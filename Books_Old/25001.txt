CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMRS BAGGETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the\r\nlong walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents\r\nof a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\' pocket. He\r\nalways breakfasted exactly at nine, and the letters were supposed to\r\nbe brought to him at a quarter past. The postman was really due at\r\nhis hall-door at a quarter before nine; but though he had lived in\r\nthe same house for above fifteen years, and though he was a man very\r\nanxious to get his letters, he had never yet learned the truth about\r\nthem. He was satisfied in his ignorance with 9.15 A.M., but on this\r\noccasion the post-boy, as usual, was ten minutes after that time. Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had got through his second cup of tea, and was stranded\r\nin his chair, having nothing to do, with the empty cup and plates\r\nbefore him for the space of two minutes; and, consequently, when he\r\nhad sent some terrible message out to the post-boy, and then had read\r\nthe one epistle which had arrived on this morning, he thus liberated\r\nhis mind: "I\'ll be whipped if I will have anything to do with her."\r\nBut this must not be taken as indicating the actual state of his\r\nmind; but simply the condition of anger to which he had been reduced\r\nby the post-boy. If any one were to explain to him afterwards that he\r\nhad so expressed himself on a subject of such importance, he would\r\nhave declared of himself that he certainly deserved to be whipped\r\nhimself. In order that he might in truth make up his mind on the\r\nsubject, he went out with his hat and stick into the long walk, and\r\nthere thought out the matter to its conclusion. The letter which he\r\nheld in his pocket ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   ST. TAWELL\'S, NORWICH, February 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR WHITTLESTAFF,--Poor Mrs Lawrie has gone at\r\n   last. She died this morning at seven o\'clock, and poor\r\n   Mary is altogether alone in the world. I have asked her\r\n   to come in among us for a few days at any rate, till the\r\n   funeral shall be over. But she has refused, knowing, I\r\n   suppose, how crowded and how small our house is. What is\r\n   she to do? You know all the circumstances much better than\r\n   I do. She says herself that she had always been intended\r\n   for a governess, and that she will, of course, follow out\r\n   the intention which had been fixed on between her and her\r\n   father before his death. But it is a most weary prospect,\r\n   especially for one who has received no direct education\r\n   for the purpose. She has devoted herself for the last\r\n   twelve months to Mrs Lawrie, as though she had been her\r\n   mother. You did not like Mrs Lawrie, nor did I; nor,\r\n   indeed, did poor Mary love her very dearly. But she, at\r\n   any rate, did her duty by her step-mother. I know that in\r\n   regard to actual money you will be generous enough; but do\r\n   turn the matter over in your mind, and endeavour to think\r\n   of some future for the poor girl.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n   EMMA KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in answer to such a letter as this, that Mr Whittlestaff had\r\ndeclared that "He\'d be whipped if he\'d have anything to do with her."\r\nBut that expression, which must not in truth be accepted as meaning\r\nanything, must not be supposed to have had even that dim shadow of a\r\nmeaning which the words may be supposed to bear. He had during the\r\nlast three months been asking himself the question as to what should\r\nbe Mary Lawrie\'s fate in life when her step-mother should have gone,\r\nand had never quite solved the question whether he could or would not\r\nbring into his own house, almost as a daughter, a young woman who\r\nwas in no way related to him. He had always begun these exercises\r\nof thought, by telling himself that the world was a censorious old\r\nfool, and that he might do just as he pleased as to making any girl\r\nhis daughter. But then, before dinner he had generally come to the\r\nconclusion that Mrs Baggett would not approve. Mrs Baggett was his\r\nhousekeeper, and was to him certainly a person of importance. He had\r\nnot even suggested the idea to Mrs Baggett, and was sure that Mrs\r\nBaggett would not approve. As to sending Mary Lawrie out into the\r\nworld as a governess;--that plan he was quite sure would not answer.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago had died his best beloved friend, Captain Patrick\r\nLawrie. With him we have not anything to do, except to say that of\r\nall men he was the most impecunious. Late in life he had married\r\na second wife,--a woman who was hard, sharp, and possessed of an\r\nannuity. The future condition of his only daughter had been a\r\nterrible grief to him; but from Mr Whittlestaff he had received\r\nassurances which had somewhat comforted him. "She shan\'t want. I\r\ncan\'t say anything further." Such had been the comfort given by Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. And since his friend\'s death Mr Whittlestaff had been\r\nliberal with presents,--which Mary had taken most unwillingly under\r\nher step-mother\'s guidance. Such had been the state of things when\r\nMr Whittlestaff received the letter. When he had been walking up\r\nand down the long walk for an extra hour, Mr Whittlestaff expressed\r\naloud the conclusion to which he had come. "I don\'t care one straw\r\nfor Mrs Baggett." It should be understood as having been uttered in\r\ndirect opposition to the first assurance made by him, that "He\'d be\r\nwhipped if he\'d have anything to do with her." In that hour he had\r\nresolved that Mary Lawrie should come to him, and be made, with all\r\npossible honours of ownership, with all its privileges and all its\r\nresponsibilities, the mistress of his house. And he made up his mind\r\nalso that such had ever been his determination. He was fifty and Mary\r\nLawrie was twenty-five. "I can do just what I please with her," he\r\nsaid to himself, "as though she were my own girl." By this he meant\r\nto imply that he would not be expected to fall in love with her, and\r\nthat it was quite out of the question that she should fall in love\r\nwith him. "Go and tell Mrs Baggett that I\'ll be much obliged to her\r\nif she\'ll put on her bonnet and come out to me here." This he said to\r\na gardener\'s boy, and the order was not at all an unusual one. When\r\nhe wanted to learn what Mrs Baggett intended to give him for dinner,\r\nhe would send for the old housekeeper and take a walk with her for\r\ntwenty minutes. Habit had made Mrs Baggett quite accustomed to the\r\nproceeding, which upon the whole she enjoyed. She now appeared with\r\na bonnet, and a wadded cloak which her master had given her. "It\'s\r\nabout that letter, sir," said Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I see the handwriting, and the black edges? Mrs Lawrie ain\'t\r\nno more."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Lawrie has gone to her long account."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afeared, sir, she won\'t find it easy to settle the bill,"\r\nsaid Mrs Baggett, who had a sharp, cynical way of expressing her\r\ndisapprobation.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Baggett, judge not, lest you be judged." Mrs Baggett turned up\r\nher nose and snuffed the air. "The woman has gone, and nothing shall\r\nbe said against her here. The girl remains. Now, I\'ll tell you what I\r\nmean to do."\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t to come here, Mr Whittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"Here she is to come, and here she is to remain, and here she is to\r\nhave her part of everything as though she were my own daughter. And,\r\nas not the smallest portion of the good things that is to come to\r\nher, she is to have her share in your heart, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know nothing about my heart, Mr Whittlestaff. Them as finds\r\ntheir way to my heart has to work their way there. Who\'s Miss Lawrie,\r\nthat I\'m to be knocked about for a new comer?"\r\n\r\n"She is just Mary Lawrie."\r\n\r\n"I\'m that old that I don\'t feel like having a young missus put over\r\nme. And it ain\'t for your good, Mr Whittlestaff. You ain\'t a young\r\nman--nor you ain\'t an old un; and she ain\'t no relations to you.\r\nThat\'s the worst part of it. As sure as my name is Dorothy Baggett,\r\nyou\'ll be falling in love with her." Then Mrs Baggett, with the\r\nsense of the audacity of what she had said, looked him full in the\r\nface and violently shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Now go in," he said, "and pack my things up for three nights. I\'m\r\ngoing to Norwich, and I shan\'t want any dinner. Tell John I shall\r\nwant the cart, and he must be ready to go with me to the station at\r\n2.15."\r\n\r\n"I ought to be ready to cut the tongue out of my head," said Mrs\r\nBaggett as she returned to the house, "for I might have known it was\r\nthe way to make him start at once."\r\n\r\nNot in three days, but before the end of the week, Mr Whittlestaff\r\nreturned home, bringing with him a dark-featured tall girl, clothed,\r\nof course, in deepest mourning from head to foot. To Mrs Baggett she\r\nwas an object of intense interest; because, although she had by no\r\nmeans assented to her master\'s proposal, made on behalf of the young\r\nlady, and did tell herself again and again during Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\nabsence that she was quite sure that Mary Lawrie was a baggage, yet\r\nin her heart she knew it to be impossible that she could go on living\r\nin the house without loving one whom her master loved. With regard\r\nto most of those concerned in the household, she had her own way.\r\nUnless she would favour the groom, and the gardener, and the boy,\r\nand the girls who served below her, Mr Whittlestaff would hardly be\r\ncontented with those subordinates. He was the easiest master under\r\nwhom a servant could live. But his favour had to be won through Mrs\r\nBaggett\'s smiles. During the last two years, however, there had been\r\nenough of discussion about Mary Lawrie to convince Mrs Baggett that,\r\nin regard to this "interloper," as Mrs Baggett had once called her,\r\nMr Whittlestaff intended to have his own way. Such being the case,\r\nMrs Baggett was most anxious to know whether the young lady was such\r\nas she could love.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when the young lady had come, Mrs Baggett, for\r\ntwelve months, could not quite make up her mind. The young lady was\r\nvery different from what she had expected. Of interference in the\r\nhouse there was almost literally none. Mary had evidently heard\r\nmuch of Mrs Baggett\'s virtues,--and infirmities,--and seemed to\r\nunderstand that she also had in many things to place herself under\r\nMrs Baggett\'s orders. "Lord love you, Miss Mary," she was heard\r\nto say; "as if we did not all understand that you was to be missus\r\nof everything at Croker\'s Hall,"--for such was the name of Mr\r\nWhittlestaff\'s house. But those who heard it knew that the words\r\nwere spoken in supreme good humour, and judged from that, that Mrs\r\nBaggett\'s heart had been won. But Mrs Baggett still had her fears;\r\nand was not yet resolved but that it might be her duty to turn\r\nagainst Mary Lawrie with all the violence in her power. For the first\r\nmonth or two after the young lady\'s arrival, she had almost made\r\nup her mind that Mary Lawrie would never consent to become Mrs\r\nWhittlestaff. An old gentleman will seldom fall in love without some\r\nencouragement; or at any rate, will not tell his love. Mary Lawrie\r\nwas as cold to him as though he had been seventy-five instead of\r\nfifty. And she was also as dutiful,--by which she showed Mrs Baggett\r\nmore strongly even than by her coldness, that any idea of marriage\r\nwas on her part out of the question.\r\n\r\nThis, strange to say, Mrs Baggett resented. For though she certainly\r\nfelt, as would do any ordinary Mrs Baggett in her position, that a\r\nwife would be altogether detrimental to her interest in life, yet she\r\ncould not endure to think that "a little stuck-up minx, taken in from\r\ncharity," should run counter to any of her master\'s wishes. On one or\r\ntwo occasions she had spoken to Mr Whittlestaff respecting the young\r\nlady and had been cruelly snubbed. This certainly did not create\r\ngood humour on her part, and she began to fancy herself angry in that\r\nthe young lady was so ceremonious with her master. But as months ran\r\nby she felt that Mary was thawing, and that Mr Whittlestaff was\r\nbecoming more affectionate. Of course there were periods in which her\r\nmind veered round. But at the end of the year Mrs Baggett certainly\r\ndid wish that the young lady should marry her old master. "I can\r\ngo down to Portsmouth," she said to the baker, who was a most\r\nrespectable old man, and was nearer to Mrs Baggett\'s confidence\r\nthan any one else except her master, "and weary out the rest on \'em\r\nthere." When she spoke of "wearying out the rest on \'em," her friend\r\nperfectly understood that she alluded to what years she might still\r\nhave to live, and to the abject misery of her latter days, which\r\nwould be the consequence of her resigning her present mode of life.\r\nMrs Baggett was supposed to have been born at Portsmouth, and,\r\ntherefore, to allude to that one place which she knew in the world\r\nover and beyond the residences in which her master and her master\'s\r\nfamily had resided.\r\n\r\nBefore I go on to describe the characters of Mr Whittlestaff and\r\nMiss Lawrie, I must devote a few words to the early life of Mrs\r\nBaggett. Dorothy Tedcaster had been born in the house of Admiral\r\nWhittlestaff, the officer in command at the Portsmouth dockyard.\r\nThere her father or her mother had family connections, to visit whom\r\nDorothy, when a young woman, had returned from the then abode of her\r\nloving mistress, Mrs Whittlestaff. With Mrs Whittlestaff she had\r\nlived absolutely from the hour of her birth, and of Mrs Whittlestaff\r\nher mind was so full, that she did conceive her to be superior, if\r\nnot absolutely in rank, at any rate in all the graces and favours of\r\nlife, to her Majesty and all the royal family. Dorothy in an evil\r\nhour went back to Portsmouth, and there encountered that worst of\r\nmilitary heroes, Sergeant Baggett. With many lamentations, and\r\nconfessions as to her own weakness, she wrote to her mistress,\r\nacknowledging that she did intend to marry "B." Mrs Whittlestaff\r\ncould do nothing to prevent it, and Dorothy did marry "B." Of the\r\nmisery and ill-usage, of the dirt and poverty, which poor Dorothy\r\nBaggett endured during that year, it needs not here to tell. That\r\nsomething had passed between her and her old mistress when she\r\nreturned to her, must, I suppose, have been necessary. But of her\r\nmarried life, in subsequent years, Mrs Baggett never spoke at all.\r\nEven the baker only knew dimly that there had been a Sergeant Baggett\r\nin existence. Years had passed since that bad quarter of an hour\r\nin her life, before Mrs Baggett had been made over to her present\r\nmaster. And he, though he probably knew something of the abominable\r\nSergeant, never found it necessary to mention his name. For this Mrs\r\nBaggett was duly thankful, and would declare among all persons, the\r\nbaker included, that "for a gentleman to be a gentleman, no gentleman\r\nwas such a gentleman" as her master.\r\n\r\nIt was now five-and-twenty years since the Admiral had died, and\r\nfifteen since his widow had followed him. During the latter period\r\nMrs Baggett had lived at Croker\'s Hall with Mr Whittlestaff, and\r\nwithin that period something had leaked out as to the Sergeant. How\r\nit had come to pass that Mr Whittlestaff\'s establishment had been\r\nmounted with less of the paraphernalia of wealth than that of his\r\nparents, shall be told in the next chapter; but it was the case that\r\nMrs Baggett, in her very heart of hearts, was deeply grieved at what\r\nshe considered to be the poverty of her master. "You\'re a stupid\r\nold fool, Mrs Baggett," her master would say, when in some private\r\nmoments her regrets would be expressed. "Haven\'t you got enough\r\nto eat, and a bed to lie on, and an old stocking full of money\r\nsomewhere? What more do you want?"\r\n\r\n"A stocking full of money!" she would say, wiping her eyes; "there\r\nain\'t no such thing. And as for eating, of course, I eats as much as\r\nI wants. I eats more than I wants, if you come to that."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re very greedy."\r\n\r\n"But to think that you shouldn\'t have a man in a black coat to pour\r\nout a glass of wine for you, sir!"\r\n\r\n"I never drink wine, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"Well, whisky. I suppose a fellow like that wouldn\'t be above pouring\r\nout a glass of whisky for a gentleman;--though there\'s no knowing now\r\nwhat those fellows won\'t turn up their noses at. But it\'s a come-down\r\nin the world, Mr Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"If you think I\'ve come down in the world, you\'d better keep it to\r\nyourself, and not tell me. I don\'t think that I\'ve come down."\r\n\r\n"You bear up against it finely like a man, sir; but for a poor woman\r\nlike me, I do feel it." Such was Mrs Baggett and the record of her\r\nlife. But this little conversation took place before the coming of\r\nMary Lawrie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff had not been a fortunate man, as fortune is\r\ngenerally counted in the world. He had not succeeded in what he had\r\nattempted. He had, indeed, felt but little his want of success in\r\nregard to money, but he had encountered failure in one or two other\r\nmatters which had touched him nearly. In some things his life had\r\nbeen successful; but these were matters in which the world does not\r\nwrite down a man\'s good luck as being generally conducive to his\r\nhappiness. He had never had a headache, rarely a cold, and not a\r\ntouch of the gout. One little finger had become crooked, and he was\r\nrecommended to drink whisky, which he did willingly,--because it was\r\ncheap. He was now fifty, and as fit, bodily and mentally, for hard\r\nwork as ever he had been. And he had a thousand a-year to spend, and\r\nspent it without ever feeling the necessity of saving a shilling. And\r\nthen he hated no one, and those who came in contact with him always\r\nliked him. He trod on nobody\'s corns, and was, generally speaking,\r\nthe most popular man in the parish. These traits are not generally\r\nreckoned as marks of good fortune; but they do tend to increase the\r\namount of happiness which a man enjoys in this world. To tell of\r\nhis misfortunes a somewhat longer chronicle of his life would be\r\nnecessary. But the circumstances need only be indicated here. He had\r\nbeen opposed in everything to his father\'s views. His father, finding\r\nhim to be a clever lad, had at first designed him for the Bar. But\r\nhe, before he had left Oxford, utterly repudiated all legal pursuits.\r\n"What the devil do you wish to be?" said his father, who at that\r\ntime was supposed to be able to leave his son L2000 a-year. The son\r\nreplied that he would work for a fellowship, and devote himself to\r\nliterature. The old admiral sent literature to all the infernal gods,\r\nand told his son that he was a fool. But the lad did not succeed in\r\ngetting his fellowship, and neither father nor mother ever knew the\r\namount of suffering which he endured thereby. He became plaintive\r\nand wrote poetry, and spent his pocket-money in publishing it, which\r\nagain caused him sorrow, not for the loss of his money, but by the\r\nobscurity of his poetry. He had to confess to himself that God\r\nhad not conferred upon him the gift of writing poetry; and having\r\nacknowledged so much, he never again put two lines together. Of all\r\nthis he said nothing; but the sense of failure made him sad at heart.\r\nAnd his father, when he was in those straits, only laughed at him,\r\nnot at all believing the assurances of his son\'s misery, which from\r\ntime to time were given to him by his wife.\r\n\r\nThen the old admiral declared that, as his son would do nothing for\r\nhimself, he must work for his son. And he took in his old age to\r\ngoing into the city and speculating in shares. Then the Admiral\r\ndied. The shares came to nothing, and calls were made; and when\r\nMrs Whittlestaff followed her husband, her son, looking about him,\r\nbought Croker\'s Hall, reduced his establishment, and put down the\r\nman-servant whose departed glory was to Mrs Baggett a matter of such\r\ndeep regret.\r\n\r\nBut before this time Mr Whittlestaff had encountered the greatest\r\nsorrow of his life. Even the lost fellowship, even the rejected\r\npoetry, had not caused him such misery as this. He had loved a young\r\nlady, and had been accepted;--and then the young lady had jilted him.\r\nAt this time of his life he was about thirty; and as to the outside\r\nworld, he was absolutely dumfounded by the catastrophe. Up to this\r\nperiod he had been a sportsman in a moderate degree, fishing a good\r\ndeal, shooting a little, and devoted to hunting, to the extent of a\r\nsingle horse. But when the blow came, he never fished or shot, or\r\nhunted again. I think that the young lady would hardly have treated\r\nhim so badly had she known what the effect would be. Her name was\r\nCatherine Bailey, and she married one Compas, who, as years went\r\non, made a considerable reputation as an Old Bailey barrister. His\r\nfriends feared at the time that Mr Whittlestaff would do some injury\r\neither to himself or Mr Compas. But no one dared to speak to him on\r\nthe subject. His mother, indeed, did dare,--or half dared. But he so\r\nanswered his mother that he stopped her before the speech was out\r\nof her mouth. "Don\'t say a word, mother; I cannot bear it." And he\r\nstalked out of the house, and was not seen for many hours.\r\n\r\nThere had then, in the bitter agony of his spirit, come upon him an\r\nidea of blood. He himself must go,--or the man. Then he remembered\r\nthat she was the man\'s wife, and that it behoved him to spare\r\nthe man for her sake. Then, when he came to think in earnest of\r\nself-destruction, he told himself that it was a coward\'s refuge. He\r\ntook to his classics for consolation, and read the philosophy of\r\nCicero, and the history of Livy, and the war chronicles of Caesar.\r\nThey did him good,--in the same way that the making of many shoes\r\nwould have done him good had he been a shoemaker. In catching fishes\r\nand riding after foxes he could not give his mind to the occupation,\r\nso as to abstract his thoughts. But Cicero\'s de Natura Deorum was\r\nmore effectual. Gradually he returned to a gentle cheerfulness of\r\nlife, but he never burst out again into the violent exercise of\r\nshooting a pheasant. After that his mother died, and again he was\r\ncalled upon to endure a lasting sorrow. But on this occasion the\r\nsorrow was of that kind which is softened by having been expected. He\r\nrarely spoke of his mother,--had never, up to this period at which\r\nour tale finds him, mentioned his mother\'s name to any of those about\r\nhim. Mrs Baggett would speak of her, saying much in the praise of\r\nher old mistress. Mr Whittlestaff would smile and seem pleased, and\r\nso the subject would pass away. There was something too reverend\r\nto him in his idea of his mother, to admit of his discussing her\r\ncharacter with the servant. But he was well pleased to hear her thus\r\ndescribed. Of the other woman, of Catherine Bailey, of her who had\r\nfalsely given herself up to so poor a creature as Compas, after\r\nhaving received the poetry of his vows, he could endure no mention\r\nwhatever; and though Mrs Baggett knew probably well the whole story,\r\nno attempt at naming the name was ever made.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the successes and the failures of Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\nlife when Mary Lawrie was added as one to his household. The same\r\nidea had occurred to him as to Mrs Baggett. He was not a young man,\r\nbecause he was fifty; but he was not quite an old man, because he\r\nwas only fifty. He had seen Mary Lawrie often enough, and had become\r\nsufficiently well acquainted with her to feel sure that if he could\r\nwin her she would be a loving companion for the remainder of his\r\nlife. He had turned it all over in his mind, and had been now eager\r\nabout it and now bashful. On more than one occasion he had declared\r\nto himself that he would be whipped if he would have anything to\r\ndo with her. Should he subject himself again to some such agony of\r\ndespair as he had suffered in the matter of Catherine Bailey? It\r\nmight not be an agony such as that; but to him to ask and to be\r\ndenied would be a terrible pain. And as the girl did receive from\r\nhis hands all that she had--her bread and meat, her bed, her very\r\nclothes--would it not be better for her that he should stand to her\r\nin the place of a father than a lover? She might come to accept it\r\nall and not think much of it, if he would take before himself the\r\nguise of an old man. But were he to appear before her as a suitor for\r\nher hand, would she refuse him? Looking forward, he could perceive\r\nthat there was room for infinite grief if he should make the attempt\r\nand then things should not go well with him.\r\n\r\nBut the more he saw of her he was sure also that there was room for\r\ninfinite joy. He compared her in his mind to Catherine Bailey, and\r\ncould not but feel that in his youth he had been blind and fatuous.\r\nCatherine had been a fair-haired girl, and had now blossomed out\r\ninto the anxious mother of ten fair-haired children. The anxiety had\r\nno doubt come from the evil courses of her husband. Had she been\r\ncontented to be Mrs Whittlestaff, there might have been no such look\r\nof care, and there might perhaps have been less than ten children;\r\nbut she would still have been fair-haired, blowsy, and fat. Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had with infinite trouble found an opportunity of seeing\r\nher and her flock, unseen by them, and a portion of his agony had\r\nsubsided. But still there was the fact that she had promised to be\r\nhis, and had become a thing sacred in his sight, and had then given\r\nherself up to the arms of Mr Compas. But now if Mary Lawrie would\r\nbut accept him, how blessed might be the evening of his life!\r\n\r\nHe had confessed to himself often enough how sad and dreary he was\r\nin his desolate life. He had told himself that it must be so for the\r\nremainder of all time to him, when Catherine Bailey had declared her\r\npurpose to him of marrying the successful young lawyer. He had at\r\nonce made up his mind that his doom was fixed, and had not regarded\r\nhis solitude as any deep aggravation of his sorrow. But he had come\r\nby degrees to find that a man should not give up his life because of\r\na fickle girl, and especially when he found her to be the mother of\r\nten flaxen haired infants. He had, too, as he declared to himself,\r\nwaited long enough.\r\n\r\nBut Mary Lawrie was very different from Catherine Bailey. The\r\nCatherine he had known had been bright, and plump, and joyous, with a\r\nquick good-natured wit, and a rippling laughter, which by its silvery\r\nsound had robbed him of his heart. There was no plumpness, and no\r\nsilver-sounding laughter with Mary. She shall be described in the\r\nnext chapter. Let it suffice to say here that she was somewhat staid\r\nin her demeanour, and not at all given to putting herself forward in\r\nconversation. But every hour that he passed in her company he became\r\nmore and more sure that, if any wife could now make him happy, this\r\nwas the woman who could do so.\r\n\r\nBut of her manner to himself he doubted much. She was gratitude\r\nitself for what he was prepared to do for her. But with her gratitude\r\nwas mingled respect, and almost veneration. She treated him at first\r\nalmost as a servant,--at any rate with none of the familiarity of a\r\nfriend, and hardly with the reserve of a grown-up child. Gradually,\r\nin obedience to his evident wishes, she did drop her reserve,\r\nand allowed herself to converse with him; but it was always as a\r\nyoung person might with all modesty converse with her superior. He\r\nstruggled hard to overcome her reticence, and did at last succeed.\r\nBut still there was that respect, verging almost into veneration,\r\nwhich seemed to crush him when he thought that he might begin to play\r\nthe lover.\r\n\r\nHe had got a pony carriage for her, which he insisted that she should\r\ndrive herself. "But I never have driven," she had said, taking her\r\nplace, and doubtfully assuming the reins, while he sat beside her.\r\nShe had at this time been six months at Croker\'s Hall.\r\n\r\n"There must be a beginning for everything, and you shall begin to\r\ndrive now." Then he took great trouble with her, teaching her how to\r\nhold the reins, and how to use the whip, till at last something of\r\nfamiliarity was engendered. And he went out with her, day after day,\r\nshowing her all those pretty haunts among the downs which are to be\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of Alresford.\r\n\r\nThis did well for a time, and Mr Whittlestaff thought that he was\r\nprogressing. But he had not as yet quite made up his mind that the\r\nattempt should be made at all. If he can be imagined to have talked\r\nto a friend as he talked to himself, that friend would have averred\r\nthat he spoke more frequently against marriage,--or rather against\r\nthe young lady\'s marriage,--than in favour of it. "After all it will\r\nnever do," he would have said to this friend; "I am an old man, and\r\nan old man shouldn\'t ask a young girl to sacrifice herself. Mrs\r\nBaggett looks on it only as a question of butchers and bakers. There\r\nare, no doubt, circumstances in which butchers and bakers do come\r\nuppermost. But here the butchers and bakers are provided. I wouldn\'t\r\nhave her marry me for that sake. Love, I fear, is out of the\r\nquestion. But for gratitude I would not have her do it." It was thus\r\nthat he would commonly have been found speaking to his friend. There\r\nwere moments in which he roused himself to better hopes,--when he had\r\ndrank his glass of whisky and water, and was somewhat elate with the\r\nconsequences. "I\'ll do it," he would then have said to his friend;\r\n"only I cannot exactly say when." And so it went on, till at last he\r\nbecame afraid to speak out and tell her what he wanted.\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff was a tall, thin man, not quite six feet, with a\r\nface which a judge of male beauty would hardly call handsome, but\r\nwhich all would say was impressive and interesting. We seldom\r\nthink how much is told to us of the owner\'s character by the\r\nfirst or second glance of a man or woman\'s face. Is he a fool, or\r\nis he clever; is he reticent or outspoken; is he passionate or\r\nlong-suffering;--nay, is he honest or the reverse; is he malicious\r\nor of a kindly nature? Of all these things we form a sudden judgment\r\nwithout any thought; and in most of our sudden judgments we are\r\nroughly correct. It is so, or seems to us to be so, as a matter of\r\ncourse,--that the man is a fool, or reticent, or malicious; and,\r\nwithout giving a thought to our own phrenological capacity, we pass\r\non with the conviction. No one ever considered that Mr Whittlestaff\r\nwas a fool or malicious; but people did think that he was reticent\r\nand honest. The inner traits of his character were very difficult to\r\nbe read. Even Mrs Baggett had hardly read them all correctly. He was\r\nshamefaced to such a degree that Mrs Baggett could not bring herself\r\nto understand it. And there was present to him a manner of speech\r\nwhich practice had now made habitual, but which he had originally\r\nadopted with the object of hiding his shamefacedness under the veil\r\nof a dashing manner. He would speak as though he were quite free\r\nwith his thoughts, when, at the moment, he feared that thoughts\r\nshould be read of which he certainly had no cause to be ashamed. His\r\nfellowship, his poetry, and his early love were all, to his thinking,\r\ncauses of disgrace, which required to be buried deep within his own\r\nmemory. But the true humility with which he regarded them betokened a\r\ncharacter for which he need not have blushed. But that he thought of\r\nthose matters at all--that he thought of himself at all--was a matter\r\nto be buried deep within his own bosom.\r\n\r\nThrough his short dark-brown hair the grey locks were beginning to\r\nshow themselves--signs indeed of age, but signs which were very\r\nbecoming to him. At fifty he was a much better-looking man than he\r\nhad been at thirty,--so that that foolish, fickle girl, Catherine\r\nBailey, would not have rejected him for the cruelly sensuous face\r\nof Mr Compas, had the handsome iron-grey tinge been then given to\r\nhis countenance. He, as he looked at the glass, told himself that a\r\ngrey-haired old fool, such as he was, had no right to burden the life\r\nof a young girl, simply because he found her in bread and meat. That\r\nhe should think himself good-looking, was to his nature impossible.\r\nHis eyes were rather small, but very bright; the eyebrows black and\r\nalmost bushy; his nose was well-formed and somewhat long, but not so\r\nas to give that peculiar idea of length to his face which comes from\r\ngreat nasal prolongation. His upper lip was short, and his mouth\r\nlarge and manly. The strength of his character was better shown by\r\nhis mouth than by any other feature. He wore hardly any beard, as\r\nbeards go now,--unless indeed a whisker can be called a beard, which\r\ncame down, closely shorn, about half an inch below his ear. "A very\r\ncommon sort of individual," he said of himself, as he looked in the\r\nglass when Mary Lawrie had been already twelve months in the house;\r\n"but then a man ought to be common. A man who is uncommon is either a\r\ndandy or a buffoon."\r\n\r\nHis clothes were all made after one pattern and of one colour. He\r\nhad, indeed, his morning clothes and his evening clothes. Those for\r\nthe morning were very nearly black, whereas for the evening they were\r\nentirely so. He walked about the neighbourhood in a soft hat such as\r\nclergymen now affect, and on Sundays he went to church with the old\r\nwell-established respectable chimney-pot. On Sundays, too, he carried\r\nan umbrella, whereas on week-days he always had a large stick; and it\r\nwas observed that neither the umbrella nor the stick was adapted to\r\nthe state of the weather.\r\n\r\nSuch was Mr Whittlestaff of Croker\'s Hall, a small residence\r\nwhich stood half-way up on the way to the downs, about a mile from\r\nAlresford. He had come into the neighbourhood, having bought a small\r\nfreehold property without the knowledge of any of the inhabitants.\r\n"It was just as though he had come out of the sun," said the old\r\nbaker, forgetting that most men, or their ancestors, must have come\r\nto their present residences after a similar fashion. And he had\r\nbrought Mrs Baggett with him, who had confided to the baker that she\r\nhad felt herself that strange on her first arrival that she didn\'t\r\nknow whether she was standing on her head or her heels.\r\n\r\nMrs Baggett had since become very gracious with various of the\r\nneighbours. She had the paying of Mr Whittlestaff\'s bills, and the\r\ngeneral disposal of his custom. From thence arose her popularity.\r\nBut he, during the last fifteen years, had crept silently into the\r\nsociety of the place. At first no one had known anything about him;\r\nand the neighbourhood had been shy. But by degrees the parsons and\r\nthen the squires had taken him by the hand, so that the social\r\nendowments of the place were more than Mr Whittlestaff even desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMARY LAWRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more difficult in the writing of a story than to\r\ndescribe adequately the person of a hero or a heroine, so as to place\r\nbefore the mind of the reader any clear picture of him or her who\r\nis described. A courtship is harder still--so hard that we may say\r\ngenerally that it is impossible. Southey\'s Lodore is supposed to have\r\nbeen effective; but let any one with the words in his memory stand\r\nbeside the waterfall and say whether it is such as the words have\r\npainted it. It rushes and it foams, as described by the poet, much\r\nmore violently than does the real water; and so does everything\r\ndescribed, unless in the hands of a wonderful master. But I have\r\nclear images on my brain of the characters of the persons introduced.\r\nI know with fair accuracy what was intended by the character as given\r\nof Amelia Booth, of Clarissa, of Di Vernon, and of Maggie Tulliver.\r\nBut as their persons have not been drawn with the pencil for me by\r\nthe artists who themselves created them, I have no conception how\r\nthey looked. Of Thackeray\'s Beatrix I have a vivid idea, because\r\nshe was drawn for him by an artist under his own eye. I have now to\r\ndescribe Mary Lawrie, but have no artist who will take the trouble\r\nto learn my thoughts and to reproduce them. Consequently I fear that\r\nno true idea of the young lady can be conveyed to the reader; and\r\nthat I must leave him to entertain such a notion of her carriage and\r\ndemeanour as must come to him at the end from the reading of the\r\nwhole book.\r\n\r\nBut the attempt must be made, if only for fashion sake, so that no\r\nadventitious help may be wanting to him, or more probably to her, who\r\nmay care to form for herself a personification of Mary Lawrie. She\r\nwas a tall, thin, staid girl, who never put herself forward in any of\r\nthose walks of life in which such a young lady as she is called upon\r\nto show herself. She was silent and reserved, and sometimes startled,\r\neven when appealed to in a household so quiet as that of Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. Those who had seen her former life had known that she\r\nhad lived under the dominion of her step-mother, and had so accounted\r\nfor her manner. And then, added to this, was the sense of entire\r\ndependence on a stranger, which, no doubt, helped to quell her\r\nspirit. But Mr Whittlestaff had eyes with which to see and ears with\r\nwhich to hear, and was not to be taken in by the outward appearance\r\nof the young lady. He had perceived that under that quiet guise and\r\ntimid startled look there existed a power of fighting a battle for\r\nherself or for a friend, if an occasion should arise which should\r\nappear to herself to be sufficient. He had known her as one of her\r\nfather\'s household, and of her step-mother\'s; and had seen probably\r\nsome little instance of self-assertion, such as had not yet made\r\nitself apparent to Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\nA man who had met her once, and for a few minutes only, would\r\ncertainly not declare her to be beautiful. She, too, like Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, was always contented to pass unobserved. But the chance\r\nman, had he seen her for long, would surely remark that Miss Lawrie\r\nwas an attractive girl; and had he heard her talk freely on any\r\nmatter of interest, would have called her very attractive. She would\r\nblaze up into sudden eloquence, and then would become shame-stricken,\r\nand abashed, and dumfounded, so as to show that she had for a\r\nmoment forgotten her audience, and then the audience,--the chance\r\nman,--would surely set his wits to work and try to reproduce in her a\r\nrenewal of that intimacy to which she had seemed to yield herself for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nBut yet I am not describing her after the accepted fashion. I should\r\nproduce a catalogue of features, and tell how every one of them\r\nwas formed. Her hair was dark, and worn very plain, but with that\r\ngraceful care which shows that the owner has not slurred over her\r\ntoilet with hurried negligence. Of complexion it can hardly be said\r\nthat she had any; so little was the appearance of her countenance\r\ndiversified by a change of hue. If I am bound to declare her colour,\r\nI must, in truth, say that she was brown. There was none even of that\r\nflying hue which is supposed to be intended when a woman is called a\r\nbrunette. When she first came to Croker\'s Hall, health produced no\r\nvariation. Nor did any such come quickly; though before she had lived\r\nthere a year and a half, now and again a slight tinge of dark ruby\r\nwould show itself on her cheek, and then vanish almost quicker than\r\nit had come. Mr Whittlestaff, when he would see this, would be\r\nalmost beside himself in admiration.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were deep blue, so deep that the casual observer would not\r\nat first recognise their colour. But when you had perceived that they\r\nwere blue, and had brought the fact home to your knowledge, their\r\nblueness remained with you as a thing fixed for ever. And you would\r\nfeel, if you yourself were thoughtful and contemplative, and much\r\ngiven to study a lady\'s eyes, that, such as they were, every lady\r\nwould possess the like if only it were given to her to choose.\r\n\r\nHer nose was slight and fine, and perhaps lent to her face, of all\r\nher features, its most special grace. Her lips, alas! were too thin\r\nfor true female beauty, and lacked that round and luscious fulness\r\nwhich seems in many a girl\'s face to declare the purpose for which\r\nthey were made. Through them her white teeth would occasionally be\r\nseen, and then her face was at its best, as, for instance, when she\r\nwas smiling; but that was seldom; and at other moments it seemed as\r\nthough she were too careful to keep her mouth closed.\r\n\r\nBut if her mouth was defective, the symmetry of her chin, carrying\r\nwith it the oval of her cheek and jaws, was perfect. How many a\r\nface, otherwise lovely to look upon, is made mean and comparatively\r\nbase, either by the lengthening or the shortening of the chin! That\r\nabsolute perfection which Miss Lawrie owned, we do not, perhaps,\r\noften meet. But when found, I confess that nothing to me gives so\r\nsure an evidence of true blood and good-breeding.\r\n\r\nSuch is the catalogue of Mary Lawrie\'s features, drawn out with care\r\nby one who has delighted for many hours to sit and look at them.\r\nAll the power of language which the writer possesses has been used\r\nin thus reproducing them. But now, when this portion of his work\r\nis done, he feels sure that no reader of his novel will have the\r\nslightest idea of what Mary Lawrie was like.\r\n\r\nAn incident must now be told of her early life, of which she never\r\nspoke to man, woman, or child. Her step-mother had known the\r\ncircumstance, but had rarely spoken of it. There had come across her\r\npath in Norwich a young man who had stirred her heart, and had won\r\nher affections. But the young man had passed on, and there, as far as\r\nthe present and the past were concerned, had been an end of it. The\r\nyoung man had been no favourite with her step-mother; and her father,\r\nwho was almost on his death-bed, had heard what was going on almost\r\nwithout a remark. He had been told that the man was penniless, and\r\nas his daughter had been to him the dearest thing upon earth, he had\r\nbeen glad to save himself the pain of expressing disapproval. John\r\nGordon had, however, been a gentleman, and was fit in all things to\r\nbe the husband of such a girl as Mary Lawrie,--except that he was\r\npenniless, and she, also, had possessed nothing. He had passed on his\r\nway without speaking, and had gone--even Mary did not know whither.\r\nShe had accepted her fate, and had never allowed the name of John\r\nGordon to pass her lips.\r\n\r\nThe days passed very quickly at Croker\'s Hall, but not so quickly but\r\nthat Mary knew well what was going on in Mr Whittlestaff\'s mind. How\r\nis it that a girl understands to a certainty the state of a man\'s\r\nheart in regard to her,--or rather, not his heart, but his purpose? A\r\ngirl may believe that a man loves her, and may be deceived; but she\r\nwill not be deceived as to whether he wishes to marry her. Gradually\r\ncame the conviction on Miss Lawrie\'s mind of Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\npurpose. And, as it did so, came the conviction also that she could\r\nnot do it. Of this he saw nothing; but he was instigated by it to\r\nbe more eager,--and was at the same time additionally abashed by\r\nsomething in her manner which made him feel that the task before him\r\nwas not an easy one.\r\n\r\nMrs Baggett, who knew well all the symptoms as her master displayed\r\nthem, became angry with Mary Lawrie. Who was Mary Lawrie, that she\r\nshould take upon herself to deny Mr Whittlestaff anything? No\r\ndoubt it would, as she told herself, be better for Mrs Baggett in\r\nmany respects that her master should remain unmarried. She assured\r\nherself that if a mistress were put over her head, she must retire\r\nto Portsmouth,--which, of all places for her, had the dreariest\r\nmemories. She could remain where she was very well, while Mary Lawrie\r\nremained also where she was. But it provoked her to think that the\r\noffer should be made to the girl and should be refused. "What on\r\nearth it is they sees in \'em, is what I never can understand. She\r\nain\'t pretty,--not to say,--and she looks as though butter wouldn\'t\r\nmelt in her mouth. But she\'s got it inside her, and some of them days\r\nit\'ll come out." Then Mrs Baggett determined that she would have a\r\nfew words on the subject with Mary Lawrie.\r\n\r\nMary had now been a year and four months at Croker\'s Hall, and had,\r\nunder pressure from Mr Whittlestaff, assumed something of the manner\r\nrather than of the airs of a mistress to Mrs Baggett. This the old\r\nwoman did not at all resent, because the reality of power was still\r\nin her hands; but she could not endure that the idolatry of love\r\nshould always be present in her master\'s face. If the young woman\r\nwould only become Mrs Whittlestaff, then the idolatry would pass\r\naway. At any rate, her master would not continue "to make an ass of\r\nhimself," as Mrs Baggett phrased it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think, Miss, as that Mr Whittlestaff is looking very\r\npeeky?"\r\n\r\n"Is he, Mrs Baggett?"\r\n\r\n"\'Deed and he is, to my thinking; and it\'s all along of you. He\'s got\r\na fancy into his mind,--and why shouldn\'t he have his fancy?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m sure." But Mary did know. She did know what the\r\nfancy was, and why Mr Whittlestaff shouldn\'t have it.\r\n\r\n"I tell you fairly, Miss, there is nothing I hate so much as vagaries\r\nin young women."\r\n\r\n"I hope there are no vagaries to be hated in me, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not quite so sure. You do go as straightforward as most\r\non \'em; but I ain\'t quite sure but that there are a few twists and\r\ntwirls. What do you suppose he wants to be at?"\r\n\r\n"How am I to say?" Then she bethought herself that were she to tell\r\nthe truth, she could say very well.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean as you don\'t know?" said the old woman.\r\n\r\n"Am I bound to tell you if I do know?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish to do the best for him, you are. What\'s the good of\r\nbeating about the bush? Why don\'t you have him?"\r\n\r\nMary did not quite know whether it behoved her to be angry with the\r\nold servant, and if so, how she was to show her anger. "You shouldn\'t\r\ntalk such nonsense, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well. It is all nonsense; but nonsense has to be\r\ntalked sometimes. Here\'s a gentleman as you owe everything to. If he\r\nwanted your head from your shoulders, you shouldn\'t make any scruple.\r\nWhat are you, that you shouldn\'t let a gentleman like him have his\r\nown way? Asking your pardon, but I don\'t mean it any way out of\r\ndisrespect. Of course it would be all agin me. An old woman doesn\'t\r\nwant to have a young mistress over her head, and if she\'s my sperrit,\r\nshe wouldn\'t bear it. I won\'t, any way."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you ask me to do this thing?"\r\n\r\n"Because a gentleman like him should have his own way. And an old hag\r\nlike me shouldn\'t stand for anything. No more shouldn\'t a young woman\r\nlike you who has had so much done for her. Now, Miss Mary, you see\r\nI\'ve told you my mind freely."\r\n\r\n"But he has never asked me."\r\n\r\n"You just sit close up to him, and he\'ll ask you free enough. I\r\nshouldn\'t speak as I have done if there had been a morsel of doubt\r\nabout it. Do you doubt it yourself, Miss?" To this Miss Lawrie did\r\nnot find it necessary to return any answer.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Baggett had gone and Mary was left to herself, she could\r\nnot but think over what the woman had said to her. In the first\r\nplace, was she not bound to be angry with the woman, and to express\r\nher anger? Was it not impertinent, nay, almost indecent, that the\r\nwoman should come to her and interrogate her on such a subject?\r\nThe inmost, most secret feelings of her heart had been ruthlessly\r\ninquired into and probed by a menial servant, who had asked questions\r\nof her, and made suggestions to her, as though her part in the affair\r\nhad been of no consequence. "What are you, that you shouldn\'t let\r\na gentleman like him have his own way?" Why was it not so much to\r\nher as to Mr Whittlestaff? Was it not her all; the consummation\r\nor destruction of every hope; the making or unmaking of her joy or\r\nof her happiness? Could it be right that she should marry any man,\r\nmerely because the man wanted her? Were there to be no questions\r\nraised as to her own life, her own contentment, her own ideas of what\r\nwas proper? It was true that this woman knew nothing of John Gordon.\r\nBut she must have known that there might be a John Gordon,--whom\r\nshe, Mary Lawrie, was required to set on one side, merely because Mr\r\nWhittlestaff "wanted her." Mrs Baggett had been grossly impertinent\r\nin daring to talk to her of Mr Whittlestaff\'s wants.\r\n\r\nBut then, as she walked slowly round the garden, she found herself\r\nbound to inquire of herself whether what the woman said had not been\r\ntrue. Did she not eat his bread; did she not wear his clothes; were\r\nnot the very boots on her feet his property? And she was there in his\r\nhouse, without the slightest tie of blood or family connection. He\r\nhad taken her from sheer charity, and had saved her from the terrible\r\ndependency of becoming a friendless governess. Looking out to the\r\nlife which she had avoided, it seemed to her to be full of abject\r\nmisery. And he had brought her to his own house, and had made her the\r\nmistress of everything. She knew that she had been undemonstrative in\r\nher manner, and that such was her nature. But her heart welled over\r\nwith gratitude as she thought of the sweetness of the life which he\r\nhad prepared for her. Was not the question true? "What am I, that I\r\nshould stand in the way and prevent such a man as that from having\r\nwhat he wants?"\r\n\r\nAnd then she told herself that he personally was full of good gifts.\r\nHow different might it have been with her had some elderly men\r\n"wanted her," such as she had seen about in the world! How much was\r\nthere in this man that she knew that she could learn to love? And he\r\nwas one of whom she need in no wise be ashamed. He was a gentleman,\r\npleasant to look at, sweet in manner, comely and clean in appearance.\r\nWould not the world say of her how lucky she had been should it come\r\nto pass that she should become Mrs Whittlestaff? Then there were\r\nthoughts of John Gordon, and she told herself that it was a mere\r\ndream. John Gordon had gone, and she knew not where he was; and John\r\nGordon had never spoken a word to her of his love. After an hour\'s\r\ndeliberation, she thought that she would marry Mr Whittlestaff if he\r\nasked her, though she could not bring herself to say that she would\r\n"sit close up to him" in order that he might do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMARY LAWRIE ACCEPTS MR WHITTLESTAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week Mary Lawrie had changed her mind. She had\r\nthought it over, and had endeavoured to persuade herself that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff did not care about it very much. Indeed there were\r\nmoments during the week in which she flattered herself that if she\r\nwould abstain from "sitting close up to him," he would say nothing\r\nabout it. But she resolved altogether that she would not display her\r\nanger to Mrs Baggett. Mrs Baggett, after all, had done it for the\r\nbest. And there was something in Mrs Baggett\'s mode of argument on\r\nthe subject which was not altogether unflattering to Mary. It was not\r\nas though Mrs Baggett had told her that Mr Whittlestaff could make\r\nhimself quite happy with Mrs Baggett herself, if Mary Lawrie would\r\nbe good enough to go away. The suggestion had been made quite in the\r\nother way, and Mrs Baggett was prepared altogether to obliterate\r\nherself. Mary did feel that Mr Whittlestaff ought to be made a god,\r\nas long as another woman was willing to share in the worship with\r\nsuch absolute self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAt last the moment came, and the question was asked without a minute\r\nbeing allowed for consideration. It was in this wise. The two were\r\nsitting together after dinner on the lawn, and Mrs Baggett had\r\nbrought them their coffee. It was her wont to wait upon them with\r\nthis delicacy, though she did not appear either at breakfast or at\r\ndinner, except on remarkable occasions. She now had some little word\r\nto say, meant to be conciliatory and comforting, and remarked that\r\n"surely Miss Mary meant to get a colour in her cheeks at last."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be foolish, Mrs Baggett," said Mary. But Mrs Baggett\'s back\r\nwas turned, and she did not care to reply.\r\n\r\n"It is true, Mary," said Mr Whittlestaff, putting his hand on her\r\nshoulder, as he turned round to look in her face.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Lawrie used to tell me that I always blushed black, and I think\r\nthat she was about right."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what colour you blush," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"I daresay not."\r\n\r\n"But when it does come I am conscious of the sweetest colour that\r\never came upon a lady\'s cheek. And I tell myself that another grace\r\nhas been added to the face which of all faces in the world is to\r\nmy eyes the most beautiful." What was she to say in answer to a\r\ncompliment so high-flown as this, to one from whose mouth compliments\r\nwere so uncommon? She knew that he could not have so spoken without\r\na purpose, declared at any rate to his own heart. He still held her\r\nby the arm, but did not once progress with his speech, while she sat\r\nsilent by his side, and blushing with that dark ruby streak across\r\nher cheeks, which her step-mother had intended to vilify when she\r\nsaid that she had blushed black. "Mary," he continued after a pause,\r\n"can you endure the thought of becoming my wife?" Now she drew her\r\narm away, and turned her face, and compressed her lips, and sat\r\nwithout uttering a word. "Of course I am an old man."\r\n\r\n"It is not that," she muttered.\r\n\r\n"But I think that I can love you as honestly and as firmly as a\r\nyounger one. I think that if you could bring yourself to be my wife,\r\nyou would find that you would not be treated badly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, at any rate, would be kept from you. When I have a thought\r\nor a feeling, a hope or a fear, you shall share it. As to money--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that. There should be no talk of money from you to me."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not. It would be best that I should be left to do as I may\r\nthink most fitting for you. I have one incident in my life which I\r\nwould wish to tell you. I loved a girl,--many years since,--and she\r\nill-used me. I continued to love her long, but that image has passed\r\nfrom my mind." He was thinking, as he said this, of Mrs Compas and\r\nher large family. "It will not be necessary that I should refer to\r\nthis again, because the subject is very painful; but it was essential\r\nthat I should tell you. And now, Mary, how shall it be?" he added,\r\nafter a pause.\r\n\r\nShe sat listening to all that he had to say to her, but without\r\nspeaking a word. He, too, had had his "John Gordon;" but in his case\r\nthe girl he had loved had treated him badly. She, Mary, had received\r\nno bad treatment. There had been love between them, ample love, love\r\nenough to break their hearts. At least she had found it so. But there\r\nhad been no outspoken speech of love. Because of that, the wound\r\nmade, now that it had been in some sort healed, had not with her been\r\nso cruel as with Mr Whittlestaff. John Gordon had come to her on\r\nthe eve of his going, and had told her that he was about to start\r\nfor some distant land. There had been loud words between him and\r\nher step-mother, and Mrs Lawrie had told him that he was a pauper,\r\nand was doing no good about the house; and Mary had heard the words\r\nspoken. She asked him whither he was going, but he did not reply.\r\n"Your mother is right. I am at any rate doing no good here," he had\r\nsaid, but had not answered her question further. Then Mary had given\r\nhim her hand, and had whispered, "Good-bye." "If I return," he added,\r\n"the first place I will come to shall be Norwich." Then without\r\nfurther farewell ceremony he had gone. From that day to this she\r\nhad had his form before her eyes; but now, if she accepted Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, it must be banished. No one, at any rate, knew of her\r\nwound. She must tell him,--should she be moved at last to accept him.\r\nIt might be that he would reject her after such telling. If so, it\r\nwould be well. But, in that case, what would be her future? Would it\r\nnot be necessary that she should return to that idea of a governess\r\nwhich had been so distasteful to her? "Mary, can you say that it\r\nshall be so?" he asked quietly, after having remained silent for some\r\nten minutes.\r\n\r\nCould it be that all her fate must be resolved in so short a time?\r\nSince first the notion that Mr Whittlestaff had asked her to be his\r\nwife had come upon her, she had thought of it day and night. But, as\r\nis so usual with the world at large, she had thought altogether of\r\nthe past, and not of the future. The past was a valley of dreams,\r\nwhich could easily be surveyed, whereas the future was a high\r\nmountain which it would require much labour to climb. When we think\r\nthat we will make our calculations as to the future, it is so easy\r\nto revel in our memories instead. Mary had, in truth, not thought of\r\nher answer, though she had said to herself over and over again why it\r\nshould not be so.\r\n\r\n"Have you no answer to give me?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff, you have so startled me!" This was hardly\r\ntrue. He had not startled her, but had brought her to the necessity\r\nof knowing her own mind.\r\n\r\n"If you wish to think of it, you shall take your own time." Then it\r\nwas decided that a week should be accorded to her. And during that\r\nweek she passed much of her time in tears. And Mrs Baggett would\r\nnot leave her alone. To give Mrs Baggett her due, it must be\r\nacknowledged that she acted as best she knew how for her master\'s\r\ninterest, without thinking of herself. "I shall go down to\r\nPortsmouth. I\'m not worth thinking of, I ain\'t. There\'s them at\r\nPortsmouth as\'ll take care of me. You don\'t see why I should go. I\r\ndaresay not; but I am older than you, and I see what you don\'t see.\r\nI\'ve borne with you as a miss, because you\'ve not been upsetting; but\r\nstill, when I\'ve lived with him for all those years without anything\r\nof the kind, it has set me hard sometimes. As married to him, I\r\nwouldn\'t put up with you; so I tell you fairly. But that don\'t\r\nsignify. It ain\'t you as signifies or me as signifies. It\'s only him.\r\nYou have got to bring yourself to think of that. What\'s the meaning\r\nof your duty to your neighbour, and doing unto others, and all the\r\nrest of it? You ain\'t got to think just of your own self; no more\r\nhaven\'t I."\r\n\r\nMary said to herself silently that it was John Gordon of whom she\r\nhad to think. She quite recognised the truth of the lesson about\r\nselfishness; but love to her was more imperious than gratitude.\r\n\r\n"There\'s them at Portsmouth as\'ll take care of me, no doubt. Don\'t\r\nyou mind about me. I ain\'t going to have a good time at Portsmouth,\r\nbut people ain\'t born to have good times of it. You\'re going to have\r\na good time. But it ain\'t for that, but for what your duty tells you.\r\nYou that haven\'t a bit or a sup but what comes from him, and you to\r\nstand shilly-shallying! I can\'t abide the idea!"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Mrs Baggett taught her great lesson,--the greatest\r\nlesson we may say which a man or a woman can learn. And though she\r\ntaught it immoderately, fancying, as a woman, that another woman\r\nshould sacrifice everything to a man, still she taught it with truth.\r\nShe was minded to go to Portsmouth, although Portsmouth to her in the\r\npresent state of circumstances was little better than a hell upon\r\nearth. But Mary could not quite see Mr Whittlestaff\'s claim in the\r\nsame light. The one point on which it did seem to her that she had\r\nmade up her mind was Mr Gordon\'s claim, which was paramount to\r\neverything. Yes; he was gone, and might never return. It might be\r\nthat he was dead. It might be even that he had taken some other wife,\r\nand she was conscious that not a word had passed her lips that could\r\nbe taken as a promise. There had not been even a hint of a promise.\r\nBut it seemed to her that this duty of which Mrs Baggett spoke was\r\ndue rather to John Gordon than to Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\nShe counted the days,--nay, she counted the hours, till the week\r\nhad run by. And when the precise moment had come at which an answer\r\nmust be given,--for in such matters Mr Whittlestaff was very\r\nprecise,--John Gordon was still the hero of her thoughts. "Well,\r\ndear," he said, putting his hand upon her arm, just as he had done\r\non that former occasion. He said no more, but there was a world of\r\nentreaty in the tone of his voice as he uttered the words.\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff!"\r\n\r\n"Well, dear."\r\n\r\n"I do not think I can. I do not think I ought. You never heard\r\nof--Mr John Gordon."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"He used to come to our house at Norwich, and--and--I loved him."\r\n\r\n"What became of him?" he asked, in a strangely altered voice. Was\r\nthere to be a Mr Compas here too to interfere with his happiness?\r\n\r\n"He was poor, and he went away when my step-mother did not like him."\r\n\r\n"You had engaged yourself to him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! There had been nothing of that kind. You will understand\r\nthat I should not speak to you on such a subject, were it not that I\r\nam bound to tell you my whole heart. But you will never repeat what\r\nyou now hear."\r\n\r\n"There was no engagement?"\r\n\r\n"There was no question of any such thing."\r\n\r\n"And he is gone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mary; "he has gone."\r\n\r\n"And will not come back again?" Then she looked into his face,--oh!\r\nso wistfully. "When did it happen?"\r\n\r\n"When my father was on his death-bed. He had come sooner than that;\r\nbut then it was that he went. I think, Mr Whittlestaff, that I never\r\nought to marry any one after that, and therefore it is that I have\r\ntold you."\r\n\r\n"You are a good girl, Mary."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. I think that I ought to deceive you at\r\nleast in nothing."\r\n\r\n"You should deceive no one."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr Whittlestaff." She answered him ever so meekly; but there\r\nwas running in her mind a feeling that she had not deceived any one,\r\nand that she was somewhat hardly used by the advice given to her.\r\n\r\n"He has gone altogether?" he asked again.\r\n\r\n"I do not know where he is,--whether he be dead or alive."\r\n\r\n"But if he should come back?"\r\n\r\nShe only shook her head;--meaning him to understand that she could\r\nsay nothing of his purposes should he come back. He had made her\r\nno offer. He had said that if he returned he would come first to\r\nNorwich. There had been something of a promise in this; but oh, so\r\nlittle! And she did not dare to tell him that hitherto she had lived\r\nupon that little.\r\n\r\n"I do not think that you should remain single for ever on that\r\naccount. How long is it now since Mr Gordon went?"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone in which he mentioned Mr Gordon\'s\r\nname which went against the grain with Mary. She felt that he was\r\nspoken of almost as an enemy. "I think it is three years since he\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"Three years is a long time. Has he never written?"\r\n\r\n"Not to me. How should he write? There was nothing for him to write\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"It has been a fancy."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--a fancy." He had made this excuse for her, and she had none\r\nstronger to make for herself.\r\n\r\nHe certainly did not think the better of her in that she had\r\nindulged in such a fancy; but in truth his love was sharpened by\r\nthe opposition which this fancy made. It had seemed to him that\r\nhis possessing her would give a brightness to his life, and this\r\nbrightness was not altogether obscured by the idea that she had ever\r\nthought that she had loved another person. As a woman she was as\r\nlovable as before, though perhaps less admirable. At any rate he\r\nwanted her, and now she seemed to be more within his reach than she\r\nhad been. "The week has passed by, Mary, and I suppose that now you\r\ncan give me an answer." Then she found that she was in his power. She\r\nhad told him her story, as though with the understanding that if he\r\nwould take her with her "fancy," she was ready to surrender herself.\r\n"Am I not to have an answer now?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"What is it to be?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish for me, I will be yours."\r\n\r\n"And you will cease to think of Mr Gordon?"\r\n\r\n"I shall think of him; but not in a way that you would begrudge me."\r\n\r\n"That will suffice. I know that you are honest, and I will not ask\r\nyou to forget him altogether. But there had better be no speaking of\r\nhim. It is well that he should be banished from your mind. And now,\r\ndearest, dearest love, give me your hand." She put her hand at once\r\ninto his. "And a kiss." She just turned herself a little round, with\r\nher eyes bent upon the ground. "Nay; there must be a kiss." Then he\r\nbent over her, and just touched her cheek. "Mary, you are now all my\r\nown." Yes;--she was now all his own, and she would do for him the\r\nbest in her power. He had not asked for her love, and she certainly\r\nhad not given it. She knew well how impossible it would be that she\r\nshould give him her love. "I know you are disturbed," he said. "I\r\nwish also for a few minutes to think of it all." Then he turned away\r\nfrom her, and went up the garden walk by himself.\r\n\r\nShe, slowly loitering, went into the house alone, and seated herself\r\nby the open window in her bed-chamber. As she sat there she could see\r\nhim up the long walk, going and returning. As he went his hands were\r\nfolded behind his back, and she thought that he appeared older than\r\nshe had ever remarked him to be before. What did it signify? She had\r\nundertaken her business in life, and the duties she thought would be\r\nwithin her power. She was sure that she would be true to him, as far\r\nas truth to his material interests was concerned. His comforts in\r\nlife should be her first care. If he trusted her at all, he should\r\nnot become poorer by reason of his confidence. And she would be\r\nas tender to him as the circumstances would admit. She would not\r\nbegrudge him kisses if he cared for them. They were his by all the\r\nrights of contract. He certainly had the best of the bargain, but he\r\nshould never know how much the best of it he had. He had told her\r\nthat there had better be no speaking of John Gordon. There certainly\r\nshould be none on her part. She had told him that she must continue\r\nto think of him. There at any rate she had been honest. But he should\r\nnot see that she thought of him.\r\n\r\nThen she endeavoured to assure herself that this thinking would die\r\nout. Looking round the world, her small world, how many women there\r\nwere who had not married the men they had loved first! How few,\r\nperhaps, had done so! Life was not good-natured enough for smoothness\r\nsuch as that. And yet did not they, as a rule, live well with\r\ntheir husbands? What right had she to expect anything better than\r\ntheir fate? Each poor insipid dame that she saw, toddling on with\r\nhalf-a-dozen children at her heels, might have had as good a John\r\nGordon of her own as was hers. And each of them might have sat on a\r\nsummer day, at an open window, looking out with something, oh, so far\r\nfrom love, at the punctual steps of him who was to be her husband.\r\n\r\nThen her thoughts turned, would turn, could not be kept from turning,\r\nto John Gordon. He had been to her the personification of manliness.\r\nThat which he resolved to do, he did with an iron will. But his\r\nmanners to all women were soft, and to her seemed to have been\r\nsuffused with special tenderness. But he was chary of his words,--as\r\nhe had even been to her. He had been the son of a banker at Norwich;\r\nbut, just as she had become acquainted with him, the bank had broke,\r\nand he had left Oxford to come home and find himself a ruined man.\r\nBut he had never said a word to her of the family misfortune. He had\r\nbeen six feet high, with dark hair cut very short, somewhat full\r\nof sport of the roughest kind, which, however, he had abandoned\r\ninstantly. "Things have so turned out," he had once said to Mary,\r\n"that I must earn something to eat instead of riding after foxes."\r\nShe could not boast that he was handsome. "What does it signify?" she\r\nhad once said to her step-mother, who had declared him to be stiff,\r\nupsetting, and ugly. "A man is not like a poor girl, who has nothing\r\nbut the softness of her skin to depend upon." Then Mrs Lawrie had\r\ndeclared to him that "he did no good coming about the house,"--and he\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nWhy had he not spoken to her? He had said that one word, promising\r\nthat if he returned he would come to Norwich. She had lived three\r\nyears since that, and he had not come back. And her house had been\r\nbroken up, and she, though she would have been prepared to wait for\r\nanother three years,--though she would have waited till she had grown\r\ngrey with waiting,--she had now fallen into the hands of one who had\r\na right to demand from her that she should obey him. "And it is not\r\nthat I hate him," she said to herself. "I do love him. He is all\r\ngood. But I am glad that he has not bade me not to think of John\r\nGordon."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n"I SUPPOSE IT WAS A DREAM."\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her, as she sat there at the window, that she ought to\r\ntell Mrs Baggett what had occurred. There had been that between them\r\nwhich, as she thought, made it incumbent on her to let Mrs Baggett\r\nknow the result of her interview with Mr Whittlestaff. So she went\r\ndown-stairs, and found that invaluable old domestic interfering\r\nmaterially with the comfort of the two younger maidens. She was\r\ndetermined to let them "know what was what," as she expressed it.\r\n\r\n"You oughtn\'t to be angry with me, because I\'ve done nothing," said\r\nJane the housemaid, sobbing.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just about it," said Mrs Baggett. "And why haven\'t you done\r\nnothing? Do you suppose you come here to do nothing? Was it doing\r\nnothing when Eliza tied down them strawberries without putting in\r\ne\'er a drop of brandy? It drives me mortial mad to think what you\r\nyoung folks are coming to."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t a-going anywhere, Mrs Baggett, because of them strawberries\r\nbeing tied down which, if you untie them, as I always intended, will\r\nhave the sperrits put on them as well now as ever. And as for your\r\ngoing mad, Mrs Baggett, I hope it won\'t be along of me."\r\n\r\n"Drat your imperence."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t imperence at all. Here\'s Miss Lawrie, and she shall say\r\nwhether I\'m imperence."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Baggett, I want to speak to you, if you\'ll come into the other\r\nroom," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"You are imperent, both of you. I can\'t say a word but I\'m taken up\r\nthat short that--. They\'ve been and tied all the jam down, so that\r\nit\'ll all go that mouldy that nobody can touch it. And then, when I\r\nsays a word, they turns upon me." Then Mrs Baggett walked out of the\r\nkitchen into her own small parlour, which opened upon the passage\r\njust opposite the kitchen door. "They was a-going to be opened\r\nthis very afternoon," said Eliza, firing a parting shot after the\r\ndeparting enemy.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Baggett, I\'ve got to tell you," Mary began.\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"He came to me for an answer, as he said he would."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"And I told him it should be as he would have it."\r\n\r\n"Of course you would. I knew that."\r\n\r\n"You told me that it was your duty and mine to give him whatever he\r\nwanted."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say nothing of the kind, Miss."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs Baggett!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t. I said, if he wanted your head, you was to let him take\r\nit. But if he wanted mine, you wasn\'t to give it to him."\r\n\r\n"He asked me to be his wife, and I said I would."\r\n\r\n"Then I may as well pack up and be off for Portsmouth."\r\n\r\n"No; not so. I have obeyed you, and I think that in these matters you\r\nshould obey him too."\r\n\r\n"I daresay; but at my age I ain\'t so well able to obey. I daresay as\r\nthem girls knew all about it, or they wouldn\'t have turned round upon\r\nme like that. It\'s just like the likes of them. When is it to be,\r\nMiss Lawrie?--because I won\'t stop in the house after you be the\r\nmissus of it. That\'s flat. If you were to talk till you\'re deaf and\r\ndumb, I wouldn\'t do it. Oh, it don\'t matter what\'s to become of me! I\r\nknow that."\r\n\r\n"But it will matter very much."\r\n\r\n"Not a ha\'porth."\r\n\r\n"You ask him, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got his plaything. That\'s all he cares about. I\'ve been with\r\nhim and his family almost from a baby, and have grown old a-serving\r\nhim, and it don\'t matter to him whether I goes into the hedges and\r\nditches, or where I goes. They say that service is no heritance, and\r\nthey says true. I\'m to go to-- But don\'t mind me. He won\'t, and why\r\nshould you? Do you think you\'ll ever do half as much for him as I\'ve\r\ndone? He\'s got his troubles before him now;--that\'s the worst of it."\r\n\r\nThis was very bad. Mrs Baggett had been loud in laying down for her\r\nthe line of duty which she should follow, and she, to the best of her\r\nability, had done as Mrs Baggett had told her. It was the case that\r\nMrs Baggett had prevailed with her, and now the woman turned against\r\nher! Was it true that he had "his troubles before him," because of\r\nher acceptance of his offer? If so, might it not yet be mended? Was\r\nit too late? Of what comfort could she be to him, seeing that she had\r\nbeen unable to give him her heart? Why should she interfere with the\r\nwoman\'s happiness? In a spirit of true humility she endeavoured to\r\nthink how she might endeavour to do the best. Of one thing she was\r\nquite, quite sure,--that all the longings of her very soul were fixed\r\nupon that other man. He was away;--perhaps he had forgotten her;\r\nperhaps he was married. Not a word had been spoken to her on which\r\nshe could found a fair hope. But she had never been so certain of her\r\nlove,--of her love as a true, undoubted, and undoubtable fact--of\r\nan unchangeable fact,--as she was now. And why should this poor old\r\nwoman, with her many years of service, be disturbed? She went again\r\nup to her bedroom, and sitting at her open window and looking out,\r\nsaw him still pacing slowly up and down the long walk. As she looked\r\nat him, he seemed to be older than before. His hands were still\r\nclasped behind his back. There was no look about him as that of a\r\nthriving lover. Care seemed to be on his face,--nay, even present,\r\nalmost visibly, on his very shoulders. She would go to him and plead\r\nfor Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\nBut in that case what should become of herself? She was aware that\r\nshe could no longer stay in his house as his adopted daughter. But\r\nshe could go forth,--and starve if there was nothing better for her.\r\nBut as she thought of starvation, she stamped with one foot against\r\nthe other, as though to punish herself for her own falsehood. He\r\nwould not let her starve. He would get some place for her as a\r\ngoverness. And she was not in the least afraid of starvation. It\r\nwould be sweeter for her to work with any kind of hardship around\r\nher, and to be allowed to think of John Gordon with her heart free,\r\nthan to become the comfortable mistress of his house. She would not\r\nadmit the plea of starvation even to herself. She wanted to be free\r\nof him, and she would tell him so, and would tell him also of the\r\nruin he was about to bring on his old servant.\r\n\r\nShe watched him as he came back into the house, and then she rose\r\nfrom her chair. "But I shall never see him again," she said, as she\r\npaused before she left the room.\r\n\r\nBut what did that matter? Her not seeing him again ought to make,\r\nshould make, no difference with her. It was not that she might\r\nsee him, but that she might think of him with unsullied thoughts.\r\nThat should be her object,--that and the duty that she owed to Mrs\r\nBaggett. Why was not Mrs Baggett entitled to as much consideration\r\nas was she herself,--or even he? She turned to the glass, and wiped\r\nher eyes with the sponge, and brushed her hair, and then she went\r\nacross the passage to Mr Whittlestaff\'s library.\r\n\r\nShe knocked at the door,--which she had not been accustomed to\r\ndo,--and then at his bidding entered the room. "Oh, Mary," he said\r\nlaughing, "is that the way you begin, by knocking at the door?"\r\n\r\n"I think one knocks when one wants a moment of reprieve."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that you are bashful in assuming your new\r\nprivileges. Then you had better go back to your old habits, because\r\nyou always used to come where I was. You must come and go now like my\r\nvery second self." Then he came forward from the desk at which he was\r\nwont to stand and write, and essayed to put his arm round her waist.\r\nShe drew back, but still he was not startled. "It was but a cold kiss\r\nI gave you down below. You must kiss me now, you, as a wife kisses\r\nher husband."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"What!" Now he was startled.\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff, pray--pray do not be angry with me."\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of it?"\r\n\r\nThen she bethought herself,--how she might best explain the meaning.\r\nIt was hard upon her, this having to explain it, and she told\r\nherself, very foolishly, that it would be better for her to begin\r\nwith the story of Mrs Baggett. She could more easily speak of Mrs\r\nBaggett than of John Gordon. But it must be remembered, on her\r\nbehalf, that she had but a second to think how she might best begin\r\nher story. "I have spoken to Mrs Baggett about your wishes."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"She has lived with you and your family from before you were born."\r\n\r\n"She is an old fool. Who is going to hurt her? And if it did hurt\r\nher, are you and I to be put out of our course because of her? She\r\ncan remain here as long as she obeys you as her mistress."\r\n\r\n"She says that after so many years she cannot do that."\r\n\r\n"She shall leave the house this very night, if she disturbs your\r\nhappiness and mine. What! is an old woman like that to tell her\r\nmaster when he may and when he may not marry? I did not think you had\r\nbeen so soft."\r\n\r\nShe could not explain it all to him,--all that she thought upon the\r\nsubject. She could not say that the interference of any domestic\r\nbetween such a one as John Gordon and his love,--between him and her\r\nif she were happy enough to be his love,--would be an absurdity too\r\nfoolish to be considered. They, that happy two, would be following\r\nthe bent of human nature, and would speak no more than a soft word to\r\nthe old woman, if a soft word might avail anything. Their love, their\r\nhappy love, would be a thing too sacred to admit of any question\r\nfrom any servant, almost from any parent. But why, in this matter,\r\nwas not Mrs Baggett\'s happiness to be of as much consequence as Mr\r\nWhittlestaff\'s;--especially when her own peace of mind lay in the\r\nsame direction as Mrs Baggett\'s? "She says that you are only laying\r\nup trouble for yourself in this, and I think that it is true."\r\n\r\nThen he rose up in his wrath and spoke his mind freely, and showed\r\nher at once that John Gordon had not dwelt much on his mind. He had\r\nbade her not to speak of him, and then he had been contented to look\r\nupon him as one whom he would not be compelled to trouble himself\r\nwith any further. "I think, Mary, that you are making too little of\r\nme, and of yourself, to talk to me, or even to consider, in such\r\na matter, what a servant says to you. As you have given me your\r\naffection, you should now allow nothing that any one can say to you\r\nto make you even think of changing your purpose." How grossly must\r\nhe be mistaken, when he could imagine that she had given him her\r\nheart! Had she not expressly told him that her love had been set upon\r\nanother person? "To me you are everything. I have been thinking as I\r\nwalked up and down the path there, of all that I could do to make you\r\nhappy. And I was so happy myself in feeling that I had your happiness\r\nto look after. How should I not let the wind blow too coldly on you?\r\nHow should I be watchful to see that nothing should ruffle your\r\nspirits? What duties, what pleasures, what society should I provide\r\nfor you? How should I change my habits, so as to make my advanced\r\nyears fit for your younger life? And I was teaching myself to hope\r\nthat I was not yet too old to make this altogether impossible. Then\r\nyou come to me, and tell me that you must destroy all my dreams,\r\ndash all my hopes to the ground,--because an old woman has shown her\r\ntemper and her jealousy!"\r\n\r\nThis was true,--according to the light in which he saw her position.\r\nHad there been nothing between them two but a mutual desire to be\r\nmarried, the reason given by her for changing it all would be absurd.\r\nAs he had continued to speak, slowly adding on one argument to\r\nanother, with a certain amount of true eloquence, she felt that\r\nunless she could go back to John Gordon she must yield. But it was\r\nvery hard for her to go back to John Gordon. In the first place, she\r\nmust acknowledge, in doing so, that she had only put forward Mrs\r\nBaggett as a false plea. And then she must insist on her love for\r\na man who had never spoken to her of love! It was so hard that she\r\ncould not do it openly. "I had thought so little of the value I could\r\nbe to you."\r\n\r\n"Your value to me is infinite. I think, Mary, that there has come\r\nupon you a certain melancholy which is depressing you. Your regard to\r\nme is worth now more than any other possession or gift that the world\r\ncan bestow. And I had taken pride to myself in saying that it had\r\nbeen given." Yes;--her regard! She could not contradict him as to\r\nthat. "And have you thought of your own position? After all that\r\nhas passed between us, you can hardly go on living here as you have\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"I know that."\r\n\r\n"Then, what would become of you if you were to break away from me?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would get a place for me as a governess,--or a\r\ncompanion to some lady."\r\n\r\n"Would that satisfy your ambition? I have got a place for you;--but\r\nit is here." As he spoke, he laid his hand upon his heart. "Not as\r\na companion to a lady are you required to fulfil your duties here\r\non earth. It is a fuller task of work that you must do. I trust,--I\r\ntrust that it may not be more tedious." She looked at him again,\r\nand he did not now appear so old. There was a power of speech about\r\nthe man, and a dignity which made her feel that she could in truth\r\nhave loved him,--had it not been for John Gordon. "Unfortunately, I\r\nam older than you,--very much older. But to you there may be this\r\nadvantage, that you can listen to what I may say with something of\r\nconfidence in my knowledge of the world. As my wife, you will fill\r\na position more honourable, and more suitable to your gifts, than\r\ncould belong to you as a governess or a companion. You will have\r\nmuch more to do, and will be able to go nightly to your rest with a\r\nconsciousness that you have done more as the mistress of our house\r\nthan you could have done in that tamer capacity. You will have\r\ncares,--and even those will ennoble the world to you, and you to the\r\nworld. That other life is a poor shrunken death,--rather than life.\r\nIt is a way of passing her days, which must fall to the lot of many\r\na female who does not achieve the other; and it is well that they\r\nto whom it falls should be able to accommodate themselves to it\r\nwith contentment and self-respect. I think that I may say of myself\r\nthat, even as my wife, you will stand higher than you would do as a\r\ncompanion."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it."\r\n\r\n"Not on that account should you accept any man that you cannot love."\r\nHad she not told him that she did not love him;--even that she loved\r\nanother? And yet he spoke to her in this way! "You had better tell\r\nMrs Baggett to come to me."\r\n\r\n"There is the memory of that other man," she murmured very gently.\r\n\r\nThen the scowl came back upon his face;--or not a scowl, but a\r\nlook rather of cold displeasure. "If I understand you rightly, the\r\ngentleman never addressed you as a lover."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"I see it all, Mary. Mrs Baggett has been violent and selfish, and\r\nhas made you think thoughts which should not have been put in your\r\nhead to disturb you. You have dreamed a dream in your early life,--as\r\ngirls do dream, I suppose,--and it has now to be forgotten. Is it not\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was a dream."\r\n\r\n"He has passed away, and he has left you to become the happiness of\r\nmy life. Send Mrs Baggett to me, and I will speak to her." Then he\r\ncame up to her,--for they had been standing about a yard apart,--and\r\npressed his lips to hers. How was it possible that she should prevent\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nShe turned round, and slowly left the room, feeling, as she did\r\nso, that she was again engaged to him for ever and ever. She hated\r\nherself because she had been so fickle. But how could she have done\r\notherwise? She asked herself, as she went back to her room, at what\r\nperiod during the interview, which was now over, she could have\r\ndeclared to him the real state of her mind. He had, as it were, taken\r\ncomplete possession of her, by right of the deed of gift which she\r\nhad made of herself that morning. She had endeavoured to resume the\r\ngift, but had altogether failed. She declared to herself that she\r\nwas weak, impotent, purposeless; but she admitted, on the other hand,\r\nthat he had displayed more of power than she had ever guessed at\r\nhis possessing. A woman always loves this display of power in a man,\r\nand she felt that she could have loved him had it not been for John\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nBut there was one comfort for her. None knew of her weakness. Her\r\nmind had vacillated like a shuttlecock, but no one had seen the\r\nvacillation. She was in his hands, and she must simply do as he bade\r\nher. Then she went down to Mrs Baggett\'s room, and told the old\r\nlady to go up-stairs at her master\'s behest. "I\'m a-going," said Mrs\r\nBaggett. "I\'m a-going. I hope he\'ll find every one else as good at\r\ndoing what he tells \'em. But I ain\'t a-going to be a-doing for him or\r\nfor any one much longer."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Baggett walked into her master\'s room, loudly knocking at the\r\ndoor, and waiting for a loud answer. He was pacing up and down the\r\nlibrary, thinking of the injustice of her interference, and she was\r\nfull of the injury to which she had been subjected by circumstances.\r\nShe had been perfectly sincere when she had told Mary Lawrie that\r\nMr Whittlestaff was entitled to have and to enjoy his own wishes as\r\nagainst both of them. In the first place, he was a man,--and as a\r\nman, was to be indulged, at whatever cost to any number of women. And\r\nthen he was a man whose bread they had both eaten. Mary had eaten\r\nhis bread, as bestowed upon her from sheer charity. According to\r\nMrs Baggett\'s view of the world at large, Mary was bound to deliver\r\nherself body and soul to Mr Whittlestaff, were "soul sacrifice"\r\ndemanded from her. As for herself, her first duty in life was to look\r\nafter him were he to be sick. Unfortunately Mr Whittlestaff never\r\nwas sick, but Mrs Baggett was patiently looking forward to some\r\nhappy day when he might be brought home with his leg broken. He had\r\nno imprudent habits, hunting, shooting, or suchlike; but chance might\r\nbe good to her. Then the making of all jams and marmalades, for which\r\nhe did not care a straw, and which he only ate to oblige her, was a\r\ncomfort to her. She could manage occasionally to be kept out of her\r\nbed over some boiling till one o\'clock; and then the making of butter\r\nin the summer would demand that she should be up at three. Thus\r\nshe was enabled to consider that her normal hours of work were\r\ntwenty-two out of the twenty-four. She did not begrudge them in the\r\nleast, thinking that they were all due to Mr Whittlestaff. Now Mr\r\nWhittlestaff wanted a wife, and, of course, he ought to have her.\r\nHis Juggernaut\'s car must roll on its course over her body or Mary\r\nLawrie\'s. But she could not be expected to remain and behold Mary\r\nLawrie\'s triumph and Mary Lawrie\'s power. That was out of the\r\nquestion, and as she was thus driven out of the house, she was\r\nentitled to show a little of her ill humour to the proud bride. She\r\nmust go to Portsmouth;--which she knew was tantamount to a living\r\ndeath. She only hated one person in all the world, and he, as she\r\nknew well, was living at Portsmouth. There were to her only two\r\nplaces in the world in which anybody could live,--Croker\'s Hall and\r\nPortsmouth. Croker\'s Hall was on the whole the proper region set\r\napart for the habitation of the blest. Portsmouth was the other\r\nplace,--and thither she must go. To remain, even in heaven, as\r\nhousekeeper to a young woman, was not to be thought of. It was\r\nwritten in the book of Fate that she must go; but not on that account\r\nneed she even pretend to keep her temper.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this that you have been saying to Miss Lawrie?" began Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, with all the dignity of anger.\r\n\r\n"What have I been saying of to Miss Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I am not at all well pleased with you."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said a word again you, sir, nor not again nothing as you\r\nare likely to do."\r\n\r\n"Miss Lawrie is to become my wife."\r\n\r\n"So I hears her say."\r\n\r\nThere was something of a check in this--a check to Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\npride in Mary\'s conduct. Did Mrs Baggett intend him to understand\r\nthat Mary had told the whole story to the old woman, and had boasted\r\nof her promotion?\r\n\r\n"You have taught her to think that she should not do as we have\r\nproposed,--because of your wishes."\r\n\r\n"I never said nothing of the kind,--so help me. That I should put\r\nmyself up again you, sir! Oh no! I knows my place better than that. I\r\nwouldn\'t stand in the way of anything as was for your good,--or even\r\nof what you thought was good,--not to be made housekeeper to-- Well,\r\nit don\'t matter where. I couldn\'t change for the better, nor wages\r\nwouldn\'t tempt me."\r\n\r\n"What was it you said about going away?"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Baggett shook her head. "You told Miss Lawrie that you\r\nthought it was a shame that you should have to leave because of her."\r\n\r\n"I never said a word of the kind, Mr Whittlestaff; nor yet, sir, I\r\ndon\'t think as Miss Lawrie ever said so. I\'m begging your pardon for\r\ncontradicting you, and well I ought. But anything is better than\r\nmaking ill-blood between lovers." Mr Whittlestaff winced at being\r\ncalled a lover, but allowed the word to pass by. "I never said\r\nnothing about shame."\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I said as how I must leave you;--nothing but that. It ain\'t a matter\r\nof the slightest consequence to you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. I mustn\'t demean me to say as anything I had said\r\nwasn\'t rubbish when you said as it was-- But for all that, I\'ve got\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Yes, in course."\r\n\r\n"Why have you got to go?"\r\n\r\n"Because of my feelings, sir."\r\n\r\n"I never heard such trash."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, no doubt, sir. But still, if you\'ll think of it, old\r\nwomen does have feelings. Not as a young one, but still they\'re\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s going to hurt your feelings?"\r\n\r\n"In this house, sir, for the last fifteen years I\'ve been top-sawyer\r\nof the female gender."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m not to marry at all."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve gone on and you haven\'t,--that\'s all. I ain\'t a-finding no\r\nfault. But you haven\'t,--and I\'m the sufferer." Here Mrs Baggett\r\nbegan to sob, and to wipe her eyes with a clean handkerchief, which\r\nshe must surely have brought into the room for the purpose. "If you\r\nhad taken some beautiful young lady--"\r\n\r\n"I have taken a beautiful young lady," said Mr Whittlestaff, now\r\nbecoming more angry than ever.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t listen to me, sir, and then you boil over like that. No\r\ndoubt Miss Mary is as beautiful as the best on \'em. I knew how it\r\nwould be when she came among us with her streaky brown cheeks, ou\'d\r\nmake an anchor wish to kiss \'em." Here Mr Whittlestaff again became\r\nappeased, and made up his mind at once that he would tell Mary about\r\nthe anchor as soon as things were smooth between them. "But if it had\r\nbeen some beautiful young lady out of another house,--one of them\r\nfrom the Park, for instance,--who hadn\'t been here a\'most under my\r\nown thumb, I shouldn\'t \'ve minded it."\r\n\r\n"The long and the short of it is, Mrs Baggett, that I am going to be\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are, sir."\r\n\r\n"And, as it happens, the lady I have selected happens to have been\r\nyour mistress for the last two years."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t be my missus no more," said Mrs Baggett, with an air of\r\nfixed determination.\r\n\r\n"Of course you can do as you like about that. I can\'t compel any one\r\nto live in this house against her will; but I would compel you if I\r\nknew how, for your own benefit."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no compelling."\r\n\r\n"What other place have you got you can go to? I can\'t conceive it\r\npossible that you should live in any other family."\r\n\r\n"Not in no family. Wages wouldn\'t tempt me. But there\'s them as\r\nsupposes that they\'ve a claim upon me." Then the woman began to cry\r\nin earnest, and the clean pocket-handkerchief was used in a manner\r\nwhich would soon rob it of its splendour.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause before Mr Whittlestaff rejoined. "Has he\r\ncome back again?" he said, almost solemnly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s at Portsmouth now, sir." And Mrs Baggett shook her head sadly.\r\n\r\n"And wants you to go to him?"\r\n\r\n"He always wants that when he comes home. I\'ve got a bit of money,\r\nand he thinks there\'s some one to earn a morsel of bread for him--or\r\nrayther a glass of gin. I must go this time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that you need go at all; at any rate, Miss Lawrie\'s\r\nmarriage won\'t make any difference."\r\n\r\n"It do, sir," she said, sobbing.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see why."\r\n\r\n"Nor I can\'t explain. I could stay on here, and wouldn\'t be afraid of\r\nhim a bit."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you stay?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s my feelings. If I was to stay here, I could just send him my\r\nwages, and never go nigh him. But when I\'m alone about the world and\r\nforlorn, I ain\'t got no excuse but what I must go to him."\r\n\r\n"Then remain where you are, and don\'t be a fool."\r\n\r\n"But if a person is a fool, what\'s to be done then? In course I\'m\r\na fool. I knows that very well. There\'s no saying no other. But I\r\ncan\'t go on living here, if Miss Mary is to be put over my head in\r\nthat way. Baggett has sent for me, and I must go. Baggett is at\r\nPortsmouth, a-hanging on about the old shop. And he\'ll be drunk as\r\nlong as there\'s gin to be had with or without paying. They do tell\r\nme as his nose is got to be awful. There\'s a man for a poor woman\r\nto go and spend her savings on! He\'s had a\'most all on \'em already.\r\nTwenty-two pound four and sixpence he had out o\' me the last time he\r\nwas in the country. And he don\'t do nothing to have him locked up.\r\nIt would be better for me if he\'d get hisself locked up. I do think\r\nit\'s wrong, because a young girl has been once foolish and said a\r\nfew words before a parson, as she is to be the slave of a drunken\r\nred-nosed reprobate for the rest of her life. Ain\'t there to be no\r\nway out of it?"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Mrs Baggett told the tale of her married\r\nbliss,--not, however, without incurring the censure of her master\r\nbecause of her folly in resolving to go. He had just commenced a\r\nlecture on the sin of pride, in which he was prepared to show that\r\nall the evils which she could receive from the red-nosed veteran at\r\nPortsmouth would be due to her own stiff-necked obstinacy, when he\r\nwas stopped suddenly by the sound of a knock at the front door. It\r\nwas not only the knock at the door, but the entrance into the hall of\r\nsome man, for the hall-door had been open into the garden, and the\r\nservant-girl had been close at hand. The library was at the top of\r\nthe low stairs, and Mr Whittlestaff could not but hear the demand\r\nmade. The gentleman had asked whether Miss Lawrie was living there.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" said Mr Whittlestaff to the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a voice as I know, sir." The gentleman in the meantime was\r\ntaken into the drawing-room, and was closeted for the moment with\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nWe must now go down-stairs and closet ourselves for a few moments\r\nwith Mary Lawrie before the coming of the strange gentleman. She had\r\nleft the presence of Mr Whittlestaff half an hour since, and felt\r\nthat she had a second time on that day accepted him as her husband.\r\nShe had accepted him, and now she must do the best she could to suit\r\nher life to his requirements. Her first feeling, when she found\r\nherself alone, was one of intense disgust at her own weakness. He had\r\nspoken to her of her ambition; and he had told her that he had found\r\na place for her, in which that ambition might find a fair scope. And\r\nhe had told her also that in reference to John Gordon she had dreamed\r\na dream. It might be so, but to her thinking the continued dreaming\r\nof that dream would satisfy her ambition better than the performance\r\nof those duties which he had arranged for her. She had her own ideas\r\nof what was due from a girl and to a girl, and to her thinking her\r\nlove for John Gordon was all the world to her. She should not have\r\nbeen made to abandon her thoughts, even though the man had not spoken\r\na word to her. She knew that she loved him; even though a time might\r\ncome when she should cease to do so, that time had not come yet. She\r\nvacillated in her mind between condemnation of the cruelty of Mr\r\nWhittlestaff and of her own weakness. And then, too, there was some\r\nfeeling of the hardship inflicted upon her by John Gordon. He had\r\ncertainly said that which had justified her in believing that she\r\npossessed his heart. But yet there had been no word on which she\r\ncould fall back and regard it as a promise.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be better for her that she should marry Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. All her friends would think it to be infinitely better.\r\nCould there be anything more moonstruck, more shandy, more wretchedly\r\nlistless, than for a girl, a penniless girl, to indulge in dreams of\r\nan impossible lover, when such a tower of strength presented itself\r\nto her as was Mr Whittlestaff? She had consented to eat his bread,\r\nand all her friends had declared how lucky she had been to find a\r\nman so willing and so able to maintain her. And now this man did\r\nundoubtedly love her very dearly, and there would be, as she was well\r\naware, no peril in marrying him. Was she to refuse him because of a\r\nsoft word once spoken to her by a young man who had since disappeared\r\naltogether from her knowledge? And she had already accepted him,--had\r\ntwice accepted him on that very day! And there was no longer a hope\r\nfor escape, even if escape were desirable. What a fool must she be to\r\nsit there, still dreaming her impossible dream, instead of thinking\r\nof his happiness, and preparing herself for his wants! He had told\r\nher that she might be allowed to think of John Gordon, though not to\r\nspeak of him. She would neither speak of him nor think of him. She\r\nknew herself, she said, too well to give herself such liberty. He\r\nshould be to her as though he had never been. She would force herself\r\nto forget him, if forgetting lies in the absence of all thought.\r\nIt was no more than Mr Whittlestaff had a right to demand, and no\r\nmore than she ought to be able to accomplish. Was she such a weak\r\nsimpleton as to be unable to keep her mind from running back to the\r\nwords and to the visage, and to every little personal trick of one\r\nwho could never be anything to her? "He has gone for ever!" she\r\nexclaimed, rising up from her chair. "He shall be gone; I will not be\r\na martyr and a slave to my own memory. The thing came, and has gone,\r\nand there is an end of it." Then Jane opened the door, with a little\r\npiece of whispered information. "Please, Miss, a Mr Gordon wishes to\r\nsee you." The door was opened a little wider, and John Gordon stood\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nThere he was, with his short black hair, his bright pleasant eyes,\r\nhis masterful mouth, his dark complexion, and broad, handsome, manly\r\nshoulders, such as had dwelt in her memory every day since he had\r\ndeparted. There was nothing changed, except that his raiment was\r\nsomewhat brighter, and that there was a look of prosperity about him\r\nwhich he had lacked when he left her. He was the same John Gordon\r\nwho had seemed to her to be entitled to all that he wanted, and who\r\ncertainly would have had from her all that he had cared to demand.\r\nWhen he had appeared before her, she had jumped up, ready to rush\r\ninto his arms; but then she had repressed herself, and had fallen\r\nback, and she leant against the table for support.\r\n\r\n"So I have found you here," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am here."\r\n\r\n"I have been after you down to Norwich, and have heard it all. Mary,\r\nI am here on purpose to seek you. Your father and Mrs Lawrie are\r\nboth gone. He was going when I left you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr Gordon. They are both gone, and I am alone,--but for the\r\nkindness of a most generous friend."\r\n\r\n"I had heard, of course, of Mr Whittlestaff. I hope I shall not be\r\ntold now that I am doing no good about the house. At any rate I am\r\nnot a pauper. I have mended that little fault." Then he looked at\r\nher as though he thought that there was nothing for him but to begin\r\nthe conversation where it had been so roughly ended at their last\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nDid it not occur to him that something might have come across her\r\nlife during a period of nearly three years, which would stand in his\r\nway and in hers? But as she gazed into his face, it seemed as though\r\nno such idea had fallen upon him. But during those two or three\r\nminutes, a multitude of thoughts crowded on poor Mary\'s mind. Was it\r\npossible that because of the coming of John Gordon, Mr Whittlestaff\r\nshould withdraw his claim, and allow this happy young hero to walk\r\noff with the reward which he still seemed to desire? She felt sure\r\nthat it could not be so. Even during that short space of time, she\r\nresolved that it could not be so. She knew Mr Whittlestaff too well,\r\nand was sure that her lover had arrived too late. It all passed\r\nthrough her brain, and she was sure that no change could be effected\r\nin her destiny. Had he come yesterday, indeed? But before she could\r\nprepare an answer for John Gordon, Mr Whittlestaff entered the room.\r\n\r\nShe was bound to say something, though she was little able at\r\nthe moment to speak at all. She was aware that some ceremony was\r\nnecessary. She was but ill able to introduce these two men to each\r\nother, but it had to be done. "Mr Whittlestaff," she said, "this is\r\nMr John Gordon who used to know us at Norwich."\r\n\r\n"Mr John Gordon," said Mr Whittlestaff, bowing very stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; that is my name. I never had the pleasure of meeting you\r\nat Norwich, though I often heard of you there. And since I left the\r\nplace I have been told how kind a friend you have been to this young\r\nlady. I trust I may live to thank you for it more warmly though not\r\nmore sincerely than I can do at this moment."\r\n\r\nOf John Gordon\'s fate since he had left Norwich a few words must be\r\ntold. As Mrs Lawrie had then told him, he was little better than a\r\npauper. He had, however, collected together what means he had been\r\nable to gather, and had gone to Cape Town in South Africa. Thence he\r\nhad made his way up to Kimberley, and had there been at work among\r\nthe diamond-fields for two years. If there be a place on God\'s earth\r\nin which a man can thoroughly make or mar himself within that space\r\nof time, it is the town of Kimberley. I know no spot more odious\r\nin every way to a man who has learned to love the ordinary modes\r\nof English life. It is foul with dust and flies; it reeks with bad\r\nbrandy; it is fed upon potted meats; it has not a tree near it. It is\r\ninhabited in part by tribes of South African niggers, who have lost\r\nall the picturesqueness of niggerdom in working for the white man\'s\r\nwages. The white man himself is insolent, ill-dressed, and ugly.\r\nThe weather is very hot, and from morning till night there is no\r\noccupation other than that of looking for diamonds, and the works\r\nattending it. Diamond-grubbers want food and brandy, and lawyers and\r\npolicemen. They want clothes also, and a few horses; and some kind of\r\neducation is necessary for their children. But diamond-searching is\r\nthe occupation of the place; and if a man be sharp and clever, and\r\nable to guard what he gets, he will make a fortune there in two years\r\nmore readily perhaps than elsewhere. John Gordon had gone out to\r\nKimberley, and had returned the owner of many shares in many mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORDON AND MR WHITTLESTAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Gordon had gone out to South Africa with the settled intention of\r\ndoing something that might enable him to marry Mary Lawrie, and he\r\nhad carried his purpose through with a manly resolution. He had not\r\nfound Kimberley much to his taste, and had not made many dear friends\r\namong the settled inhabitants he had found there. But he had worked\r\non, buying and selling shares in mines, owning a quarter of an eighth\r\nthere, and half a tenth here, and then advancing till he was the\r\npossessor of many complete shares in many various adventures which\r\nwere quite intelligible to him, though to the ordinary stay-at-home\r\nEnglishman they seem to be so full of peril as not to be worth\r\npossessing. As in other mines, the profit is shared monthly, and the\r\nsystem has the advantage of thus possessing twelve quarter-days in\r\nthe year. The result is, that time is more spread out, and the man\r\nexpects to accomplish much more in twelve months than he can at home.\r\nIn two years a man may have made a fortune and lost it, and be on his\r\nway to make it again. John Gordon had suffered no reverses, and with\r\ntwenty-four quarter-days, at each of which he had received ten or\r\ntwenty per cent, he had had time to become rich. He had by no means\r\nabandoned all his shares in the diamond-mines; but having wealth\r\nat command, he had determined to carry out the first purpose for\r\nwhich he had come to South Africa. Therefore he returned to Norwich,\r\nand having there learned Mary\'s address, now found himself in her\r\npresence at Croker\'s Hall.\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff, when he heard John Gordon\'s name, was as much\r\nastonished as had been Mary herself. Here was Mary\'s lover,--the very\r\nman whom Mary had named to him. It had all occurred on this very\r\nmorning, so that even the look of her eyes and the tone of her voice,\r\nas those few words of hers had been spoken, were fresh in his memory.\r\n"He used to come to our house at Norwich,--and I loved him." Then she\r\nhad told him that this lover had been poor, and had gone away. He\r\nhad, since that, argued it out with himself, and with her too, on\r\nthe theory, though not expressed, that a lover who had gone away now\r\nnearly three years ago, and had not been heard of, and had been poor\r\nwhen he went, was of no use, and should be forgotten. "Let there\r\nbe no mention of him between us," he had intended to say, "and the\r\nmemory of him will fade away." But now on this very day he was back\r\namong them, and there was Mary hardly able to open her mouth in his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nHe had bowed twice very stiffly when Gordon had spoken of all that\r\nhe had done on Mary\'s behalf. "Arrangements have been made," he said,\r\n"which may, I trust, tend to Miss Lawrie\'s advantage. Perhaps I ought\r\nnot to say so myself, but there is no reason why I should trouble a\r\nstranger with them."\r\n\r\n"I hope I may never be considered a stranger by Miss Lawrie," said\r\nGordon, turning round to the young lady.\r\n\r\n"No, not a stranger," said Mary; "certainly not a stranger."\r\n\r\nBut this did not satisfy John Gordon, who felt that there was\r\nsomething in her manner other than he would have it. And yet even to\r\nhim it seemed to be impossible now, at this first moment, to declare\r\nhis love before this man, who had usurped the place of her guardian.\r\nIn fact he could not speak to her at all before Mr Whittlestaff. He\r\nhad hurried back from the diamond-fields, in order that he might lay\r\nall his surprisingly gotten wealth at Mary\'s feet, and now he felt\r\nhimself unable to say a word to Mary of his wealth, unless in this\r\nman\'s presence. He told himself as he had hurried home that there\r\nmight be difficulties in his way. He might find her married,--or\r\npromised in marriage. He had been sure of her love when he started.\r\nHe had been quite confident that, though no absolute promise had been\r\nmade from her to him, or from him to her, there had then been no\r\nreason for him to doubt. In spite of that, she might have married\r\nnow, or been promised in marriage. He knew that she must have been\r\npoor and left in want when her stepmother had died. She had told him\r\nof the intentions for her life, and he had answered that perhaps in\r\nthe course of events something better might come up for her. Then he\r\nhad been called a pauper, and had gone away to remedy that evil if\r\nit might be possible. He had heard while working among the diamonds\r\nthat Mr Whittlestaff had taken her to his own home. He had heard of\r\nMr Whittlestaff as the friend of her father, and nothing better he\r\nthought could have happened. But Mary might have been weak during his\r\nabsence, and have given herself up to some other man who had asked\r\nfor her hand. She was still, at heart, Mary Lawrie. So much had been\r\nmade known to him. But from the words which had fallen from her own\r\nlips, and from the statement which had fallen from Mr Whittlestaff,\r\nhe feared that it must be so. Mr Whittlestaff had said that he need\r\nnot trouble a stranger with Mary\'s affairs; and Mary, in answer\r\nto his appeal, had declared that he could not be considered as a\r\nstranger to her.\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment how he would act, and then he spoke boldly to\r\nboth of them. "I have hurried home from Kimberley, Mr Whittlestaff,\r\non purpose to find Mary Lawrie."\r\n\r\nMary, when she heard this, seated herself on the chair that was\r\nnearest to her. For any service that it might be to her, his coming\r\nwas too late. As she thought of this, her voice left her, so that she\r\ncould not speak to him.\r\n\r\n"You have found her," said Mr Whittlestaff, very sternly.\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason why I should go away again?" He had not at this\r\nmoment realised the idea that Mr Whittlestaff himself was the man to\r\nwhom Mary might be engaged. Mr Whittlestaff to his thinking had been\r\na paternal providence, a God-sent support in lieu of father, who had\r\ncome to Mary in her need. He was prepared to shower all kinds of\r\nbenefits on Mr Whittlestaff,--diamonds polished, and diamonds in the\r\nrough, diamonds pure and white, and diamonds pink-tinted,--if only\r\nMr Whittlestaff would be less stern to him. But even yet he had no\r\nfear of Mr Whittlestaff himself.\r\n\r\n"I should be most happy to welcome you here as an old friend of\r\nMary\'s," said Mr Whittlestaff, "if you will come to her wedding."\r\nMr Whittlestaff also had seen the necessity for open speech; and\r\nthough he was a man generally reticent as to his own affairs, thought\r\nit would be better to let the truth be known at once. Mary, when\r\nthe word had been spoken as to her wedding, "blushed black" as her\r\nstepmother had said of her. A dark ruby tint covered her cheeks and\r\nher forehead; but she turned away her face, and compressed her lips,\r\nand clenched her two fists close together.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lawrie\'s wedding!" said John Gordon. "Is Miss Lawrie to be\r\nmarried?" And he purposely looked at her, as though asking her the\r\nquestion. But she answered never a word.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Miss Lawrie is to be married."\r\n\r\n"It is sad tidings for me to hear," said John Gordon. "When last I\r\nsaw her I was rebuked by her step-mother because I was a pauper. It\r\nwas true. Misfortunes had come in my family, and I was not a fit\r\nperson to ask Miss Lawrie for her love. But I think she knew that I\r\nloved her. I then went off to do the best within my power to remedy\r\nthat evil. I have come back with such money as might suffice, and now\r\nI am told of Miss Lawrie\'s wedding!" This he said, again turning to\r\nher as though for an answer. But from her there came not a word.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you should be disappointed, Mr Gordon," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff; "but it is so." Then there came over John Gordon\'s\r\nface a dark frown, as though he intended evil. He was a man whose\r\ndispleasure, when he was displeased, those around him were apt to\r\nfear. But Mr Whittlestaff himself was no coward. "Have you any\r\nreason to allege why it should not be so?" John Gordon only answered\r\nby looking again at poor Mary. "I think there has been no promise\r\nmade by Miss Lawrie. I think that I understand from her that there\r\nhas been no promise on either side; and indeed no word spoken\r\nindicating such a promise." It was quite clear, at any rate, that\r\nthis guardian and his ward had fully discussed the question of any\r\npossible understanding between her and John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"No; there was none: it is true."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"It is true. I am left without an inch of ground on which to found a\r\ncomplaint. There was no word; no promise. You know the whole story\r\nonly too well. There was nothing but unlimited love,--at any rate on\r\nmy part." Mr Whittlestaff knew well that there had been love on her\r\npart also, and that the love still remained. But she had promised to\r\nget over that passion, and there could be no reason why she should\r\nnot do so, simply because the man had returned. He said he had come\r\nfrom Kimberley. Mr Whittlestaff had his own ideas about Kimberley.\r\nKimberley was to him a very rowdy place,--the last place in the world\r\nfrom which a discreet young woman might hope to get a well-conducted\r\nhusband. Under no circumstances could he think well of a husband\r\nwho presented himself as having come direct from the diamond-fields,\r\nthough he only looked stern and held his peace. "If Miss Lawrie will\r\ntell me that I may go away, I will go," said Gordon, looking again at\r\nMary; but how could Mary answer him?\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Mr Whittlestaff, "that Miss Lawrie will be very\r\nsorry that there should be any ground for a quarrel. I am quite\r\nwell aware that there was some friendship between you two. Then you\r\nwent, as you say, and though the friendship need not be broken, the\r\nintimacy was over. She had no special reason for remembering you, as\r\nyou yourself admit. She has been left to form any engagement that she\r\nmay please. Any other expectation on your part must be unreasonable.\r\nI have said that, as an old friend of Miss Lawrie\'s, I should be\r\nhappy to welcome you here to her wedding. I cannot even name a day as\r\nyet; but I trust that it may be fixed soon. You cannot say even to\r\nyourself that Miss Lawrie has treated you badly."\r\n\r\nBut he could say it to himself. And though he would not say it to\r\nMr Whittlestaff, had she been there alone, he would have said it to\r\nher. There had been no promise,--no word of promise. But he felt that\r\nthere had been that between them which should have been stronger than\r\nany promise. And with every word which came from Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\nmouth, he disliked Mr Whittlestaff more and more. He could judge\r\nfrom Mary\'s appearance that she was down-hearted, that she was\r\nunhappy, that she did not glory in her coming marriage. No girl\'s\r\nface ever told her heart\'s secret more plainly than did Mary\'s at\r\nthis moment. But Mr Whittlestaff seemed to glory in the marriage. To\r\nhim it seemed that the getting rid of John Gordon was the one thing\r\nof importance. So it was, at least, that John Gordon interpreted his\r\nmanner. But the name of the suitor had not yet been told him, and he\r\ndid not in the least suspect it. "May I ask you when it is to be?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"That is a question which the lady generally must answer," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, turning on his part also to Mary.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And who is the happy man?" said John Gordon. He expected an answer\r\nto the question also from Mary, but Mary was still unable to answer\r\nhim. "You at any rate will tell me, sir, the name of the gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I am the gentleman," said Mr Whittlestaff, holding himself somewhat\r\nmore erect as he spoke. The position, it must be acknowledged, was\r\ndifficult. He could see that this strange man, this John Gordon,\r\nlooked upon him, William Whittlestaff, to be altogether an unfit\r\nperson to take Mary Lawrie for his wife. By the tone in which he\r\nasked the question, and by the look of surprise which he put on\r\nwhen he received the answer, Gordon showed plainly that he had not\r\nexpected such a reply. "What! an old man like you to become the\r\nhusband of such a girl as Mary Lawrie! Is this the purpose for which\r\nyou have taken her into your house, and given her those good things\r\nof which you have boasted?" It was thus that Mr Whittlestaff had\r\nread the look and interpreted the speech conveyed in Gordon\'s eye.\r\nNot that Mr Whittlestaff had boasted, but it was thus that he read\r\nthe look. He knew that he had gathered himself up and assumed a\r\nspecial dignity as he made his answer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said John Gordon. And now he turned himself altogether\r\nround, and gazed with his full frowning eyes fixed upon poor Mary.\r\n\r\n"If you knew it all, you would feel that I could not help myself." It\r\nwas thus that Mary would have spoken if she could have given vent to\r\nthe thoughts within her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. It is I who think myself so happy as to have gained the\r\naffections of the young lady. She is to be my wife, and it is she\r\nherself who must name the day when she shall become so. I repeat the\r\ninvitation which I gave you before. I shall be most happy to see\r\nyou at my wedding. If, as may be the case, you shall not be in the\r\ncountry when that time comes; and if, now that you are here, you will\r\ngive Miss Lawrie and myself some token of your renewed friendship,\r\nwe shall be happy to see you if you will come at once to the house,\r\nduring such time as it may suit you to remain in the neighbourhood."\r\nConsidering the extreme difficulty of the position, Mr Whittlestaff\r\ncarried himself quite as well as might have been expected.\r\n\r\n"Under such circumstances," said Gordon, "I cannot be a guest in your\r\nhouse." Thereupon Mr Whittlestaff bowed. "But I hope that I may be\r\nallowed to speak a few words to the young lady not in your presence."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if the young lady wishes it."\r\n\r\n"I had better not," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Are you afraid of me?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid of myself. It had better not be so. Mr Whittlestaff has\r\ntold you only the truth. I am to be his wife; and in offering me\r\nhis hand, he has added much to the infinite kindnesses which he has\r\nbestowed upon me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you think so!"\r\n\r\n"I do think so. If you only knew it all, you would think so too."\r\n\r\n"How long has this engagement existed?" asked Gordon. But to this\r\nquestion Mary Lawrie could not bring herself to give an answer.\r\n\r\n"If you are not afraid of what he may say to you--?" said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"I am certainly afraid of nothing that Mr Gordon may say."\r\n\r\n"Then I would accede to his wishes. It may be painful, but it will\r\nbe better to have it over." Mr Whittlestaff, in giving this advice,\r\nhad thought much as to what the world would say of him. He had done\r\nnothing of which he was ashamed,--nor had Mary. She had given him her\r\npromise, and he was sure that she would not depart from it. It would,\r\nhe thought, be infinitely better for her, for many reasons, that she\r\nshould be married to him than to this wild young man, who had just\r\nnow returned to England from the diamond-mines, and would soon, he\r\nimagined, go back there again. But the young man had asked to see the\r\ngirl whom he was about to marry alone, and it would not suit him to\r\nbe afraid to allow her so much liberty.\r\n\r\n"I shall not hurt you, Mary," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would not hurt me."\r\n\r\n"Nor say an unkind word."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! You could do nothing unkind to me, I know. But you might\r\nspare me and yourself some pain."\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it," he said. "I cannot bring myself to go back at once\r\nafter this long voyage, instantly, as I should do, without having\r\nspoken one word to you. I have come here to England on purpose to see\r\nyou. Nothing shall induce me to abandon my intention of doing so, but\r\nyour refusal. I have received a blow,--a great blow,--and it is you\r\nwho must tell me that there is certainly no cure for the wound."\r\n\r\n"There is certainly none," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better leave you together," said Mr Whittlestaff, as\r\nhe got up and left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORDON AND MARY LAWRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door was closed, and John Gordon and Mary were alone together.\r\nShe was still seated, and he, coming forward, stood in front of her.\r\n"Mary," he said,--and he put out his right hand, as though to take\r\nhers. But she sat quite still, making no motion to give him her hand.\r\nNor did she say a word. To her her promise, her reiterated promise,\r\nto Mr Whittlestaff was binding,--not the less binding because it had\r\nonly been made on this very day. She had already acknowledged to\r\nthis other man that the promise had been made, and she had asked him\r\nto spare her this interview. He had not spared her, and it was for\r\nhim now to say, while it lasted, what there was to be said. She had\r\nsettled the matter in her own mind, and had made him understand that\r\nit was so settled. There was nothing further that she could tell him.\r\n"Mary, now that we are alone, will you not speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to say."\r\n\r\n"Should I not have come to you?"\r\n\r\n"You should not have stayed when you found that I had promised myself\r\nto another."\r\n\r\n"Is there nothing else that I may wish to say to you?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing else that you should wish to say to the wife of\r\nanother man."\r\n\r\n"You are not his wife,--not yet."\r\n\r\n"I shall be his wife, Mr Gordon. You may be sure of that. And I\r\nthink--think I can say of myself that I shall be a true wife. He\r\nhas chosen to take me; and as he has so chosen, his wishes must be\r\nrespected. He has asked you to remain here as a friend, understanding\r\nthat to be the case. But as you do not choose, you should go."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to stay, and to see you become his wife?"\r\n\r\n"I say nothing of that. It is not for me to insist on my wishes. I\r\nhave expressed one wish, and you have refused to grant it. Nothing\r\ncan pass between you and me which must not, I should say, be painful\r\nto both of us."\r\n\r\n"You would have me go then,--so that you should never hear of or see\r\nme again?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never see you, I suppose. What good would come of seeing\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"And you can bear to part with me after this fashion?"\r\n\r\n"It has to be borne. The world is full of hard things, which have to\r\nbe borne. It is not made to run smoothly altogether, either for you\r\nor for me. You must bear your cross,--and so must I."\r\n\r\n"And that is the only word I am to receive, after having struggled\r\nso hard for you, and having left all my work, and all my cares, and\r\nall my property, in order that I might come home, and catch just one\r\nglance of your eye. Can you not say a word to me, a word of kindness,\r\nthat I may carry back with me?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. If you will think of it, you ought not to ask me for a\r\nword of kindness. What does a kind word mean--a kind word coming from\r\nme to you? There was a time when I wanted a kind word, but I did not\r\nask for it. At the time it did not suit. Nor does it suit now. Put\r\nyourself in Mr Whittlestaff\'s case; would you wish the girl to whom\r\nyou were engaged to say kind words behind your back to some other\r\nman? If you heard them, would you not think that she was a traitor?\r\nHe has chosen to trust me,--against my advice, indeed; but he has\r\ntrusted me, and I know myself to be trustworthy. There shall be no\r\nkind word spoken."\r\n\r\n"Mary," said he, "when did all this happen?"\r\n\r\n"It has been happening, I suppose, from the first day that I came\r\ninto his house."\r\n\r\n"But when was it settled? When did he ask you to be his wife? Or\r\nwhen, rather, did you make him the promise?" John Gordon fancied that\r\nsince he had been at Croker\'s Hall words had been spoken, or that\r\nhe had seen signs, indicating that the engagement had not been of\r\na long date. And in every word that she had uttered to him he had\r\nheard whispered under her breath an assurance of her perfect love for\r\nhimself. He had been sure of her love when he had left the house at\r\nNorwich, in which he had been told that he had been lingering there\r\nto no good purpose; but he had never been more certain than he was at\r\nthis moment, when she coldly bade him go and depart back again to his\r\ndistant home in the diamond-fields. And now, in her mock anger and in\r\nher indignant words, with the purpose of her mind written so clearly\r\non her brow, she was to him more lovable and more beautiful than\r\never. Could it be fair to him as a man that he should lose the prize\r\nwhich was to him of such inestimable value, merely for a word of cold\r\nassent given to this old man, and given, as he thought, quite lately?\r\nHis devotion to her was certainly assured. Nothing could be more\r\nfixed, less capable of a doubt, than his love. And he, too, was\r\nsomewhat proud of himself in that he had endeavoured to entangle\r\nher by no promise till he had secured for himself and for her the\r\nmeans of maintaining her. He had gone out and he had come back\r\nwith silent hopes, with hopes which he had felt must be subject\r\nto disappointment, because he knew himself to be a reticent,\r\nself-restrained man; and because he had been aware that "the world,"\r\nas she had said, "is full of hard things which have to be borne."\r\n\r\nBut now if, as he believed, the engagement was but of recent date,\r\nthere would be a hardship in it, which even he could not bear\r\npatiently,--a hardship, the endurance of which must be intolerable\r\nto her. If it were so, the man could hardly be so close-fisted, so\r\nhard-hearted, so cruel-minded, as to hold the girl to her purpose!\r\n"When did you promise to be his wife?" he said, repeating his\r\nquestion. Now there came over Mary\'s face a look of weakness, the\r\nopposite to the strength which she had displayed when she had bade\r\nhim not ask her for a word of kindness. To her the promise was the\r\nsame, was as strong, even though it had been made but that morning,\r\nas though weeks and months had intervened. But she felt that to him\r\nthere would be an apparent weakness in the promise of her engagement,\r\nif she told him that it was made only on that morning. "When was it,\r\nMary?"\r\n\r\n"It matters nothing," she said.\r\n\r\n"But it does matter--to me."\r\n\r\nThen a sense of what was fitting told her that it was incumbent on\r\nher to tell him the truth. Sooner or later he would assuredly know,\r\nand it was well that he should know the entire truth from her lips.\r\nShe could not put up with the feeling that he should go away deceived\r\nin any degree by herself.\r\n\r\n"It was this morning," she said.\r\n\r\n"This very morning?"\r\n\r\n"It was on this morning that I gave my word to Mr Whittlestaff, and\r\npromised to become his wife."\r\n\r\n"And had I been here yesterday I should not have been too late?"\r\n\r\nHere she looked up imploringly into his face. She could not answer\r\nthat question, nor ought he to press for an answer. And the words\r\nwere no sooner out of his mouth than he felt that it was so. It was\r\nnot to her that he must address any such remonstrance as that. "This\r\nmorning!" he repeated--"only this morning!"\r\n\r\nBut he did not know, nor could she tell him, that she had pleaded her\r\nlove for him when Mr Whittlestaff had asked her. She could not tell\r\nhim of that second meeting, at which she had asked Mr Whittlestaff\r\nthat even yet he should let her go. It had seemed to her, as she had\r\nthought of it, that Mr Whittlestaff had behaved well to her, had\r\nintended to do a good thing to her, and had ignored the other man,\r\nwho had vanished, as it were, from the scene of their joint lives,\r\nbecause he had become one who ought not to be allowed to interest her\r\nany further. She had endeavoured to think of it with stern justice,\r\naccusing herself of absurd romance, and giving Mr Whittlestaff\r\ncredit for all goodness. This had been before John Gordon had\r\nappeared among them; and now she struggled hard not to be less just\r\nto Mr Whittlestaff than before, because of this accident. She knew\r\nhim well enough to be aware that he could not easily be brought to\r\nabandon the thing on which he had set his mind. It all passed through\r\nher mind as she prepared her answer for John Gordon. "It can make no\r\ndifference," she said. "A promise is a promise, though it be but an\r\nhour old."\r\n\r\n"That is to be my answer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is to be your answer. Ask yourself, and you will know that\r\nthere is no other answer that I can honestly make you."\r\n\r\n"How is your own heart in the affair?"\r\n\r\nThere she was weak, and knew as she spoke that she was weak. "It\r\nmatters not at all," she said.\r\n\r\n"It matters not at all?" he repeated after her. "I can understand\r\nthat my happiness should be nothing. If you and he were satisfied,\r\nof course it would be nothing. If you were satisfied, there would be\r\nan end to it; because if your pleasure and his work together, I must\r\nnecessarily be left out in the cold. But it is not so. I take upon\r\nmyself to say that you are not satisfied."\r\n\r\n"You will not allow me to answer for myself?"\r\n\r\n"No, not in this matter. Will you dare to tell me that you do not\r\nlove me?" She remained silent before him, and then he went on to\r\nreason with her. "You do not deny it. I hear it in your voice and\r\nsee it in your face. When we parted in Norwich, did you not love me\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"I shall answer no such question. A young woman has often to change\r\nher mind as to whom she loves, before she can settle down as one\r\nman\'s wife or another\'s."\r\n\r\n"You do not dare to be true. If I am rough with you, it is for your\r\nsake as well as my own. We are young, and, as was natural, we learnt\r\nto love each other. Then you came here and were alone in the world,\r\nand I was gone. Though there had been no word of marriage between us,\r\nI had hoped that I might be remembered in my absence. Perhaps you did\r\nremember me. I cannot think that I was ever absent from your heart;\r\nbut I was away, and you could not know how loyal I was to my thoughts\r\nof you. I am not blaming you, Mary. I can well understand that you\r\nwere eating his bread and drinking his cup, and that it appeared to\r\nyou that everything was due to him. You could not have gone on eating\r\nhis bread unless you had surrendered yourself to his wishes. You must\r\nhave gone from this, and have had no home to which to go. It is all\r\ntrue. But the pity of it, Mary; the pity of it!"\r\n\r\n"He has done the best he could by me."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so; but if done from that reason, the surrender will be the\r\neasier."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no; I know more of him than you do. No such surrender will\r\ncome easy to him. He has set his heart upon this thing, and as far as\r\nI am concerned he shall have it."\r\n\r\n"You will go to him with a lie in your mouth?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I cannot say what the words may be. If there be a\r\nlie, I will tell it."\r\n\r\n"Then you do love me still?"\r\n\r\n"You may cheat me out of my thoughts, but it will be to no good.\r\nWhether I lie or tell the truth, I will do my duty by him. There\r\nwill be no lying. To the best of my ability I will love him, and\r\nhim only. All my care shall be for him. I have resolved, and I will\r\nforce myself to love him. All his qualities are good. There is not a\r\nthought in his mind of which he need be ashamed."\r\n\r\n"Not when he will use his power to take you out of my arms."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; for I am not your property. You speak of dealing with me,\r\nas though I must necessarily belong to you if I did not belong to\r\nhim. It is not so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"It is not so. What might be the case I will not take upon myself\r\nto say,--or what might have been. I was yesterday a free woman, and\r\nmy thoughts were altogether my own. To-day I am bound to him, and\r\nwhether it be for joy or for sorrow, I will be true to him. Now, Mr\r\nGordon, I will leave you."\r\n\r\n"Half a moment," he said, standing between her and the door. "It\r\ncannot be that this should be the end of all between us. I shall go\r\nto him, and tell him what I believe to be the truth."\r\n\r\n"I cannot hinder you; but I shall tell him that what you say is\r\nfalse."\r\n\r\n"You know it to be true."\r\n\r\n"I shall tell him that it is false."\r\n\r\n"Can you bring yourself to utter a lie such as that?"\r\n\r\n"I can bring myself to say whatever may be best for him, and most\r\nconducive to his wishes." But as she said this, she was herself aware\r\nthat she had told Mr Whittlestaff only on this morning that she had\r\ngiven her heart to John Gordon, and that she would be unable to keep\r\nher thoughts from running to him. She had implored him to leave her\r\nto herself, so that the memory of her love might be spared. Then,\r\nwhen this young man had been still absent, when there was no dream\r\nof his appearing again before her, when the consequence would be\r\nthat she must go forth into the world, and earn her own bitter\r\nbread alone,--at that moment she knew that she had been true to the\r\nmemory of the man. What had occurred since, to alter her purpose\r\nso violently? Was it the presence of the man she did love, and the\r\nmaidenly instincts which forbade her to declare her passion in his\r\npresence? Or was it simply the conviction that her promise to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had been twice repeated, and could not now admit of\r\nbeing withdrawn? But in spite of her asseverations, there must have\r\nbeen present to her mind some feeling that if Mr Whittlestaff would\r\nyield to the prayer of John Gordon, all the gulf would be bridged\r\nover which yawned between herself and perfect happiness. Kimberley?\r\nYes, indeed; or anywhere else in the wide world. As he left the room,\r\nshe did now tell herself that in spite of all that she had said she\r\ncould accompany him anywhere over the world with perfect bliss. How\r\nwell had he spoken for himself, and for his love! How like a man he\r\nhad looked, when he had asked her that question, "Will you dare to\r\ntell me that you do not love me?" She had not dared; even though at\r\nthe moment she had longed to leave upon him the impression that it\r\nwas so. She had told him that she would lie to Mr Whittlestaff,--lie\r\non Mr Whittlestaff\'s own behalf. But such a lie as this she could\r\nnot tell to John Gordon. He had heard it in her voice and seen it in\r\nher face. She knew it well, and was aware that it must be so.\r\n\r\n"The pity of it," she too said to herself; "the pity of it!"\r\nIf he had but come a week sooner,--but a day sooner, before Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had spoken out his mind,--no love-tale would ever have\r\nrun smoother. In that case she would have accepted John Gordon\r\nwithout a moment\'s consideration. When he should have told her of\r\nhis distant home, of the roughness of his life, of the changes and\r\nchances to which his career must be subject, she would have assured\r\nhim, with her heart full of joy, that she would accept it all and\r\nthink her lot so happy as to admit of no complaint. Mr Whittlestaff\r\nwould then have known the condition of her heart, before he had\r\nhimself spoken a word. And as the trouble would always have been in\r\nhis own bosom, there would, so to say, have been no trouble at all.\r\nA man\'s sorrows of that kind do not commence, or at any rate are not\r\nacutely felt, while the knowledge of the matter from which they grow\r\nis confined altogether to his own bosom.\r\n\r\nBut she resolved, sitting there after John Gordon had left her, that\r\nin the circumstances as they existed, it was her duty to bear what\r\nsorrow there was to be borne. Poor John Gordon! He must bear some\r\nsorrow too, if there should be cause to him for grief. There would be\r\nloss of money, and loss of time, which would of themselves cause him\r\ngrief. Poor John Gordon! She did not blame him in that he had gone\r\naway, and not said one word to draw from her some assurance of her\r\nlove. It was the nature of the man, which in itself was good and\r\nnoble. But in this case it had surely been unfortunate. With such\r\na passion at his heart, it was rash in him to have gone across the\r\nworld to the diamond-fields without speaking a word by which they two\r\nmight have held themselves as bound together. The pity of it!\r\n\r\nBut as circumstances had gone, honour and even honesty demanded that\r\nMr Whittlestaff should not be allowed to suffer. He at least had\r\nbeen straightforward in his purpose, and had spoken as soon as he\r\nhad been assured of his own mind. Mr Whittlestaff should at any rate\r\nhave his reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE REV MONTAGU BLAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Gordon, when he left the room, went out to look for Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, but was told that he had gone into the town. Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had had his own troubles in thinking of the unlucky\r\ncoincidence of John Gordon\'s return, and had wandered forth,\r\ndetermined to leave those two together, so that they might speak to\r\neach other as they pleased. And during his walk he did come to a\r\ncertain resolution. Should a request of any kind be made to him by\r\nJohn Gordon, it should receive not the slightest attention. He was a\r\nman to whom he owed nothing, and for whose welfare he was not in the\r\nleast solicitous. "Why should I be punished and he be made happy?" It\r\nwas thus he spoke to himself. Should he encounter the degradation of\r\ndisappointment, in order that John Gordon should win the object on\r\nwhich he had set his heart? Certainly not. His own heart was much\r\ndearer to him than that of John Gordon.\r\n\r\nBut if a request should be made to him by Mary Lawrie? Alas! if it\r\nwere so, then there must be sharp misery in store for him. In the\r\nfirst place, were she to make the request, were she to tell him to\r\nhis face, she who had promised to be his wife, that this man was dear\r\nto her, how was it possible that he should go to the altar with the\r\ngirl, and there accept from her her troth? She had spoken already\r\nof a fancy which had crossed her mind respecting a man who could\r\nhave been no more than a dream to her, of whose whereabouts and\r\ncondition--nay, of his very existence--she was unaware. And she had\r\ntold him that no promise, no word of love, had passed between them.\r\n"Yes, you may think of him," he had said, meaning not to debar her\r\nfrom the use of thought, which should be open to all the world,\r\n"but let him not be spoken of." Then she had promised; and when she\r\nhad come again to withdraw her promise, she had done so with some\r\ncock-and-bull story about the old woman, which had had no weight with\r\nhim. Then he had her presence during the interview between the three\r\non which to form his judgment. As far as he could remember, as he\r\nwandered through the fields thinking of it, she had not spoken hardly\r\nabove a word during that interview. She had sat silent, apparently\r\nunhappy, but not explaining the cause of her unhappiness. It might\r\nwell be that she should be unhappy in the presence of her affianced\r\nhusband and her old lover. But now if she would tell him that she\r\nwished to be relieved from him, and to give herself to this stranger,\r\nshe should be allowed to go. But he told himself also that he would\r\ncarry his generosity no further. He was not called upon to offer to\r\nsurrender himself. The man\'s coming had been a misfortune; but let\r\nhim go, and in process of time he would be forgotten. It was thus\r\nthat Mr Whittlestaff resolved as he walked across the country, while\r\nhe left the two lovers to themselves in his own parlour.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly five o\'clock, and Mr Whittlestaff, as Gordon was\r\ntold, dined at six. He felt that he would not find the man before\r\ndinner unless he remained at the house,--and for doing so he had no\r\nexcuse. He must return in the evening, or sleep at the inn and come\r\nback the next morning. He must manage to catch the man alone, because\r\nhe was assuredly minded to use upon him all the power of eloquence\r\nwhich he had at his command. And as he thought it improbable so to\r\nfind him in the evening, he determined to postpone his task. But in\r\ndoing so he felt that he should be at a loss. The eager words were\r\nhot now within his memory, having been sharpened against the anvil of\r\nhis thoughts by his colloquy with Mary Lawrie. To-morrow they might\r\nhave cooled. His purpose might be as strong; but a man when he wishes\r\nto use burning words should use them while the words are on fire.\r\n\r\nJohn Gordon had a friend at Alresford, or rather an acquaintance, on\r\nwhom he had determined to call, unless circumstances, as they should\r\noccur at Croker\'s Hall, should make him too ecstatic in his wish for\r\nany such operation. The ecstasy certainly had not come as yet, and he\r\nwent forth therefore to call on the Reverend Mr Blake. Of Mr Blake\r\nhe only knew that he was a curate of a neighbouring parish, and that\r\nthey two had been at Oxford together. So he walked down to the inn to\r\norder his dinner, not feeling his intimacy with Mr Blake sufficient\r\nto justify him in looking for his dinner with him. A man always\r\ndines, let his sorrow be what it may. A woman contents herself with\r\ntea, and mitigates her sorrow, we must suppose, by an extra cup. John\r\nGordon ordered a roast fowl,--the safest dinner at an English country\r\ninn,--and asked his way to the curate\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe Rev Montagu Blake was curate of Little Alresford, a parish,\r\nthough hardly to be called a village, lying about three miles from\r\nthe town. The vicar was a feeble old gentleman who had gone away to\r\ndie in the Riviera, and Mr Blake had the care of souls to himself.\r\nHe was a man to whom his lines had fallen in pleasant places. There\r\nwere about 250 men, women, and children, in his parish, and not a\r\nDissenter among them. For looking after these folk he had L120 per\r\nannum, and as pretty a little parsonage as could be found in England.\r\nThere was a squire with whom he was growing in grace and friendship,\r\nwho, being the patron of the living, might probably bestow it upon\r\nhim. It was worth only L250, and was not, therefore, too valuable to\r\nbe expected. He had a modest fortune of his own, L300 a-year perhaps,\r\nand,--for the best of his luck shall be mentioned last,--he was\r\nengaged to the daughter of one of the prebendaries of Winchester, a\r\npretty bright little girl, with a further sum of L5000 belonging to\r\nherself. He was thirty years of age, in the possession of perfect\r\nhealth, and not so strict in matters of religion as to make it\r\nnecessary for him to abandon any of the innocent pleasures of this\r\nworld. He could dine out, and play cricket, and read a novel. And\r\nshould he chance, when riding his cob about the parish, or visiting\r\nsome neighbouring parish, to come across the hounds, he would not\r\nscruple to see them over a field or two. So that the Rev Montagu\r\nBlake was upon the whole a happy fellow.\r\n\r\nHe and John Gordon had been thrown together at Oxford for a short\r\ntime during the last months of their residence, and though they were\r\nmen quite unlike each other in their pursuits, circumstances had\r\nmade them intimate. It was well that Gordon should take a stroll for\r\na couple of hours before dinner, and therefore he started off for\r\nLittle Alresford. Going into the parsonage gate he was overtaken by\r\nBlake, and of course introduced himself. "Don\'t you remember Gordon\r\nat Exeter?"\r\n\r\n"John Gordon! Gracious me! Of course I do. What a good fellow you are\r\nto come and look a fellow up! Where have you come from, and where are\r\nyou going to, and what brings you to Alresford, beyond the charitable\r\nintention of dining with me? Oh, nonsense! not dine; but you will,\r\nand I can give you a bed too, and breakfast, and shall be delighted\r\nto do it for a week. Ordered your dinner? Then we\'ll unorder it. I\'ll\r\nsend the boy in and put that all right. Shall I make him bring your\r\nbag back?" Gordon, however, though he assented to the proposition as\r\nregarded dinner, made his friend understand that it was imperative\r\nthat he should be at the inn that night.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Blake, when they had settled down to wait for their\r\ndinner, "I am parson here,--a sort of a one at least. I am not only\r\ncurate, but live in expectation of higher things. Our squire here,\r\nwho owns the living, talks of giving it to me. There isn\'t a better\r\nfellow living than Mr Furnival, or his wife, or his four daughters."\r\n\r\n"Will he be as generous with one of them as with the living?"\r\n\r\n"There is no necessity, as far as I am concerned. I came here\r\nalready provided in that respect. If you\'ll remain here till\r\nSeptember, you\'ll see me a married man. One Kattie Forrester intends\r\nto condescend to become Mrs Montagu Blake. Though I say it as\r\nshouldn\'t, a sweeter human being doesn\'t live on the earth. I met her\r\nsoon after I had taken orders. But I had to wait till I had some sort\r\nof a house to put her into. Her father is a clergyman like myself, so\r\nwe are all in a boat together. She\'s got a little bit of money, and\r\nI\'ve got a little bit of money, so that we shan\'t absolutely starve.\r\nNow you know all about me; and what have you been doing yourself?"\r\n\r\nJohn Gordon thought that this friend of his had been most\r\ncommunicative. He had been told everything concerning his friend\'s\r\nlife. Had Mr Blake written a biography of himself down to the\r\npresent period, he could not have been more full or accurate in his\r\ndetails. But Gordon felt that as regarded himself he must be more\r\nreticent. "I intended to have joined my father\'s bank, but that came\r\nto grief."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did hear of some trouble in that respect."\r\n\r\n"And then I went out to the diamond-fields."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! that was a long way."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a long way,--and rather rough towards the end."\r\n\r\n"Did you do any good at the diamond-fields? I don\'t fancy that men\r\noften bring much money home with them."\r\n\r\n"I brought some."\r\n\r\n"Enough to do a fellow any good in his after life?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; enough to content me, only that a man is not easily\r\ncontented who has been among diamonds."\r\n\r\n"Crescit amor diamonds!" said the parson. "I can easily understand\r\nthat. And then, when a fellow goes back again, he is so apt to\r\nlose it all. Don\'t you expect to see your diamonds turn into\r\nslate-stones?"\r\n\r\n"Not except in the ordinary way of expenditure. I don\'t think the\r\ngnomes or the spirits will interfere with them,--though the thieves\r\nmay, if they can get a hand upon them. But my diamonds have, for the\r\nmost part, been turned into ready money, and at the present moment\r\ntake the comfortable shape of a balance at my banker\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'d leave it there,--or buy land, or railway shares. If I had\r\nrealised in that venture enough to look at, I\'d never go out to the\r\ndiamond-fields again."\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to bring an occupation of that kind to an end all at\r\nonce," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Crescit amor diamonds!" repeated the Reverend Montagu Blake, shaking\r\nhis head. "If you gave me three, I could easily imagine that I should\r\ntoss up with another fellow who had three also, double or quits, till\r\nI lost them all. But we\'ll make sure of dinner, at any rate, without\r\nany such hazardous proceeding." Then they went into the dining-room,\r\nand enjoyed themselves, without any reference having been made as yet\r\nto the business which had brought John Gordon into the neighbourhood\r\nof Alresford.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find that port wine rather good. I can\'t afford claret,\r\nbecause it takes such a lot to go far enough. To tell the truth, when\r\nI\'m alone I confine myself to whisky and water. Blake is a very good\r\nname for whisky."\r\n\r\n"Why do you make a ceremony with me?"\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s so pleasant to have an excuse for such a ceremony.\r\nIt wasn\'t you only I was thinking of when I came out just now, and\r\nuncorked the bottle. Think what it is to have a prudent mind. I had\r\nto get it myself out of the cellar, because girls can\'t understand\r\nthat wine shouldn\'t be treated in the same way as physic. By-the-by,\r\nwhat brought you into this part of the world at all?"\r\n\r\n"I came to see one Mr Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"What! old William Whittlestaff? Then, let me tell you, you have come\r\nto see as honest a fellow, and as good-hearted a Christian, as any\r\nthat I know."\r\n\r\n"You do know him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know him. I\'d like to see the man whose bond is better\r\nthan old Whittlestaff\'s. Did you hear what he did about that\r\nyoung lady who is living with him? She was the daughter of a\r\nfriend,--simply of a friend who died in pecuniary distress. Old\r\nWhittlestaff just brought her into his house, and made her his own\r\ndaughter. It isn\'t every one who will do that, you know."\r\n\r\n"Why do you call him old?" said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know. He is old."\r\n\r\n"Just turned fifty."\r\n\r\n"Fifty is old. I don\'t mean that he is a cripple or bedridden.\r\nPerhaps if he had been a married man, he\'d have looked younger. He\r\nhas got a very nice girl there with him; and if he isn\'t too old to\r\nthink of such things, he may marry her. Do you know Miss Lawrie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think she\'s nice? Only my goose is cooked, I\'d go in for\r\nher sooner than any one I see about."\r\n\r\n"Sooner than your own squire\'s four daughters?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--yes. They\'re nice girls too. But I don\'t quite fancy one out\r\nof four. And they\'d look higher than the curate."\r\n\r\n"A prebendary is as high as a squire," said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"There are prebendaries and there are squires. Our squire isn\'t a\r\nswell, though he\'s an uncommonly good fellow. If I get a wife from\r\none and a living from the other, I shall think myself very lucky.\r\nMiss Lawrie is a handsome girl, and everything that she ought to be;\r\nbut if you were to see Kattie Forrester, I think you would say that\r\nshe was A 1. I sometimes wonder whether old Whittlestaff will think\r\nof marrying."\r\n\r\nGordon sat silent, turning over one or two matters in his mind. How\r\nsupremely happy was this young parson with his Kattie Forrester and\r\nhis promised living,--in earning the proceeds of which there need\r\nbe no risk, and very little labour,--and with his bottle of port\r\nwine and comfortable house! All the world seemed to have smiled\r\nwith Montagu Blake. But with him, though there had been much\r\nsuccess, there had been none of the world\'s smiles. He was aware\r\nat this moment, or thought that he was aware, that the world would\r\nnever smile on him,--unless he should succeed in persuading Mr\r\nWhittlestaff to give up the wife whom he had chosen. Then he felt\r\ntempted to tell his own story to this young parson. They were alone\r\ntogether, and it seemed as though Providence had provided him with a\r\nfriend. And the subject of Mary Lawrie\'s intended marriage had been\r\nbrought forward in a peculiar manner. But he was by nature altogether\r\ndifferent from Mr Blake, and could not blurt out his love-story with\r\neasy indifference. "Do you know Mr Whittlestaff well?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well. I\'ve been here four years; and he\'s a near neighbour. I\r\nthink I do know him well."\r\n\r\n"Is he a sort of man likely to fall in love with such a girl as Miss\r\nLawrie, seeing that she is an inmate of his house?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said the parson, after some consideration, "if you ask me, I\r\ndon\'t think he is. He seems to have settled himself down to a certain\r\nmanner of life, and will not, I should say, be stirred from it very\r\nquickly. If you have any views in that direction, I don\'t think he\'ll\r\nbe your rival."\r\n\r\n"Is he a man to care much for a girl\'s love?"\r\n\r\n"I should say not."\r\n\r\n"But if he had once brought himself to ask her?" said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"And if she had accepted him?" suggested the other.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'d let her go very easily. He\'s a sort of dog whom\r\nyou cannot easily persuade to give up a bone. If he has set his heart\r\nupon matrimony, he will not be turned from it. Do you know anything\r\nof his intentions?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy that he is thinking of it."\r\n\r\n"And you mean that you were thinking of it, too, with the same lady."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t mean that." Then he added, after a pause, "That is\r\njust what I did not mean to say. I did not mean to talk about myself.\r\nBut since you ask me the question, I will answer it truly,--I have\r\nthought of the same lady. And my thoughts were earlier in the field\r\nthan his. I must say good-night now," he said, rising somewhat\r\nbrusquely from his chair. "I have to walk back to Alresford, and must\r\nsee Mr Whittlestaff early in the morning. According to your view of\r\nthe case I shan\'t do much with him. And if it be so, I shall be off\r\nto the diamond-fields again by the first mail."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so!"\r\n\r\n"That is to be my lot in life. I am very glad to have come across you\r\nonce again, and am delighted to find you so happy in your prospects.\r\nYou have told me everything, and I have done pretty much the same to\r\nyou. I shall disappear from Alresford, and never more be heard of.\r\nYou needn\'t talk much about me and my love; for though I shall be out\r\nof the way at Kimberley, many thousand miles from here, a man does\r\nnot care to have his name in every one\'s mouth."\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Blake. "I won\'t say a word about Miss Lawrie;--unless\r\nindeed you should be successful."\r\n\r\n"There is not the remotest possibility of that," said Gordon, as he\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether she is fond of him," said the curate to himself,\r\nwhen he resolved to go to bed instead of beginning his sermon that\r\nnight. "I shouldn\'t wonder if she is, for he is just the sort of man\r\nto make a girl fond of him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORDON AGAIN GOES TO CROKER\'S HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, when John Gordon reached the corner of the road\r\nat which stood Croker\'s Hall, he met, outside on the roadway, close\r\nto the house, a most disreputable old man with a wooden leg and a red\r\nnose. This was Mr Baggett, or Sergeant Baggett as he was generally\r\ncalled, and was now known about all Alresford to be the husband of\r\nMr Whittlestaff\'s housekeeper. For news had got abroad, and tidings\r\nwere told that Mr Baggett was about to arrive in the neighbourhood\r\nto claim his wife. Everybody knew it before the inhabitants of\r\nCroker\'s Hall. And now, since yesterday afternoon, all Croker\'s Hall\r\nknew it, as well as the rest of the world. He was standing there\r\nclose to the house, which stood a little back from the road, between\r\nnine and ten in the morning, as drunk as a lord. But I think his\r\nmanner of drunkenness was perhaps in some respects different from\r\nthat customary with lords. Though he had only one leg of the flesh,\r\nand one of wood, he did not tumble down, though he brandished in the\r\nair the stick with which he was accustomed to disport himself. A lord\r\nwould, I think, have got himself taken to bed. But the Sergeant did\r\nnot appear to have any such intention. He had come out on to the\r\nroad from the yard into which the back-door of the house opened, and\r\nseemed to John Gordon as though, having been so far expelled, he was\r\ndetermined to be driven no further,--and he was accompanied, at a\r\ndistance, by his wife. "Now, Timothy Baggett," began the unfortunate\r\nwoman, "you may just take yourself away out of that, as fast as your\r\nlegs can carry you, before the police comes to fetch you."\r\n\r\n"My legs! Whoever heared a fellow told of his legs when there was\r\none of them wooden. And as for the perlice, I shall want the perlice\r\nto fetch my wife along with me. I ain\'t a-going to stir out of this\r\nplace without Mrs B. I\'m a hold man, and wants a woman to look arter\r\nme. Come along, Mrs B." Then he made a motion as though to run after\r\nher, still brandishing the stick in his hand. But she retreated, and\r\nhe came down, seated on the pathway by the roadside, as though he had\r\nonly accomplished an intended manoeuvre. "Get me a drop o\' summat,\r\nMrs B., and I don\'t mind if I stay here half an hour longer." Then\r\nhe laughed loudly, nodding his head merrily at the bystanders,--as no\r\nlord under such circumstances certainly would have done.\r\n\r\nAll this happened just as John Gordon came up to the corner of the\r\nroad, from whence, by a pathway, turned the main entrance into Mr\r\nWhittlestaff\'s garden. He could not but see the drunken red-nosed\r\nman, and the old woman, whom he recognised as Mr Whittlestaff\'s\r\nservant, and a crowd of persons around, idlers out of Alresford,\r\nwho had followed Sergeant Baggett up to the scene of his present\r\nexploits. Croker\'s Hall was not above a mile from the town, just\r\nwhere the town was beginning to become country, and where the houses\r\nall had gardens belonging to them, and the larger houses a field\r\nor two. "Yes, sir, master is at home. If you\'ll please to ring the\r\nbell, one of the girls will come out." This was said by Mrs Baggett,\r\nadvancing almost over the body of her prostrate husband. "Drunken\r\nbrute!" she said, by way of a salute, as she passed him. He only\r\nlaughed aloud, and looked around upon the bystanders with triumph.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr Whittlestaff came down through the gate into the\r\nroad. "Oh, Mr Gordon! good morning, sir. You find us rather in\r\na disturbed condition this morning. I am sorry I did not think\r\nof asking you to come to breakfast. But perhaps, under all the\r\ncircumstances it was better not. That dreadful man has put us sadly\r\nabout. He is the unfortunate husband of my hardly less unfortunate\r\nhousekeeper."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, he is my husband,--that\'s true," said Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"I\'m wery much attached to my wife, if you knew all about it, sir;\r\nand I wants her to come home with me. Service ain\'t no inheritance;\r\nnor yet ain\'t wages, when they never amounts to more than twenty\r\npounds a-year."\r\n\r\n"It\'s thirty, you false ungrateful beast!" said Mrs Baggett. But in\r\nthe meantime Mr Whittlestaff had led the way into the garden, and\r\nJohn Gordon had followed him. Before they reached the hall-door, Mary\r\nLawrie had met them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff!" she said, "is it not annoying? that dreadful\r\nman with the wooden leg is here, and collecting a crowd round the\r\nplace. Good morning, Mr Gordon. It is the poor woman\'s ne\'er-do-well\r\nhusband. She is herself so decent and respectable, that she will be\r\ngreatly harassed. What can we do, Mr Whittlestaff? Can\'t we get a\r\npoliceman?" In this way the conversation was led away to the affairs\r\nof Sergeant and Mrs Baggett, to the ineffable distress of John\r\nGordon. When we remember the kind of speeches which Gordon intended\r\nto utter, the sort of eloquence which he desired to use, it must be\r\nadmitted that the interruption was provoking. Even if Mary would\r\nleave them together, it would be difficult to fall back upon the\r\nsubject which Gordon had at heart.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of consideration whether, when important subjects are\r\nto be brought upon the _tapis_, the ultimate result will or will not\r\ndepend much on the manner in which they are introduced. It ought\r\nnot to be the case that they shall be so prejudiced. "By-the-by, my\r\ndear fellow, now I think of it, can you lend me a couple of thousand\r\npounds for twelve months?" Would that generally be as efficacious\r\nas though the would-be borrower had introduced his request with the\r\ngeneral paraphernalia of distressing solemnities? The borrower, at\r\nany rate, feels that it would not, and postpones the moment till\r\nthe fitting solemnities can be produced. But John Gordon could not\r\npostpone his moment. He could not go on residing indefinitely at the\r\nClaimant\'s Arms till he could find a proper opportunity for assuring\r\nMr Whittlestaff that it could not be his duty to marry Mary Lawrie.\r\nHe must rush at his subject, let the result be what it might. Indeed\r\nhe had no hopes as to a favourable result. He had slept upon it, as\r\npeople say when they intend to signify that they have lain awake,\r\nand had convinced himself that all eloquence would be vain. Was it\r\nnatural that a man should give up his intended wife, simply because\r\nhe was asked? Gordon\'s present feeling was an anxious desire to\r\nbe once more on board the ship that should take him again to the\r\ndiamond-fields, so that he might be at peace, knowing then, as he\r\nwould know, that he had left Mary Lawrie behind for ever. At this\r\nmoment he almost repented that he had not left Alresford without any\r\nfarther attempt. But there he was on Mr Whittlestaff\'s ground, and\r\nthe attempt must be made, if only with the object of justifying his\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lawrie," he began, "if you would not mind leaving me and Mr\r\nWhittlestaff alone together for a few minutes, I will be obliged\r\nto you." This he said with quite sufficient solemnity, so that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff drew himself up, and looked hard and stiff, as though he\r\nwere determined to forget Sergeant Baggett and all his peccadilloes\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; certainly; but--" Mr Whittlestaff looked sternly at her,\r\nas though to bid her go at once. "You must believe nothing as coming\r\nfrom me unless it comes out of my own mouth." Then she put her hand\r\nupon his arm, as though half embracing him.\r\n\r\n"You had better leave us, perhaps," said Mr Whittlestaff. And then\r\nshe went.\r\n\r\nNow the moment had come, and John Gordon felt the difficulty. It had\r\nnot been lessened by the assurance given by Mary herself that nothing\r\nwas to be taken as having come from her unless it was known and heard\r\nto have so come. And yet he was thoroughly convinced that he was\r\naltogether loved by her, and that had he appeared on the scene but\r\na day sooner, she would have accepted him with all her heart. "Mr\r\nWhittlestaff," he said, "I want to tell you what passed yesterday\r\nbetween me and Miss Lawrie."\r\n\r\n"Is it necessary?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I think it is."\r\n\r\n"As far as I am concerned, I doubt the necessity. Miss Lawrie has\r\nsaid a word to me,--as much, I presume, as she feels to be\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that her feeling in the matter should be a guide for\r\nyou or for me. What we have both of us to do is to think what may be\r\nbest for her, and to effect that as far as may be within our power."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Mr Whittlestaff. "But it may so probably be the\r\ncase that you and I shall differ materially as to thinking what may\r\nbe best for her. As far as I understand the matter, you wish that she\r\nshould be your wife. I wish that she should be mine. I think that as\r\nmy wife she would live a happier life than she could do as yours; and\r\nas she thinks also--" Here Mr Whittlestaff paused.\r\n\r\n"But does she think so?"\r\n\r\n"You heard what she said just now."\r\n\r\n"I heard nothing as to her thoughts of living," said John Gordon "Nor\r\nin the interview which I had with her yesterday did I hear a word\r\nfall from her as to herself. We have got to form our ideas as to that\r\nfrom circumstances which shall certainly not be made to appear by her\r\nown speech. When you speak against me--"\r\n\r\n"I have not said a word against you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you imply," said Gordon, not stopping to notice Mr\r\nWhittlestaff\'s last angry tone,--"perhaps you imply that my life may\r\nbe that of a rover, and as such would not conduce to Miss Lawrie\'s\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"I have implied nothing."\r\n\r\n"To suit her wishes I would remain altogether in England. I was very\r\nlucky, and am not a man greedy of great wealth. She can remain here,\r\nand I will satisfy you that there shall be enough for our joint\r\nmaintenance."\r\n\r\n"What do I care for your maintenance, or what does she? Do you know,\r\nsir, that you are talking to me about a lady whom I intend to make my\r\nwife,--who is engaged to marry me? Goodness gracious me!"\r\n\r\n"I own, sir, that it is singular."\r\n\r\n"Very singular,--very singular indeed. I never heard of such a thing.\r\nIt seems that you knew her at Norwich."\r\n\r\n"I did know her well."\r\n\r\n"And then you went away and deserted her."\r\n\r\n"I went away, Mr Whittlestaff, because I was poor. I was told by her\r\nstep-mother that I was not wanted about the house, because I had no\r\nmeans. That was true, and as I loved her dearly, I started at once,\r\nalmost in despair, but still with something of hope,--with a shade of\r\nhope,--that I might put myself in the way of enabling her to become\r\nmy wife. I did not desert her."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then you came back and found her engaged to be my wife.\r\nYou had it from her own mouth. When a gentleman hears that, what has\r\nhe to do but to go away?"\r\n\r\n"There are circumstances here."\r\n\r\n"What does she say herself? There are no circumstances to justify\r\nyou. If you would come here as a friend, I offered to receive you. As\r\nyou had been known to her, I did not turn my back upon you. But now\r\nyour conduct is so peculiar that I cannot ask you to remain here any\r\nlonger." They were walking up and down the long walk, and now Mr\r\nWhittlestaff stood still, as though to declare his intention that the\r\ninterview should be considered as over.\r\n\r\n"I know that you wish me to go away," said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; unless you withdraw all idea of a claim to the young\r\nlady\'s hand."\r\n\r\n"But I think you should first hear what I have to say. You will not\r\nsurely have done your duty by her unless you hear me."\r\n\r\n"You can speak if you wish to speak," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"It was not till yesterday that you made your proposition to Miss\r\nLawrie."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Had I come on the previous day, and had I been able then to tell her\r\nall that I can tell her now, would it have made no difference?"\r\n\r\n"Did she say so?" asked the fortunate lover, but in a very angry\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"No; she did not say so. It was with difficulty that I forced from\r\nher an avowal that her engagement was so recent. But she did confess\r\nthat it was so. And she confessed, not in words, but in her manner,\r\nthat she had found it impossible to refuse to you the request that\r\nyou had asked."\r\n\r\n"I never heard a man assert so impudently that he was the sole owner\r\nof a lady\'s favours. Upon my word, I think that you are the vainest\r\nman whom I ever met."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so. I do not care to defend myself, but only her. Whether\r\nI am vain or not, is it not true that which I say? I put it to you,\r\nas man to man, whether you do not know that it is true? If you marry\r\nthis girl, will you not marry one whose heart belongs to me? Will\r\nyou not marry one of whom you knew two days since that her heart was\r\nmine? Will you not marry one who, if she was free this moment, would\r\ngive herself to me without a pang of remorse?"\r\n\r\n"I never heard anything like the man\'s vanity!"\r\n\r\n"But is it true? Whatever may be my vanity, or self-seeking, or\r\nunmanliness if you will, is not what I say God\'s truth? It is not\r\nabout my weaknesses, or your weaknesses, that we should speak, but\r\nabout her happiness."\r\n\r\n"Just so; I don\'t think she would be happy with you."\r\n\r\n"Then it is to save her from me that you are marrying her,--so that\r\nshe may not sink into the abyss of my unworthiness."\r\n\r\n"Partly that."\r\n\r\n"But if I had come two days since, when she would have received me\r\nwith open arms--"\r\n\r\n"You have no right to make such a statement."\r\n\r\n"I ask yourself whether it is not true? She would have received me\r\nwith open arms, and would you then have dared, as her guardian, to\r\nbid her refuse the offer made to her, when you had learned, as you\r\nwould have done, that she loved me; that I had loved her with all\r\nmy heart before I left England; that I had left it with the view of\r\nenabling myself to marry her; that I had been wonderfully successful;\r\nthat I had come back with no other hope in the world than that of\r\ngiving it all to her; that I had been able to show you my whole life,\r\nso that no girl need be afraid to become my wife--"\r\n\r\n"What do I know about your life? You may have another wife living at\r\nthis moment."\r\n\r\n"No doubt; I may be guilty of any amount of villainy, but then, as\r\nher friend, you should make inquiry. You would not break a girl\'s\r\nheart because the man to whom she is attached may possibly be a\r\nrogue. In this case you have no ground for the suspicion."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of a man who spoke of himself so grandiloquently!"\r\n\r\n"But there is ample reason why you should make inquiry. In truth, as\r\nI said before, it is her happiness and not mine nor your own that you\r\nshould look to. If she has taken your offer because you had been good\r\nto her in her desolation,--because she had found herself unable to\r\nrefuse aught to one who had treated her so well; if she had done\r\nall this, believing that I had disappeared from her knowledge, and\r\ndoubting altogether my return; if it be so--and you know that it is\r\nso--then you should hesitate before you lead her to her doom."\r\n\r\n"You heard her say that I was not to believe any of these things\r\nunless I got them from her own mouth?"\r\n\r\n"I did; and her word should go for nothing either with you or with\r\nme. She has promised, and is willing to sacrifice herself to her\r\npromise. She will sacrifice me too because of your goodness,--and\r\nbecause she is utterly unable to put a fair value upon herself. To me\r\nshe is all the world. From the first hour in which I saw her to the\r\npresent, the idea of gaining her has been everything. Put aside the\r\nwords which she just spoke, what is your belief of the state of her\r\nwishes?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you my belief of the state of her welfare."\r\n\r\n"There your own prejudice creeps in, and I might retaliate by\r\ncharging you with vanity as you have done me,--only that I think\r\nsuch vanity very natural. But it is her you should consult on such a\r\nmatter. She is not to be treated like a child. Of whom does she wish\r\nto become the wife? I boldly say that I have won her love, and that\r\nif it be so, you should not desire to take her to yourself. You have\r\nnot answered me, nor can I expect you to answer me; but look into\r\nyourself and answer it there. Think how it will be with you, when the\r\ngirl who lies upon your shoulder shall be thinking ever of some other\r\nman from whom you have robbed her. Good-bye, Mr Whittlestaff. I do\r\nnot doubt but that you will turn it all over in your thoughts." Then\r\nhe escaped by a wicket-gate into the road at the far end of the long\r\nwalk, and was no more heard of at Croker\'s Hall on that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMRS BAGGETT TRUSTS ONLY IN THE FUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff, when he was left alone in the long walk, was\r\ndisturbed by many troublesome thoughts. The knowledge that his\r\nhousekeeper was out on the road, and that her drunken disreputable\r\nhusband was playing the fool for the benefit of all the idlers that\r\nhad sauntered out from Alresford to see him, added something to his\r\ngrief. Why should not the stupid woman remain indoors, and allow him,\r\nher master, to send for the police? She had declared that she would\r\ngo with her husband, and he could not violently prevent her. This was\r\nnot much when added to the weight of his care as to Mary Lawrie, but\r\nit seemed to be the last ounce destined to break the horse\'s back, as\r\nis the proverbial fate of all last ounces.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to collect his thoughts, so as to resolve what\r\nit might be his duty to do in regard to Mary, Mrs Baggett appeared\r\nbefore him on the walk with her bonnet on her head. "What are you\r\ngoing to do, you stupid woman?"\r\n\r\n"I am a-going with he," she said, in the midst of a torrent of sobs\r\nand tears. "It\'s a dooty. They says if you does your dooty all will\r\ncome right in the end. It may be, but I don\'t see it no further than\r\ntaking him back to Portsmouth."\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you going to Portsmouth for now? And why? why now?\r\nHe\'s not more drunk than he has been before, nor yet less abominable.\r\nLet the police lock him up for the night, and send him back to\r\nPortsmouth in the morning. Why should you want to go with him now?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re going to take a missus," said Mrs Baggett, still\r\nsobbing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s more than I know; or you know; or anyone knows," and Mr\r\nWhittlestaff spoke as though he had nearly reduced himself to his\r\nhousekeeper\'s position.\r\n\r\n"Not marry her!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. If you will let me alone to manage my own affairs, it\r\nwill be best."\r\n\r\n"That man has been here interfering. You don\'t mean to say that\r\nyou\'re going to be put upon by such a savage as that, as has just\r\ncome home from South Africa. Diamonds, indeed! I\'d diamond him!\r\nI don\'t believe, not in a single diamond. They\'re all rubbish and\r\npaste. If you\'re going to give her up to that fellow, you\'re not the\r\ngentleman I take you for."\r\n\r\n"But if I don\'t marry you won\'t have to go," he said, unable to\r\nrefrain from so self-evident an argument.\r\n\r\n"Me going! What\'s me going? What\'s me or that drunken old reprobate\r\nout there to the likes of you? I\'d stay, only if it was to see that\r\nMr John Gordon isn\'t let to put his foot here in this house; and\r\nthen I\'d go. John Gordon, indeed! To come up between you and her,\r\nwhen you had settled your mind and she had settled hern! If she\r\nfavours John Gordon, I\'ll tear her best frock off her back."\r\n\r\n"How dare you speak in that way of the lady who is to be your\r\nmistress?"\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t to be my mistress. I won\'t have no mistress. When her time\r\nis come, I shall be in the poorhouse at Portsmouth, because I shan\'t\r\nbe able to earn a penny to buy gin for him." As she said this, Mrs\r\nBaggett sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re enough to drive a man mad. I don\'t know what it is you want,\r\nor you don\'t want."\r\n\r\n"I wishes to see Miss Lawrie do her dooty, and become your wife, as\r\na lady should do. You wishes it, and she ought to wish it too. Drat\r\nher! If she is going back from her word--"\r\n\r\n"She is not going back from her word. Nothing is more excellent,\r\nnothing more true, nothing more trustworthy than Miss Lawrie. You\r\nshould not allow yourself to speak of her in such language."\r\n\r\n"Is it you, then, as is going back?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. To tell the truth, Mrs Baggett, I do not know."\r\n\r\n"Then let me tell you, sir. I\'m an old woman whom you\'ve known all\r\nyour life pretty nigh, and you can trust me. Don\'t give up to none of\r\n\'em. You\'ve got her word, and keep her to it. What\'s the good o\' your\r\nfine feelings if you\'re to break your heart. You means well by her,\r\nand will make her happy. Can you say as much for him? When them\r\ndiamonds is gone, what\'s to come next? I ain\'t no trust in diamonds,\r\nnot to live out of, but only in the funds, which is reg\'lar. I\r\nwouldn\'t let her see John Gordon again,--never, till she was Mrs\r\nWhittlestaff. After that she\'ll never go astray; nor yet won\'t her\r\nthoughts."\r\n\r\n"God bless you! Mrs Baggett," he said.\r\n\r\n"She\'s one of them when she\'s your own she\'ll remain your own all\r\nout. She\'ll stand the washing. I\'m an old woman, and I knows \'em."\r\n\r\n"And yet you cannot live with such a lady as her?"\r\n\r\n"No! if she was one of them namby-pambys as\'d let an old woman keep\r\nher old place, it might do."\r\n\r\n"She shall love you always for what you said just now."\r\n\r\n"Love me! I don\'t doubt her loving me. She\'ll love me because she is\r\nloving--not that I am lovable. She\'ll want to do a\'most everything\r\nabout the house, and I shall want the same; and her wants are to\r\nstand uppermost,--that is, if she is to be Mrs Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"I do not know; I have to think about it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think about it no more; but just go in and do it. Don\'t have\r\nno more words with him nor yet with her,--nor yet with yourself. Let\r\nit come on just as though it were fixed by fate. It\'s in your own\r\nhands now, sir, and don\'t you be thinking of being too good-natured;\r\nthere ain\'t no good comes from it. A man may maunder away his mind in\r\nsoftnesses till he ain\'t worth nothing, and don\'t do no good to no\r\none. You can give her bread to eat, and clothes to wear, and can make\r\nher respectable before all men and women. What has he to say? Only\r\nthat he is twenty years younger than you. Love! Rot it! I suppose\r\nyou\'ll come in just now, sir, and see my boxes when they\'re ready to\r\nstart." So saying, she turned round sharply on the path and left him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the excellent advice which Mr Whittlestaff had received\r\nfrom his housekeeper, bidding him not have any more words even with\r\nhimself on the matter, he could not but think of all the arguments\r\nwhich John Gordon had used to him. According to Mrs Baggett, he\r\nought to content himself with knowing that he could find food and\r\nraiment and shelter for his intended wife, and also in feeling that\r\nhe had her promise, and her assurance that that promise should be\r\nrespected. There was to him a very rock in all this, upon which he\r\ncould build his house with absolute safety. And he did not believe\r\nof her that, were he so to act, she would turn round upon him with\r\nfuture tears or neglect her duty, because she was ever thinking of\r\nJohn Gordon. He knew that she would be too steadfast for all that,\r\nand that even though there might be some sorrow at her heart, it\r\nwould be well kept down, out of his sight, out of the sight of the\r\nworld at large, and would gradually sink out of her own sight too.\r\nBut if it be given to a man "to maunder away his mind in softnesses,"\r\nhe cannot live otherwise than as nature has made him. Such a man must\r\nmaunder. Mrs Baggett had understood accurately the nature of his\r\ncharacter; but had not understood that, as was his character, so must\r\nhe act. He could not alter his own self. He could not turn round upon\r\nhimself, and bid himself be other than he was. It is necessary to be\r\nstern and cruel and determined, a man shall say to himself. In this\r\nparticular emergency of my life I will be stern and cruel. General\r\ngood will come out of such a line of conduct. But unless he be stern\r\nand cruel in other matters also,--unless he has been born stern and\r\ncruel, or has so trained himself,--he cannot be stern and cruel for\r\nthat occasion only. All this Mr Whittlestaff knew of himself. As\r\nsure as he was there thinking over John Gordon and Mary Lawrie, would\r\nhe maunder away his mind in softnesses. He feared it of himself, was\r\nsure of it of himself, and hated himself because it was so.\r\n\r\nHe did acknowledge to himself the truth of the position as asserted\r\nby John Gordon. Had the man come but a day earlier, he would have\r\nbeen in time to say the first word; and then, as Mr Whittlestaff\r\nsaid to himself, there would not for him have been a chance. And in\r\nsuch case there would have been no reason, as far as Mr Whittlestaff\r\ncould see, why John Gordon should be treated other than as a happy\r\nlover. It was the one day in advance which had given him the strength\r\nof his position. But it was the one day also which had made him\r\nweak. He had thought much about Mary for some time past. He had told\r\nhimself that by her means might be procured some cure to the wound\r\nin his heart which had made his life miserable for so many years.\r\nBut had John Gordon come in time, the past misery would only have\r\nbeen prolonged, and none would have been the wiser. Even Mrs Baggett\r\nwould have held her peace, and not thrown it in his teeth that he had\r\nattempted to marry the girl and had failed. As it was, all the world\r\nof Alresford would know how it had been with him, and all the world\r\nof Alresford as they looked at him would tell themselves that this\r\nwas the man who had attempted to marry Mary Lawrie, and had failed.\r\n\r\nIt was all true,--all that John Gordon alleged on his own behalf. But\r\nthen he was able to salve his own conscience by telling himself that\r\nwhen John Gordon had run through his diamonds, there would be nothing\r\nbut poverty and distress. There was no reason for supposing that the\r\ndiamonds would be especially short-lived, or that John Gordon would\r\nprobably be a spendthrift. But diamonds as a source of income are\r\nvolatile,--not trustworthy, as were the funds to Mrs Baggett. And\r\nthen the nature of the source of income offered, enabled him to say\r\nso much as a plea to himself. Could he give the girl to a man who had\r\nnothing but diamonds with which to pay his weekly bills? He did tell\r\nhimself again and again, that Mary Lawrie should not be encouraged\r\nto put her faith in diamonds. But he felt that it was only an excuse.\r\nIn arguing the matter backwards and forwards, he could not but tell\r\nhimself that he did believe in John Gordon.\r\n\r\nAnd then an idea, a grand idea, but one very painful in its beauty,\r\ncrept into his mind. Even though these diamonds should melt away, and\r\nbecome as nothing, there was his own income, fixed and sure as the\r\npolar star, in the consolidated British three per cents. If he really\r\nloved this girl, could he not protect her from poverty, even were she\r\nmarried to a John Gordon, broken down in the article of his diamonds?\r\nIf he loved her, was he not bound, by some rule of chivalry which he\r\ncould not define even to himself, to do the best he could for her\r\nhappiness? He loved her so well that he thought that, for her sake,\r\nhe could abolish himself. Let her have his money, his house, and his\r\nhorses. Let her even have John Gordon. He could with a certain\r\nfeeling of delight imagine it all. But then he could not abolish\r\nhimself. There he would be, subject to the remarks of men. "There\r\nis he," men would say of him, "who has maundered away his mind in\r\nsoftnesses;--who in his life has loved two girls, and has, at last,\r\nbeen thrown over by both of them because he has been no better than\r\na soft maundering idiot." It would be thus that his neighbours would\r\nspeak of him in his vain effort to abolish himself.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet too late. He had not yielded an inch to this man. He\r\ncould still be stern and unbending. He felt proud of himself in that\r\nhe had been stern and unbending, as far as the man was concerned.\r\nAnd as regarded Mary, he did feel sure of her. If there was to be\r\nweakness displayed, it would be in himself. Mary would be true to her\r\npromise;--true to her faith, true to the arrangement made for her\r\nown life. She would not provoke him with arguments as to her love\r\nfor John Gordon; and, as Mrs Baggett had assured him, even in her\r\nthoughts she would not go astray. If it were but for that word, Mrs\r\nBaggett should not be allowed to leave his house.\r\n\r\nBut what as to Mary\'s love? Any such question was maunderingly soft.\r\nIt was not for him to ask it. He did believe in her altogether, and\r\nwas perfectly secure that his name and his honour were safe in her\r\nhands. And she certainly would learn to love him. "She\'ll stand\r\nthe washing," he said to himself, repeating another morsel of Mrs\r\nBaggett\'s wisdom. And thus he made up his mind that he would, on this\r\noccasion, if only on this occasion, be stern and cruel. Surely a man\r\ncould bring himself to sternness and cruelty for once in his life,\r\nwhen so much depended on it.\r\n\r\nHaving so resolved, he walked back into the house, intending to see\r\nMary Lawrie, and so to speak to her as to give her no idea of the\r\nconversation which had taken place between him and John Gordon. It\r\nwould not be necessary, he thought, that he should mention to her\r\nJohn Gordon\'s name any more. Let his marriage go on, as though there\r\nwere no such person as John Gordon. It would be easier to be stern\r\nand cruel when he could enact the character simply by silence. He\r\nwould hurry on his wedding as quickly as she would allow him, and\r\nthen the good thing--the good that was to come out of sternness and\r\ncruelty--would be achieved.\r\n\r\nHe went through from the library to knock at Mary\'s door, and in\r\ndoing so, had to pass the room in which Mrs Baggett had slept\r\ntranquilly for fifteen years. There, in the doorway, was a big trunk,\r\nand in the lock of the door was a key. A brilliant idea at once\r\noccurred to Mr Whittlestaff. He shoved the big box in with his foot,\r\nlocked the door, and put the key in his pocket. At that moment the\r\nheads of the gardener and the groom appeared up the back staircase,\r\nand after them Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mrs Baggett, the door is locked!" said the gardener.\r\n\r\n"It is, to be sure," said the groom. "Why, Mrs Baggett, you must\r\nhave the key in your own pocket!"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t got no such thing. Do you bring the box down with you."\r\n\r\n"I have got the key in my pocket," said Mr Whittlestaff, in a voice\r\nof much authority. "You may both go down. Mrs Baggett\'s box is not\r\nto be taken out of that room to-day."\r\n\r\n"Not taken out! Oh, Mr Whittlestaff! Why, the porter is here with\r\nhis barrow to take it down to the station."\r\n\r\n"Then the porter must have a shilling and go back again empty." And\r\nso he stalked on, to bid Miss Lawrie come to him in the library.\r\n\r\n"I never heard of such a go in all my life;--and he means it, too,"\r\nsaid Thornybush, the gardener.\r\n\r\n"I never quite know what he means," said Hayonotes, the groom; "but\r\nhe\'s always in earnest, whatever it is. I never see one like the\r\nmaster for being in earnest. But he\'s too deep for me in his meaning.\r\nI suppose we is only got to go back." So they retreated down the\r\nstairs, leaving Mrs Baggett weeping in the passage.\r\n\r\n"You should let a poor old woman have her box," she said, whining to\r\nher master, whom she followed to the library.\r\n\r\n"No; I won\'t! You shan\'t have your box. You\'re an old fool!"\r\n\r\n"I know I\'m an old fool;--but I ought to have my box."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t have it. You may just go down and get your dinner. When\r\nyou want to go to bed, you shall have the key."\r\n\r\n"I ought to have my box, Miss Mary. It\'s my own box. What am I to do\r\nwith Baggett? They have given him more gin out there, and he\'s as\r\ndrunk as a beast. I think I ought to have my own box. Shall I tell\r\nThornybush as he may come back? The train\'ll be gone, and then what\r\nam I to do with Baggett? He\'ll get hisself that drunk, you won\'t be\r\nable to stir him. And it is my own box, Mr Whittlestaff?"\r\n\r\nTo all which Mr Whittlestaff turned a deaf ear. She should find that\r\nthere was no maundering softness with him now. He felt within his own\r\nbosom that it behoved him to learn to become stern and cruel. He knew\r\nthat the key was in his pocket, and found that there was a certain\r\nsatisfaction in being stern and cruel. Mrs Baggett might sob her\r\nheart out after her box, and he would decline to be moved.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I do about Baggett, sir?" said the poor woman, coming back.\r\n"He\'s a lying there at the gate, and the perlice doesn\'t like to\r\ntouch him because of you, sir. He says as how if you could take him\r\ninto the stables, he\'d sleep it off among the straw. But then he\'d be\r\njust as bad after this first go, to-morrow."\r\n\r\nTo this, however, Mr Whittlestaff at once acceded. He saw a way out\r\nof the immediate difficulty. He therefore called Hayonotes to him,\r\nand succeeded in explaining his immediate meaning. Hayonotes and\r\nthe policeman between them lifted Baggett, and deposited the man in\r\nan empty stall, where he was accommodated with ample straw. And an\r\norder was given that as soon as he had come to himself, he should be\r\nprovided with something to eat.\r\n\r\n"Summat to eat!" said Mrs Baggett, in extreme disgust. "Provide him\r\nwith a lock-up and plenty of cold water!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMR BLAKE\'S GOOD NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, after lunch had been eaten, there came a ring at\r\nthe back-door, and Mr Montagu Blake was announced. There had been a\r\nlittle _contretemps_ or misadventure. It was Mr Blake\'s habit when\r\nhe called at Croker\'s Hall to ride his horse into the yard, there to\r\ngive him up to Hayonotes, and make his way in by the back entrance.\r\nOn this occasion Hayonotes had been considerably disturbed in his\r\nwork, and was discussing the sad condition of Mr Baggett with\r\nThornybush over the gate of the kitchen-garden. Consequently, Mr\r\nBlake had taken his own horse into the stable, and as he was about\r\nto lead the beast up to the stall, had been stopped and confused by\r\nSergeant Baggett\'s protruding wooden leg.\r\n\r\n"\'Alloa! what\'s up now?" said a voice, addressing Mr Blake\r\nfrom under the straw. "Do you go down, old chap, and get us\r\nthree-penn\'orth of cream o\' the valley from the Cock."\r\n\r\nThen Mr Blake had been aware that this prior visitor was not in a\r\ncondition to be of much use to him, and tied up his own horse in\r\nanother stall. But on entering the house, Mr Blake announced the\r\nfact of there being a stranger in the stables, and suggested that the\r\none-legged gentleman had been looking at somebody taking a glass of\r\ngin. Then Mrs Baggett burst out into a loud screech of agony. "The\r\nnasty drunken beast! he ought to be locked up into the darkest hole\r\nthey\'ve got in all Alresford."\r\n\r\n"But who is the gentleman?" said Mr Blake.\r\n\r\n"My husband, sir; I won\'t deny him. He is the cross as I have to\r\ncarry, and precious heavy he is. You must have heard of Sergeant\r\nBaggett;--the most drunkenest, beastliest, idlest scoundrel as ever\r\nthe Queen had in the army, and the most difficultest for a woman\r\nto put up with in the way of a husband! Let a woman be ever so\r\ndecent, he\'d drink her gowns and her petticoats, down to her very\r\nunderclothing. How would you like, sir, to have to take up with such\r\na beast as that, after living all your life as comfortable as any\r\nlady in the land? Wouldn\'t that be a come-down, Mr Blake? And then\r\nto have your box locked up, and be told that the key of your bedroom\r\ndoor is in the master\'s pocket." Thus Mrs Baggett continued to\r\nbewail her destiny.\r\n\r\nMr Blake having got rid of the old woman, and bethinking himself\r\nof the disagreeable incidents to which a gentleman with a larger\r\nestablishment than his own might be liable, made his way into the\r\nsitting-room, where he found Mary Lawrie alone; and having apologised\r\nfor the manner of his intrusion, and having said something intended\r\nto be jocose as to the legs of the warrior in the stable, at once\r\nasked a question as to John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Mr Gordon!" said Mary. "He was here this morning with Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, but I know nothing of him since."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t gone back to London?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where he has gone. He slept in Alresford last night,\r\nbut I know nothing of him since."\r\n\r\n"He sent his bag by the boy at the inn down to the railway station\r\nwhen he came up here. I found his bag there, but heard nothing of\r\nhim. They told me at the inn that he was to come up here, and I\r\nthought I should either find him here or meet him on the road."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to find him especially?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you know Mr Gordon?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I do. That is to say, he dined with me last night. We\r\nwere at Oxford together, and yesterday evening we got talking about\r\nour adventures since."\r\n\r\n"He told you that he had been at the diamond-fields?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I know all about the diamond-fields. But Mr Hall\r\nparticularly wants to see him up at the Park." (Mr Hall was the\r\nsquire with four daughters who lived at Little Alresford.) "Mr Hall\r\nsays that he knew his father many years ago, and sent me out to look\r\nfor him. I shall be wretched if he goes away without coming to Little\r\nAlresford House. He can\'t go back to London before four o\'clock,\r\nbecause there is no train. You know nothing about his movements?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all. For some years past Mr Gordon has been altogether a\r\nstranger to me." Mr Blake looked into her face, and was aware that\r\nthere was something to distress her. He at once gathered from her\r\ncountenance that Mr Whittlestaff had been like the dog that stuck\r\nto his bone, and that John Gordon was like the other dog--the\r\ndisappointed one--and had been turned out from the neighbourhood of\r\nthe kennel. "I should imagine that Mr Gordon has gone away, if not\r\nto London, then in some other direction." It was clear that the young\r\nlady intended him to understand that she could say nothing and knew\r\nnothing as to Mr Gordon\'s movements.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must go down to the station and leave word for him\r\nthere," said Mr Blake. Miss Lawrie only shook her head. "Mr Hall\r\nwill be very sorry to miss him. And then I have some special good\r\nnews to tell him."\r\n\r\n"Special good news!" Could it be that something had happened which\r\nwould induce Mr Whittlestaff to change his mind. That was the one\r\nsubject which to her, at the present moment, was capable of meaning\r\nspecially good tidings.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, Miss Lawrie; double good news, I may say. Old Mr\r\nHarbottle has gone at last at San Remo." Mary did know who Mr\r\nHarbottle was,--or had been. Mr Harbottle had been the vicar at\r\nLittle Alresford, for whose death Mr Blake was waiting, in order\r\nthat he might enter in together upon the good things of matrimony and\r\nthe living. He was a man so contented, and talked so frequently of\r\nthe good things which Fortune was to do for him, that the tidings of\r\nhis luck had reached even the ears of Mary Lawrie. "That\'s an odd\r\nway of putting it, of course," continued Mr Blake; "but then he was\r\nquite old and very asthmatic, and couldn\'t ever come back again. Of\r\ncourse I\'m very sorry for him,--in one way; but then I\'m very glad in\r\nanother. It is a good thing to have the house in my own hands, so as\r\nto begin to paint at once, ready for her coming. Her father wouldn\'t\r\nlet her be married till I had got the living, and I think he was\r\nright, because I shouldn\'t have liked to spend money in painting and\r\nsuch like on an uncertainty. As the old gentleman had to die, why\r\nshouldn\'t I tell the truth? Of course I am glad, though it does sound\r\nso terrible."\r\n\r\n"But what are the double good news?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t tell you. Miss Forrester is to come to the Park. She is\r\nnot coming because Mr Harbottle is dead. That\'s only a coincidence.\r\nWe are not going to be married quite at once,--straight off the reel,\r\nyou know. I shall have to go to Winchester for that. But now that old\r\nHarbottle has gone, I\'ll get the day fixed; you see if I don\'t. But I\r\nmust really be off, Miss Lawrie. Mr Hall will be terribly vexed if I\r\ndon\'t find Gordon, and there\'s no knowing where he may go whilst I\'m\r\ntalking here." Then he made his adieux, but returned before he had\r\nshut the door after him. "You couldn\'t send somebody with me, Miss\r\nLawrie? I shall be afraid of that wooden-legged man in the stables,\r\nfor fear he should get up and abuse me. He asked me to get him some\r\ngin,--which was quite unreasonable." But on being assured that he\r\nwould find the groom about the place, he went out, and the trot of\r\nhis horse was soon heard upon the road.\r\n\r\nHe did succeed in finding John Gordon, who was listlessly waiting at\r\nthe Claimant\'s Arms for the coming of the four o\'clock train which\r\nwas to take him back to London, on his way, as he told himself, to\r\nthe diamond-fields. He had thrown all his heart, all the energy of\r\nwhich he was the master, into the manner in which he had pleaded for\r\nhimself and for Mary with Mr Whittlestaff. But he felt the weakness\r\nof his position in that he could not remain present upon the ground\r\nand see the working of his words. Having said what he had to say, he\r\ncould only go; and it was not to be expected that the eloquence of an\r\nabsent man, of one who had declared that he was about to start for\r\nSouth Africa, should be regarded. He knew that what he had said was\r\ntrue, and that, being true, it ought to prevail; but, having declared\r\nit, there was nothing for him to do but to go away. He could not see\r\nMary herself again, nor, if he did so, would she be so likely to\r\nyield to him as was Mr Whittlestaff. He could have no further excuse\r\nfor addressing himself to the girl who was about to become the wife\r\nof another man. Therefore he sat restless, idle, and miserable in the\r\nlittle parlour at the Claimant\'s Arms, thinking that the long journey\r\nwhich he had made had been taken all in vain, and that there was\r\nnothing left for him in the world but to return to Kimberley, and add\r\nmore diamonds to his stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gordon!" said Blake, bursting into the room, "you\'re the very\r\nman I want to find. You can\'t go back to London to-day."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Quite out of the question. Mr Hall knew your father intimately when\r\nyou were only a little chap."\r\n\r\n"Will that prevent my going back to London?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly it will. He wants to renew the acquaintance. He is a\r\nmost hospitable, kind-hearted man; and who knows, one of the four\r\ndaughters might do yet."\r\n\r\n"Who is Mr Hall?" No doubt he had heard the name on the previous\r\nevening; but Hall is common, and had been forgotten.\r\n\r\n"Who is Mr Hall? Why, he is the squire of Little Alresford, and my\r\npatron. I forget you haven\'t heard that Mr Harbottle is dead at\r\nlast. Of course I am very sorry for the old gentleman in one sense;\r\nbut it is such a blessing in another. I\'m only just thirty, and it\'s\r\na grand thing my tumbling into the living in this way."\r\n\r\n"I needn\'t go back because Mr Harbottle is dead."\r\n\r\n"But Kattie Forrester is coming to the Park. I told you last night,\r\nbut I daresay you\'ve forgotten it; and I couldn\'t tell then that Mr\r\nHall was acquainted with you, or that he would be so anxious to be\r\nhospitable. He says that I\'m to tell you to take your bag up to the\r\nhouse at once. There never was anything more civil than that. Of\r\ncourse I let him know that we had been at Oxford together. That does\r\ngo for something."\r\n\r\n"The university and your society together," suggested Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t chaff, because I\'m in earnest. Kattie Forrester will be in by\r\nthe very train that was to take you on to London, and I\'m to wait\r\nand put her into Mr Hall\'s carriage. One of the daughters, I don\'t\r\ndoubt, will be there, and you can wait and see her if you like it. If\r\nyou\'ll get your bag ready, the coachman will take it with Kattie\'s\r\nluggage. There\'s the Park carriage coming down the street now. I\'ll\r\ngo out and stop old Steadypace the coachman; only don\'t you keep him\r\nlong, because I shouldn\'t like Kattie to find that there was no one\r\nto look after her at the station."\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be an opening in all this for John Gordon to remain\r\nat any rate a day longer in the neighbourhood of Mary Lawrie, and\r\nhe determined that he would avail himself of the opportunity. He\r\ntherefore, together with his friend Blake, saw the coachman, and\r\ngave instructions as to finding the bag at the station, and prepared\r\nhimself to walk out to the Park. "You can go down to the station," he\r\nsaid to Blake, "and can ride back with the carriage."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall see you up at the house," said Blake. "Indeed I\'ve\r\nbeen asked to stay there whilst Kattie is with them. Nothing can be\r\nmore hospitable than Mr Hall and his four daughters. I\'d give you\r\nsome advice, only I really don\'t know which you\'d like the best.\r\nThere is a sort of similarity about them; but that wears off when you\r\ncome to know them. I have heard people say that the two eldest are\r\nvery much alike. If that be so, perhaps you\'ll like the third the\r\nbest. The third is the nicest, as her hair may be a shade darker than\r\nthe others. I really must be off now, as I wouldn\'t for worlds that\r\nthe train should come in before I\'m on the platform." With that he\r\nwent into the yard, and at once trotted off on his cob.\r\n\r\nGordon paid his bill, and started on his walk to Little Alresford\r\nPark. Looking back into his early memories, he could just remember to\r\nhave heard his father speak of Mr Hall. But that was all. His father\r\nwas now dead, and, certainly, he thought, had not mentioned the\r\nname for many years. But the invitation was civil, and as he was to\r\nremain in the neighbourhood, it might be that he should again have an\r\nopportunity of seeing Mary Lawrie or Mr Whittlestaff. He found that\r\nLittle Alresford Park lay between the town and Mr Blake\'s church,\r\nso that he was at the gate sooner than he expected. He went in, and\r\nhaving time on his hands, deviated from the road and went up a hill,\r\nwhich was indeed one of the downs, though between the park paling.\r\nHere he saw deer feeding, and he came after a while to a beech grove.\r\nHe had now gone down the hill on the other side, and found himself\r\nclose to as pretty a labourer\'s cottage as he remembered ever to have\r\nseen. It was still June, and it was hot, and he had been on his legs\r\nnearly the whole morning. Then he began to talk, or rather to think\r\nto himself. "What a happy fellow is that man Montagu Blake! He\r\nhas every thing,--not that he wants, but that he thinks that he\r\nwants. The work of his life is merely play. He is going to marry a\r\nwife,--not who is, but whom he thinks to be perfection. He looks as\r\nthough he were never ill a day in his life. How would he do if he\r\nwere grubbing for diamonds amidst the mud and dust of Kimberley?\r\nInstead of that, he can throw himself down on such a spot as this,\r\nand meditate his sermon among the beech-trees." Then he began to\r\nthink whether the sermon could be made to have some flavour of the\r\nbeech-trees, and how much better in that case it would be, and as he\r\nso thought he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe had not been asleep very long, perhaps not five minutes, when he\r\nbecame aware in his slumbers that an old man was standing over him.\r\nOne does thus become conscious of things before the moment of waking\r\nhas arrived, so positively as to give to the sleeper a false sense of\r\nthe reality of existence. "I wonder whether you can be Mr Gordon,"\r\nsaid the old man.\r\n\r\n"But I am," said Gordon. "I wonder how you know me."\r\n\r\n"Because I expect you." There was something very mysterious\r\nin this,--which, however, lost all mystery as soon as he was\r\nsufficiently awake to think of things. "You are Mr Blake\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am Mr Blake\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"And I am Mr Hall. I didn\'t expect to find you sleeping here in Gar\r\nWood. But when I find a strange gentleman asleep in Gar Wood, I put\r\ntwo and two together, and conclude that you must be Mr Gordon."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the prettiest place in all the world, I think."\r\n\r\n"Yes; we are rather proud of Gar Wood,--especially when the deer are\r\nbrowsing on the hill-side to the left, as they are now. If you don\'t\r\nwant to go to sleep again, we\'ll walk up to the house. There\'s the\r\ncarriage. I can hear the wheels. The girls have gone down to fetch\r\nyour friend\'s bride. Mr Blake is very fond of his bride,--as I dare\r\nsay you have found out."\r\n\r\nThen, as the two walked together to the house, Mr Hall explained\r\nthat there had been some little difference in years gone by between\r\nold Mr Gordon and himself as to money. "I was very sorry, but I had\r\nto look after myself. You knew nothing about it, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"I have heard your name--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I need not say anything more about it," said Mr Hall; "only when\r\nI heard that you were in the country, I was very glad to have the\r\nopportunity of seeing you. Blake tells me that you know my friend\r\nWhittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"I did not know him till yesterday morning."\r\n\r\n"Then you know the young lady there; a charming young lady she is. My\r\ngirls are extremely fond of Mary Lawrie. I hope we may get them to\r\ncome over while you are staying here."\r\n\r\n"I can only remain one night,--or at the most two, Mr Hall."\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh! We have other places in the neighbourhood to show you\r\nquite as pretty as Gar Wood. Though that\'s a bounce: I don\'t think\r\nthere is any morsel quite so choice as Gar Wood when the deer are\r\nthere. What an eye you must have, Mr Gordon, to have made it out by\r\nyourself at once; but then, after all, it only put you to sleep. I\r\nwonder whether the Rookery will put you to sleep. We go in this way,\r\nso as to escape the formality of the front door, and I\'ll introduce\r\nyou to my daughters and Miss Forrester."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAT LITTLE ALRESFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Hall was a pleasant English gentleman, now verging upon seventy\r\nyears of age, who had "never had a headache in his life," as he was\r\nwont to boast, but who lived very carefully, as one who did not\r\nintend to have many headaches. He certainly did not intend to make\r\nhis head ache by the cares of the work of the world. He was very well\r\noff;--that is to say, that with so many thousands a year, he managed\r\nto live upon half. This he had done for very many years, because\r\nthe estate was entailed on a distant relative, and because he had\r\nnot chosen to leave his children paupers. When the girls came he\r\nimmediately resolved that he would never go up to London,--and kept\r\nhis resolve. Not above once in three or four years was it supposed to\r\nbe necessary that he showed his head to a London hairdresser. He was\r\nquite content to have a practitioner out from Alresford, and to pay\r\nhim one shilling, including the journey. His tenants in these bad\r\ntimes had always paid their rents, but they had done so because\r\ntheir rents had not been raised since the squire had come to the\r\nthrone. Mr Hall knew well that if he was anxious to save himself from\r\nheadaches in that line, he had better let his lands on easy terms. He\r\nwas very hospitable, but he never gave turtle from London, or fish\r\nfrom Southampton, or strawberries or peas on the first of April. He\r\ncould give a dinner without champagne, and thought forty shillings\r\na dozen price enough for port or sherry, or even claret. He kept a\r\ncarriage for his four daughters, and did not tell all the world that\r\nthe horses spent a fair proportion of their time at the plough. The\r\nfour daughters had two saddle-horses between them, and the father had\r\nanother for his own use. He did not hunt,--and living in that part\r\nof Hampshire, I think he was right. He did shoot after the manner\r\nof our forefathers;--would go out, for instance, with Mr Blake, and\r\nperhaps Mr Whittlestaff, and would bring home three pheasants, four\r\npartridges, a hare, and any quantity of rabbits that the cook might\r\nhave ordered. He was a man determined on no account to live beyond\r\nhis means; and was not very anxious to seem to be rich. He was a man\r\nof no strong affections, or peculiarly generous feelings. Those who\r\nknew him, and did not like him, said that he was selfish. They who\r\nwere partial to him declared that he never owed a shilling that he\r\ncould not pay, and that his daughters were very happy in having such\r\na father. He was a good-looking man, with well-formed features, but\r\none whom you had to see often before you could remember him. And as\r\nI have said before, he "never had a headache in his life." "When\r\nyour father wasn\'t doing quite so well with the bank as his friends\r\nwished, he asked me to do something for him. Well; I didn\'t see my\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I was a boy then, and I heard nothing of my father\'s business."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not; but I cannot help telling you. He thought I\r\nwas unkind. I thought that he would go on from one trouble to\r\nanother;--and he did. He quarrelled with me, and for years we\r\nnever spoke. Indeed I never saw him again. But for the sake of old\r\nfriendship, I am very glad to meet you." This he said, as he was\r\nwalking across the hall to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThere Gordon met the young ladies with the clergyman, and had to\r\nundergo the necessary introductions. He thought that he could\r\nperceive at once that his story, as it regarded Mary Lawrie, had\r\nbeen told to all of them. Gordon was quick, and could learn from the\r\nmanners of his companions what had been said about him, and could\r\nperceive that they were aware of something of his story. Blake had no\r\nsuch quickness, and could attribute none of it to another. "I am very\r\nproud to have the pleasure of making you acquainted with these five\r\nyoung ladies." As he said this he had just paused in his narrative\r\nof Mr Whittlestaff\'s love, and was certain that he had changed the\r\nconversation with great effect. But the young ladies were unable not\r\nto look as young ladies would have looked when hearing the story of\r\nan unfortunate gentleman\'s love. And Mr Blake would certainly have\r\nbeen unable to keep such a secret.\r\n\r\n"This is Miss Hall, and this is Miss Augusta Hall," said the father.\r\n"People do think that they are alike."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, what nonsense! You needn\'t tell Mr Gordon that."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he would find it out without telling," continued the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see it, for the life of me," said Mr Blake. He evidently\r\nthought that civility demanded such an assertion. Mr Gordon, looking\r\nat the two young ladies, felt that he would never know them apart\r\nthough he might live in the house for a year.\r\n\r\n"Evelina is the third," continued Mr Hall, pointing out the one whom\r\nMr Blake had specially recommended to his friend\'s notice. "Evelina\r\nis not quite so like, but she\'s like too."\r\n\r\n"Papa, what nonsense you do talk!" said Evelina.\r\n\r\n"And this is Mary. Mary considers herself to be quite the hope of the\r\nfamily; _spem gregis_. Ha, ha!"\r\n\r\n"What does _spem gregis_ mean? I\'m sure I don\'t know," said Mary.\r\nThe four young ladies were about thirty, varying up from thirty to\r\nthirty-five. They were fair-haired, healthy young women, with good\r\ncommon-sense, not beautiful, though very like their father.\r\n\r\n"And now I must introduce you to Miss Forrester,--Kattie Forrester,"\r\nsaid Mr Blake, who was beginning to think that his own young lady\r\nwas being left out in the cold.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Mr Hall. "As I had begun with my own, I was\r\nobliged to go on to the end. Miss Forrester--Mr Gordon. Miss\r\nForrester is a young lady whose promotion has been fixed in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"Mr Hall, how can you do me so much injury as to say that? You take\r\naway from me the chance of changing my mind."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the oldest Miss Hall; "and Mr Gordon the possibility of\r\nchanging his. Mr Gordon, what a sad thing it is that Mr Harbottle\r\nshould never have had an opportunity of seeing his old parish once\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I never knew him," said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"But he had been here nearly fifty years. And then to leave the\r\nparish without seeing it any more. It\'s very sad when you look at it\r\nin that light."\r\n\r\n"He has never resided here permanently for a quarter of a century,"\r\nsaid Mr Blake.\r\n\r\n"Off and on in the summer time," said Augusta. "Of course he could\r\nnot take much of the duty, because he had a clergyman\'s throat. I\r\nthink it a great pity that he should have gone off so suddenly."\r\n\r\n"Miss Forrester won\'t wish to have his _resurgam_ sung, I warrant\r\nyou," said Mr Hall.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about _resurgams_," said the young lady, "but I\r\ndon\'t see why the parish shall not be just as well in Mr Blake\'s\r\nhands." Then the young bride was taken away by the four elder ladies\r\nto dress, and the gentlemen followed them half an hour afterwards.\r\n\r\nThey were all very kind to him, and sitting after dinner, Mr Hall\r\nsuggested that Mr Whittlestaff and Miss Lawrie should be asked over\r\nto dine on the next day. John Gordon had already promised to stay\r\nuntil the third, and had made known his intention of going back to\r\nSouth Africa as soon as he could arrange matters. "I\'ve got nothing\r\nto keep me here," he said, "and as there is a good deal of money at\r\nstake, I should be glad to be there as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come! I don\'t know about your having nothing to keep you\r\nhere," said Blake. But as to Mr Hall\'s proposition regarding the\r\ninhabitants of Croker\'s Lodge, Gordon said nothing. He could not\r\nobject to the guests whom a gentleman might ask to his own house; but\r\nhe thought it improbable that either Mr Whittlestaff or Mary should\r\ncome. If he chose to appear and to bring her with him, it must be his\r\nown look-out. At any rate he, Gordon, could say and could do nothing\r\non such an occasion. He had been betrayed into telling his secret to\r\nthis garrulous young parson. There was no help for spilt milk; but it\r\nwas not probable that Mr Blake would go any further, and he at any\r\nrate must be content to bear the man\'s society for one other evening.\r\n"I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t manage to make things pleasant even\r\nyet," said the parson. But to this John Gordon made no reply.\r\n\r\nIn the evening some of the sisters played a few pieces at the piano,\r\nand Miss Forrester sang a few songs. Mr Hall in the meantime went\r\nfast asleep. John Gordon couldn\'t but tell himself that his evenings\r\nat Kimberley were, as a rule, quite as exciting. But then Kattie\r\nForrester did not belong to him, and he had not found himself able\r\nas yet to make a choice between the young ladies. It was, however,\r\ninteresting to see the manner in which the new vicar hung about the\r\nlady of his love, and the evident but innocent pride with which she\r\naccepted the attentions of her admirer.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think she\'s a beautiful girl?" said Blake, coming\r\nto Gordon\'s room after they had all retired to bed; "such\r\ngenuine wit, and so bright, and her singing, you know, is quite\r\nperfect,--absolutely just what it ought to be. I do know something\r\nabout singing myself, because I\'ve had all the parish voices under my\r\nown charge for the last three years. A practice like that goes a long\r\nway, you know." To this Mr Gordon could only give that assent which\r\nsilence is intended to imply. "She\'ll have L5000 at once, you know,\r\nwhich does make her in a manner equal to either of the Miss Halls. I\r\ndon\'t quite know what they\'ll have, but not more than that, I should\r\nthink. The property is entailed, and he\'s a saving man. But if he can\r\nhave put by L20,000, he has done very well; don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Very well indeed."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I might have had one of them; I don\'t mind telling you in\r\nstrictest confidence. But, goodness gracious, after I had once seen\r\nKattie Forrester, there was no longer a doubt. I wish you\'d tell me\r\nwhat you think about her."\r\n\r\n"About Miss Forrester?"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t mind speaking quite openly to me. I\'m that sort of\r\nfellow that I shouldn\'t mind what any fellow said. I\'ve formed my\r\nown ideas, and am not likely to change them. But I should like\r\nto hear, you know, how she strikes a fellow who has been at the\r\ndiamond-fields. I cannot imagine but that you must have a different\r\nidea about women to what we have." Then Mr Blake sat himself down in\r\nan arm-chair at the foot of the bed, and prepared himself to discuss\r\nthe opinion which he did not doubt that his friend was about to\r\ndeliver.\r\n\r\n"A very nice young woman indeed," said John Gordon, who was anxious\r\nto go to bed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you know,--that\'s a kind of thing that anybody can say. There\r\nis no real friendship in that. I want to know the true candid\r\nopinion of a man who has travelled about the world, and has been\r\nat the diamond-fields. It isn\'t everybody who has been at the\r\ndiamond-fields," continued he, thinking that he might thereby flatter\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n"No, not everybody. I suppose a young woman is the same there as\r\nhere, if she have the same natural gifts. Miss Forrester would be\r\npretty anywhere."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a matter of course. Any fellow can see that with half an eye.\r\nAbsolutely beautiful, I should say, rather than pretty."\r\n\r\n"Just so. It\'s only a variation in terms, you know."\r\n\r\n"But then her manner, her music, her language, her wit, and the\r\ncolour of her hair! When I remember it all, I think I\'m the luckiest\r\nfellow in the world. I shall be a deal happier with her than with\r\nAugusta Hall. Don\'t you think so? Augusta was the one intended for\r\nme; but, bless you, I couldn\'t look at her after I had seen Kattie\r\nForrester. I don\'t think you\'ve given me your true unbiassed opinion\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Well; I should be more free-spoken than that, if you were to ask\r\nme about Mary Lawrie. But then, of course, Mary Lawrie is not your\r\nengaged one. It does make a difference. If it does turn out that she\r\nmarries Mr Whittlestaff, I shan\'t think much of her, I can tell you\r\nthat. As it is, as far as looks are concerned, you can\'t compare her\r\nto my Kattie."\r\n\r\n"Comparisons are odious," said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; when you are sure to get the worst of them. You wouldn\'t\r\nthink comparisons odious if you were going to marry Kattie, and it\r\nwas my lot to have Mary Lawrie. Well, yes; I don\'t mind going to bed\r\nnow, as you have owned so much as that."\r\n\r\n"Of all the fools," said Gordon to himself, as he went to his own\r\nchamber,--"of all the fools who were ever turned out in the world to\r\nearn their own bread, he is the most utterly foolish. Yet he will\r\nearn his bread, and will come to no especial grief in the work. If\r\nhe were to go out to Kimberley, no one would pay him a guinea a-week.\r\nBut he will perform the high work of a clergyman of the Church of\r\nEngland indifferently well."\r\n\r\nOn the next morning a messenger was sent over to Croker\'s Hall, and\r\ncame back after due lapse of time with an answer to the effect that\r\nMr Whittlestaff and Miss Lawrie would have pleasure in dining that\r\nday at Little Alresford Park. "That\'s right," said Mr Blake to the\r\nlady of his love. "We shall now, perhaps, be able to put the thing\r\ninto a proper groove. I\'m always very lucky in managing such matters.\r\nNot that I think that Gordon cares very much about the young lady,\r\njudging from what he says of her."\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t see why you should interest yourself."\r\n\r\n"For the young lady\'s sake. A lady always prefers a young gentleman\r\nto an old one. Only think what you\'d feel if you were married to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Montagu! how can you talk such nonsense?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you ever would, because you are not one of those\r\nsort of young ladies. I don\'t suppose that Mary Lawrie likes it\r\nherself; and therefore I\'d break the match off in a moment if I\r\ncould. That\'s what I call good-natured."\r\n\r\nAfter lunch they all went off to the Rookery, which was at the other\r\nside of the park from Gar Wood. It was a beautiful spot, lying at\r\nthe end of the valley, through which they had to get out from their\r\ncarriage, and to walk for half a mile. Only for the sake of doing\r\nhonour to Miss Forrester, they would have gone on foot. But as it\r\nwas, they had all the six horses among them. Mr Gordon was put up\r\non one of the young ladies\' steeds, the squire and the parson each\r\nhad his own, and Miss Evelina was also mounted, as Mr Blake had\r\nsuggested, perhaps with the view to the capture of Mr Gordon. "As\r\nit\'s your first day," whispered Mr Blake to Kattie, "it is so nice,\r\nI think, that the carriage and horses should all come out. Of course\r\nthere is nothing in the distance, but there should be a respect shown\r\non such an occasion. Mr Hall does do everything of this kind just as\r\nit should be."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know the young lady who is coming here to-night," said\r\nEvelina to Mr Gordon.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I knew her before I went abroad."\r\n\r\n"But not Mr Whittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"I had never met Mr Whittlestaff, though I had heard much of his\r\ngoodness."\r\n\r\n"And now they are to be married. Does it not seem to you to be very\r\nhard?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. The young lady seems to have been left by her\r\nfather and step-mother without any engagement, and, indeed, without\r\nany provision. She was brought here, in the first place, from sheer\r\ncharity, and I can certainly understand that when she was here Mr\r\nWhittlestaff should have admired her."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a matter of course," said Evelina.\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff is not at all too old to fall in love with any\r\nyoung lady. This is a pretty place,--a very lovely spot. I think I\r\nlike it almost better than Gar Wood." Then there was no more said\r\nabout Mary Lawrie till they all rode back to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF IS GOING OUT TO DINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"There\'s an invitation come, asking us to dine at Little Alresford\r\nto-day." This was said, soon after breakfast, by Mr Whittlestaff to\r\nMary Lawrie, on the day after Mr Gordon\'s coming. "I think we\'ll\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Could you not leave me behind?"\r\n\r\n"By no means. I want you to become intimate with the girls, who are\r\ngood girls."\r\n\r\n"But Mr Gordon is there."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. That is just what I want. It will be better that you and\r\nhe should meet each other, without the necessity of making a scene."\r\nFrom this it may be understood that Mr Whittlestaff had explained to\r\nMary as much as he had thought necessary of what had occurred between\r\nhim and John Gordon, and that Mary\'s answers had been satisfactory\r\nto his feelings. Mary had told him that she was contented with her\r\nlot in life, as Mr Whittlestaff had proposed it for her. She had\r\nnot been enthusiastic; but then he had not expected it. She had not\r\nassured him that she would forget John Gordon. He had not asked her.\r\nShe had simply said that if he were satisfied,--so was she. "I think\r\nthat with me, dearest, at any rate, you will be safe." "I am quite\r\nsure that I shall be safe," she had answered. And that had been\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will also understand from this that he had sought for\r\nno answer to those burning questions which John Gordon had put to\r\nhim. Had she loved John Gordon the longest? Did she love him the\r\nbest? There was no doubt a certain cautious selfishness in the way\r\nin which he had gone to work. And yet of general selfishness it was\r\nimpossible to accuse him. He was willing to give her everything,--to\r\ndo all for her. And he had first asked her to be his wife, with every\r\nobservance. And then he could always protect himself on the plea that\r\nhe was doing the best he could for her. His property was assured,--in\r\nthe three per cents, as Mrs Baggett had suggested; whereas John\r\nGordon\'s was all in diamonds. How frequently do diamonds melt and\r\ncome to nothing? They are things which a man can carry in his pocket,\r\nand lose or give away. They cannot,--so thought Mr Whittlestaff,--be\r\nsettled in the hands of trustees, or left to the charge of an\r\nexecutor. They cannot be substantiated. Who can say that, when\r\nlooking to a lady\'s interest, this bit of glass may not come up\r\ninstead of that precious stone? "John Gordon might be a very steady\r\nfellow; but we have only his own word for that,"--as Mr Whittlestaff\r\nobserved to himself. There could not be a doubt but that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff himself was the safer staff of the two on which a young\r\nlady might lean. He did make all these excuses for himself, and\r\ndetermined that they were of such a nature that he might rely upon\r\nthem with safety. But still there was a pang in his bosom--a silent\r\nsecret--which kept on whispering to him that he was not the best\r\nbeloved. He had, however, resolved steadfastly that he would not\r\nput that question to Mary. If she did not wish to declare her love,\r\nneither did he. It was a pity, a thousand pities, that it should be\r\nso. A change in her heart might, however, take place. It would come\r\nto pass that she would learn that he was the superior staff on which\r\nto lean. John Gordon might disappear among the diamond-fields, and no\r\nmore be heard of. He, at any rate, would do his best for her, so that\r\nshe should not repent her bargain. But he was determined that the\r\nbargain, as it had been struck, should be carried out. Therefore,\r\nin communicating to Mary the invitation which he had received from\r\nLittle Alresford, he did not find it necessary to make any special\r\nspeech in answer to her inquiry about John Gordon.\r\n\r\nShe understood it all, and could not in her very heart pronounce\r\na judgment against him. She knew that he was doing that which he\r\nbelieved would be the best for her welfare. She, overwhelmed by the\r\ndebt of her gratitude, had acceded to his request, and had been\r\nunable afterwards to depart from her word. She had said that it\r\nshould be so, and she could not then turn upon him and declare that\r\nwhen she had given him her hand, she had been unaware of the presence\r\nof her other lover. There was an injustice, an unkindness, an\r\ningratitude, a selfishness in this, which forbade her to think of\r\nit as being done by herself. It was better for her that she should\r\nsuffer, though the suffering should be through her whole life,\r\nthan that he should be disappointed. No doubt the man would suffer\r\ntoo,--her hero, her lover,--he with whom she would so willingly have\r\nrisked everything, either with or without the diamonds. She could\r\nnot, however, bear to think that Mr Whittlestaff should be so very\r\nprudent and so very wise solely on her behalf. She would go to him,\r\nbut for other reasons than that. As she walked about the place half\r\nthe day, up and down the long walk, she told herself that it was\r\nuseless to contend with her love. She did love John Gordon; she knew\r\nthat she loved him with her whole heart; she knew that she must be\r\ntrue to him;--but still she would marry Mr Whittlestaff, and do her\r\nduty in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call her.\r\nThere would be a sacrifice--a sacrifice of two--but still it was\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nHad she not consented to take everything from Mr Whittlestaff; her\r\nbread, her meat, her raiment, the shelter under which she lived, and\r\nthe position in the world which she now enjoyed? Had the man come but\r\na day earlier, it would all have been well. She would have told her\r\nlove before Mr Whittlestaff had spoken of his wants. Circumstances\r\nhad been arranged differently, and she must bear it. But she knew\r\nthat it would be better for her that she should see John Gordon\r\nno more. Had he started at once to London and gone thence to the\r\ndiamond-fields without seeing her again there would be a feeling that\r\nshe had become the creature of stern necessity; there would have been\r\nno hope for her,--as also no fear. Had he started a second time for\r\nSouth Africa, she would have looked upon his further return with\r\nany reference to her own wants as a thing impossible. But now how\r\nwould it be with her? Mr Whittlestaff had told her with a stern\r\nindifference that she must again meet this man, sit at the table with\r\nhim as an old friend, and be again subject to his influence. "It will\r\nbe better that you and he should meet," he had said, "without the\r\nnecessity of making a scene." How could she assure him that there\r\nwould be no scene?\r\n\r\nThen she thought that she would have recourse to that ordinary\r\nfeminine excuse, a headache; but were she to do so she would own the\r\nwhole truth to her master; she would have declared that she so loved\r\nthe man that she could not endure to be in his presence. She must\r\nnow let the matter pass as he had intended. She must go to Mr Hall\'s\r\nhouse, and there encounter him she loved with what show of coldness\r\nshe might be able to assume.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of it all lay in this,--that she could not but think\r\nthat he had been induced to remain in the neighbourhood in order that\r\nhe might again try to gain his point. She had told herself again\r\nand again that it was impossible, that she must decide as she had\r\ndecided, and that Mr Whittlestaff had decided so also. He had used\r\nwhat eloquence was within his reach, and it had been all in vain.\r\nHe could now appeal only to herself, and to such appeal there could\r\nbe but one answer. And how was such appeal to be made in Mr Hall\'s\r\ndrawing-room? Surely John Gordon had been foolish in remaining in the\r\nneighbourhood. Nothing but trouble could come of it.\r\n\r\n"So you are going to see this young man again!" This came from Mrs\r\nBaggett, who had been in great perturbation all the morning. The\r\nSergeant had slept in the stables through the night, and had had his\r\nbreakfast brought to him, warm, by his own wife; but he had sat up\r\namong the straw, and had winked at her, and had asked her to give him\r\nthreepence of gin with the cat-lap. To this she had acceded, thinking\r\nprobably that she could not altogether deprive him of the food to\r\nwhich he was accustomed without injury. Then, under the influence\r\nof the gin and the promise of a ticket to Portsmouth, which she\r\nundertook to get for him at the station, he was induced to go down\r\nwith her, and was absolutely despatched. Her own box was still locked\r\nup, and she had slept with one of the two maids. All this had not\r\nhappened without great disturbance in the household. She herself was\r\nvery angry with her master because of the box; she was very angry\r\nwith Mary, because Mary was, she thought, averse to her old lover;\r\nshe was very angry with Mr Gordon, because she well understood that\r\nMr Gordon was anxious to disturb the arrangement which had been made\r\nfor the family. She was very angry with her husband, not because he\r\nwas generally a drunken old reprobate, but because he had especially\r\ndisgraced her on the present occasion by the noise which he had made\r\nin the road. No doubt she had been treated unfairly in the matter of\r\nthe box, and could have succeeded in getting the law of her master.\r\nBut she could not turn against her master in that way. She could give\r\nhim a bit of her own mind, and that she did very freely; but she\r\ncould not bring herself to break the lock of his door. And then, as\r\nthings went now, she did think it well that she should remain a few\r\ndays longer at Croker\'s Hall. The occasion of her master\'s marriage\r\nwas to be the cause of her going away. She could not endure not to be\r\nforemost among all the women at Croker\'s Hall. But it was intolerable\r\nto her feelings that any one should interfere with her master; and\r\nshe thought that, if need were, she could assist him by her tongue.\r\nTherefore she was disposed to remain yet a few days in her old place,\r\nand had come, after she had got the ticket for her husband,--which\r\nhad been done before Mr Whittlestaff\'s breakfast,--to inform her\r\nmaster of her determination. "Don\'t be a fool," Mr Whittlestaff had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I\'m always a fool, whether I go or stay, so that don\'t much matter."\r\nThis had been her answer, and then she had gone in to scold the\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had heard of the intended dinner-party, she attacked\r\nMary Lawrie. "So you\'re going to see this young man again?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff is going to dine at Little Alresford, and intends\r\nto take me with him."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; that\'s all very well. He\'d have left you behind if he\'d\r\nbeen of my way of thinking. Mr Gordon here, and Mr Gordon there! I\r\nwonder what\'s Mr Gordon! He ain\'t no better than an ordinary miner.\r\nCoals and diamonds is all one to me;--I\'d rather have the coals for\r\nchoice." But Mary was not in a humour to contest the matter with Mrs\r\nBaggett, and left the old woman the mistress of the field.\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for going to the dinner, Mr Whittlestaff took\r\nMary in the pony carriage with him. "There is always a groom about\r\nthere," he said, "so we need not take the boy." His object was, as\r\nMary in part understood, that he should be able to speak what last\r\nwords he might have to utter without having other ears than hers to\r\nlisten to them.\r\n\r\nMary would have been surprised had she known how much painful thought\r\nMr Whittlestaff gave to the matter. To her it seemed as though he\r\nhad made up his mind without any effort, and was determined to abide\r\nby it. He had thought it well to marry her; and having asked her,\r\nand having obtained her consent, he intended to take advantage of\r\nher promise. That was her idea of Mr Whittlestaff, as to which she\r\ndid not at all blame him. But he was, in truth, changing his purpose\r\nevery quarter of an hour;--or not changing it, but thinking again and\r\nagain throughout the entire day whether he would not abandon himself\r\nand all his happiness to the romantic idea of making this girl\r\nsupremely happy. Were he to do so, he must give up everything. The\r\nworld would have nothing left for him as to which he could feel the\r\nslightest interest. There came upon him at such moments insane ideas\r\nas to the amount of sacrifice which would be demanded of him. She\r\nshould have everything--his house, his fortune; and he, John Gordon,\r\nas being a part of her, should have them also. He, Whittlestaff,\r\nwould abolish himself as far as such abolition might be possible.\r\nThe idea of suicide was abominable to him--was wicked, cowardly, and\r\ninhuman. But if this were to take place he could wish to cease to\r\nlive. Then he would comfort himself by assuring himself again and\r\nagain that of the two he would certainly make the better husband. He\r\nwas older. Yes; it was a pity that he should be so much the elder.\r\nAnd he knew that he was old of his age,--such a one as a girl like\r\nMary Lawrie could hardly be brought to love passionately. He brought\r\nup against himself all the hard facts as sternly as could any younger\r\nrival. He looked at himself in the glass over and over again, and\r\nalways gave the verdict against his own appearance. There was nothing\r\nto recommend him. So he told himself,--judging of himself most\r\nunfairly. He set against himself as evils little points by which\r\nMary\'s mind and Mary\'s judgment would never be affected. But in truth\r\nthroughout it all he thought only of her welfare. But there came upon\r\nhim constantly an idea that he hardly knew how to be as good to her\r\nas he would have been had it not been for Catherine Bailey. To have\r\nattempted twice, and twice to have failed so disastrously! He was a\r\nman to whom to have failed once in such a matter was almost death.\r\nHow should he bear it twice and still live? Nevertheless he did\r\nendeavour to think only of her welfare. "You won\'t find it cold, my\r\ndear?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Cold! Why, Mr Whittlestaff, it\'s quite hot."\r\n\r\n"I meant hot. I did mean to say hot."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got my parasol."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--ah!--yes; so I perceive. Go on, Tommy. That foolish old woman\r\nwill settle down at last, I think." To this Mary could make no\r\nanswer, because, according to her ideas, Mrs Baggett\'s settling down\r\nmust depend on her master\'s marriage. "I think it very civil of Mr\r\nHall asking us in this way."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is."\r\n\r\n"Because you may be sure he had heard of your former acquaintance\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt about it. He said as much to me in his note. That young\r\nclergyman of his will have told him everything. \'Percontatorem fugito\r\nnam garrulus idem est.\' I\'ve taught you Latin enough to understand\r\nthat. But, Mary, if you wish to change your mind, this will be your\r\nlast opportunity." His heart at that moment had been very tender\r\ntowards her, and she had resolved that hers should be very firm to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF GOES OUT TO DINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would be her last opportunity. So Mary told herself as she got\r\nout of the carriage at Mr Hall\'s front door. It was made manifest to\r\nher by such a speech that he did not expect that she should do so,\r\nbut looked upon her doing so as within the verge of possibility. She\r\ncould still do it, and yet not encounter his disgust or his horror.\r\nHow terrible was the importance to herself, and, as she believed, to\r\nthe other man also. Was she not justified in so thinking? Mr Gordon\r\nhad come home, travelling a great distance, at much risk to his\r\nproperty, at great loss of time, through infinite trouble and danger,\r\nmerely to ask her to be his wife. Had a letter reached her from him\r\nbut a week ago bidding her to come, would she not have gone through\r\nall the danger and all the trouble? How willingly would she have\r\ngone! It was the one thing that she desired; and, as far as she could\r\nunderstand the signs which he had given, it was the one, one thing\r\nwhich he desired. He had made his appeal to that other man, and, as\r\nfar as she could understand the signs which had reached her, had been\r\nreferred with confidence to her decision. Now she was told that the\r\nchance of changing her mind was still in her power.\r\n\r\nThe matter was one of terrible importance; but was its importance\r\nto Mr Whittlestaff as great as to John Gordon? She put herself\r\naltogether out of the question. She acknowledged to herself, with a\r\nfalse humility, that she was nobody;--she was a poor woman living on\r\ncharity, and was not to be thought of when the position of these two\r\nmen was taken into consideration. It chanced that they both wanted\r\nher. Which wanted the most? Which of the two would want her for the\r\nlongest? To which would her services be of the greater avail in\r\nassisting him to his happiness. Could there be a doubt? Was it not\r\nin human nature that she should bind herself to the younger man, and\r\nwith him go through the world, whether safely or in danger?\r\n\r\nBut though she had had time to allow these questions to pass through\r\nher mind between the utterance of Mr Whittlestaff\'s words and her\r\nentrance into Mr Hall\'s drawing-room, she did not in truth doubt.\r\nShe knew that she had made up her mind on the matter. Mr Gordon\r\nwould in all probability have no opportunity of saying another word\r\nto her. But let him say what word he might, it should be in vain.\r\nNothing that he could say, nothing that she could say, would avail\r\nanything. If this other man would release her,--then indeed she would\r\nbe released. But there was no chance of such release coming. In\r\ntruth, Mary did not know how near the chance was to her;--or rather,\r\nhow near the chance had been. He had now positively made up his mind,\r\nand would say not a word further unless she asked him. If Mary said\r\nnothing to John Gordon on this evening, he would take an opportunity\r\nbefore they left the house to inform Mr Hall of his intended\r\nmarriage. When once the word should have passed his mouth, he could\r\nnot live under the stigma of a second Catherine Bailey.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lawrie, pray let me make you known to my intended." This came\r\nfrom Mr Montagu Blake, who felt himself to be justified by his\r\npeculiar circumstances in so far taking upon himself the work of\r\nintroducing the guests in Mr Hall\'s house. "Of course, you\'ve heard\r\nall about it. I am the happiest young man in Hampshire,--and she is\r\nthe next."\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself, Montagu. I am not a young man at all."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a young man\'s darling, which is the next thing to it."\r\n\r\n"How are you, Whittlestaff?" said Mr Hall. "Wonderful weather, isn\'t\r\nit? I\'m told that you\'ve been in trouble about that drunken husband\r\nwhich plagues the life out of that respectable housekeeper of yours."\r\n\r\n"He is a trouble; but if he is bad to me, how much worse must he be\r\nto her?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. He must be very bad, I should think. Miss Mary, why\r\ndon\'t you come over this fine weather, and have tea with my girls and\r\nKattie Forrester in the woods? You should take your chance while you\r\nhave a young man willing to wait upon you."\r\n\r\n"I shall be quite delighted," said Blake, "and so will John Gordon."\r\n\r\n"Only that I shall be in London this time to-morrow," said Gordon.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense. You are not going to Kimberley all at once. The\r\nyoung ladies expect you to bring out a lot of diamonds and show them\r\nbefore you start. Have you seen his diamonds, Miss Lawrie?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed no," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I think I should have asked just to see them," said Evelina Hall.\r\nWhy should they join her name with his in this uncivil manner, or\r\nsuppose that she had any special power to induce him to show his\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n"When you first find a diamond," said Mr Hall, "what do you do with\r\nit? Do you ring a bell and call together your friends, and begin to\r\nrejoice."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. The diamond is generally washed out of the mud by some\r\nnigger, and we have to look very sharp after him to see that he\r\ndoesn\'t hide it under his toe-nails. It\'s not a very romantic kind of\r\nbusiness from first to last."\r\n\r\n"Only profitable," said the curate.\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be. It is subject to greater losses than the preaching\r\nof sermons."\r\n\r\n"I should like to go out and see it all," said Miss Hall, looking\r\ninto Miss Lawrie\'s face. This also appeared to Mary to be\r\nill-natured.\r\n\r\nThen the butler announced the dinner, and they all followed Mr Hall\r\nand the curate\'s bride out of one room into the other. "This young\r\nlady," said he, "is supposed to be in the ascendant just at the\r\npresent moment. She can\'t be married above two or three times at the\r\nmost. I say this to excuse myself to Miss Lawrie, who ought perhaps\r\nto have the post of honour." To this some joking reply was made,\r\nand they all sat down to their dinner. Miss Lawrie was at Mr Hall\'s\r\nleft hand, and at her left hand John Gordon was seated. Mary could\r\nperceive that everything was arranged so as to throw herself and John\r\nGordon together,--as though they had some special interest in each\r\nother. Of all this Mr Whittlestaff saw nothing. But John Gordon did\r\nperceive something, and told himself that that ass Blake had been at\r\nwork. But his perceptions in the matter were not half as sharp as\r\nthose of Mary Lawrie.\r\n\r\n"I used to be very fond of your father, Gordon," said Mr Hall, when\r\nthe dinner was half over. "It\'s all done and gone now. Dear, dear,\r\ndear!"\r\n\r\n"He was an unfortunate man, and perhaps expected too much from his\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see his son here, at any rate. I wish you were not\r\ngoing to settle down so far away from us."\r\n\r\n"Kimberley is a long way off."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; and when a fellow gets out there he is apt to stay, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"I shall do so, probably. I have nobody near enough to me here at\r\nhome to make it likely that I shall come back."\r\n\r\n"You have uncles and aunts?" said Mr Hall.\r\n\r\n"One uncle and two aunts. I shall suit their views and my cousins\'\r\nbetter by sending home some diamonds than by coming myself."\r\n\r\n"How long will that take?" asked Mr Hall. The conversation was kept\r\nup solely between Mr Hall and John Gordon. Mr Whittlestaff took no\r\nshare in it unless when he was asked a question, and the four girls\r\nkept up a whisper with Miss Forrester and Montagu Blake.\r\n\r\n"I have a share in rather a good thing," said Gordon; "and if I could\r\nget out of it so as to realise my property, I think that six months\r\nmight suffice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! Then we may have you back again before the year\'s out?"\r\nMr Whittlestaff looked up at this, as though apprised that the\r\ndanger was not yet over. But he reflected that before twelve months\r\nwere gone he would certainly have made Mary Lawrie his wife.\r\n\r\n"Kimberley is not a very alluring place," said John Gordon. "I don\'t\r\nknow any spot on God\'s earth that I should be less likely to choose\r\nas my abiding resting-place."\r\n\r\n"Except for the diamonds."\r\n\r\n"Except for the diamonds, as you remark. And therefore when a man has\r\ngot his fill of diamonds, he is likely to leave."\r\n\r\n"His fill of diamonds!" said Augusta Hall.\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t you like to try your fill of diamonds?" asked Blake.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Evelina. "I\'d rather have strawberries and cream."\r\n\r\n"I think I should like diamonds best," said Mary. Whereupon Evelina\r\nsuggested that her younger sister was a greedy little creature.\r\n\r\n"As soon as you\'ve got your fill of diamonds, which won\'t take\r\nmore than six months longer," suggested Mr Hall, "you\'ll come back\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. I have an idea of going up the country across the\r\nZambesi. I\'ve a notion that I should like to make my way out\r\nsomewhere in the Mediterranean,--Egypt, for instance, or Algiers."\r\n\r\n"What!--across the equator? You\'d never do that alive?"\r\n\r\n"Things of that kind have been done. Stanley crossed the continent."\r\n\r\n"But not from south to north. I don\'t believe in that. You had better\r\nremain at Kimberley and get more diamonds."\r\n\r\n"He\'d be with diamonds like the boy with the bacon," said the\r\nclergyman; "when prepared for another wish, he\'d have more than he\r\ncould eat."\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth," said John Gordon, "I don\'t quite know what I\r\nshould do. It would depend perhaps on what somebody else would join\r\nme in doing. My life was very lonely at Kimberley, and I do not love\r\nbeing alone."\r\n\r\n"Then, why don\'t you take a wife?" said Montagu Blake, very loudly,\r\nas though he had hit the target right in the bull\'s-eye. He so spoke\r\nas to bring the conversation to an abrupt end. Mr Whittlestaff\r\nimmediately looked conscious. He was a man who, on such an occasion,\r\ncould not look otherwise than conscious. And the five girls, with all\r\nof whom the question of the loves of John Gordon and Mary Lawrie had\r\nbeen fully discussed, looked conscious. Mary Lawrie was painfully\r\nconscious; but endeavoured to hide it, not unsuccessfully. But in\r\nher endeavour she had to look unnaturally stern,--and was conscious,\r\ntoo, that she did that. Mr Hall, whose feelings of romance were not\r\nperhaps of the highest order, looked round on Mr Whittlestaff and\r\nMary Lawrie. Montagu Blake felt that he had achieved a triumph.\r\n"Yes," said he, "if those are your feelings, why don\'t you take a\r\nwife?"\r\n\r\n"One man may not be so happy as another," said Gordon, laughing. "You\r\nhave suited yourself admirably, and seem to think it quite easy for a\r\nman to make a selection."\r\n\r\n"Not quite such a selection as mine, perhaps," said Blake.\r\n\r\n"Then think of the difficulty. Do you suppose that any second Miss\r\nForrester would dream of going to the diamond-fields with me?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Blake. "Not a second Miss Forrester--but somebody\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Something inferior?"\r\n\r\n"Well--yes; inferior to my Miss Forrester, certainly."\r\n\r\n"You are the most conceited young man that I ever came across," said\r\nthe young lady herself.\r\n\r\n"And I am not inclined to put up with anything that is very\r\ninferior," said John Gordon. He could not help his eye from glancing\r\nfor a moment round upon Mary Lawrie. She was aware of it, though no\r\none else noticed it in the room. She was aware of it, though any one\r\nwatching her would have said that she had never looked at him.\r\n\r\n"A man may always find a woman to suit him, if he looks well\r\nabout him," said Mr Hall, sententiously. "Don\'t you think so,\r\nWhittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say he may," said Mr Whittlestaff, very flatly. And as he\r\nsaid so he made up his mind that he would, for that day, postpone the\r\ntask of telling Mr Hall of his intended marriage.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed by, and the time came for Mr Whittlestaff to\r\ndrive Miss Lawrie back to Croker\'s Hall. She had certainly spent a\r\nmost uneventful period, as far as action or even words of her own was\r\nconcerned. But the afternoon was one which she would never forget.\r\nShe had been quite, quite sure, when she came into the house; but she\r\nwas more than sure now. At every word that had been spoken she had\r\nthought of herself and of him. Would he not have known how to have\r\nchosen a fit companion,--only for this great misfortune? And would\r\nshe have been so much inferior to Miss Forrester? Would he have\r\nthought her inferior to any one? Would he not have preferred her to\r\nany other female whom the world had at the present moment produced?\r\nOh, the pity of it; the pity of it!\r\n\r\nThen came the bidding of adieu. Gordon was to sleep at Little\r\nAlresford that night, and to take his departure by early train on the\r\nnext morning. Of the adieux spoken the next morning we need take no\r\nnotice, but only of the word or two uttered that night. "Good-bye,\r\nMr Gordon," said Mr Whittlestaff, having taken courage for the\r\noccasion, and having thought even of the necessary syllables to be\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr Whittlestaff," and he gave his rival his hand in\r\napparently friendly grasp. To those burning questions he had asked he\r\nhad received no word of reply; but they were questions which he would\r\nnot repeat again.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr Gordon," said Mary. She had thought of the moment\r\nmuch, but had determined at last that she would trust herself to\r\nnothing further. He took her hand, but did not say a word. He took it\r\nand pressed it for a moment, and then turned his face away, and went\r\nin from the hall back to the door leading to the drawing-room. Mr\r\nWhittlestaff was at the moment putting on his great-coat, and Mary\r\nstood with her bonnet and cloak on at the open front door, listening\r\nto a word or two from Kattie Forrester and Evelina Hall. "Oh, I wish,\r\nI wish it might have been!" said Kattie Forrester.\r\n\r\n"And so do I," said Evelina. "Can\'t it be?"\r\n\r\n"Good-night," said Mary, boldly, stepping out rapidly into the\r\nmoonlight, and mounting without assistance to her place in the open\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Mr Hall, following her; but there came not\r\na word from her.\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff had gone back after John Gordon. "By-the-by," he\r\nsaid, "what will be your address in London?"\r\n\r\n"The \'Oxford and Cambridge\' in Pall Mall," said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; the club there. It might be that I should have a word to\r\nsend to you. But I don\'t suppose I shall," he added, as he turned\r\nround to go away. Then he shook hands with the party in the hall, and\r\nmounting up into the carriage, drove Mary and himself away homewards\r\ntowards Croker\'s Hall.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken between them for the first mile, nor did a\r\nsound of a sob or an audible suspicion of a tear come from Mary. Why\r\ndid those girls know the secret of her heart in that way? Why had\r\nthey dared to express a hope as to an event, or an idea as to a\r\ndisappointment, all knowledge of which ought to be buried in her own\r\nbosom? Had she spoken of her love for John Gordon? She was sure that\r\nno word had escaped her. And were it surmised, was it not customary\r\nthat such surmises should be kept in the dark? But here these young\r\nladies had dared to pity her for her vain love, as though, like some\r\nvillage maiden, she had gone about in tears bewailing herself that\r\nsome groom or gardener had been faithless. But sitting thus for the\r\nfirst mile, she choked herself to keep down her sobs.\r\n\r\n"Mary," at last he whispered to her.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr Whittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"Mary, we are both of us unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I am not unhappy," she said, plucking up herself suddenly. "Why do\r\nyou say that I am unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"You seem so. I at any rate am unhappy."\r\n\r\n"What makes you so?"\r\n\r\n"I did wrong to take you to dine in company with that man."\r\n\r\n"It was not for me to refuse to go."\r\n\r\n"No; there is no blame to you in it;--nor is there blame to me. But\r\nit would have been better for us both had we remained away." Then he\r\ndrove on in silence, and did not speak another word till they reached\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Mrs Baggett, following them into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by \'well\'?"\r\n\r\n"What did the folks say to you at Mr Hall\'s? I can see by your face\r\nthat some of them have been saying summat."\r\n\r\n"Nobody has been saying anything that I know of," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. "Do you go to bed." Then when Mrs Baggett was gone,\r\nand Mary had listlessly seated herself on a chair, her lover again\r\naddressed her. "I wish I knew what there is in your heart." Yet she\r\nwould not tell him; but turned away her face and sat silent. "Have\r\nyou nothing to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"What should I have to say to you? I have nothing to say of that of\r\nwhich you are thinking."\r\n\r\n"He has gone now, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he has gone."\r\n\r\n"And you are contented?" It did seem hard upon her that she should be\r\ncalled upon to tell a lie,--to say that which he must know to be a\r\nlie,--and to do so in order that he might be encouraged to persevere\r\nin achieving his own object. But she did not quite understand him.\r\n"Are you contented?" he repeated again.\r\n\r\nThen she thought that she would tell the lie. If it was well that\r\nshe should make the sacrifice for his sake, why should it not be\r\ncompleted? If she had to give herself to him, why should not the gift\r\nbe as satisfactory as it might be made to his feelings? "Yes; I am\r\ncontented."\r\n\r\n"And you do not wish to see him again?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, as your wife."\r\n\r\n"You do not wish it at all," he rejoined, "whether you be my wife or\r\notherwise?"\r\n\r\n"I think you press me too hard." Then she remembered herself, and the\r\nperfect sacrifice which she was minded to make. "No; I do not wish\r\nagain to see Mr Gordon at all. Now, if you will allow me, I will\r\ngo to bed. I am thoroughly tired out, and I hardly know what I am\r\nsaying."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you can go to bed," he said. Then she gave him her hand in\r\nsilence, and went off to her own room.\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner reached her bed, than she threw herself on it and\r\nburst into tears. All this which she had to endure,--all that she\r\nwould have to bear,--would be, she thought, too much for her. And\r\nthere came upon her a feeling of contempt for his cruelty. Had he\r\nsternly resolved to keep her to her promised word, and to forbid her\r\nall happiness for the future,--to make her his wife, let her heart be\r\nas it might;--had he said: "you have come to my house, and have eaten\r\nmy bread and have drunk of my cup, and have then promised to become\r\nmy wife, and now you shall not depart from it because this interloper\r\nhas come between us;"--then, though she might have felt him to be\r\ncruel, still she would have respected him. He would have done, as she\r\nbelieved, as other men do. But he wished to gain his object, and yet\r\nnot appear to be cruel. It was so that she thought of him. "And it\r\nshall be as he would have it," she said to herself. But though she\r\nsaw far into his character, she did not quite read it aright.\r\n\r\nHe remained there alone in his library into the late hours of the\r\nnight. But he did not even take up a book with the idea of solacing\r\nhis hours. He too had his idea of self-sacrifice, which went quite\r\nas far as hers. But yet he was not as sure as was she that the\r\nself-sacrifice would be a duty. He did not believe, as did she, in\r\nthe character of John Gordon. What if he should give her up to one\r\nwho did not deserve her,--to one whose future would not be stable\r\nenough to secure the happiness and welfare of such a woman as was\r\nMary Lawrie! He had no knowledge to guide him, nor had she;--nor, for\r\nthe matter of that, had John Gordon himself any knowledge of what his\r\nown future might be. Of his own future Mr Whittlestaff could speak\r\nand think with the greatest confidence. It would be safe, happy, and\r\nbright, should Mary Lawrie become his wife. Should she not do so, it\r\nmust be altogether ruined and confounded.\r\n\r\nHe could not conceive it to be possible that he should be required\r\nby duty to make such a sacrifice; but he knew of himself that if her\r\nhappiness, her true and permanent happiness, would require it, then\r\nthe sacrifice should be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMRS BAGGETT\'S PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Saturday, and Mr Whittlestaff came out of his room\r\nearly, intending to speak to Mrs Baggett. He had declared to himself\r\nthat it was his purpose to give her some sound advice respecting her\r\nown affairs,--as far as her affairs and his were connected together.\r\nBut low down in his mind, below the stratum in which his declared\r\nresolution was apparent to himself, there was a hope that he might\r\nget from her some comfort and strength as to his present purpose. Not\r\nbut that he would ultimately do as he himself had determined; but, to\r\ntell the truth, he had not quite determined, and thought that a word\r\nfrom Mrs Baggett might assist him.\r\n\r\nAs he came out from his room, he encountered Mary, intent upon her\r\nhousehold duties. It was something before her usual time, and he was\r\nsurprised. She had looked ill overnight and worn, and he had expected\r\nthat she would keep her bed. "What makes you so early, Mary?" He\r\nspoke to her with his softest and most affectionate tone.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t sleep, and I thought I might as well be up." She had\r\nfollowed him into the library, and when there he put his arm round\r\nher waist and kissed her forehead. It was a strange thing for him\r\nto do. She felt that it was so--very, very strange; but it never\r\noccurred to her that it behoved her to be angry at his caress. He had\r\nkissed her once before, and only once, and it had seemed to her that\r\nhe had intended that their love-making should go on without kisses.\r\nBut was she not his property, to do as he pleased with her? And there\r\ncould be no ground for displeasure on her part.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mary," he said, "if you could only know how constant my\r\nthoughts are to you." She did not doubt that it was so; but just so\r\nconstant were her thoughts to John Gordon. But from her to him there\r\ncould be no show of affection--nothing but the absolute coldness\r\nof perfect silence. She had passed the whole evening with him last\r\nnight, and had not been allowed to speak a single word to him beyond\r\nthe ordinary greetings of society. She had felt that she had not\r\nbeen allowed to speak a single word to any one, because he had been\r\npresent. Mr Whittlestaff had thrown over her the deadly mantle of\r\nhis ownership, and she had consequently felt herself to be debarred\r\nfrom all right over her own words and actions. She had become his\r\nslave; she felt herself in very truth to be a poor creature whose\r\nonly duty it was in the world to obey his volition. She had told\r\nherself during the night that, with all her motives for loving him,\r\nshe was learning to regard him with absolute hatred. And she hated\r\nherself because it was so. Oh, what a tedious affair was this of\r\nliving! How tedious, how sad and miserable, must her future days be,\r\nas long as days should be left to her! Could it be made possible to\r\nher that she should ever be able to do her duty by this husband of\r\nhers,--for her, in whose heart of hearts would be seated continually\r\nthe image of this other man?\r\n\r\n"By-the-by," said he, "I want to see Mrs Baggett. I suppose she is\r\nabout somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes. Since the trouble of her husband has become nearer,\r\nshe is earlier and earlier every day. Shall I send her?" Then she\r\ndeparted, and in a few minutes Mrs Baggett entered the room.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"I have just a few words which I want to say to you. Your husband has\r\ngone back to Portsmouth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir; he have." This she said in a very decided tone, as though\r\nher master need trouble himself no further about her husband.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad that it should be so. It\'s the best place for\r\nhim,--unless he could be sent to Australia."\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t a-done nothing to fit himself for Botany Bay, Mr\r\nWhittlestaff," said the old woman, bobbing her head at him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what place he has fitted himself for, so long as he\r\ndoesn\'t come here. He is a disreputable old man."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be so hard upon him, Mr Whittlestaff. He ain\'t a-done\r\nnothing much to you, barring sleeping in the stable one night when\r\nhe had had a drop o\' drink too much." And the old woman pulled out a\r\ngreat handkerchief, and began to wipe her eyes piteously.\r\n\r\n"What a fool you are, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am a fool. I knows that."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s this disreputable old man eating and drinking your\r\nhard-earned wages."\r\n\r\n"But they are my wages. And who\'s a right to them, only he?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say anything about that, only he comes here and disturbs\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; he is disturbing; if it\'s only because of his wooden leg\r\nand red nose. I don\'t mean to say as he\'s the sort of a man as does a\r\ncredit to a gentleman\'s house to see about the place. But he was my\r\nlot in matrimony, and I\'ve got to put up with him. I ain\'t a-going to\r\nrefuse to bear the burden which came to be my lot. I don\'t suppose\r\nhe\'s earned a single shilling since he left the regiment, and that is\r\nhard upon a poor woman who\'s got nothing but her wages."\r\n\r\n"Now, look here, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Send him your wages."\r\n\r\n"And have to go in rags myself,--in your service."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t go in rags. Don\'t be a fool."\r\n\r\n"I am a fool, Mr Whittlestaff; you can\'t tell me that too often."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t go in rags. You ought to know us well enough--"\r\n\r\n"Who is us, Mr Whittlestaff? They ain\'t no us;--just yet."\r\n\r\n"Well;--me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know you, Mr Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"Send him your wages. You may be quite sure that you\'ll find yourself\r\nprovided with shoes and stockings, and the rest of it."\r\n\r\n"And be a woluntary burden beyond what I earns! Never;--not as long\r\nas Miss Mary is coming to live here as missus of your house. I should\r\ndo summat as I should have to repent of. But, Mr Whittlestaff, I\'ve\r\ngot to look the world in the face, and bear my own crosses. I never\r\ncan do it no younger."\r\n\r\n"You\'re an old woman now, and you talk of throwing yourself upon the\r\nworld without the means of earning a shilling."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'d earn some, at something, old as I am, till I fell down\r\nflat dead," she said. "I have that sperit in me, that I\'d still be\r\ndoing something. But it don\'t signify; I\'m not going to remain here\r\nwhen Miss Mary is to be put over me. That\'s the long and the short of\r\nit all."\r\n\r\nNow had come the moment in which, if ever, Mr Whittlestaff must\r\nget the strength which he required. He was quite sure of the old\r\nwoman,--that her opinion would not be in the least influenced by any\r\ndesire on her own part to retain her position as his housekeeper. "I\r\ndon\'t know about putting Miss Mary over you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know about it!" she shouted.\r\n\r\n"My mind is not absolutely fixed."\r\n\r\n"\'As she said anything?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Or he? Has he been and dared to speak up about Miss Mary. And\r\nhe,--who, as far as I can understand, has never done a ha\'porth for\r\nher since the beginning. What\'s Mr Gordon? I should like to know.\r\nDiamonds! What\'s diamonds in the way of a steady income? They\'re all\r\na flash in the pan, and moonshine and dirtiness. I hates to hear of\r\ndiamonds. There\'s all the ill in the world comes from them; and you\'d\r\ngive her up to be taken off by such a one as he among the diamonds!\r\nI make bold to tell you, Mr Whittlestaff, that you ought to have more\r\nstrength of mind than what that comes to. You\'re telling me every day\r\nas I\'m an old fool."\r\n\r\n"So you are."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t never contradict you; nor I don\'t mean, if you tells me so\r\nas often again. And I don\'t mean to be that impident as to tell my\r\nmaster as I ain\'t the only fool about the place. It wouldn\'t be no\r\nwise becoming."\r\n\r\n"But you think it would be true."\r\n\r\n"I says nothing about that. That\'s not the sort of language anybody\r\nhas heard to come out of my mouth, either before your face or behind\r\nyour back. But I do say as a man ought to behave like a man. What!\r\nGive up to a chap as spends his time in digging for diamonds! Never!"\r\n\r\n"What does it matter what he digs for; you know nothing about his\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"But I know something about yours, Mr Whittlestaff. I know where you\r\nhave set your wishes. And I know that when a man has made up his mind\r\nin such an affair as this, he shouldn\'t give way to any young diamond\r\ndealer of them all."\r\n\r\n"Not to him."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s she? Are you to give up everything because she\'s\r\nlove-sick for a day or two? Is everything to be knocked to pieces\r\nhere at Croker\'s Hall, because he has come and made eyes at her? She\r\nwas glad enough to take what you offered before he had come this\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"She was not glad enough. That is it. She was not glad enough."\r\n\r\n"She took you, at any rate, and I\'d never make myself mean enough to\r\nmake way for such a fellow as that."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t for him, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"It is for him. Who else? To walk away and just leave the game open\r\nbecause he has come down to Hampshire! There ain\'t no spirit of\r\nstanding up and fighting about it."\r\n\r\n"With whom am I to fight?"\r\n\r\n"With both of \'em;--till you have your own way. A foolish, stupid,\r\nweak girl like that!"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have her abused."\r\n\r\n"She\'s very well. I ain\'t a-saying nothing against her. If she\'ll do\r\nwhat you bid her, she\'ll turn out right enough. You asked her, and\r\nshe said she\'d do it. Is not that so? There\'s nothing I hate so much\r\nas them romantic ways. And everything is to be made to give way\r\nbecause a young chap is six foot high! I hates romance and manly\r\nbeauty, as they call it, and all the rest of it. Where is she to get\r\nher bread and meat? That\'s what I want to know."\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be bread and meat for her."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. But you\'ll have to pay for it, while she\'s philandering\r\nabout with him! And that\'s what you call fine feelings. I call it\r\nall rubbish. If you\'ve a mind to make her Mrs Whittlestaff, make her\r\nMrs Whittlestaff. Drat them fine feelings. I never knew no good come\r\nof what people call fine feelings. If a young woman does her work\r\nas it should be, she\'s got no time to think of \'em. And if a man is\r\nmaster, he should be master. How\'s a man to give way to a girl like\r\nthat, and then stand up and face the world around him? A man has to\r\nbe master; and when he\'s come to be a little old-like, he has to see\r\nthat he will be master. I never knew no good come of one of them\r\nsoft-going fellows who is minded to give up whenever a woman wants\r\nanything. What\'s a woman? It ain\'t natural that she should have her\r\nway; and she don\'t like a man a bit better in the long-run because\r\nhe lets her. There\'s Miss Mary; if you\'re stiff with her now, she\'ll\r\ncome out right enough in a month or two. She\'s lived without Mr\r\nGordon well enough since she\'s been here. Now he\'s come, and we hear\r\na deal about these fine feelings. You take my word, and say nothing\r\nto nobody about the young man. He\'s gone by this time, or he\'s\r\na-going. Let him go, say I; and if Miss Mary takes on to whimper a\r\nbit, don\'t you see it."\r\n\r\nMrs Baggett took her departure, and Mr Whittlestaff felt that he\r\nhad received the comfort, or at any rate the strength, of which he\r\nhad been in quest. In all that the woman had said to him, there had\r\nbeen a re-echo of his own thoughts,--of one side, at any rate, of\r\nhis own thoughts. He knew that true affection, and the substantial\r\ncomforts of the world, would hold their own against all romance.\r\nAnd he did not believe,--in his theory of ethics he did not\r\nbelieve,--that by yielding to what Mrs Baggett called fine feelings,\r\nhe would in the long-run do good to those with whom he was concerned\r\nin the world. Were he to marry Mary Lawrie now, Mary Whittlestaff\r\nwould, he thought, in ten years\' time, be a happier woman than were\r\nhe to leave her. That was the solid conviction of his mind, and in\r\nthat he had been strengthened by Mrs Baggett\'s arguments. He had\r\ndesired to be so strengthened, and therefore his interview had been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nBut as the minutes passed by, as every quarter of an hour added\r\nitself to the quarters that were gone, and as the hours grew on, and\r\nthe weakness of evening fell upon him, all his softness came back\r\nagain. They had dined at six o\'clock, and at seven he declared his\r\npurpose of strolling out by himself. On these summer evenings he\r\nwould often take Mary with him; but he now told her, with a sort of\r\napology, that he would rather go alone. "Do," she said, smiling up\r\ninto his face; "don\'t let me ever be in your way. Of course, a man\r\ndoes not always want to have to find conversation for a young lady."\r\n\r\n"If you are the young lady, I should always want it--only that I have\r\nthings to think of."\r\n\r\n"Go and think of your things. I will sit in the garden and do my\r\nstitching."\r\n\r\nAbout a mile distant, where the downs began to rise, there was a walk\r\nsupposed to be common to all who chose to frequent it, but which was\r\nentered through a gate which gave the place within the appearance of\r\nprivacy. There was a little lake inside crowded with water-lilies,\r\nwhen the time for the water-lilies had come; and above the lake a\r\npath ran up through the woods, very steep, and as it rose higher and\r\nhigher, altogether sheltered. It was about a mile in length till\r\nanother gate was reached; but during the mile the wanderer could\r\ngo off on either side, and lose himself on the grass among the\r\nbeech-trees. It was a favourite haunt with Mr Whittlestaff. Here he\r\nwas wont to sit and read his Horace, and think of the affairs of the\r\nworld as Horace depicted them. Many a morsel of wisdom he had here\r\nmade his own, and had then endeavoured to think whether the wisdom\r\nhad in truth been taken home by the poet to his own bosom, or had\r\nonly been a glitter of the intellect, never appropriated for any\r\nuseful purpose. "\'Gemmas, marmor, ebur,\'" he had said. "\'Sunt qui non\r\nhabeant; est qui non curat habere.\' I suppose he did care for jewels,\r\nmarble, and ivory, as much as any one. \'Me lentus Glycerae torret\r\namor meae.\' I don\'t suppose he ever loved her really, or any other\r\ngirl." Thus he would think over his Horace, always having the volume\r\nin his pocket.\r\n\r\nNow he went there. But when he had sat himself down in a spot to\r\nwhich he was accustomed, he had no need to take out his Horace. His\r\nown thoughts came to him free enough without any need of his looking\r\nfor them to poetry. After all, was not Mrs Baggett\'s teaching a\r\ndamnable philosophy? Let the man be the master, and let him get\r\neverything he can for himself, and enjoy to the best of his ability\r\nall that he can get. That was the lesson as taught by her. But as he\r\nsat alone there beneath the trees, he told himself that no teaching\r\nwas more damnable. Of course it was the teaching by which the world\r\nwas kept going in its present course; but when divested of its\r\nplumage was it not absolutely the philosophy of selfishness? Because\r\nhe was a man, and as a man had power and money and capacity to do the\r\nthings after which his heart lusted, he was to do them for his own\r\ngratification, let the consequences be what they might to one whom\r\nhe told himself that he loved! Did the lessons of Mrs Baggett run\r\nsmoothly with those of Jesus Christ?\r\n\r\nThen within his own mind he again took Mrs Baggett\'s side of the\r\nquestion. How mean a creature must he not become, if he were now to\r\nsurrender this girl whom he was anxious to make his wife! He knew of\r\nhimself that in such a matter he was more sensitive than others. He\r\ncould not let her go, and then walk forth as though little or nothing\r\nwere the matter with him. Now for the second time in his life he had\r\nessayed to marry. And now for the second time all the world would\r\nknow that he had been accepted and then rejected. It was, he thought,\r\nmore than he could endure,--and live.\r\n\r\nThen after he had sat there for an hour he got up and walked\r\nhome; and as he went he tried to resolve that he would reject the\r\nphilosophy of Mrs Baggett and accept the other. "If I only knew!"\r\nhe said as he entered his own gate. "If one could only see clearly!"\r\nThen he found Mary still seated in the garden. "Nothing is to be\r\ngot," he said, "by asking you for an answer."\r\n\r\n"In what have I failed?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Let us go in and have a cup of tea." But she knew well\r\nin what he accused her of failing, and her heart turned towards him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF MEDITATES A JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and was passed in absolute tranquillity.\r\nNothing was said either by Mr Whittlestaff or by Mary Lawrie; nor,\r\nto the eyes of those among whom they lived, was there anything to\r\nshow that their minds were disturbed. They went to church in the\r\nmorning, as was usual with them, and Mary went also to the evening\r\nservice. It was quite pleasant to see Mrs Baggett start for her slow\r\nSabbath morning walk, and to observe how her appearance altogether\r\nbelied that idea of rags and tatters which she had given as to her\r\nown wardrobe. A nicer dressed old lady, or a more becoming black silk\r\ngown, you shall not see on a Sunday morning making her way to any\r\ncountry church in England. While she was looking so pleasant and\r\ndemure,--one may say almost so handsome, in her old-fashioned and\r\napparently new bonnet,--what could have been her thoughts respecting\r\nthe red-nosed, one-legged warrior, and her intended life, to be\r\npassed in fetching two-penn\'orths of gin for him, and her endeavours\r\nto get for him a morsel of wholesome food? She had had her breakfast\r\nout of her own china tea-cup, which she used to boast was her own\r\nproperty, as it had been given to her by Mr Whittlestaff\'s mother,\r\nand had had her little drop of cream, and, to tell the truth, her\r\nboiled egg, which she always had on a Sunday morning, to enable her\r\nto listen to the long sermon of the Rev Mr Lowlad. She would talk\r\nof her hopes and her burdens, and undoubtedly she was in earnest. But\r\nshe certainly did seem to make her hay very comfortably while the sun\r\nshone.\r\n\r\nEverything on this Sunday morning was pleasant, or apparently\r\npleasant, at Croker\'s Hall. In the evening, when Mary and the\r\nmaid-servants went to church, leaving Mrs Baggett at home to look\r\nafter the house and go to sleep, Mr Whittlestaff walked off to the\r\nwooded path with his Horace. He did not read it very long. The bits\r\nwhich he did usually read never amounted to much at a time. He would\r\ntake a few lines and then digest them thoroughly, wailing over them\r\nor rejoicing, as the case might be. He was not at the present moment\r\nmuch given to joy. "Intermissa, Venus, diu rursus bella moves? Parce,\r\nprecor, precor." This was the passage to which he turned at the\r\npresent moment; and very little was the consolation which he found\r\nin it. What was so crafty, he said to himself, or so vain as that an\r\nold man should hark back to the pleasures of a time of life which was\r\npast and gone! "Non sum qualis eram," he said, and then thought with\r\nshame of the time when he had been jilted by Catherine Bailey,--the\r\ntime in which he had certainly been young enough to love and be\r\nloved, had he been as lovable as he had been prone to love. Then he\r\nput the book in his pocket. His latter effort had been to recover\r\nsomething of the sweetness of life, and not, as had been the poet\'s,\r\nto drain those dregs to the bottom. But when he got home he bade Mary\r\ntell him what Mr Lowlad had said in his sermon, and was quite cheery\r\nin his manner of picking Mr Lowlad\'s theology to pieces;--for Mr\r\nWhittlestaff did not altogether agree with Mr Lowlad as to the uses\r\nto be made of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he began to bustle about a little, as was usual\r\nwith him before he made a journey; and it did escape him, while he\r\nwas talking to Mrs Baggett about a pair of trousers which it turned\r\nout that he had given away last summer, that he meditated a journey\r\nto London on the next day.\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t a-going?" said Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t. Take my word for it, sir,--don\'t." But Mr Whittlestaff\r\nonly snubbed her, and nothing more was said about the journey at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon visitors came. Miss Evelina Hall with\r\nMiss Forrester had been driven into Alresford, and now called in\r\ncompany with Mr Blake. Mr Blake was full of his own good tidings,\r\nbut not so full but that he could remember, before he took his\r\ndeparture, to say a half whispered word on behalf of John Gordon.\r\n"What do you think, Mr Whittlestaff? Since you were at Little\r\nAlresford we\'ve settled the day."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be telling it to everybody about the county," said\r\nKattie Forrester.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I tell it to my particular friends? I am sure Miss\r\nLawrie will be delighted to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And Mr Whittlestaff also. Are you not, Mr Whittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"I am very happy to hear that a couple whom I like so well are soon\r\nto be made happy. But you have not yet told us the day."\r\n\r\n"The 1st of August," said Evelina Hall.\r\n\r\n"The 1st of August," said Mr Blake, "is an auspicious day. I am sure\r\nthere is some reason for regarding it as auspicious, though I cannot\r\nexactly remember what. It is something about Augustus, I think."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of such an idea to come from a clergyman of the Church\r\nof England," said the bride. "I declare Montagu never seems to think\r\nthat he\'s a clergyman at all."\r\n\r\n"It will be better for him," said Mr Whittlestaff, "and for all\r\nthose about him, that he should ever remember the fact and never seem\r\nto do so."\r\n\r\n"All the same," said Blake, "although the 1st of August is\r\nauspicious, I was very anxious to be married in July, only the\r\npainters said they couldn\'t be done with the house in time. One is\r\nobliged to go by what these sort of people say and do. We\'re to have\r\na month\'s honeymoon,--only just a month, because Mr Lowlad won\'t\r\nmake himself as agreeable as he ought to do about the services; and\r\nNewface, the plumber and glazier, says he can\'t have the house done\r\nas Kattie would like to live in it before the end of August. Where do\r\nyou think we\'re going to, Miss Lawrie? You would never guess."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps to Rome," said Mary at a shot.\r\n\r\n"Not quite so far. We\'re going to the Isle of Wight. It\'s rather\r\nremarkable that I never spent but one week in the Isle of Wight since\r\nI was born. We haven\'t quite made up our mind whether it\'s to be\r\nBlack Gang Chine or Ventnor. It\'s a matter of dresses, you see."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Montagu," said Miss Forrester.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is. If we decide upon Ventnor, she must have frocks and\r\nthings to come out with."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"But she\'ll want nothing of the kind at Black Gang."\r\n\r\n"Do hold your tongue, and not make an ass of yourself. What do you\r\nknow what dresses I shall want? As it is, I don\'t think I shall go\r\neither to the one place or the other. The Smiths are at Ryde, and the\r\ngirls are my great friends. I think we\'ll go to Ryde, after all."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry, Mr Whittlestaff, that we can\'t expect the pleasure\r\nof seeing you at our wedding. It is, of course, imperative that\r\nKattie should be married in the cathedral. Her father is one of the\r\ndignitaries, and could not bear not to put his best foot foremost on\r\nsuch an occasion. The Dean will be there, of course. I\'m afraid the\r\nBishop cannot come up from Farnham, because he will have friends with\r\nhim. I am afraid John Gordon will have gone by that time, or else we\r\ncertainly would have had him down. I should like John Gordon to be\r\npresent, because he would see how the kind of thing is done." The\r\nname of John Gordon at once silenced all the matrimonial chit-chat\r\nwhich was going on among them. It was manifest both to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff and to Mary that it had been lugged in without a cause,\r\nto enable Mr Blake to talk about the absent man. "It would have been\r\npleasant; eh, Kattie?"\r\n\r\n"We should have been very glad to see Mr Gordon, if it would have\r\nsuited him to come," said Miss Forrester.\r\n\r\n"It would have been just the thing for him; and we at Oxford\r\ntogether, and everything. Don\'t you think he would have liked to be\r\nthere? It would have put him in mind of other things, you know."\r\n\r\nTo this appeal there was no answer made. It was impossible that Mary\r\nshould bring herself to talk about John Gordon in mixed company.\r\nAnd the allusion to him stirred Mr Whittlestaff\'s wrath. Of course\r\nit was understood as having been spoken in Mary\'s favour. And Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had been made to perceive by what had passed at Little\r\nAlresford that the Little Alresford people all took the side of John\r\nGordon, and were supposed to be taking the side of Mary at the same\r\ntime. There was not one of them, he said to himself, that had half\r\nthe sense of Mrs Baggett. And there was a vulgarity about their\r\ninterference of which Mrs Baggett was not guilty.\r\n\r\n"He is half way on his road to the diamond-fields," said Evelina.\r\n\r\n"And went away from here on Saturday morning!" said Montagu Blake.\r\n"He has not started yet,--not dreamed of it. I heard him whisper to\r\nMr Whittlestaff about his address. He\'s to be in London at his club.\r\nI didn\'t hear him say for how long, but when a man gives his address\r\nat his club he doesn\'t mean to go away at once. I have a plan in my\r\nhead. Some of those boats go to the diamond-fields from Southampton.\r\nAll the steamers go everywhere from Southampton. Winchester is on the\r\nway to Southampton. Nothing will be easier for him than to drop in\r\nfor our marriage on his way out. That is, if he must go at last."\r\nThen he looked hard at Mary Lawrie.\r\n\r\n"And bring some of his diamonds with him," said Evelina Hall. "That\r\nwould be very nice." But not a word more was said then about John\r\nGordon by the inhabitants of Croker\'s Hall. After that the visitors\r\nwent, and Montagu Blake chaperoned the girls out of the house,\r\nwithout an idea that he had made himself disagreeable.\r\n\r\n"That young man is a most egregious ass," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"He is good-natured and simple, but I doubt whether he sees things\r\nvery plainly."\r\n\r\n"He has not an idea of what a man may talk about and when he should\r\nhold his tongue. And he is such a fool as to think that his idle\r\nchatter can influence others. I don\'t suppose a bishop can refuse to\r\nordain a gentleman because he is a general idiot. Otherwise I think\r\nthe bishop is responsible for letting in such an ass as this." Mary\r\nsaid to herself, as she heard this, that it was the most ill-natured\r\nremark which she had ever known to fall from the mouth of Mr\r\nWhittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"I think I am going away for a few days," Mr Whittlestaff said to\r\nMary, when the visitors were gone.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose I shall be in London. When one goes anywhere, it is\r\ngenerally to London; though I haven\'t been there for more than two\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"Not since I came to live with you," she said. "You are the most\r\nstay-at-home person by way of a gentleman that I ever heard of." Then\r\nthere was a pause for a few minutes, and he said nothing further.\r\n"Might a person ask what you are going for?" This she asked in the\r\nplayful manner which she knew he would take in good part.\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t quite know that a person can. I am going to see a man\r\nupon business, and if I began to tell you part of it, I must tell it\r\nall,--which would not be convenient."\r\n\r\n"May I not ask how long you will be away? There can\'t be any dreadful\r\nsecret in that. And I shall want to know what to get for your dinner\r\nwhen you come back." She was standing now at his elbow, and he was\r\nholding her by the arm. It was to him almost as though she were\r\nalready his wife, and the feeling to him was very pleasant. Only if\r\nshe were his wife, or if it were positively decided among them that\r\nshe would become so, he would certainly tell her the reason for which\r\nhe might undertake any journey. Indeed there was no reason connected\r\nwith any business of his which might not be told, other than that\r\nspecial reason which was about to take him to London. He only\r\nanswered her now by pressing her hand and smiling into her face.\r\n"Will it be for a month?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no! what should I do away from home for a month?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell? The mysterious business may require you to be absent\r\nfor a whole year. Fancy my being left at home all that time. You\r\ndon\'t think of it; but you have never left me for a single night\r\nsince you first brought me to live here."\r\n\r\n"And you have never been away."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! why should I go away? What business can a woman have to move\r\nfrom home, especially such a woman as I am."\r\n\r\n"You are just like Mrs Baggett. She always talks of women with\r\nsupreme contempt. And yet she is just as proud of herself as the\r\nqueen when you come to contradict her."\r\n\r\n"You never contradict me."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the day may come when I shall." Then he recollected himself,\r\nand added, "Or perhaps the day may never come. Never mind. Put up\r\nmy things for one week. At any rate I shall not be above a week\r\ngone." Then she left him, and went away to his room to do what was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nShe knew the business on which he was about to travel to London, as\r\nwell as though he had discussed with her the whole affair. In the\r\ncourse of the last two or three days there had been moments in which\r\nshe had declared to herself that he was cruel. There had been moments\r\nin which she had fainted almost with sorrow when she thought of the\r\nlife which fate had in store for her. There must be endless misery,\r\nwhile there might have been joy, so ecstatic in its nature as to make\r\nit seem to her to be perennial. Then she had almost fallen, and had\r\ndeclared him to be preternaturally cruel. But these moments had been\r\nshort, and had endured only while she had allowed herself to dream\r\nof the ecstatic joy, which she confessed to herself to be an unfit\r\ncondition of life for her. And then she had told herself that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff was not cruel, and that she herself was no better than a\r\nweak, poor, flighty creature unable to look in its face life and all\r\nits realities. And then she would be lost in amazement as she thought\r\nof herself and all her vacillations.\r\n\r\nShe now was resolved to take his part, and to fight his battle to\r\nthe end. When he had told her that he was going up to London, and\r\ngoing up on business as to which he could tell her nothing, she knew\r\nthat it behoved her to prevent him from taking the journey. John\r\nGordon should be allowed to go in quest of his diamonds, and Mr\r\nWhittlestaff should be persuaded not to interfere with him. It was\r\nfor her sake, and not for John Gordon\'s, that he was about to make\r\nthe journey. He had asked her whether she were willing to marry him,\r\nand she had told him that he was pressing her too hard. She would\r\ntell him now,--now before it was too late,--that this was not so. His\r\njourney to London must at any rate be prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMR AND MRS TOOKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day arranged, early on the morning after the dinner at Little\r\nAlresford Park, John Gordon went up to London. He had not been much\r\nmoved by the intimation made to him by Mr Whittlestaff that some\r\nletter should be written to him at his London address. He had made\r\nhis appeal to Mr Whittlestaff, and had received no answer whatever.\r\nAnd he had, after a fashion, made his appeal also to the girl. He\r\nfelt sure that his plea must reach her. His very presence then\r\nin this house had been an appeal to her. He knew that she so far\r\nbelieved in him as to be conscious that she could at once become\r\nhis wife--if she were willing to throw over his rival. He knew also\r\nthat she loved him,--or had certainly loved him. He did not know the\r\nnature of her regard; nor was it possible that he should ever know\r\nthat,--unless she were his wife. She had given a promise to that\r\nother man, and--it was thus he read her character--she could be\r\ntrue to her promise without any great heart-break. At any rate, she\r\nintended to be true to it. He did not for a moment suspect that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff was false. Mary had declared that she would not withdraw\r\nher word,--that only from her own mouth was to be taken her intention\r\nof such withdrawal, and that such intention she certainly would never\r\nutter. Of her character he understood much,--but not quite all. He\r\nwas not aware of the depth of her feeling. But Mr Whittlestaff he\r\ndid not understand at all. Of all those vacillating softnesses he\r\nknew nothing,--or of those moments spent with the poet, in which he\r\nwas wont to fight against the poet\'s pretences, and of those other\r\nmoments spent with Mrs Baggett, in which he would listen to, and\r\nalways finally reject, those invitations to manly strength which she\r\nwould always pour into his ears. That Mr Whittlestaff should spend\r\nhour after hour, and now day after day, in teaching himself to regard\r\nnothing but what might best suit the girl\'s happiness,--of that he\r\nwas altogether in the dark. To his thinking, Mr Whittlestaff was\r\na hard man, who, having gained his object, intended to hold fast\r\nby what he had gained. He, John Gordon, knew, or thought that he\r\nknew, that Mary, as his wife, would lead a happier life than with Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. But things had turned out unfortunately, and there was\r\nnothing for him but to return to the diamond-fields.\r\n\r\nTherefore he had gone back to London with the purpose of preparing\r\nfor his journey. A man does not start for South Africa to-morrow, or,\r\nif not to-morrow, then the next day. He was aware that there must be\r\nsome delay; but any place would be better in which to stay than the\r\nneighbourhood of Croker\'s Hall. There were things which must be done,\r\nand people with whom he must do it; but of all that, he need say\r\nnothing down at Alresford. Therefore, when he got back to London, he\r\nmeant to make all his arrangements--and did so far settle his affairs\r\nas to take a berth on board one of the mail steamers.\r\n\r\nHe had come over in company with a certain lawyer, who had gone out\r\nto Kimberley with a view to his profession, and had then, as is the\r\ncase with all the world that goes to Kimberley, gone into diamonds.\r\nDiamonds had become more to him than either briefs or pleadings. He\r\nhad been there for fifteen years, and had ruined himself and made\r\nhimself half-a-dozen times. He had found diamonds to be more pleasant\r\nthan law, and to be more compatible with champagne, tinned lobsters,\r\nand young ladies. He had married a wife, and had parted with her,\r\nand taken another man\'s wife, and paid for her with diamonds. He had\r\nthen possessed nothing, and had afterwards come forth a third-part\r\nowner of the important Stick-in-the-Mud claim, which at one time\r\nwas paying 12 per cent per month. It must be understood that the\r\nStick-in-the-Mud claim was an almost infinitesimal portion of soil\r\nin the Great Kimberley mine. It was but the sixteenth part of an\r\noriginal sub-division. But from the centre of the great basin, or\r\nrather bowl, which forms the mine, there ran up two wires to the\r\nhigh mound erected on the circumference, on which continually two\r\niron cages were travelling up and down, coming back empty, but going\r\nup laden with gemmiferous dirt. Here travelled the diamonds of\r\nthe Stick-in-the-Mud claim, the owner of one-third of which, Mr\r\nFitzwalker Tookey, had come home with John Gordon.\r\n\r\nTaking a first general glance at affairs in the diamond-fields, I\r\ndoubt whether we should have been inclined to suspect that John\r\nGordon and Fitzwalker Tookey would have been likely to come together\r\nas partners in a diamond speculation. But John Gordon had in the\r\ncourse of things become owner of the other two shares, and when\r\nFitzwalker Tookey determined to come home, he had done so with the\r\nobject of buying his partner\'s interest. This he might have done at\r\nonce,--only that he suffered under the privation of an insufficiency\r\nof means. He was a man of great intelligence, and knew well that no\r\nreadier mode to wealth had ever presented itself to him than the\r\npurchase of his partner\'s shares. Much was said to persuade John\r\nGordon; but he would not part with his documents without seeing\r\nsecurity for his money. Therefore Messrs. Gordon and Tookey put the\r\nold Stick-in-the-Mud into the hands of competent lawyers, and came\r\nhome together.\r\n\r\n"I am not at all sure that I shall sell," John Gordon had said.\r\n\r\n"But I thought that you offered it."\r\n\r\n"Yes; for money down. For the sum named I will sell now. But if I\r\nstart from here without completing the bargain, I shall keep the\r\noption in my own hands. The fact is, I do not know whether I shall\r\nremain in England or return. If I do come back I am not likely to\r\nfind anything better than the old Stick-in-the-Mud." To this Mr\r\nTookey assented, but still he resolved that he would go home. Hence\r\nit came to pass that Mr Fitzwalker Tookey was now in London, and\r\nthat John Gordon had to see him frequently. Here Tookey had found\r\nanother would-be partner, who had the needed money, and it was\r\nfervently desired by Mr Tookey that John Gordon might not go back to\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nThe two men were not at all like in their proclivities; but they had\r\nbeen thrown together, and each had learned much of the inside life of\r\nthe other. The sort of acquaintance with whom a steady man becomes\r\nintimate in such a locality often surprises the steady man himself.\r\nFitzwalker Tookey had the antecedents and education of a gentleman.\r\nChampagne and lobster suppers--the lobster coming out of tin\r\ncases,--diamonds and strange ladies, even with bloated cheeks and\r\nstrong language, had not altogether destroyed the vestiges of the\r\nTemple. He at any rate was fond of a companion with whom he could\r\ndiscuss his English regrets, and John Gordon was not inclined to shut\r\nhimself up altogether among his precious stones, and to refuse the\r\nconversation of a man who could talk. Tookey had told him of his\r\ngreat distress in reference to his wife. "By G----! you know, the\r\ncruellest thing you ever heard in the world. I was a little tight one\r\nnight, and the next morning she was off with Atkinson, who got away\r\nwith his pocket full of diamonds. Poor girl! she went down to the\r\nPortuguese settlement, and he was nabbed. He\'s doing penal service\r\nnow down at Cape Town. That\'s a kind of thing that does upset a\r\nfellow." And poor Fitzwalker began to cry.\r\n\r\nAmong such confidences Gordon allowed it to escape from him that were\r\nhe to become married in England, he did not think it probable that he\r\nshould return. Thus it was known, at least to his partner, that he\r\nwas going to look for a wife, and the desire in Mr Tookey\'s breast\r\nthat the wife might be forthcoming was intense. "Well!" he said,\r\nimmediately on Gordon\'s return to London.\r\n\r\n"What does \'well\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you went down there to look after the lady."\r\n\r\n"I have never told you so."\r\n\r\n"But you did--did you not?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you nothing about any lady, though you are constantly\r\nasking questions. As a fact, I think I shall go back next month."\r\n\r\n"To Kimberley?"\r\n\r\n"I think so. The stake I have there is of too great importance to be\r\nabandoned."\r\n\r\n"I have the money ready to pay over;--absolute cash on the nail. You\r\ndon\'t call that abandoning it?"\r\n\r\n"The claim has gone up in value 25 per cent, as you have already\r\nheard."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it has gone up a little, but not so much as that. It will come\r\ndown as much by the next mail. With diamonds you never can stick to\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. But you can only go by the prices as you see them\r\nquoted. They may be up 25 per cent again by next mail. At any rate, I\r\nam going back."\r\n\r\n"The devil you are!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s my present idea. As I like to be on the square with you\r\naltogether, I don\'t mind saying that I have booked a berth by the\r\n_Kentucky Castle_."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you have! And you won\'t take a wife with you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not aware that I shall have such an impediment."\r\n\r\nThen Fitzwalker Tookey assumed a very long face. It is difficult to\r\ntrace the workings of such a man\'s mind, or to calculate the meagre\r\nchances on which he is too often driven to base his hopes of success.\r\nHe feared that he could not show his face in Kimberley, unless as\r\nthe representative of the whole old Stick-in-the-Mud. And with that\r\nobject he had declared himself in London to have the actual power of\r\ndisposing of Gordon\'s shares. Gordon had gone down to Hampshire, and\r\nwould no doubt be successful with the young lady. At any rate,--as\r\nhe described it to himself,--he had "gone in for that." He could see\r\nhis way in that direction, but in no other. "Upon my word, this, you\r\nknow, is--what I call--rather throwing a fellow over."\r\n\r\n"I am as good as my word."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that, Gordon."\r\n\r\n"But I do, and I won\'t hear any assertion to the contrary. I offered\r\nyou the shares for a certain price, and you rejected them."\r\n\r\n"I did not do that."\r\n\r\n"You did do that,--exactly. Then there came up in my mind a feeling\r\nthat I might probably wish to change my purpose."\r\n\r\n"And I am to suffer for that."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I then told you that you should still have the\r\nshares for the price named. But I did not offer them to any one else.\r\nSo I came home,--and you chose to come with me. But before I started,\r\nand again after, I told you that the offer did not hold good, and\r\nthat I should not make up my mind as to selling till after I got to\r\nEngland."\r\n\r\n"We understood that you meant to be married."\r\n\r\n"I never said so. I never said a word about marriage. I am now going\r\nback, and mean to manage the mine myself."\r\n\r\n"Without asking me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall ask you. But I have two-thirds. I will give you for\r\nyour share 10 per cent more than the price you offered me for each of\r\nmy shares. If you do not like that, you need not accept the offer;\r\nbut I don\'t mean to have any more words about it."\r\n\r\nMr Fitzwalker Tookey\'s face became longer and longer, and he did in\r\ntruth feel himself to be much aggrieved within his very soul. There\r\nwere still two lines of conduct open to him. He might move the stern\r\nman by a recapitulation of the sorrow of his circumstances, or he\r\nmight burst out into passionate wrath, and lay all his ruin to his\r\npartner\'s doing. He might still hope that in this latter way he could\r\nrouse all Kimberley against Gordon, and thus creep back into some\r\nvestige of property under the shadow of Gordon\'s iniquities. He would\r\ntry both. He would first endeavour to move the stern man to pity. "I\r\ndon\'t think you can imagine the condition in which you are about to\r\nplace me."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t admit that I am placing you anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll just explain. Of course I know that I can tell you everything\r\nin strictest confidence."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know it at all."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I can. You remember the story of my poor wife?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I remember."\r\n\r\n"She\'s in London now."\r\n\r\n"What! She got back from the Portuguese settlement?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She did not stay there long. I don\'t suppose that the\r\nPortuguese are very nice people."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not."\r\n\r\n"At any rate they don\'t have much money among them."\r\n\r\n"Not after the lavish expenditure of the diamond-fields," suggested\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\n"Just so. Poor Matilda had been accustomed to all that money could\r\nbuy for her. I never used to be close-fisted with her, though\r\nsometimes I would be tight."\r\n\r\n"As far as I could understand, you never used to agree at all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we did hit it off. Perhaps it was my fault."\r\n\r\n"You used to be a little free in your way of living."\r\n\r\n"I was. I confess that I was so. I was young then, but I am older\r\nnow. I haven\'t touched a B. and S. before eleven o\'clock since I have\r\nbeen in London above two or three times. I do mean to do the best I\r\ncan for my young family." It was the fact that Mr Tookey had three\r\nlittle children boarding out in Kimberley.\r\n\r\n"And what is the lady doing in London?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, she\'s at my lodgings."\r\n\r\n"Oh--h!"\r\n\r\n"I do admit it. She is."\r\n\r\n"She is indifferent to the gentleman in the Cape Town penal\r\nsettlement?"\r\n\r\n"Altogether, I don\'t think she ever really cared for him. To tell the\r\ntruth, she only wanted some one to take her away from--me."\r\n\r\n"And now she trusts you again?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes;--completely. She is my wife, you know, still."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"That sacred tie has never been severed. You must always remember\r\nthat. I don\'t know what your feelings are on such a subject, but\r\naccording to my views it should not be severed roughly. When there\r\nare children, that should always be borne in mind. Don\'t you think\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"The children should be borne in mind."\r\n\r\n"Just so. That\'s what I mean. Who can look after a family of young\r\nchildren so well as their young mother? Men have various ways of\r\nlooking at the matter." To this John Gordon gave his ready consent,\r\nand was anxious to hear in what way his assistance was to be asked\r\nin again putting Mr and Mrs Tookey, with their young children,\r\nrespectably on their feet. "There are men, you know, stand-off sort\r\nof fellows, who think that a woman should never be forgiven."\r\n\r\n"It must depend on how far the husband has been in fault."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Now these stand-off sort of fellows will never admit that\r\nthey have been in fault at all. That\'s not my case."\r\n\r\n"You drank a little."\r\n\r\n"For the matter of that, so did she. When a woman drinks she gets\r\nherself to bed somehow. A man gets out upon a spree. That\'s what I\r\nused to do, and then I would hit about me rather recklessly. I have\r\nno doubt Matilda did get it sometimes. When there has been that kind\r\nof thing, forgive and forget is the best thing you can do."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"And then at the Fields there isn\'t the same sort of prudish life\r\nwhich one is accustomed to in England. Here in London a man is\r\nnowhere if he takes his wife back. Nobody knows her, because there\r\nare plenty to know of another sort. But there things are not quite\r\nso strict. Of course she oughtn\'t to have gone off with Atkinson;--a\r\nvulgar low fellow, too."\r\n\r\n"And you oughtn\'t to have licked her."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. It was tit for tat, I think. That\'s the way I look\r\nat it. At any rate we are living together now, and no one can say\r\nwe\'re not man and wife."\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be a deal of trouble saved in that way."\r\n\r\n"A great deal. We are man and wife, and can begin again as though\r\nnothing had happened. No one can say that black\'s the white of our\r\neye. She\'ll take to those darling children as though nothing had\r\nhappened. You can\'t conceive how anxious she is to get back to them.\r\nAnd there\'s no other impediment. That\'s a comfort."\r\n\r\n"Another impediment would have upset you rather?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t have put up with that." Mr Fitzwalker Tookey looked very\r\ngrave and high-minded as he made the assertion. "But there\'s nothing\r\nof that kind. It\'s all open sailing. Now,--what are we to live upon,\r\njust for a beginning?"\r\n\r\n"You have means out there."\r\n\r\n"Not as things are at present,--I am sorry to say. To tell the truth,\r\nmy third share of the old Stick-in-the-Mud is gone. I had to raise\r\nmoney when it was desirable that I should come with you."\r\n\r\n"Not on my account."\r\n\r\n"And then I did owe something. At any rate, it\'s all gone now. I\r\nshould find myself stranded at Kimberley without a red cent."\r\n\r\n"What can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--I will explain. Poker & Hodge will buy your shares for the\r\nsum named. Joshua Poker, who is out there, has got my third share.\r\nPoker & Hodge have the money down, and when I have arranged the sale,\r\nwill undertake to give me the agency at one per cent on the whole\r\ntake for three years certain. That\'ll be L1000 a-year, and it\'s odd\r\nif I can\'t float myself again in that time." Gordon stood silent,\r\nscratching his head. "Or if you\'d give me the agency on the same\r\nterms, it would be the same thing. I don\'t care a straw for Poker &\r\nHodge."\r\n\r\n"I daresay not."\r\n\r\n"But you\'d find me as true as steel."\r\n\r\n"What little good I did at the Fields I did by looking after my own\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Then what do you propose? Let Poker & Hodge have them, and I shall\r\nbless you for ever." To this mild appeal Mr Tookey had been brought\r\nby the manner in which John Gordon had scratched his head. "I think\r\nyou are bound to do it, you know." To this he was brought by the\r\nsubsequent look which appeared in John Gordon\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Men will say so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a straw what men say, or women."\r\n\r\n"And you to come back in the same ship with me and my wife! You\r\ncouldn\'t do it. The Fields wouldn\'t receive you." Gordon bethought\r\nhimself whether this imagined rejection might not arise rather from\r\nthe character of his travelling companions. "To bring back the\r\nmother of three little sainted babes, and then to walk in upon every\r\nshilling of property which had belonged to their father! You never\r\ncould hold up your head in Kimberley again."\r\n\r\n"I should have to stand abashed before your virtue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you would. I should be known to have come back with my poor\r\nrepentant wife,--the mother of three dear babes. And she would be\r\nknown to have returned with her misguided husband. The humanity of\r\nthe Fields would not utter a word of reproval to either of us. But,\r\nupon my word, I should not like to stand in your shoes. And how you\r\ncould sit opposite to her and look her in the face on the journey\r\nout, I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"It would be unpleasant."\r\n\r\n"Deuced unpleasant, I should say. You remember the old Roman saying,\r\n\'Never be conscious of anything within your own bosom.\' Only think\r\nhow you would feel when you were swelling it about in Kimberley,\r\nwhile that poor lady won\'t be able to buy a pair of boots for herself\r\nor her children. I say nothing about myself. I didn\'t think you were\r\nthe man to do it;--I didn\'t indeed."\r\n\r\nGordon did find himself moved by the diversity of lights through\r\nwhich he was made to look at the circumstances in question. In the\r\nfirst place, there was the journey back with Mr Tookey and his wife,\r\ncompanions he had not anticipated. The lady would probably begin by\r\nsoliciting his intimacy, which on board ship he could hardly refuse.\r\nWith a fellow-passenger, whose husband has been your partner, you\r\nmust quarrel bitterly or be warm friends. Upon the whole, he thought\r\nthat he could not travel to South Africa with Mr and Mrs Fitzwalker\r\nTookey. And then he understood what the man\'s tongue would do if he\r\nwere there for a month in advance. The whole picture of life, too,\r\nat the Fields was not made attractive by Mr Tookey\'s description.\r\nHe was not afraid of the reception which might be accorded to Mrs\r\nTookey, but saw that Tookey found himself able to threaten him with\r\nviolent evils, simply because he would claim his own. Then there shot\r\nacross his brain some reminiscence of Mary Lawrie, and a comparison\r\nbetween her and her life and the sort of life which a man must lead\r\nunder the auspices of Mrs Tookey. Mary Lawrie was altogether beyond\r\nhis reach; but it would be better to have her to think of than the\r\nother to know. His idea of the diamond-fields was disturbed by the\r\npromised return of his late partner and his wife.\r\n\r\n"And you mean to reduce me to this misery?" asked Mr Tookey.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a straw for your misery."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"Not for your picture of your misery. I do not doubt but that when\r\nyou have been there for a month you will be drunk as often as ever,\r\nand just as free with your fists when a woman comes in your way."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"And I do not see that I am at all bound to provide for you and for\r\nyour wife and children. You have seen many ups and downs, and will be\r\ndoomed to see many more, as long as you can get hold of a bottle of\r\nwine."\r\n\r\n"I mean to take the pledge,--I do indeed. I must do it gradually,\r\nbecause of my constitution,--but I shall do it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t in the least believe in it;--nor do I believe in any man\r\nwho thinks to redeem himself after such a fashion. It may still be\r\npossible that I shall not go back."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!"\r\n\r\n"I may kill beasts in Buenos Ayres, or take a tea-farm in Thibet, or\r\njoin the colonists in Tennessee. In that case I will let you know\r\nwhat arrangement I may propose to make about the Kimberley claim. At\r\nany rate, I may say this,--I shall not go back in the same vessel\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"I thought it would have been so comfortable."\r\n\r\n"You and Mrs Tookey would find yourself more at your ease without\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. Don\'t let that thought disturb you. Whatever\r\nmisery fate may have in store for me, you will always find that, for\r\nthe hour, I will endeavour to be a good companion. \'Sufficient for\r\nthe day is the evil thereof.\' That is the first of my mottoes."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I shall not go back in the _Kentucky Castle_ if you\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid our money is paid."\r\n\r\n"So is mine; but that does not signify. You have a week yet, and I\r\nwill let you know by eleven o\'clock on Thursday what steps I shall\r\nfinally take. If in any way I can serve you, I will do so; but I can\r\nadmit no claim."\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks! And I am so glad you approve of what I have done\r\nabout Matilda. I\'m sure that a steady-going fellow like you would\r\nhave done the same." To this John Gordon could make no answer, but\r\nleft his friend, and went away about his own business. He had to\r\ndecide between Tennessee, Thibet, and Buenos Ayres, and wanted his\r\ntime for his own purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to dinner at his club, he found a letter from Mr\r\nWhittlestaff, which had come by the day-mail. It was a letter which,\r\nfor the time, drove Thibet and Buenos Ayres, and Tennessee also,\r\nclean out of his mind. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   CROKER\'S HALL, -- June 188--.\r\n\r\n   DEAR MR JOHN GORDON,--I shall be in town this afternoon,\r\n   probably by the same train which will bring this letter,\r\n   and will do myself the honour of calling upon you at your\r\n   club the next day at twelve.--I am, dear Mr John Gordon,\r\n   faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n   WILLIAM WHITTLESTAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there was to be an answer to the appeal which he had made. Of\r\nwhat nature would be the answer? As he laid his hand upon his heart,\r\nand felt the violence of the emotion to which he was subjected, he\r\ncould not doubt the strength of his own love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF\'S JOURNEY DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that if I were you I would go up to London, Mr\r\nWhittlestaff," said Mary. This was on the Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I would."\r\n\r\n"Why should you interfere?"\r\n\r\n"I know I ought not to interfere."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you ought. Especially as I have taken the trouble to\r\nconceal what I am going about."\r\n\r\n"I can guess," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"You ought not to guess in such a matter. You ought not to have it on\r\nyour mind at all. I told you that I would not tell you. I shall go.\r\nThat\'s all that I have got to say."\r\n\r\nThe words with which he spoke were ill-natured and savage. The reader\r\nwill find them to be so, if he thinks of them. They were such that\r\na father would hardly speak, under any circumstances, to a grown-up\r\ndaughter,--much less that a lover would address to his mistress. And\r\nMary was at present filling both capacities. She had been taken into\r\nhis house almost as an adopted daughter, and had, since that time,\r\nhad all the privileges accorded to her. She had now been promoted\r\nstill higher, and had become his affianced bride. That the man should\r\nhave turned upon her thus, in answer to her counsel, was savage, or\r\nat least ungracious. But at every word her heart became fuller and\r\nmore full of an affection as for something almost divine. What other\r\nman had ever shown such love for any woman? and this love was shown\r\nto her,--who was nothing to him,--who ate the bread of charity in his\r\nhouse. And it amounted to this, that he intended to give her up to\r\nanother man,--he who had given such proof of his love,--he, of whom\r\nshe knew that this was a question of almost life and death,--because\r\nin looking into his face she had met there the truth of his heart!\r\nSince that first avowal, made before Gordon had come,--made at a\r\nmoment when some such avowal from her was necessary,--she had spoken\r\nno word as to John Gordon. She had endeavoured to show no sign. She\r\nhad given herself up to her elder lover, and had endeavoured to\r\nhave it understood that she had not intended to transfer herself\r\nbecause the other man had come across her path again like a flash of\r\nlightning. She had dined in company with her younger lover without\r\nexchanging a word with him. She had not allowed her eyes to fall upon\r\nhim more than she could help, lest some expression of tenderness\r\nshould be seen there. Not a word of hope had fallen from her lips\r\nwhen they had first met, because she had given herself to another.\r\nShe was sure of herself in that. No doubt there had come moments in\r\nwhich she had hoped--nay, almost expected--that the elder of the two\r\nmight give her up; and when she had felt sure that it was not to be\r\nso, her very soul had rebelled against him. But as she had taken\r\ntime to think of it, she had absolved him, and had turned her anger\r\nagainst herself. Whatever he wanted,--that she believed it would be\r\nher duty to do for him, as far as its achievement might be in her\r\npower.\r\n\r\nShe came round and put her arm upon him, and looked into his face.\r\n"Don\'t go to London. I ask you not to go."\r\n\r\n"Why should I not go?"\r\n\r\n"To oblige me. You pretend to have a secret, and refuse to say why\r\nyou are going. Of course I know."\r\n\r\n"I have written a letter to say that I am coming."\r\n\r\n"It is still lying on the hall-table down-stairs. It will not go to\r\nthe post till you have decided."\r\n\r\n"Who has dared to stop it?"\r\n\r\n"I have. I have dared to stop it. I shall dare to put it in the fire\r\nand burn it. Don\'t go! He is entitled to nothing. You are entitled\r\nto have,--whatever it is that you may want, though it is but such a\r\ntrifle."\r\n\r\n"A trifle, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. A woman has a little gleam of prettiness about her,--though\r\nhere it is but of a common order."\r\n\r\n"Anything so uncommon I never came near before."\r\n\r\n"Let that pass; whether common or uncommon, it matters nothing. It is\r\nsomething soft, which will soon pass away, and of itself can do no\r\ngood. It is contemptible."\r\n\r\n"You are just Mrs Baggett over again."\r\n\r\n"Very well; I am quite satisfied. Mrs Baggett is a good woman. She\r\ncan do something beyond lying on a sofa and reading novels, while her\r\ngood looks fade away. It is simply because a woman is pretty and weak\r\nthat she is made so much of, and is encouraged to neglect her duties.\r\nBy God\'s help I will not neglect mine. Do not go to London."\r\n\r\nHe seemed as though he hesitated as he sat there under the spell\r\nof her little hand upon his shoulder. And in truth he did hesitate.\r\nCould it not be that he should be allowed to sit there all his days,\r\nand have her hand about his neck somewhat after this fashion? Was\r\nhe bound to give it all up? What was it that ordinary selfishness\r\nallowed? What depth of self-indulgence amounted to a wickedness which\r\na man could not permit himself to enjoy without absolutely hating\r\nhimself? It would be easy in this case to have all that he wanted. He\r\nneed not send the letter. He need not take this wretched journey to\r\nLondon. Looking forward, as he thought that he could look, judging\r\nfrom the girl\'s character, he believed that he would have all that he\r\ndesired,--all that a gracious God could give him,--if he would make\r\nher the recognised partner of his bed and his board. Then would he be\r\nproud when men should see what sort of a wife he had got for himself\r\nat last in place of Catherine Bailey. And why should she not love\r\nhim? Did not all her words tend to show that there was love?\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly there came a frown across his face, as she stood\r\nlooking at him. She was getting to know the manner of that frown. Now\r\nshe stooped down to kiss it away from his brow. It was a brave thing\r\nto do; but she did it with a consciousness of her courage. "Now I may\r\nburn the letter," she said, as though she were about to depart upon\r\nthe errand.\r\n\r\n"No, by heaven!" he said. "Let me have a sandwich and a glass of\r\nwine, for I shall start in an hour."\r\n\r\nWith a glance of his thoughts he had answered all those questions.\r\nHe had taught himself what ordinary selfishness allowed. Ordinary\r\nselfishness,--such selfishness as that of which he would have\r\npermitted himself the indulgence,--must have allowed him to disregard\r\nthe misery of John Gordon, and to keep the girl to himself. As\r\nfar as John Gordon was concerned, he would not have cared for his\r\nsufferings. He was as much to himself,--or more,--than could be\r\nJohn Gordon. He did not love John Gordon, and could have doomed him\r\nto tearing his hair,--not without regret, but at any rate without\r\nremorse. He had settled that question. But with Mary Lawrie there\r\nmust be a never-dying pang of self-accusation, were he to take her\r\nto his arms while her love was settled elsewhere. It was not that he\r\nfeared her for himself, but that he feared himself for her sake. God\r\nhad filled his heart with love of the girl,--and, if it was love,\r\ncould it be that he would destroy her future for the gratification\r\nof his own feelings? "I tell you it is no good," he said, as she\r\ncrouched down beside him, almost sitting on his knee.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs Baggett came into the room, detecting Mary almost\r\nin the embrace of her old master. "He\'s come back again, sir," said\r\nMrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"Who has come back?"\r\n\r\n"The Sergeant."\r\n\r\n"Then you may tell him to go about his business. He is not wanted, at\r\nany rate. You are to remain here, and have your own way, like an old\r\nfool."\r\n\r\n"I am that, sir."\r\n\r\n"There is not any one coming to interfere with you."\r\n\r\n"Sir!"\r\n\r\nThen Mary got up, and stood sobbing at the open window. "At any rate,\r\nyou\'ll have to remain here to look after the house, even if I go\r\naway. Where is the Sergeant?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the stable again."\r\n\r\n"What! drunk?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; he\'s not drunk. I think his wooden leg is affected sooner\r\nthan if he had two like mine, or yours, sir. And he did manage to go\r\nin of his self, now that he knows the way. He\'s there among the hay,\r\nand I do think it\'s very unkind of Hayonotes to say as he\'ll spoil\r\nit. But how am I to get him out, unless I goes away with him?"\r\n\r\n"Let him stay there and give him some dinner. I don\'t know what else\r\nyou\'ve to do."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t stay always,--in course, sir. As Hayonotes says,--what\'s he\r\nto do with a wooden-legged sergeant in his stable as a permanence? I\r\nhad come to say I was to go home with him."\r\n\r\n"You\'re to do nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"What is it you mean, then, about my taking care of the house?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind. When I want you to know, I shall tell you." Then\r\nMrs Baggett bobbed her head three times in the direction of Mary\r\nLawrie\'s back, as though to ask some question whether the leaving the\r\nhouse might not be in reference to Mary\'s marriage. But she feared\r\nthat it was not made in reference to Mr Whittlestaff\'s marriage\r\nalso. What had her master meant when he had said that there was no\r\none coming to interfere with her, Mrs Baggett? "You needn\'t ask any\r\nquestions just at present, Mrs Baggett," he said.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean as you are going up to London just to give her up to\r\nthat young fellow?"\r\n\r\n"I am going about my own business, and I won\'t be inquired into,"\r\nsaid Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re going to do what no man ought to do."\r\n\r\n"You are an impertinent old woman," said her master.\r\n\r\n"I daresay I am. All the same, it\'s my duty to tell you my mind. You\r\ncan\'t eat me, Mr Whittlestaff, and it wouldn\'t much matter if you\r\ncould. When you\'ve said that you\'ll do a thing, you ought not to go\r\nback for any other man, let him be who it may,--especially not in\r\nrespect of a female. It\'s weak, and nobody wouldn\'t think a straw of\r\nyou for doing it. It\'s some idea of being generous that you have got\r\ninto your head. There ain\'t no real generosity in it. I say it ain\'t\r\nmanly, and that\'s what a man ought to be."\r\n\r\nMary, though she was standing at the window, pretending to look out\r\nof it, knew that during the whole of this conversation Mrs Baggett\r\nwas making signs at her,--as though indicating an opinion that she\r\nwas the person in fault. It was as though Mrs Baggett had said that\r\nit was for her sake,--to do something to gratify her,--that Mr\r\nWhittlestaff was about to go to London. She knew that she at any\r\nrate was not to blame. She was struggling for the same end as Mrs\r\nBaggett, and did deserve better treatment. "You oughtn\'t to bother\r\ngoing up to London, sir, on any such errand, and so I tells you, Mr\r\nWhittlestaff," said Mrs Baggett.\r\n\r\n"I have told him the same thing myself," said Mary Lawrie, turning\r\nround.\r\n\r\n"If you told him as though you meant it, he wouldn\'t go," said Mrs\r\nBaggett.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know about it," said Mr Whittlestaff. "Now the fact\r\nis, I won\'t stand this kind of thing. If you mean to remain here, you\r\nmust be less free with your tongue."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to remain here, Mr Whittlestaff. It\'s just that as I\'m\r\ncoming to. There\'s Timothy Baggett is down there among the hosses,\r\nand he says as I am to go with him. So I\'ve come up here to say\r\nthat if he\'s allowed to sleep it off to-day, I\'ll be ready to start\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I tell you I am not going to make any change at all," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"You was saying you was going away,--for the honeymoon, I did\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"A man may go away if he pleases, without any reason of that kind.\r\nOh dear, oh dear, that letter is not gone! I insist that that letter\r\nshould go. I suppose I must see about it myself." Then when he\r\nbegan to move, the women moved also. Mary went to look after the\r\nsandwiches, and Mrs Baggett to despatch the letter. In ten minutes\r\nthe letter was gone, and half an hour afterwards Mr Whittlestaff had\r\nhimself driven down to the station.\r\n\r\n"What is it he means, Miss?" said Mrs Baggett, when the master was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Mary, who was in truth very angry with the old\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"He wants to make you Mrs Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"In whatever he wants I shall obey him,--if I only knew how."\r\n\r\n"It\'s what you is bound to do, Miss Mary. Think of what he has done\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n"I require no one to tell me that."\r\n\r\n"What did Mr Gordon come here for, disturbing everybody? Nobody\r\nasked him;--at least, I suppose nobody asked him." There was an\r\ninsinuation in this which Mary found it hard to bear. But it was\r\nbetter to bear it than to argue on such a point with the servant.\r\n"And he said things which put the master about terribly."\r\n\r\n"It was not my doing."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s a man as needn\'t have his own way. Why should Mr Gordon\r\nhave everything just as he likes it? I never heard tell of Mr Gordon\r\ntill he came here the other day. I don\'t think so much of Mr Gordon\r\nmyself." To this Mary, of course, made no answer. "He\'s no business\r\ndisturbing people when he\'s not sent for. I can\'t abide to see Mr\r\nWhittlestaff put about in this way. I have known him longer than you\r\nhave."\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a man that\'ll be driven pretty nigh out of his mind if he\'s\r\ndisappointed." Then there was silence, as Mary was determined not to\r\ndiscuss the matter any further. "If you come to that, you needn\'t\r\nmarry no one unless you pleases." Mary was still silent. "They\r\nshouldn\'t make me marry them unless I was that way minded. I can\'t\r\nabide such doings," the old woman again went on after a pause. "I\r\nknows what I knows, and I sees what I sees."\r\n\r\n"What do you know?" said Mary, driven beyond her powers of silence.\r\n\r\n"The meaning is, that Mr Whittlestaff is to be disappointed after\r\nhe have received a promise. Didn\'t he have a promise?" To this Mrs\r\nBaggett got no reply, though she waited for one before she went on\r\nwith her argument. "You knows he had; and a promise between a lady\r\nand gentleman ought to be as good as the law of the land. You stand\r\nthere as dumb as grim death, and won\'t say a word, and yet it all\r\ndepends upon you. Why is it to go about among everybody, that he\'s\r\nnot to get a wife just because a man\'s come home with his pockets\r\nfull of diamonds? It\'s that that people\'ll say; and they\'ll say that\r\nyou went back from your word just because of a few precious stones.\r\nI wouldn\'t like to have it said of me anyhow."\r\n\r\nThis was very hard to bear, but Mary found herself compelled to\r\nbear it. She had determined not to be led into an argument with Mrs\r\nBaggett on the subject, feeling that even to discuss her conduct\r\nwould be an impropriety. She was strong in her own conduct, and knew\r\nhow utterly at variance it had been with all that this woman imputed\r\nto her. The glitter of the diamonds had been merely thrown in by Mrs\r\nBaggett in her passion. Mary did not think that any one would be so\r\nbase as to believe such an accusation as that. It would be said of\r\nher that her own young lover had come back suddenly, and that she had\r\npreferred him to the gentleman to whom she was tied by so many bonds.\r\nIt would be said that she had given herself to him and had then taken\r\nback the gift, because the young lover had come across her path. And\r\nit would be told also that there had been no word of promise given to\r\nthis young lover. All that would be very bad, without any allusion\r\nto a wealth of diamonds. It would not be said that, before she had\r\npledged herself to Mr Whittlestaff, she had pleaded her affection\r\nfor her young lover, when she had known nothing even of his present\r\nexistence. It would not be known that though there had been no\r\nlover\'s vows between her and John Gordon, there had yet been on both\r\nsides that unspoken love which could not have been strengthened by\r\nany vows. Against all that she must guard herself, without thinking\r\nof the diamonds. She had endeavoured to guard herself, and she had\r\nthought also of the contentment of the man who had been so good to\r\nher. She had declared to herself that of herself she would think not\r\nat all. And she had determined also that all the likings,--nay, the\r\naffection of John Gordon himself,--should weigh not at all with her.\r\nShe had to decide between the two men, and she had decided that both\r\nhonesty and gratitude required her to comply with the wishes of the\r\nelder. She had done all that she could with that object, and was it\r\nher fault that Mr Whittlestaff had read the secret of her heart, and\r\nhad determined to give way before it? This had so touched her that it\r\nmight almost be said that she knew not to which of her two suitors\r\nher heart belonged. All this, if stated in answer to Mrs Baggett\'s\r\naccusations, would certainly exonerate herself from the stigma thrown\r\nupon her, but to Mrs Baggett she could not repeat the explanation.\r\n\r\n"It nigh drives me wild," said Mrs Baggett. "I don\'t suppose you\r\never heard of Catherine Bailey?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t a-going to tell you. It\'s a romance as shall be wrapped\r\ninside my own bosom. It was quite a tragedy,--was Catherine Bailey;\r\nand one as would stir your heart up if you was to hear it. Catherine\r\nBailey was a young woman. But I\'m not going to tell you the\r\nstory;--only that she was no more fit for Mr Whittlestaff than any\r\nof them stupid young girls that walks about the streets gaping in at\r\nthe shop-windows in Alresford. I do you the justice, Miss Lawrie, to\r\nsay as you are such a female as he ought to look after."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs Baggett."\r\n\r\n"But she led him into such trouble, because his heart is soft, as\r\nwas dreadful to look at. He is one of them as always wants a wife.\r\nWhy didn\'t he get one before? you\'ll say. Because till you came in\r\nthe way he was always thinking of Catherine Bailey. Mrs Compas she\r\nbecome. \'Drat her and her babies!\' I often said to myself. What was\r\nCompas? No more than an Old Bailey lawyer;--not fit to be looked at\r\nalongside of our Mr Whittlestaff. No more ain\'t Mr John Gordon, to\r\nmy thinking. You think of all that, Miss Mary, and make up your mind\r\nwhether you\'ll break his heart after giving a promise. Heart-breaking\r\nain\'t to him what it is to John Gordon and the likes of him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMR WHITTLESTAFF TAKES HIS JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff did at last get into the train and have himself\r\ncarried up to London. And he ate his sandwiches and drank his sherry\r\nwith an air of supreme satisfaction,--as though he had carried his\r\npoint. And so he had. He had made up his mind on a certain matter;\r\nand, with the object of doing a certain piece of work, he had escaped\r\nfrom the two dominant women of his household, who had done their\r\nbest to intercept him. So far his triumph was complete. But as he\r\nsat silent in the corner of the carriage, his mind reverted to\r\nthe purpose of his journey, and he cannot be said to have been\r\ntriumphant. He knew it all as well as did Mrs Baggett. And he knew\r\ntoo that, except Mrs Baggett and the girl herself, all the world was\r\nagainst him. That ass Montagu Blake every time he opened his mouth\r\nas to his own bride let out the idea that John Gordon should have\r\nhis bride because John Gordon was young and lusty, and because he,\r\nWhittlestaff, might be regarded as an old man. The Miss Halls were\r\naltogether of the same opinion, and were not slow to express it. All\r\nAlresford would know it, and would sympathise with John Gordon. And\r\nas it came to be known that he himself had given up the girl whom\r\nhe loved, he could read the ridicule which would be conveyed by the\r\nsmiles of his neighbours.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth of Mr Whittlestaff, he was a man very open to such\r\nshafts of ridicule. The "_robur et aes triplex_" which fortified his\r\nheart went only to the doing of a good and unselfish action, and did\r\nnot extend to providing him with that adamantine shield which virtue\r\nshould of itself supply. He was as pervious to these stings as a man\r\nmight be who had not strength to act in opposition to them. He could\r\nscrew himself up to the doing of a great deed for the benefit of\r\nanother, and could as he was doing so deplore with inward tears\r\nthe punishment which the world would accord to him for the deed.\r\nAs he sat there in the corner of his carriage, he was thinking\r\nof the punishment rather than of the glory. And the punishment\r\nmust certainly come now. It would be a punishment lasting for the\r\nremainder of his life, and so bitter in its kind as to make any\r\nfurther living almost impossible to him. It was not that he would\r\nkill himself. He did not meditate any such step as that. He was a\r\nman who considered that by doing an outrage to God\'s work an offence\r\nwould be committed against God which admitted of no repentance. He\r\nmust live through it to the last. But he must live as a man who was\r\ndegraded. He had made his effort, but his effort would be known to\r\nall Alresford. Mr Montagu Blake would take care of that.\r\n\r\nThe evil done to him would be one which would admit of no complaint\r\nfrom his own mouth. He would be left alone, living with Mrs\r\nBaggett,--who of course knew all the facts. The idea of Mrs Baggett\r\ngoing away with her husband was of course not to be thought of. That\r\nwas another nuisance, a small evil in comparison with the great\r\nmisfortune of his life.\r\n\r\nHe had brought this girl home to his house to be the companion of his\r\ndays, and she had come to have in his mouth a flavour, as it were,\r\nand sweetness beyond all other sweetnesses. She had lent a grace\r\nto his days of which for many years he had not believed them to be\r\ncapable. He was a man who had thought much of love, reading about it\r\nin all the poets with whose lines he was conversant. He was one who,\r\nin all that he read, would take the gist of it home to himself, and\r\nask himself how it was with him in that matter. His favourite Horace\r\nhad had a fresh love for every day; but he had told himself that\r\nHorace knew nothing of love. Of Petrarch and Laura he had thought;\r\nbut even to Petrarch Laura had been a subject for expression rather\r\nthan for passion. Prince Arthur, in his love for Guinevere, went\r\nnearer to the mark which he had fancied for himself. Imogen, in her\r\nlove for Posthumus, gave to him a picture of all that love should be.\r\nIt was thus that he had thought of himself in all his readings; and\r\nas years had gone by, he had told himself that for him there was to\r\nbe nothing better than reading. But yet his mind had been full, and\r\nhe had still thought to himself that, in spite of his mistake in\r\nreference to Catherine Bailey, there was still room for a strong\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nThen Mary Lawrie had come upon him, and the sun seemed to shine\r\nnowhere but in her eyes and in the expression of her face. He had\r\ntold himself distinctly that he was now in love, and that his life\r\nhad not gone so far forward as to leave him stranded on the dry\r\nsandhills. She was there living in his house, subject to his orders,\r\naffectionate and docile; but, as far as he could judge, a perfect\r\nwoman. And, as far as he could judge, there was no other man whom she\r\nloved. Then, with many doubtings, he asked her the question, and he\r\nsoon learned the truth,--but not the whole truth.\r\n\r\nThere had been a man, but he was one who seemed to have passed by and\r\nleft his mark, and then to have gone on altogether out of sight. She\r\nhad told him that she could not but think of John Gordon, but that\r\nthat was all. She would, if he asked it, plight her troth to him\r\nand become his wife, although she must think of John Gordon. This\r\nthinking would last but for a while, he told himself; and he at his\r\nage--what right had he to expect aught better than that? She was\r\nof such a nature that, when she had given herself up in marriage,\r\nshe would surely learn to love her husband. So he had accepted her\r\npromise, and allowed himself for one hour to be a happy man.\r\n\r\nThen John Gordon had come to his house, falling upon it like the\r\nblast of a storm. He had come at once--instantly--as though fate had\r\nintended to punish him, Whittlestaff, utterly and instantly. Mary had\r\ntold him that she could not promise not to think of him who had once\r\nloved her, when, lo and behold! the man himself was there. Who ever\r\nsuffered a blow so severe as this? He had left them together. He\r\nhad felt himself compelled to do so by the exigencies of the moment.\r\nIt was impossible that he should give either one or the other to\r\nunderstand that they would not be allowed to meet in his house. They\r\nhad met, and Mary had been very firm. For a few hours there had\r\nexisted in his bosom the feeling that even yet he might be preferred.\r\n\r\nBut gradually that feeling had disappeared, and the truth had come\r\nhome to him. She was as much in love with John Gordon as could any\r\ngirl be with the man whom she adored. And the other rock on which he\r\nhad depended was gradually shivered beneath his feet. He had fancied\r\nat first that the man had come back, as do so many adventurers,\r\nwithout the means of making a woman happy. It was not for John Gordon\r\nthat he was solicitous, but for Mary Lawrie. If John Gordon were a\r\npauper, or so nearly so as to be able to offer Mary no home, then it\r\nwould clearly be his duty not to allow the marriage. In such case the\r\nresult to him would be, if not heavenly, sweet enough at any rate to\r\nsatisfy his longings. She would come to him, and John Gordon would\r\ndepart to London, and to the world beyond, and there would be an end\r\nof him. But it became palpable to his senses generally that the man\'s\r\nfortunes had not been such as this. And then there came home to him a\r\nfeeling that were they so, it would be his duty to make up for Mary\'s\r\nsake what was wanting,--since he had discovered of what calibre was\r\nthe man himself.\r\n\r\nIt was at Mr Hall\'s house that the idea had first presented itself\r\nto him with all the firmness of a settled project. It would be, he\r\nhad said to himself, a great thing for a man to do. What, after all,\r\nis the meaning of love, but that a man should do his best to serve\r\nthe woman he loves? "Who cares a straw for him?" he said to himself,\r\nas though to exempt himself from any idea of general charity, and to\r\nprove that all the good which he intended to do was to be done for\r\nlove alone. "Not a straw; whether he shall stay at home here and\r\nhave all that is sweetest in the world, or be sent out alone to find\r\nfresh diamonds amidst the dirt and misery of that horrid place, is as\r\nnothing, as far as he is concerned. I am, at any rate, more to myself\r\nthan John Gordon. I do not believe in doing a kindness of such a\r\nnature as that to such a one. But for her--! And I could not hold her\r\nto my bosom, knowing that she would so much rather be in the arms of\r\nanother man." All this he said to himself; but he said it in words\r\nfully formed, and with the thoughts, on which the words were based,\r\nclearly established.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the end of his journey, he had himself driven to\r\nthe hotel, and ordered his dinner, and ate it in solitude, still\r\nsupported by the ecstasy of his thoughts. He knew that there was\r\nbefore him a sharp cruel punishment, and then a weary lonely life.\r\nThere could be no happiness, no satisfaction, in store for him. He\r\nwas aware that it must be so; but still for the present there was a\r\njoy to him in thinking that he would make her happy, and in that he\r\nwas determined to take what immediate delight it would give him. He\r\nasked himself how long that delight could last; and he told himself\r\nthat when John Gordon should have once taken her by the hand and\r\nclaimed her as his own, the time of his misery would have come.\r\n\r\nThere had hung about him a dream, clinging to him up to the moment of\r\nhis hotel dinner, by which he had thought it possible that he might\r\nyet escape from the misery of Pandemonium and be carried into the\r\nlight and joy of Paradise. But as he sat with his beef-steak before\r\nhim, and ate his accustomed potato, with apparently as good a gusto\r\nas any of his neighbours, the dream departed. He told himself\r\nthat under no circumstances should the dream be allowed to become\r\na reality. The dream had been of this wise. With all the best\r\nintentions in his power he would offer the girl to John Gordon, and\r\nthen, not doubting Gordon\'s acceptance of her, would make the same\r\noffer to the girl herself. But what if the girl refused to accept\r\nthe offer? What if the girl should stubbornly adhere to her original\r\npromise? Was he to refuse to marry her when she should insist that\r\nsuch was her right? Was he to decline to enter in upon the joys of\r\nParadise when Paradise should be thus opened to him? He would do his\r\nbest, loyally and sincerely, with his whole heart. But he could not\r\nforce her to make him a wretch, miserable for the rest of his life!\r\n\r\nIn fact it was she who might choose to make the sacrifice, and thus\r\nsave him from the unhappiness in store for him. Such had been the\r\nnature of his dream. As he was eating his beef-steak and potatoes,\r\nhe told himself that it could not be so, and that the dream must be\r\nflung to the winds. A certain amount of strength was now demanded of\r\nhim, and he thought that he would be able to use it. "No, my dear,\r\nnot me; it may not be that you should become my wife, though all the\r\npromises under heaven had been given. Though you say that you wish\r\nit, it is a lie which may not be ratified. Though you implore it of\r\nme, it cannot be granted. It is he that is your love, and it is he\r\nthat must have you. I love you too, God in his wisdom knows, but it\r\ncannot be so. Go and be his wife, for mine you shall never become. I\r\nhave meant well, but have been unfortunate. Now you know the state of\r\nmy mind, than which nothing is more fixed on this earth." It was thus\r\nthat he would speak to her, and then he would turn away; and the term\r\nof his misery would have commenced.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he got up and prepared for his interview with\r\nJohn Gordon. He walked up and down the sward of the Green Park,\r\nthinking to himself of the language which he would use. If he could\r\nonly tell the man that he hated him while he surrendered to him the\r\ngirl whom he loved so dearly, it would be well. For in truth there\r\nwas nothing of Christian charity in his heart towards John Gordon.\r\nBut he thought at last that it would be better that he should\r\nannounce his purpose in the simplest language. He could hate the man\r\nin his own heart as thoroughly as he desired. But it would not be\r\nbecoming in him, were he on such an occasion to attempt to rise to\r\nthe romance of tragedy. "It will be all the same a thousand years\r\nhence," he said to himself as he walked in at the club door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe asked whether Mr John Gordon was within, and in two minutes\r\nfound himself standing in the hall with that hero of romance. Mr\r\nWhittlestaff told himself, as he looked at the man, that he was such\r\na hero as ought to be happy in his love. Whereas of himself, he was\r\nconscious of a personal appearance which no girl could be expected\r\nto adore. He thought too much of his personal appearance generally,\r\ncomplaining to himself that it was mean; whereas in regard to Mary\r\nLawrie, it may be said that no such idea had ever entered her mind.\r\n"It was just because he had come first," she would have said if\r\nasked. And the "he" alluded to would have been John Gordon. "He\r\nhad come first, and therefore I had learned to love him." It was\r\nthus that Mary Lawrie would have spoken. But Mr Whittlestaff, as he\r\nlooked up into John Gordon\'s face, felt that he himself was mean.\r\n\r\n"You got my letter, Mr Gordon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I got it last night."\r\n\r\n"I have come up to London, because there is something that I want\r\nto say to you. It is something that I can\'t very well put up into a\r\nletter, and therefore I have taken the trouble to come to town." As\r\nhe said this he endeavoured, no doubt, to assert his own dignity by\r\nthe look which he assumed. Nor did he intend that Mr Gordon should\r\nknow anything of the struggle which he had endured.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Gordon knew as well what Mr Whittlestaff had to say as did\r\nMr Whittlestaff himself. He had turned the matter over in his own\r\nmind since the letter had reached him, and was aware that there could\r\nbe no other cause for seeing him which could bring Mr Whittlestaff\r\nup to London. But a few days since he had made an appeal to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff--an appeal which certainly might require much thought\r\nfor its answer--and here was Mr Whittlestaff with his reply. It\r\ncould not have been made quicker. It was thus that John Gordon had\r\nthought of it as he had turned Mr Whittlestaff\'s letter over in his\r\nmind. The appeal had been made readily enough. The making of it had\r\nbeen easy; the words to be spoken had come quickly, and without the\r\nnecessity for a moment\'s premeditation. He had known it all, and from\r\na full heart the mouth speaks. But was it to have been expected that\r\na man so placed as had been Mr Whittlestaff, should be able to give\r\nhis reply with equal celerity? He, John Gordon, had seen at once\r\non reaching Croker\'s Hall the state in which things were. Almost\r\nhopelessly he had made his appeal to the man who had her promise.\r\nThen he had met the man at Mr Hall\'s house, and hardly a word had\r\npassed between them. What word could have been expected? Montagu\r\nBlake, with all his folly, had judged rightly in bringing them\r\ntogether. When he received the letter, John Gordon had remembered\r\nthat last word which Mr Whittlestaff had spoken to him in the\r\nsquire\'s hall. He had thought of the appeal, and had resolved to\r\ngive an answer to it. It was an appeal which required an answer. He\r\nhad turned it over in his mind, and had at last told himself what\r\nthe answer should be. John Gordon had discovered all that when he\r\nreceived the letter, and it need hardly be said that his feelings\r\nin regard to Mr Whittlestaff were very much kinder than those of Mr\r\nWhittlestaff to him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you wouldn\'t mind coming out into the street," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. "I can\'t say very well what I\'ve got to say in here."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Gordon; "I will go anywhere."\r\n\r\n"Let us go into the Park. It is green there, and there is some shade\r\namong the trees." Then they went out of the club into Pall Mall, and\r\nMr Whittlestaff walked on ahead without a word. "No; we will not go\r\ndown there," he said, as he passed the entrance into St. James\'s Park\r\nby Marlborough House, and led the way through St. James\'s Palace into\r\nthe Green Park. "We\'ll go on till we come to the trees; there are\r\nseats there, unless the people have occupied them all. One can\'t talk\r\nhere under the blazing sun;--at least I can\'t." Then he walked on\r\nat a rapid pace, wiping his brow as he did so. "Yes, there\'s a seat.\r\nI\'ll be hanged if that man isn\'t going to sit down upon it! What\r\na beast he is! No, I can\'t sit down on a seat that another man is\r\noccupying. I don\'t want any one to hear what I\'ve got to say. There!\r\nTwo women have gone a little farther on." Then he hurried to the\r\nvacant bench and took possession of it. It was placed among the thick\r\ntrees which give a perfect shade on the north side of the Park, and\r\nhad Mr Whittlestaff searched all London through, he could not have\r\nfound a more pleasant spot in which to make his communication. "This\r\nwill do," said he.\r\n\r\n"Very nicely indeed," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t talk about absolutely private business in the hall of the\r\nclub, you know."\r\n\r\n"I could have taken you into a private room, Mr Whittlestaff, had\r\nyou wished it."\r\n\r\n"With everybody coming in and out, just as they pleased. I don\'t\r\nbelieve in private rooms in London clubs. What I\'ve got to say can be\r\nsaid better _sub dio_. I suppose you know what it is that I\'ve got to\r\ntalk about."\r\n\r\n"Hardly," said John Gordon. "But that is not exactly true. I think I\r\nknow, but I am not quite sure of it. On such a subject I should not\r\nlike to make a surmise unless I were confident."\r\n\r\n"It\'s about Miss Lawrie."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"What makes you suppose that?" said Whittlestaff, sharply.\r\n\r\n"You told me that you were sure I should know."\r\n\r\n"So I am, quite sure. You came all the way down to Alresford to see\r\nher. If you spoke the truth, you came all the way home from the\r\ndiamond-fields with the same object."\r\n\r\n"I certainly spoke the truth, Mr Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the good of your pretending not to know?"\r\n\r\n"I have not pretended. I merely said that I could not presume to\r\nput the young lady\'s name into your mouth until you had uttered it\r\nyourself. There could be no other subject of conversation between you\r\nand me of which I was aware."\r\n\r\n"You had spoken to me about her," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"No doubt I had. When I found that you had given her a home, and had\r\nmade yourself, as it were, a father to her--"\r\n\r\n"I had not made myself her father,--nor yet her mother. I had loved\r\nher, as you profess to do."\r\n\r\n"My profession is at any rate true."\r\n\r\n"I daresay. You may or you mayn\'t; I at any rate know nothing about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why otherwise should I have come home and left my business in South\r\nAfrica? I think you may take it for granted that I love her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care twopence whether you do or don\'t," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. "It\'s nothing to me whom you love. I should have been\r\ninclined to say at first sight that a man groping in the dirt for\r\ndiamonds wouldn\'t love any one. And even if you did, though you might\r\nbreak your heart and die, it would be nothing to me. Had you done so,\r\nI should not have heard of you, nor should I have wished to hear of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThere was an incivility in all this of which John Gordon felt that he\r\nwas obliged to take some notice. There was a want of courtesy in the\r\nman\'s manner rather than his words, which he could not quite pass by,\r\nalthough he was most anxious to do so. "I daresay not," said he; "but\r\nhere I am and here also is Miss Lawrie. I had said what I had to say\r\ndown at Alresford, and of course it is for you now to decide what is\r\nto be done. I have never supposed that you would care personally for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be so conceited about yourself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I am," said Gordon;--"except that a man cannot but\r\nbe a little conceited who has won the love of Mary Lawrie."\r\n\r\n"You think it impossible that I should have done so."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I did it before you had seen her. Though I may be\r\nconceited, I am not more conceited for myself than you are for\r\nyourself. Had I not known her, you would probably have engaged her\r\naffections. I had known her, and you are aware of the result. But it\r\nis for you to decide. Miss Lawrie thinks that she owes you a debt\r\nwhich she is bound to pay if you exact it."\r\n\r\n"Exact it!" exclaimed Mr Whittlestaff. "There is no question of\r\nexacting!" John Gordon shrugged his shoulders. "I say there is no\r\nquestion of exacting. The words should not have been used. She has my\r\nfull permission to choose as she may think fit, and she knows that\r\nshe has it. What right have you to speak to me of exacting?"\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff had now talked himself into such a passion, and was\r\napparently so angry at the word which his companion had used, that\r\nJohn Gordon began to doubt whether he did in truth know the purpose\r\nfor which the man had come to London. Could it be that he had made\r\nthe journey merely with the object of asserting that he had the power\r\nof making this girl his wife, and of proving his power by marrying\r\nher. "What is it that you wish, Mr Whittlestaff?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Wish! What business have you to ask after my wishes? But you know\r\nwhat my wishes are very well. I will not pretend to keep them in the\r\ndark. She came to my house, and I soon learned to desire that she\r\nshould be my wife. If I know what love is, I loved her. If I know\r\nwhat love is, I do love her still. She is all the world to me. I have\r\nno diamonds to care for; I have no rich mines to occupy my heart;\r\nI am not eager in the pursuit of wealth. I had lived a melancholy,\r\nlonely life till this young woman had come to my table,--till I\r\nhad felt her sweet hand upon mine,--till she had hovered around me,\r\ncovering everything with bright sunshine. Then I asked her to be my\r\nwife;--and she told me of you."\r\n\r\n"She told you of me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; she told me of you--of you who might then have been dead, for\r\naught she knew. And when I pressed her, she said that she would think\r\nof you always."\r\n\r\n"She said so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that she would think of you always. But she did not say that\r\nshe would always love you. And in the same breath she promised to be\r\nmy wife. I was contented,--and yet not quite contented. Why should\r\nshe think of you always? But I believed that it would not be so. I\r\nthought that if I were good to her, I should overcome her. I knew\r\nthat I should be better to her than you would be."\r\n\r\n"Why should I not be good to her?"\r\n\r\n"There is an old saying of a young man\'s slave and an old man\'s\r\ndarling. She would at any rate have been my darling. It might be that\r\nshe would have been your slave."\r\n\r\n"My fellow-workman in all things."\r\n\r\n"You think so now; but the man always becomes the master. If you\r\ngrovelled in the earth for diamonds, she would have to look for them\r\namidst the mud and slime."\r\n\r\n"I have never dreamed of taking her to the diamond-fields."\r\n\r\n"It would have been so in all other pursuits."\r\n\r\n"She would have had none that she had not chosen," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"How am I to know that? How am I to rest assured that the world would\r\nbe smooth to her if she were your creature? I am not assured--I do\r\nnot know."\r\n\r\n"Who can tell, as you say? Can I promise her a succession of joys if\r\nshe be my wife? She is not one who will be likely to look for such a\r\nlife as that. She will know that she must take the rough and smooth\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"There would have been no rough with me," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"I do not believe in such a life," said John Gordon. "A woman should\r\nnot wear a stuff gown always; but the silk finery and the stuff gown\r\nshould follow each other. To my taste, the more there may be of the\r\nstuff gown and the less of the finery, the more it will be to my\r\nwishes."\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of her gowns. It is not of such things as those\r\nthat I am thinking." Here Mr Whittlestaff got up from the bench, and\r\nbegan walking rapidly backwards and forwards under the imperfect\r\nshade on the path. "You will beat her."\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Beat her in the spirit. You will domineer over her, and desire to\r\nhave your own way. When she is toiling for you, you will frown at\r\nher. Because you have business on hand, or perhaps pleasure, you will\r\nleave her in solitude. There may a time come when the diamonds shall\r\nhave all gone."\r\n\r\n"If she is to be mine, that time will have come already. The diamonds\r\nwill be sold. Did you ever see a diamond in my possession? Why do you\r\ntwit me with diamonds? If I had been a coal-owner, should I have been\r\nexpected to keep my coals?"\r\n\r\n"These things stick to the very soul of a man. They are a poison\r\nof which he cannot rid himself. They are like gambling. They make\r\neverything cheap that should be dear, and everything dear that should\r\nbe cheap. I trust them not at all,--and I do not trust you, because\r\nyou deal in them."\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I shall not deal in them. But, Mr Whittlestaff, I\r\nmust tell you that you are unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"No doubt. I am a poor miserable man who does not know the world. I\r\nhave never been to the diamond-fields. Of course I understand nothing\r\nof the charms of speculation. A quiet life with my book is all that I\r\ncare for;--with just one other thing, one other thing. You begrudge\r\nme that."\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff, it does not signify a straw what I begrudge you."\r\nMr Whittlestaff had now come close to him, and was listening to him.\r\n"Nor, as I take it, what you begrudge me. Before I left England she\r\nand I had learned to love each other. It is so still. For the sake of\r\nher happiness, do you mean to let me have her?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"You do?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. You have known it all along. Of course I do. Do you\r\nthink I would make her miserable? Would it be in my bosom to make her\r\ncome and live with a stupid, silly old man, to potter on from day to\r\nday without any excitement? Would I force her into a groove in which\r\nher days would be wretched to her? Had she come to me and wanted\r\nbread, and have seen before her all the misery of poverty, the\r\nstone-coldness of a governess\'s life; had she been left to earn her\r\nbread without any one to love her, it might then have been different.\r\nShe would have looked out into another world, and have seen another\r\nprospect. A comfortable home with kindness, and her needs supplied,\r\nwould have sufficed. She would then have thought herself happy in\r\nbecoming my wife. There would then have been no cruelty. But she\r\nhad seen you, and though it was but a dream, she thought that she\r\ncould endure to wait. Better that than surrender all the delight of\r\nloving. So she told me that she would think of you. Poor dear! I can\r\nunderstand now the struggle which she intended to make. Then in the\r\nvery nick of time, in the absolute moment of the day--so that you\r\nmight have everything and I nothing--you came. You came, and were\r\nallowed to see her, and told her all your story. You filled her heart\r\nfull with joy, but only to be crushed when she thought that the fatal\r\npromise had been given to me. I saw it all, I knew it. I thought to\r\nmyself for a few hours that it might be so. But it cannot be so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff!"\r\n\r\n"It cannot be so," he said, with a firm determined voice, as though\r\nasserting a fact which admitted no doubt.\r\n\r\n"Mr Whittlestaff, what am I to say to you?"\r\n\r\n"You! What are you to say? Nothing. What should you say? Why should\r\nyou speak? It is not for love of you that I would do this thing; nor\r\nyet altogether from love of her. Not that I would not do much for her\r\nsake. I almost think that I would do it entirely for her sake, if\r\nthere were no other reason. But to shame myself by taking that which\r\nbelongs to another, as though it were my own property! To live a\r\ncoward in mine own esteem! Though I may be the laughing-stock and\r\nthe butt of all those around me, I would still be a man to myself. I\r\nought to have felt that it was sufficient when she told me that some\r\nof her thoughts must still be given to you. She is yours, Mr Gordon;\r\nbut I doubt much whether you care for the possession."\r\n\r\n"Not care for her! Up to the moment when I received your note, I was\r\nabout to start again for South Africa. South Africa is no place for\r\nher,--nor for me either, with such a wife. Mr Whittlestaff, will you\r\nnot allow me to say one word to you in friendship?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"How am I to come and take her out of your house?"\r\n\r\n"She must manage it as best she can. But no; I would not turn her\r\nfrom my door for all the world could do for me. This, too, will be\r\npart of the punishment that I must bear. You can settle the day\r\nbetween you, I suppose, and then you can come down; and, after the\r\naccustomed fashion, you can meet her at the church-door. Then you can\r\ncome to my house, and eat your breakfast there if you will. You will\r\nsee fine things prepared for you,--such as a woman wants on those\r\noccasions,--and then you can carry her off wherever you please. I\r\nneed know nothing of your whereabouts. Good morning now. Do not say\r\nanything further, but let me go my way."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORDON WRITES A LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they parted in the park, Mr Whittlestaff trudged off to his own\r\nhotel, through the heat and sunshine. He walked quickly, and never\r\nlooked behind him, and went as though he had fully accomplished his\r\nobject in one direction, and must hurry to get it done in another. To\r\nGordon he had left no directions whatever. Was he to be allowed to go\r\ndown to Mary, or even to write her a letter? He did not know whether\r\nMary had ever been told of this wonderful sacrifice which had been\r\nmade on her behalf. He understood that he was to have his own way,\r\nand was to be permitted to regard himself as betrothed to her, but\r\nhe did not at all understand what steps he was to take in the matter,\r\nexcept that he was not to go again to the diamond-fields. But Mr\r\nWhittlestaff hurried himself off to his hotel, and shut himself up in\r\nhis own bedroom,--and when there, he sobbed, alas! like a child.\r\n\r\nThe wife whom he had won for himself was probably more valuable to\r\nhim than if he had simply found her disengaged and ready to jump into\r\nhis arms. She, at any rate, had behaved well. Mr Whittlestaff had no\r\ndoubt proved himself to be an angel, perfect all round,--such a man\r\nas you shall not meet perhaps once in your life. But Mary, too, had\r\nso behaved as to enhance the love of any man who had been already\r\nengaged to her. As he thought of the whole story of the past week,\r\nthe first idea that occurred to him was that he certainly had been\r\npresent to her mind during the whole period of his absence. Though\r\nnot a word had passed between them, and though no word of absolute\r\nlove for each other had even been spoken before, she had been steady\r\nto him, with no actual basis on which to found her love. He had\r\nknown, and she had been sure, and therefore she had been true to him.\r\nOf course, being a true man himself, he worshipped her all the more.\r\nMr Whittlestaff was absolutely, undoubtedly perfect; but in Gordon\'s\r\nestimation Mary was not far off perfection. But what was he to do\r\nnow, so that he might approach her?\r\n\r\nHe had pledged himself to one thing, and he must at once go to work\r\nand busy himself in accomplishing it. He had promised not to return\r\nto Africa; and he must at once see Mr Tookey, and learn whether that\r\ngentleman\'s friends would be allowed to go on with the purchase as\r\narranged. He knew Poker & Hodge to be moneyed men, or to be men, at\r\nany rate, in command of money. If they would not pay him at once,\r\nhe must look elsewhere for buyers; but the matter must be settled.\r\nTookey had promised to come to his club this day, and there he would\r\ngo and await his coming.\r\n\r\nHe went to his club, but the first person who came to him was\r\nMr Whittlestaff. Mr Whittlestaff when he had left the park had\r\ndetermined never to see John Gordon again, or to see him only during\r\nthat ceremony of the marriage, which it might be that he would even\r\nyet escape. All that was still in the distant future. Dim ideas as to\r\nsome means of avoiding it flitted through his brain. But even though\r\nhe might see Gordon on that terrible occasion, he need not speak\r\nto him. And it would have to be done then, and then only. But now\r\nanother idea, certainly very vague, had found its way into his mind,\r\nand with the object of carrying it out, Mr Whittlestaff had come to\r\nthe club. "Oh, Mr Whittlestaff, how do you do again?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m much the same as I was before, thank you. There hasn\'t happened\r\nanything to improve my health."\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing may happen to injure it."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t much matter. You said something about some property\r\nyou\'ve got in diamonds, and you said once that you must go out to\r\nlook after it."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not going now. I shall sell my share in the mines. I am\r\ngoing to see a Mr Tookey about it immediately."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you sell them to me?"\r\n\r\n"The diamond shares,--to you!"\r\n\r\n"Why not to me? If the thing has to be done at once, of course you\r\nand I must trust each other. I suppose you can trust me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I can."\r\n\r\n"As I don\'t care much about it, whether I get what I buy or not, it\r\ndoes not much matter for me. But in truth, in such an affair as this\r\nI would trust you. Why should not I go in your place?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you are the man who ought to go there."\r\n\r\n"I am too old? I\'m not a cripple, if you mean that. I don\'t see why I\r\nshouldn\'t go to the diamond-fields as well as a younger man."\r\n\r\n"It is not about your age, Mr Whittlestaff; but I do not think you\r\nwould be happy there."\r\n\r\n"Happy! I do not know that my state of bliss here is very great. If I\r\nhad bought your shares, as you call them, and paid money for them, I\r\ndon\'t see why my happiness need stand in the way."\r\n\r\n"You are a gentleman, Mr Whittlestaff."\r\n\r\n"Well; I hope so."\r\n\r\n"And of that kind that you would have your eyes picked out of your\r\nhead before you had been there a week. Don\'t go. Take my word for it,\r\nthat life will be pleasanter to you here than there, and that for you\r\nthe venture would be altogether dangerous. Here is Mr Tookey." At\r\nthis point of the conversation, Mr Tookey entered the hall-door, and\r\nsome fashion of introduction took place between the two strangers.\r\nJohn Gordon led the way into a private room, and the two others\r\nfollowed him. "Here\'s a gentleman anxious to buy my shares, Tookey,"\r\nsaid Gordon.\r\n\r\n"What! the whole lot of the old Stick-in-the-Mud? He\'ll have to\r\nshell down some money in order to do that! If I were to be asked my\r\nopinion, I should say that the transaction was hardly one in the\r\ngentleman\'s way of business."\r\n\r\n"I suppose an honest man may work at it," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the honestest business I know out," said Fitzwalker Tookey;\r\n"but it does require a gentleman to have his eyes about him."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I got my eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh certainly, certainly," said Tookey; "I never knew a gentleman\r\nhave them brighter. But there are eyes and eyes. Here\'s Mr Gordon\r\ndid have a stroke of luck out there;--quite wonderful! But because he\r\ntumbled on to a good thing, it\'s no reason that others should. And\r\nhe\'s sold his claim already, if he doesn\'t go himself,--either to me,\r\nor else to Poker & Hodge."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it is so," said John Gordon.\r\n\r\n"There\'s my darling wife, who is going out with me, and who means\r\nto stand all the hardship of the hard work amidst those scenes of\r\nconstant labour,--a lady who is dying to see her babies there. I am\r\nsure, sir, that Mr Gordon won\'t forget his promises to me and my\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"If you have the money ready."\r\n\r\n"There is Mr Poker in a hansom cab outside, and ready to go with you\r\nto the bank at once, as the matter is rather pressing. If you will\r\ncome with him, he will explain everything. I will follow in another\r\ncab, and then everything can be completed." John Gordon did make an\r\nappointment to meet Mr Poker in the city later on in the day, and\r\nthen was left together with Mr Whittlestaff at the club.\r\n\r\nIt was soon decided that Mr Whittlestaff should give up all idea of\r\nthe diamond-fields, and in so doing he allowed himself to be brought\r\nback to a state of semi-courteous conversation with his happy rival.\r\n"Well, yes; you may write to her, I suppose. Indeed I don\'t know\r\nwhat right I have to say that you may, or you mayn\'t. She\'s more\r\nyours than mine, I suppose." "Turn her out! I don\'t know what makes\r\nyou take such an idea as that in your head." John Gordon had not\r\nsuggested that Mr Whittlestaff would turn Mary Lawrie out,--though\r\nhe had spoken of the steps he would have to take were he to find\r\nMary left without a home. "She shall have my house as her own till\r\nshe can find another. As she will not be my wife, she shall be my\r\ndaughter,--till she is somebody else\'s wife." "I told you before that\r\nyou may come and marry her. Indeed I can\'t help myself. Of course\r\nyou may go on as you would with some other girl;--only I wish it\r\nwere some other girl. You can go and stay with Montagu Blake, if you\r\nplease. It is nothing to me. Everybody knows it now." Then he did say\r\ngood-bye, though he could not be persuaded to shake hands with John\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nMr Whittlestaff did not go home that day, but on the next, remaining\r\nin town till he was driven out of it by twenty-four hours of absolute\r\nmisery. He had said to himself that he would remain till he could\r\nthink of some future plan of life that should have in it some better\r\npromise of success for him than his sudden scheme of going to the\r\ndiamond-fields. But there was no other plan which became practicable\r\nin his eyes. On the afternoon of the very next day London was no\r\nlonger bearable to him; and as there was no other place but Croker\'s\r\nHall to which he could take himself with any prospect of meeting\r\nfriends who would know anything of his ways of life, he did go down\r\non the following day. One consequence of this was, that Mary had\r\nreceived from her lover the letter which he had written almost as\r\nsoon as he had received Mr Whittlestaff\'s permission to write. The\r\nletter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MARY,--I do not know whether you are surprised by\r\n   what Mr Whittlestaff has done; but I am,--so much so that\r\n   I hardly know how to write to you on the matter. If you\r\n   will think of it, I have never written to you, and have\r\n   never been in a position in which writing seemed to be\r\n   possible. Nor do I know as yet whether you are aware of\r\n   the business which has brought Mr Whittlestaff to town.\r\n\r\n   I suppose I am to take it for granted that all that he\r\n   tells me is true; though when I think what it is that I\r\n   have to accept,--and that on the word of a man who is not\r\n   your father, and who is a perfect stranger to me,--it does\r\n   seem as though I were assuming a great deal. And yet it is\r\n   no more than I asked him to do for me when I saw him at\r\n   his own house.\r\n\r\n   I had no time then to ask for your permission; nor, had\r\n   I asked for it, would you have granted it to me. You had\r\n   pledged yourself, and would not have broken your pledge.\r\n   If I asked for your hand at all, it was from him that I\r\n   had to ask. How will it be with me if you shall refuse to\r\n   come to me at his bidding?\r\n\r\n   I have never told you that I loved you, nor have you\r\n   expressed your willingness to receive my love. Dear Mary,\r\n   how shall it be? No doubt I do count upon you in my very\r\n   heart as being my own. After this week of troubles it\r\n   seems as though I can look back upon a former time in\r\n   which you and I had talked to one another as though we had\r\n   been lovers. May I not think that it was so? May it not be\r\n   so? May I not call you my Mary?\r\n\r\n   And indeed between man and man, as I would say, only that\r\n   you are not a man, have I not a right to assume that it\r\n   is so? I told him that it was so down at Croker\'s Hall,\r\n   and he did not contradict me. And now he has been the most\r\n   indiscreet of men, and has allowed all your secrets to\r\n   escape from his breast. He has told me that you love me,\r\n   and has bade me do as seems good to me in speaking to you\r\n   of my love.\r\n\r\n   But, Mary, why should there be any mock modesty or\r\n   pretence between us? When a man and woman mean to become\r\n   husband and wife, they should at any rate be earnest in\r\n   their profession. I am sure of my love for you, and of my\r\n   earnest longing to make you my wife. Tell me;--am I not\r\n   right in counting upon you for wishing the same thing?\r\n\r\n   What shall I say in writing to you of Mr Whittlestaff? To\r\n   me personally he assumes the language of an enemy. But he\r\n   contrives to do so in such a way that I can take it only\r\n   as the expression of his regret that I should be found to\r\n   be standing in his way. His devotion to you is the most\r\n   beautiful expression of self-abnegation that I have ever\r\n   met. He tells me that nothing is done for me; but it is\r\n   only that I may understand how much more is done for you.\r\n   Next to me,--yes, Mary, next to myself, he should be the\r\n   dearest to you of human beings. I am jealous already,\r\n   almost jealous of his goodness. Would that I could look\r\n   forward to a life in which I would be regarded as his\r\n   friend.\r\n\r\n   Let me have a line from you to say that it is as I would\r\n   wish it, and name a day in which I may come to visit you.\r\n   I shall now remain in London only to obey your behests. As\r\n   to my future life, I can settle nothing till I can discuss\r\n   it with you, as it will be your life also. God bless you,\r\n   my own one.--Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n   JOHN GORDON.\r\n\r\n   We are not to return to the diamond-fields. I have\r\n   promised Mr Whittlestaff that it shall be so.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary, when she received this letter, retired into her own room to\r\nread it. For indeed her life in public,--her life, that is, to which\r\nMrs Baggett had access,--had been in some degree disturbed since the\r\ndeparture of the master of the house. Mrs Baggett certainly proved\r\nherself to be a most unreasonable old woman. She praised Mary Lawrie\r\nup to the sky as being the only woman fitted to be her master\'s wife,\r\nat the same time abusing Mary for driving her out of the house were\r\nthe marriage to take place; and then abusing her also because Mr\r\nWhittlestaff had gone to town to look up another lover on Mary\'s\r\nbehalf. "It isn\'t my fault; I did not send him," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"You could make his going of no account. You needn\'t have the young\r\nman when he comes back. He has come here, disturbing us all with his\r\ndiamonds, in a most objectionable manner."\r\n\r\n"You would be able to remain here and not have to go away with that\r\ndreadfully drunken old man." This Mary had said, because there had\r\nbeen rather a violent scene with the one-legged hero in the stable.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to do with it? Baggett ain\'t the worst man in the world\r\nby any means. If he was a little cross last night, he ain\'t so\r\nalways. You\'d be cross yourself, Miss, if you didn\'t get straw enough\r\nunder you to take off the hardness of the stones."\r\n\r\n"But you would go and live with him."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t he my husband! Why shouldn\'t a woman live with her husband?\r\nAnd what does it matter where I live, or how. You ain\'t going to\r\nmarry John Gordon, I know, to save me from Timothy Baggett!" Then\r\nthe letter had come--the letter from Mary\'s lover; and Mary retired\r\nto her own room to read it. The letter she thought was perfect, but\r\nnot so perfect as was Mr Whittlestaff. When she had read the letter,\r\nalthough she had pressed it to her bosom and kissed it a score of\r\ntimes, although she had declared that it was the letter of one who\r\nwas from head to foot a man, still there was room for that jealousy\r\nof which John Gordon had spoken. When Mary had said to herself\r\nthat he was of all human beings surely the best, it was to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff and not to John Gordon that she made allusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nAGAIN AT CROKER\'S HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three o\'clock on that day Mr Whittlestaff came home. The\r\npony-carriage had gone to meet him, but Mary remained purposely out\r\nof the way. She could not rush out to greet him, as she would have\r\ndone had his absence been occasioned by any other cause. But he had\r\nno sooner taken his place in the library than he sent for her. He had\r\nbeen thinking about it all the way down from London, and had in some\r\nsort prepared his words. During the next half hour he did promise\r\nhimself some pleasure, after that his life was to be altogether a\r\nblank to him. He would go. To that only had he made up his mind. He\r\nwould tell Mary that she should be happy. He would make Mrs Baggett\r\nunderstand that for the sake of his property she must remain at\r\nCroker\'s Hall for some period to which he would decline to name an\r\nend. And then he would go.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary," he said, smiling, "so I have got back safe."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I see you have got back."\r\n\r\n"I saw a friend of yours when I was up in London."\r\n\r\n"I have had a letter, you know, from Mr Gordon."\r\n\r\n"He has written, has he? Then he has been very sudden."\r\n\r\n"He said he had your leave to write."\r\n\r\n"That is true. He had. I thought that, perhaps, he would have taken\r\nmore time to think about it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he knew what he had to say," said Mary. And then she\r\nblushed, as though fearing that she had appeared to have been quite\r\nsure that her lover would not have been so dull.\r\n\r\n"I daresay."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t quite mean that I knew."\r\n\r\n"But you did."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff! But I will not attempt to deceive you. If you\r\nleft it to him, he would know what to say,--immediately."\r\n\r\n"No doubt! No doubt!"\r\n\r\n"When he had come here all the way from South Africa on purpose to\r\nsee me, as he said, of course he would know. Why should there be any\r\npretence on my part?"\r\n\r\n"Why, indeed?"\r\n\r\n"But I have not answered him;--not as yet."\r\n\r\n"There need be no delay."\r\n\r\n"I would not do it till you had come. I may have known what he would\r\nsay to me, but I may be much in doubt what I should say to him."\r\n\r\n"You may say what you like." He answered her crossly, and she\r\nheard the tone. But he was aware of it also, and felt that he was\r\ndisgracing himself. There was none of the half-hour of joy which\r\nhe had promised himself. He had struggled so hard to give her\r\neverything, and he might, at any rate, have perfected his gift with\r\ngood humour. "You know you have my full permission," he said, with a\r\nsmile. But he was aware that this smile was not pleasant,--was not\r\nsuch a smile as would make her happy. But it did not signify. When he\r\nwas gone away, utterly abolished, then she would be happy.\r\n\r\n"I do not know that I want your permission."\r\n\r\n"No, no; I daresay not."\r\n\r\n"You asked me to be your wife."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did."\r\n\r\n"And I accepted you. The matter was settled then."\r\n\r\n"But you told me of him,--even at first. And you said that you would\r\nalways think of him."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I told you what I knew to be true. But I accepted you; and I\r\ndetermined to love you with all my heart,--with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"And you knew that you would love him without any determination."\r\n\r\n"I think that I have myself under more control. I think that in\r\ntime,--in a little time,--I would have done my duty by you\r\nperfectly."\r\n\r\n"As how?"\r\n\r\n"Loving you with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"And now?" It was a hard question to put to her, and so unnecessary!\r\n"And now?"\r\n\r\n"You have distrusted me somewhat. I begged you not to go to London. I\r\nbegged you not to go."\r\n\r\n"You cannot love two men." She looked into his face, as though\r\nimploring him to spare her. For though she did know what was\r\ncoming,--though had she asked herself, she would have said that she\r\nknew,--yet she felt herself bound to disown Mr Gordon as her very\r\nown while Mr Whittlestaff thus tantalised her. "No; you cannot love\r\ntwo men. You would have tried to love me and have failed. You would\r\nhave tried not to love him, and have failed then also."\r\n\r\n"Then I would not have failed. Had you remained here, and have taken\r\nme, I should certainly not have failed then."\r\n\r\n"I have made it easy for you, my dear;--very easy. Write your letter.\r\nMake it as loving as you please. Write as I would have had you write\r\nto me, could it have been possible. O, Mary! that ought to have been\r\nmy own! O, Mary! that would have made beautiful for me my future\r\ndownward steps! But it is not for such a purpose that a young life\r\nsuch as yours should be given. Though he should be unkind to you,\r\nthough money should be scarce with you, though the ordinary troubles\r\nof the world should come upon you, they will be better for you than\r\nthe ease I might have prepared for you. It will be nearer to human\r\nnature. I, at any rate, shall be here if troubles come; or if I am\r\ngone, that will remain which relieves troubles. You can go now and\r\nwrite your letter."\r\n\r\nShe could not speak a word as she left the room. It was not only\r\nthat her throat was full of sobs, but that her heart was laden with\r\nmingled joy and sorrow, so that she could not find a word to express\r\nherself. She went to her bedroom and took out her letter-case to do\r\nas he had bidden her;--but she found that she could not write. This\r\nletter should be one so framed as to make John Gordon joyful; but it\r\nwould be impossible to bring her joy so to the surface as to satisfy\r\nhim even with contentment. She could only think how far it might yet\r\nbe possible to sacrifice herself and him. She sat thus an hour, and\r\nthen went back, and, hearing voices, descended to the drawing-room.\r\nThere she found Mr Blake and Kattie Forrester and Evelina Hall. They\r\nhad come to call upon Mr Whittlestaff and herself, and were full of\r\ntheir own news. "Oh, Miss Lawrie, what do you think?" said Mr Blake.\r\nMiss Lawrie, however, could not think, nor could Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n"Think of whatever is the greatest joy in the world," said Mr Blake.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make yourself such a goose," said Kattie Forrester.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I am in earnest. The greatest joy in all the world."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean you\'re going to be married," said Mr\r\nWhittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. How good you are at guessing! Kattie has named the day.\r\nThis day fortnight. Oh dear, isn\'t it near?"\r\n\r\n"If you think so, it shall be this day fortnight next year," said\r\nKattie.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no! I didn\'t mean that at all. It can\'t be too near. And you\r\ncouldn\'t put it off now, you know, because the Dean has been bespoke.\r\nIt is a good thing to have the Dean to fasten the knot. Don\'t you\r\nthink so, Miss Lawrie?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose one clergyman is just the same as another," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"So I tell him. It will all be one twenty years hence. After all, the\r\nDean is an old frump, and papa does not care a bit about him."\r\n\r\n"But how are you to manage with Mr Newface?" asked Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the best part of it all. Mr Hall is such a brick, that when\r\nwe come back from the Isle of Wight he is going to take us all in."\r\n\r\n"If that\'s the best of it, you can be taken in without me," said\r\nKattie.\r\n\r\n"But it is good; is it not? We two, and her maid. She\'s to be\r\npromoted to nurse one of these days."\r\n\r\n"If you\'re such a fool, I never will have you. It\'s not too late yet,\r\nremember that." All which rebukes--and there were many of them--Mr\r\nMontagu Blake received with loud demonstrations of joy. "And so, Miss\r\nLawrie, you\'re to be in the same boat too," said Mr Blake. "I know\r\nall about it."\r\n\r\nMary blushed, and looked at Mr Whittlestaff. But he took upon\r\nhimself the task of answering the clergyman\'s remarks. "But how do\r\nyou know anything about Miss Lawrie?"\r\n\r\n"You think that no one can go up to London but yourself, Mr\r\nWhittlestaff. I was up there myself yesterday;--as soon as ever this\r\ngreat question of the day was positively settled, I had to look after\r\nmy own _trousseau_. I don\'t see why a gentleman isn\'t to have a\r\n_trousseau_ as well as a lady. At any rate, I wanted a new black\r\nsuit, fit for the hymeneal altar. And when there I made out John\r\nGordon, and soon wormed the truth out of him. At least he did not\r\ntell me downright, but he let the cat so far out of the bag that\r\nI soon guessed the remainder. I always knew how it would be, Miss\r\nLawrie."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t know anything at all about it," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n"It would be very much more becoming if you would learn sometimes to\r\nhold your tongue."\r\n\r\nThen Miss Evelina Hall struck in. Would Miss Lawrie come over to\r\nLittle Alresford Park, and stay there for a few days previous to the\r\nwedding? Kattie Forrester meant to bring down a sister with her as\r\na bridesmaid. Two of the Miss Halls were to officiate also, and it\r\nwould be taken as a great favour if Miss Lawrie would make a fourth.\r\nA great deal was said to press upon her this view of the case, to\r\nwhich, however, she made many objections. There was, indeed, a\r\ntragedy connected with her own matrimonial circumstances, which did\r\nnot make her well inclined to join such a party. Her heart was not at\r\nease within her as to her desertion of Mr Whittlestaff. Whatever the\r\nfuture might bring forth, the present could not be a period of joy\r\nBut in the middle of the argument, Mr Whittlestaff spoke with the\r\nvoice of authority. "Accept Mr Hall\'s kindness," he said, "and go\r\nover for a while to Little Alresford."\r\n\r\n"And leave you all alone?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Mr Hall will be delighted if you will come too," said Mr\r\nBlake, ready at the moment to answer for the extent of his patron\'s\r\nhouse and good-nature.\r\n\r\n"Quite out of the question," said Mr Whittlestaff, in a tone of\r\nvoice intended to put an end to that matter. "But I can manage to\r\nlive alone for a few days, seeing that I shall be compelled to do so\r\nbefore long, by Miss Lawrie\'s marriage." Again Mary looked up into\r\nhis face. "It is so, my dear. This young gentleman has managed to\r\nferret out the truth, while looking for his wedding garments. Will\r\nyou tell your papa, Miss Evelina, that Mary will be delighted to\r\naccept his kindness?"\r\n\r\n"And Gordon can come down to me," said Blake, uproariously, rubbing\r\nhis hands; "and we can have three or four final days together, like\r\ntwo jolly young bachelors."\r\n\r\n"Speaking for yourself alone," said Kattie,--"you\'ll have to remain a\r\njolly young bachelor a considerable time still, if you don\'t mend\r\nyour manners."\r\n\r\n"I needn\'t mend my manners till after I\'m married, I suppose." But\r\nthey who knew Mr Blake well were wont to declare that in the matter\r\nof what Miss Forrester called his manners, there would not be much to\r\nmake his wife afraid.\r\n\r\nThe affair was settled as far as it could be settled in Mr Gordon\'s\r\nabsence. Miss Lawrie was to go over and spend a fortnight at Little\r\nAlresford just previous to Kattie Forrester\'s marriage, and Gordon\r\nwas to come down to the marriage, so as to be near to Mary, if he\r\ncould be persuaded to do so. Of this Mr Blake spoke with great\r\ncertainty. "Why shouldn\'t he come and spoon a bit, seeing that he\r\nnever did so yet in his life? Now I have had a lot of it."\r\n\r\n"Not such a lot by any means," said Miss Forrester.\r\n\r\n"According to all accounts he\'s got to begin it. He told me that he\r\nhadn\'t even proposed regular. Doesn\'t that seem odd to you, Kattie?"\r\n\r\n"It seemed very odd when you did it." Then the three of them went\r\naway, and Mary was left to discuss the prospects of her future life\r\nwith Mr Whittlestaff. "You had better both of you come and live\r\nhere," he said. "There would be room enough." Mary thought probably\r\nof the chance there might be of newcomers, but she said nothing. "I\r\nshould go away, of course," said Mr Whittlestaff.\r\n\r\n"Turn you out of your own house!"\r\n\r\n"Why not? I shan\'t stay here any way. I am tired of the place, and\r\nthough I shan\'t care to sell it, I shall make a move. A man ought to\r\nmake a move every now and again. I should like to go to Italy, and\r\nlive at one of those charming little towns."\r\n\r\n"Without a soul to speak to."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t want anybody to speak to. I shall take with me just a few\r\nbooks to read. I wonder whether Mrs Baggett would go with me. She\r\ncan\'t have much more to keep her in England than I have." But this\r\nplan had not been absolutely fixed when Mary retired for the night,\r\nwith the intention of writing her letter to John Gordon before she\r\nwent to bed. Her letter took her long to write. The thinking of it\r\nrather took too long. She sat leaning with her face on her hands,\r\nand with a tear occasionally on her cheek, into the late night,\r\nmeditating rather on the sweet goodness of Mr Whittlestaff than on\r\nthe words of the letter. It had at last been determined that John\r\nGordon should be her husband. That the fates seem to have decided,\r\nand she did acknowledge that in doing so the fates had been\r\naltogether propitious. It would have been very difficult,--now at\r\nlast she owned that truth to herself,--it would have been very\r\ndifficult for her to have been true to the promise she had made,\r\naltogether to eradicate John Gordon from her heart, and to fill up\r\nthe place left with a wife\'s true affection for Mr Whittlestaff. To\r\nthe performance of such a task as that she would not be subjected.\r\nBut on the other hand, John Gordon must permit her to entertain and\r\nto evince a regard for Mr Whittlestaff, not similar at all to the\r\nregard which she would feel for her husband, but almost equal in its\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nAt last she took the paper and did write her letter, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MR GORDON,--I am not surprised at anything that Mr\r\n   Whittlestaff should do which shows the goodness of his\r\n   disposition and the tenderness of his heart. He is, I\r\n   think, the most unselfish of mankind. I believe you to be\r\n   so thoroughly sincere in the affection which you express\r\n   for me, that you must acknowledge that he is so. If you\r\n   love me well enough to make me your wife, what must you\r\n   think of him who has loved me well enough to surrender me\r\n   to one whom I had known before he had taken me under his\r\n   fostering care?\r\n\r\n   You know that I love you, and am willing to become your\r\n   wife. What can I say to you now, except that it is so. It\r\n   is so. And in saying that, I have told you everything as\r\n   to myself. Of him I can only say, that his regard for me\r\n   has been more tender even than that of a father.--Yours\r\n   always most lovingly,\r\n\r\n   MARY LAWRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day came at last on which Mary\'s visit to Little Alresford was to\r\ncommence. Two days later John Gordon was to arrive at the Parsonage,\r\nand Mary\'s period of being "spooned" was to be commenced,--according\r\nto Mr Blake\'s phraseology. "No, my dear; I don\'t think I need go\r\nwith you," said Mr Whittlestaff, when the very day was there.\r\n\r\n"Why not come and call?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t much care about calling," said Mr Whittlestaff. This was\r\nexactly the state of mind to which Mary did not wish to see her\r\nfriend reduced,--that of feeling it to be necessary to avoid his\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n"You think Mr Blake is silly. He is a silly young man, I allow; but\r\nMr Hall has been very civil. As I am to go there for a week, you\r\nmight as well take me." As she spoke she put her arm around him,\r\ncaressing him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care particularly for Mr Blake; but I don\'t think I\'ll go\r\nto Little Alresford." Mary understood, when he said this the second\r\ntime, that the thing was fixed as fate. He would not go to Little\r\nAlresford. Then, in about a quarter of an hour, he began again--"I\r\nthink you\'ll find me gone when you come back again."\r\n\r\n"Gone! where shall you have gone?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite comfortable here. Don\'t look so sad, you dear, dear\r\ngirl." Then he crossed the room and kissed her tenderly. "I have a\r\nnervous irritable feeling which will not let me remain quiet. Of\r\ncourse, I shall come for your marriage, whenever that may be fixed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff, do not talk in that way! That will be a year\r\nto come, or perhaps two or three. Do not let it disturb you in that\r\nway, or I shall swear that I will not be married at all. Why should I\r\nbe married if you are to be miserable?"\r\n\r\n"It has been all settled, my dear. Mr Gordon is to be the lord of\r\nall that. And though you will be supposed to have fixed the day, it\r\nis he that will really fix it;--he, or the circumstances of his life.\r\nWhen a young lady has promised a young gentleman, the marriage may be\r\ndelayed to suit the young gentleman\'s convenience, but never to suit\r\nhers. To tell the truth, it will always be felt convenient that she\r\nshall be married as soon as may be after the promise has been given.\r\nYou will see Mr Gordon in a day or two, and will find out then what\r\nare his wishes."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I shall not consult your wishes?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, my dear. I, at any rate, shall have no\r\nwishes,--except what may be best for your welfare. Of course I must\r\nsee him, and settle some matters that will have to be settled. There\r\nwill be money matters."\r\n\r\n"I have no money," said Mary,--"not a shilling! He knows that."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless there will be money matters, which you will have the\r\ngoodness to leave to me. Are you not my daughter, Mary, my only\r\nchild? Don\'t trouble yourself about such matters as these, but do as\r\nyou\'re bid. Now it is time for you to start, and Hayonotes will be\r\nready to go with you." Having so spoken, Mr Whittlestaff put her\r\ninto the carriage, and she was driven away to Little Alresford.\r\n\r\nIt then wanted a week to the Blake-cum-Forrester marriage, and the\r\nyoung clergyman was beginning to mix a little serious timidity with\r\nhis usual garrulous high spirits. "Upon my word, you know I\'m not\r\nat all sure that they are going to do it right," he said with much\r\nemphasis to Miss Lawrie. "The marriage is to be on Tuesday. She\'s to\r\ngo home on the Saturday. I insist upon being there on the Monday. It\r\nwould make a fellow so awfully nervous travelling on the same day.\r\nBut the other girls--and you\'re one of them, Miss Lawrie--are to go\r\ninto Winchester by train on Tuesday morning, under the charge of John\r\nGordon. If any thing were to happen to any of you, only think, where\r\nshould I be?"\r\n\r\n"Where should we be?" said Miss Lawrie.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t your marriage, you know. But I suppose the wedding could go\r\non even if one of you didn\'t come. It would be such an awful thing\r\nnot to have it done when the Dean is coming." But Mary comforted him,\r\nassuring him that the Halls were very punctual in all their comings\r\nand goings when any event was in hand.\r\n\r\nThen John Gordon came, and, to tell the truth, Mary was subjected for\r\nthe first time to the ceremony of spooning. When he walked up to the\r\ndoor across from the Parsonage, Mary Lawrie took care not to be in\r\nthe way. She took herself to her own bedroom, and there remained,\r\nwith feverish, palpitating heart, till she was summoned by Miss Hall.\r\n"You must come down and bid him welcome, you know."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so; but--"\r\n\r\n"Of course you must come. It must be sooner or later. He is looking\r\nso different from what he was when he was here before. And so he\r\nought, when one considers all things."\r\n\r\n"He has not got another journey before him to South Africa."\r\n\r\n"Without having got what he came for," said Miss Hall. Then when\r\nthey went down, Mary was told that John Gordon had passed through\r\nthe house into the shrubbery, and was invited to follow him. Mary,\r\ndeclaring that she would go alone, took up her hat and boldly went\r\nafter him. As she passed on, across the lawn, she saw his figure\r\ndisappearing among the trees. "I don\'t think it very civil for a\r\nyoung lady\'s young man to vanish in that way," said Miss Hall. But\r\nMary boldly and quickly followed him, without another word.\r\n\r\n"Mary," he said, turning round upon her as soon as they were both out\r\nof sight among the trees. "Mary, you have come at last."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have come."\r\n\r\n"And yet, when I first showed myself at your house, you would hardly\r\nreceive me." But this he said holding her by the hand, and looking\r\ninto her face with his brightest smile. "I had postponed my coming\r\nalmost too late."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. Was it my fault?"\r\n\r\n"No;--nor mine. When I was told that I was doing no good about the\r\nhouse, and reminded that I was penniless, what could I do but go\r\naway?"\r\n\r\n"But why go so far?"\r\n\r\n"I had to go where money could be earned. Considering all things, I\r\nthink I was quick enough. Where else could I have found diamonds but\r\nat the diamond-fields? And I have been perhaps the luckiest fellow\r\nthat has gone and returned."\r\n\r\n"So nearly too late!"\r\n\r\n"But not too late."\r\n\r\n"But you were too late,--only for the inexpressible goodness of\r\nanother. Have you thought what I owe--what you and I owe--to Mr\r\nWhittlestaff?"\r\n\r\n"My darling!"\r\n\r\n"But I am his darling. Only it sounds so conceited in any girl to say\r\nso. Why should he care so much about me?--or why should you, for the\r\nmatter of that?"\r\n\r\n"Mary, Mary, come to me now." And he held out both his hands. She\r\nlooked round, fearing intrusive eyes, but seeing none, she allowed\r\nhim to embrace her. "My own,--at last my own. How well you understood\r\nme in those old days. And yet it was all without a word,--almost\r\nwithout a sign." She bowed her head before she had escaped from his\r\narms. "Now I am a happy man."\r\n\r\n"It is he that has done it for you."\r\n\r\n"Am I not thankful?"\r\n\r\n"How can I be thankful as I ought? Think of the gratitude that I\r\nowe him,--think of all the love! What man has loved as he has done?\r\nWho has brought himself so to abandon to another the reward he had\r\nthought it worth his while to wish for? You must not count the value\r\nof the thing."\r\n\r\n"But I do."\r\n\r\n"But the price he had set upon it! I was to be the comfort of his\r\nlife to come. And it would have been so, had he not seen and had he\r\nnot believed. Because another has loved, he has given up that which\r\nhe has loved himself."\r\n\r\n"It was not for my sake."\r\n\r\n"But it was for mine. You had come first, and had won my poor heart.\r\nI was not worth the winning to either of you."\r\n\r\n"It was for me to judge of that."\r\n\r\n"Just so. But you do not know his heart. How prone he is to hold by\r\nthat which he knows he has made his own. I was his own."\r\n\r\n"You told him the truth when he came to you."\r\n\r\n"I was his own," said Mary, firmly. "Had he bade me never to see\r\nyou again, I should never have seen you. Had he not gone after you\r\nhimself, you would never have come back."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how that might be."\r\n\r\n"It would have been to no good. Having consented to take everything\r\nfrom his hands, I could never have been untrue to him. I tell you\r\nthat I should as certainly have become his wife, as that girl will\r\nbecome the wife of that young clergyman. Of course I was unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Were you, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I was very unhappy. When you flashed upon me there at Croker\'s\r\nHall, I knew at once all the joy that had fallen within my reach. You\r\nwere there, and you had come for me! All the way from Kimberley, just\r\nfor me to smile upon you! Did you not?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I did."\r\n\r\n"When you had found your diamonds, you thought of me,--was it not\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"Of you only."\r\n\r\n"You flatterer! You dear, bonny lover. You whom I had always loved\r\nand prayed for, when I knew not where you were! You who had not left\r\nme to be like Mariana, but had hurried home at once for me when your\r\nman\'s work was done,--doing just what a girl would think that a\r\nman should do for her sake. But it had been all destroyed by the\r\nnecessity of the case. I take no blame to myself."\r\n\r\n"No; none."\r\n\r\n"Looking back at it all, I was right. He had chosen to want me, and\r\nhad a right to me. I had taken his gifts, given with a full hand.\r\nAnd where were you, my own one? Had I a right to think that you were\r\nthinking of me?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; because you have turned out to be one in a hundred: but I was\r\nnot to have known that. Then he asked me, and I thought it best that\r\nhe should know the truth and take his choice. He did take his choice\r\nbefore he knew the truth,--that you were so far on your way to seek\r\nmy hand."\r\n\r\n"I was at that very moment almost within reach of it."\r\n\r\n"But still it had become his. He did not toss it from him then as a\r\nthing that was valueless. With the truest, noblest observance, he\r\nmade me understand how much it might be to him, and then surrendered\r\nit without a word of ill humour, because he told himself that in\r\ntruth my heart was within your keeping. If you will keep it well,\r\nyou must find a place for his also." It was thus that Mary Lawrie\r\nsuffered the spooning that was inflicted upon her by John Gordon.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe most important part of our narrative still remains. When the day\r\ncame, the Reverend Montagu Blake was duly married to Miss Catherine\r\nForrester in Winchester Cathedral, by the Very Reverend the Dean,\r\nassisted by the young lady\'s father; and it is pleasant to think that\r\non that occasion the two clergymen behaved to each other with extreme\r\ncivility. Mr Blake at once took his wife over to the Isle of Wight,\r\nand came back at the end of a month to enjoy the hospitality of Mr\r\nHall. And with them came that lady\'s maid, of whose promotion to\r\na higher sphere in life we shall expect soon to hear. Then came a\r\nperiod of thorough enjoyment for Mr Blake in superintending the work\r\nof Mr Newface.\r\n\r\n"What a pity it is that the house should ever be finished!" said\r\nthe bride to Augusta Hall; "because as things are now, Montagu is\r\nsupremely happy: he will never be so happy again."\r\n\r\n"Unless when the baby comes," said Augusta.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'ll care a bit about the baby," said the bride.\r\n\r\nThe writer, however, is of a different opinion, as he is inclined\r\nto think that the Reverend Montagu Blake will be a pattern for all\r\nfathers. One word more we must add of Mr Whittlestaff and his future\r\nlife,--and one word of Mrs Baggett. Mr Whittlestaff did not leave\r\nCroker\'s Hall. When October had come round, he was present at Mary\'s\r\nmarriage, and certainly did not carry himself then with any show\r\nof outward joy. He was moody and silent, and, as some said, almost\r\nuncourteous to John Gordon. But before Mary went down to the train,\r\nin preparation of her long wedding-tour, he took her up to his\r\nbedroom, and there said a final word to her. "Give him my love."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling! you have made me so happy."\r\n\r\n"You will find me better when you come back, though I shall never\r\ncease to regret all that I have lost."\r\n\r\nMrs Baggett accepted her destiny, and remained in supreme dominion\r\nover all women-kind at Croker\'s Hall. But there was private pecuniary\r\narrangement between her and her master, of which I could never learn\r\nthe details. It resulted, however, in the sending of a money-order\r\nevery Saturday morning to an old woman in whose custody the Sergeant\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s notes:\r\n\r\n   Obvious typographical errors have been corrected. Specific\r\n   changes in wording of the text are listed below.\r\n\r\n   Chapter II, paragraph 1. The word "man\'s" has been substituted\r\n   for "man his" in the sentence: In some things his life had been\r\n   successful; but these were matters in which the world does not\r\n   write down a MAN\'S good luck as being generally conducive to his\r\n   happiness.\r\n\r\n   Chapter V, paragraph 47. The words "living here" have been\r\n   substituted for "loving him" in the sentence: After all that has\r\n   passed between us, you can hardly go on LIVING HERE as you have\r\n   done.\r\n\r\n   Chapter VI, last paragraph. The words "than that" have been\r\n   substituted for "that than" in the sentence: The weather is very\r\n   hot, and from morning till night there is no occupation other\r\n   THAN THAT of looking for diamonds, and the works attending it.\r\n\r\n   Chapter IX, paragraph 8. The sentence, "There isn\'t a better\r\n   fellow living than Mr Furnival, or his wife, or his four\r\n   daughters." might leave the reader wondering who is Mr Furnival,\r\n   as the name does not appear again in the text. The man referred\r\n   to is later called Mr Hall.\r\n\r\n   Chapter XV, paragraph 12. The word "his" has been inserted in the\r\n   sentence: "Have you seen HIS diamonds, Miss Lawrie?"\r\n\r\n   Chapter XV, paragraph 32. The word "as" has been inserted in the\r\n   sentence: "I don\'t know any spot on God\'s earth that I should be\r\n   less likely to choose AS my abiding resting-place."\r\n\r\n   Chapter XIX, paragraph 56. The word "gone" has been substituted\r\n   for "come" in the sentence: "What is it he means, Miss?" said Mrs\r\n   Baggett, when the master was GONE.\r\n\r\n   Chapter XXI, paragraph 35. The word "it" has been inserted in the\r\n   sentence: "What is IT that you wish, Mr Whittlestaff?" he asked.\r\n\r\n   Chapter XXII, paragraph 42. The word "had" has been substituted\r\n   for "has" in the sentence: For indeed her life in public,--her\r\n   life, that is, to which Mrs Baggett HAD access,--had been in some\r\n   degree disturbed since the departure of the master of the house.\r\n\r\n   Chapter XXIV, paragraph 34. The word "those" has been substituted\r\n   for "these" in the sentence: How well you understood me in THOSE\r\n   old days.\r\n\r\n   Chapter XXIV, paragraph 53. The word "were" has been substitute\r\n   for "was" in the sentence: You whom I had always loved and prayed\r\n   for, when I knew not where you WERE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AN OLD MAN\'S LOVE***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 25001.txt or 25001.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/5/0/0/25001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
