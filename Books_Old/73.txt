As the landscape\r\nchanged from brown to green, the army awakened, and began to tremble\r\nwith eagerness at the noise of rumors. It cast its eyes upon the roads,\r\nwhich were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper\r\nthoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled\r\nat the army\xe2\x80\x99s feet; and at night, when the stream had become of a\r\nsorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eyelike gleam of\r\nhostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills.\r\n\r\nOnce a certain tall soldier developed virtues and went resolutely to\r\nwash a shirt. He came flying back from a brook waving his garment\r\nbannerlike. He was swelled with a tale he had heard from a reliable\r\nfriend, who had heard it from a truthful cavalryman, who had heard it\r\nfrom his trustworthy brother, one of the orderlies at division\r\nheadquarters. He adopted the important air of a herald in red and gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 move t\xe2\x80\x99morrah\xe2\x80\x94sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pompously to a group in\r\nthe company street. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99way up the river, cut across, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncome around in behint \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo his attentive audience he drew a loud and elaborate plan of a very\r\nbrilliant campaign. When he had finished, the blue-clothed men\r\nscattered into small arguing groups between the rows of squat brown\r\nhuts. A negro teamster who had been dancing upon a cracker box with the\r\nhilarious encouragement of twoscore soldiers was deserted. He sat\r\nmournfully down. Smoke drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint\r\nchimneys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie! that\xe2\x80\x99s all it is\xe2\x80\x94a thunderin\xe2\x80\x99 lie!\xe2\x80\x9d said another private\r\nloudly. His smooth face was flushed, and his hands were thrust sulkily\r\ninto his trouser\xe2\x80\x99s pockets. He took the matter as an affront to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe the derned old army\xe2\x80\x99s ever going to move. We\xe2\x80\x99re set. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot ready to move eight times in the last two weeks, and we ain\xe2\x80\x99t moved\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier felt called upon to defend the truth of a rumor he\r\nhimself had introduced. He and the loud one came near to fighting over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA corporal began to swear before the assemblage. He had just put a\r\ncostly board floor in his house, he said. During the early spring he\r\nhad refrained from adding extensively to the comfort of his environment\r\nbecause he had felt that the army might start on the march at any\r\nmoment. Of late, however, he had been impressed that they were in a\r\nsort of eternal camp.\r\n\r\nMany of the men engaged in a spirited debate. One outlined in a\r\npeculiarly lucid manner all the plans of the commanding general. He was\r\nopposed by men who advocated that there were other plans of campaign.\r\nThey clamored at each other, numbers making futile bids for the popular\r\nattention. Meanwhile, the soldier who had fetched the rumor bustled\r\nabout with much importance. He was continually assailed by questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99army\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what yeh talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about? How yeh know it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yeh kin b\xe2\x80\x99lieve me er not, jest as yeh like. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a\r\nhang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was much food for thought in the manner in which he replied. He\r\ncame near to convincing them by disdaining to produce proofs. They grew\r\nmuch excited over it.\r\n\r\nThere was a youthful private who listened with eager ears to the words\r\nof the tall soldier and to the varied comments of his comrades. After\r\nreceiving a fill of discussions concerning marches and attacks, he went\r\nto his hut and crawled through an intricate hole that served it as a\r\ndoor. He wished to be alone with some new thoughts that had lately come\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe lay down on a wide bunk that stretched across the end of the room.\r\nIn the other end, cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture. They\r\nwere grouped about the fireplace. A picture from an illustrated weekly\r\nwas upon the log walls, and three rifles were paralleled on pegs.\r\nEquipments hung on handy projections, and some tin dishes lay upon a\r\nsmall pile of firewood. A folded tent was serving as a roof. The\r\nsunlight, without, beating upon it, made it glow a light yellow shade.\r\nA small window shot an oblique square of whiter light upon the\r\ncluttered floor. The smoke from the fire at times neglected the clay\r\nchimney and wreathed into the room, and this flimsy chimney of clay and\r\nsticks made endless threats to set ablaze the whole establishment.\r\n\r\nThe youth was in a little trance of astonishment. So they were at last\r\ngoing to fight. On the morrow, perhaps, there would be a battle, and he\r\nwould be in it. For a time he was obliged to labor to make himself\r\nbelieve. He could not accept with assurance an omen that he was about\r\nto mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth.\r\n\r\nHe had, of course, dreamed of battles all his life\xe2\x80\x94of vague and bloody\r\nconflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire. In visions\r\nhe had seen himself in many struggles. He had imagined peoples secure\r\nin the shadow of his eagle-eyed prowess. But awake he had regarded\r\nbattles as crimson blotches on the pages of the past. He had put them\r\nas things of the bygone with his thought-images of heavy crowns and\r\nhigh castles. There was a portion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s history which he had\r\nregarded as the time of wars, but it, he thought, had been long gone\r\nover the horizon and had disappeared forever.\r\n\r\nFrom his home his youthful eyes had looked upon the war in his own\r\ncountry with distrust. It must be some sort of a play affair. He had\r\nlong despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle. Such would be no\r\nmore, he had said. Men were better, or more timid. Secular and\r\nreligious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or else\r\nfirm finance held in check the passions.\r\n\r\nHe had burned several times to enlist. Tales of great movements shook\r\nthe land. They might not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to be\r\nmuch glory in them. He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he\r\nhad longed to see it all. His busy mind had drawn for him large\r\npictures extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds.\r\n\r\nBut his mother had discouraged him. She had affected to look with some\r\ncontempt upon the quality of his war ardor and patriotism. She could\r\ncalmly seat herself and with no apparent difficulty give him many\r\nhundreds of reasons why he was of vastly more importance on the farm\r\nthan on the field of battle. She had had certain ways of expression\r\nthat told him that her statements on the subject came from a deep\r\nconviction. Moreover, on her side, was his belief that her ethical\r\nmotive in the argument was impregnable.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, he had made firm rebellion against this yellow light\r\nthrown upon the color of his ambitions. The newspapers, the gossip of\r\nthe village, his own picturings, had aroused him to an uncheckable\r\ndegree. They were in truth fighting finely down there. Almost every day\r\nthe newspaper printed accounts of a decisive victory.\r\n\r\nOne night, as he lay in bed, the winds had carried to him the\r\nclangoring of the church bell as some enthusiast jerked the rope\r\nfrantically to tell the twisted news of a great battle. This voice of\r\nthe people rejoicing in the night had made him shiver in a prolonged\r\necstasy of excitement. Later, he had gone down to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room and\r\nhad spoken thus: \xe2\x80\x9cMa, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to enlist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother had replied. She had then\r\ncovered her face with the quilt. There was an end to the matter for\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the next morning he had gone to a town that was near his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s farm and had enlisted in a company that was forming there.\r\nWhen he had returned home his mother was milking the brindle cow. Four\r\nothers stood waiting. \xe2\x80\x9cMa, I\xe2\x80\x99ve enlisted,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to her\r\ndiffidently. There was a short silence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord\xe2\x80\x99s will be done,\r\nHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d she had finally replied, and had then continued to milk the\r\nbrindle cow.\r\n\r\nWhen he had stood in the doorway with his soldier\xe2\x80\x99s clothes on his\r\nback, and with the light of excitement and expectancy in his eyes\r\nalmost defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds, he had seen two\r\ntears leaving their trails on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s scarred cheeks.\r\n\r\nStill, she had disappointed him by saying nothing whatever about\r\nreturning with his shield or on it. He had privately primed himself for\r\na beautiful scene. He had prepared certain sentences which he thought\r\ncould be used with touching effect. But her words destroyed his plans.\r\nShe had doggedly peeled potatoes and addressed him as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwatch out, Henry, an\xe2\x80\x99 take good care of yerself in this here fighting\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94you watch, an\xe2\x80\x99 take good care of yerself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou can lick the hull rebel army at the start, because yeh can\xe2\x80\x99t. Yer\r\njest one little feller amongst a hull lot of others, and yeh\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nkeep quiet an\xe2\x80\x99 do what they tell yeh. I know how you are, Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve knet yeh eight pair of socks, Henry, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve put in all yer best\r\nshirts, because I want my boy to be jest as warm and comf\xe2\x80\x99able as\r\nanybody in the army. Whenever they get holes in \xe2\x80\x99em, I want yeh to send\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em right-away back to me, so\xe2\x80\x99s I kin dern \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 allus be careful an\xe2\x80\x99 choose yer comp\xe2\x80\x99ny. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of bad men\r\nin the army, Henry. The army makes \xe2\x80\x99em wild, and they like nothing\r\nbetter than the job of leading off a young feller like you, as ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnever been away from home much and has allus had a mother, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\na-learning \xe2\x80\x99em to drink and swear. Keep clear of them folks, Henry. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want yeh to ever do anything, Henry, that yeh would be \xe2\x80\x99shamed to\r\nlet me know about. Jest think as if I was a-watchin\xe2\x80\x99 yeh. If yeh keep\r\nthat in yer mind allus, I guess yeh\xe2\x80\x99ll come out about right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh must allus remember yer father, too, child, an\xe2\x80\x99 remember he never\r\ndrunk a drop of licker in his life, and seldom swore a cross oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to tell yeh, Henry, excepting that yeh must\r\nnever do no shirking, child, on my account. If so be a time comes when\r\nyeh have to be kilt or do a mean thing, why, Henry, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\nanything \xe2\x80\x99cept what\xe2\x80\x99s right, because there\xe2\x80\x99s many a woman has to bear\r\nup \xe2\x80\x99ginst sech things these times, and the Lord\xe2\x80\x99ll take keer of us all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forgit about the socks and the shirts, child; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve put a cup\r\nof blackberry jam with yer bundle, because I know yeh like it above all\r\nthings. Good-by, Henry. Watch out, and be a good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had, of course, been impatient under the ordeal of this speech. It\r\nhad not been quite what he expected, and he had borne it with an air of\r\nirritation. He departed feeling vague relief.\r\n\r\nStill, when he had looked back from the gate, he had seen his mother\r\nkneeling among the potato parings. Her brown face, upraised, was\r\nstained with tears, and her spare form was quivering. He bowed his head\r\nand went on, feeling suddenly ashamed of his purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom his home he had gone to the seminary to bid adieu to many\r\nschoolmates. They had thronged about him with wonder and admiration. He\r\nhad felt the gulf now between them and had swelled with calm pride. He\r\nand some of his fellows who had donned blue were quite overwhelmed with\r\nprivileges for all of one afternoon, and it had been a very delicious\r\nthing. They had strutted.\r\n\r\nA certain light-haired girl had made vivacious fun at his martial\r\nspirit, but there was another and darker girl whom he had gazed at\r\nsteadfastly, and he thought she grew demure and sad at sight of his\r\nblue and brass. As he had walked down the path between the rows of\r\noaks, he had turned his head and detected her at a window watching his\r\ndeparture. As he perceived her, she had immediately begun to stare up\r\nthrough the high tree branches at the sky. He had seen a good deal of\r\nflurry and haste in her movement as she changed her attitude. He often\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Washington his spirit had soared. The regiment was fed\r\nand caressed at station after station until the youth had believed that\r\nhe must be a hero. There was a lavish expenditure of bread and cold\r\nmeats, coffee, and pickles and cheese. As he basked in the smiles of\r\nthe girls and was patted and complimented by the old men, he had felt\r\ngrowing within him the strength to do mighty deeds of arms.\r\n\r\nAfter complicated journeyings with many pauses, there had come months\r\nof monotonous life in a camp. He had had the belief that real war was a\r\nseries of death struggles with small time in between for sleep and\r\nmeals; but since his regiment had come to the field the army had done\r\nlittle but sit still and try to keep warm.\r\n\r\nHe was brought then gradually back to his old ideas. Greeklike\r\nstruggles would be no more. Men were better, or more timid. Secular and\r\nreligious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or else\r\nfirm finance held in check the passions.\r\n\r\nHe had grown to regard himself merely as a part of a vast blue\r\ndemonstration. His province was to look out, as far as he could, for\r\nhis personal comfort. For recreation he could twiddle his thumbs and\r\nspeculate on the thoughts which must agitate the minds of the generals.\r\nAlso, he was drilled and drilled and reviewed, and drilled and drilled\r\nand reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe only foes he had seen were some pickets along the river bank. They\r\nwere a sun-tanned, philosophical lot, who sometimes shot reflectively\r\nat the blue pickets. When reproached for this afterward, they usually\r\nexpressed sorrow, and swore by their gods that the guns had exploded\r\nwithout their permission. The youth, on guard duty one night, conversed\r\nacross the stream with one of them. He was a slightly ragged man, who\r\nspat skillfully between his shoes and possessed a great fund of bland\r\nand infantile assurance. The youth liked him personally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYank,\xe2\x80\x9d the other had informed him, \xe2\x80\x9cyer a right dum good feller.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nsentiment, floating to him upon the still air, had made him temporarily\r\nregret war.\r\n\r\nVarious veterans had told him tales. Some talked of gray, bewhiskered\r\nhordes who were advancing with relentless curses and chewing tobacco\r\nwith unspeakable valor; tremendous bodies of fierce soldiery who were\r\nsweeping along like the Huns. Others spoke of tattered and eternally\r\nhungry men who fired despondent powders. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll charge through hell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfire an\xe2\x80\x99 brimstone t\xe2\x80\x99 git a holt on a haversack, an\xe2\x80\x99 sech stomachs\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a\xe2\x80\x99lastin\xe2\x80\x99 long,\xe2\x80\x9d he was told. From the stories, the youth\r\nimagined the red, live bones sticking out through slits in the faded\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\nStill, he could not put a whole faith in veteran\xe2\x80\x99s tales, for recruits\r\nwere their prey. They talked much of smoke, fire, and blood, but he\r\ncould not tell how much might be lies. They persistently yelled \xe2\x80\x9cFresh\r\nfish!\xe2\x80\x9d at him, and were in no wise to be trusted.\r\n\r\nHowever, he perceived now that it did not greatly matter what kind of\r\nsoldiers he was going to fight, so long as they fought, which fact no\r\none disputed. There was a more serious problem. He lay in his bunk\r\npondering upon it. He tried to mathematically prove to himself that he\r\nwould not run from a battle.\r\n\r\nPreviously he had never felt obliged to wrestle too seriously with this\r\nquestion. In his life he had taken certain things for granted, never\r\nchallenging his belief in ultimate success, and bothering little about\r\nmeans and roads. But here he was confronted with a thing of moment. It\r\nhad suddenly appeared to him that perhaps in a battle he might run. He\r\nwas forced to admit that as far as war was concerned he knew nothing of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nA sufficient time before he would have allowed the problem to kick its\r\nheels at the outer portals of his mind, but now he felt compelled to\r\ngive serious attention to it.\r\n\r\nA little panic-fear grew in his mind. As his imagination went forward\r\nto a fight, he saw hideous possibilities. He contemplated the lurking\r\nmenaces of the future, and failed in an effort to see himself standing\r\nstoutly in the midst of them. He recalled his visions of broken-bladed\r\nglory, but in the shadow of the impending tumult he suspected them to\r\nbe impossible pictures.\r\n\r\nHe sprang from the bunk and began to pace nervously to and fro. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nLord, what\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 matter with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.\r\n\r\nHe felt that in this crisis his laws of life were useless. Whatever he\r\nhad learned of himself was here of no avail. He was an unknown\r\nquantity. He saw that he would again be obliged to experiment as he had\r\nin early youth. He must accumulate information of himself, and\r\nmeanwhile he resolved to remain close upon his guard lest those\r\nqualities of which he knew nothing should everlastingly disgrace him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in dismay.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the tall soldier slid dexterously through the hole. The\r\nloud private followed. They were wrangling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall soldier as he entered. He waved his\r\nhand expressively. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can believe me or not, jest as you like. All\r\nyou got to do is sit down and wait as quiet as you can. Then pretty\r\nsoon you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out I was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis comrade grunted stubbornly. For a moment he seemed to be searching\r\nfor a formidable reply. Finally he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\neverything in the world, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t say I knew everything in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other\r\nsharply. He began to stow various articles snugly into his knapsack.\r\n\r\nThe youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked down at the busy figure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to be a battle, sure, is there, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is.\r\nYou jest wait \xe2\x80\x99til to-morrow, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see one of the biggest battles\r\never was. You jest wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThunder!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see fighting this time, my boy, what\xe2\x80\x99ll be regular\r\nout-and-out fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d added the tall soldier, with the air of a man\r\nwho is about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud one from a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the youth, \xe2\x80\x9clike as not this story\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out jest\r\nlike them others did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much it won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall soldier, exasperated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the cavalry all start this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d He glared about\r\nhim. No one denied his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cavalry started this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say there ain\xe2\x80\x99t hardly any cavalry left in camp.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to Richmond, or some place, while we fight all the\r\nJohnnies. It\xe2\x80\x99s some dodge like that. The regiment\xe2\x80\x99s got orders, too. A\r\nfeller what seen \xe2\x80\x99em go to headquarters told me a little while ago. And\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re raising blazes all over camp\xe2\x80\x94anybody can see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud one.\r\n\r\nThe youth remained silent for a time. At last he spoke to the tall\r\nsoldier. \xe2\x80\x9cJim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think the reg\xe2\x80\x99ment \xe2\x80\x99ll do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99ll fight all right, I guess, after they once get into it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the other with cold judgment. He made a fine use of the third\r\nperson. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been heaps of fun poked at \xe2\x80\x99em because they\xe2\x80\x99re new, of\r\ncourse, and all that; but they\xe2\x80\x99ll fight all right, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink any of the boys \xe2\x80\x99ll run?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there may be a few of \xe2\x80\x99em run, but there\xe2\x80\x99s them kind in every\r\nregiment, \xe2\x80\x99specially when they first goes under fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other\r\nin a tolerant way. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it might happen that the hull\r\nkit-and-boodle might start and run, if some big fighting came\r\nfirst-off, and then again they might stay and fight like fun. But you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bet on nothing. Of course they ain\xe2\x80\x99t never been under fire yet,\r\nand it ain\xe2\x80\x99t likely they\xe2\x80\x99ll lick the hull rebel army all-to-oncet the\r\nfirst time; but I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll fight better than some, if worse than\r\nothers. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way I figger. They call the reg\xe2\x80\x99ment \xe2\x80\x98Fresh fish\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand everything; but the boys come of good stock, and most of \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfight like sin after they oncet git shootin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a mighty\r\nemphasis on the last four words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you think you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the loud soldier with scorn.\r\n\r\nThe other turned savagely upon him. They had a rapid altercation, in\r\nwhich they fastened upon each other various strange epithets.\r\n\r\nThe youth at last interrupted them. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever think you might run\r\nyourself, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. On concluding the sentence he laughed as if\r\nhe had meant to aim a joke. The loud soldier also giggled.\r\n\r\nThe tall private waved his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he profoundly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nthought it might get too hot for Jim Conklin in some of them\r\nscrimmages, and if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d start and run. And if I once started to run, I\xe2\x80\x99d run like the\r\ndevil, and no mistake. But if everybody was a-standing and a-fighting,\r\nwhy, I\xe2\x80\x99d stand and fight. Be jiminey, I would. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud one.\r\n\r\nThe youth of this tale felt gratitude for these words of his comrade.\r\nHe had feared that all of the untried men possessed great and correct\r\nconfidence. He now was in a measure reassured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the youth discovered that his tall comrade had been\r\nthe fast-flying messenger of a mistake. There was much scoffing at the\r\nlatter by those who had yesterday been firm adherents of his views, and\r\nthere was even a little sneering by men who had never believed the\r\nrumor. The tall one fought with a man from Chatfield Corners and beat\r\nhim severely.\r\n\r\nThe youth felt, however, that his problem was in no wise lifted from\r\nhim. There was, on the contrary, an irritating prolongation. The tale\r\nhad created in him a great concern for himself. Now, with the newborn\r\nquestion in his mind, he was compelled to sink back into his old place\r\nas part of a blue demonstration.\r\n\r\nFor days he made ceaseless calculations, but they were all wondrously\r\nunsatisfactory. He found that he could establish nothing. He finally\r\nconcluded that the only way to prove himself was to go into the blaze,\r\nand then figuratively to watch his legs to discover their merits and\r\nfaults. He reluctantly admitted that he could not sit still and with a\r\nmental slate and pencil derive an answer. To gain it, he must have\r\nblaze, blood, and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that, and\r\nthe other. So he fretted for an opportunity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he continually tried to measure himself by his comrades. The\r\ntall soldier, for one, gave him some assurance. This man\xe2\x80\x99s serene\r\nunconcern dealt him a measure of confidence, for he had known him since\r\nchildhood, and from his intimate knowledge he did not see how he could\r\nbe capable of anything that was beyond him, the youth. Still, he\r\nthought that his comrade might be mistaken about himself. Or, on the\r\nother hand, he might be a man heretofore doomed to peace and obscurity,\r\nbut, in reality, made to shine in war.\r\n\r\nThe youth would have liked to have discovered another who suspected\r\nhimself. A sympathetic comparison of mental notes would have been a joy\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe occasionally tried to fathom a comrade with seductive sentences. He\r\nlooked about to find men in the proper mood. All attempts failed to\r\nbring forth any statement which looked in any way like a confession to\r\nthose doubts which he privately acknowledged in himself. He was afraid\r\nto make an open declaration of his concern, because he dreaded to place\r\nsome unscrupulous confidant upon the high plane of the unconfessed from\r\nwhich elevation he could be derided.\r\n\r\nIn regard to his companions his mind wavered between two opinions,\r\naccording to his mood. Sometimes he inclined to believing them all\r\nheroes. In fact, he usually admired in secret the superior development\r\nof the higher qualities in others. He could conceive of men going very\r\ninsignificantly about the world bearing a load of courage unseen, and\r\nalthough he had known many of his comrades through boyhood, he began to\r\nfear that his judgment of them had been blind. Then, in other moments,\r\nhe flouted these theories, and assured him that his fellows were all\r\nprivately wondering and quaking.\r\n\r\nHis emotions made him feel strange in the presence of men who talked\r\nexcitedly of a prospective battle as of a drama they were about to\r\nwitness, with nothing but eagerness and curiosity apparent in their\r\nfaces. It was often that he suspected them to be liars.\r\n\r\nHe did not pass such thoughts without severe condemnation of himself.\r\nHe dinned reproaches at times. He was convicted by himself of many\r\nshameful crimes against the gods of traditions.\r\n\r\nIn his great anxiety his heart was continually clamoring at what he\r\nconsidered the intolerable slowness of the generals. They seemed\r\ncontent to perch tranquilly on the river bank, and leave him bowed down\r\nby the weight of a great problem. He wanted it settled forthwith. He\r\ncould not long bear such a load, he said. Sometimes his anger at the\r\ncommanders reached an acute stage, and he grumbled about the camp like\r\na veteran.\r\n\r\nOne morning, however, he found himself in the ranks of his prepared\r\nregiment. The men were whispering speculations and recounting the old\r\nrumors. In the gloom before the break of the day their uniforms glowed\r\na deep purple hue. From across the river the red eyes were still\r\npeering. In the eastern sky there was a yellow patch like a rug laid\r\nfor the feet of the coming sun; and against it, black and patternlike,\r\nloomed the gigantic figure of the colonel on a gigantic horse.\r\n\r\nFrom off in the darkness came the trampling of feet. The youth could\r\noccasionally see dark shadows that moved like monsters. The regiment\r\nstood at rest for what seemed a long time. The youth grew impatient. It\r\nwas unendurable the way these affairs were managed. He wondered how\r\nlong they were to be kept waiting.\r\n\r\nAs he looked all about him and pondered upon the mystic gloom, he began\r\nto believe that at any moment the ominous distance might be aflare, and\r\nthe rolling crashes of an engagement come to his ears. Staring once at\r\nthe red eyes across the river, he conceived them to be growing larger,\r\nas the orbs of a row of dragons advancing. He turned toward the colonel\r\nand saw him lift his gigantic arm and calmly stroke his mustache.\r\n\r\nAt last he heard from along the road at the foot of the hill the\r\nclatter of a horse\xe2\x80\x99s galloping hoofs. It must be the coming of orders.\r\nHe bent forward, scarce breathing. The exciting clickety-click, as it\r\ngrew louder and louder, seemed to be beating upon his soul. Presently a\r\nhorseman with jangling equipment drew rein before the colonel of the\r\nregiment. The two held a short, sharp-worded conversation. The men in\r\nthe foremost ranks craned their necks.\r\n\r\nAs the horseman wheeled his animal and galloped away he turned to shout\r\nover his shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that box of cigars!\xe2\x80\x9d The colonel\r\nmumbled in reply. The youth wondered what a box of cigars had to do\r\nwith war.\r\n\r\nA moment later the regiment went swinging off into the darkness. It was\r\nnow like one of those moving monsters wending with many feet. The air\r\nwas heavy, and cold with dew. A mass of wet grass, marched upon,\r\nrustled like silk.\r\n\r\nThere was an occasional flash and glimmer of steel from the backs of\r\nall these huge crawling reptiles. From the road came creakings and\r\ngrumblings as some surly guns were dragged away.\r\n\r\nThe men stumbled along still muttering speculations. There was a\r\nsubdued debate. Once a man fell down, and as he reached for his rifle a\r\ncomrade, unseeing, trod upon his hand. He of the injured fingers swore\r\nbitterly, and aloud. A low, tittering laugh went among his fellows.\r\n\r\nPresently they passed into a roadway and marched forward with easy\r\nstrides. A dark regiment moved before them, and from behind also came\r\nthe tinkle of equipments on the bodies of marching men.\r\n\r\nThe rushing yellow of the developing day went on behind their backs.\r\nWhen the sunrays at last struck full and mellowingly upon the earth,\r\nthe youth saw that the landscape was streaked with two long, thin,\r\nblack columns which disappeared on the brow of a hill in front and\r\nrearward vanished in a wood. They were like two serpents crawling from\r\nthe cavern of the night.\r\n\r\nThe river was not in view. The tall soldier burst into praises of what\r\nhe thought to be his powers of perception.\r\n\r\nSome of the tall one\xe2\x80\x99s companions cried with emphasis that they, too,\r\nhad evolved the same thing, and they congratulated themselves upon it.\r\nBut there were others who said that the tall one\xe2\x80\x99s plan was not the\r\ntrue one at all. They persisted with other theories. There was a\r\nvigorous discussion.\r\n\r\nThe youth took no part in them. As he walked along in careless line he\r\nwas engaged with his own eternal debate. He could not hinder himself\r\nfrom dwelling upon it. He was despondent and sullen, and threw shifting\r\nglances about him. He looked ahead, often expecting to hear from the\r\nadvance the rattle of firing.\r\n\r\nBut the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster\r\nof smoke. A dun-colored cloud of dust floated away to the right. The\r\nsky overhead was of a fairy blue.\r\n\r\nThe youth studied the faces of his companions, ever on the watch to\r\ndetect kindred emotions. He suffered disappointment. Some ardor of the\r\nair which was causing the veteran commands to move with glee\xe2\x80\x94almost\r\nwith song\xe2\x80\x94had infected the new regiment. The men began to speak of\r\nvictory as of a thing they knew. Also, the tall soldier received his\r\nvindication. They were certainly going to come around in behind the\r\nenemy. They expressed commiseration for that part of the army which had\r\nbeen left upon the river bank, felicitating themselves upon being a\r\npart of a blasting host.\r\n\r\nThe youth, considering himself as separated from the others, was\r\nsaddened by the blithe and merry speeches that went from rank to rank.\r\nThe company wags all made their best endeavors. The regiment tramped to\r\nthe tune of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe blatant soldier often convulsed whole files by his biting sarcasms\r\naimed at the tall one.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not long before all the men seemed to forget their mission.\r\nWhole brigades grinned in unison, and regiments laughed.\r\n\r\nA rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse from a dooryard. He\r\nplanned to load his knapsack upon it. He was escaping with his prize\r\nwhen a young girl rushed from the house and grabbed the animal\xe2\x80\x99s mane.\r\nThere followed a wrangle. The young girl, with pink cheeks and shining\r\neyes, stood like a dauntless statue.\r\n\r\nThe observant regiment, standing at rest in the roadway, whooped at\r\nonce, and entered whole-souled upon the side of the maiden. The men\r\nbecame so engrossed in this affair that they entirely ceased to\r\nremember their own large war. They jeered the piratical private, and\r\ncalled attention to various defects in his personal appearance; and\r\nthey were wildly enthusiastic in support of the young girl.\r\n\r\nTo her, from some distance, came bold advice. \xe2\x80\x9cHit him with a stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were crows and catcalls showered upon him when he retreated\r\nwithout the horse. The regiment rejoiced at his downfall. Loud and\r\nvociferous congratulations were showered upon the maiden, who stood\r\npanting and regarding the troops with defiance.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments\r\nwent into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp\r\nfires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.\r\n\r\nThe youth kept from intercourse with his companions as much as\r\ncircumstances would allow him. In the evening he wandered a few paces\r\ninto the gloom. From this little distance the many fires, with the\r\nblack forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made\r\nweird and satanic effects.\r\n\r\nHe lay down in the grass. The blades pressed tenderly against his\r\ncheek. The moon had been lighted and was hung in a treetop. The liquid\r\nstillness of the night enveloping him made him feel vast pity for\r\nhimself. There was a caress in the soft winds; and the whole mood of\r\nthe darkness, he thought, was one of sympathy for himself in his\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nHe wished, without reserve, that he was at home again making the\r\nendless rounds from the house to the barn, from the barn to the fields,\r\nfrom the fields to the barn, from the barn to the house. He remembered\r\nhe had so often cursed the brindle cow and her mates, and had sometimes\r\nflung milking stools. But, from his present point of view, there was a\r\nhalo of happiness about each of their heads, and he would have\r\nsacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled\r\nto return to them. He told himself that he was not formed for a\r\nsoldier. And he mused seriously upon the radical differences between\r\nhimself and those men who were dodging implike around the fires.\r\n\r\nAs he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass, and, upon turning his\r\nhead, discovered the loud soldier. He called out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Wilson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter approached and looked down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hello, Henry; is it you?\r\nWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\nThe other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting blue\r\nmy boy. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking thundering peek-ed. What the dickens is wrong\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\nThe loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated\r\nfight. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em now!\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke his boyish face was\r\nwreathed in a gleeful smile, and his voice had an exultant ring. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot \xe2\x80\x99em now. At last, by the eternal thunders, we\xe2\x80\x99ll lick \xe2\x80\x99em good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the truth was known,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, more soberly, \xe2\x80\x9c_they\xe2\x80\x99ve_ licked\r\n_us_ about every clip up to now; but this time\xe2\x80\x94this time\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll lick \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ngood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was objecting to this march a little while ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe youth coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind marching, if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fighting at the end of it. What I hate is this\r\ngetting moved here and moved there, with no good coming of it, as far\r\nas I can see, excepting sore feet and damned short rations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jim Conklin says we\xe2\x80\x99ll get plenty of fighting this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s right for once, I guess, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how it come. This\r\ntime we\xe2\x80\x99re in for a big battle, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best end of it,\r\ncertain sure. Gee rod! how we will thump \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly. The thrill of his\r\nenthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step. He was sprightly,\r\nvigorous, fiery in his belief in success. He looked into the future\r\nwith clear proud eye, and he swore with the air of an old soldier.\r\n\r\nThe youth watched him for a moment in silence. When he finally spoke\r\nhis voice was as bitter as dregs. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do great things,\r\nI s\xe2\x80\x99pose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked with dignity; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I s\xe2\x80\x99pose I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nas well as the rest. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try like thunder.\xe2\x80\x9d He evidently\r\ncomplimented himself upon the modesty of this statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know you won\xe2\x80\x99t run when the time comes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun?\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud one; \xe2\x80\x9crun?\xe2\x80\x94of course not!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the youth, \xe2\x80\x9clots of good-a-\xe2\x80\x99nough men have thought\r\nthey was going to do great things before the fight, but when the time\r\ncome they skedaddled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all true, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going\r\nto skedaddle. The man that bets on my running will lose his money,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t the bravest man in the world,\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the loud soldier indignantly; \xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I was the bravest man in the world, neither. I said I was going to\r\ndo my share of fighting\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said. And I am, too. Who are you,\r\nanyhow? You talk as if you thought you was Napoleon Bonaparte.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nglared at the youth for a moment, and then strode away.\r\n\r\nThe youth called in a savage voice after his comrade: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t git mad about it!\xe2\x80\x9d But the other continued on his way and made\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\nHe felt alone in space when his injured comrade had disappeared. His\r\nfailure to discover any mite of resemblance in their viewpoints made\r\nhim more miserable than before. No one seemed to be wrestling with such\r\na terrific personal problem. He was a mental outcast.\r\n\r\nHe went slowly to his tent and stretched himself on a blanket by the\r\nside of the snoring tall soldier. In the darkness he saw visions of a\r\nthousand-tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to\r\nflee, while others were going coolly about their country\xe2\x80\x99s business. He\r\nadmitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster. He felt\r\nthat every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices, while\r\nother men would remain stolid and deaf.\r\n\r\nAnd as he sweated with the pain of these thoughts, he could hear low,\r\nserene sentences. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bid five.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMake it six.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSeven.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSeven\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at the red, shivering reflection of a fire on the white wall\r\nof his tent until, exhausted and ill from the monotony of his\r\nsuffering, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen another night came, the columns, changed to purple streaks, filed\r\nacross two pontoon bridges. A glaring fire wine-tinted the waters of\r\nthe river. Its rays, shining upon the moving masses of troops, brought\r\nforth here and there sudden gleams of silver or gold. Upon the other\r\nshore a dark and mysterious range of hills was curved against the sky.\r\nThe insect voices of the night sang solemnly.\r\n\r\nAfter this crossing the youth assured himself that at any moment they\r\nmight be suddenly and fearfully assaulted from the caves of the\r\nlowering woods. He kept his eyes watchfully upon the darkness.\r\n\r\nBut his regiment went unmolested to a camping place, and its soldiers\r\nslept the brave sleep of wearied men. In the morning they were routed\r\nout with early energy, and hustled along a narrow road that led deep\r\ninto the forest.\r\n\r\nIt was during this rapid march that the regiment lost many of the marks\r\nof a new command.\r\n\r\nThe men had begun to count the miles upon their fingers, and they grew\r\ntired. \xe2\x80\x9cSore feet an\xe2\x80\x99 damned short rations, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud\r\nsoldier. There was perspiration and grumblings. After a time they began\r\nto shed their knapsacks. Some tossed them unconcernedly down; others\r\nhid them carefully, asserting their plans to return for them at some\r\nconvenient time. Men extricated themselves from thick shirts. Presently\r\nfew carried anything but their necessary clothing, blankets,\r\nhaversacks, canteens, and arms and ammunition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can now eat and\r\nshoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall soldier to the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you want to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was sudden change from the ponderous infantry of theory to the\r\nlight and speedy infantry of practice. The regiment, relieved of a\r\nburden, received a new impetus. But there was much loss of valuable\r\nknapsacks, and, on the whole, very good shirts.\r\n\r\nBut the regiment was not yet veteranlike in appearance. Veteran\r\nregiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men.\r\nOnce, when the command had first come to the field, some perambulating\r\nveterans, noting the length of their column, had accosted them thus:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, fellers, what brigade is that?\xe2\x80\x9d And when the men had replied that\r\nthey formed a regiment and not a brigade, the older soldiers had\r\nlaughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cO Gawd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlso, there was too great a similarity in the hats. The hats of a\r\nregiment should properly represent the history of headgear for a period\r\nof years. And, moreover, there were no letters of faded gold speaking\r\nfrom the colors. They were new and beautiful, and the color bearer\r\nhabitually oiled the pole.\r\n\r\nPresently the army again sat down to think. The odor of the peaceful\r\npines was in the men\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils. The sound of monotonous axe blows rang\r\nthrough the forest, and the insects, nodding upon their perches,\r\ncrooned like old women. The youth returned to his theory of a blue\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nOne gray dawn, however, he was kicked in the leg by the tall soldier,\r\nand then, before he was entirely awake, he found himself running down a\r\nwood road in the midst of men who were panting from the first effects\r\nof speed. His canteen banged rythmically upon his thigh, and his\r\nhaversack bobbed softly. His musket bounced a trifle from his shoulder\r\nat each stride and made his cap feel uncertain upon his head.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the men whisper jerky sentences: \xe2\x80\x9cSay\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94about?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat th\xe2\x80\x99 thunder\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x94skedaddlin\xe2\x80\x99 this way fer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBillie\xe2\x80\x94keep off m\xe2\x80\x99 feet. Yeh run\xe2\x80\x94like a cow.\xe2\x80\x9d And the loud soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshrill voice could be heard: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat th\xe2\x80\x99 devil they in sich a hurry for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth thought the damp fog of early morning moved from the rush of\r\na great body of troops. From the distance came a sudden spatter of\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\nHe was bewildered. As he ran with his comrades he strenuously tried to\r\nthink, but all he knew was that if he fell down those coming behind\r\nwould tread upon him. All his faculties seemed to be needed to guide\r\nhim over and past obstructions. He felt carried along by a mob.\r\n\r\nThe sun spread disclosing rays, and, one by one, regiments burst into\r\nview like armed men just born of the earth. The youth perceived that\r\nthe time had come. He was about to be measured. For a moment he felt in\r\nthe face of his great trial like a babe, and the flesh over his heart\r\nseemed very thin. He seized time to look about him calculatingly.\r\n\r\nBut he instantly saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from\r\nthe regiment. It inclosed him. And there were iron laws of tradition\r\nand law on four sides. He was in a moving box.\r\n\r\nAs he perceived this fact it occurred to him that he had never wished\r\nto come to the war. He had not enlisted of his free will. He had been\r\ndragged by the merciless government. And now they were taking him out\r\nto be slaughtered.\r\n\r\nThe regiment slid down a bank and wallowed across a little stream. The\r\nmournful current moved slowly on, and from the water, shaded black,\r\nsome white bubble eyes looked at the men.\r\n\r\nAs they climbed the hill on the farther side artillery began to boom.\r\nHere the youth forgot many things as he felt a sudden impulse of\r\ncuriosity. He scrambled up the bank with a speed that could not be\r\nexceeded by a bloodthirsty man.\r\n\r\nHe expected a battle scene.\r\n\r\nThere were some little fields girted and squeezed by a forest. Spread\r\nover the grass and in among the tree trunks, he could see knots and\r\nwaving lines of skirmishers who were running hither and thither and\r\nfiring at the landscape. A dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck\r\nclearing that gleamed orange color. A flag fluttered.\r\n\r\nOther regiments floundered up the bank. The brigade was formed in line\r\nof battle, and after a pause started slowly through the woods in the\r\nrear of the receding skirmishers, who were continually melting into the\r\nscene to appear again farther on. They were always busy as bees, deeply\r\nabsorbed in their little combats.\r\n\r\nThe youth tried to observe everything. He did not use care to avoid\r\ntrees and branches, and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking\r\nagainst stones or getting entangled in briers. He was aware that these\r\nbattalions with their commotions were woven red and startling into the\r\ngentle fabric of softened greens and browns. It looked to be a wrong\r\nplace for a battle field.\r\n\r\nThe skirmishers in advance fascinated him. Their shots into thickets\r\nand at distant and prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies\xe2\x80\x94hidden,\r\nmysterious, solemn.\r\n\r\nOnce the line encountered the body of a dead soldier. He lay upon his\r\nback staring at the sky. He was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish\r\nbrown. The youth could see that the soles of his shoes had been worn to\r\nthe thinness of writing paper, and from a great rent in one the dead\r\nfoot projected piteously. And it was as if fate had betrayed the\r\nsoldier. In death it exposed to his enemies that poverty which in life\r\nhe had perhaps concealed from his friends.\r\n\r\nThe ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse. The invulnerable dead\r\nman forced a way for himself. The youth looked keenly at the ashen\r\nface. The wind raised the tawny beard. It moved as if a hand were\r\nstroking it. He vaguely desired to walk around and around the body and\r\nstare; the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer\r\nto the Question.\r\n\r\nDuring the march the ardor which the youth had acquired when out of\r\nview of the field rapidly faded to nothing. His curiosity was quite\r\neasily satisfied. If an intense scene had caught him with its wild\r\nswing as he came to the top of the bank, he might have gone roaring on.\r\nThis advance upon Nature was too calm. He had opportunity to reflect.\r\nHe had time in which to wonder about himself and to attempt to probe\r\nhis sensations.\r\n\r\nAbsurd ideas took hold upon him. He thought that he did not relish the\r\nlandscape. It threatened him. A coldness swept over his back, and it is\r\ntrue that his trousers felt to him that they were no fit for his legs\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nA house standing placidly in distant fields had to him an ominous look.\r\nThe shadows of the woods were formidable. He was certain that in this\r\nvista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts. The swift thought came to him\r\nthat the generals did not know what they were about. It was all a trap.\r\nSuddenly those close forests would bristle with rifle barrels. Ironlike\r\nbrigades would appear in the rear. They were all going to be\r\nsacrificed. The generals were stupids. The enemy would presently\r\nswallow the whole command. He glared about him, expecting to see the\r\nstealthy approach of his death.\r\n\r\nHe thought that he must break from the ranks and harangue his comrades.\r\nThey must not all be killed like pigs; and he was sure it would come to\r\npass unless they were informed of these dangers. The generals were\r\nidiots to send them marching into a regular pen. There was but one pair\r\nof eyes in the corps. He would step forth and make a speech. Shrill and\r\npassionate words came to his lips.\r\n\r\nThe line, broken into moving fragments by the ground, went calmly on\r\nthrough fields and woods. The youth looked at the men nearest him, and\r\nsaw, for the most part, expressions of deep interest, as if they were\r\ninvestigating something that had fascinated them. One or two stepped\r\nwith overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged into war. Others\r\nwalked as upon thin ice. The greater part of the untested men appeared\r\nquiet and absorbed. They were going to look at war, the red animal\xe2\x80\x94war,\r\nthe blood-swollen god. And they were deeply engrossed in this march.\r\n\r\nAs he looked the youth gripped his outcry at his throat. He saw that\r\neven if the men were tottering with fear they would laugh at his\r\nwarning. They would jeer him, and, if practicable, pelt him with\r\nmissiles. Admitting that he might be wrong, a frenzied declamation of\r\nthe kind would turn him into a worm.\r\n\r\nHe assumed, then, the demeanor of one who knows that he is doomed alone\r\nto unwritten responsibilities. He lagged, with tragic glances at the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised presently by the young lieutenant of his company, who\r\nbegan heartily to beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and\r\ninsolent voice: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, young man, get up into ranks there. No skulking\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ll do here.\xe2\x80\x9d He mended his pace with suitable haste. And he hated the\r\nlieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine minds. He was a mere brute.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the brigade was halted in the cathedral light of a forest.\r\nThe busy skirmishers were still popping. Through the aisles of the wood\r\ncould be seen the floating smoke from their rifles. Sometimes it went\r\nup in little balls, white and compact.\r\n\r\nDuring this halt many men in the regiment began erecting tiny hills in\r\nfront of them. They used stones sticks, earth, and anything they\r\nthought might turn a bullet. Some built comparatively large ones, while\r\nothers seems content with little ones.\r\n\r\nThis procedure caused a discussion among the men. Some wished to fight\r\nlike duelists, believing it to be correct to stand erect and be, from\r\ntheir feet to their foreheads, a mark. They said they scorned the\r\ndevices of the cautious. But the others scoffed in reply, and pointed\r\nto the veterans on the flanks who were digging at the ground like\r\nterriers. In a short time there was quite a barricade along the\r\nregimental fronts. Directly, however, they were ordered to withdraw\r\nfrom that place.\r\n\r\nThis astounded the youth. He forgot his stewing over the advance\r\nmovement. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what did they march us out here for?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded of the tall soldier. The latter with calm faith began a heavy\r\nexplanation, although he had been compelled to leave a little\r\nprotection of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much care and\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nWhen the regiment was aligned in another position each man\xe2\x80\x99s regard for\r\nhis safety caused another line of small intrenchments. They ate their\r\nnoon meal behind a third one. They were moved from this one also. They\r\nwere marched from place to place with apparent aimlessness.\r\n\r\nThe youth had been taught that a man became another thing in battle. He\r\nsaw his salvation in such a change. Hence this waiting was an ordeal to\r\nhim. He was in a fever of impatience. He considered that there was\r\ndenoted a lack of purpose on the part of the generals. He began to\r\ncomplain to the tall soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what good it does to make us wear out our legs for\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d He wished to return to camp, knowing that this affair was a\r\nblue demonstration; or else to go into a battle and discover that he\r\nhad been a fool in his doubts, and was, in truth, a man of traditional\r\ncourage. The strain of present circumstances he felt to be intolerable.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical tall soldier measured a sandwich of cracker and pork\r\nand swallowed it in a nonchalant manner. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose we must go\r\nreconnoitering around the country jest to keep \xe2\x80\x99em from getting too\r\nclose, or to develop \xe2\x80\x99em, or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the youth, still fidgeting, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather do anything \xe2\x80\x99most\r\nthan go tramping \xe2\x80\x99round the country all day doing no good to nobody and\r\njest tiring ourselves out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the loud soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t right. I tell you if\r\nanybody with any sense was a-runnin\xe2\x80\x99 this army it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the tall private. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little fool. You little\r\ndamn\xe2\x80\x99 cuss. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t had that there coat and them pants on for six\r\nmonths, and yet you talk as if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wanta do some fighting anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to walk. I could \xe2\x80\x99ave walked to home\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99round an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99round\r\nthe barn, if I jest wanted to walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall one, red-faced, swallowed another sandwich as if taking poison\r\nin despair.\r\n\r\nBut gradually, as he chewed, his face became again quiet and contented.\r\nHe could not rage in fierce argument in the presence of such\r\nsandwiches. During his meals he always wore an air of blissful\r\ncontemplation of the food he had swallowed. His spirit seemed then to\r\nbe communing with the viands.\r\n\r\nHe accepted new environment and circumstance with great coolness,\r\neating from his haversack at every opportunity. On the march he went\r\nalong with the stride of a hunter, objecting to neither gait nor\r\ndistance. And he had not raised his voice when he had been ordered away\r\nfrom three little protective piles of earth and stone, each of which\r\nhad been an engineering feat worthy of being made sacred to the name of\r\nhis grandmother.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, the regiment went out over the same ground it had\r\ntaken in the morning. The landscape then ceased to threaten the youth.\r\nHe had been close to it and become familiar with it.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they began to pass into a new region, his old fears of\r\nstupidity and incompetence reassailed him, but this time he doggedly\r\nlet them babble. He was occupied with his problem, and in his\r\ndesperation he concluded that the stupidity did not greatly matter.\r\n\r\nOnce he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed\r\ndirectly and end his troubles. Regarding death thus out of the corner\r\nof his eye, he conceived it to be nothing but rest, and he was filled\r\nwith a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary\r\ncommotion over the mere matter of getting killed. He would die; he\r\nwould go to some place where he would be understood. It was useless to\r\nexpect appreciation of his profound and fine sense from such men as the\r\nlieutenant. He must look to the grave for comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound. With it was\r\nmingled far-away cheering. A battery spoke.\r\n\r\nDirectly the youth could see the skirmishers running. They were pursued\r\nby the sound of musketry fire. After a time the hot, dangerous flashes\r\nof the rifles were visible. Smoke clouds went slowly and insolently\r\nacross the fields like observant phantoms. The din became crescendo,\r\nlike the roar of an oncoming train.\r\n\r\nA brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a\r\nrending roar. It was as if it had exploded. And thereafter it lay\r\nstretched in the distance behind a long gray wall, that one was obliged\r\nto look twice at to make sure that it was smoke.\r\n\r\nThe youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting killed, gazed spell\r\nbound. His eyes grew wide and busy with the action of the scene. His\r\nmouth was a little ways open.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid upon his shoulder.\r\nAwakening from his trance of observation he turned and beheld the loud\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my first and last battle, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, with intense\r\ngloom. He was quite pale and his girlish lip was trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the youth in great astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my first and last battle, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the loud soldier.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething tells me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a gone coon this first time and\xe2\x80\x94and I w-want you to take these\r\nhere things\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94folks.\xe2\x80\x9d He ended in a quavering sob of pity for\r\nhimself. He handed the youth a little packet done up in a yellow\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the devil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the youth again.\r\n\r\nBut the other gave him a glance as from the depths of a tomb, and\r\nraised his limp hand in a prophetic manner and turned away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brigade was halted in the fringe of a grove. The men crouched among\r\nthe trees and pointed their restless guns out at the fields. They tried\r\nto look beyond the smoke.\r\n\r\nOut of this haze they could see running men. Some shouted information\r\nand gestured as the hurried.\r\n\r\nThe men of the new regiment watched and listened eagerly, while their\r\ntongues ran on in gossip of the battle. They mouthed rumors that had\r\nflown like birds out of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say Perry has been driven in with big loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Carrott went t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 hospital. He said he was sick. That smart\r\nlieutenant is commanding \xe2\x80\x98G\xe2\x80\x99 Company. Th\xe2\x80\x99 boys say they won\xe2\x80\x99t be under\r\nCarrott no more if they all have t\xe2\x80\x99 desert. They allus knew he was a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHannises\xe2\x80\x99 batt\xe2\x80\x99ry is took.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t either. I saw Hannises\xe2\x80\x99 batt\xe2\x80\x99ry off on th\xe2\x80\x99 left not more\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nfifteen minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 general, he ses he is goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 take th\xe2\x80\x99 hull command of th\xe2\x80\x99 304th\r\nwhen we go inteh action, an\xe2\x80\x99 then he ses we\xe2\x80\x99ll do sech fightin\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nnever another one reg\xe2\x80\x99ment done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say we\xe2\x80\x99re catchin\xe2\x80\x99 it over on th\xe2\x80\x99 left. They say th\xe2\x80\x99 enemy driv\xe2\x80\x99\r\nour line inteh a devil of a swamp an\xe2\x80\x99 took Hannises\xe2\x80\x99 batt\xe2\x80\x99ry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sech thing. Hannises\xe2\x80\x99 batt\xe2\x80\x99ry was \xe2\x80\x99long here \xe2\x80\x99bout a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat young Hasbrouck, he makes a good off\xe2\x80\x99cer. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t afraid \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met one of th\xe2\x80\x99 148th Maine boys an\xe2\x80\x99 he ses his brigade fit th\xe2\x80\x99 hull\r\nrebel army fer four hours over on th\xe2\x80\x99 turnpike road an\xe2\x80\x99 killed about\r\nfive thousand of \xe2\x80\x99em. He ses one more sech fight as that an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 war\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ll be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scared either. No, sir! It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that. Bill ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na-gittin\xe2\x80\x99 scared easy. He was jest mad, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was. When that\r\nfeller trod on his hand, he up an\xe2\x80\x99 sed that he was willin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 give his\r\nhand t\xe2\x80\x99 his country, but he be dumbed if he was goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 have every\r\ndumb bushwhacker in th\xe2\x80\x99 kentry walkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99round on it. So he went t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhospital disregardless of th\xe2\x80\x99 fight. Three fingers was crunched. Th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndern doctor wanted t\xe2\x80\x99 amputate \xe2\x80\x99m, an\xe2\x80\x99 Bill, he raised a heluva row, I\r\nhear. He\xe2\x80\x99s a funny feller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe din in front swelled to a tremendous chorus. The youth and his\r\nfellows were frozen to silence. They could see a flag that tossed in\r\nthe smoke angrily. Near it were the blurred and agitated forms of\r\ntroops. There came a turbulent stream of men across the fields. A\r\nbattery changing position at a frantic gallop scattered the stragglers\r\nright and left.\r\n\r\nA shell screaming like a storm banshee went over the huddled heads of\r\nthe reserves. It landed in the grove, and exploding redly flung the\r\nbrown earth. There was a little shower of pine needles.\r\n\r\nBullets began to whistle among the branches and nip at the trees. Twigs\r\nand leaves came sailing down. It was as if a thousand axes, wee and\r\ninvisible, were being wielded. Many of the men were constantly dodging\r\nand ducking their heads.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s company was shot in the hand. He began to\r\nswear so wondrously that a nervous laugh went along the regimental\r\nline. The officer\xe2\x80\x99s profanity sounded conventional. It relieved the\r\ntightened senses of the new men. It was as if he had hit his fingers\r\nwith a tack hammer at home.\r\n\r\nHe held the wounded member carefully away from his side so that the\r\nblood would not drip upon his trousers.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the company, tucking his sword under his arm, produced a\r\nhandkerchief and began to bind with it the lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s wound. And they\r\ndisputed as to how the binding should be done.\r\n\r\nThe battle flag in the distance jerked about madly. It seemed to be\r\nstruggling to free itself from an agony. The billowing smoke was filled\r\nwith horizontal flashes.\r\n\r\nMen rushing swiftly emerged from it. They grew in numbers until it was\r\nseen that the whole command was fleeing. The flag suddenly sank down as\r\nif dying. Its motion as it fell was a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\nWild yells came from behind the walls of smoke. A sketch in gray and\r\nred dissolved into a moblike body of men who galloped like wild horses.\r\nThe veteran regiments on the right and left of the 304th immediately\r\nbegan to jeer. With the passionate song of the bullets and the banshee\r\nshrieks of shells were mingled loud catcalls and bits of facetious\r\nadvice concerning places of safety.\r\n\r\nBut the new regiment was breathless with horror. \xe2\x80\x9cGawd! Saunders\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\ncrushed!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the man at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s elbow. They shrank back and\r\ncrouched as if compelled to await a flood.\r\n\r\nThe youth shot a swift glance along the blue ranks of the regiment. The\r\nprofiles were motionless, carven; and afterward he remembered that the\r\ncolor sergeant was standing with his legs apart, as if he expected to\r\nbe pushed to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe following throng went whirling around the flank. Here and there\r\nwere officers carried along on the stream like exasperated chips. They\r\nwere striking about them with their swords and with their left fists,\r\npunching every head they could reach. They cursed like highwaymen.\r\n\r\nA mounted officer displayed the furious anger of a spoiled child. He\r\nraged with his head, his arms, and his legs.\r\n\r\nAnother, the commander of the brigade, was galloping about bawling. His\r\nhat was gone and his clothes were awry. He resembled a man who has come\r\nfrom bed to go to a fire. The hoofs of his horse often threatened the\r\nheads of the running men, but they scampered with singular fortune. In\r\nthis rush they were apparently all deaf and blind. They heeded not the\r\nlargest and longest of the oaths that were thrown at them from all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nFrequently over this tumult could be heard the grim jokes of the\r\ncritical veterans; but the retreating men apparently were not even\r\nconscious of the presence of an audience.\r\n\r\nThe battle reflection that shone for an instant in the faces on the mad\r\ncurrent made the youth feel that forceful hands from heaven would not\r\nhave been able to have held him in place if he could have got\r\nintelligent control of his legs.\r\n\r\nThere was an appalling imprint upon these faces. The struggle in the\r\nsmoke had pictured an exaggeration of itself on the bleached cheeks and\r\nin the eyes wild with one desire.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this stampede exerted a floodlike force that seemed able\r\nto drag sticks and stones and men from the ground. They of the reserves\r\nhad to hold on. They grew pale and firm, and red and quaking.\r\n\r\nThe youth achieved one little thought in the midst of this chaos. The\r\ncomposite monster which had caused the other troops to flee had not\r\nthen appeared. He resolved to get a view of it, and then, he thought he\r\nmight very likely run better than the best of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were moments of waiting. The youth thought of the village street\r\nat home before the arrival of the circus parade on a day in the spring.\r\nHe remembered how he had stood, a small, thrillful boy, prepared to\r\nfollow the dingy lady upon the white horse, or the band in its faded\r\nchariot. He saw the yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and the\r\nsober houses. He particularly remembered an old fellow who used to sit\r\nupon a cracker box in front of the store and feign to despise such\r\nexhibitions. A thousand details of color and form surged in his mind.\r\nThe old fellow upon the cracker box appeared in middle prominence.\r\n\r\nSome one cried, \xe2\x80\x9cHere they come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was rustling and muttering among the men. They displayed a\r\nfeverish desire to have every possible cartridge ready to their hands.\r\nThe boxes were pulled around into various positions, and adjusted with\r\ngreat care. It was as if seven hundred new bonnets were being tried on.\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier, having prepared his rifle, produced a red\r\nhandkerchief of some kind. He was engaged in knotting it about his\r\nthroat with exquisite attention to its position, when the cry was\r\nrepeated up and down the line in a muffled roar of sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they come! Here they come!\xe2\x80\x9d Gun locks clicked.\r\n\r\nAcross the smoke-infested fields came a brown swarm of running men who\r\nwere giving shrill yells. They came on, stooping and swinging their\r\nrifles at all angles. A flag, tilted forward, sped near the front.\r\n\r\nAs he caught sight of them the youth was momentarily startled by a\r\nthought that perhaps his gun was not loaded. He stood trying to rally\r\nhis faltering intellect so that he might recollect the moment when he\r\nhad loaded, but he could not.\r\n\r\nA hatless general pulled his dripping horse to a stand near the colonel\r\nof the 304th. He shook his fist in the other\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nhold \xe2\x80\x99em back!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, savagely; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hold \xe2\x80\x99em back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his agitation the colonel began to stammer. \xe2\x80\x9cA-all r-right, General,\r\nall right, by Gawd! We-we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our\xe2\x80\x94we-we\xe2\x80\x99ll d-d-do-do our best,\r\nGeneral.\xe2\x80\x9d The general made a passionate gesture and galloped away. The\r\ncolonel, perchance to relieve his feelings, began to scold like a wet\r\nparrot. The youth, turning swiftly to make sure that the rear was\r\nunmolested, saw the commander regarding his men in a highly resentful\r\nmanner, as if he regretted above everything his association with them.\r\n\r\nThe man at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s elbow was mumbling, as if to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin for it now! oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re in for it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain of the company had been pacing excitedly to and fro in the\r\nrear. He coaxed in schoolmistress fashion, as to a congregation of boys\r\nwith primers. His talk was an endless repetition. \xe2\x80\x9cReserve your fire,\r\nboys\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot till I tell you\xe2\x80\x94save your fire\xe2\x80\x94wait till they get\r\nclose up\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be damned fools\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerspiration streamed down the youth\xe2\x80\x99s face, which was soiled like that\r\nof a weeping urchin. He frequently, with a nervous movement, wiped his\r\neyes with his coat sleeve. His mouth was still a little ways open.\r\n\r\nHe got the one glance at the foe-swarming field in front of him, and\r\ninstantly ceased to debate the question of his piece being loaded.\r\nBefore he was ready to begin\xe2\x80\x94before he had announced to himself that he\r\nwas about to fight\xe2\x80\x94he threw the obedient well-balanced rifle into\r\nposition and fired a first wild shot. Directly he was working at his\r\nweapon like an automatic affair.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly lost concern for himself, and forgot to look at a menacing\r\nfate. He became not a man but a member. He felt that something of which\r\nhe was a part\xe2\x80\x94a regiment, an army, a cause, or a country\xe2\x80\x94was in crisis.\r\nHe was welded into a common personality which was dominated by a single\r\ndesire. For some moments he could not flee no more than a little finger\r\ncan commit a revolution from a hand.\r\n\r\nIf he had thought the regiment was about to be annihilated perhaps he\r\ncould have amputated himself from it. But its noise gave him assurance.\r\nThe regiment was like a firework that, once ignited, proceeds superior\r\nto circumstances until its blazing vitality fades. It wheezed and\r\nbanged with a mighty power. He pictured the ground before it as strewn\r\nwith the discomfited.\r\n\r\nThere was a consciousness always of the presence of his comrades about\r\nhim. He felt the subtle battle brotherhood more potent even than the\r\ncause for which they were fighting. It was a mysterious fraternity born\r\nof the smoke and danger of death.\r\n\r\nHe was at a task. He was like a carpenter who has made many boxes,\r\nmaking still another box, only there was furious haste in his\r\nmovements. He, in his thoughts, was careering off in other places, even\r\nas the carpenter who as he works whistles and thinks of his friend or\r\nhis enemy, his home or a saloon. And these jolted dreams were never\r\nperfect to him afterward, but remained a mass of blurred shapes.\r\n\r\nPresently he began to feel the effects of the war atmosphere\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nblistering sweat, a sensation that his eyeballs were about to crack\r\nlike hot stones. A burning roar filled his ears.\r\n\r\nFollowing this came a red rage. He developed the acute exasperation of\r\na pestered animal, a well-meaning cow worried by dogs. He had a mad\r\nfeeling against his rifle, which could only be used against one life at\r\na time. He wished to rush forward and strangle with his fingers. He\r\ncraved a power that would enable him to make a world-sweeping gesture\r\nand brush all back. His impotency appeared to him, and made his rage\r\ninto that of a driven beast.\r\n\r\nBuried in the smoke of many rifles his anger was directed not so much\r\nagainst the men whom he knew were rushing toward him as against the\r\nswirling battle phantoms which were choking him, stuffing their smoke\r\nrobes down his parched throat. He fought frantically for respite for\r\nhis senses, for air, as a babe being smothered attacks the deadly\r\nblankets.\r\n\r\nThere was a blare of heated rage mingled with a certain expression of\r\nintentness on all faces. Many of the men were making low-toned noises\r\nwith their mouths, and these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations,\r\nprayers, made a wild, barbaric song that went as an undercurrent of\r\nsound, strange and chantlike with the resounding chords of the war\r\nmarch. The man at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s elbow was babbling. In it there was\r\nsomething soft and tender like the monologue of a babe. The tall\r\nsoldier was swearing in a loud voice. From his lips came a black\r\nprocession of curious oaths. Of a sudden another broke out in a\r\nquerulous way like a man who has mislaid his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nsupport us? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they send supports? Do they think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth in his battle sleep heard this as one who dozes hears.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular absence of heroic poses. The men bending and\r\nsurging in their haste and rage were in every impossible attitude. The\r\nsteel ramrods clanked and clanged with incessant din as the men pounded\r\nthem furiously into the hot rifle barrels. The flaps of the cartridge\r\nboxes were all unfastened, and bobbed idiotically with each movement.\r\nThe rifles, once loaded, were jerked to the shoulder and fired without\r\napparent aim into the smoke or at one of the blurred and shifting forms\r\nwhich upon the field before the regiment had been growing larger and\r\nlarger like puppets under a magician\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nThe officers, at their intervals, rearward, neglected to stand in\r\npicturesque attitudes. They were bobbing to and fro roaring directions\r\nand encouragements. The dimensions of their howls were extraordinary.\r\nThey expended their lungs with prodigal wills. And often they nearly\r\nstood upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the enemy on the\r\nother side of the tumbling smoke.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s company had encountered a soldier who had\r\nfled screaming at the first volley of his comrades. Behind the lines\r\nthese two were acting a little isolated scene. The man was blubbering\r\nand staring with sheeplike eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him\r\nby the collar and was pommeling him. He drove him back into the ranks\r\nwith many blows. The soldier went mechanically, dully, with his\r\nanimal-like eyes upon the officer. Perhaps there was to him a divinity\r\nexpressed in the voice of the other\xe2\x80\x94stern, hard, with no reflection of\r\nfear in it. He tried to reload his gun, but his shaking hands\r\nprevented. The lieutenant was obliged to assist him.\r\n\r\nThe men dropped here and there like bundles. The captain of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany had been killed in an early part of the action. His body lay\r\nstretched out in the position of a tired man resting, but upon his face\r\nthere was an astonished and sorrowful look, as if he thought some\r\nfriend had done him an ill turn. The babbling man was grazed by a shot\r\nthat made the blood stream widely down his face. He clapped both hands\r\nto his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and ran. Another grunted suddenly as if he\r\nhad been struck by a club in the stomach. He sat down and gazed\r\nruefully. In his eyes there was mute, indefinite reproach. Farther up\r\nthe line a man, standing behind a tree, had had his knee joint\r\nsplintered by a ball. Immediately he had dropped his rifle and gripped\r\nthe tree with both arms. And there he remained, clinging desperately\r\nand crying for assistance that he might withdraw his hold upon the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nAt last an exultant yell went along the quivering line. The firing\r\ndwindled from an uproar to a last vindictive popping. As the smoke\r\nslowly eddied away, the youth saw that the charge had been repulsed.\r\nThe enemy were scattered into reluctant groups. He saw a man climb to\r\nthe top of the fence, straddle the rail, and fire a parting shot. The\r\nwaves had receded, leaving bits of dark _d\xc3\xa9bris_ upon the ground.\r\n\r\nSome in the regiment began to whoop frenziedly. Many were silent.\r\nApparently they were trying to contemplate themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter the fever had left his veins, the youth thought that at last he\r\nwas going to suffocate. He became aware of the foul atmosphere in which\r\nhe had been struggling. He was grimy and dripping like a laborer in a\r\nfoundry. He grasped his canteen and took a long swallow of the warmed\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA sentence with variations went up and down the line. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helt\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em back. We\xe2\x80\x99ve helt \xe2\x80\x99em back; derned if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d The men said it\r\nblissfully, leering at each other with dirty smiles.\r\n\r\nThe youth turned to look behind him and off to the right and off to the\r\nleft. He experienced the joy of a man who at last finds leisure in\r\nwhich to look about him.\r\n\r\nUnder foot there were a few ghastly forms motionless. They lay twisted\r\nin fantastic contortions. Arms were bent and heads were turned in\r\nincredible ways. It seemed that the dead men must have fallen from some\r\ngreat height to get into such positions. They looked to be dumped out\r\nupon the ground from the sky.\r\n\r\nFrom a position in the rear of the grove a battery was throwing shells\r\nover it. The flash of the guns startled the youth at first. He thought\r\nthey were aimed directly at him. Through the trees he watched the black\r\nfigures of the gunners as they worked swiftly and intently. Their labor\r\nseemed a complicated thing. He wondered how they could remember its\r\nformula in the midst of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs. They argued with abrupt\r\nviolence. It was a grim pow-wow. Their busy servants ran hither and\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nA small procession of wounded men were going drearily toward the rear.\r\nIt was a flow of blood from the torn body of the brigade.\r\n\r\nTo the right and to the left were the dark lines of other troops. Far\r\nin front he thought he could see lighter masses protruding in points\r\nfrom the forest. They were suggestive of unnumbered thousands.\r\n\r\nOnce he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line of the horizon.\r\nThe tiny riders were beating the tiny horses.\r\n\r\nFrom a sloping hill came the sound of cheerings and clashes. Smoke\r\nwelled slowly through the leaves.\r\n\r\nBatteries were speaking with thunderous oratorical effort. Here and\r\nthere were flags, the red in the stripes dominating. They splashed bits\r\nof warm color upon the dark lines of troops.\r\n\r\nThe youth felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblems. They were\r\nlike beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.\r\n\r\nAs he listened to the din from the hillside, to a deep pulsating\r\nthunder that came from afar to the left, and to the lesser clamors\r\nwhich came from many directions, it occurred to him that they were\r\nfighting, too, over there, and over there, and over there. Heretofore\r\nhe had supposed that all the battle was directly under his nose.\r\n\r\nAs he gazed around him the youth felt a flash of astonishment at the\r\nblue, pure sky and the sun gleamings on the trees and fields. It was\r\nsurprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden process\r\nin the midst of so much devilment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth awakened slowly. He came gradually back to a position from\r\nwhich he could regard himself. For moments he had been scrutinizing his\r\nperson in a dazed way as if he had never before seen himself. Then he\r\npicked up his cap from the ground. He wriggled in his jacket to make a\r\nmore comfortable fit, and kneeling relaced his shoe. He thoughtfully\r\nmopped his reeking features.\r\n\r\nSo it was all over at last! The supreme trial had been passed. The red,\r\nformidable difficulties of war had been vanquished.\r\n\r\nHe went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction. He had the most\r\ndelightful sensations of his life. Standing as if apart from himself,\r\nhe viewed that last scene. He perceived that the man who had fought\r\nthus was magnificent.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he was a fine fellow. He saw himself even with those\r\nideals which he had considered as far beyond him. He smiled in deep\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\nUpon his fellows he beamed tenderness and good will. \xe2\x80\x9cGee! ain\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nhot, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d he said affably to a man who was polishing his streaming\r\nface with his coat sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, grinning sociably. \xe2\x80\x9cI never seen sech dumb\r\nhotness.\xe2\x80\x9d He sprawled out luxuriously on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cGee, yes! An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nhope we don\xe2\x80\x99t have no more fightin\xe2\x80\x99 till a week from Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were some handshakings and deep speeches with men whose features\r\nwere familiar, but with whom the youth now felt the bonds of tied\r\nhearts. He helped a cursing comrade to bind up a wound of the shin.\r\n\r\nBut, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke out along the ranks of the\r\nnew regiment. \xe2\x80\x9cHere they come ag\xe2\x80\x99in! Here they come ag\xe2\x80\x99in!\xe2\x80\x9d The man who\r\nhad sprawled upon the ground started up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth turned quick eyes upon the field. He discerned forms begin to\r\nswell in masses out of a distant wood. He again saw the tilted flag\r\nspeeding forward.\r\n\r\nThe shells, which had ceased to trouble the regiment for a time, came\r\nswirling again, and exploded in the grass or among the leaves of the\r\ntrees. They looked to be strange war flowers bursting into fierce\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nThe men groaned. The luster faded from their eyes. Their smudged\r\ncountenances now expressed a profound dejection. They moved their\r\nstiffened bodies slowly, and watched in sullen mood the frantic\r\napproach of the enemy. The slaves toiling in the temple of this god\r\nbegan to feel rebellion at his harsh tasks.\r\n\r\nThey fretted and complained each to each. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, say, this is too much of\r\na good thing! Why can\xe2\x80\x99t somebody send us supports?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t never goin\xe2\x80\x99 to stand this second banging. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here\r\nto fight the hull damn\xe2\x80\x99 rebel army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was one who raised a doleful cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Bill Smithers had trod\r\non my hand, insteader me treddin\xe2\x80\x99 on his\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d The sore joints of the\r\nregiment creaked as it painfully floundered into position to repulse.\r\n\r\nThe youth stared. Surely, he thought, this impossible thing was not\r\nabout to happen. He waited as if he expected the enemy to suddenly\r\nstop, apologize, and retire bowing. It was all a mistake.\r\n\r\nBut the firing began somewhere on the regimental line and ripped along\r\nin both directions. The level sheets of flame developed great clouds of\r\nsmoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild wind near the ground for a\r\nmoment, and then rolled through the ranks as through a gate. The clouds\r\nwere tinged an earthlike yellow in the sunrays and in the shadow were a\r\nsorry blue. The flag was sometimes eaten and lost in this mass of\r\nvapor, but more often it projected, sun-touched, resplendent.\r\n\r\nInto the youth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes there came a look that one can see in the orbs of\r\na jaded horse. His neck was quivering with nervous weakness and the\r\nmuscles of his arms felt numb and bloodless. His hands, too, seemed\r\nlarge and awkward as if he was wearing invisible mittens. And there was\r\na great uncertainty about his knee joints.\r\n\r\nThe words that comrades had uttered previous to the firing began to\r\nrecur to him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, say, this is too much of a good thing! What do they\r\ntake us for\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t they send supports? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to fight\r\nthe hull damned rebel army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to exaggerate the endurance, the skill, and the valor of those\r\nwho were coming. Himself reeling from exhaustion, he was astonished\r\nbeyond measure at such persistency. They must be machines of steel. It\r\nwas very gloomy struggling against such affairs, wound up perhaps to\r\nfight until sundown.\r\n\r\nHe slowly lifted his rifle and catching a glimpse of the thickspread\r\nfield he blazed at a cantering cluster. He stopped then and began to\r\npeer as best as he could through the smoke. He caught changing views of\r\nthe ground covered with men who were all running like pursued imps, and\r\nyelling.\r\n\r\nTo the youth it was an onslaught of redoubtable dragons. He became like\r\nthe man who lost his legs at the approach of the red and green monster.\r\nHe waited in a sort of a horrified, listening attitude. He seemed to\r\nshut his eyes and wait to be gobbled.\r\n\r\nA man near him who up to this time had been working feverishly at his\r\nrifle suddenly stopped and ran with howls. A lad whose face had borne\r\nan expression of exalted courage, the majesty of he who dares give his\r\nlife, was, at an instant, smitten abject. He blanched like one who has\r\ncome to the edge of a cliff at midnight and is suddenly made aware.\r\nThere was a revelation. He, too, threw down his gun and fled. There was\r\nno shame in his face. He ran like a rabbit.\r\n\r\nOthers began to scamper away through the smoke. The youth turned his\r\nhead, shaken from his trance by this movement as if the regiment was\r\nleaving him behind. He saw the few fleeting forms.\r\n\r\nHe yelled then with fright and swung about. For a moment, in the great\r\nclamor, he was like a proverbial chicken. He lost the direction of\r\nsafety. Destruction threatened him from all points.\r\n\r\nDirectly he began to speed toward the rear in great leaps. His rifle\r\nand cap were gone. His unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind. The flap of\r\nhis cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen, by its slender cord,\r\nswung out behind. On his face was all the horror of those things which\r\nhe imagined.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant sprang forward bawling. The youth saw his features\r\nwrathfully red, and saw him make a dab with his sword. His one thought\r\nof the incident was that the lieutenant was a peculiar creature to feel\r\ninterested in such matters upon this occasion.\r\n\r\nHe ran like a blind man. Two or three times he fell down. Once he\r\nknocked his shoulder so heavily against a tree that he went headlong.\r\n\r\nSince he had turned his back upon the fight his fears had been\r\nwondrously magnified. Death about to thrust him between the shoulder\r\nblades was far more dreadful than death about to smite him between the\r\neyes. When he thought of it later, he conceived the impression that it\r\nis better to view the appalling than to be merely within hearing. The\r\nnoises of the battle were like stones; he believed himself liable to be\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nAs he ran on he mingled with others. He dimly saw men on his right and\r\non his left, and he heard footsteps behind him. He thought that all the\r\nregiment was fleeing, pursued by those ominous crashes.\r\n\r\nIn his flight the sound of these following footsteps gave him his one\r\nmeager relief. He felt vaguely that death must make a first choice of\r\nthe men who were nearest; the initial morsels for the dragons would be\r\nthen those who were following him. So he displayed the zeal of an\r\ninsane sprinter in his purpose to keep them in the rear. There was a\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAs he, leading, went across a little field, he found himself in a\r\nregion of shells. They hurtled over his head with long wild screams. As\r\nhe listened he imagined them to have rows of cruel teeth that grinned\r\nat him. Once one lit before him and the livid lightning of the\r\nexplosion effectually barred the way in his chosen direction. He\r\ngroveled on the ground and then springing up went careering off through\r\nsome bushes.\r\n\r\nHe experienced a thrill of amazement when he came within view of a\r\nbattery in action. The men there seemed to be in conventional moods,\r\naltogether unaware of the impending annihilation. The battery was\r\ndisputing with a distant antagonist and the gunners were wrapped in\r\nadmiration of their shooting. They were continually bending in coaxing\r\npostures over the guns. They seemed to be patting them on the back and\r\nencouraging them with words. The guns, stolid and undaunted, spoke with\r\ndogged valor.\r\n\r\nThe precise gunners were coolly enthusiastic. They lifted their eyes\r\nevery chance to the smoke-wreathed hillock from whence the hostile\r\nbattery addressed them. The youth pitied them as he ran. Methodical\r\nidiots! Machine-like fools! The refined joy of planting shells in the\r\nmidst of the other battery\xe2\x80\x99s formation would appear a little thing when\r\nthe infantry came swooping out of the woods.\r\n\r\nThe face of a youthful rider, who was jerking his frantic horse with an\r\nabandon of temper he might display in a placid barnyard, was impressed\r\ndeeply upon his mind. He knew that he looked upon a man who would\r\npresently be dead.\r\n\r\nToo, he felt a pity for the guns, standing, six good comrades, in a\r\nbold row.\r\n\r\nHe saw a brigade going to the relief of its pestered fellows. He\r\nscrambled upon a wee hill and watched it sweeping finely, keeping\r\nformation in difficult places. The blue of the line was crusted with\r\nsteel color, and the brilliant flags projected. Officers were shouting.\r\n\r\nThis sight also filled him with wonder. The brigade was hurrying\r\nbriskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths of the war god. What\r\nmanner of men were they, anyhow? Ah, it was some wondrous breed! Or\r\nelse they didn\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend\xe2\x80\x94the fools.\r\n\r\nA furious order caused commotion in the artillery. An officer on a\r\nbounding horse made maniacal motions with his arms. The teams went\r\nswinging up from the rear, the guns were whirled about, and the battery\r\nscampered away. The cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the\r\nground grunted and grumbled like stout men, brave but with objections\r\nto hurry.\r\n\r\nThe youth went on, moderating his pace since he had left the place of\r\nnoises.\r\n\r\nLater he came upon a general of division seated upon a horse that\r\npricked its ears in an interested way at the battle. There was a great\r\ngleaming of yellow and patent leather about the saddle and bridle. The\r\nquiet man astride looked mouse-colored upon such a splendid charger.\r\n\r\nA jingling staff was galloping hither and thither. Sometimes the\r\ngeneral was surrounded by horsemen and at other times he was quite\r\nalone. He looked to be much harassed. He had the appearance of a\r\nbusiness man whose market is swinging up and down.\r\n\r\nThe youth went slinking around this spot. He went as near as he dared\r\ntrying to overhear words. Perhaps the general, unable to comprehend\r\nchaos, might call upon him for information. And he could tell him. He\r\nknew all concerning it. Of a surety the force was in a fix, and any\r\nfool could see that if they did not retreat while they had\r\nopportunity\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe felt that he would like to thrash the general, or at least approach\r\nand tell him in plain words exactly what he thought him to be. It was\r\ncriminal to stay calmly in one spot and make no effort to stay\r\ndestruction. He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division\r\ncommander to apply to him.\r\n\r\nAs he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTompkins, go over an\xe2\x80\x99 see Taylor, an\xe2\x80\x99 tell him not t\xe2\x80\x99 be in such an\r\nall-fired hurry; tell him t\xe2\x80\x99 halt his brigade in th\xe2\x80\x99 edge of th\xe2\x80\x99 woods;\r\ntell him t\xe2\x80\x99 detach a reg\xe2\x80\x99ment\xe2\x80\x94say I think th\xe2\x80\x99 center \xe2\x80\x99ll break if we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t help it out some; tell him t\xe2\x80\x99 hurry up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the\r\nmouth of his superior. He made his horse bound into a gallop almost\r\nfrom a walk in his haste to go upon his mission. There was a cloud of\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nA moment later the youth saw the general bounce excitedly in his\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by heavens, they have!\xe2\x80\x9d The officer leaned forward. His face was\r\naflame with excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, by heavens, they\xe2\x80\x99ve held \xe2\x80\x99im! They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheld \xe2\x80\x99im!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to blithely roar at his staff: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wallop \xe2\x80\x99im now. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwallop \xe2\x80\x99im now. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em sure.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned suddenly upon an aide:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94Jones\xe2\x80\x94quick\xe2\x80\x94ride after Tompkins\xe2\x80\x94see Taylor\xe2\x80\x94tell him t\xe2\x80\x99 go\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94everlastingly\xe2\x80\x94like blazes\xe2\x80\x94anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs another officer sped his horse after the first messenger, the\r\ngeneral beamed upon the earth like a sun. In his eyes was a desire to\r\nchant a paean. He kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve held \xe2\x80\x99em, by heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis excitement made his horse plunge, and he merrily kicked and swore\r\nat it. He held a little carnival of joy on horseback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth cringed as if discovered in a crime. By heavens, they had won\r\nafter all! The imbecile line had remained and become victors. He could\r\nhear cheering.\r\n\r\nHe lifted himself upon his toes and looked in the direction of the\r\nfight. A yellow fog lay wallowing on the treetops. From beneath it came\r\nthe clatter of musketry. Hoarse cries told of an advance.\r\n\r\nHe turned away amazed and angry. He felt that he had been wronged.\r\n\r\nHe had fled, he told himself, because annihilation approached. He had\r\ndone a good part in saving himself, who was a little piece of the army.\r\nHe had considered the time, he said, to be one in which it was the duty\r\nof every little piece to rescue itself if possible. Later the officers\r\ncould fit the little pieces together again, and make a battle front. If\r\nnone of the little pieces were wise enough to save themselves from the\r\nflurry of death at such a time, why, then, where would be the army? It\r\nwas all plain that he had proceeded according to very correct and\r\ncommendable rules. His actions had been sagacious things. They had been\r\nfull of strategy. They were the work of a master\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\nThoughts of his comrades came to him. The brittle blue line had\r\nwithstood the blows and won. He grew bitter over it. It seemed that the\r\nblind ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had betrayed him.\r\nHe had been overturned and crushed by their lack of sense in holding\r\nthe position, when intelligent deliberation would have convinced them\r\nthat it was impossible. He, the enlightened man who looks afar in the\r\ndark, had fled because of his superior perceptions and knowledge. He\r\nfelt a great anger against his comrades. He knew it could be proved\r\nthat they had been fools.\r\n\r\nHe wondered what they would remark when later he appeared in camp. His\r\nmind heard howls of derision. Their density would not enable them to\r\nunderstand his sharper point of view.\r\n\r\nHe began to pity himself acutely. He was ill used. He was trodden\r\nbeneath the feet of an iron injustice. He had proceeded with wisdom and\r\nfrom the most righteous motives under heaven\xe2\x80\x99s blue only to be\r\nfrustrated by hateful circumstances.\r\n\r\nA dull, animal-like rebellion against his fellows, war in the abstract,\r\nand fate grew within him. He shambled along with bowed head, his brain\r\nin a tumult of agony and despair. When he looked loweringly up,\r\nquivering at each sound, his eyes had the expression of those of a\r\ncriminal who thinks his guilt little and his punishment great, and\r\nknows that he can find no words.\r\n\r\nHe went from the fields into a thick woods, as if resolved to bury\r\nhimself. He wished to get out of hearing of the crackling shots which\r\nwere to him like voices.\r\n\r\nThe ground was cluttered with vines and bushes, and the trees grew\r\nclose and spread out like bouquets. He was obliged to force his way\r\nwith much noise. The creepers, catching against his legs, cried out\r\nharshly as their sprays were torn from the barks of trees. The swishing\r\nsaplings tried to make known his presence to the world. He could not\r\nconciliate the forest. As he made his way, it was always calling out\r\nprotestations. When he separated embraces of trees and vines the\r\ndisturbed foliages waved their arms and turned their face leaves toward\r\nhim. He dreaded lest these noisy motions and cries should bring men to\r\nlook at him. So he went far, seeking dark and intricate places.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the sound of musketry grew faint and the cannon boomed in\r\nthe distance. The sun, suddenly apparent, blazed among the trees. The\r\ninsects were making rhythmical noises. They seemed to be grinding their\r\nteeth in unison. A woodpecker stuck his impudent head around the side\r\nof a tree. A bird flew on lighthearted wing.\r\n\r\nOff was the rumble of death. It seemed now that Nature had no ears.\r\n\r\nThis landscape gave him assurance. A fair field holding life. It was\r\nthe religion of peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to\r\nsee blood. He conceived Nature to be a woman with a deep aversion to\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nHe threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering\r\nfear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously\r\nfrom behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation.\r\n\r\nThe youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he\r\nsaid. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon\r\nrecognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand\r\nstolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward\r\nglance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast\r\nas his legs could carry him; and he was but an ordinary squirrel,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94doubtless no philosopher of his race. The youth wended, feeling\r\nthat Nature was of his mind. She re-enforced his argument with proofs\r\nthat lived where the sun shone.\r\n\r\nOnce he found himself almost into a swamp. He was obliged to walk upon\r\nbog tufts and watch his feet to keep from the oily mire. Pausing at one\r\ntime to look about him he saw, out at some black water, a small animal\r\npounce in and emerge directly with a gleaming fish.\r\n\r\nThe youth went again into the deep thickets. The brushed branches made\r\na noise that drowned the sounds of cannon. He walked on, going from\r\nobscurity into promises of a greater obscurity.\r\n\r\nAt length he reached a place where the high, arching boughs made a\r\nchapel. He softly pushed the green doors aside and entered. Pine\r\nneedles were a gentle brown carpet. There was a religious half light.\r\n\r\nNear the threshold he stopped, horror-stricken at the sight of a thing.\r\n\r\nHe was being looked at by a dead man who was seated with his back\r\nagainst a columnlike tree. The corpse was dressed in a uniform that had\r\nonce been blue, but was now faded to a melancholy shade of green. The\r\neyes, staring at the youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on\r\nthe side of a dead fish. The mouth was open. Its red had changed to an\r\nappalling yellow. Over the gray skin of the face ran little ants. One\r\nwas trundling some sort of bundle along the upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe youth gave a shriek as he confronted the thing. He was for moments\r\nturned to stone before it. He remained staring into the liquid-looking\r\neyes. The dead man and the living man exchanged a long look. Then the\r\nyouth cautiously put one hand behind him and brought it against a tree.\r\nLeaning upon this he retreated, step by step, with his face still\r\ntoward the thing. He feared that if he turned his back the body might\r\nspring up and stealthily pursue him.\r\n\r\nThe branches, pushing against him, threatened to throw him over upon\r\nit. His unguided feet, too, caught aggravatingly in brambles; and with\r\nit all he received a subtle suggestion to touch the corpse. As he\r\nthought of his hand upon it he shuddered profoundly.\r\n\r\nAt last he burst the bonds which had fastened him to the spot and fled,\r\nunheeding the underbrush. He was pursued by the sight of black ants\r\nswarming greedily upon the gray face and venturing horribly near to the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he paused, and, breathless and panting, listened. He\r\nimagined some strange voice would come from the dead throat and squawk\r\nafter him in horrible menaces.\r\n\r\nThe trees about the portal of the chapel moved soughingly in a soft\r\nwind. A sad silence was upon the little guarding edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees began softly to sing a hymn of twilight. The sun sank until\r\nslanted bronze rays struck the forest. There was a lull in the noises\r\nof insects as if they had bowed their beaks and were making a\r\ndevotional pause. There was silence save for the chanted chorus of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThen, upon this stillness, there suddenly broke a tremendous clangor of\r\nsounds. A crimson roar came from the distance.\r\n\r\nThe youth stopped. He was transfixed by this terrific medley of all\r\nnoises. It was as if worlds were being rended. There was the ripping\r\nsound of musketry and the breaking crash of the artillery.\r\n\r\nHis mind flew in all directions. He conceived the two armies to be at\r\neach other panther fashion. He listened for a time. Then he began to\r\nrun in the direction of the battle. He saw that it was an ironical\r\nthing for him to be running thus toward that which he had been at such\r\npains to avoid. But he said, in substance, to himself that if the earth\r\nand the moon were about to clash, many persons would doubtless plan to\r\nget upon the roofs to witness the collision.\r\n\r\nAs he ran, he became aware that the forest had stopped its music, as if\r\nat last becoming capable of hearing the foreign sounds. The trees\r\nhushed and stood motionless. Everything seemed to be listening to the\r\ncrackle and clatter and earthshaking thunder. The chorus peaked over\r\nthe still earth.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to the youth that the fight in which he had been\r\nwas, after all, but perfunctory popping. In the hearing of this present\r\ndin he was doubtful if he had seen real battle scenes. This uproar\r\nexplained a celestial battle; it was tumbling hordes a-struggle in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nReflecting, he saw a sort of a humor in the point of view of himself\r\nand his fellows during the late encounter. They had taken themselves\r\nand the enemy very seriously and had imagined that they were deciding\r\nthe war. Individuals must have supposed that they were cutting the\r\nletters of their names deep into everlasting tablets of brass, or\r\nenshrining their reputations forever in the hearts of their countrymen,\r\nwhile, as to fact, the affair would appear in printed reports under a\r\nmeek and immaterial title. But he saw that it was good, else, he said,\r\nin battle every one would surely run save forlorn hopes and their ilk.\r\n\r\nHe went rapidly on. He wished to come to the edge of the forest that he\r\nmight peer out.\r\n\r\nAs he hastened, there passed through his mind pictures of stupendous\r\nconflicts. His accumulated thought upon such subjects was used to form\r\nscenes. The noise was as the voice of an eloquent being, describing.\r\n\r\nSometimes the brambles formed chains and tried to hold him back. Trees,\r\nconfronting him, stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass.\r\nAfter its previous hostility this new resistance of the forest filled\r\nhim with a fine bitterness. It seemed that Nature could not be quite\r\nready to kill him.\r\n\r\nBut he obstinately took roundabout ways, and presently he was where he\r\ncould see long gray walls of vapor where lay battle lines. The voices\r\nof cannon shook him. The musketry sounded in long irregular surges that\r\nplayed havoc with his ears. He stood regardant for a moment. His eyes\r\nhad an awestruck expression. He gawked in the direction of the fight.\r\n\r\nPresently he proceeded again on his forward way. The battle was like\r\nthe grinding of an immense and terrible machine to him. Its\r\ncomplexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated him. He must go\r\nclose and see it produce corpses.\r\n\r\nHe came to a fence and clambered over it. On the far side, the ground\r\nwas littered with clothes and guns. A newspaper, folded up, lay in the\r\ndirt. A dead soldier was stretched with his face hidden in his arm.\r\nFarther off there was a group of four or five corpses keeping mournful\r\ncompany. A hot sun had blazed upon this spot.\r\n\r\nIn this place the youth felt that he was an invader. This forgotten\r\npart of the battle ground was owned by the dead men, and he hurried, in\r\nthe vague apprehension that one of the swollen forms would rise and\r\ntell him to begone.\r\n\r\nHe came finally to a road from which he could see in the distance dark\r\nand agitated bodies of troops, smoke-fringed. In the lane was a\r\nblood-stained crowd streaming to the rear. The wounded men were\r\ncursing, groaning, and wailing. In the air, always, was a mighty swell\r\nof sound that it seemed could sway the earth. With the courageous words\r\nof the artillery and the spiteful sentences of the musketry mingled red\r\ncheers. And from this region of noises came the steady current of the\r\nmaimed.\r\n\r\nOne of the wounded men had a shoeful of blood. He hopped like a\r\nschoolboy in a game. He was laughing hysterically.\r\n\r\nOne was swearing that he had been shot in the arm through the\r\ncommanding general\xe2\x80\x99s mismanagement of the army. One was marching with\r\nan air imitative of some sublime drum major. Upon his features was an\r\nunholy mixture of merriment and agony. As he marched he sang a bit of\r\ndoggerel in a high and quavering voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing a song \xe2\x80\x99a vic\xe2\x80\x99try,\r\n    A pocketful \xe2\x80\x99a bullets,\r\nFive an\xe2\x80\x99 twenty dead men\r\n    Baked in a\xe2\x80\x94pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nParts of the procession limped and staggered to this tune.\r\n\r\nAnother had the gray seal of death already upon his face. His lips were\r\ncurled in hard lines and his teeth were clinched. His hands were bloody\r\nfrom where he had pressed them upon his wound. He seemed to be awaiting\r\nthe moment when he should pitch headlong. He stalked like the specter\r\nof a soldier, his eyes burning with the power of a stare into the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThere were some who proceeded sullenly, full of anger at their wounds,\r\nand ready to turn upon anything as an obscure cause.\r\n\r\nAn officer was carried along by two privates. He was peevish. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njoggle so, Johnson, yeh fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThink m\xe2\x80\x99 leg is made of iron?\r\nIf yeh can\xe2\x80\x99t carry me decent, put me down an\xe2\x80\x99 let some one else do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bellowed at the tottering crowd who blocked the quick march of his\r\nbearers. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, make way there, can\xe2\x80\x99t yeh? Make way, dickens take it\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sulkily parted and went to the roadsides. As he was carried past\r\nthey made pert remarks to him. When he raged in reply and threatened\r\nthem, they told him to be damned.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder of one of the tramping bearers knocked heavily against the\r\nspectral soldier who was staring into the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe youth joined this crowd and marched along with it. The torn bodies\r\nexpressed the awful machinery in which the men had been entangled.\r\n\r\nOrderlies and couriers occasionally broke through the throng in the\r\nroadway, scattering wounded men right and left, galloping on followed\r\nby howls. The melancholy march was continually disturbed by the\r\nmessengers, and sometimes by bustling batteries that came swinging and\r\nthumping down upon them, the officers shouting orders to clear the way.\r\n\r\nThere was a tattered man, fouled with dust, blood and powder stain from\r\nhair to shoes, who trudged quietly at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s side. He was\r\nlistening with eagerness and much humility to the lurid descriptions of\r\na bearded sergeant. His lean features wore an expression of awe and\r\nadmiration. He was like a listener in a country store to wondrous tales\r\ntold among the sugar barrels. He eyed the story-teller with unspeakable\r\nwonder. His mouth was agape in yokel fashion.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, taking note of this, gave pause to his elaborate history\r\nwhile he administered a sardonic comment. \xe2\x80\x9cBe keerful, honey, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\na-ketchin\xe2\x80\x99 flies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe tattered man shrank back abashed.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he began to sidle near to the youth, and in a diffident\r\nway try to make him a friend. His voice was gentle as a girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nand his eyes were pleading. The youth saw with surprise that the\r\nsoldier had two wounds, one in the head, bound with a blood-soaked rag,\r\nand the other in the arm, making that member dangle like a broken\r\nbough.\r\n\r\nAfter they had walked together for some time the tattered man mustered\r\nsufficient courage to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cWas pretty good fight, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ntimidly said. The youth, deep in thought, glanced up at the bloody and\r\ngrim figure with its lamblike eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas pretty good fight, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth shortly. He quickened his pace.\r\n\r\nBut the other hobbled industriously after him. There was an air of\r\napology in his manner, but he evidently thought that he needed only to\r\ntalk for a time, and the youth would perceive that he was a good\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas pretty good fight, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a small voice, and the\r\nhe achieved the fortitude to continue. \xe2\x80\x9cDern me if I ever see fellers\r\nfight so. Laws, how they did fight! I knowed th\xe2\x80\x99 boys\xe2\x80\x99d like it when\r\nthey onct got square at it. Th\xe2\x80\x99 boys ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no fair chanct up t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow, but this time they showed what they was. I knowed it\xe2\x80\x99d turn out\r\nthis way. Yeh can\xe2\x80\x99t lick them boys. No, sir! They\xe2\x80\x99re fighters, they\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe breathed a deep breath of humble admiration. He had looked at the\r\nyouth for encouragement several times. He received none, but gradually\r\nhe seemed to get absorbed in his subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99cross pickets with a boy from Georgie, onct, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nboy, he ses, \xe2\x80\x98Your fellers \xe2\x80\x99ll all run like hell when they onct hearn a\r\ngun,\xe2\x80\x99 he ses. \xe2\x80\x98Mebbe they will,\xe2\x80\x99 I ses, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t b\xe2\x80\x99lieve none of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 I ses; \xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99jiminey,\xe2\x80\x99 I ses back t\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99um, \xe2\x80\x98mebbe your fellers \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nall run like hell when they onct hearn a gun,\xe2\x80\x99 I ses. He larfed. Well,\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t run t\xe2\x80\x99 day, did they, hey? No, sir! They fit, an\xe2\x80\x99 fit, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis homely face was suffused with a light of love for the army which\r\nwas to him all things beautiful and powerful.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he turned to the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere yeh hit, ol\xe2\x80\x99 boy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nin a brotherly tone.\r\n\r\nThe youth felt instant panic at this question, although at first its\r\nfull import was not borne in upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere yeh hit?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the tattered man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d began the youth, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away suddenly and slid through the crowd. His brow was\r\nheavily flushed, and his fingers were picking nervously at one of his\r\nbuttons. He bent his head and fastened his eyes studiously upon the\r\nbutton as if it were a little problem.\r\n\r\nThe tattered man looked after him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth fell back in the procession until the tattered soldier was\r\nnot in sight. Then he started to walk on with the others.\r\n\r\nBut he was amid wounds. The mob of men was bleeding. Because of the\r\ntattered soldier\xe2\x80\x99s question he now felt that his shame could be viewed.\r\nHe was continually casting sidelong glances to see if the men were\r\ncontemplating the letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.\r\n\r\nAt times he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way. He\r\nconceived persons with torn bodies to be peculiarly happy. He wished\r\nthat he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage.\r\n\r\nThe spectral soldier was at his side like a stalking reproach. The\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were still fixed in a stare into the unknown. His gray,\r\nappalling face had attracted attention in the crowd, and men, slowing\r\nto his dreary pace, were walking with him. They were discussing his\r\nplight, questioning him and giving him advice. In a dogged way he\r\nrepelled them, signing to them to go on and leave him alone. The\r\nshadows of his face were deepening and his tight lips seemed holding in\r\ncheck the moan of great despair. There could be seen a certain\r\nstiffness in the movements of his body, as if he were taking infinite\r\ncare not to arouse the passion of his wounds. As he went on, he seemed\r\nalways looking for a place, like one who goes to choose a grave.\r\n\r\nSomething in the gesture of the man as he waved the bloody and pitying\r\nsoldiers away made the youth start as if bitten. He yelled in horror.\r\nTottering forward he laid a quivering hand upon the man\xe2\x80\x99s arm. As the\r\nlatter slowly turned his waxlike features toward him the youth\r\nscreamed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGawd! Jim Conklin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier made a little commonplace smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe youth swayed on his legs and glared strangely. He stuttered and\r\nstammered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94oh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94oh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier held out his gory hand. There was a curious red and\r\nblack combination of new blood and old blood upon it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere yeh been,\r\nHenry?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He continued in a monotonous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought mebbe\r\nyeh got keeled over. There  been thunder t\xe2\x80\x99 pay t\xe2\x80\x99-day. I was worryin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout it a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth still lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94oh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94oh, Jim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall soldier, \xe2\x80\x9cI was out there.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a careful\r\ngesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99, Lord, what a circus! An\xe2\x80\x99, b\xe2\x80\x99jiminey, I got shot\xe2\x80\x94I got\r\nshot. Yes, b\xe2\x80\x99jiminey, I got shot.\xe2\x80\x9d He reiterated this fact in a\r\nbewildered way, as if he did not know how it came about.\r\n\r\nThe youth put forth anxious arms to assist him, but the tall soldier\r\nwent firmly as if propelled. Since the youth\xe2\x80\x99s arrival as a guardian\r\nfor his friend, the other wounded men had ceased to display much\r\ninterest. They occupied themselves again in dragging their own\r\ntragedies toward the rear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as the two friends marched on, the tall soldier seemed to be\r\novercome by a tremor. His face turned to a semblance of gray paste. He\r\nclutched the youth\xe2\x80\x99s arm and looked all about him, as if dreading to be\r\noverheard. Then he began to speak in a shaking whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell yeh what I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid of, Henry\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell yeh what I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid of.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll fall down\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 them yeh know\xe2\x80\x94them damned artillery\r\nwagons\xe2\x80\x94they like as not \xe2\x80\x99ll run over me. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth cried out to him hysterically: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of yeh, Jim!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of yeh! I swear t\xe2\x80\x99 Gawd I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure\xe2\x80\x94will yeh, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d the tall soldier beseeched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I tell yeh\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of yeh, Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d protested the youth.\r\nHe could not speak accurately because of the gulpings in his throat.\r\n\r\nBut the tall soldier continued to beg in a lowly way. He now hung\r\nbabelike to the youth\xe2\x80\x99s arm. His eyes rolled in the wildness of his\r\nterror. \xe2\x80\x9cI was allus a good friend t\xe2\x80\x99 yeh, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I, Henry? I\xe2\x80\x99ve allus\r\nbeen a pretty good feller, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I? An\xe2\x80\x99 it ain\xe2\x80\x99t much t\xe2\x80\x99 ask, is it?\r\nJest t\xe2\x80\x99 pull me along outer th\xe2\x80\x99 road? I\xe2\x80\x99d do it fer you, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I,\r\nHenry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused in piteous anxiety to await his friend\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\nThe youth had reached an anguish where the sobs scorched him. He strove\r\nto express his loyalty, but he could only make fantastic gestures.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tall soldier seemed suddenly to forget all those fears. He\r\nbecame again the grim, stalking specter of a soldier. He went stonily\r\nforward. The youth wished his friend to lean upon him, but the other\r\nalways shook his head and strangely protested. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94leave me\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94leave me be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis look was fixed again upon the unknown. He moved with mysterious\r\npurpose, and all of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s offers he brushed aside. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94leave\r\nme be\xe2\x80\x94leave me be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth had to follow.\r\n\r\nPresently the latter heard a voice talking softly near his shoulder.\r\nTurning he saw that it belonged to the tattered soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\ntake \xe2\x80\x99im outa th\xe2\x80\x99 road, pardner. There\xe2\x80\x99s a batt\xe2\x80\x99ry comin\xe2\x80\x99 helitywhoop\r\ndown th\xe2\x80\x99 road an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll git runned over. He\xe2\x80\x99s a goner anyhow in about\r\nfive minutes\xe2\x80\x94yeh kin see that. Ye\xe2\x80\x99d better take \xe2\x80\x99im outa th\xe2\x80\x99 road.\r\nWhere th\xe2\x80\x99 blazes does hi git his stren\xe2\x80\x99th from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord knows!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the youth. He was shaking his hands helplessly.\r\n\r\nHe ran forward presently and grasped the tall soldier by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cJim!\r\nJim!\xe2\x80\x9d he coaxed, \xe2\x80\x9ccome with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself free. \xe2\x80\x9cHuh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nvacantly. He stared at the youth for a moment. At last he spoke as if\r\ndimly comprehending. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Inteh th\xe2\x80\x99 fields? Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started blindly through the grass.\r\n\r\nThe youth turned once to look at the lashing riders and jouncing guns\r\nof the battery. He was startled from this view by a shrill outcry from\r\nthe tattered man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGawd! He\xe2\x80\x99s runnin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning his head swiftly, the youth saw his friend running in a\r\nstaggering and stumbling way toward a little clump of bushes. His heart\r\nseemed to wrench itself almost free from his body at this sight. He\r\nmade a noise of pain. He and the tattered man began a pursuit. There\r\nwas a singular race.\r\n\r\nWhen he overtook the tall soldier he began to plead with all the words\r\nhe could find. \xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x94Jim\xe2\x80\x94what are you doing\xe2\x80\x94what makes you do this\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt yerself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same purpose was in the tall soldier\xe2\x80\x99s face. He protested in a\r\ndulled way, keeping his eyes fastened on the mystic place of his\r\nintentions. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tech me\xe2\x80\x94leave me be\xe2\x80\x94leave me be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth, aghast and filled with wonder at the tall soldier, began\r\nquaveringly to question him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99, Jim? What you thinking\r\nabout? Where you going? Tell me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier faced about as upon relentless pursuers. In his eyes\r\nthere was a great appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me be, can\xe2\x80\x99t yeh? Leave me be for a\r\nminnit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth recoiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a dazed way, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier turned and, lurching dangerously, went on. The youth\r\nand the tattered soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling\r\nunable to face the stricken man if he should again confront them. They\r\nbegan to have thoughts of a solemn ceremony. There was something\r\nrite-like in these movements of the doomed soldier. And there was a\r\nresemblance in him to a devotee of a mad religion, blood-sucking,\r\nmuscle-wrenching, bone-crushing. They were awed and afraid. They hung\r\nback lest he have at command a dreadful weapon.\r\n\r\nAt last, they saw him stop and stand motionless. Hastening up, they\r\nperceived that his face wore an expression telling that he had at last\r\nfound the place for which he had struggled. His spare figure was erect;\r\nhis bloody hands were quietly at his side. He was waiting with patience\r\nfor something that he had come to meet. He was at the rendezvous. They\r\npaused and stood, expectant.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\nFinally, the chest of the doomed soldier began to heave with a strained\r\nmotion. It increased in violence until it was as if an animal was\r\nwithin and was kicking and tumbling furiously to be free.\r\n\r\nThis spectacle of gradual strangulation made the youth writhe, and once\r\nas his friend rolled his eyes, he saw something in them that made him\r\nsink wailing to the ground. He raised his voice in a last supreme call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x94Jim\xe2\x80\x94Jim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall soldier opened his lips and spoke. He made a gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave\r\nme be\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tech me\xe2\x80\x94leave me be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another silence while he waited.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his form stiffened and straightened. Then it was shaken by a\r\nprolonged ague. He stared into space. To the two watchers there was a\r\ncurious and profound dignity in the firm lines of his awful face.\r\n\r\nHe was invaded by a creeping strangeness that slowly enveloped him. For\r\na moment the tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of hideous\r\nhornpipe. His arms beat wildly about his head in expression of implike\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHis tall figure stretched itself to its full height. There was a slight\r\nrending sound. Then it began to swing forward, slow and straight, in\r\nthe manner of a falling tree. A swift muscular contortion made the left\r\nshoulder strike the ground first.\r\n\r\nThe body seemed to bounce a little way from the earth. \xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntattered soldier.\r\n\r\nThe youth had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of\r\nmeeting. His face had been twisted into an expression of every agony he\r\nhad imagined for his friend.\r\n\r\nHe now sprang to his feet and, going closer, gazed upon the pastelike\r\nface. The mouth was open and the teeth showed in a laugh.\r\n\r\nAs the flap of the blue jacket fell away from the body, he could see\r\nthat the side looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.\r\n\r\nThe youth turned, with sudden, livid rage, toward the battlefield. He\r\nshook his fist. He seemed about to deliver a philippic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tattered man stood musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar jim-dandy fer nerve, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t he,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\r\nfinally in a little awestruck voice. \xe2\x80\x9cA reg\xe2\x80\x99lar jim-dandy.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nthoughtfully poked one of the docile hands with his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonner\r\nwhere he got \xe2\x80\x99is stren\xe2\x80\x99th from? I never seen a man do like that before.\r\nIt was a funny thing. Well, he was a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar jim-dandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth desired to screech out his grief. He was stabbed, but his\r\ntongue lay dead in the tomb of his mouth. He threw himself again upon\r\nthe ground and began to brood.\r\n\r\nThe tattered man stood musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook-a-here, pardner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a time. He regarded the corpse\r\nas he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s up an\xe2\x80\x99 gone, ain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e, an\xe2\x80\x99 we might as well begin t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlook out fer ol\xe2\x80\x99 number one. This here thing is all over. He\xe2\x80\x99s up an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngone, ain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e? An\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s all right here. Nobody won\xe2\x80\x99t bother \xe2\x80\x99im. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nmust say I ain\xe2\x80\x99t enjoying any great health m\xe2\x80\x99self these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth, awakened by the tattered soldier\xe2\x80\x99s tone, looked quickly up.\r\nHe saw that he was swinging uncertainly on his legs and that his face\r\nhad turned to a shade of blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94not you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tattered man waved his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNary die,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want is\r\nsome pea soup an\xe2\x80\x99 a good bed. Some pea soup,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated dreamfully.\r\n\r\nThe youth arose from the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where he came from. I left\r\nhim over there.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I find \xe2\x80\x99im here. And he was\r\ncoming from over there, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated a new direction. They both\r\nturned toward the body as if to ask of it a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d at length spoke the tattered man, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use in our\r\nstayin\xe2\x80\x99 here an\xe2\x80\x99 tryin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 ask him anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth nodded an assent wearily. They both turned to gaze for a\r\nmoment at the corpse.\r\n\r\nThe youth murmured something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was a jim-dandy, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tattered man as if in\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nThey turned their backs upon it and started away. For a time they stole\r\nsoftly, treading with their toes. It remained laughing there in the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m commencin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 feel pretty bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tattered man, suddenly\r\nbreaking one of his little silences. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m commencin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 feel pretty\r\ndamn\xe2\x80\x99 bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d He wondered if he was to be the tortured\r\nwitness of another grim encounter.\r\n\r\nBut his companion waved his hand reassuringly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndie yit! There too much dependin\xe2\x80\x99 on me fer me t\xe2\x80\x99 die yit. No, sir!\r\nNary die!

That was th\xe2\x80\x99 funniest\r\nthing. I\xe2\x80\x99d jest flop down, I would. I never seen a feller die th\xe2\x80\x99 way\r\nthat feller did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh know Tom Jamison, he lives next door t\xe2\x80\x99 me up home. He\xe2\x80\x99s a nice\r\nfeller, he is, an\xe2\x80\x99 we was allus good friends. Smart, too. Smart as a\r\nsteel trap.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve an idee I\xe2\x80\x99d a been fightin\xe2\x80\x99 yit, if t\xe2\x80\x99wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfer Tom Jamison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he made a calm announcement: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s two of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94little ones\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 have fun with me now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I kin walk\r\nmuch furder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went slowly on in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYeh look pretty peek\xe2\x80\x99ed yerself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe tattered man at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet yeh\xe2\x80\x99ve got a worser one than yeh\r\nthink. Ye\xe2\x80\x99d better take keer of yer hurt. It don\xe2\x80\x99t do t\xe2\x80\x99 let sech\r\nthings go. It might be inside mostly, an\xe2\x80\x99 them plays thunder. Where is\r\nit located?\xe2\x80\x9d But he continued his harangue without waiting for a reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a feller git hit plum in th\xe2\x80\x99 head when my reg\xe2\x80\x99ment was\r\na-standin\xe2\x80\x99 at ease onct. An\xe2\x80\x99 everybody yelled to \xe2\x80\x99im: \xe2\x80\x98Hurt, John? Are\r\nyeh hurt much?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 ses he. He looked kinder surprised, an\xe2\x80\x99 he went\r\non tellin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em how he felt. He sed he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel nothin\xe2\x80\x99. But, by dad,\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 first thing that feller knowed he was dead. Yes, he was dead\xe2\x80\x94stone\r\ndead. So, yeh wanta watch out. Yeh might have some queer kind \xe2\x80\x99a hurt\r\nyerself. Yeh can\xe2\x80\x99t never tell. Where is your\xe2\x80\x99n located?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth had been wriggling since the introduction of this topic. He\r\nnow gave a cry of exasperation and made a furious motion with his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He was enraged against the tattered\r\nman, and could have strangled him. His companions seemed ever to play\r\nintolerable parts. They were ever upraising the ghost of shame on the\r\nstick of their curiosity. He turned toward the tattered man as one at\r\nbay. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated with desperate menace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lord knows I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanta bother anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. There\r\nwas a little accent of despair in his voice as he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cLord knows\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve gota \xe2\x80\x99nough m\xe2\x80\x99 own t\xe2\x80\x99 tend to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth, who had been holding a bitter debate with himself and\r\ncasting glances of hatred and contempt at the tattered man, here spoke\r\nin a hard voice. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe tattered man looked at him in gaping amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why, pardner,\r\nwhere yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked unsteadily. The youth looking at him, could\r\nsee that he, too, like that other one, was beginning to act dumb and\r\nanimal-like. His thoughts seemed to be floundering about in his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94look\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94here, you Tom Jamison\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have this\xe2\x80\x94this here\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do. Where\xe2\x80\x94where yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth pointed vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cOver there,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now look\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x94now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tattered man, rambling on in\r\nidiot fashion. His head was hanging forward and his words were slurred.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing won\xe2\x80\x99t do, now, Tom Jamison. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I know yeh, yeh\r\npig-headed devil. Yeh wanta go trompin\xe2\x80\x99 off with a bad hurt. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94Tom Jamison\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Yeh wanta leave me take keer of yeh,\r\nTom Jamison. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94right\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94fer yeh t\xe2\x80\x99 go\xe2\x80\x94trompin\xe2\x80\x99 off\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nbad hurt\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t right\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn reply the youth climbed a fence and started away. He could hear the\r\ntattered man bleating plaintively.\r\n\r\nOnce he faced about angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94here, now, Tom Jamison\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth went on. Turning at a distance he saw the tattered man\r\nwandering about helplessly in the field.\r\n\r\nHe now thought that he wished he was dead. He believed he envied those\r\nmen whose bodies lay strewn over the grass of the fields and on the\r\nfallen leaves of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe simple questions of the tattered man had been knife thrusts to him.\r\nThey asserted a society that probes pitilessly at secrets until all is\r\napparent. His late companion\xe2\x80\x99s chance persistency made him feel that he\r\ncould not keep his crime concealed in his bosom. It was sure to be\r\nbrought plain by one of those arrows which cloud the air and are\r\nconstantly pricking, discovering, proclaiming those things which are\r\nwilled to be forever hidden. He admitted that he could not defend\r\nhimself against this agency. It was not within the power of vigilance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe became aware that the furnace roar of the battle was growing louder.\r\nGreat blown clouds had floated to the still heights of air before him.\r\nThe noise, too, was approaching. The woods filtered men and the fields\r\nbecame dotted.\r\n\r\nAs he rounded a hillock, he perceived that the roadway was now a crying\r\nmass of wagons, teams, and men. From the heaving tangle issued\r\nexhortations, commands, imprecations. Fear was sweeping it all along.\r\nThe cracking whips bit and horses plunged and tugged. The white-topped\r\nwagons strained and stumbled in their exertions like fat sheep.\r\n\r\nThe youth felt comforted in a measure by this sight. They were all\r\nretreating. Perhaps, then, he was not so bad after all. He seated\r\nhimself and watched the terror-stricken wagons. They fled like soft,\r\nungainly animals. All the roarers and lashers served to help him to\r\nmagnify the dangers and horrors of the engagement that he might try to\r\nprove to himself that the thing with which men could charge him was in\r\ntruth a symmetrical act. There was an amount of pleasure to him in\r\nwatching the wild march of this vindication.\r\n\r\nPresently the calm head of a forward-going column of infantry appeared\r\nin the road. It came swiftly on. Avoiding the obstructions gave it the\r\nsinuous movement of a serpent. The men at the head butted mules with\r\ntheir musket stocks. They prodded teamsters indifferent to all howls.\r\nThe men forced their way through parts of the dense mass by strength.\r\nThe blunt head of the column pushed. The raving teamsters swore many\r\nstrange oaths.\r\n\r\nThe commands to make way had the ring of a great importance in them.\r\nThe men were going forward to the heart of the din. They were to\r\nconfront the eager rush of the enemy. They felt the pride of their\r\nonward movement when the remainder of the army seemed trying to dribble\r\ndown this road. They tumbled teams about with a fine feeling that it\r\nwas no matter so long as their column got to the front in time. This\r\nimportance made their faces grave and stern. And the backs of the\r\nofficers were very rigid.\r\n\r\nAs the youth looked at them the black weight of his woe returned to\r\nhim. He felt that he was regarding a procession of chosen beings. The\r\nseparation was as great to him as if they had marched with weapons of\r\nflame and banners of sunlight. He could never be like them. He could\r\nhave wept in his longings.\r\n\r\nHe searched about in his mind for an adequate malediction for the\r\nindefinite cause, the thing upon which men turn the words of final\r\nblame. It\xe2\x80\x94whatever it was\xe2\x80\x94was responsible for him, he said. There lay\r\nthe fault.\r\n\r\nThe haste of the column to reach the battle seemed to the forlorn young\r\nman to be something much finer than stout fighting. Heroes, he thought,\r\ncould find excuses in that long seething lane. They could retire with\r\nperfect self-respect and make excuses to the stars.\r\n\r\nHe wondered what those men had eaten that they could be in such haste\r\nto force their way to grim chances of death. As he watched his envy\r\ngrew until he thought that he wished to change lives with one of them.\r\nHe would have liked to have used a tremendous force, he said, throw off\r\nhimself and become a better. Swift pictures of himself, apart, yet in\r\nhimself, came to him\xe2\x80\x94a blue desperate figure leading lurid charges with\r\none knee forward and a broken blade high\xe2\x80\x94a blue, determined figure\r\nstanding before a crimson and steel assault, getting calmly killed on a\r\nhigh place before the eyes of all. He thought of the magnificent pathos\r\nof his dead body.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts uplifted him. He felt the quiver of war desire. In his\r\nears, he heard the ring of victory. He knew the frenzy of a rapid\r\nsuccessful charge. The music of the trampling feet, the sharp voices,\r\nthe clanking arms of the column near him made him soar on the red wings\r\nof war. For a few moments he was sublime.\r\n\r\nHe thought that he was about to start for the front. Indeed, he saw a\r\npicture of himself, dust-stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front\r\nat the proper moment to seize and throttle the dark, leering witch of\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nThen the difficulties of the thing began to drag at him. He hesitated,\r\nbalancing awkwardly on one foot.\r\n\r\nHe had no rifle; he could not fight with his hands, said he resentfully\r\nto his plan. Well, rifles could be had for the picking. They were\r\nextraordinarily profuse.\r\n\r\nAlso, he continued, it would be a miracle if he found his regiment.\r\nWell, he could fight with any regiment.\r\n\r\nHe started forward slowly. He stepped as if he expected to tread upon\r\nsome explosive thing. Doubts and he were struggling.\r\n\r\nHe would truly be a worm if any of his comrades should see him\r\nreturning thus, the marks of his flight upon him. There was a reply\r\nthat the intent fighters did not care for what happened rearward saving\r\nthat no hostile bayonets appeared there. In the battle-blur his face\r\nwould, in a way, be hidden, like the face of a cowled man.\r\n\r\nBut then he said that his tireless fate would bring forth, when the\r\nstrife lulled for a moment, a man to ask of him an explanation. In\r\nimagination he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he painfully\r\nlabored through some lies.\r\n\r\nEventually, his courage expended itself upon these objections. The\r\ndebates drained him of his fire.\r\n\r\nHe was not cast down by this defeat of his plan, for, upon studying the\r\naffair carefully, he could not but admit that the objections were very\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, various ailments had begun to cry out. In their presence\r\nhe could not persist in flying high with the wings of war; they\r\nrendered it almost impossible for him to see himself in a heroic light.\r\nHe tumbled headlong.\r\n\r\nHe discovered that he had a scorching thirst. His face was so dry and\r\ngrimy that he thought he could feel his skin crackle. Each bone of his\r\nbody had an ache in it, and seemingly threatened to break with each\r\nmovement. His feet were like two sores. Also, his body was calling for\r\nfood. It was more powerful than a direct hunger. There was a dull,\r\nweight-like feeling in his stomach, and, when he tried to walk, his\r\nhead swayed and he tottered. He could not see with distinctness. Small\r\npatches of green mist floated before his vision.\r\n\r\nWhile he had been tossed by many emotions, he had not been aware of\r\nailments. Now they beset him and made clamor. As he was at last\r\ncompelled to pay attention to them, his capacity for self-hate was\r\nmultiplied. In despair, he declared that he was not like those others.\r\nHe now conceded it to be impossible that he should ever become a hero.\r\nHe was a craven loon. Those pictures of glory were piteous things. He\r\ngroaned from his heart and went staggering off.\r\n\r\nA certain mothlike quality within him kept him in the vicinity of the\r\nbattle. He had a great desire to see, and to get news. He wished to\r\nknow who was winning.\r\n\r\nHe told himself that, despite his unprecedented suffering, he had never\r\nlost his greed for a victory, yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner\r\nto his conscience, he could not but know that a defeat for the army\r\nthis time might mean many favorable things for him. The blows of the\r\nenemy would splinter regiments into fragments. Thus, many men of\r\ncourage, he considered, would be obliged to desert the colors and\r\nscurry like chickens. He would appear as one of them. They would be\r\nsullen brothers in distress, and he could then easily believe he had\r\nnot run any farther or faster than they. And if he himself could\r\nbelieve in his virtuous perfection, he conceived that there would be\r\nsmall trouble in convincing all others.\r\n\r\nHe said, as if in excuse for this hope, that previously the army had\r\nencountered great defeats and in a few months had shaken off all blood\r\nand tradition of them, emerging as bright and valiant as a new one;\r\nthrusting out of sight the memory of disaster, and appearing with the\r\nvalor and confidence of unconquered legions. The shrilling voices of\r\nthe people at home would pipe dismally for a time, but various generals\r\nwere usually compelled to listen to these ditties. He of course felt no\r\ncompunctions for proposing a general as a sacrifice. He could not tell\r\nwho the chosen for the barbs might be, so he could center no direct\r\nsympathy upon him. The people were afar and he did not conceive public\r\nopinion to be accurate at long range. It was quite probable they would\r\nhit the wrong man who, after he had recovered from his amazement would\r\nperhaps spend the rest of his days in writing replies to the songs of\r\nhis alleged failure. It would be very unfortunate, no doubt, but in\r\nthis case a general was of no consequence to the youth.\r\n\r\nIn a defeat there would be a roundabout vindication of himself. He\r\nthought it would prove, in a manner, that he had fled early because of\r\nhis superior powers of perception. A serious prophet upon predicting a\r\nflood should be the first man to climb a tree. This would demonstrate\r\nthat he was indeed a seer.\r\n\r\nA moral vindication was regarded by the youth as a very important\r\nthing. Without salve, he could not, he thought, wear the sore badge of\r\nhis dishonor through life. With his heart continually assuring him that\r\nhe was despicable, he could not exist without making it, through his\r\nactions, apparent to all men.\r\n\r\nIf the army had gone gloriously on he would be lost. If the din meant\r\nthat now his army\xe2\x80\x99s flags were tilted forward he was a condemned\r\nwretch. He would be compelled to doom himself to isolation. If the men\r\nwere advancing, their indifferent feet were trampling upon his chances\r\nfor a successful life.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he turned upon them\r\nand tried to thrust them away. He denounced himself as a villain. He\r\nsaid that he was the most unutterably selfish man in existence. His\r\nmind pictured the soldiers who would place their defiant bodies before\r\nthe spear of the yelling battle fiend, and as he saw their dripping\r\ncorpses on an imagined field, he said that he was their murderer.\r\n\r\nAgain he thought that he wished he was dead. He believed that he envied\r\na corpse. Thinking of the slain, he achieved a great contempt for some\r\nof them, as if they were guilty for thus becoming lifeless. They might\r\nhave been killed by lucky chances, he said, before they had had\r\nopportunities to flee or before they had been really tested. Yet they\r\nwould receive laurels from tradition. He cried out bitterly that their\r\ncrowns were stolen and their robes of glorious memories were shams.\r\nHowever, he still said that it was a great pity he was not as they.\r\n\r\nA defeat of the army had suggested itself to him as a means of escape\r\nfrom the consequences of his fall. He considered, now, however, that it\r\nwas useless to think of such a possibility. His education had been that\r\nsuccess for that mighty blue machine was certain; that it would make\r\nvictories as a contrivance turns out buttons. He presently discarded\r\nall his speculations in the other direction. He returned to the creed\r\nof soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen he perceived again that it was not possible for the army to be\r\ndefeated, he tried to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take\r\nback to his regiment, and with it turn the expected shafts of derision.\r\n\r\nBut, as he mortally feared these shafts, it became impossible for him\r\nto invent a tale he felt he could trust. He experimented with many\r\nschemes, but threw them aside one by one as flimsy. He was quick to see\r\nvulnerable places in them all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he was much afraid that some arrow of scorn might lay him\r\nmentally low before he could raise his protecting tale.\r\n\r\nHe imagined the whole regiment saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Henry Fleming? He run,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e? Oh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d He recalled various persons who would be quite sure\r\nto leave him no peace about it. They would doubtless question him with\r\nsneers, and laugh at his stammering hesitation. In the next engagement\r\nthey would try to keep watch of him to discover when he would run.\r\n\r\nWherever he went in camp, he would encounter insolent and lingeringly\r\ncruel stares. As he imagined himself passing near a crowd of comrades,\r\nhe could hear one say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as if the heads were moved by one muscle, all the faces were\r\nturned toward him with wide, derisive grins. He seemed to hear some one\r\nmake a humorous remark in a low tone. At it the others all crowed and\r\ncackled. He was a slang phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe column that had butted stoutly at the obstacles in the roadway was\r\nbarely out of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s sight before he saw dark waves of men come\r\nsweeping out of the woods and down through the fields. He knew at once\r\nthat the steel fibers had been washed from their hearts. They were\r\nbursting from their coats and their equipments as from entanglements.\r\nThey charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.\r\n\r\nBehind them blue smoke curled and clouded above the treetops, and\r\nthrough the thickets he could sometimes see a distant pink glare. The\r\nvoices of the cannon were clamoring in interminable chorus.\r\n\r\nThe youth was horrorstricken. He stared in agony and amazement. He\r\nforgot that he was engaged in combating the universe. He threw aside\r\nhis mental pamphlets on the philosophy of the retreated and rules for\r\nthe guidance of the damned.\r\n\r\nThe fight was lost. The dragons were coming with invincible strides.\r\nThe army, helpless in the matted thickets and blinded by the\r\noverhanging night, was going to be swallowed. War, the red animal, war,\r\nthe blood-swollen god, would have bloated fill.\r\n\r\nWithin him something bade to cry out. He had the impulse to make a\r\nrallying speech, to sing a battle hymn, but he could only get his\r\ntongue to call into the air: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon he was in the midst of them. They were leaping and scampering all\r\nabout him. Their blanched faces shone in the dusk. They seemed, for the\r\nmost part, to be very burly men. The youth turned from one to another\r\nof them as they galloped along. His incoherent questions were lost.\r\nThey were heedless of his appeals. They did not seem to see him.\r\n\r\nThey sometimes gabbled insanely. One huge man was asking of the sky:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, where de plank road? Where de plank road!\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if he had\r\nlost a child. He wept in his pain and dismay.\r\n\r\nPresently, men were running hither and thither in all ways. The\r\nartillery booming, forward, rearward, and on the flanks made jumble of\r\nideas of direction. Landmarks had vanished into the gathered gloom. The\r\nyouth began to imagine that he had got into the center of the\r\ntremendous quarrel, and he could perceive no way out of it. From the\r\nmouths of the fleeing men came a thousand wild questions, but no one\r\nmade answers.\r\n\r\nThe youth, after rushing about and throwing interrogations at the\r\nheedless bands of retreating infantry, finally clutched a man by the\r\narm. They swung around face to face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the youth struggling with his balking tongue.\r\n\r\nThe man screamed: \xe2\x80\x9cLet go me! Let go me!\xe2\x80\x9d His face was livid and his\r\neyes were rolling uncontrolled. He was heaving and panting. He still\r\ngrasped his rifle, perhaps having forgotten to release his hold upon\r\nit. He tugged frantically, and the youth being compelled to lean\r\nforward was dragged several paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet go me! Let go me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d bawled the man in a lurid rage. He adroitly and fiercely\r\nswung his rifle. It crushed upon the youth\xe2\x80\x99s head. The man ran on.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s fingers had turned to paste upon the other\xe2\x80\x99s arm. The\r\nenergy was smitten from his muscles. He saw the flaming wings of\r\nlightning flash before his vision. There was a deafening rumble of\r\nthunder within his head.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his legs seemed to die. He sank writhing to the ground. He\r\ntried to arise. In his efforts against the numbing pain he was like a\r\nman wrestling with a creature of the air.\r\n\r\nThere was a sinister struggle.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would achieve a position half erect, battle with the air\r\nfor a moment, and then fall again, grabbing at the grass. His face was\r\nof a clammy pallor. Deep groans were wrenched from him.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a twisting movement, he got upon his hands and knees, and\r\nfrom thence, like a babe trying to walk, to his feet. Pressing his\r\nhands to his temples he went lurching over the grass.\r\n\r\nHe fought an intense battle with his body. His dulled senses wished him\r\nto swoon and he opposed them stubbornly, his mind portraying unknown\r\ndangers and mutilations if he should fall upon the field. He went tall\r\nsoldier fashion. He imagined secluded spots where he could fall and be\r\nunmolested. To search for one he strove against the tide of pain.\r\n\r\nOnce he put his hand to the top of his head and timidly touched the\r\nwound. The scratching pain of the contact made him draw a long breath\r\nthrough his clinched teeth. His fingers were dabbled with blood. He\r\nregarded them with a fixed stare.\r\n\r\nAround him he could hear the grumble of jolted cannon as the scurrying\r\nhorses were lashed toward the front. Once, a young officer on a\r\nbesplashed charger nearly ran him down. He turned and watched the mass\r\nof guns, men, and horses sweeping in a wide curve toward a gap in a\r\nfence. The officer was making excited motions with a gauntleted hand.\r\nThe guns followed the teams with an air of unwillingness, of being\r\ndragged by the heels.\r\n\r\nSome officers of the scattered infantry were cursing and railing like\r\nfishwives. Their scolding voices could be heard above the din. Into the\r\nunspeakable jumble in the roadway rode a squadron of cavalry. The faded\r\nyellow of their facings shone bravely. There was a mighty altercation.\r\n\r\nThe artillery were assembling as if for a conference.\r\n\r\nThe blue haze of evening was upon the field. The lines of forest were\r\nlong purple shadows. One cloud lay along the western sky partly\r\nsmothering the red.\r\n\r\nAs the youth left the scene behind him, he heard the guns suddenly roar\r\nout. He imagined them shaking in black rage. They belched and howled\r\nlike brass devils guarding a gate. The soft air was filled with the\r\ntremendous remonstrance. With it came the shattering peal of opposing\r\ninfantry. Turning to look behind him, he could see sheets of orange\r\nlight illumine the shadowy distance. There were subtle and sudden\r\nlightnings in the far air. At times he thought he could see heaving\r\nmasses of men.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on in the dusk. The day had faded until he could barely\r\ndistinguish place for his feet. The purple darkness was filled with men\r\nwho lectured and jabbered. Sometimes he could see them gesticulating\r\nagainst the blue and somber sky. There seemed to be a great ruck of men\r\nand munitions spread about in the forest and in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe little narrow roadway now lay lifeless. There were overturned\r\nwagons like sun-dried bowlders. The bed of the former torrent was\r\nchoked with the bodies of horses and splintered parts of war machines.\r\n\r\nIt had come to pass that his wound pained him but little. He was afraid\r\nto move rapidly, however, for a dread of disturbing it. He held his\r\nhead very still and took many precautions against stumbling. He was\r\nfilled with anxiety, and his face was pinched and drawn in anticipation\r\nof the pain of any sudden mistake of his feet in the gloom.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently upon his hurt. There was a\r\ncool, liquid feeling about it and he imagined blood moving slowly down\r\nunder his hair. His head seemed swollen to a size that made him think\r\nhis neck to be inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe new silence of his wound made much worriment. The little blistering\r\nvoices of pain that had called out from his scalp were, he thought,\r\ndefinite in their expression of danger. By them he believed he could\r\nmeasure his plight. But when they remained ominously silent he became\r\nfrightened and imagined terrible fingers that clutched into his brain.\r\n\r\nAmid it he began to reflect upon various incidents and conditions of\r\nthe past. He bethought him of certain meals his mother had cooked at\r\nhome, in which those dishes of which he was particularly fond had\r\noccupied prominent positions. He saw the spread table. The pine walls\r\nof the kitchen were glowing in the warm light from the stove. Too, he\r\nremembered how he and his companions used to go from the school-house\r\nto the bank of a shaded pool. He saw his clothes in disorderly array\r\nupon the grass of the bank. He felt the swash of the fragrant water\r\nupon his body. The leaves of the overhanging maple rustled with melody\r\nin the wind of youthful summer.\r\n\r\nHe was overcome presently by a dragging weariness. His head hung\r\nforward and his shoulders were stooped as if he were bearing a great\r\nbundle. His feet shuffled along the ground.\r\n\r\nHe held continuous arguments as to whether he should lie down and sleep\r\nat some near spot, or force himself on until he reached a certain\r\nhaven. He often tried to dismiss the question, but his body persisted\r\nin rebellion and his senses nagged at him like pampered babies.\r\n\r\nAt last he heard a cheery voice near his shoulder: \xe2\x80\x9cYeh seem t\xe2\x80\x99 be in a\r\npretty bad way, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth did not look up, but he assented with thick tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cUh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owner of the cheery voice took him firmly by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a round laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 your way. Th\xe2\x80\x99 hull gang is goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour way. An\xe2\x80\x99 I guess I kin give yeh a lift.\xe2\x80\x9d They began to walk like a\r\ndrunken man and his friend.\r\n\r\nAs they went along, the man questioned the youth and assisted him with\r\nthe replies like one manipulating the mind of a child. Sometimes he\r\ninterjected anecdotes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat reg\xe2\x80\x99ment do yeh b\xe2\x80\x99long teh? Eh? What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat? Th\xe2\x80\x99 304th N\xe2\x80\x99 York? Why, what corps is that in? Oh, it is? Why, I\r\nthought they wasn\xe2\x80\x99t engaged t\xe2\x80\x99-day-they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x99way over in th\xe2\x80\x99 center. Oh,\r\nthey was, eh? Well pretty nearly everybody got their share \xe2\x80\x99a fightin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99-day. By dad, I give myself up fer dead any number \xe2\x80\x99a times. There\r\nwas shootin\xe2\x80\x99 here an\xe2\x80\x99 shootin\xe2\x80\x99 there, an\xe2\x80\x99 hollerin\xe2\x80\x99 here an\xe2\x80\x99 hollerin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere, in th\xe2\x80\x99 damn\xe2\x80\x99 darkness, until I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell t\xe2\x80\x99 save m\xe2\x80\x99 soul\r\nwhich side I was on. Sometimes I thought I was sure \xe2\x80\x99nough from Ohier,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 other times I could \xe2\x80\x99a swore I was from th\xe2\x80\x99 bitter end of Florida.\r\nIt was th\xe2\x80\x99 most mixed up dern thing I ever see. An\xe2\x80\x99 these here hull\r\nwoods is a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar mess. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a miracle if we find our reg\xe2\x80\x99ments\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99-night. Pretty soon, though, we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet a-plenty of guards an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nprovost-guards, an\xe2\x80\x99 one thing an\xe2\x80\x99 another. Ho! there they go with an\r\noff\xe2\x80\x99cer, I guess. Look at his hand a-draggin\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99s got all th\xe2\x80\x99 war he\r\nwants, I bet. He won\xe2\x80\x99t be talkin\xe2\x80\x99 so big about his reputation an\xe2\x80\x99 all\r\nwhen they go t\xe2\x80\x99 sawin\xe2\x80\x99 off his leg. Poor feller! My brother\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nwhiskers jest like that. How did yeh git \xe2\x80\x99way over here, anyhow? Your\r\nreg\xe2\x80\x99ment is a long way from here, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? Well, I guess we can find\r\nit. Yeh know there was a boy killed in my comp\xe2\x80\x99ny t\xe2\x80\x99-day that I thought\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 world an\xe2\x80\x99 all of. Jack was a nice feller. By ginger, it hurt like\r\nthunder t\xe2\x80\x99 see ol\xe2\x80\x99 Jack jest git knocked flat. We was a-standin\xe2\x80\x99 purty\r\npeaceable fer a spell, \xe2\x80\x99though there was men runnin\xe2\x80\x99 ev\xe2\x80\x99ry way all\r\n\xe2\x80\x99round us, an\xe2\x80\x99 while we was a-standin\xe2\x80\x99 like that, \xe2\x80\x99long come a big fat\r\nfeller. He began t\xe2\x80\x99 peck at Jack\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, an\xe2\x80\x99 he ses: \xe2\x80\x98Say, where\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroad t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 river?\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 Jack, he never paid no attention, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeller kept on a-peckin\xe2\x80\x99 at his elbow an\xe2\x80\x99 sayin\xe2\x80\x99: \xe2\x80\x98Say, where\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroad t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 river?\xe2\x80\x99 Jack was a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 ahead all th\xe2\x80\x99 time tryin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 see\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 Johnnies comin\xe2\x80\x99 through th\xe2\x80\x99 woods, an\xe2\x80\x99 he never paid no attention\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 this big fat feller fer a long time, but at last he turned \xe2\x80\x99round\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 he ses: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, go t\xe2\x80\x99 hell an\xe2\x80\x99 find th\xe2\x80\x99 road t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 river!\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 jest\r\nthen a shot slapped him bang on th\xe2\x80\x99 side th\xe2\x80\x99 head. He was a sergeant,\r\ntoo. Them was his last words. Thunder, I wish we was sure \xe2\x80\x99a findin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nour reg\xe2\x80\x99ments t\xe2\x80\x99-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 be long huntin\xe2\x80\x99. But I guess we\r\nkin do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the search which followed, the man of the cheery voice seemed to the\r\nyouth to possess a wand of a magic kind. He threaded the mazes of the\r\ntangled forest with a strange fortune. In encounters with guards and\r\npatrols he displayed the keenness of a detective and the valor of a\r\ngamin. Obstacles fell before him and became of assistance. The youth,\r\nwith his chin still on his breast, stood woodenly by while his\r\ncompanion beat ways and means out of sullen things.\r\n\r\nThe forest seemed a vast hive of men buzzing about in frantic circles,\r\nbut the cheery man conducted the youth without mistakes, until at last\r\nhe began to chuckle with glee and self-satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, there yeh\r\nare! See that fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth nodded stupidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s where your reg\xe2\x80\x99ment is. An\xe2\x80\x99 now, good-by, ol\xe2\x80\x99 boy, good\r\nluck t\xe2\x80\x99 yeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA warm and strong hand clasped the youth\xe2\x80\x99s languid fingers for an\r\ninstant, and then he heard a cheerful and audacious whistling as the\r\nman strode away. As he who had so befriended him was thus passing out\r\nof his life, it suddenly occurred to the youth that he had not once\r\nseen his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth went slowly toward the fire indicated by his departed friend.\r\nAs he reeled, he bethought him of the welcome his comrades would give\r\nhim. He had a conviction that he would soon feel in his sore heart the\r\nbarbed missiles of ridicule. He had no strength to invent a tale; he\r\nwould be a soft target.\r\n\r\nHe made vague plans to go off into the deeper darkness and hide, but\r\nthey were all destroyed by the voices of exhaustion and pain from his\r\nbody. His ailments, clamoring, forced him to seek the place of food and\r\nrest, at whatever cost.\r\n\r\nHe swung unsteadily toward the fire. He could see the forms of men\r\nthrowing black shadows in the red light, and as he went nearer it\r\nbecame known to him in some way that the ground was strewn with\r\nsleeping men.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he confronted a black and monstrous figure. A rifle barrel\r\ncaught some glinting beams. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt! halt!\xe2\x80\x9d He was dismayed for a moment,\r\nbut he presently thought that he recognized the nervous voice. As he\r\nstood tottering before the rifle barrel, he called out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hello,\r\nWilson, you\xe2\x80\x94you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rifle was lowered to a position of caution and the loud soldier\r\ncame slowly forward. He peered into the youth\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you,\r\nHenry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, ol\xe2\x80\x99 boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cby ginger, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad t\xe2\x80\x99 see yeh!\r\nI give yeh up fer a goner. I thought yeh was dead sure enough.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas husky emotion in his voice.\r\n\r\nThe youth found that now he could barely stand upon his feet. There was\r\na sudden sinking of his forces. He thought he must hasten to produce\r\nhis tale to protect him from the missiles already on the lips of his\r\nredoubtable comrades. So, staggering before the loud soldier, he began:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had an awful time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been all over. Way over on\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 right. Ter\xe2\x80\x99ble fightin\xe2\x80\x99 over there. I had an awful time. I got\r\nseparated from the reg\xe2\x80\x99ment. Over on th\xe2\x80\x99 right, I got shot. In th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhead. I never see sech fightin\xe2\x80\x99. Awful time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I could a\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngot separated from th\xe2\x80\x99 reg\xe2\x80\x99ment. I got shot, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend had stepped forward quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Got shot? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t yeh\r\nsay so first? Poor ol\xe2\x80\x99 boy, we must\xe2\x80\x94hol\xe2\x80\x99 on a minnit; what am I doin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call Simpson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother figure at that moment loomed in the gloom. They could see that\r\nit was the corporal. \xe2\x80\x9cWho yeh talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to, Wilson?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. His\r\nvoice was anger-toned. \xe2\x80\x9cWho yeh talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to? Yeh th\xe2\x80\x99 derndest\r\nsentinel\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94hello, Henry, you here? Why, I thought you was dead four\r\nhours ago! Great Jerusalem, they keep turnin\xe2\x80\x99 up every ten minutes or\r\nso! We thought we\xe2\x80\x99d lost forty-two men by straight count, but if they\r\nkeep on a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 this way, we\xe2\x80\x99ll git th\xe2\x80\x99 comp\xe2\x80\x99ny all back by mornin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyit. Where was yeh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver on th\xe2\x80\x99 right. I got separated\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94began the youth with considerable\r\nglibness.\r\n\r\nBut his friend had interrupted hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, an\xe2\x80\x99 he got shot in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhead an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s in a fix, an\xe2\x80\x99 we must see t\xe2\x80\x99 him right away.\xe2\x80\x9d He rested\r\nhis rifle in the hollow of his left arm and his right around the\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, it must hurt like thunder!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe youth leaned heavily upon his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it hurts\xe2\x80\x94hurts a good\r\ndeal,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. There was a faltering in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal. He linked his arm in the youth\xe2\x80\x99s and drew him\r\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Henry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take keer \xe2\x80\x99a yeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they went on together the loud private called out after them: \xe2\x80\x9cPut\r\n\xe2\x80\x99im t\xe2\x80\x99 sleep in my blanket, Simpson. An\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94hol\xe2\x80\x99 on a minnit\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\ncanteen. It\xe2\x80\x99s full \xe2\x80\x99a coffee. Look at his head by th\xe2\x80\x99 fire an\xe2\x80\x99 see how\r\nit looks. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty bad un. When I git relieved in a couple\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a minnits, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be over an\xe2\x80\x99 see t\xe2\x80\x99 him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s senses were so deadened that his friend\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounded\r\nfrom afar and he could scarcely feel the pressure of the corporal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm. He submitted passively to the latter\xe2\x80\x99s directing strength. His\r\nhead was in the old manner hanging forward upon his breast. His knees\r\nwobbled.\r\n\r\nThe corporal led him into the glare of the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s have look at yer ol\xe2\x80\x99 head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth sat obediently and the corporal, laying aside his rifle,\r\nbegan to fumble in the bushy hair of his comrade. He was obliged to\r\nturn the other\xe2\x80\x99s head so that the full flush of the fire light would\r\nbeam upon it. He puckered his mouth with a critical air. He drew back\r\nhis lips and whistled through his teeth when his fingers came in\r\ncontact with the splashed blood and the rare wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He awkwardly made further investigations.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJest as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, presently. \xe2\x80\x9cYeh\xe2\x80\x99ve been grazed by a\r\nball. It\xe2\x80\x99s raised a queer lump jest as if some feller had lammed yeh on\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 head with a club. It stopped a-bleedin\xe2\x80\x99 long time ago. Th\xe2\x80\x99 most\r\nabout it is that in th\xe2\x80\x99 mornin\xe2\x80\x99 yeh\xe2\x80\x99ll fell that a number ten hat\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit yeh. An\xe2\x80\x99 your head\xe2\x80\x99ll be all het up an\xe2\x80\x99 feel as dry as\r\nburnt pork. An\xe2\x80\x99 yeh may git a lot \xe2\x80\x99a other sicknesses, too, by mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nYeh can\xe2\x80\x99t never tell. Still, I don\xe2\x80\x99t much think so. It\xe2\x80\x99s jest a damn\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngood belt on th\xe2\x80\x99 head, an\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99 more. Now, you jest sit here an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t move, while I go rout out th\xe2\x80\x99 relief. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Wilson t\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntake keer \xe2\x80\x99a yeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe corporal went away. The youth remained on the ground like a parcel.\r\nHe stared with a vacant look into the fire.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he aroused, for some part, and the things about him began\r\nto take form. He saw that the ground in the deep shadows was cluttered\r\nwith men, sprawling in every conceivable posture. Glancing narrowly\r\ninto the more distant darkness, he caught occasional glimpses of\r\nvisages that loomed pallid and ghostly, lit with a phosphorescent glow.\r\nThese faces expressed in their lines the deep stupor of the tired\r\nsoldiers. They made them appear like men drunk with wine. This bit of\r\nforest might have appeared to an ethereal wanderer as a scene of the\r\nresult of some frightful debauch.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the fire the youth observed an officer asleep,\r\nseated bolt upright, with his back against a tree. There was something\r\nperilous in his position. Badgered by dreams, perhaps, he swayed with\r\nlittle bounces and starts, like an old, toddy-stricken grandfather in a\r\nchimney corner. Dust and stains were upon his face. His lower jaw hung\r\ndown as if lacking strength to assume its normal position. He was the\r\npicture of an exhausted soldier after a feast of war.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently gone to sleep with his sword in his arms. These two\r\nhad slumbered in an embrace, but the weapon had been allowed in time to\r\nfall unheeded to the ground. The brass-mounted hilt lay in contact with\r\nsome parts of the fire.\r\n\r\nWithin the gleam of rose and orange light from the burning sticks were\r\nother soldiers, snoring and heaving, or lying deathlike in slumber. A\r\nfew pairs of legs were stuck forth, rigid and straight. The shoes\r\ndisplayed the mud or dust of marches and bits of rounded trousers,\r\nprotruding from the blankets, showed rents and tears from hurried\r\npitchings through the dense brambles.\r\n\r\nThe fire cackled musically. From it swelled light smoke. Overhead the\r\nfoliage moved softly. The leaves, with their faces turned toward the\r\nblaze, were colored shifting hues of silver, often edged with red. Far\r\noff to the right, through a window in the forest could be seen a\r\nhandful of stars lying, like glittering pebbles, on the black level of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in this low-arched hall, a soldier would arouse and turn\r\nhis body to a new position, the experience of his sleep having taught\r\nhim of uneven and objectionable places upon the ground under him. Or,\r\nperhaps, he would lift himself to a sitting posture, blink at the fire\r\nfor an unintelligent moment, throw a swift glance at his prostrate\r\ncompanion, and then cuddle down again with a grunt of sleepy content.\r\n\r\nThe youth sat in a forlorn heap until his friend the loud young soldier\r\ncame, swinging two canteens by their light strings. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, Henry,\r\nol\xe2\x80\x99 boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have yeh fixed up in jest about a\r\nminnit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had the bustling ways of an amateur nurse. He fussed around the fire\r\nand stirred the sticks to brilliant exertions. He made his patient\r\ndrink largely from the canteen that contained the coffee. It was to the\r\nyouth a delicious draught. He tilted his head afar back and held the\r\ncanteen long to his lips. The cool mixture went caressingly down his\r\nblistered throat. Having finished, he sighed with comfortable delight.\r\n\r\nThe loud young soldier watched his comrade with an air of satisfaction.\r\nHe later produced an extensive handkerchief from his pocket. He folded\r\nit into a manner of bandage and soused water from the other canteen\r\nupon the middle of it. This crude arrangement he bound over the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, tying the ends in a queer knot at the back of the neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving off and surveying his deed, \xe2\x80\x9cyeh look like th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndevil, but I bet yeh feel better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth contemplated his friend with grateful eyes. Upon his aching\r\nand swelling head the cold cloth was like a tender woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh don\xe2\x80\x99t holler ner say nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked his friend approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow I\xe2\x80\x99m a blacksmith at takin\xe2\x80\x99 keer \xe2\x80\x99a sick folks, an\xe2\x80\x99 yeh never\r\nsqueaked. Yer a good un, Henry. Most \xe2\x80\x99a men would a\xe2\x80\x99 been in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhospital long ago. A shot in th\xe2\x80\x99 head ain\xe2\x80\x99t foolin\xe2\x80\x99 business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth made no reply, but began to fumble with the buttons of his\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come, now,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his friend, \xe2\x80\x9ccome on. I must put yeh t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbed an\xe2\x80\x99 see that yeh git a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other got carefully erect, and the loud young soldier led him among\r\nthe sleeping forms lying in groups and rows. Presently he stooped and\r\npicked up his blankets. He spread the rubber one upon the ground and\r\nplaced the woolen one about the youth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clie down an\xe2\x80\x99 git some sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth, with his manner of doglike obedience, got carefully down\r\nlike a crone stooping. He stretched out with a murmur of relief and\r\ncomfort. The ground felt like the softest couch.\r\n\r\nBut of a sudden he ejaculated: \xe2\x80\x9cHol\xe2\x80\x99 on a minnit! Where you goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend waved his hand impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cRight down there by yeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but hol\xe2\x80\x99 on a minnit,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsleep in? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loud young soldier snarled: \xe2\x80\x9cShet up an\xe2\x80\x99 go on t\xe2\x80\x99 sleep. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 a damn\xe2\x80\x99 fool \xe2\x80\x99a yerself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said severely.\r\n\r\nAfter the reproof the youth said no more. An exquisite drowsiness had\r\nspread through him. The warm comfort of the blanket enveloped him and\r\nmade a gentle langour. His head fell forward on his crooked arm and his\r\nweighted lids went softly down over his eyes. Hearing a splatter of\r\nmusketry from the distance, he wondered indifferently if those men\r\nsometimes slept. He gave a long sigh, snuggled down into his blanket,\r\nand in a moment was like his comrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the youth awoke it seemed to him that he had been asleep for a\r\nthousand years, and he felt sure that he opened his eyes upon an\r\nunexpected world. Gray mists were slowly shifting before the first\r\nefforts of the sun rays. An impending splendor could be seen in the\r\neastern sky. An icy dew had chilled his face, and immediately upon\r\narousing he curled farther down into his blanket. He stared for a while\r\nat the leaves overhead, moving in a heraldic wind of the day.\r\n\r\nThe distance was splintering and blaring with the noise of fighting.\r\nThere was in the sound an expression of a deadly persistency, as if it\r\nhad not began and was not to cease.\r\n\r\nAbout him were the rows and groups of men that he had dimly seen the\r\nprevious night. They were getting a last draught of sleep before the\r\nawakening. The gaunt, careworn features and dusty figures were made\r\nplain by this quaint light at the dawning, but it dressed the skin of\r\nthe men in corpse-like hues and made the tangled limbs appear pulseless\r\nand dead. The youth started up with a little cry when his eyes first\r\nswept over this motionless mass of men, thick-spread upon the ground,\r\npallid, and in strange postures. His disordered mind interpreted the\r\nhall of the forest as a charnel place. He believed for an instant that\r\nhe was in the house of the dead, and he did not dare to move lest these\r\ncorpses start up, squalling and squawking. In a second, however, he\r\nachieved his proper mind. He swore a complicated oath at himself. He\r\nsaw that this somber picture was not a fact of the present, but a mere\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nHe heard then the noise of a fire crackling briskly in the cold air,\r\nand, turning his head, he saw his friend pottering busily about a small\r\nblaze. A few other figures moved in the fog, and he heard the hard\r\ncracking of axe blows.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a hollow rumble of drums. A distant bugle sang\r\nfaintly. Similar sounds, varying in strength, came from near and far\r\nover the forest. The bugles called to each other like brazen gamecocks.\r\nThe near thunder of the regimental drums rolled.\r\n\r\nThe body of men in the woods rustled. There was a general uplifting of\r\nheads. A murmuring of voices broke upon the air. In it there was much\r\nbass of grumbling oaths. Strange gods were addressed in condemnation of\r\nthe early hours necessary to correct war. An officer\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory tenor\r\nrang out and quickened the stiffened movement of the men. The tangled\r\nlimbs unraveled. The corpse-hued faces were hidden behind fists that\r\ntwisted slowly in the eye sockets.\r\n\r\nThe youth sat up and gave vent to an enormous yawn. \xe2\x80\x9cThunder!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nremarked petulantly. He rubbed his eyes, and then putting up his hand\r\nfelt carefully the bandage over his wound. His friend, perceiving him\r\nto be awake, came from the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Henry, ol\xe2\x80\x99 man, how do yeh feel\r\nthis mornin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe youth yawned again. Then he puckered his mouth to a little pucker.\r\nHis head, in truth, felt precisely like a melon, and there was an\r\nunpleasant sensation at his stomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord, I feel pretty bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThunder!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped ye\xe2\x80\x99d feel all right this\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see th\xe2\x80\x99 bandage\xe2\x80\x94I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s slipped.\xe2\x80\x9d He began to\r\ntinker at the wound in rather a clumsy way until the youth exploded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh-dern it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in sharp irritation; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the hangdest man I\r\never saw! You wear muffs on your hands. Why in good thunderation can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou be more easy? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you\xe2\x80\x99d stand off an\xe2\x80\x99 throw guns at it. Now,\r\ngo slow, an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t act as if you was nailing down carpet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glared with insolent command at his friend, but the latter answered\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, come now, an\xe2\x80\x99 git some grub,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\r\nmaybe, yeh\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the fireside the loud young soldier watched over his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s wants\r\nwith tenderness and care. He was very busy marshaling the little black\r\nvagabonds of tin cups and pouring into them the streaming iron colored\r\nmixture from a small and sooty tin pail. He had some fresh meat, which\r\nhe roasted hurriedly on a stick. He sat down then and contemplated the\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s appetite with glee.\r\n\r\nThe youth took note of a remarkable change in his comrade since those\r\ndays of camp life upon the river bank. He seemed no more to be\r\ncontinually regarding the proportions of his personal prowess. He was\r\nnot furious at small words that pricked his conceits. He was no more a\r\nloud young soldier. There was about him now a fine reliance. He showed\r\na quiet belief in his purposes and his abilities. And this inward\r\nconfidence evidently enabled him to be indifferent to little words of\r\nother men aimed at him.\r\n\r\nThe youth reflected. He had been used to regarding his comrade as a\r\nblatant child with an audacity grown from his inexperience,\r\nthoughtless, headstrong, jealous, and filled with a tinsel courage. A\r\nswaggering babe accustomed to strut in his own dooryard. The youth\r\nwondered where had been born these new eyes; when his comrade had made\r\nthe great discovery that there were many men who would refuse to be\r\nsubjected by him. Apparently, the other had now climbed a peak of\r\nwisdom from which he could perceive himself as a very wee thing. And\r\nthe youth saw that ever after it would be easier to live in his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis comrade balanced his ebony coffee-cup on his knee. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat d\xe2\x80\x99yeh think th\xe2\x80\x99 chances are? D\xe2\x80\x99yeh think we\xe2\x80\x99ll wallop\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth considered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cDay-b\xe2\x80\x99fore-yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he finally\r\nreplied, with boldness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 bet you\xe2\x80\x99d lick the hull\r\nkit-an\xe2\x80\x99-boodle all by yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend looked a trifle amazed. \xe2\x80\x9cWould I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He pondered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps I would,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided at last. He stared humbly at the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe youth was quite disconcerted at this surprising reception of his\r\nremarks. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t either,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hastily trying to\r\nretrace.\r\n\r\nBut the other made a deprecating gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeh needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I was a pretty big fool in those days.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nspoke as after a lapse of years.\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll th\xe2\x80\x99 officers say we\xe2\x80\x99ve got th\xe2\x80\x99 rebs in a pretty tight box,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe friend, clearing his throat in a commonplace way. \xe2\x80\x9cThey all seem t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthink we\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em jest where we want \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d the youth replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I seen over on th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nright makes me think it was th\xe2\x80\x99 other way about. From where I was, it\r\nlooked as if we was gettin\xe2\x80\x99 a good poundin\xe2\x80\x99 yestirday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99yeh think so?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we handled \xe2\x80\x99em pretty\r\nrough yestirday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, lord, man, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing of\r\nthe fight. Why!\xe2\x80\x9d Then a sudden thought came to him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Jim Conklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend started. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Is he? Jim Conklin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth spoke slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead. Shot in th\xe2\x80\x99 side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh don\xe2\x80\x99t say so. Jim Conklin. . .poor cuss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll about them were other small fires surrounded by men with their\r\nlittle black utensils. From one of these near came sudden sharp voices\r\nin a row. It appeared that two light-footed soldiers had been teasing a\r\nhuge, bearded man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue knees. The\r\nman had gone into a rage and had sworn comprehensively. Stung by his\r\nlanguage, his tormentors had immediately bristled at him with a great\r\nshow of resenting unjust oaths. Possibly there was going to be a fight.\r\n\r\nThe friend arose and went over to them, making pacific motions with his\r\narms. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, here, now, boys, what\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 use?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be at th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrebs in less\xe2\x80\x99n an hour. What\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 good fightin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99mong ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the light-footed soldiers turned upon him red-faced and violent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh needn\xe2\x80\x99t come around here with yer preachin\xe2\x80\x99. I s\xe2\x80\x99pose yeh don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\napprove \xe2\x80\x99a fightin\xe2\x80\x99 since Charley Morgan licked yeh; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhat business this here is \xe2\x80\x99a yours or anybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friend mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cStill I hate t\xe2\x80\x99 see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a tangled argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d said the two, indicating their opponent with accusative\r\nforefingers.\r\n\r\nThe huge soldier was quite purple with rage. He pointed at the two\r\nsoldiers with his great hand, extended clawlike. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut during this argumentative time the desire to deal blows seemed to\r\npass, although they said much to each other. Finally the friend\r\nreturned to his old seat. In a short while the three antagonists could\r\nbe seen together in an amiable bunch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJimmie Rogers ses I\xe2\x80\x99ll have t\xe2\x80\x99 fight him after th\xe2\x80\x99 battle t\xe2\x80\x99-day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nannounced the friend as he again seated himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ses he don\xe2\x80\x99t allow\r\nno interferin\xe2\x80\x99 in his business. I hate t\xe2\x80\x99 see th\xe2\x80\x99 boys fightin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99mong\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYer changed a good bit. Yeh ain\xe2\x80\x99t at all like yeh\r\nwas. I remember when you an\xe2\x80\x99 that Irish feller\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and laughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use t\xe2\x80\x99 be that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true \xe2\x80\x99nough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the youth.\r\n\r\nThe friend made another deprecatory gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeh needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nHenry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another little pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 reg\xe2\x80\x99ment lost over half th\xe2\x80\x99 men yestirday,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the friend\r\neventually. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought \xe2\x80\x99a course they was all dead, but, laws, they\r\nkep\xe2\x80\x99 a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 back last night until it seems, after all, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose\r\nbut a few. They\xe2\x80\x99d been scattered all over, wanderin\xe2\x80\x99 around in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwoods, fightin\xe2\x80\x99 with other reg\xe2\x80\x99ments, an\xe2\x80\x99 everything. Jest like you\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo?\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regiment was standing at order arms at the side of a lane, waiting\r\nfor the command to march, when suddenly the youth remembered the little\r\npacket enwrapped in a faded yellow envelope which the loud young\r\nsoldier with lugubrious words had intrusted to him. It made him start.\r\nHe uttered an exclamation and turned toward his comrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend, at his side in the ranks, was thoughtfully staring down the\r\nroad. From some cause his expression was at that moment very meek. The\r\nyouth, regarding him with sidelong glances, felt impelled to change his\r\npurpose. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHis friend turned his head in some surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what was yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the youth.\r\n\r\nHe resolved not to deal the little blow. It was sufficient that the\r\nfact made him glad. It was not necessary to knock his friend on the\r\nhead with the misguided packet.\r\n\r\nHe had been possessed of much fear of his friend, for he saw how easily\r\nquestionings could make holes in his feelings. Lately, he had assured\r\nhimself that the altered comrade would not tantalize him with a\r\npersistent curiosity, but he felt certain that during the first period\r\nof leisure his friend would ask him to relate his adventures of the\r\nprevious day.\r\n\r\nHe now rejoiced in the possession of a small weapon with which he could\r\nprostrate his comrade at the first signs of a cross-examination. He was\r\nmaster. It would now be he who could laugh and shoot the shafts of\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nThe friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with sobs of his own death. He\r\nhad delivered a melancholy oration previous to his funeral, and had\r\ndoubtless in the packet of letters, presented various keepsakes to\r\nrelatives. But he had not died, and thus he had delivered himself into\r\nthe hands of the youth.\r\n\r\nThe latter felt immensely superior to his friend, but he inclined to\r\ncondescension. He adopted toward him an air of patronizing good humor.\r\n\r\nHis self-pride was now entirely restored. In the shade of its\r\nflourishing growth he stood with braced and self-confident legs, and\r\nsince nothing could now be discovered he did not shrink from an\r\nencounter with the eyes of judges, and allowed no thoughts of his own\r\nto keep him from an attitude of manfulness. He had performed his\r\nmistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when he remembered his fortunes of yesterday, and looked at\r\nthem from a distance he began to see something fine there. He had\r\nlicense to be pompous and veteranlike.\r\n\r\nHis panting agonies of the past he put out of his sight.\r\n\r\nIn the present, he declared to himself that it was only the doomed and\r\nthe damned who roared with sincerity at circumstance. Few but they ever\r\ndid it. A man with a full stomach and the respect of his fellows had no\r\nbusiness to scold about anything that he might think to be wrong in the\r\nways of the universe, or even with the ways of society. Let the\r\nunfortunates rail; the others may play marbles.\r\n\r\nHe did not give a great deal of thought to these battles that lay\r\ndirectly before him. It was not essential that he should plan his ways\r\nin regard to them. He had been taught that many obligations of a life\r\nwere easily avoided. The lessons of yesterday had been that retribution\r\nwas a laggard and blind. With these facts before him he did not deem it\r\nnecessary that he should become feverish over the possibilities of the\r\nensuing twenty-four hours. He could leave much to chance. Besides, a\r\nfaith in himself had secretly blossomed. There was a little flower of\r\nconfidence growing within him. He was now a man of experience. He had\r\nbeen out among the dragons, he said, and he assured himself that they\r\nwere not so hideous as he had imagined them. Also, they were\r\ninaccurate; they did not sting with precision. A stout heart often\r\ndefied, and defying, escaped.\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, how could they kill him who was the chosen of gods\r\nand doomed to greatness?\r\n\r\nHe remembered how some of the men had run from the battle. As he\r\nrecalled their terror-struck faces he felt a scorn for them. They had\r\nsurely been more fleet and more wild than was absolutely necessary.\r\nThey were weak mortals. As for himself, he had fled with discretion and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from this reverie by his friend, who, having hitched\r\nabout nervously and blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed\r\nin an introductory way, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFleming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend put his hand up to his mouth and coughed again. He fidgeted\r\nin his jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he gulped at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess yeh might as well give me back them\r\nletters.\xe2\x80\x9d Dark, prickling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth. He loosened two buttons of his\r\ncoat, thrust in his hand, and brought forth the packet. As he extended\r\nit to his friend the latter\xe2\x80\x99s face was turned from him.\r\n\r\nHe had been slow in the act of producing the packet because during it\r\nhe had been trying to invent a remarkable comment on the affair. He\r\ncould conjure up nothing of sufficient point. He was compelled to allow\r\nhis friend to escape unmolested with his packet. And for this he took\r\nunto himself considerable credit. It was a generous thing.\r\n\r\nHis friend at his side seemed suffering great shame. As he contemplated\r\nhim, the youth felt his heart grow more strong and stout. He had never\r\nbeen compelled to blush in such manner for his acts; he was an\r\nindividual of extraordinary virtues.\r\n\r\nHe reflected, with condescending pity: \xe2\x80\x9cToo bad! Too bad! The poor\r\ndevil, it makes him feel tough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this incident, and as he reviewed the battle pictures he had\r\nseen, he felt quite competent to return home and make the hearts of the\r\npeople glow with stories of war. He could see himself in a room of warm\r\ntints telling tales to listeners. He could exhibit laurels. They were\r\ninsignificant; still, in a district where laurels were infrequent, they\r\nmight shine.\r\n\r\nHe saw his gaping audience picturing him as the central figure in\r\nblazing scenes. And he imagined the consternation and the ejaculations\r\nof his mother and the young lady at the seminary as they drank his\r\nrecitals. Their vague feminine formula for beloved ones doing brave\r\ndeeds on the field of battle without risk of life would be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sputtering of musketry was always to be heard. Later, the cannon had\r\nentered the dispute. In the fog-filled air their voices made a thudding\r\nsound. The reverberations were continual. This part of the world led a\r\nstrange, battleful existence.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain\r\nlong in some damp trenches. The men took positions behind a curving\r\nline of rifle pits that had been turned up, like a large furrow, along\r\nthe line of woods. Before them was a level stretch, peopled with short,\r\ndeformed stumps. From the woods beyond came the dull popping of the\r\nskirmishers and pickets, firing in the fog. From the right came the\r\nnoise of a terrific fracas.\r\n\r\nThe men cuddled behind the small embankment and sat in easy attitudes\r\nawaiting their turn. Many had their backs to the firing. The youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend lay down, buried his face in his arms, and almost instantly, it\r\nseemed, he was in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nThe youth leaned his breast against the brown dirt and peered over at\r\nthe woods and up and down the line. Curtains of trees interfered with\r\nhis ways of vision. He could see the low line of trenches but for a\r\nshort distance. A few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills. Behind\r\nthem were rows of dark bodies with a few heads sticking curiously over\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nAlways the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and\r\nleft, and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions. The\r\nguns were roaring without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s pause for breath. It seemed that\r\nthe cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous\r\nwrangle. It became impossible to make a sentence heard.\r\n\r\nThe youth wished to launch a joke\xe2\x80\x94a quotation from newspapers. He\r\ndesired to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll quiet on the Rappahannock,\xe2\x80\x9d but the guns refused\r\nto permit even a comment upon their uproar. He never successfully\r\nconcluded the sentence. But at last the guns stopped, and among the men\r\nin the rifle pits rumors again flew, like birds, but they were now for\r\nthe most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to\r\nthe ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope. The men\xe2\x80\x99s faces\r\ngrew doleful from the interpreting of omens. Tales of hesitation and\r\nuncertainty on the part of those high in place and responsibility came\r\nto their ears. Stories of disaster were borne into their minds with\r\nmany proofs. This din of musketry on the right, growing like a released\r\ngenie of sound, expressed and emphasized the army\xe2\x80\x99s plight.\r\n\r\nThe men were disheartened and began to mutter. They made gestures\r\nexpressive of the sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what more can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d And it could\r\nalways be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could\r\nnot fully comprehend a defeat.\r\n\r\nBefore the gray mists had been totally obliterated by the sun rays, the\r\nregiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully\r\nthrough the woods. The disordered, hurrying lines of the enemy could\r\nsometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields. They were\r\nyelling, shrill and exultant.\r\n\r\nAt this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly\r\nenraged. He exploded in loud sentences. \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99jiminey, we\xe2\x80\x99re generaled by\r\na lot \xe2\x80\x99a lunkheads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than one feller has said that t\xe2\x80\x99-day,\xe2\x80\x9d observed a man.\r\n\r\nHis friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy. He looked behind\r\nhim until his mind took in the meaning of the movement. Then he sighed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose we got licked,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked sadly.\r\n\r\nThe youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely\r\ncondemn other men. He made an attempt to restrain himself, but the\r\nwords upon his tongue were too bitter. He presently began a long and\r\nintricate denunciation of the commander of the forces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe, it wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t all his fault\xe2\x80\x94not all together. He did th\xe2\x80\x99 best he\r\nknowed. It\xe2\x80\x99s our luck t\xe2\x80\x99 git licked often,\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend in a weary\r\ntone. He was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes\r\nlike a man who has been caned and kicked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t we fight like the devil? Don\xe2\x80\x99t we do all that men can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the youth loudly.\r\n\r\nHe was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment when it came from his\r\nlips. For a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about\r\nhim. But no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and\r\npresently he recovered his air of courage. He went on to repeat a\r\nstatement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that\r\nmorning. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brigadier said he never saw a new reg\xe2\x80\x99ment fight the way\r\nwe fought yestirday, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do better than many\r\nanother reg\xe2\x80\x99ment, did we? Well, then, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 army\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfault, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his reply, the friend\xe2\x80\x99s voice was stern. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99A course not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man dare say we don\xe2\x80\x99t fight like th\xe2\x80\x99 devil. No man will ever dare\r\nsay it. Th\xe2\x80\x99 boys fight like hell-roosters. But still\xe2\x80\x94still, we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave no luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if we fight like the devil an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t ever whip, it must be\r\nthe general\xe2\x80\x99s fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth grandly and decisively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting, yet always\r\nlosing through some derned old lunkhead of a general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sarcastic man who was tramping at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s side, then spoke\r\nlazily. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe yeh think yeh fit th\xe2\x80\x99 hull battle yestirday, Fleming,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe remarked.\r\n\r\nThe speech pierced the youth. Inwardly he was reduced to an abject pulp\r\nby these chance words. His legs quaked privately. He cast a frightened\r\nglance at the sarcastic man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to say in a conciliating voice \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\nfought the whole battle yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning. Apparently, he had\r\nno information. It was merely his habit. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in the same\r\ntone of calm derision.\r\n\r\nThe youth, nevertheless, felt a threat. His mind shrank from going near\r\nto the danger, and thereafter he was silent. The significance of the\r\nsarcastic man\xe2\x80\x99s words took from him all loud moods that would make him\r\nappear prominent. He became suddenly a modest person.\r\n\r\nThere was low-toned talk among the troops. The officers were impatient\r\nand snappy, their countenances clouded with the tales of misfortune.\r\nThe troops, sifting through the forest, were sullen. In the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany once a man\xe2\x80\x99s laugh rang out. A dozen soldiers turned their\r\nfaces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe noise of firing dogged their footsteps. Sometimes, it seemed to be\r\ndriven a little way, but it always returned again with increased\r\ninsolence. The men muttered and cursed, throwing black looks in its\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn a clear space the troops were at last halted. Regiments and\r\nbrigades, broken and detached through their encounters with thickets,\r\ngrew together again and lines were faced toward the pursuing bark of\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s infantry.\r\n\r\nThis noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds,\r\nincreased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went\r\nserenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy\r\nthickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings. The woods began to\r\ncrackle as if afire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoop-a-dadee,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are! Everybody fightin\xe2\x80\x99. Blood\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was willin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 bet they\xe2\x80\x99d attack as soon as th\xe2\x80\x99 sun got fairly up,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsavagely asserted the lieutenant who commanded the youth\xe2\x80\x99s company. He\r\njerked without mercy at his little mustache. He strode to and fro with\r\ndark dignity in the rear of his men, who were lying down behind\r\nwhatever protection they had collected.\r\n\r\nA battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully\r\nshelling the distance. The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the\r\nmoment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed\r\nby the lines of flame. There was much growling and swearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Gawd,\xe2\x80\x9d the youth grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re always being chased around like\r\nrats! It makes me sick. Nobody seems to know where we go or why we go.\r\nWe just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and\r\nget licked there, and nobody knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s done for. It makes a man\r\nfeel like a damn\xe2\x80\x99 kitten in a bag. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what the\r\neternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow, unless it\r\nwas to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us. We came in here and got\r\nour legs all tangled up in these cussed briers, and then we begin to\r\nfight and the rebs had an easy time of it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nluck! I know better. It\xe2\x80\x99s this derned old\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of\r\ncalm confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out all right in th\xe2\x80\x99 end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the devil it will! You always talk like a dog-hanged parson. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me! I know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this time there was an interposition by the savage-minded\r\nlieutenant, who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction\r\nupon his men. \xe2\x80\x9cYou boys shut right up! There no need \xe2\x80\x99a your wastin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour breath in long-winded arguments about this an\xe2\x80\x99 that an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 other.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been jawin\xe2\x80\x99 like a lot \xe2\x80\x99a old hens. All you\xe2\x80\x99ve got t\xe2\x80\x99 do is to\r\nfight, an\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ll get plenty \xe2\x80\x99a that t\xe2\x80\x99 do in about ten minutes. Less\r\ntalkin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 more fightin\xe2\x80\x99 is what\xe2\x80\x99s best for you boys. I never saw sech\r\ngabbling jackasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to\r\nreply. No words being said, he resumed his dignified pacing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s too much chin music an\xe2\x80\x99 too little fightin\xe2\x80\x99 in this war,\r\nanyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to them, turning his head for a final remark.\r\n\r\nThe day had grown more white, until the sun shed his full radiance upon\r\nthe thronged forest. A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward\r\nthat part of the line where lay the youth\xe2\x80\x99s regiment. The front shifted\r\na trifle to meet it squarely. There was a wait. In this part of the\r\nfield there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the tempest.\r\n\r\nA single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment. In an instant\r\nit was joined by many others. There was a mighty song of clashes and\r\ncrashes that went sweeping through the woods. The guns in the rear,\r\naroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burr-like at them,\r\nsuddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band\r\nof guns. The battle roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a\r\nsingle, long explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the\r\nattitudes of the men. They were worn, exhausted, having slept but\r\nlittle and labored much. They rolled their eyes toward the advancing\r\nbattle as they stood awaiting the shock. Some shrank and flinched. They\r\nstood as men tied to stakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advance of the enemy had seemed to the youth like a ruthless\r\nhunting. He began to fume with rage and exasperation. He beat his foot\r\nupon the ground, and scowled with hate at the swirling smoke that was\r\napproaching like a phantom flood. There was a maddening quality in this\r\nseeming resolution of the foe to give him no rest, to give him no time\r\nto sit down and think. Yesterday he had fought and had fled rapidly.\r\nThere had been many adventures. For to-day he felt that he had earned\r\nopportunities for contemplative repose. He could have enjoyed\r\nportraying to uninitiated listeners various scenes at which he had been\r\na witness or ably discussing the processes of war with other proved\r\nmen. Too it was important that he should have time for physical\r\nrecuperation. He was sore and stiff from his experiences. He had\r\nreceived his fill of all exertions, and he wished to rest.\r\n\r\nBut those other men seemed never to grow weary; they were fighting with\r\ntheir old speed. He had a wild hate for the relentless foe. Yesterday,\r\nwhen he had imagined the universe to be against him, he had hated it,\r\nlittle gods and big gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with the\r\nsame great hatred. He was not going to be badgered of his life, like a\r\nkitten chased by boys, he said. It was not well to drive men into final\r\ncorners; at those moments they could all develop teeth and claws.\r\n\r\nHe leaned and spoke into his friend\xe2\x80\x99s ear. He menaced the woods with a\r\ngesture. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they keep on chasing us, by Gawd, they\xe2\x80\x99d better watch out.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t stand _too_ much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend twisted his head and made a calm reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they keep on\r\na-chasin\xe2\x80\x99 us they\xe2\x80\x99ll drive us all inteh th\xe2\x80\x99 river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth cried out savagely at this statement. He crouched behind a\r\nlittle tree, with his eyes burning hatefully and his teeth set in a\r\ncurlike snarl. The awkward bandage was still about his head, and upon\r\nit, over his wound, there was a spot of dry blood. His hair was\r\nwondrously tousled, and some straggling, moving locks hung over the\r\ncloth of the bandage down toward his forehead. His jacket and shirt\r\nwere open at the throat, and exposed his young bronzed neck. There\r\ncould be seen spasmodic gulpings at his throat.\r\n\r\nHis fingers twined nervously about his rifle. He wished that it was an\r\nengine of annihilating power. He felt that he and his companions were\r\nbeing taunted and derided from sincere convictions that they were poor\r\nand puny. His knowledge of his inability to take vengeance for it made\r\nhis rage into a dark and stormy specter, that possessed him and made\r\nhim dream of abominable cruelties. The tormentors were flies sucking\r\ninsolently at his blood, and he thought that he would have given his\r\nlife for a revenge of seeing their faces in pitiful plights.\r\n\r\nThe winds of battle had swept all about the regiment, until the one\r\nrifle, instantly followed by others, flashed in its front. A moment\r\nlater the regiment roared forth its sudden and valiant retort. A dense\r\nwall of smoke settled down. It was furiously slit and slashed by the\r\nknifelike fire from the rifles.\r\n\r\nTo the youth the fighters resembled animals tossed for a death struggle\r\ninto a dark pit. There was a sensation that he and his fellows, at bay,\r\nwere pushing back, always pushing fierce onslaughts of creatures who\r\nwere slippery. Their beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon\r\nthe bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade them with ease,\r\nand come through, between, around, and about with unopposed skill.\r\n\r\nWhen, in a dream, it occurred to the youth that his rifle was an\r\nimpotent stick, he lost sense of everything but his hate, his desire to\r\nsmash into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he could feel\r\nupon the faces of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe blue smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake stepped\r\nupon. It swung its ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.\r\n\r\nThe youth was not conscious that he was erect upon his feet. He did not\r\nknow the direction of the ground. Indeed, once he even lost the habit\r\nof balance and fell heavily. He was up again immediately. One thought\r\nwent through the chaos of his brain at the time. He wondered if he had\r\nfallen because he had been shot. But the suspicion flew away at once.\r\nHe did not think more of it.\r\n\r\nHe had taken up a first position behind the little tree, with a direct\r\ndetermination to hold it against the world. He had not deemed it\r\npossible that his army could that day succeed, and from this he felt\r\nthe ability to fight harder. But the throng had surged in all ways,\r\nuntil he lost directions and locations, save that he knew where lay the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe flames bit him, and the hot smoke broiled his skin. His rifle\r\nbarrel grew so hot that ordinarily he could not have borne it upon his\r\npalms; but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it, and pounding them\r\nwith his clanking, bending ramrod. If he aimed at some changing form\r\nthrough the smoke, he pulled the trigger with a fierce grunt, as if he\r\nwere dealing a blow of the fist with all his strength.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy seemed falling back before him and his fellows, he went\r\ninstantly forward, like a dog who, seeing his foes lagging, turns and\r\ninsists upon being pursued. And when he was compelled to retire again,\r\nhe did it slowly, sullenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.\r\n\r\nOnce he, in his intent hate, was almost alone, and was firing, when all\r\nthose near him had ceased. He was so engrossed in his occupation that\r\nhe was not aware of a lull.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled by a hoarse laugh and a sentence that came to his ears\r\nin a voice of contempt and amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cYeh infernal fool, don\xe2\x80\x99t yeh\r\nknow enough t\xe2\x80\x99 quit when there ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything t\xe2\x80\x99 shoot at? Good Gawd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned then and, pausing with his rifle thrown half into position,\r\nlooked at the blue line of his comrades. During this moment of leisure\r\nthey seemed all to be engaged in staring with astonishment at him. They\r\nhad become spectators. Turning to the front again he saw, under the\r\nlifted smoke, a deserted ground.\r\n\r\nHe looked bewildered for a moment. Then there appeared upon the glazed\r\nvacancy of his eyes a diamond point of intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ncomprehending.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his comrades and threw himself upon the ground. He\r\nsprawled like a man who had been thrashed. His flesh seemed strangely\r\non fire, and the sounds of the battle continued in his ears. He groped\r\nblindly for his canteen.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant was crowing. He seemed drunk with fighting. He called\r\nout to the youth: \xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens, if I had ten thousand wild cats like you\r\nI could tear th\xe2\x80\x99 stomach outa this war in less\xe2\x80\x99n a week!\xe2\x80\x9d He puffed out\r\nhis chest with large dignity as he said it.\r\n\r\nSome of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awestruck ways. It\r\nwas plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without\r\nproper intermission, they had found time to regard him. And they now\r\nlooked upon him as a war devil.\r\n\r\nThe friend came staggering to him. There was some fright and dismay in\r\nhis voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAre yeh all right, Fleming? Do yeh feel all right? There\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 matter with yeh, Henry, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth with difficulty. His throat seemed full of knobs\r\nand burrs.\r\n\r\nThese incidents made the youth ponder. It was revealed to him that he\r\nhad been a barbarian, a beast. He had fought like a pagan who defends\r\nhis religion. Regarding it, he saw that it was fine, wild, and, in some\r\nways, easy. He had been a tremendous figure, no doubt. By this struggle\r\nhe had overcome obstacles which he had admitted to be mountains. They\r\nhad fallen like paper peaks, and he was now what he called a hero. And\r\nhe had not been aware of the process. He had slept, and, awakening,\r\nfound himself a knight.\r\n\r\nHe lay and basked in the occasional stares of his comrades. Their faces\r\nwere varied in degrees of blackness from the burned powder. Some were\r\nutterly smudged. They were reeking with perspiration, and their breaths\r\ncame hard and wheezing. And from these soiled expanses they peered at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHot work! Hot work!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lieutenant deliriously. He walked up\r\nand down, restless and eager. Sometimes his voice could be heard in a\r\nwild, incomprehensible laugh.\r\n\r\nWhen he had a particularly profound thought upon the science of war he\r\nalways unconsciously addressed himself to the youth.\r\n\r\nThere was some grim rejoicing by the men. \xe2\x80\x9cBy thunder, I bet this\r\narmy\xe2\x80\x99ll never see another new reg\xe2\x80\x99ment like us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog, a woman, an\xe2\x80\x99 a walnut tree\r\nTh\xe2\x80\x99 more yeh beat \xe2\x80\x99em, th\xe2\x80\x99 better they be!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s like us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost a piler men, they did. If an ol\xe2\x80\x99 woman swep\xe2\x80\x99 up th\xe2\x80\x99 woods she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngit a dustpanful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, an\xe2\x80\x99 if she\xe2\x80\x99ll come around ag\xe2\x80\x99in in \xe2\x80\x99bout an hour she\xe2\x80\x99ll get a\r\npile more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe forest still bore its burden of clamor. From off under the trees\r\ncame the rolling clatter of the musketry. Each distant thicket seemed a\r\nstrange porcupine with quills of flame. A cloud of dark smoke, as from\r\nsmoldering ruins, went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the\r\nblue, enameled sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ragged line had respite for some minutes, but during its pause the\r\nstruggle in the forest became magnified until the trees seemed to\r\nquiver from the firing and the ground to shake from the rushing of men.\r\nThe voices of the cannon were mingled in a long and interminable row.\r\nIt seemed difficult to live in such an atmosphere. The chests of the\r\nmen strained for a bit of freshness, and their throats craved water.\r\n\r\nThere was one shot through the body, who raised a cry of bitter\r\nlamentation when came this lull. Perhaps he had been calling out during\r\nthe fighting also, but at that time no one had heard him. But now the\r\nmen turned at the woeful complaints of him upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? Who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts Jimmie Rogers. Jimmie Rogers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen their eyes first encountered him there was a sudden halt, as if\r\nthey feared to go near. He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting\r\nhis shuddering body into many strange postures. He was screaming\r\nloudly. This instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation seemed to fill him with a tremendous,\r\nfantastic contempt, and he damned them in shrieked sentences.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s friend had a geographical illusion concerning a stream, and\r\nhe obtained permission to go for some water. Immediately canteens were\r\nshowered upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cFill mine, will yeh?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBring me some, too.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nme, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He departed, ladened. The youth went with his friend, feeling\r\na desire to throw his heated body into the stream and, soaking there,\r\ndrink quarts.\r\n\r\nThey made a hurried search for the supposed stream, but did not find\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cNo water here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth. They turned without delay and\r\nbegan to retrace their steps.\r\n\r\nFrom their position as they again faced toward the place of the\r\nfighting, they could comprehend a greater amount of the battle than\r\nwhen their visions had been blurred by the hurling smoke of the line.\r\nThey could see dark stretches winding along the land, and on one\r\ncleared space there was a row of guns making gray clouds, which were\r\nfilled with large flashes of orange-colored flame. Over some foliage\r\nthey could see the roof of a house. One window, glowing a deep murder\r\nred, shone squarely through the leaves. From the edifice a tall leaning\r\ntower of smoke went far into the sky.\r\n\r\nLooking over their own troops, they saw mixed masses slowly getting\r\ninto regular form. The sunlight made twinkling points of the bright\r\nsteel. To the rear there was a glimpse of a distant roadway as it\r\ncurved over a slope. It was crowded with retreating infantry. From all\r\nthe interwoven forest arose the smoke and bluster of the battle. The\r\nair was always occupied by a blaring.\r\n\r\nNear where they stood shells were flip-flapping and hooting. Occasional\r\nbullets buzzed in the air and spanged into tree trunks. Wounded men and\r\nother stragglers were slinking through the woods.\r\n\r\nLooking down an aisle of the grove, the youth and his companion saw a\r\njangling general and his staff almost ride upon a wounded man, who was\r\ncrawling on his hands and knees. The general reined strongly at his\r\ncharger\xe2\x80\x99s opened and foamy mouth and guided it with dexterous\r\nhorsemanship past the man. The latter scrambled in wild and torturing\r\nhaste. His strength evidently failed him as he reached a place of\r\nsafety. One of his arms suddenly weakened, and he fell, sliding over\r\nupon his back. He lay stretched out, breathing gently.\r\n\r\nA moment later the small, creaking cavalcade was directly in front of\r\nthe two soldiers. Another officer, riding with the skillful abandon of\r\na cowboy, galloped his horse to a position directly before the general.\r\nThe two unnoticed foot soldiers made a little show of going on, but\r\nthey lingered near in the desire to overhear the conversation. Perhaps,\r\nthey thought, some great inner historical things would be said.\r\n\r\nThe general, whom the boys knew as the commander of their division,\r\nlooked at the other officer and spoke coolly, as if he were criticising\r\nhis clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 enemy\xe2\x80\x99s formin\xe2\x80\x99 over there for another charge,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be directed against Whiterside, an\xe2\x80\x99 I fear they\xe2\x80\x99ll break\r\nthrough unless we work like thunder t\xe2\x80\x99 stop them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other swore at his restive horse, and then cleared his throat. He\r\nmade a gesture toward his cap. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be hell t\xe2\x80\x99 pay stoppin\xe2\x80\x99 them,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume so,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the general. Then he began to talk rapidly and\r\nin a lower tone. He frequently illustrated his words with a pointing\r\nfinger. The two infantrymen could hear nothing until finally he asked:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat troops can you spare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer who rode like a cowboy reflected for an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI had to order in th\xe2\x80\x99 12th to help th\xe2\x80\x99 76th, an\xe2\x80\x99 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally got any. But there\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 304th. They fight like a lot \xe2\x80\x99a mule\r\ndrivers. I can spare them best of any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth and his friend exchanged glances of astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe general spoke sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cGet \xe2\x80\x99em ready, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch\r\ndevelopments from here, an\xe2\x80\x99 send you word when t\xe2\x80\x99 start them. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhappen in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the other officer tossed his fingers toward his cap and wheeling his\r\nhorse, started away, the general called out to him in a sober voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe many of your mule drivers will get back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other shouted something in reply. He smiled.\r\n\r\nWith scared faces, the youth and his companion hurried back to the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThese happenings had occupied an incredibly short time, yet the youth\r\nfelt that in them he had been made aged. New eyes were given to him.\r\nAnd the most startling thing was to learn suddenly that he was very\r\ninsignificant. The officer spoke of the regiment as if he referred to a\r\nbroom. Some part of the woods needed sweeping, perhaps, and he merely\r\nindicated a broom in a tone properly indifferent to its fate. It was\r\nwar, no doubt, but it appeared strange.\r\n\r\nAs the two boys approached the line, the lieutenant perceived them and\r\nswelled with wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cFleming\xe2\x80\x94Wilson\xe2\x80\x94how long does it take yeh to git\r\nwater, anyhow\xe2\x80\x94where yeh been to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his oration ceased as he saw their eyes, which were large with\r\ngreat tales. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 charge\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 charge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s friend, hastening with his news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharge?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cCharge? Well, b\xe2\x80\x99Gawd! Now, this is real\r\nfightin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Over his soiled countenance there went a boastful smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharge? Well, b\xe2\x80\x99Gawd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little group of soldiers surrounded the two youths. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we, sure\r\n\xe2\x80\x99nough? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be derned! Charge? What fer? What at? Wilson, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlyin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to die,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth, pitching his tones to the key of angry\r\nremonstrance. \xe2\x80\x9cSure as shooting, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his friend spoke in re-enforcement. \xe2\x80\x9cNot by a blame sight, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlyin\xe2\x80\x99. We heard \xe2\x80\x99em talkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey caught sight of two mounted figures a short distance from them.\r\nOne was the colonel of the regiment and the other was the officer who\r\nhad received orders from the commander of the division. They were\r\ngesticulating at each other. The soldier, pointing at them, interpreted\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nOne man had a final objection: \xe2\x80\x9cHow could yeh hear \xe2\x80\x99em talkin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthe men, for a large part, nodded, admitting that previously the two\r\nfriends had spoken truth.\r\n\r\nThey settled back into reposeful attitudes with airs of having accepted\r\nthe matter. And they mused upon it, with a hundred varieties of\r\nexpression. It was an engrossing thing to think about. Many tightened\r\ntheir belts carefully and hitched at their trousers.\r\n\r\nA moment later the officers began to bustle among the men, pushing them\r\ninto a more compact mass and into a better alignment. They chased those\r\nthat straggled and fumed at a few men who seemed to show by their\r\nattitudes that they had decided to remain at that spot. They were like\r\ncritical shepherds, struggling with sheep.\r\n\r\nPresently, the regiment seemed to draw itself up and heave a deep\r\nbreath. None of the men\xe2\x80\x99s faces were mirrors of large thoughts. The\r\nsoldiers were bended and stooped like sprinters before a signal. Many\r\npairs of glinting eyes peered from the grimy faces toward the curtains\r\nof the deeper woods. They seemed to be engaged in deep calculations of\r\ntime and distance.\r\n\r\nThey were surrounded by the noises of the monstrous altercation between\r\nthe two armies. The world was fully interested in other matters.\r\nApparently, the regiment had its small affair to itself.\r\n\r\nThe youth, turning, shot a quick, inquiring glance at his friend. The\r\nlatter returned to him the same manner of look. They were the only ones\r\nwho possessed an inner knowledge. \xe2\x80\x9cMule drivers\xe2\x80\x94hell t\xe2\x80\x99 pay\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve many will get back.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an ironical secret. Still, they saw\r\nno hesitation in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces, and they nodded a mute and\r\nunprotesting assent when a shaggy man near them said in a meek voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll git swallowed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth stared at the land in front of him. Its foliages now seemed\r\nto veil powers and horrors. He was unaware of the machinery of orders\r\nthat started the charge, although from the corners of his eyes he saw\r\nan officer, who looked like a boy a-horseback, come galloping, waving\r\nhis hat. Suddenly he felt a straining and heaving among the men. The\r\nline fell slowly forward like a toppling wall, and, with a convulsive\r\ngasp that was intended for a cheer, the regiment began its journey. The\r\nyouth was pushed and jostled for a moment before he understood the\r\nmovement at all, but directly he lunged ahead and began to run.\r\n\r\nHe fixed his eye upon a distant and prominent clump of trees where he\r\nhad concluded the enemy were to be met, and he ran toward it as toward\r\na goal. He had believed throughout that it was a mere question of\r\ngetting over an unpleasant matter as quickly as possible, and he ran\r\ndesperately, as if pursued for a murder. His face was drawn hard and\r\ntight with the stress of his endeavor. His eyes were fixed in a lurid\r\nglare. And with his soiled and disordered dress, his red and inflamed\r\nfeatures surmounted by the dingy rag with its spot of blood, his wildly\r\nswinging rifle, and banging accouterments, he looked to be an insane\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nAs the regiment swung from its position out into a cleared space the\r\nwoods and thickets before it awakened. Yellow flames leaped toward it\r\nfrom many directions. The forest made a tremendous objection.\r\n\r\nThe line lurched straight for a moment. Then the right wing swung\r\nforward; it in turn was surpassed by the left. Afterward the center\r\ncareered to the front until the regiment was a wedge-shaped mass, but\r\nan instant later the opposition of the bushes, trees, and uneven places\r\non the ground split the command and scattered it into detached\r\nclusters.\r\n\r\nThe youth, light-footed, was unconsciously in advance. His eyes still\r\nkept note of the clump of trees. From all places near it the clannish\r\nyell of the enemy could be heard. The little flames of rifles leaped\r\nfrom it. The song of the bullets was in the air and shells snarled\r\namong the treetops. One tumbled directly into the middle of a hurrying\r\ngroup and exploded in crimson fury. There was an instant spectacle of a\r\nman, almost over it, throwing up his hands to shield his eyes.\r\n\r\nOther men, punched by bullets, fell in grotesque agonies. The regiment\r\nleft a coherent trail of bodies.\r\n\r\nThey had passed into a clearer atmosphere. There was an effect like a\r\nrevelation in the new appearance of the landscape. Some men working\r\nmadly at a battery were plain to them, and the opposing infantry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlines were defined by the gray walls and fringes of smoke.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the youth that he saw everything. Each blade of the green\r\ngrass was bold and clear. He thought that he was aware of every change\r\nin the thin, transparent vapor that floated idly in sheets. The brown\r\nor gray trunks of the trees showed each roughness of their surfaces.\r\nAnd the men of the regiment, with their starting eyes and sweating\r\nfaces, running madly, or falling, as if thrown headlong, to queer,\r\nheaped-up corpses\xe2\x80\x94all were comprehended. His mind took a mechanical but\r\nfirm impression, so that afterward everything was pictured and\r\nexplained to him, save why he himself was there.\r\n\r\nBut there was a frenzy made from this furious rush. The men, pitching\r\nforward insanely, had burst into cheerings, moblike and barbaric, but\r\ntuned in strange keys that can arouse the dullard and the stoic. It\r\nmade a mad enthusiasm that, it seemed, would be incapable of checking\r\nitself before granite and brass. There was the delirium that encounters\r\ndespair and death, and is heedless and blind to the odds. It is a\r\ntemporary but sublime absence of selfishness. And because it was of\r\nthis order was the reason, perhaps, why the youth wondered, afterward,\r\nwhat reasons he could have had for being there.\r\n\r\nPresently the straining pace ate up the energies of the men. As if by\r\nagreement, the leaders began to slacken their speed. The volleys\r\ndirected against them had had a seeming windlike effect. The regiment\r\nsnorted and blew. Among some stolid trees it began to falter and\r\nhesitate. The men, staring intently, began to wait for some of the\r\ndistant walls of smoke to move and disclose to them the scene. Since\r\nmuch of their strength and their breath had vanished, they returned to\r\ncaution. They were become men again.\r\n\r\nThe youth had a vague belief that he had run miles, and he thought, in\r\na way, that he was now in some new and unknown land.\r\n\r\nThe moment the regiment ceased its advance the protesting splutter of\r\nmusketry became a steadied roar. Long and accurate fringes of smoke\r\nspread out. From the top of a small hill came level belchings of yellow\r\nflame that caused an inhuman whistling in the air.\r\n\r\nThe men, halted, had opportunity to see some of their comrades dropping\r\nwith moans and shrieks. A few lay under foot, still or wailing. And now\r\nfor an instant the men stood, their rifles slack in their hands, and\r\nwatched the regiment dwindle. They appeared dazed and stupid. This\r\nspectacle seemed to paralyze them, overcome them with a fatal\r\nfascination. They stared woodenly at the sights, and, lowering their\r\neyes, looked from face to face. It was a strange pause, and a strange\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThen, above the sounds of the outside commotion, arose the roar of the\r\nlieutenant. He strode suddenly forth, his infantile features black with\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, yeh fools!\xe2\x80\x9d he bellowed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Yeh can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here. Yeh\r\nmust come on.\xe2\x80\x9d He said more, but much of it could not be understood.\r\n\r\nHe started rapidly forward, with his head turned toward the men, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d he was shouting. The men stared with blank and yokel-like eyes at\r\nhim. He was obliged to halt and retrace his steps. He stood then with\r\nhis back to the enemy and delivered gigantic curses into the faces of\r\nthe men. His body vibrated from the weight and force of his\r\nimprecations. And he could string oaths with the facility of a maiden\r\nwho strings beads.\r\n\r\nThe friend of the youth aroused. Lurching suddenly forward and dropping\r\nto his knees, he fired an angry shot at the persistent woods. This\r\naction awakened the men. They huddled no more like sheep. They seemed\r\nsuddenly to bethink themselves of their weapons, and at once commenced\r\nfiring. Belabored by their officers, they began to move forward. The\r\nregiment, involved like a cart involved in mud and muddle, started\r\nunevenly with many jolts and jerks. The men stopped now every few paces\r\nto fire and load, and in this manner moved slowly on from trees to\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe flaming opposition in their front grew with their advance until it\r\nseemed that all forward ways were barred by the thin leaping tongues,\r\nand off to the right an ominous demonstration could sometimes be dimly\r\ndiscerned. The smoke lately generated was in confusing clouds that made\r\nit difficult for the regiment to proceed with intelligence. As he\r\npassed through each curling mass the youth wondered what would confront\r\nhim on the farther side.\r\n\r\nThe command went painfully forward until an open space interposed\r\nbetween them and the lurid lines. Here, crouching and cowering behind\r\nsome trees, the men clung with desperation, as if threatened by a wave.\r\nThey looked wild-eyed, and as if amazed at this furious disturbance\r\nthey had stirred. In the storm there was an ironical expression of\r\ntheir importance. The faces of the men, too, showed a lack of a certain\r\nfeeling of responsibility for being there. It was as if they had been\r\ndriven. It was the dominant animal failing to remember in the supreme\r\nmoments the forceful causes of various superficial qualities. The whole\r\naffair seemed incomprehensible to many of them.\r\n\r\nAs they halted thus the lieutenant again began to bellow profanely.\r\nRegardless of the vindictive threats of the bullets, he went about\r\ncoaxing, berating, and bedamning. His lips, that were habitually in a\r\nsoft and childlike curve, were now writhed into unholy contortions. He\r\nswore by all possible deities.\r\n\r\nOnce he grabbed the youth by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, yeh lunkhead!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nroared. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on! We\xe2\x80\x99ll all git killed if we stay here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve on\xe2\x80\x99y got\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 go across that lot. An\xe2\x80\x99 then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the remainder of his idea disappeared\r\nin a blue haze of curses.\r\n\r\nThe youth stretched forth his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cCross there?\xe2\x80\x9d His mouth was\r\npuckered in doubt and awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Jest \xe2\x80\x99cross th\xe2\x80\x99 lot! We can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the\r\nlieutenant. He poked his face close to the youth and waved his bandaged\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d Presently he grappled with him as if for a wrestling\r\nbout. It was as if he planned to drag the youth by the ear on to the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nThe private felt a sudden unspeakable indignation against his officer.\r\nHe wrenched fiercely and shook him off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on yerself, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled. There was a bitter challenge in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThey galloped together down the regimental front. The friend scrambled\r\nafter them. In front of the colors the three men began to bawl: \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non! come on!\xe2\x80\x9d They danced and gyrated like tortured savages.\r\n\r\nThe flag, obedient to these appeals, bended its glittering form and\r\nswept toward them. The men wavered in indecision for a moment, and then\r\nwith a long, wailful cry the dilapidated regiment surged forward and\r\nbegan its new journey.\r\n\r\nOver the field went the scurrying mass. It was a handful of men\r\nsplattered into the faces of the enemy. Toward it instantly sprang the\r\nyellow tongues. A vast quantity of blue smoke hung before them. A\r\nmighty banging made ears valueless.\r\n\r\nThe youth ran like a madman to reach the woods before a bullet could\r\ndiscover him. He ducked his head low, like a football player. In his\r\nhaste his eyes almost closed, and the scene was a wild blur. Pulsating\r\nsaliva stood at the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\nWithin him, as he hurled himself forward, was born a love, a despairing\r\nfondness for this flag which was near him. It was a creation of beauty\r\nand invulnerability. It was a goddess, radiant, that bended its form\r\nwith an imperious gesture to him. It was a woman, red and white, hating\r\nand loving, that called him with the voice of his hopes. Because no\r\nharm could come to it he endowed it with power. He kept near, as if it\r\ncould be a saver of lives, and an imploring cry went from his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the mad scramble he was aware that the color sergeant flinched\r\nsuddenly, as if struck by a bludgeon. He faltered, and then became\r\nmotionless, save for his quivering knees. He made a spring and a clutch\r\nat the pole. At the same instant his friend grabbed it from the other\r\nside. They jerked at it, stout and furious, but the color sergeant was\r\ndead, and the corpse would not relinquish its trust. For a moment there\r\nwas a grim encounter. The dead man, swinging with bended back, seemed\r\nto be obstinately tugging, in ludicrous and awful ways, for the\r\npossession of the flag.\r\n\r\nIt was past in an instant of time. They wrenched the flag furiously\r\nfrom the dead man, and, as they turned again, the corpse swayed forward\r\nwith bowed head. One arm swung high, and the curved hand fell with\r\nheavy protest on the friend\xe2\x80\x99s unheeding shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the two youths turned with the flag they saw that much of the\r\nregiment had crumbled away, and the dejected remnant was coming slowly\r\nback. The men, having hurled themselves in projectile fashion, had\r\npresently expended their forces. They slowly retreated, with their\r\nfaces still toward the spluttering woods, and their hot rifles still\r\nreplying to the din. Several officers were giving orders, their voices\r\nkeyed to screams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere in hell yeh goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d the lieutenant was asking in a sarcastic\r\nhowl. And a red-bearded officer, whose voice of triple brass could\r\nplainly be heard, was commanding: \xe2\x80\x9cShoot into \xe2\x80\x99em! Shoot into \xe2\x80\x99em, Gawd\r\ndamn their souls!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a _mel\xc3\xa9e_ of screeches, in which the men\r\nwere ordered to do conflicting and impossible things.\r\n\r\nThe youth and his friend had a small scuffle over the flag. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, let me keep it!\xe2\x80\x9d Each felt satisfied with the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession of it, but each felt bound to declare, by an offer to carry\r\nthe emblem, his willingness to further risk himself. The youth roughly\r\npushed his friend away.\r\n\r\nThe regiment fell back to the stolid trees. There it halted for a\r\nmoment to blaze at some dark forms that had begun to steal upon its\r\ntrack. Presently it resumed its march again, curving among the tree\r\ntrunks. By the time the depleted regiment had again reached the first\r\nopen space they were receiving a fast and merciless fire. There seemed\r\nto be mobs all about them.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the men, discouraged, their spirits worn by the\r\nturmoil, acted as if stunned. They accepted the pelting of the bullets\r\nwith bowed and weary heads. It was of no purpose to strive against\r\nwalls. It was of no use to batter themselves against granite. And from\r\nthis consciousness that they had attempted to conquer an unconquerable\r\nthing there seemed to arise a feeling that they had been betrayed. They\r\nglowered with bent brows, but dangerously, upon some of the officers,\r\nmore particularly upon the red-bearded one with the voice of triple\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rear of the regiment was fringed with men, who continued\r\nto shoot irritably at the advancing foes. They seemed resolved to make\r\nevery trouble. The youthful lieutenant was perhaps the last man in the\r\ndisordered mass. His forgotten back was toward the enemy. He had been\r\nshot in the arm. It hung straight and rigid. Occasionally he would\r\ncease to remember it, and be about to emphasize an oath with a sweeping\r\ngesture. The multiplied pain caused him to swear with incredible power.\r\n\r\nThe youth went along with slipping uncertain feet. He kept watchful\r\neyes rearward. A scowl of mortification and rage was upon his face. He\r\nhad thought of a fine revenge upon the officer who had referred to him\r\nand his fellows as mule drivers. But he saw that it could not come to\r\npass. His dreams had collapsed when the mule drivers, dwindling\r\nrapidly, had wavered and hesitated on the little clearing, and then had\r\nrecoiled. And now the retreat of the mule drivers was a march of shame\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nA dagger-pointed gaze from without his blackened face was held toward\r\nthe enemy, but his greater hatred was riveted upon the man, who, not\r\nknowing him, had called him a mule driver.\r\n\r\nWhen he knew that he and his comrades had failed to do anything in\r\nsuccessful ways that might bring the little pangs of a kind of remorse\r\nupon the officer, the youth allowed the rage of the baffled to possess\r\nhim. This cold officer upon a monument, who dropped epithets\r\nunconcernedly down, would be finer as a dead man, he thought. So\r\ngrievous did he think it that he could never possess the secret right\r\nto taunt truly in answer.\r\n\r\nHe had pictured red letters of curious revenge. \xe2\x80\x9cWe _are_ mule drivers,\r\nare we?\xe2\x80\x9d And now he was compelled to throw them away.\r\n\r\nHe presently wrapped his heart in the cloak of his pride and kept the\r\nflag erect. He harangued his fellows, pushing against their chests with\r\nhis free hand. To those he knew well he made frantic appeals,\r\nbeseeching them by name. Between him and the lieutenant, scolding and\r\nnear to losing his mind with rage, there was felt a subtle fellowship\r\nand equality. They supported each other in all manner of hoarse,\r\nhowling protests.\r\n\r\nBut the regiment was a machine run down. The two men babbled at a\r\nforceless thing. The soldiers who had heart to go slowly were\r\ncontinually shaken in their resolves by a knowledge that comrades were\r\nslipping with speed back to the lines. It was difficult to think of\r\nreputation when others were thinking of skins. Wounded men were left\r\ncrying on this black journey.\r\n\r\nThe smoke fringes and flames blustered always. The youth, peering once\r\nthrough a sudden rift in a cloud, saw a brown mass of troops,\r\ninterwoven and magnified until they appeared to be thousands. A\r\nfierce-hued flag flashed before his vision.\r\n\r\nImmediately, as if the uplifting of the smoke had been prearranged, the\r\ndiscovered troops burst into a rasping yell, and a hundred flames\r\njetted toward the retreating band. A rolling gray cloud again\r\ninterposed as the regiment doggedly replied. The youth had to depend\r\nagain upon his misused ears, which were trembling and buzzing from the\r\n_mel\xc3\xa9e_ of musketry and yells.\r\n\r\nThe way seemed eternal. In the clouded haze men became panic-stricken\r\nwith the thought that the regiment had lost its path, and was\r\nproceeding in a perilous direction. Once the men who headed the wild\r\nprocession turned and came pushing back against their comrades,\r\nscreaming that they were being fired upon from points which they had\r\nconsidered to be toward their own lines. At this cry a hysterical fear\r\nand dismay beset the troops. A soldier, who heretofore had been\r\nambitious to make the regiment into a wise little band that would\r\nproceed calmly amid the huge-appearing difficulties, suddenly sank down\r\nand buried his face in his arms with an air of bowing to a doom. From\r\nanother a shrill lamentation rang out filled with profane allusions to\r\na general. Men ran hither and thither, seeking with their eyes roads of\r\nescape. With serene regularity, as if controlled by a schedule, bullets\r\nbuffed into men.\r\n\r\nThe youth walked stolidly into the midst of the mob, and with his flag\r\nin his hands took a stand as if he expected an attempt to push him to\r\nthe ground. He unconsciously assumed the attitude of the color bearer\r\nin the fight of the preceding day. He passed over his brow a hand that\r\ntrembled. His breath did not come freely. He was choking during this\r\nsmall wait for the crisis.\r\n\r\nHis friend came to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Henry, I guess this is good-by-John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up, you damned fool!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the youth, and he would not\r\nlook at the other.\r\n\r\nThe officers labored like politicians to beat the mass into a proper\r\ncircle to face the menaces. The ground was uneven and torn. The men\r\ncurled into depressions and fitted themselves snugly behind whatever\r\nwould frustrate a bullet. The youth noted with vague surprise that the\r\nlieutenant was standing mutely with his legs far apart and his sword\r\nheld in the manner of a cane. The youth wondered what had happened to\r\nhis vocal organs that he no more cursed.\r\n\r\nThere was something curious in this little intent pause of the\r\nlieutenant. He was like a babe which, having wept its fill, raises its\r\neyes and fixes upon a distant toy. He was engrossed in this\r\ncontemplation, and the soft under lip quivered from self-whispered\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nSome lazy and ignorant smoke curled slowly. The men, hiding from the\r\nbullets, waited anxiously for it to lift and disclose the plight of the\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nThe silent ranks were suddenly thrilled by the eager voice of the\r\nyouthful lieutenant bawling out: \xe2\x80\x9cHere they come! Right onto us,\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99Gawd!\xe2\x80\x9d His further words were lost in a roar of wicked thunder from\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x99s rifles.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had instantly turned in the direction indicated by the\r\nawakened and agitated lieutenant, and he had seen the haze of treachery\r\ndisclosing a body of soldiers of the enemy. They were so near that he\r\ncould see their features. There was a recognition as he looked at the\r\ntypes of faces. Also he perceived with dim amazement that their\r\nuniforms were rather gay in effect, being light gray, accented with a\r\nbrilliant-hued facing. Too, the clothes seemed new.\r\n\r\nThese troops had apparently been going forward with caution, their\r\nrifles held in readiness, when the youthful lieutenant had discovered\r\nthem and their movement had been interrupted by the volley from the\r\nblue regiment. From the moment\xe2\x80\x99s glimpse, it was derived that they had\r\nbeen unaware of the proximity of their dark-suited foes or had mistaken\r\nthe direction. Almost instantly they were shut utterly from the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsight by the smoke from the energetic rifles of his companions. He\r\nstrained his vision to learn the accomplishment of the volley, but the\r\nsmoke hung before him.\r\n\r\nThe two bodies of troops exchanged blows in the manner of a pair of\r\nboxers. The fast angry firings went back and forth. The men in blue\r\nwere intent with the despair of their circumstances and they seized\r\nupon the revenge to be had at close range. Their thunder swelled loud\r\nand valiant. Their curving front bristled with flashes and the place\r\nresounded with the clangor of their ramrods. The youth ducked and\r\ndodged for a time and achieved a few unsatisfactory views of the enemy.\r\nThere appeared to be many of them and they were replying swiftly. They\r\nseemed moving toward the blue regiment, step by step. He seated himself\r\ngloomily on the ground with his flag between his knees.\r\n\r\nAs he noted the vicious, wolflike temper of his comrades he had a sweet\r\nthought that if the enemy was about to swallow the regimental broom as\r\na large prisoner, it could at least have the consolation of going down\r\nwith bristles forward.\r\n\r\nBut the blows of the antagonist began to grow more weak. Fewer bullets\r\nripped the air, and finally, when the men slackened to learn of the\r\nfight, they could see only dark, floating smoke. The regiment lay still\r\nand gazed. Presently some chance whim came to the pestering blur, and\r\nit began to coil heavily away. The men saw a ground vacant of fighters.\r\nIt would have been an empty stage if it were not for a few corpses that\r\nlay thrown and twisted into fantastic shapes upon the sward.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this tableau, many of the men in blue sprang from behind\r\ntheir covers and made an ungainly dance of joy. Their eyes burned and a\r\nhoarse cheer of elation broke from their dry lips.\r\n\r\nIt had begun to seem to them that events were trying to prove that they\r\nwere impotent. These little battles had evidently endeavored to\r\ndemonstrate that the men could not fight well. When on the verge of\r\nsubmission to these opinions, the small duel had showed them that the\r\nproportions were not impossible, and by it they had revenged themselves\r\nupon their misgivings and upon the foe.\r\n\r\nThe impetus of enthusiasm was theirs again. They gazed about them with\r\nlooks of uplifted pride, feeling new trust in the grim, always\r\nconfident weapons in their hands. And they were men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently they knew that no firing threatened them. All ways seemed\r\nonce more opened to them. The dusty blue lines of their friends were\r\ndisclosed a short distance away. In the distance there were many\r\ncolossal noises, but in all this part of the field there was a sudden\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nThey perceived that they were free. The depleted band drew a long\r\nbreath of relief and gathered itself into a bunch to complete its trip.\r\n\r\nIn this last length of journey the men began to show strange emotions.\r\nThey hurried with nervous fear. Some who had been dark and unfaltering\r\nin the grimmest moments now could not conceal an anxiety that made them\r\nfrantic. It was perhaps that they dreaded to be killed in insignificant\r\nways after the times for proper military deaths had passed. Or,\r\nperhaps, they thought it would be too ironical to get killed at the\r\nportals of safety. With backward looks of perturbation, they hastened.\r\n\r\nAs they approached their own lines there was some sarcasm exhibited on\r\nthe part of a gaunt and bronzed regiment that lay resting in the shade\r\nof the trees. Questions were wafted to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere th\xe2\x80\x99 hell yeh been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat yeh comin\xe2\x80\x99 back fer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t yeh stay there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it warm out there, sonny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoin\xe2\x80\x99 home now, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne shouted in taunting mimicry: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother, come quick an\xe2\x80\x99 look at\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 sojers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no reply from the bruised and battered regiment, save that\r\none man made broadcast challenges to fist fights and the red-bearded\r\nofficer walked rather near and glared in great swashbuckler style at a\r\ntall captain in the other regiment. But the lieutenant suppressed the\r\nman who wished to fist fight, and the tall captain, flushing at the\r\nlittle fanfare of the red-bearded one, was obliged to look intently at\r\nsome trees.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s tender flesh was deeply stung by these remarks. From under\r\nhis creased brows he glowered with hate at the mockers. He meditated\r\nupon a few revenges. Still, many in the regiment hung their heads in\r\ncriminal fashion, so that it came to pass that the men trudged with\r\nsudden heaviness, as if they bore upon their bended shoulders the\r\ncoffin of their honor. And the youthful lieutenant, recollecting\r\nhimself, began to mutter softly in black curses.\r\n\r\nThey turned when they arrived at their old position to regard the\r\nground over which they had charged.\r\n\r\nThe youth in this contemplation was smitten with a large astonishment.\r\nHe discovered that the distances, as compared with the brilliant\r\nmeasurings of his mind, were trivial and ridiculous. The stolid trees,\r\nwhere much had taken place, seemed incredibly near. The time, too, now\r\nthat he reflected, he saw to have been short. He wondered at the number\r\nof emotions and events that had been crowded into such little spaces.\r\nElfin thoughts must have exaggerated and enlarged everything, he said.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, then, that there was bitter justice in the speeches of the\r\ngaunt and bronzed veterans. He veiled a glance of disdain at his\r\nfellows who strewed the ground, choking with dust, red from\r\nperspiration, misty-eyed, disheveled.\r\n\r\nThey were gulping at their canteens, fierce to wring every mite of\r\nwater from them, and they polished at their swollen and watery features\r\nwith coat sleeves and bunches of grass.\r\n\r\nHowever, to the youth there was a considerable joy in musing upon his\r\nperformances during the charge. He had had very little time previously\r\nin which to appreciate himself, so that there was now much satisfaction\r\nin quietly thinking of his actions. He recalled bits of color that in\r\nthe flurry had stamped themselves unawares upon his engaged senses.\r\n\r\nAs the regiment lay heaving from its hot exertions the officer who had\r\nnamed them as mule drivers came galloping along the line. He had lost\r\nhis cap. His tousled hair streamed wildly, and his face was dark with\r\nvexation and wrath. His temper was displayed with more clearness by the\r\nway in which he managed his horse. He jerked and wrenched savagely at\r\nhis bridle, stopping the hard-breathing animal with a furious pull near\r\nthe colonel of the regiment. He immediately exploded in reproaches\r\nwhich came unbidden to the ears of the men. They were suddenly alert,\r\nbeing always curious about black words between officers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thunder, MacChesnay, what an awful bull you made of this thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbegan the officer. He attempted low tones, but his indignation caused\r\ncertain of the men to learn the sense of his words. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an awful mess\r\nyou made! Good Lord, man, you stopped about a hundred feet this side of\r\na very pretty success! If your men had gone a hundred feet farther you\r\nwould have made a great charge, but as it is\xe2\x80\x94what a lot of mud diggers\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got anyway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men, listening with bated breath, now turned their curious eyes\r\nupon the colonel. They had a ragamuffin interest in this affair.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was seen to straighten his form and put one hand forth in\r\noratorical fashion. He wore an injured air; it was as if a deacon had\r\nbeen accused of stealing. The men were wiggling in an ecstasy of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nBut of a sudden the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed from that of a deacon to\r\nthat of a Frenchman. He shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, general, we\r\nwent as far as we could,\xe2\x80\x9d he said calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as you could? Did you, b\xe2\x80\x99Gawd?\xe2\x80\x9d snorted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t very far, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a glance of cold contempt into\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNot very far, I think. You were intended to make a\r\ndiversion in favor of Whiterside. How well you succeeded your own ears\r\ncan now tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He wheeled his horse and rode stiffly away.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, bidden to hear the jarring noises of an engagement in the\r\nwoods to the left, broke out in vague damnations.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, who had listened with an air of impotent rage to the\r\ninterview, spoke suddenly in firm and undaunted tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwhat a man is\xe2\x80\x94whether he is a general or what\xe2\x80\x94if he says th\xe2\x80\x99 boys\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t put up a good fight out there he\xe2\x80\x99s a damned fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d began the colonel, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my own affair, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant made an obedient gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, colonel, all\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He sat down with an air of being content with himself.\r\n\r\nThe news that the regiment had been reproached went along the line. For\r\na time the men were bewildered by it. \xe2\x80\x9cGood thunder!\xe2\x80\x9d they ejaculated,\r\nstaring at the vanishing form of the general. They conceived it to be a\r\nhuge mistake.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, they began to believe that in truth their efforts\r\nhad been called light. The youth could see this conviction weigh upon\r\nthe entire regiment until the men were like cuffed and cursed animals,\r\nbut withal rebellious.\r\n\r\nThe friend, with a grievance in his eye, went to the youth. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nwhat he does want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must think we went out there an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nplayed marbles! I never see sech a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth developed a tranquil philosophy for these moments of\r\nirritation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9che probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing of\r\nit at all and god mad as blazes, and concluded we were a lot of sheep,\r\njust because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what he wanted done. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity old Grandpa\r\nHenderson got killed yestirday\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d have known that we did our best and\r\nfought good. It\xe2\x80\x99s just our awful luck, that\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friend. He seemed to be deeply wounded\r\nat an injustice. \xe2\x80\x9cI should say we did have awful luck! There\xe2\x80\x99s no fun\r\nin fightin\xe2\x80\x99 fer people when everything yeh do\xe2\x80\x94no matter what\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t done\r\nright. I have a notion t\xe2\x80\x99 stay behind next time an\xe2\x80\x99 let \xe2\x80\x99em take their\r\nol\xe2\x80\x99 charge an\xe2\x80\x99 go t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 devil with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth spoke soothingly to his comrade. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we both did good. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to see the fool what\xe2\x80\x99d say we both didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as good as we could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we did,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the friend stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d break th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeller\xe2\x80\x99s neck if he was as big as a church. But we\xe2\x80\x99re all right,\r\nanyhow, for I heard one feller say that we two fit th\xe2\x80\x99 best in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreg\xe2\x80\x99ment, an\xe2\x80\x99 they had a great argument \xe2\x80\x99bout it. Another feller, \xe2\x80\x99a\r\ncourse, he had t\xe2\x80\x99 up an\xe2\x80\x99 say it was a lie\xe2\x80\x94he seen all what was goin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 he never seen us from th\xe2\x80\x99 beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 end. An\xe2\x80\x99 a lot more\r\nstuck in an\xe2\x80\x99 ses it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lie\xe2\x80\x94we did fight like thunder, an\xe2\x80\x99 they\r\ngive us quite a sendoff. But this is what I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\xe2\x80\x94these\r\neverlastin\xe2\x80\x99 ol\xe2\x80\x99 soldiers, titterin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 laughin\xe2\x80\x99, an then that general,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth exclaimed with sudden exasperation: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a lunkhead!

Their faces\r\nexpressed a bringing of great news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Flem, yeh jest oughta heard!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard what?\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh jest oughta heard!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the other, and he arranged himself to\r\ntell his tidings. The others made an excited circle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncolonel met your lieutenant right by us\xe2\x80\x94it was damnedest thing I ever\r\nheard\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 he ses: \xe2\x80\x98Ahem! ahem!\xe2\x80\x99 he ses. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Hasbrouck!\xe2\x80\x99 he ses, \xe2\x80\x98by\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 way, who was that lad what carried th\xe2\x80\x99 flag?\xe2\x80\x99 he ses.

They exchanged a secret\r\nglance of joy and congratulation.\r\n\r\nThey speedily forgot many things. The past held no pictures of error\r\nand disappointment. They were very happy, and their hearts swelled with\r\ngrateful affection for the colonel and the youthful lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the woods again began to pour forth the dark-hued masses of the\r\nenemy the youth felt serene self-confidence. He smiled briefly when he\r\nsaw men dodge and duck at the long screechings of shells that were\r\nthrown in giant handfuls over them. He stood, erect and tranquil,\r\nwatching the attack begin against apart of the line that made a blue\r\ncurve along the side of an adjacent hill. His vision being unmolested\r\nby smoke from the rifles of his companions, he had opportunities to see\r\nparts of the hard fight. It was a relief to perceive at last from\r\nwhence came some of these noises which had been roared into his ears.\r\n\r\nOff a short way he saw two regiments fighting a little separate battle\r\nwith two other regiments. It was in a cleared space, wearing a\r\nset-apart look. They were blazing as if upon a wager, giving and taking\r\ntremendous blows. The firings were incredibly fierce and rapid. These\r\nintent regiments apparently were oblivious of all larger purposes of\r\nwar, and were slugging each other as if at a matched game.\r\n\r\nIn another direction he saw a magnificent brigade going with the\r\nevident intention of driving the enemy from a wood. They passed in out\r\nof sight and presently there was a most awe-inspiring racket in the\r\nwood. The noise was unspeakable. Having stirred this prodigious uproar,\r\nand, apparently, finding it too prodigious, the brigade, after a little\r\ntime, came marching airily out again with its fine formation in nowise\r\ndisturbed. There were no traces of speed in its movements. The brigade\r\nwas jaunty and seemed to point a proud thumb at the yelling wood.\r\n\r\nOn a slope to the left there was a long row of guns, gruff and\r\nmaddened, denouncing the enemy, who, down through the woods, were\r\nforming for another attack in the pitiless monotony of conflicts. The\r\nround red discharges from the guns made a crimson flare and a high,\r\nthick smoke. Occasional glimpses could be caught of groups of the\r\ntoiling artillerymen. In the rear of this row of guns stood a house,\r\ncalm and white, amid bursting shells. A congregation of horses, tied to\r\na long railing, were tugging frenziedly at their bridles. Men were\r\nrunning hither and thither.\r\n\r\nThe detached battle between the four regiments lasted for some time.\r\nThere chanced to be no interference, and they settled their dispute by\r\nthemselves. They struck savagely and powerfully at each other for a\r\nperiod of minutes, and then the lighter-hued regiments faltered and\r\ndrew back, leaving the dark-blue lines shouting. The youth could see\r\nthe two flags shaking with laughter amid the smoke remnants.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a stillness, pregnant with meaning. The blue lines\r\nshifted and changed a trifle and stared expectantly at the silent woods\r\nand fields before them. The hush was solemn and churchlike, save for a\r\ndistant battery that, evidently unable to remain quiet, sent a faint\r\nrolling thunder over the ground. It irritated, like the noises of\r\nunimpressed boys. The men imagined that it would prevent their perched\r\nears from hearing the first words of the new battle.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden the guns on the slope roared out a message of warning. A\r\nspluttering sound had begun in the woods. It swelled with amazing speed\r\nto a profound clamor that involved the earth in noises. The splitting\r\ncrashes swept along the lines until an interminable roar was developed.\r\nTo those in the midst of it it became a din fitted to the universe. It\r\nwas the whirring and thumping of gigantic machinery, complications\r\namong the smaller stars. The youth\xe2\x80\x99s ears were filled cups. They were\r\nincapable of hearing more.\r\n\r\nOn an incline over which a road wound he saw wild and desperate rushes\r\nof men perpetually backward and forward in riotous surges. These parts\r\nof the opposing armies were two long waves that pitched upon each other\r\nmadly at dictated points. To and fro they swelled. Sometimes, one side\r\nby its yells and cheers would proclaim decisive blows, but a moment\r\nlater the other side would be all yells and cheers. Once the youth saw\r\na spray of light forms go in houndlike leaps toward the waving blue\r\nlines. There was much howling, and presently it went away with a vast\r\nmouthful of prisoners. Again, he saw a blue wave dash with such\r\nthunderous force against a gray obstruction that it seemed to clear the\r\nearth of it and leave nothing but trampled sod. And always in their\r\nswift and deadly rushes to and fro the men screamed and yelled like\r\nmaniacs.\r\n\r\nParticular pieces of fence or secure positions behind collections of\r\ntrees were wrangled over, as gold thrones or pearl bedsteads. There\r\nwere desperate lunges at these chosen spots seemingly every instant,\r\nand most of them were bandied like light toys between the contending\r\nforces. The youth could not tell from the battle flags flying like\r\ncrimson foam in many directions which color of cloth was winning.\r\n\r\nHis emaciated regiment bustled forth with undiminished fierceness when\r\nits time came. When assaulted again by bullets, the men burst out in a\r\nbarbaric cry of rage and pain. They bent their heads in aims of intent\r\nhatred behind the projected hammers of their guns. Their ramrods\r\nclanged loud with fury as their eager arms pounded the cartridges into\r\nthe rifle barrels. The front of the regiment was a smoke-wall\r\npenetrated by the flashing points of yellow and red.\r\n\r\nWallowing in the fight, they were in an astonishingly short time\r\nresmudged. They surpassed in stain and dirt all their previous\r\nappearances. Moving to and fro with strained exertion, jabbering all\r\nthe while, they were, with their swaying bodies, black faces, and\r\nglowing eyes, like strange and ugly fiends jigging heavily in the\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, returning from a tour after a bandage, produced from a\r\nhidden receptacle of his mind new and portentous oaths suited to the\r\nemergency. Strings of expletives he swung lashlike over the backs of\r\nhis men, and it was evident that his previous efforts had in nowise\r\nimpaired his resources.\r\n\r\nThe youth, still the bearer of the colors, did not feel his idleness.\r\nHe was deeply absorbed as a spectator. The crash and swing of the great\r\ndrama made him lean forward, intent-eyed, his face working in small\r\ncontortions. Sometimes he prattled, words coming unconsciously from him\r\nin grotesque exclamations. He did not know that he breathed; that the\r\nflag hung silently over him, so absorbed was he.\r\n\r\nA formidable line of the enemy came within dangerous range. They could\r\nbe seen plainly\xe2\x80\x94tall, gaunt men with excited faces running with long\r\nstrides toward a wandering fence.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this danger the men suddenly ceased their cursing monotone.\r\nThere was an instant of strained silence before they threw up their\r\nrifles and fired a plumping volley at the foes. There had been no order\r\ngiven; the men, upon recognizing the menace, had immediately let drive\r\ntheir flock of bullets without waiting for word of command.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy were quick to gain the protection of the wandering line\r\nof fence. They slid down behind it with remarkable celerity, and from\r\nthis position they began briskly to slice up the blue men.\r\n\r\nThese latter braced their energies for a great struggle. Often, white\r\nclinched teeth shone from the dusky faces. Many heads surged to and\r\nfro, floating upon a pale sea of smoke. Those behind the fence\r\nfrequently shouted and yelped in taunts and gibelike cries, but the\r\nregiment maintained a stressed silence. Perhaps, at this new assault\r\nthe men recalled the fact that they had been named mud diggers, and it\r\nmade their situation thrice bitter. They were breathlessly intent upon\r\nkeeping the ground and thrusting away the rejoicing body of the enemy.\r\nThey fought swiftly and with a despairing savageness denoted in their\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nThe youth had resolved not to budge whatever should happen. Some arrows\r\nof scorn that had buried themselves in his heart had generated strange\r\nand unspeakable hatred. It was clear to him that his final and absolute\r\nrevenge was to be achieved by his dead body lying, torn and gluttering,\r\nupon the field. This was to be a poignant retaliation upon the officer\r\nwho had said \xe2\x80\x9cmule drivers,\xe2\x80\x9d and later \xe2\x80\x9cmud diggers,\xe2\x80\x9d for in all the\r\nwild graspings of his mind for a unit responsible for his sufferings\r\nand commotions he always seized upon the man who had dubbed him\r\nwrongly. And it was his idea, vaguely formulated, that his corpse would\r\nbe for those eyes a great and salt reproach.\r\n\r\nThe regiment bled extravagantly. Grunting bundles of blue began to\r\ndrop. The orderly sergeant of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s company was shot through the\r\ncheeks. Its supports being injured, his jaw hung afar down, disclosing\r\nin the wide cavern of his mouth a pulsing mass of blood and teeth. And\r\nwith it all he made attempts to cry out. In his endeavor there was a\r\ndreadful earnestness, as if he conceived that one great shriek would\r\nmake him well.\r\n\r\nThe youth saw him presently go rearward. His strength seemed in nowise\r\nimpaired. He ran swiftly, casting wild glances for succor.\r\n\r\nOthers fell down about the feet of their companions. Some of the\r\nwounded crawled out and away, but many lay still, their bodies twisted\r\ninto impossible shapes.\r\n\r\nThe youth looked once for his friend. He saw a vehement young man,\r\npowder-smeared and frowzled, whom he knew to be him. The lieutenant,\r\nalso, was unscathed in his position at the rear. He had continued to\r\ncurse, but it was now with the air of a man who was using his last box\r\nof oaths.\r\n\r\nFor the fire of the regiment had begun to wane and drip. The robust\r\nvoice, that had come strangely from the thin ranks, was growing rapidly\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colonel came running along the back of the line. There were other\r\nofficers following him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must charge \xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must\r\ncharge \xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried with resentful voices, as if anticipating a\r\nrebellion against this plan by the men.\r\n\r\nThe youth, upon hearing the shouts, began to study the distance between\r\nhim and the enemy. He made vague calculations. He saw that to be firm\r\nsoldiers they must go forward. It would be death to stay in the present\r\nplace, and with all the circumstances to go backward would exalt too\r\nmany others. Their hope was to push the galling foes away from the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nHe expected that his companions, weary and stiffened, would have to be\r\ndriven to this assault, but as he turned toward them he perceived with\r\na certain surprise that they were giving quick and unqualified\r\nexpressions of assent. There was an ominous, clanging overture to the\r\ncharge when the shafts of the bayonets rattled upon the rifle barrels.\r\nAt the yelled words of command the soldiers sprang forward in eager\r\nleaps. There was new and unexpected force in the movement of the\r\nregiment. A knowledge of its faded and jaded condition made the charge\r\nappear like a paroxysm, a display of the strength that comes before a\r\nfinal feebleness. The men scampered in insane fever of haste, racing as\r\nif to achieve a sudden success before an exhilarating fluid should\r\nleave them. It was a blind and despairing rush by the collection of men\r\nin dusty and tattered blue, over a green sward and under a sapphire\r\nsky, toward a fence, dimly outlined in smoke, from behind which\r\nsputtered the fierce rifles of enemies.\r\n\r\nThe youth kept the bright colors to the front. He was waving his free\r\narm in furious circles, the while shrieking mad calls and appeals,\r\nurging on those that did not need to be urged, for it seemed that the\r\nmob of blue men hurling themselves on the dangerous group of rifles\r\nwere again grown suddenly wild with an enthusiasm of unselfishness.\r\nFrom the many firings starting toward them, it looked as if they would\r\nmerely succeed in making a great sprinkling of corpses on the grass\r\nbetween their former position and the fence. But they were in a state\r\nof frenzy, perhaps because of forgotten vanities, and it made an\r\nexhibition of sublime recklessness. There was no obvious questioning,\r\nnor figurings, nor diagrams. There was, apparently, no considered\r\nloopholes. It appeared that the swift wings of their desires would have\r\nshattered against the iron gates of the impossible.\r\n\r\nHe himself felt the daring spirit of a savage, religion-mad. He was\r\ncapable of profound sacrifices, a tremendous death. He had no time for\r\ndissections, but he knew that he thought of the bullets only as things\r\nthat could prevent him from reaching the place of his endeavor. There\r\nwere subtle flashings of joy within him that thus should be his mind.\r\n\r\nHe strained all his strength. His eyesight was shaken and dazzled by\r\nthe tension of thought and muscle. He did not see anything excepting\r\nthe mist of smoke gashed by the little knives of fire, but he knew that\r\nin it lay the aged fence of a vanished farmer protecting the snuggled\r\nbodies of the gray men.\r\n\r\nAs he ran a thought of the shock of contact gleamed in his mind. He\r\nexpected a great concussion when the two bodies of troops crashed\r\ntogether. This became a part of his wild battle madness. He could feel\r\nthe onward swing of the regiment about him and he conceived of a\r\nthunderous, crushing blow that would prostrate the resistance and\r\nspread consternation and amazement for miles. The flying regiment was\r\ngoing to have a catapultian effect. This dream made him run faster\r\namong his comrades, who were giving vent to hoarse and frantic cheers.\r\n\r\nBut presently he could see that many of the men in gray did not intend\r\nto abide the blow. The smoke, rolling, disclosed men who ran, their\r\nfaces still turned. These grew to a crowd, who retired stubbornly.\r\nIndividuals wheeled frequently to send a bullet at the blue wave.\r\n\r\nBut at one part of the line there was a grim and obdurate group that\r\nmade no movement. They were settled firmly down behind posts and rails.\r\nA flag, ruffled and fierce, waved over them and their rifles dinned\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\nThe blue whirl of men got very near, until it seemed that in truth\r\nthere would be a close and frightful scuffle. There was an expressed\r\ndisdain in the opposition of the little group, that changed the meaning\r\nof the cheers of the men in blue. They became yells of wrath, directed,\r\npersonal. The cries of the two parties were now in sound an interchange\r\nof scathing insults.\r\n\r\nThey in blue showed their teeth; their eyes shone all white. They\r\nlaunched themselves as at the throats of those who stood resisting. The\r\nspace between dwindled to an insignificant distance.\r\n\r\nThe youth had centered the gaze of his soul upon that other flag. Its\r\npossession would be high pride. It would express bloody minglings, near\r\nblows. He had a gigantic hatred for those who made great difficulties\r\nand complications. They caused it to be as a craved treasure of\r\nmythology, hung amid tasks and contrivances of danger.\r\n\r\nHe plunged like a mad horse at it. He was resolved it should not escape\r\nif wild blows and darings of blows could seize it. His own emblem,\r\nquivering and aflare, was winging toward the other. It seemed there\r\nwould shortly be an encounter of strange beaks and claws, as of eagles.\r\n\r\nThe swirling body of blue men came to a sudden halt at close and\r\ndisastrous range and roared a swift volley. The group in gray was split\r\nand broken by this fire, but its riddled body still fought. The men in\r\nblue yelled again and rushed in upon it.\r\n\r\nThe youth, in his leapings, saw, as through a mist, a picture of four\r\nor five men stretched upon the ground or writhing upon their knees with\r\nbowed heads as if they had been stricken by bolts from the sky.\r\nTottering among them was the rival color bearer, whom the youth saw had\r\nbeen bitten vitally by the bullets of the last formidable volley. He\r\nperceived this man fighting a last struggle, the struggle of one whose\r\nlegs are grasped by demons. It was a ghastly battle. Over his face was\r\nthe bleach of death, but set upon it was the dark and hard lines of\r\ndesperate purpose. With this terrible grin of resolution he hugged his\r\nprecious flag to him and was stumbling and staggering in his design to\r\ngo the way that led to safety for it.\r\n\r\nBut his wounds always made it seem that his feet were retarded, held,\r\nand he fought a grim fight, as with invisible ghouls fastened greedily\r\nupon his limbs. Those in advance of the scampering blue men, howling\r\ncheers, leaped at the fence. The despair of the lost was in his eyes as\r\nhe glanced back at them.\r\n\r\nThe youth\xe2\x80\x99s friend went over the obstruction in a tumbling heap and\r\nsprang at the flag as a panther at prey. He pulled at it and, wrenching\r\nit free, swung up its red brilliancy with a mad cry of exultation even\r\nas the color bearer, gasping, lurched over in a final throe and,\r\nstiffening convulsively, turned his dead face to the ground. There was\r\nmuch blood upon the grass blades.\r\n\r\nAt the place of success there began more wild clamorings of cheers. The\r\nmen gesticulated and bellowed in an ecstasy. When they spoke it was as\r\nif they considered their listener to be a mile away. What hats and caps\r\nwere left to them they often slung high in the air.\r\n\r\nAt one part of the line four men had been swooped upon, and they now\r\nsat as prisoners. Some blue men were about them in an eager and curious\r\ncircle. The soldiers had trapped strange birds, and there was an\r\nexamination. A flurry of fast questions was in the air.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners was nursing a superficial wound in the foot. He\r\ncuddled it, baby-wise, but he looked up from it often to curse with an\r\nastonishing utter abandon straight at the noses of his captors. He\r\nconsigned them to red regions; he called upon the pestilential wrath of\r\nstrange gods. And with it all he was singularly free from recognition\r\nof the finer points of the conduct of prisoners of war. It was as if a\r\nclumsy clod had trod upon his toe and he conceived it to be his\r\nprivilege, his duty, to use deep, resentful oaths.\r\n\r\nAnother, who was a boy in years, took his plight with great calmness\r\nand apparent good nature. He conversed with the men in blue, studying\r\ntheir faces with his bright and keen eyes. They spoke of battles and\r\nconditions. There was an acute interest in all their faces during this\r\nexchange of view points. It seemed a great satisfaction to hear voices\r\nfrom where all had been darkness and speculation.\r\n\r\nThe third captive sat with a morose countenance. He preserved a stoical\r\nand cold attitude. To all advances he made one reply without variation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, go t\xe2\x80\x99 hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last of the four was always silent and, for the most part, kept his\r\nface turned in unmolested directions. From the views the youth received\r\nhe seemed to be in a state of absolute dejection. Shame was upon him,\r\nand with it profound regret that he was, perhaps, no more to be counted\r\nin the ranks of his fellows. The youth could detect no expression that\r\nwould allow him to believe that the other was giving a thought to his\r\nnarrowed future, the pictured dungeons, perhaps, and starvations and\r\nbrutalities, liable to the imagination. All to be seen was shame for\r\ncaptivity and regret for the right to antagonize.\r\n\r\nAfter the men had celebrated sufficiently they settled down behind the\r\nold rail fence, on the opposite side to the one from which their foes\r\nhad been driven. A few shot perfunctorily at distant marks.\r\n\r\nThere was some long grass. The youth nestled in it and rested, making a\r\nconvenient rail support the flag. His friend, jubilant and glorified,\r\nholding his treasure with vanity, came to him there. They sat side by\r\nside and congratulated each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe roarings that had stretched in a long line of sound across the face\r\nof the forest began to grow intermittent and weaker. The stentorian\r\nspeeches of the artillery continued in some distant encounter, but the\r\ncrashes of the musketry had almost ceased. The youth and his friend of\r\na sudden looked up, feeling a deadened form of distress at the waning\r\nof these noises, which had become a part of life. They could see\r\nchanges going on among the troops. There were marchings this way and\r\nthat way. A battery wheeled leisurely. On the crest of a small hill was\r\nthe thick gleam of many departing muskets.\r\n\r\nThe youth arose. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what now, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. By his tone he\r\nseemed to be preparing to resent some new monstrosity in the way of\r\ndins and smashes. He shaded his eyes with his grimy hand and gazed over\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nHis friend also arose and stared. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 git along out\r\nof this an\xe2\x80\x99 back over th\xe2\x80\x99 river,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I swan!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\nThey waited, watching. Within a little while the regiment received\r\norders to retrace its way. The men got up grunting from the grass,\r\nregretting the soft repose. They jerked their stiffened legs, and\r\nstretched their arms over their heads. One man swore as he rubbed his\r\neyes. They all groaned \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d They had as many objections to this\r\nchange as they would have had to a proposal for a new battle.\r\n\r\nThey trampled slowly back over the field across which they had run in a\r\nmad scamper.\r\n\r\nThe regiment marched until it had joined its fellows. The reformed\r\nbrigade, in column, aimed through a wood at the road. Directly they\r\nwere in a mass of dust-covered troops, and were trudging along in a way\r\nparallel to the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s lines as these had been defined by the previous\r\nturmoil.\r\n\r\nThey passed within view of a stolid white house, and saw in front of it\r\ngroups of their comrades lying in wait behind a neat breastwork. A row\r\nof guns were booming at a distant enemy. Shells thrown in reply were\r\nraising clouds of dust and splinters. Horsemen dashed along the line of\r\nintrenchments.\r\n\r\nAt this point of its march the division curved away from the field and\r\nwent winding off in the direction of the river. When the significance\r\nof this movement had impressed itself upon the youth he turned his head\r\nand looked over his shoulder toward the trampled and _d\xc3\xa9bris_-strewed\r\nground. He breathed a breath of new satisfaction. He finally nudged his\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him.\r\n\r\nHis friend gazed backward. \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99Gawd, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented. They mused.\r\n\r\nFor a time the youth was obliged to reflect in a puzzled and uncertain\r\nway. His mind was undergoing a subtle change. It took moments for it to\r\ncast off its battleful ways and resume its accustomed course of\r\nthought. Gradually his brain emerged from the clogged clouds, and at\r\nlast he was enabled to more closely comprehend himself and\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nHe understood then that the existence of shot and countershot was in\r\nthe past. He had dwelt in a land of strange, squalling upheavals and\r\nhad come forth. He had been where there was red of blood and black of\r\npassion, and he was escaped. His first thoughts were given to\r\nrejoicings at this fact.\r\n\r\nLater he began to study his deeds, his failures, and his achievements.\r\nThus, fresh from scenes where many of his usual machines of reflection\r\nhad been idle, from where he had proceeded sheeplike, he struggled to\r\nmarshal all his acts.\r\n\r\nAt last they marched before him clearly. From this present view point\r\nhe was enabled to look upon them in spectator fashion and criticise\r\nthem with some correctness, for his new condition had already defeated\r\ncertain sympathies.\r\n\r\nRegarding his procession of memory he felt gleeful and unregretting,\r\nfor in it his public deeds were paraded in great and shining\r\nprominence. Those performances which had been witnessed by his fellows\r\nmarched now in wide purple and gold, having various deflections. They\r\nwent gayly with music. It was pleasure to watch these things. He spent\r\ndelightful minutes viewing the gilded images of memory.\r\n\r\nHe saw that he was good. He recalled with a thrill of joy the\r\nrespectful comments of his fellows upon his conduct.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the ghost of his flight from the first engagement\r\nappeared to him and danced. There were small shoutings in his brain\r\nabout these matters. For a moment he blushed, and the light of his soul\r\nflickered with shame.\r\n\r\nA specter of reproach came to him. There loomed the dogging memory of\r\nthe tattered soldier\xe2\x80\x94he who, gored by bullets and faint of blood, had\r\nfretted concerning an imagined wound in another; he who had loaned his\r\nlast of strength and intellect for the tall soldier; he who, blind with\r\nweariness and pain, had been deserted in the field.\r\n\r\nFor an instant a wretched chill of sweat was upon him at the thought\r\nthat he might be detected in the thing. As he stood persistently before\r\nhis vision, he gave vent to a cry of sharp irritation and agony.\r\n\r\nHis friend turned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. The youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply was an outburst of crimson oaths.\r\n\r\nAs he marched along the little branch-hung roadway among his prattling\r\ncompanions this vision of cruelty brooded over him. It clung near him\r\nalways and darkened his view of these deeds in purple and gold.\r\nWhichever way his thoughts turned they were followed by the somber\r\nphantom of the desertion in the fields. He looked stealthily at his\r\ncompanions, feeling sure that they must discern in his face evidences\r\nof this pursuit. But they were plodding in ragged array, discussing\r\nwith quick tongues the accomplishments of the late battle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if a man should come up an\xe2\x80\x99 ask me, I\xe2\x80\x99d say we got a dum good\r\nlickin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLickin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94in yer eye! We ain\xe2\x80\x99t licked, sonny. We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 down here\r\naways, swing aroun\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 come in behint \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hush, with your comin\xe2\x80\x99 in behint \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all \xe2\x80\x99a that I\r\nwanta. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about comin\xe2\x80\x99 in behint\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Smithers, he ses he\xe2\x80\x99d rather been in ten hundred battles than\r\nbeen in that heluva hospital. He ses they got shootin\xe2\x80\x99 in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnighttime, an\xe2\x80\x99 shells dropped plum among \xe2\x80\x99em in th\xe2\x80\x99 hospital. He ses\r\nsech hollerin\xe2\x80\x99 he never see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasbrouck? He\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 best off\xe2\x80\x99cer in this here reg\xe2\x80\x99ment. He\xe2\x80\x99s a whale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell yeh we\xe2\x80\x99d come aroun\xe2\x80\x99 in behint \xe2\x80\x99em? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell yeh\r\nso? We\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shet yeh mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a time this pursuing recollection of the tattered man took all\r\nelation from the youth\xe2\x80\x99s veins. He saw his vivid error, and he was\r\nafraid that it would stand before him all his life. He took no share in\r\nthe chatter of his comrades, nor did he look at them or know them, save\r\nwhen he felt sudden suspicion that they were seeing his thoughts and\r\nscrutinizing each detail of the scene with the tattered soldier.\r\n\r\nYet gradually he mustered force to put the sin at a distance. And at\r\nlast his eyes seemed to open to some new ways. He found that he could\r\nlook back upon the brass and bombast of his earlier gospels and see\r\nthem truly. He was gleeful when he discovered that he now despised\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction came a store of assurance. He felt a quiet\r\nmanhood, nonassertive but of sturdy and strong blood. He knew that he\r\nwould no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. He\r\nhad been to touch the great death, and found that, after all, it was\r\nbut the great death. He was a man.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that as he trudged from the place of blood and wrath\r\nhis soul changed. He came from hot plowshares to prospects of clover\r\ntranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares were not. Scars faded as\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nIt rained. The procession of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train,\r\ndespondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of\r\nliquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for\r\nhe saw that the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to\r\nbe made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red\r\nsickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been\r\nan animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned\r\nnow with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows,\r\ncool brooks\xe2\x80\x94an existence of soft and eternal peace.\r\n\r\nOver the river a golden ray of sun came through the hosts of leaden\r\nrain clouds.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
