This is what I undertake to do for you, reader. With this drop of\r\nink at the end of my pen, I will show you the roomy workshop of Mr.\r\nJonathan Burge, carpenter and builder, in the village of Hayslope, as\r\nit appeared on the eighteenth of June, in the year of our Lord 1799.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors\r\nand window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pine-wood from a tentlike\r\npile of planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of\r\nthe elder-bushes which were spreading their summer snow close to the\r\nopen window opposite; the slanting sunbeams shone through the\r\ntransparent shavings that flew before the steady plane, and lit up the\r\nfine grain of the oak panelling which stood propped against the wall.\r\nOn a heap of those soft shavings a rough, grey shepherd dog had made\r\nhimself a pleasant bed, and was lying with his nose between his\r\nfore-paws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the\r\ntallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of\r\na wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong barytone\r\nbelonged which was heard above the sound of plane and hammer singing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAwake, my soul, and with the sun\r\nThy daily stage of duty run;\r\nShake off dull sloth...\r\n\r\n\r\nHere some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated\r\nattention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle; but it\r\npresently broke out again with renewed vigour\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLet all thy converse be sincere,\r\nThy conscience as the noonday clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest\r\nbelonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a\r\nback so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to\r\ntake a more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier\r\nstanding at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm\r\nthat was likely to win the prize for feats of strength; yet the long\r\nsupple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready for works of\r\nskill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified\r\nhis name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its\r\ncontrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes\r\nthat shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows,\r\nindicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly\r\nhewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an\r\nexpression of good-humoured honest intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He is\r\nnearly as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair\r\nand complexion; but the strength of the family likeness seems only to\r\nrender more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in\r\nform and face. Seth\xe2\x80\x99s broad shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are\r\ngrey; his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s; and his glance, instead of being keen, is confiding and\r\nbenign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is\r\nnot thick and straight, like Adam\xe2\x80\x99s, but thin and wavy, allowing you to\r\ndiscern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very\r\ndecidedly over the brow.\r\n\r\nThe idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth;\r\nthey scarcely ever spoke to Adam.\r\n\r\nThe concert of the tools and Adam\xe2\x80\x99s voice was at last broken by Seth,\r\nwho, lifting the door at which he had been working intently, placed it\r\nagainst the wall, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere! I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished my door to-day,\r\nanyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workmen all looked up; Jim Salt, a burly, red-haired man known as\r\nSandy Jim, paused from his planing, and Adam said to Seth, with a sharp\r\nglance of surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Dost think thee\xe2\x80\x99st finished the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, with answering surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s awanting\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made Seth look\r\nround confusedly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but there was a\r\nslight smile on his face as he said, in a gentler tone than before,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee\xe2\x80\x99st forgot the panels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his hands to his head,\r\nand coloured over brow and crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoorray!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben, running\r\nforward and seizing the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hang up th\xe2\x80\x99 door at fur end o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshop an\xe2\x80\x99 write on\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98Seth Bede, the Methody, his work.\xe2\x80\x99 Here, Jim,\r\nlend\xe2\x80\x99s hould o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 red pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it alone, Ben Cranage. You\xe2\x80\x99ll mayhap be\r\nmaking such a slip yourself some day; you\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 other side o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour mouth then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me at it, Adam. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good while afore my head\xe2\x80\x99s full o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 Methodies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but it\xe2\x80\x99s often full o\xe2\x80\x99 drink, and that\xe2\x80\x99s worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen, however, had now got the \xe2\x80\x9cred pot\xe2\x80\x9d in his hand, and was about to\r\nbegin writing his inscription, making, by way of preliminary, an\r\nimaginary S in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it alone, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam called out, laying down his tools,\r\nstriding up to Ben, and seizing his right shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it alone, or\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll shake the soul out o\xe2\x80\x99 your body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen shook in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s iron grasp, but, like a plucky small man as he was,\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to give in. With his left hand he snatched the brush\r\nfrom his powerless right, and made a movement as if he would perform\r\nthe feat of writing with his left. In a moment Adam turned him round,\r\nseized his other shoulder, and, pushing him along, pinned him against\r\nthe wall. But now Seth spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet be, Addy, let be. Ben will be joking. Why, he\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 the right to\r\nlaugh at me\xe2\x80\x94I canna help laughing at myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t loose him till he promises to let the door alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ben, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, in a persuasive tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s have a\r\nquarrel about it. You know Adam will have his way. You may\xe2\x80\x99s well try\r\nto turn a waggon in a narrow lane. Say you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the door alone, and\r\nmake an end on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI binna frighted at Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I donna mind sayin\xe2\x80\x99 as I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlet \xe2\x80\x99t alone at your askin\xe2\x80\x99, Seth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s wise of you, Ben,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, laughing and relaxing his\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nThey all returned to their work now; but Wiry Ben, having had the worst\r\nin the bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a\r\nsuccess in sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich was ye thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 on, Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d he began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe pretty parson\xe2\x80\x99s face or\r\nher sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and hear her, Ben,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, good-humouredly; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\npreach on the Green to-night; happen ye\xe2\x80\x99d get something to think on\r\nyourself then, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 those wicked songs you\xe2\x80\x99re so fond on. Ye\r\nmight get religion, and that \xe2\x80\x99ud be the best day\xe2\x80\x99s earnings y\xe2\x80\x99 ever\r\nmade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll i\xe2\x80\x99 good time for that, Seth; I\xe2\x80\x99ll think about that when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to settle i\xe2\x80\x99 life; bachelors doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want such heavy earnin\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHappen I shall do the coortin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 the religion both together, as _ye_\r\ndo, Seth; but ye wouldna ha\xe2\x80\x99 me get converted an\xe2\x80\x99 chop in atween ye an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe pretty preacher, an\xe2\x80\x99 carry her aff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear o\xe2\x80\x99 that, Ben; she\xe2\x80\x99s neither for you nor for me to win, I\r\ndoubt. Only you come and hear her, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t speak lightly on her\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m half a mind t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 a look at her to-night, if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngood company at th\xe2\x80\x99 Holly Bush. What\xe2\x80\x99ll she take for her text? Happen\r\nye can tell me, Seth, if so be as I shouldna come up i\xe2\x80\x99 time for\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nWill\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94what come ye out for to see? A prophetess? Yea, I say unto\r\nyou, and more than a prophetess\xe2\x80\x94a uncommon pretty young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ben,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, rather sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou let the words o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible\r\nalone; you\xe2\x80\x99re going too far now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Are _ye_ a-turnin\xe2\x80\x99 roun\xe2\x80\x99, Adam? I thought ye war dead again th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwomen preachin\xe2\x80\x99, a while agoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not turnin\xe2\x80\x99 noway. I said nought about the women preachin\xe2\x80\x99. I\r\nsaid, You let the Bible alone: you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a jest-book, han\xe2\x80\x99t you, as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re rare and proud on? Keep your dirty fingers to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, y\xe2\x80\x99 are gettin\xe2\x80\x99 as big a saint as Seth. Y\xe2\x80\x99 are goin\xe2\x80\x99 to th\xe2\x80\x99\r\npreachin\xe2\x80\x99 to-night, I should think. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll do finely t\xe2\x80\x99 lead the\r\nsingin\xe2\x80\x99. But I don\xe2\x80\x99 know what Parson Irwine \xe2\x80\x99ull say at his gran\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfavright Adam Bede a-turnin\xe2\x80\x99 Methody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever do you bother yourself about me, Ben. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a-going to turn\r\nMethodist any more nor you are\xe2\x80\x94though it\xe2\x80\x99s like enough you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to\r\nsomething worse. Mester Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s got more sense nor to meddle wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s doing as they like in religion. That\xe2\x80\x99s between themselves and\r\nGod, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said to me many a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye; but he\xe2\x80\x99s none so fond o\xe2\x80\x99 your dissenters, for all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe; I\xe2\x80\x99m none so fond o\xe2\x80\x99 Josh Tod\xe2\x80\x99s thick ale, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t hinder\r\nyou from making a fool o\xe2\x80\x99 yourself wi\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a laugh at this thrust of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s, but Seth said, very\r\nseriously. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Addy, thee mustna say as anybody\xe2\x80\x99s religion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike thick ale. Thee dostna believe but what the dissenters and the\r\nMethodists have got the root o\xe2\x80\x99 the matter as well as the church\r\nfolks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Seth, lad; I\xe2\x80\x99m not for laughing at no man\xe2\x80\x99s religion. Let \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nfollow their consciences, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Only I think it \xe2\x80\x99ud be better if\r\ntheir consciences \xe2\x80\x99ud let \xe2\x80\x99em stay quiet i\xe2\x80\x99 the church\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal\r\nto be learnt there. And there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as being oversperitial; we\r\nmust have something beside Gospel i\xe2\x80\x99 this world. Look at the canals,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 aqueduc\xe2\x80\x99s, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 coal-pit engines, and Arkwright\xe2\x80\x99s mills\r\nthere at Cromford; a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them\r\nthings, I reckon. But t\xe2\x80\x99 hear some o\xe2\x80\x99 them preachers, you\xe2\x80\x99d think as a\r\nman must be doing nothing all\xe2\x80\x99s life but shutting\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and looking\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s agoing on inside him. I know a man must have the love o\xe2\x80\x99 God in\r\nhis soul, and the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s word. But what does the Bible say? Why,\r\nit says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the\r\ntabernacle, to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a\r\nnice hand. And this is my way o\xe2\x80\x99 looking at it: there\xe2\x80\x99s the sperrit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nGod in all things and all times\xe2\x80\x94weekday as well as Sunday\xe2\x80\x94and i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ngreat works and inventions, and i\xe2\x80\x99 the figuring and the mechanics. And\r\nGod helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our\r\nsouls; and if a man does bits o\xe2\x80\x99 jobs out o\xe2\x80\x99 working hours\xe2\x80\x94builds a\r\noven for \xe2\x80\x99s wife to save her from going to the bakehouse, or scrats at\r\nhis bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o\xe2\x80\x99 one, he\xe2\x80\x99s doin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmore good, and he\xe2\x80\x99s just as near to God, as if he was running after\r\nsome preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Adam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his planing to\r\nshift his planks while Adam was speaking; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the best sarmunt I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheared this long while. By th\xe2\x80\x99 same token, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s been a-plaguin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nme to build her a oven this twelvemont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s reason in what thee say\xe2\x80\x99st, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Seth, gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee know\xe2\x80\x99st thyself as it\xe2\x80\x99s hearing the preachers thee find\xe2\x80\x99st so\r\nmuch fault with has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the preacher as empties th\xe2\x80\x99 alehouse; and if a man gets religion,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll do his work none the worse for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn\xe2\x80\x99y he\xe2\x80\x99ll lave the panels out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 doors sometimes, eh, Seth?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWiry Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ben, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a joke again\xe2\x80\x99 me as \xe2\x80\x99ll last you your life. But it\r\nisna religion as was i\xe2\x80\x99 fault there; it was Seth Bede, as was allays a\r\nwool-gathering chap, and religion hasna cured him, the more\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNe\xe2\x80\x99er heed me, Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wiry Ben, \xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x80\x99 are a down-right good-hearted\r\nchap, panels or no panels; an\xe2\x80\x99 ye donna set up your bristles at every\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 fun, like some o\xe2\x80\x99 your kin, as is mayhap cliverer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeth, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cthee mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in what I\r\nsaid just now. Some \xe2\x80\x99s got one way o\xe2\x80\x99 looking at things and some \xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Addy, thee mean\xe2\x80\x99st me no unkindness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nthat well enough. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t like thy dog Gyp\xe2\x80\x94thee bark\xe2\x80\x99st at me sometimes,\r\nbut thee allays lick\xe2\x80\x99st my hand after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the church clock\r\nbegan to strike six. Before the first stroke had died away, Sandy Jim\r\nhad loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket; Wiry Ben had left a\r\nscrew half driven in, and thrown his screwdriver into his tool-basket;\r\nMum Taft, who, true to his name, had kept silence throughout the\r\nprevious conversation, had flung down his hammer as he was in the act\r\nof lifting it; and Seth, too, had straightened his back, and was\r\nputting out his hand towards his paper cap. Adam alone had gone on with\r\nhis work as if nothing had happened. But observing the cessation of the\r\ntools, he looked up, and said, in a tone of indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cLook there,\r\nnow! I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide to see men throw away their tools i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, the\r\nminute the clock begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure i\xe2\x80\x99 their\r\nwork and was afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 doing a stroke too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth looked a little conscious, and began to be slower in his\r\npreparations for going, but Mum Taft broke silence, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAye,\r\naye, Adam lad, ye talk like a young un. When y\xe2\x80\x99 are six-an\xe2\x80\x99-forty like\r\nme, istid o\xe2\x80\x99 six-an\xe2\x80\x99-twenty, ye wonna be so flush o\xe2\x80\x99 workin\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nnought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, still wrathful; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s age got to do with it, I\r\nwonder? Ye arena getting stiff yet, I reckon. I hate to see a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms drop down as if he was shot, before the clock\xe2\x80\x99s fairly struck,\r\njust as if he\xe2\x80\x99d never a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pride and delight in \xe2\x80\x99s work. The very\r\ngrindstone \xe2\x80\x99ull go on turning a bit after you loose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBodderation, Adam!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wiry Ben; \xe2\x80\x9clave a chap aloon, will \xe2\x80\x99ee?\r\nYe war afinding faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 preachers a while agoo\xe2\x80\x94y\xe2\x80\x99 are fond enough o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npreachin\xe2\x80\x99 yoursen. Ye may like work better nor play, but I like play\r\nbetter nor work; that\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99commodate ye\xe2\x80\x94it laves ye th\xe2\x80\x99 more to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this exit speech, which he considered effective, Wiry Ben\r\nshouldered his basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by Mum\r\nTaft and Sandy Jim. Seth lingered, and looked wistfully at Adam, as if\r\nhe expected him to say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShalt go home before thee go\xe2\x80\x99st to the preaching?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam asked, looking\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my hat and things at Will Maskery\xe2\x80\x99s. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be home\r\nbefore going for ten. I\xe2\x80\x99ll happen see Dinah Morris safe home, if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody comes with her from Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s, thee know\xe2\x80\x99st.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell mother not to look for thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee artna going to Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s thyself to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth rather\r\ntimidly, as he turned to leave the workshop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to th\xe2\x80\x99 school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and\r\nwatching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing.\r\nBut no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist\r\nhis apron round his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s face with patient expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would\r\ndoubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his\r\nemotions, he was like many other worthy personages, destined to appear\r\nmore phlegmatic than nature had made him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, with the same\r\ngentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth.\r\n\r\nGyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor\r\nfellow, he had not a great range of expression.\r\n\r\nThe basket was the one which on workdays held Adam\xe2\x80\x99s and Seth\xe2\x80\x99s dinner;\r\nand no official, walking in procession, could look more resolutely\r\nunconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket, trotting at\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s heels.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out, and\r\ncarried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low\r\nhouse, with smooth grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and\r\nmellow in the evening light. The leaded windows were bright and\r\nspeckless, and the door-stone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb\r\ntide. On the door-stone stood a clean old woman, in a dark-striped\r\nlinen gown, a red kerchief, and a linen cap, talking to some speckled\r\nfowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory\r\nexpectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old woman\xe2\x80\x99s sight seemed to\r\nbe dim, for she did not recognize Adam till he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the key,\r\nDolly; lay it down for me in the house, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Mary\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house, and\r\nMester Burge \xe2\x80\x99ull be back anon; he\xe2\x80\x99d be glad t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 ye to supper wi\xe2\x80\x99m,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be\xe2\x80\x99s warrand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Dolly, thank you; I\xe2\x80\x99m off home. Good evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his heels, out of the\r\nworkyard, and along the highroad leading away from the village and down\r\nto the valley. As he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly\r\nhorseman, with his portmanteau strapped behind him, stopped his horse\r\nwhen Adam had passed him, and turned round to have another long look at\r\nthe stalwart workman in paper cap, leather breeches, and dark-blue\r\nworsted stockings.\r\n\r\nAdam, unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck\r\nacross the fields, and now broke out into the tune which had all day\r\nlong been running in his head:\r\n\r\nLet all thy converse be sincere,\r\nThy conscience as the noonday clear;\r\nFor God\xe2\x80\x99s all-seeing eye surveys\r\nThy secret thoughts, thy works and ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nThe Preaching\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement\r\nin the village of Hayslope, and through the whole length of its little\r\nstreet, from the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate, the\r\ninhabitants had evidently been drawn out of their houses by something\r\nmore than the pleasure of lounging in the evening sunshine. The\r\nDonnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the village, and a small\r\nfarmyard and stackyard which flanked it, indicating that there was a\r\npretty take of land attached to the inn, gave the traveller a promise\r\nof good feed for himself and his horse, which might well console him\r\nfor the ignorance in which the weather-beaten sign left him as to the\r\nheraldic bearings of that ancient family, the Donnithornes. Mr. Casson,\r\nthe landlord, had been for some time standing at the door with his\r\nhands in his pockets, balancing himself on his heels and toes and\r\nlooking towards a piece of unenclosed ground, with a maple in the\r\nmiddle of it, which he knew to be the destination of certain\r\ngrave-looking men and women whom he had observed passing at intervals.\r\n\r\nMr. Casson\xe2\x80\x99s person was by no means of that common type which can be\r\nallowed to pass without description. On a front view it appeared to\r\nconsist principally of two spheres, bearing about the same relation to\r\neach other as the earth and the moon: that is to say, the lower sphere\r\nmight be said, at a rough guess, to be thirteen times larger than the\r\nupper which naturally performed the function of a mere satellite and\r\ntributary. But here the resemblance ceased, for Mr. Casson\xe2\x80\x99s head was\r\nnot at all a melancholy-looking satellite nor was it a \xe2\x80\x9cspotty globe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas Milton has irreverently called the moon; on the contrary, no head\r\nand face could look more sleek and healthy, and its expression\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas chiefly confined to a pair of round and ruddy cheeks, the slight\r\nknot and interruptions forming the nose and eyes being scarcely worth\r\nmention\xe2\x80\x94was one of jolly contentment, only tempered by that sense of\r\npersonal dignity which usually made itself felt in his attitude and\r\nbearing. This sense of dignity could hardly be considered excessive in\r\na man who had been butler to \xe2\x80\x9cthe family\xe2\x80\x9d for fifteen years, and who,\r\nin his present high position, was necessarily very much in contact with\r\nhis inferiors. How to reconcile his dignity with the satisfaction of\r\nhis curiosity by walking towards the Green was the problem that Mr.\r\nCasson had been revolving in his mind for the last five minutes; but\r\nwhen he had partly solved it by taking his hands out of his pockets,\r\nand thrusting them into the armholes of his waistcoat, by throwing his\r\nhead on one side, and providing himself with an air of contemptuous\r\nindifference to whatever might fall under his notice, his thoughts were\r\ndiverted by the approach of the horseman whom we lately saw pausing to\r\nhave another look at our friend Adam, and who now pulled up at the door\r\nof the Donnithorne Arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off the bridle and give him a drink, ostler,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller\r\nto the lad in a smock-frock, who had come out of the yard at the sound\r\nof the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s up in your pretty village, landlord?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\ngetting down. \xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be quite a stir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a Methodis\xe2\x80\x99 preaching, sir; it\xe2\x80\x99s been gev hout as a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-going to preach on the Green,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Casson, in a treble and\r\nwheezy voice, with a slightly mincing accent. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to step\r\nin, sir, an\xe2\x80\x99 tek somethink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I must be getting on to Rosseter. I only want a drink for my\r\nhorse. And what does your parson say, I wonder, to a young woman\r\npreaching just under his nose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParson Irwine, sir, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live here; he lives at Brox\xe2\x80\x99on, over the\r\nhill there. The parsonage here\xe2\x80\x99s a tumble-down place, sir, not fit for\r\ngentry to live in. He comes here to preach of a Sunday afternoon, sir,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 puts up his hoss here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a grey cob, sir, an\xe2\x80\x99 he sets great\r\nstore by\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s allays put up his hoss here, sir, iver since before I\r\nhed the Donnithorne Arms. I\xe2\x80\x99m not this countryman, you may tell by my\r\ntongue, sir. They\xe2\x80\x99re cur\xe2\x80\x99ous talkers i\xe2\x80\x99 this country, sir; the gentry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhard work to hunderstand \xe2\x80\x99em. I was brought hup among the gentry, sir,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 got the turn o\xe2\x80\x99 their tongue when I was a bye. Why, what do you\r\nthink the folks here says for \xe2\x80\x98hevn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the gentry, you know, says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98hevn\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94well, the people about here says \xe2\x80\x98hanna yey.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nthey call the dileck as is spoke hereabout, sir. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheared Squire Donnithorne say many a time; it\xe2\x80\x99s the dileck, says he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it very well. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve not got many Methodists about here, surely\xe2\x80\x94in this agricultural\r\nspot? I should have thought there would hardly be such a thing as a\r\nMethodist to be found about here. You\xe2\x80\x99re all farmers, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? The\r\nMethodists can seldom lay much hold on _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty lot o\xe2\x80\x99 workmen round about, sir. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMester Burge as owns the timber-yard over there, he underteks a good\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 building an\xe2\x80\x99 repairs. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s the stone-pits not far off.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of emply i\xe2\x80\x99 this countryside, sir. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s a fine\r\nbatch o\xe2\x80\x99 Methodisses at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the market town about three\r\nmile off\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll maybe ha\xe2\x80\x99 come through it, sir. There\xe2\x80\x99s pretty nigh a\r\nscore of \xe2\x80\x99em on the Green now, as come from there. That\xe2\x80\x99s where our\r\npeople gets it from, though there\xe2\x80\x99s only two men of \xe2\x80\x99em in all\r\nHayslope: that\xe2\x80\x99s Will Maskery, the wheelwright, and Seth Bede, a young\r\nman as works at the carpenterin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe preacher comes from Treddleston, then, does she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, she comes out o\xe2\x80\x99 Stonyshire, pretty nigh thirty mile off.\r\nBut she\xe2\x80\x99s a-visitin\xe2\x80\x99 hereabout at Mester Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s at the Hall Farm\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthem barns an\xe2\x80\x99 big walnut-trees, right away to the left, sir. She\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nniece to Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s wife, an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine an\xe2\x80\x99 vexed at her for making\r\na fool of herself i\xe2\x80\x99 that way. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve heared as there\xe2\x80\x99s no holding\r\nthese Methodisses when the maggit\xe2\x80\x99s once got i\xe2\x80\x99 their head: many of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ngoes stark starin\xe2\x80\x99 mad wi\xe2\x80\x99 their religion. Though this young woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquiet enough to look at, by what I can make out; I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen her\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish I had time to wait and see her, but I must get on. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen out of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look at that\r\nplace in the valley. It\xe2\x80\x99s Squire Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s Donnithorne Chase, that is. Fine hoaks there, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere, sir? I should know what it is, sir, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived butler there\r\na-going i\xe2\x80\x99 fifteen year. It\xe2\x80\x99s Captain Donnithorne as is th\xe2\x80\x99 heir,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x94Squire Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s grandson. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be comin\xe2\x80\x99 of hage this\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ay-\xe2\x80\x99arvest, sir, an\xe2\x80\x99 we shall hev fine doin\xe2\x80\x99s. He owns all the land\r\nabout here, sir, Squire Donnithorne does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty spot, whoever may own it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller,\r\nmounting his horse; \xe2\x80\x9cand one meets some fine strapping fellows about\r\ntoo. I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life, about half\r\nan hour ago, before I came up the hill\xe2\x80\x94a carpenter, a tall,\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes, marching along\r\nlike a soldier. We want such fellows as he to lick the French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Bede, that is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound\xe2\x80\x94Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\neverybody knows him hereabout. He\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon clever stiddy fellow,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 wonderful strong. Lord bless you, sir\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll hexcuse me for\r\nsaying so\xe2\x80\x94he can walk forty mile a-day, an\xe2\x80\x99 lift a matter o\xe2\x80\x99 sixty\r\nston\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon favourite wi\xe2\x80\x99 the gentry, sir: Captain\r\nDonnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wi\xe2\x80\x99 him. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle lifted up an\xe2\x80\x99 peppery-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good evening to you, landlord; I must get on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, sir; good evenin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveller put his horse into a quick walk up the village, but when\r\nhe approached the Green, the beauty of the view that lay on his right\r\nhand, the singular contrast presented by the groups of villagers with\r\nthe knot of Methodists near the maple, and perhaps yet more, curiosity\r\nto see the young female preacher, proved too much for his anxiety to\r\nget to the end of his journey, and he paused.\r\n\r\nThe Green lay at the extremity of the village, and from it the road\r\nbranched off in two directions, one leading farther up the hill by the\r\nchurch, and the other winding gently down towards the valley. On the\r\nside of the Green that led towards the church, the broken line of\r\nthatched cottages was continued nearly to the churchyard gate; but on\r\nthe opposite northwestern side, there was nothing to obstruct the view\r\nof gently swelling meadow, and wooded valley, and dark masses of\r\ndistant hill. That rich undulating district of Loamshire to which\r\nHayslope belonged lies close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire,\r\noverlooked by its barren hills as a pretty blooming sister may\r\nsometimes be seen linked in the arm of a rugged, tall, swarthy brother;\r\nand in two or three hours\xe2\x80\x99 ride the traveller might exchange a bleak\r\ntreeless region, intersected by lines of cold grey stone, for one where\r\nhis road wound under the shelter of woods, or up swelling hills,\r\nmuffled with hedgerows and long meadow-grass and thick corn; and where\r\nat every turn he came upon some fine old country-seat nestled in the\r\nvalley or crowning the slope, some homestead with its long length of\r\nbarn and its cluster of golden ricks, some grey steeple looking out\r\nfrom a pretty confusion of trees and thatch and dark-red tiles. It was\r\njust such a picture as this last that Hayslope Church had made to the\r\ntraveller as he began to mount the gentle slope leading to its pleasant\r\nuplands, and now from his station near the Green he had before him in\r\none view nearly all the other typical features of this pleasant land.\r\nHigh up against the horizon were the huge conical masses of hill, like\r\ngiant mounds intended to fortify this region of corn and grass against\r\nthe keen and hungry winds of the north; not distant enough to be\r\nclothed in purple mystery, but with sombre greenish sides visibly\r\nspecked with sheep, whose motion was only revealed by memory, not\r\ndetected by sight; wooed from day to day by the changing hours, but\r\nresponding with no change in themselves\xe2\x80\x94left for ever grim and sullen\r\nafter the flush of morning, the winged gleams of the April noonday, the\r\nparting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun. And directly below\r\nthem the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging woods, divided\r\nby bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops, and not yet deepened\r\ninto the uniform leafy curtains of high summer, but still showing the\r\nwarm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime.\r\nThen came the valley, where the woods grew thicker, as if they had\r\nrolled down and hurried together from the patches left smooth on the\r\nslope, that they might take the better care of the tall mansion which\r\nlifted its parapets and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them.\r\nDoubtless there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in\r\nfront of that mansion, but the swelling slope of meadow would not let\r\nour traveller see them from the village green. He saw instead a\r\nforeground which was just as lovely\xe2\x80\x94the level sunlight lying like\r\ntransparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass\r\nand the tall red sorrel, and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining\r\nthe bushy hedgerows. It was that moment in summer when the sound of the\r\nscythe being whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the\r\nflower-sprinkled tresses of the meadows.\r\n\r\nHe might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he had turned a\r\nlittle in his saddle and looked eastward, beyond Jonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npasture and woodyard towards the green corn-fields and walnut-trees of\r\nthe Hall Farm; but apparently there was more interest for him in the\r\nliving groups close at hand. Every generation in the village was there,\r\nfrom old \xe2\x80\x9cFeyther Taft\xe2\x80\x9d in his brown worsted night-cap, who was bent\r\nnearly double, but seemed tough enough to keep on his legs a long\r\nwhile, leaning on his short stick, down to the babies with their little\r\nround heads lolling forward in quilted linen caps. Now and then there\r\nwas a new arrival; perhaps a slouching labourer, who, having eaten his\r\nsupper, came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine gaze,\r\nwilling to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it, but by no\r\nmeans excited enough to ask a question. But all took care not to join\r\nthe Methodists on the Green, and identify themselves in that way with\r\nthe expectant audience, for there was not one of them that would not\r\nhave disclaimed the imputation of having come out to hear the \xe2\x80\x9cpreacher\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94they had only come out to see \xe2\x80\x9cwhat war a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 on, like.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmen were chiefly gathered in the neighbourhood of the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop. But do not imagine them gathered in a knot. Villagers never\r\nswarm: a whisper is unknown among them, and they seem almost as\r\nincapable of an undertone as a cow or a stag. Your true rustic turns\r\nhis back on his interlocutor, throwing a question over his shoulder as\r\nif he meant to run away from the answer, and walking a step or two\r\nfarther off when the interest of the dialogue culminates. So the group\r\nin the vicinity of the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s door was by no means a close one,\r\nand formed no screen in front of Chad Cranage, the blacksmith himself,\r\nwho stood with his black brawny arms folded, leaning against the\r\ndoor-post, and occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his own\r\njokes, giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of Wiry Ben,\r\nwho had renounced the pleasures of the Holly Bush for the sake of\r\nseeing life under a new form. But both styles of wit were treated with\r\nequal contempt by Mr. Joshua Rann. Mr. Rann\xe2\x80\x99s leathern apron and\r\nsubdued griminess can leave no one in any doubt that he is the village\r\nshoemaker; the thrusting out of his chin and stomach and the twirling\r\nof his thumbs are more subtle indications, intended to prepare unwary\r\nstrangers for the discovery that they are in the presence of the parish\r\nclerk. \xe2\x80\x9cOld Joshway,\xe2\x80\x9d as he is irreverently called by his neighbours,\r\nis in a state of simmering indignation; but he has not yet opened his\r\nlips except to say, in a resounding bass undertone, like the tuning of\r\na violoncello, \xe2\x80\x9cSehon, King of the Amorites; for His mercy endureth for\r\never; and Og the King of Basan: for His mercy endureth for ever\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nquotation which may seem to have slight bearing on the present\r\noccasion, but, as with every other anomaly, adequate knowledge will\r\nshow it to be a natural sequence. Mr. Rann was inwardly maintaining the\r\ndignity of the Church in the face of this scandalous irruption of\r\nMethodism, and as that dignity was bound up with his own sonorous\r\nutterance of the responses, his argument naturally suggested a\r\nquotation from the psalm he had read the last Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to the edge of\r\nthe Green, where they could examine more closely the Quakerlike costume\r\nand odd deportment of the female Methodists. Underneath the maple there\r\nwas a small cart, which had been brought from the wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nserve as a pulpit, and round this a couple of benches and a few chairs\r\nhad been placed. Some of the Methodists were resting on these, with\r\ntheir eyes closed, as if wrapt in prayer or meditation. Others chose to\r\ncontinue standing, and had turned their faces towards the villagers\r\nwith a look of melancholy compassion, which was highly amusing to Bessy\r\nCranage, the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s buxom daughter, known to her neighbours as\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, who wondered \xe2\x80\x9cwhy the folks war amakin\xe2\x80\x99 faces a that\xe2\x80\x99ns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s Bess was the object of peculiar compassion, because her hair,\r\nbeing turned back under a cap which was set at the top of her head,\r\nexposed to view an ornament of which she was much prouder than of her\r\nred cheeks\xe2\x80\x94namely, a pair of large round ear-rings with false garnets\r\nin them, ornaments condemned not only by the Methodists, but by her own\r\ncousin and namesake Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, who, with much cousinly feeling,\r\noften wished \xe2\x80\x9cthem ear-rings\xe2\x80\x9d might come to good.\r\n\r\nTimothy\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, though retaining her maiden appellation among her\r\nfamiliars, had long been the wife of Sandy Jim, and possessed a\r\nhandsome set of matronly jewels, of which it is enough to mention the\r\nheavy baby she was rocking in her arms, and the sturdy fellow of five\r\nin knee-breeches, and red legs, who had a rusty milk-can round his neck\r\nby way of drum, and was very carefully avoided by Chad\xe2\x80\x99s small terrier.\r\nThis young olive-branch, notorious under the name of Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s Bess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBen, being of an inquiring disposition, unchecked by any false modesty,\r\nhad advanced beyond the group of women and children, and was walking\r\nround the Methodists, looking up in their faces with his mouth wide\r\nopen, and beating his stick against the milk-can by way of musical\r\naccompaniment. But one of the elderly women bending down to take him by\r\nthe shoulder, with an air of grave remonstrance, Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s Bess\xe2\x80\x99s Ben\r\nfirst kicked out vigorously, then took to his heels and sought refuge\r\nbehind his father\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe gallows young dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sandy Jim, with some paternal pride, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nye donna keep that stick quiet, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tek it from ye. What dy\xe2\x80\x99e mane by\r\nkickin\xe2\x80\x99 foulks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Gie him here to me, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad Cranage; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tie hirs up\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 shoe him as I do th\xe2\x80\x99 hosses. Well, Mester Casson,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as\r\nthat personage sauntered up towards the group of men, \xe2\x80\x9chow are ye t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnaight? Are ye coom t\xe2\x80\x99 help groon? They say folks allays groon when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re hearkenin\xe2\x80\x99 to th\xe2\x80\x99 Methodys, as if they war bad i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 inside. I\r\nmane to groon as loud as your cow did th\xe2\x80\x99 other naight, an\xe2\x80\x99 then the\r\npraicher \xe2\x80\x99ull think I\xe2\x80\x99m i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 raight way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d advise you not to be up to no nonsense, Chad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Casson,\r\nwith some dignity; \xe2\x80\x9cPoyser wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear as his wife\xe2\x80\x99s niece\r\nwas treated any ways disrespectful, for all he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be fond of her\r\ntaking on herself to preach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant-looked un too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wiry Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stick\r\nup for the pretty women preachin\xe2\x80\x99; I know they\xe2\x80\x99d persuade me over a\r\ndeal sooner nor th\xe2\x80\x99 ugly men. I shouldna wonder if I turn Methody afore\r\nthe night\xe2\x80\x99s out, an\xe2\x80\x99 begin to coort the preacher, like Seth Bede.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Seth\xe2\x80\x99s looking rether too high, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Casson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman\xe2\x80\x99s kin wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like her to demean herself to a common\r\ncarpenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTchu!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, with a long treble intonation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s folks\xe2\x80\x99s kin\r\ngot to do wi\xe2\x80\x99t? Not a chip. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s wife may turn her nose up an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nforget bygones, but this Dinah Morris, they tell me, \xe2\x80\x99s as poor as iver\r\nshe was\xe2\x80\x94works at a mill, an\xe2\x80\x99s much ado to keep hersen. A strappin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyoung carpenter as is a ready-made Methody, like Seth, wouldna be a bad\r\nmatch for her. Why, Poysers make as big a fuss wi\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Bede as if he\r\nwar a nevvy o\xe2\x80\x99 their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdle talk! idle talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Joshua Rann. \xe2\x80\x9cAdam an\xe2\x80\x99 Seth\xe2\x80\x99s two men;\r\nyou wunna fit them two wi\xe2\x80\x99 the same last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wiry Ben, contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Seth\xe2\x80\x99s the lad for me,\r\nthough he war a Methody twice o\xe2\x80\x99er. I\xe2\x80\x99m fair beat wi\xe2\x80\x99 Seth, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen teasin\xe2\x80\x99 him iver sin\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ve been workin\xe2\x80\x99 together, an\xe2\x80\x99 he bears me\r\nno more malice nor a lamb. An\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s a stout-hearted feller too, for\r\nwhen we saw the old tree all afire a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 across the fields one\r\nnight, an\xe2\x80\x99 we thought as it war a boguy, Seth made no more ado, but he\r\nup to\xe2\x80\x99t as bold as a constable. Why, there he comes out o\xe2\x80\x99 Will\r\nMaskery\xe2\x80\x99s; an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s Will hisself, lookin\xe2\x80\x99 as meek as if he couldna\r\nknock a nail o\xe2\x80\x99 the head for fear o\xe2\x80\x99 hurtin\xe2\x80\x99t. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s the pretty\r\npreacher woman! My eye, she\xe2\x80\x99s got her bonnet off. I mun go a bit\r\nnearer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men followed Ben\xe2\x80\x99s lead, and the traveller pushed his\r\nhorse on to the Green, as Dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of\r\nher companions towards the cart under the maple-tree. While she was\r\nnear Seth\xe2\x80\x99s tall figure, she looked short, but when she had mounted the\r\ncart, and was away from all comparison, she seemed above the middle\r\nheight of woman, though in reality she did not exceed it\xe2\x80\x94an effect\r\nwhich was due to the slimness of her figure and the simple line of her\r\nblack stuff dress. The stranger was struck with surprise as he saw her\r\napproach and mount the cart\xe2\x80\x94surprise, not so much at the feminine\r\ndelicacy of her appearance, as at the total absence of\r\nself-consciousness in her demeanour. He had made up his mind to see her\r\nadvance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of countenance; he\r\nhad felt sure that her face would be mantled with the smile of\r\nconscious saintship, or else charged with denunciatory bitterness. He\r\nknew but two types of Methodist\xe2\x80\x94the ecstatic and the bilious. But Dinah\r\nwalked as simply as if she were going to market, and seemed as\r\nunconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy: there was no\r\nblush, no tremulousness, which said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you think me a pretty\r\nwoman, too young to preach\xe2\x80\x9d; no casting up or down of the eyelids, no\r\ncompression of the lips, no attitude of the arms that said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\nmust think of me as a saint.\xe2\x80\x9d She held no book in her ungloved hands,\r\nbut let them hang down lightly crossed before her, as she stood and\r\nturned her grey eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes;\r\nthey seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they\r\nhad the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to\r\ngive out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her\r\nleft hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her\r\nfrom its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her\r\nface seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was\r\na small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like\r\nline of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and\r\na low perpendicular brow, surmounted by a rising arch of parting\r\nbetween smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight\r\nback behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two above the\r\nbrow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the\r\nhair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes,\r\nthough no darker, were long and abundant\xe2\x80\x94nothing was left blurred or\r\nunfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white\r\nflowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had\r\nno peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple,\r\nso candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer\r\ncould help melting away before their glance. Joshua Rann gave a long\r\ncough, as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new\r\nunderstanding with himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his leather\r\nskull-cap and scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had\r\nthe pluck to think of courting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sweet woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut surely nature never\r\nmeant her for a preacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was one of those who think that nature has theatrical\r\nproperties and, with the considerate view of facilitating art and\r\npsychology, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes up,\xe2\x80\x9d her characters, so that there may be no mistake\r\nabout them. But Dinah began to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a clear but not loud voice \xe2\x80\x9clet us pray for\r\na blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, and hanging her head down a little continued in\r\nthe same moderate tone, as if speaking to some one quite near her:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaviour of sinners! When a poor woman laden with sins, went out to the\r\nwell to draw water, she found Thee sitting at the well. She knew Thee\r\nnot; she had not sought Thee; her mind was dark; her life was unholy.\r\nBut Thou didst speak to her, Thou didst teach her, Thou didst show her\r\nthat her life lay open before Thee, and yet Thou wast ready to give her\r\nthat blessing which she had never sought. Jesus, Thou art in the midst\r\nof us, and Thou knowest all men: if there is any here like that poor\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94if their minds are dark, their lives unholy\xe2\x80\x94if they have come out\r\nnot seeking Thee, not desiring to be taught; deal with them according\r\nto the free mercy which Thou didst show to her. Speak to them, Lord,\r\nopen their ears to my message, bring their sins to their minds, and\r\nmake them thirst for that salvation which Thou art ready to give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Thou art with Thy people still: they see Thee in the\r\nnight-watches, and their hearts burn within them as Thou talkest with\r\nthem by the way. And Thou art near to those who have not known Thee:\r\nopen their eyes that they may see Thee\xe2\x80\x94see Thee weeping over them, and\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x98Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94see Thee\r\nhanging on the cross and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Father, forgive them, for they know\r\nnot what they do\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94see Thee as Thou wilt come again in Thy glory to\r\njudge them at the last. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah opened her eyes again and paused, looking at the group of\r\nvillagers, who were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, raising her voice a little, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have all of\r\nyou been to church, and I think you must have heard the clergyman read\r\nthese words: \xe2\x80\x98The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath\r\nanointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.\xe2\x80\x99 Jesus Christ spoke those\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94he said he came _to preach the Gospel to the poor:_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether you ever thought about those words much, but I will tell you\r\nwhen I remember first hearing them. It was on just such a sort of\r\nevening as this, when I was a little girl, and my aunt as brought me up\r\ntook me to hear a good man preach out of doors, just as we are here. I\r\nremember his face well: he was a very old man, and had very long white\r\nhair; his voice was very soft and beautiful, not like any voice I had\r\never heard before. I was a little girl and scarcely knew anything, and\r\nthis old man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from anybody I\r\nhad ever seen before that I thought he had perhaps come down from the\r\nsky to preach to us, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Aunt, will he go back to the sky\r\nto-night, like the picture in the Bible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man of God was Mr. Wesley, who spent his life in doing what our\r\nblessed Lord did\xe2\x80\x94preaching the Gospel to the poor\xe2\x80\x94and he entered into\r\nhis rest eight years ago. I came to know more about him years after,\r\nbut I was a foolish thoughtless child then, and I remembered only one\r\nthing he told us in his sermon. He told us as \xe2\x80\x98Gospel\xe2\x80\x99 meant \xe2\x80\x98good\r\nnews.\xe2\x80\x99 The Gospel, you know, is what the Bible tells us about God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of that now! Jesus Christ did really come down from heaven, as\r\nI, like a silly child, thought Mr. Wesley did; and what he came down\r\nfor was to tell good news about God to the poor. Why, you and me, dear\r\nfriends, are poor. We have been brought up in poor cottages and have\r\nbeen reared on oat-cake, and lived coarse; and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to\r\nschool much, nor read books, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about anything but\r\nwhat happens just round us. We are just the sort of people that want to\r\nhear good news. For when anybody\xe2\x80\x99s well off, they don\xe2\x80\x99t much mind about\r\nhearing news from distant parts; but if a poor man or woman\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\ntrouble and has hard work to make out a living, they like to have a\r\nletter to tell \xe2\x80\x99em they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a friend as will help \xe2\x80\x99em. To be sure,\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t help knowing something about God, even if we\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard\r\nthe Gospel, the good news that our Saviour brought us. For we know\r\neverything comes from God: don\xe2\x80\x99t you say almost every day, \xe2\x80\x98This and\r\nthat will happen, please God,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98We shall begin to cut the grass\r\nsoon, please God to send us a little more sunshine\xe2\x80\x99? We know very well\r\nwe are altogether in the hands of God. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring ourselves into\r\nthe world, we can\xe2\x80\x99t keep ourselves alive while we\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping; the\r\ndaylight, and the wind, and the corn, and the cows to give us\r\nmilk\xe2\x80\x94everything we have comes from God. And he gave us our souls and\r\nput love between parents and children, and husband and wife. But is\r\nthat as much as we want to know about God? We see he is great and\r\nmighty, and can do what he will: we are lost, as if we was struggling\r\nin great waters, when we try to think of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps doubts come into your mind like this: Can God take much\r\nnotice of us poor people? Perhaps he only made the world for the great\r\nand the wise and the rich. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost him much to give us our\r\nlittle handful of victual and bit of clothing; but how do we know he\r\ncares for us any more than we care for the worms and things in the\r\ngarden, so as we rear our carrots and onions? Will God take care of us\r\nwhen we die? And has he any comfort for us when we are lame and sick\r\nand helpless? Perhaps, too, he is angry with us; else why does the\r\nblight come, and the bad harvests, and the fever, and all sorts of pain\r\nand trouble? For our life is full of trouble, and if God sends us good,\r\nhe seems to send bad too. How is it? How is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear friends, we are in sad want of good news about God; and what\r\ndoes other good news signify if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t that? For everything else\r\ncomes to an end, and when we die we leave it all. But God lasts when\r\neverything else is gone. What shall we do if he is not our friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Dinah told how the good news had been brought, and how the mind of\r\nGod towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of Jesus,\r\ndwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you see, dear friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus spent his time almost\r\nall in doing good to poor people; he preached out of doors to them, and\r\nhe made friends of poor workmen, and taught them and took pains with\r\nthem. Not but what he did good to the rich too, for he was full of love\r\nto all men, only he saw as the poor were more in want of his help. So\r\nhe cured the lame and the sick and the blind, and he worked miracles to\r\nfeed the hungry because, he said, he was sorry for them; and he was\r\nvery kind to the little children and comforted those who had lost their\r\nfriends; and he spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that were sorry for\r\ntheir sins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you love such a man if you saw him\xe2\x80\x94if he were here in\r\nthis village? What a kind heart he must have! What a friend he would be\r\nto go to in trouble! How pleasant it must be to be taught by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear friends, who _was_ this man? Was he only a good man\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\ngood man, and no more\xe2\x80\x94like our dear Mr. Wesley, who has been taken from\r\nus?... He was the Son of God\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98in the image of the Father,\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible\r\nsays; that means, just like God, who is the beginning and end of all\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94the God we want to know about. So then, all the love that Jesus\r\nshowed to the poor is the same love that God has for us. We can\r\nunderstand what Jesus felt, because he came in a body like ours and\r\nspoke words such as we speak to each other. We were afraid to think\r\nwhat God was before\xe2\x80\x94the God who made the world and the sky and the\r\nthunder and lightning. We could never see him; we could only see the\r\nthings he had made; and some of these things was very terrible, so as\r\nwe might well tremble when we thought of him. But our blessed Saviour\r\nhas showed us what God is in a way us poor ignorant people can\r\nunderstand; he has showed us what God\xe2\x80\x99s heart is, what are his feelings\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for.\r\nAnother time he said, \xe2\x80\x98I came to seek and to save that which was lost\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nand another time, \xe2\x80\x98I came not to call the righteous but sinners to\r\nrepentance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _lost!... Sinners!_... Ah, dear friends, does that mean you and\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by\r\nthe charm of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s mellow treble tones, which had a variety of\r\nmodulation like that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious\r\nskill of musical instinct. The simple things she said seemed like\r\nnovelties, as a melody strikes us with a new feeling when we hear it\r\nsung by the pure voice of a boyish chorister; the quiet depth of\r\nconviction with which she spoke seemed in itself an evidence for the\r\ntruth of her message. He saw that she had thoroughly arrested her\r\nhearers. The villagers had pressed nearer to her, and there was no\r\nlonger anything but grave attention on all faces. She spoke slowly,\r\nthough quite fluently, often pausing after a question, or before any\r\ntransition of ideas. There was no change of attitude, no gesture; the\r\neffect of her speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her\r\nvoice, and when she came to the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWill God take care of us\r\nwhen we die?\xe2\x80\x9d she uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that\r\nthe tears came into some of the hardest eyes. The stranger had ceased\r\nto doubt, as he had done at the first glance, that she could fix the\r\nattention of her rougher hearers, but still he wondered whether she\r\ncould have that power of rousing their more violent emotions, which\r\nmust surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a Methodist\r\npreacher, until she came to the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLost!\xe2\x80\x94Sinners!\xe2\x80\x9d when there was\r\na great change in her voice and manner. She had made a long pause\r\nbefore the exclamation, and the pause seemed to be filled by agitating\r\nthoughts that showed themselves in her features. Her pale face became\r\npaler; the circles under her eyes deepened, as they did when tears\r\nhalf-gather without falling; and the mild loving eyes took an\r\nexpression of appalled pity, as if she had suddenly discerned a\r\ndestroying angel hovering over the heads of the people. Her voice\r\nbecame deep and muffled, but there was still no gesture. Nothing could\r\nbe less like the ordinary type of the Ranter than Dinah. She was not\r\npreaching as she heard others preach, but speaking directly from her\r\nown emotions and under the inspiration of her own simple faith.\r\n\r\nBut now she had entered into a new current of feeling. Her manner\r\nbecame less calm, her utterance more rapid and agitated, as she tried\r\nto bring home to the people their guilt, their wilful darkness, their\r\nstate of disobedience to God\xe2\x80\x94as she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin,\r\nthe Divine holiness, and the sufferings of the Saviour, by which a way\r\nhad been opened for their salvation. At last it seemed as if, in her\r\nyearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep, she could not be satisfied\r\nby addressing her hearers as a body. She appealed first to one and then\r\nto another, beseeching them with tears to turn to God while there was\r\nyet time; painting to them the desolation of their souls, lost in sin,\r\nfeeding on the husks of this miserable world, far away from God their\r\nFather; and then the love of the Saviour, who was waiting and watching\r\nfor their return.\r\n\r\nThere was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow-Methodists,\r\nbut the village mind does not easily take fire, and a little\r\nsmouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again was the\r\nutmost effect Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s preaching had wrought in them at present. Yet no\r\none had retired, except the children and \xe2\x80\x9cold Feyther Taft,\xe2\x80\x9d who being\r\ntoo deaf to catch many words, had some time ago gone back to his\r\ninglenook. Wiry Ben was feeling very uncomfortable, and almost wishing\r\nhe had not come to hear Dinah; he thought what she said would haunt him\r\nsomehow. Yet he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help liking to look at her and listen to her,\r\nthough he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and\r\naddress him in particular. She had already addressed Sandy Jim, who was\r\nnow holding the baby to relieve his wife, and the big soft-hearted man\r\nhad rubbed away some tears with his fist, with a confused intention of\r\nbeing a better fellow, going less to the Holly Bush down by the\r\nStone-pits, and cleaning himself more regularly of a Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn front of Sandy Jim stood Chad\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, who had shown an unwonted\r\nquietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak.\r\nNot that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once, for she\r\nwas lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction\r\nthere could be in life to a young woman who wore a cap like Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nGiving up this inquiry in despair, she took to studying Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s nose,\r\neyes, mouth, and hair, and wondering whether it was better to have such\r\na sort of pale face as that, or fat red cheeks and round black eyes\r\nlike her own. But gradually the influence of the general gravity told\r\nupon her, and she became conscious of what Dinah was saying. The gentle\r\ntones, the loving persuasion, did not touch her, but when the more\r\nsevere appeals came she began to be frightened. Poor Bessy had always\r\nbeen considered a naughty girl; she was conscious of it; if it was\r\nnecessary to be very good, it was clear she must be in a bad way. She\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find her places at church as Sally Rann could, she had often\r\nbeen tittering when she \xe2\x80\x9ccurcheyed\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Irwine; and these religious\r\ndeficiencies were accompanied by a corresponding slackness in the minor\r\nmorals, for Bessy belonged unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class\r\nof feminine characters with whom you may venture to \xe2\x80\x9ceat an egg, an\r\napple, or a nut.\xe2\x80\x9d All this she was generally conscious of, and hitherto\r\nhad not been greatly ashamed of it. But now she began to feel very much\r\nas if the constable had come to take her up and carry her before the\r\njustice for some undefined offence. She had a terrified sense that God,\r\nwhom she had always thought of as very far off, was very near to her,\r\nand that Jesus was close by looking at her, though she could not see\r\nhim. For Dinah had that belief in visible manifestations of Jesus,\r\nwhich is common among the Methodists, and she communicated it\r\nirresistibly to her hearers: she made them feel that he was among them\r\nbodily, and might at any moment show himself to them in some way that\r\nwould strike anguish and penitence into their hearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, turning to the left, with her eyes fixed on a\r\npoint above the heads of the people. \xe2\x80\x9cSee where our blessed Lord stands\r\nand weeps and stretches out his arms towards you. Hear what he says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens\r\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\xe2\x80\x99... and ye would not,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated,\r\nin a tone of pleading reproach, turning her eyes on the people again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee the print of the nails on his dear hands and feet. It is your sins\r\nthat made them! Ah! How pale and worn he looks! He has gone through all\r\nthat great agony in the garden, when his soul was exceeding sorrowful\r\neven unto death, and the great drops of sweat fell like blood to the\r\nground. They spat upon him and buffeted him, they scourged him, they\r\nmocked him, they laid the heavy cross on his bruised shoulders. Then\r\nthey nailed him up. Ah, what pain! His lips are parched with thirst,\r\nand they mock him still in this great agony; yet with those parched\r\nlips he prays for them, \xe2\x80\x98Father, forgive them, for they know not what\r\nthey do.\xe2\x80\x99 Then a horror of great darkness fell upon him, and he felt\r\nwhat sinners feel when they are for ever shut out from God. That was\r\nthe last drop in the cup of bitterness. \xe2\x80\x98My God, my God!\xe2\x80\x99 he cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98why hast Thou forsaken me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this he bore for you! For you\xe2\x80\x94and you never think of him; for\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and you turn your backs on him; you don\xe2\x80\x99t care what he has gone\r\nthrough for you. Yet he is not weary of toiling for you: he has risen\r\nfrom the dead, he is praying for you at the right hand of God\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Father,\r\nforgive them, for they know not what they do.\xe2\x80\x99 And he is upon this\r\nearth too; he is among us; he is there close to you now; I see his\r\nwounded body and his look of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Dinah turned to Bessy Cranage, whose bonny youth and evident\r\nvanity had touched her with pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child! Poor child! He is beseeching you, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to\r\nhim. You think of ear-rings and fine gowns and caps, and you never\r\nthink of the Saviour who died to save your precious soul. Your cheeks\r\nwill be shrivelled one day, your hair will be grey, your poor body will\r\nbe thin and tottering! Then you will begin to feel that your soul is\r\nnot saved; then you will have to stand before God dressed in your sins,\r\nin your evil tempers and vain thoughts. And Jesus, who stands ready to\r\nhelp you now, won\xe2\x80\x99t help you then; because you won\xe2\x80\x99t have him to be\r\nyour Saviour, he will be your judge. Now he looks at you with love and\r\nmercy and says, \xe2\x80\x98Come to me that you may have life\xe2\x80\x99; then he will turn\r\naway from you, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Depart from me into ever-lasting fire!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s wide-open black eyes began to fill with tears, her great\r\nred cheeks and lips became quite pale, and her face was distorted like\r\na little child\xe2\x80\x99s before a burst of crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor blind child!\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthink if it should happen to\r\nyou as it once happened to a servant of God in the days of her vanity.\r\n_She_ thought of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy \xe2\x80\x99em; she\r\nthought nothing about how she might get a clean heart and a right\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94she only wanted to have better lace than other girls. And one\r\nday when she put her new cap on and looked in the glass, she saw a\r\nbleeding Face crowned with thorns. That face is looking at you\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Dinah pointed to a spot close in front of Bessy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, tear off\r\nthose follies! Cast them away from you, as if they were stinging\r\nadders. They _are_ stinging you\xe2\x80\x94they are poisoning your soul\xe2\x80\x94they are\r\ndragging you down into a dark bottomless pit, where you will sink for\r\never, and for ever, and for ever, further away from light and God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessy could bear it no longer: a great terror was upon her, and\r\nwrenching her ear-rings from her ears, she threw them down before her,\r\nsobbing aloud. Her father, Chad, frightened lest he should be \xe2\x80\x9claid\r\nhold on\xe2\x80\x9d too, this impression on the rebellious Bess striking him as\r\nnothing less than a miracle, walked hastily away and began to work at\r\nhis anvil by way of reassuring himself. \xe2\x80\x9cFolks mun ha\xe2\x80\x99 hoss-shoes,\r\npraichin\xe2\x80\x99 or no praichin\xe2\x80\x99: the divil canna lay hould o\xe2\x80\x99 me for that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nBut now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for the\r\npenitent, and to describe in her simple way the divine peace and love\r\nwith which the soul of the believer is filled\xe2\x80\x94how the sense of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove turns poverty into riches and satisfies the soul so that no uneasy\r\ndesire vexes it, no fear alarms it: how, at last, the very temptation\r\nto sin is extinguished, and heaven is begun upon earth, because no\r\ncloud passes between the soul and God, who is its eternal sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbrothers and sisters, whom I love as\r\nthose for whom my Lord has died, believe me, I know what this great\r\nblessedness is; and because I know it, I want you to have it too. I am\r\npoor, like you: I have to get my living with my hands; but no lord nor\r\nlady can be so happy as me, if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the love of God in\r\ntheir souls. Think what it is\xe2\x80\x94not to hate anything but sin; to be full\r\nof love to every creature; to be frightened at nothing; to be sure that\r\nall things will turn to good; not to mind pain, because it is our\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s will; to know that nothing\xe2\x80\x94no, not if the earth was to be\r\nburnt up, or the waters come and drown us\xe2\x80\x94nothing could part us from\r\nGod who loves us, and who fills our souls with peace and joy, because\r\nwe are sure that whatever he wills is holy, just, and good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friends, come and take this blessedness; it is offered to you; it\r\nis the good news that Jesus came to preach to the poor. It is not like\r\nthe riches of this world, so that the more one gets the less the rest\r\ncan have. God is without end; his love is without end\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIts streams the whole creation reach,\r\n    So plenteous is the store;\r\nEnough for all, enough for each,\r\n    Enough for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\nDinah had been speaking at least an hour, and the reddening light of\r\nthe parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words.\r\nThe stranger, who had been interested in the course of her sermon as if\r\nit had been the development of a drama\xe2\x80\x94for there is this sort of\r\nfascination in all sincere unpremeditated eloquence, which opens to one\r\nthe inward drama of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s emotions\xe2\x80\x94now turned his horse aside\r\nand pursued his way, while Dinah said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us sing a little, dear\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x9d; and as he was still winding down the slope, the voices of the\r\nMethodists reached him, rising and falling in that strange blending of\r\nexultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nAfter the Preaching\r\n\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour from that time, Seth Bede was walking by Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside along the hedgerow-path that skirted the pastures and green\r\ncorn-fields which lay between the village and the Hall Farm. Dinah had\r\ntaken off her little Quaker bonnet again, and was holding it in her\r\nhands that she might have a freer enjoyment of the cool evening\r\ntwilight, and Seth could see the expression of her face quite clearly\r\nas he walked by her side, timidly revolving something he wanted to say\r\nto her. It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nabsorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment\r\nor with her own personality\xe2\x80\x94an expression that is most of all\r\ndiscouraging to a lover. Her very walk was discouraging: it had that\r\nquiet elasticity that asks for no support. Seth felt this dimly; he\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s too good and holy for any man, let alone me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had\r\nreached his lips. But another thought gave him courage: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no man\r\ncould love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey had been silent for many minutes now, since they had done talking\r\nabout Bessy Cranage; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence, and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of\r\ntheir being only a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the yard-gates of the Hall\r\nFarm at last gave Seth courage to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield o\xe2\x80\x99 Saturday,\r\nDinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m called there. It was borne in upon my\r\nmind while I was meditating on Sunday night, as Sister Allen, who\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\na decline, is in need of me. I saw her as plain as we see that bit of\r\nthin white cloud, lifting up her poor thin hand and beckoning to me.\r\nAnd this morning when I opened the Bible for direction, the first words\r\nmy eyes fell on were, \xe2\x80\x98And after we had seen the vision, immediately we\r\nendeavoured to go into Macedonia.\xe2\x80\x99 If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that clear showing\r\nof the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s will, I should be loath to go, for my heart yearns over\r\nmy aunt and her little ones, and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been much drawn out in prayer for her of late, and I look on it as\r\na token that there may be mercy in store for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cFor I doubt Adam\xe2\x80\x99s heart is so set on her,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll never turn to anybody else; and yet it \xe2\x80\x99ud go to my heart if he\r\nwas to marry her, for I canna think as she\xe2\x80\x99d make him happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndeep mystery\xe2\x80\x94the way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the\r\nrest he\xe2\x80\x99s seen i\xe2\x80\x99 the world, and makes it easier for him to work seven\r\nyear for _her_, like Jacob did for Rachel, sooner than have any other\r\nwoman for th\xe2\x80\x99 asking. I often think of them words, \xe2\x80\x98And Jacob served\r\nseven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days for the\r\nlove he had to her.\xe2\x80\x99 I know those words \xe2\x80\x99ud come true with me, Dinah,\r\nif so be you\xe2\x80\x99d give me hope as I might win you after seven years was\r\nover. I know you think a husband \xe2\x80\x99ud be taking up too much o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nthoughts, because St. Paul says, \xe2\x80\x98She that\xe2\x80\x99s married careth for the\r\nthings of the world how she may please her husband\xe2\x80\x99; and may happen\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll think me overbold to speak to you about it again, after what you\r\ntold me o\xe2\x80\x99 your mind last Saturday. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking it over\r\nagain by night and by day, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve prayed not to be blinded by my own\r\ndesires, to think what\xe2\x80\x99s only good for me must be good for you too. And\r\nit seems to me there\xe2\x80\x99s more texts for your marrying than ever you can\r\nfind against it. For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house,\r\ngive none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully\xe2\x80\x99; and then\r\n\xe2\x80\x98two are better than one\xe2\x80\x99; and that holds good with marriage as well as\r\nwith other things. For we should be o\xe2\x80\x99 one heart and o\xe2\x80\x99 one mind,\r\nDinah. We both serve the same Master, and are striving after the same\r\ngifts; and I\xe2\x80\x99d never be the husband to make a claim on you as could\r\ninterfere with your doing the work God has fitted you for. I\xe2\x80\x99d make a\r\nshift, and fend indoor and out, to give you more liberty\xe2\x80\x94more than you\r\ncan have now, for you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get your own living now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m strong\r\nenough to work for us both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Seth had once begun to urge his suit, he went on earnestly and\r\nalmost hurriedly, lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he\r\nhad poured forth all the arguments he had prepared. His cheeks became\r\nflushed as he went on, his mild grey eyes filled with tears, and his\r\nvoice trembled as he spoke the last sentence. They had reached one of\r\nthose very narrow passes between two tall stones, which performed the\r\noffice of a stile in Loamshire, and Dinah paused as she turned towards\r\nSeth and said, in her tender but calm treble notes, \xe2\x80\x9cSeth Bede, I thank\r\nyou for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more\r\nthan a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my heart is not\r\nfree to marry. That is good for other women, and it is a great and a\r\nblessed thing to be a wife and mother; but \xe2\x80\x98as God has distributed to\r\nevery man, as the Lord hath called every man, so let him walk.\xe2\x80\x99 God has\r\ncalled me to minister to others, not to have any joys or sorrows of my\r\nown, but to rejoice with them that do rejoice, and to weep with those\r\nthat weep. He has called me to speak his word, and he has greatly owned\r\nmy work. It could only be on a very clear showing that I could leave\r\nthe brethren and sisters at Snowfield, who are favoured with very\r\nlittle of this world\xe2\x80\x99s good; where the trees are few, so that a child\r\nmight count them, and there\xe2\x80\x99s very hard living for the poor in the\r\nwinter. It has been given me to help, to comfort, and strengthen the\r\nlittle flock there and to call in many wanderers; and my soul is filled\r\nwith these things from my rising up till my lying down. My life is too\r\nshort, and God\xe2\x80\x99s work is too great for me to think of making a home for\r\nmyself in this world. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth,\r\nfor when I saw as your love was given to me, I thought it might be a\r\nleading of Providence for me to change my way of life, and that we\r\nshould be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter before the Lord. But\r\nwhenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our living together,\r\nother thoughts always came in\xe2\x80\x94the times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve prayed by the sick\r\nand dying, and the happy hours I\xe2\x80\x99ve had preaching, when my heart was\r\nfilled with love, and the Word was given to me abundantly. And when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve opened the Bible for direction, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always lighted on some clear\r\nword to tell me where my work lay. I believe what you say, Seth, that\r\nyou would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see\r\nthat our marriage is not God\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94He draws my heart another way. I\r\ndesire to live and die without husband or children. I seem to have no\r\nroom in my soul for wants and fears of my own, it has pleased God to\r\nfill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence. At last, as\r\nthey were nearly at the yard-gate, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dinah, I must seek\r\nfor strength to bear it, and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible.\r\nBut I feel now how weak my faith is. It seems as if, when you are gone,\r\nI could never joy in anything any more. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something passing\r\nthe love of women as I feel for you, for I could be content without\r\nyour marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you. I\r\ntrusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading\r\nfor us both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial. Perhaps I\r\nfeel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I often\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help saying of you what the hymn says\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIn darkest shades if she appear,\r\n    My dawning is begun;\r\nShe is my soul\xe2\x80\x99s bright morning-star,\r\n    And she my rising sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat may be wrong, and I am to be taught better. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndispleased with me if things turned out so as I could leave this\r\ncountry and go to live at Snowfield?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Seth; but I counsel you to wait patiently, and not lightly to\r\nleave your own country and kindred. Do nothing without the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s clear\r\nbidding. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bleak and barren country there, not like this land of\r\nGoshen you\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry to fix and choose\r\nour own lot; we must wait to be guided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99d let me write you a letter, Dinah, if there was anything I\r\nwanted to tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sure; let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99re in any trouble. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be continually\r\nin my prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the yard-gate, and Seth said, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go in,\r\nDinah, so farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused and hesitated after she had given him\r\nher hand, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing but what you may see\r\nthings different after a while. There may be a new leading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us leave that, Seth. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to live only a moment at a time, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve read in one of Mr. Wesley\xe2\x80\x99s books. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t for you and me to lay\r\nplans; we\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to do but to obey and to trust. Farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes, and\r\nthen passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to walk\r\nlingeringly home. But instead of taking the direct road, he chose to\r\nturn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already\r\npassed; and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears\r\nlong before he had made up his mind that it was time for him to set his\r\nface steadily homewards. He was but three-and-twenty, and had only just\r\nlearned what it is to love\xe2\x80\x94to love with that adoration which a young\r\nman gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than\r\nhimself. Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from religious\r\nfeeling. What deep and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child, or\r\nart or music. Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under\r\nthe influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic\r\nstatues, or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness\r\nthat they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love\r\nand beauty; our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression\r\ninto silence, our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object\r\nand loses itself in the sense of divine mystery. And this blessed gift\r\nof venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since\r\nthe world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed\r\nin the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago, while there\r\nwas yet a lingering after-glow from the time when Wesley and his\r\nfellow-labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after\r\nexhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor.\r\n\r\nThat afterglow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt to make\r\nof Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills,\r\nor the deep shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where a crowd of rough men\r\nand weary-hearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary\r\nculture, which linked their thoughts with the past, lifted their\r\nimagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives, and\r\nsuffused their souls with the sense of a pitying, loving, infinite\r\nPresence, sweet as summer to the houseless needy. It is too possible\r\nthat to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than\r\nlow-pitched gables up dingy streets, sleek grocers, sponging preachers,\r\nand hypocritical jargon\xe2\x80\x94elements which are regarded as an exhaustive\r\nanalysis of Methodism in many fashionable quarters.\r\n\r\nThat would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were\r\nanything else than Methodists\xe2\x80\x94not indeed of that modern type which\r\nreads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes,\r\nbut of a very old-fashioned kind. They believed in present miracles, in\r\ninstantaneous conversions, in revelations by dreams and visions; they\r\ndrew lots, and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at\r\nhazard; having a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures, which is\r\nnot at all sanctioned by approved commentators; and it is impossible\r\nfor me to represent their diction as correct, or their instruction as\r\nliberal. Still\xe2\x80\x94if I have read religious history aright\xe2\x80\x94faith, hope, and\r\ncharity have not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility\r\nto the three concords, and it is possible\xe2\x80\x94thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x94to have very\r\nerroneous theories and very sublime feelings. The raw bacon which\r\nclumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it to\r\nher neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s child to \xe2\x80\x9cstop the fits,\xe2\x80\x9d may be a piteously\r\ninefficacious remedy; but the generous stirring of neighbourly kindness\r\nthat prompted the deed has a beneficent radiation that is not lost.\r\n\r\nConsidering these things, we can hardly think Dinah and Seth beneath\r\nour sympathy, accustomed as we may be to weep over the loftier sorrows\r\nof heroines in satin boots and crinoline, and of heroes riding fiery\r\nhorses, themselves ridden by still more fiery passions.\r\n\r\nPoor Seth! He was never on horseback in his life except once, when he\r\nwas a little lad, and Mr. Jonathan Burge took him up behind, telling\r\nhim to \xe2\x80\x9chold on tight\xe2\x80\x9d; and instead of bursting out into wild accusing\r\napostrophes to God and destiny, he is resolving, as he now walks\r\nhomewards under the solemn starlight, to repress his sadness, to be\r\nless bent on having his own will, and to live more for others, as Dinah\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nHome and Its Sorrows\r\n\r\n\r\nA green valley with a brook running through it, full almost to\r\noverflowing with the late rains, overhung by low stooping willows.\r\nAcross this brook a plank is thrown, and over this plank Adam Bede is\r\npassing with his undoubting step, followed close by Gyp with the\r\nbasket; evidently making his way to the thatched house, with a stack of\r\ntimber by the side of it, about twenty yards up the opposite slope.\r\n\r\nThe door of the house is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but\r\nshe is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been\r\nwatching with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last\r\nfew minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth\r\nBede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has\r\ncome late in life. She is an anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman,\r\nclean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure\r\nlinen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is covered with a\r\nbuff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made\r\nof blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the\r\nhips, from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey\r\npetticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a\r\nstrong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are\r\nsomewhat dim now\xe2\x80\x94perhaps from too much crying\xe2\x80\x94but her broadly marked\r\neyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as she stands\r\nknitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened hands, she\r\nhas as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of\r\nwater on her head from the spring. There is the same type of frame and\r\nthe same keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not\r\nfrom her that Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of\r\nlarge-hearted intelligence.\r\n\r\nFamily likeness has often a deep sadness in it. Nature, that great\r\ntragic dramatist, knits us together by bone and muscle, and divides us\r\nby the subtler web of our brains; blends yearning and repulsion; and\r\nties us by our heart-strings to the beings that jar us at every\r\nmovement. We hear a voice with the very cadence of our own uttering the\r\nthoughts we despise; we see eyes\xe2\x80\x94ah, so like our mother\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x94averted from\r\nus in cold alienation; and our last darling child startles us with the\r\nair and gestures of the sister we parted from in bitterness long years\r\nago. The father to whom we owe our best heritage\xe2\x80\x94the mechanical\r\ninstinct, the keen sensibility to harmony, the unconscious skill of the\r\nmodelling hand\xe2\x80\x94galls us and puts us to shame by his daily errors; the\r\nlong-lost mother, whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own\r\nwrinkles come, once fretted our young souls with her anxious humours\r\nand irrational persistence.\r\n\r\nIt is such a fond anxious mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice that you hear, as Lisbeth\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone seven by th\xe2\x80\x99 clock. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t allays stay\r\ntill the last child\xe2\x80\x99s born. Thee wants thy supper, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrand.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Seth? Gone arter some o\xe2\x80\x99s chapellin\xe2\x80\x99, I reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, Seth\xe2\x80\x99s at no harm, mother, thee mayst be sure. But where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam quickly, as he entered the house and glanced into\r\nthe room on the left hand, which was used as a workshop. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ndone the coffin for Tholer? There\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff standing just as I left\r\nit this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone the coffin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, following him, and knitting\r\nuninterruptedly, though she looked at her son very anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, my\r\nlad, he went aff to Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on this forenoon, an\xe2\x80\x99s niver come back. I\r\ndoubt he\xe2\x80\x99s got to th\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Waggin Overthrow\xe2\x80\x99 again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face. He said nothing,\r\nbut threw off his jacket and began to roll up his shirt-sleeves again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, with a tone and look of\r\nalarm. \xe2\x80\x9cThee wouldstna go to work again, wi\xe2\x80\x99out ha\xe2\x80\x99in thy bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsupper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, too angry to speak, walked into the workshop. But his mother\r\nthrew down her knitting, and, hurrying after him, took hold of his arm,\r\nand said, in a tone of plaintive remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lad, my lad,\r\nthee munna go wi\xe2\x80\x99out thy supper; there\xe2\x80\x99s the taters wi\xe2\x80\x99 the gravy in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, just as thee lik\xe2\x80\x99st \xe2\x80\x99em. I saved \xe2\x80\x99em o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for thee. Come an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 thy supper, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam impetuously, shaking her off and seizing one of the\r\nplanks that stood against the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking about having\r\nsupper when here\xe2\x80\x99s a coffin promised to be ready at Brox\xe2\x80\x99on by seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow morning, and ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 been there now, and not a\r\nnail struck yet. My throat\xe2\x80\x99s too full to swallow victuals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee canstna get the coffin ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth. \xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99t work\r\nthyself to death. It \xe2\x80\x99ud take thee all night to do\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat signifies how long it takes me? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the coffin promised? Can\r\nthey bury the man without a coffin? I\xe2\x80\x99d work my right hand off sooner\r\nthan deceive people with lies i\xe2\x80\x99 that way. It makes me mad to think\r\non\xe2\x80\x99t. I shall overrun these doings before long. I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood enough of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Lisbeth did not hear this threat for the first time, and if she\r\nhad been wise she would have gone away quietly and said nothing for the\r\nnext hour. But one of the lessons a woman most rarely learns is never\r\nto talk to an angry or a drunken man. Lisbeth sat down on the chopping\r\nbench and began to cry, and by the time she had cried enough to make\r\nher voice very piteous, she burst out into words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away an\xe2\x80\x99 break thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, an\xe2\x80\x99 leave thy feyther to ruin. Thee wouldstna ha\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em carry me\r\nto th\xe2\x80\x99 churchyard, an\xe2\x80\x99 thee not to follow me. I shanna rest i\xe2\x80\x99 my grave\r\nif I donna see thee at th\xe2\x80\x99 last; an\xe2\x80\x99 how\xe2\x80\x99s they to let thee know as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-dyin\xe2\x80\x99, if thee\xe2\x80\x99t gone a-workin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 distant parts, an\xe2\x80\x99 Seth belike\r\ngone arter thee, and thy feyther not able to hold a pen for\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nshakin\xe2\x80\x99, besides not knowin\xe2\x80\x99 where thee art? Thee mun forgie thy\r\nfeyther\xe2\x80\x94thee munna be so bitter again\xe2\x80\x99 him. He war a good feyther to\r\nthee afore he took to th\xe2\x80\x99 drink. He\xe2\x80\x99s a clever workman, an\xe2\x80\x99 taught thee\r\nthy trade, remember, an\xe2\x80\x99s niver gen me a blow nor so much as an ill\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94no, not even in \xe2\x80\x99s drink. Thee wouldstna ha\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99m go to the\r\nworkhus\xe2\x80\x94thy own feyther\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 him as was a fine-growed man an\xe2\x80\x99 handy at\r\neverythin\xe2\x80\x99 amost as thee art thysen, five-an\xe2\x80\x99-twenty \xe2\x80\x99ear ago, when\r\nthee wast a baby at the breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s voice became louder, and choked with sobs\xe2\x80\x94a sort of wail, the\r\nmost irritating of all sounds where real sorrows are to be borne and\r\nreal work to be done. Adam broke in impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mother, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry and talk so. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I got enough to vex me\r\nwithout that? What\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 use o\xe2\x80\x99 telling me things as I only think too\r\nmuch on every day? If I didna think on \xe2\x80\x99em, why should I do as I do,\r\nfor the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 keeping things together here? But I hate to be talking\r\nwhere it\xe2\x80\x99s no use: I like to keep my breath for doing i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntalking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know thee dost things as nobody else \xe2\x80\x99ud do, my lad. But thee\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallays so hard upo\xe2\x80\x99 thy feyther, Adam. Thee think\xe2\x80\x99st nothing too much\r\nto do for Seth: thee snapp\xe2\x80\x99st me up if iver I find faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 lad.\r\nBut thee\xe2\x80\x99t so angered wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy feyther, more nor wi\xe2\x80\x99 anybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better than speaking soft and letting things go the wrong way,\r\nI reckon, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sharp with him he\xe2\x80\x99d sell every bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstuff i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 yard and spend it on drink. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a duty to be\r\ndone by my father, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my duty to encourage him in running\r\nheadlong to ruin. And what has Seth got to do with it? The lad does no\r\nharm as I know of. But leave me alone, Mother, and let me get on with\r\nthe work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth dared not say any more; but she got up and called Gyp, thinking\r\nto console herself somewhat for Adam\xe2\x80\x99s refusal of the supper she had\r\nspread out in the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it,\r\nby feeding Adam\xe2\x80\x99s dog with extra liberality. But Gyp was watching his\r\nmaster with wrinkled brow and ears erect, puzzled at this unusual\r\ncourse of things; and though he glanced at Lisbeth when she called him,\r\nand moved his fore-paws uneasily, well knowing that she was inviting\r\nhim to supper, he was in a divided state of mind, and remained seated\r\non his haunches, again fixing his eyes anxiously on his master. Adam\r\nnoticed Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s mental conflict, and though his anger had made him less\r\ntender than usual to his mother, it did not prevent him from caring as\r\nmuch as usual for his dog. We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that\r\nlove us than to the women that love us. Is it because the brutes are\r\ndumb?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Gyp; go, lad!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, in a tone of encouraging command; and\r\nGyp, apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one, followed\r\nLisbeth into the house-place.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had he licked up his supper than he went back to his\r\nmaster, while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her knitting. Women\r\nwho are never bitter and resentful are often the most querulous; and if\r\nSolomon was as wise as he is reputed to be, I feel sure that when he\r\ncompared a contentious woman to a continual dropping on a very rainy\r\nday, he had not a vixen in his eye\xe2\x80\x94a fury with long nails, acrid and\r\nselfish. Depend upon it, he meant a good creature, who had no joy but\r\nin the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make\r\nuncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and spending\r\nnothing on herself. Such a woman as Lisbeth, for example\xe2\x80\x94at once\r\npatient and complaining, self-renouncing and exacting, brooding the\r\nlivelong day over what happened yesterday and what is likely to happen\r\nto-morrow, and crying very readily both at the good and the evil. But a\r\ncertain awe mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam, and when\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she was always silenced.\r\n\r\nSo the hours passed, to the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the\r\nsound of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s tools. At last he called for a light and a draught of\r\nwater (beer was a thing only to be drunk on holidays), and Lisbeth\r\nventured to say as she took it in, \xe2\x80\x9cThy supper stan\xe2\x80\x99s ready for thee,\r\nwhen thee lik\xe2\x80\x99st.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonna thee sit up, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, in a gentle tone. He had worked\r\noff his anger now, and whenever he wished to be especially kind to his\r\nmother, he fell into his strongest native accent and dialect, with\r\nwhich at other times his speech was less deeply tinged. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see to\r\nFather when he comes home; maybe he wonna come at all to-night. I shall\r\nbe easier if thee\xe2\x80\x99t i\xe2\x80\x99 bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bide till Seth comes. He wonna be long now, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then past nine by the clock, which was always in advance of the\r\ndays, and before it had struck ten the latch was lifted and Seth\r\nentered. He had heard the sound of the tools as he was approaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow is it as Father\xe2\x80\x99s working so late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s none o\xe2\x80\x99 thy feyther as is a-workin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94thee might know that well\r\nanoof if thy head warna full o\xe2\x80\x99 chapellin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s thy brother as does\r\niverything, for there\xe2\x80\x99s niver nobody else i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 way to do nothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth was going on, for she was not at all afraid of Seth, and\r\nusually poured into his ears all the querulousness which was repressed\r\nby her awe of Adam. Seth had never in his life spoken a harsh word to\r\nhis mother, and timid people always wreak their peevishness on the\r\ngentle. But Seth, with an anxious look, had passed into the workshop\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cAddy, how\xe2\x80\x99s this? What! Father\xe2\x80\x99s forgot the coffin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, lad, th\xe2\x80\x99 old tale; but I shall get it done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking\r\nup and casting one of his bright keen glances at his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with thee? Thee\xe2\x80\x99t in trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were red, and there was a look of deep depression on his\r\nmild face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Addy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what must be borne, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped. Why,\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99st never been to the school, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchool? No, that screw can wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, hammering away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take my turn now, and do thee go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lad, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go on, now I\xe2\x80\x99m in harness. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t help me to carry\r\nit to Brox\xe2\x80\x99on when it\xe2\x80\x99s done. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call thee up at sunrise. Go and eat\r\nthy supper, and shut the door so as I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Mother\xe2\x80\x99s talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth knew that Adam always meant what he said, and was not to be\r\npersuaded into meaning anything else. So he turned, with rather a heavy\r\nheart, into the house-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x99s niver touched a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 victual sin\xe2\x80\x99 home he\xe2\x80\x99s come,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLisbeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon thee\xe2\x80\x99st hed thy supper at some o\xe2\x80\x99 thy Methody\r\nfolks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had no supper yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, \xe2\x80\x9cbut donna thee ate the taters, for Adam\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull happen ate \xe2\x80\x99em if I leave \xe2\x80\x99em stannin\xe2\x80\x99. He loves a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 taters\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 gravy. But he\xe2\x80\x99s been so sore an\xe2\x80\x99 angered, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ate \xe2\x80\x99em, for\r\nall I\xe2\x80\x99d putten \xe2\x80\x99em by o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for him. An\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s been a-threatenin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto go away again,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, whimpering, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m fast sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nsome dawnin\xe2\x80\x99 afore I\xe2\x80\x99m up, an\xe2\x80\x99 niver let me know aforehand, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nniver come back again when once he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d better niver ha\xe2\x80\x99 had\r\na son, as is like no other body\xe2\x80\x99s son for the deftness an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhandiness, an\xe2\x80\x99 so looked on by th\xe2\x80\x99 grit folks, an\xe2\x80\x99 tall an\xe2\x80\x99 upright\r\nlike a poplar-tree, an\xe2\x80\x99 me to be parted from him an\xe2\x80\x99 niver see \xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mother, donna grieve thyself in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, in a soothing\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99st not half so good reason to think as Adam \xe2\x80\x99ull go away\r\nas to think he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with thee. He may say such a thing when he\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nwrath\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99s got excuse for being wrathful sometimes\xe2\x80\x94but his heart\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud never let him go. Think how he\xe2\x80\x99s stood by us all when it\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nnone so easy\xe2\x80\x94paying his savings to free me from going for a soldier,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 turnin\xe2\x80\x99 his earnin\xe2\x80\x99s into wood for father, when he\xe2\x80\x99s got plenty o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuses for his money, and many a young man like him \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been married\r\nand settled before now. He\xe2\x80\x99ll never turn round and knock down his own\r\nwork, and forsake them as it\xe2\x80\x99s been the labour of his life to stand\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonna talk to me about\xe2\x80\x99s marr\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, crying afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nset\xe2\x80\x99s heart on that Hetty Sorrel, as \xe2\x80\x99ull niver save a penny, an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ull\r\ntoss up her head at\xe2\x80\x99s old mother. An\xe2\x80\x99 to think as he might ha\xe2\x80\x99 Mary\r\nBurge, an\xe2\x80\x99 be took partners, an\xe2\x80\x99 be a big man wi\xe2\x80\x99 workmen under him,\r\nlike Mester Burge\xe2\x80\x94Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s told me so o\xe2\x80\x99er and o\xe2\x80\x99er again\xe2\x80\x94if it warna as\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s set\xe2\x80\x99s heart on that bit of a wench, as is o\xe2\x80\x99 no more use nor the\r\ngillyflower on the wall. An\xe2\x80\x99 he so wise at bookin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 figurin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnot to know no better nor that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mother, thee know\xe2\x80\x99st we canna love just where other folks \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nhave us. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody but God can control the heart of man. I could\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 wished myself as Adam could ha\xe2\x80\x99 made another choice, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreproach him for what he can\xe2\x80\x99t help. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure but what he tries\r\nto o\xe2\x80\x99ercome it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter as he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be spoke to\r\nabout, and I can only pray to the Lord to bless and direct him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, thee\xe2\x80\x99t allays ready enough at prayin\xe2\x80\x99, but I donna see as thee\r\ngets much wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy prayin\xe2\x80\x99. Thee wotna get double earnin\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99 this side\r\nYule. Th\xe2\x80\x99 Methodies \xe2\x80\x99ll niver make thee half the man thy brother is,\r\nfor all they\xe2\x80\x99re a-makin\xe2\x80\x99 a preacher on thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s partly truth thee speak\xe2\x80\x99st there, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, mildly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x99s far before me, an\xe2\x80\x99s done more for me than I can ever do for\r\nhim. God distributes talents to every man according as He sees good.\r\nBut thee mustna undervally prayer. Prayer mayna bring money, but it\r\nbrings us what no money can buy\xe2\x80\x94a power to keep from sin and be content\r\nwith God\xe2\x80\x99s will, whatever He may please to send. If thee wouldst pray\r\nto God to help thee, and trust in His goodness, thee wouldstna be so\r\nuneasy about things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnaisy? I\xe2\x80\x99m i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 right on\xe2\x80\x99t to be unaisy. It\xe2\x80\x99s well seen on _thee_\r\nwhat it is niver to be unaisy. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t gi\xe2\x80\x99 away all thy earnin\xe2\x80\x99s, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nniver be unaisy as thee\xe2\x80\x99st nothin\xe2\x80\x99 laid up again\xe2\x80\x99 a rainy day. If Adam\r\nhad been as aisy as thee, he\xe2\x80\x99d niver ha\xe2\x80\x99 had no money to pay for thee.\r\nTake no thought for the morrow\xe2\x80\x94take no thought\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what thee\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallays sayin\xe2\x80\x99; an\xe2\x80\x99 what comes on\xe2\x80\x99t? Why, as Adam has to take thought\r\nfor thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the words o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nas we should be idle. They mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be overanxious and\r\nworreting ourselves about what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen to-morrow, but do our duty and\r\nleave the rest to God\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee: thee allays makes a peck o\xe2\x80\x99 thy own\r\nwords out o\xe2\x80\x99 a pint o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s. I donna see how thee\xe2\x80\x99t to know as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98take no thought for the morrow\xe2\x80\x99 means all that. An\xe2\x80\x99 when the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuch a big book, an\xe2\x80\x99 thee canst read all thro\xe2\x80\x99t, an\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 the pick o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe texes, I canna think why thee dostna pick better words as donna\r\nmean so much more nor they say. Adam doesna pick a that\xe2\x80\x99n; I can\r\nunderstan\xe2\x80\x99 the tex as he\xe2\x80\x99s allays a-sayin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98God helps them as helps\r\ntheirsens.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s no text o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible. It comes out of\r\na book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on. It was wrote by a\r\nknowing man, but overworldly, I doubt. However, that saying\xe2\x80\x99s partly\r\ntrue; for the Bible tells us we must be workers together with God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how\xe2\x80\x99m I to know? It sounds like a tex. But what\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 matter wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 lad? Thee\xe2\x80\x99t hardly atin\xe2\x80\x99 a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 supper. Dostna mean to ha\xe2\x80\x99 no\r\nmore nor that bit o\xe2\x80\x99 oat-cake? An\xe2\x80\x99 thee lookst as white as a flick o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnew bacon. What\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 matter wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to mind about, Mother; I\xe2\x80\x99m not hungry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just look in at\r\nAdam again, and see if he\xe2\x80\x99ll let me go on with the coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa\xe2\x80\x99 a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 warm broth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, whose motherly feeling now\r\ngot the better of her \xe2\x80\x9cnattering\xe2\x80\x9d habit. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll set two-three sticks\r\na-light in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother, thank thee; thee\xe2\x80\x99t very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, gratefully; and\r\nencouraged by this touch of tenderness, he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me pray a bit\r\nwith thee for Father, and Adam, and all of us\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll comfort thee,\r\nhappen, more than thee thinkst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to say again\xe2\x80\x99 it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth, though disposed always to take the negative side in her\r\nconversations with Seth, had a vague sense that there was some comfort\r\nand safety in the fact of his piety, and that it somehow relieved her\r\nfrom the trouble of any spiritual transactions on her own behalf.\r\n\r\nSo the mother and son knelt down together, and Seth prayed for the poor\r\nwandering father and for those who were sorrowing for him at home. And\r\nwhen he came to the petition that Adam might never be called to set up\r\nhis tent in a far country, but that his mother might be cheered and\r\ncomforted by his presence all the days of her pilgrimage, Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nready tears flowed again, and she wept aloud.\r\n\r\nWhen they rose from their knees, Seth went to Adam again and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilt only lie down for an hour or two, and let me go on the while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Seth, no. Make Mother go to bed, and go thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime Lisbeth had dried her eyes, and now followed Seth, holding\r\nsomething in her hands. It was the brown-and-yellow platter containing\r\nthe baked potatoes with the gravy in them and bits of meat which she\r\nhad cut and mixed among them. Those were dear times, when wheaten bread\r\nand fresh meat were delicacies to working people. She set the dish down\r\nrather timidly on the bench by Adam\xe2\x80\x99s side and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThee canst pick a\r\nbit while thee\xe2\x80\x99t workin\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring thee another drop o\xe2\x80\x99 water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, Mother, do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting very thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn half an hour all was quiet; no sound was to be heard in the house\r\nbut the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the ringing of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntools. The night was very still: when Adam opened the door to look out\r\nat twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the only motion seemed to be in the glowing,\r\ntwinkling stars; every blade of grass was asleep.\r\n\r\nBodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much at the\r\nmercy of our feelings and imagination; and it was so to-night with\r\nAdam. While his muscles were working lustily, his mind seemed as\r\npassive as a spectator at a diorama: scenes of the sad past, and\r\nprobably sad future, floating before him and giving place one to the\r\nother in swift succession.\r\n\r\nHe saw how it would be to-morrow morning, when he had carried the\r\ncoffin to Broxton and was at home again, having his breakfast: his\r\nfather perhaps would come in ashamed to meet his son\xe2\x80\x99s glance\xe2\x80\x94would sit\r\ndown, looking older and more tottering than he had done the morning\r\nbefore, and hang down his head, examining the floor-quarries; while\r\nLisbeth would ask him how he supposed the coffin had been got ready,\r\nthat he had slinked off and left undone\xe2\x80\x94for Lisbeth was always the\r\nfirst to utter the word of reproach, although she cried at Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseverity towards his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it will go on, worsening and worsening,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nslipping uphill again, and no standing still when once you \xe2\x80\x99ve begun to\r\nslip down.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the day came back to him when he was a little\r\nfellow and used to run by his father\xe2\x80\x99s side, proud to be taken out to\r\nwork, and prouder still to hear his father boasting to his\r\nfellow-workmen how \xe2\x80\x9cthe little chap had an uncommon notion o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncarpentering.\xe2\x80\x9d What a fine active fellow his father was then! When\r\npeople asked Adam whose little lad he was, he had a sense of\r\ndistinction as he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x99s lad.\xe2\x80\x9d He was quite sure\r\neverybody knew Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t he make the wonderful pigeon-house at\r\nBroxton parsonage? Those were happy days, especially when Seth, who was\r\nthree years the younger, began to go out working too, and Adam began to\r\nbe a teacher as well as a learner. But then came the days of sadness,\r\nwhen Adam was someway on in his teens, and Thias began to loiter at the\r\npublic-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and to pour forth her\r\nplaints in the hearing of her sons. Adam remembered well the night of\r\nshame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish,\r\nshouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaggon Overthrown.\xe2\x80\x9d He had run away once when he was only eighteen,\r\nmaking his escape in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle\r\nover his shoulder, and his \xe2\x80\x9cmensuration book\xe2\x80\x9d in his pocket, and saying\r\nto himself very decidedly that he could bear the vexations of home no\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94he would go and seek his fortune, setting up his stick at the\r\ncrossways and bending his steps the way it fell. But by the time he got\r\nto Stoniton, the thought of his mother and Seth, left behind to endure\r\neverything without him, became too importunate, and his resolution\r\nfailed him. He came back the next day, but the misery and terror his\r\nmother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said to himself to-night, \xe2\x80\x9cthat must never happen again. It\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last, if my\r\npoor old mother stood o\xe2\x80\x99 the wrong side. My back\xe2\x80\x99s broad enough and\r\nstrong enough; I should be no better than a coward to go away and leave\r\nthe troubles to be borne by them as aren\xe2\x80\x99t half so able. \xe2\x80\x98They that are\r\nstrong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak, and not to\r\nplease themselves.\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s a text wants no candle to show\xe2\x80\x99t; it shines\r\nby its own light. It\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough you get into the wrong road i\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\nlife if you run after this and that only for the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 making things\r\neasy and pleasant to yourself. A pig may poke his nose into the trough\r\nand think o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing outside it; but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart and\r\nsoul in you, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be easy a-making your own bed an\xe2\x80\x99 leaving the\r\nrest to lie on the stones. Nay, nay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never slip my neck out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nyoke, and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns. Father\xe2\x80\x99s a sore\r\ncross to me, an\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be for many a long year to come. What then?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got th\xe2\x80\x99 health, and the limbs, and the sperrit to bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment a smart rap, as if with a willow wand, was given at the\r\nhouse door, and Gyp, instead of barking, as might have been expected,\r\ngave a loud howl. Adam, very much startled, went at once to the door\r\nand opened it. Nothing was there; all was still, as when he opened it\r\nan hour before; the leaves were motionless, and the light of the stars\r\nshowed the placid fields on both sides of the brook quite empty of\r\nvisible life. Adam walked round the house, and still saw nothing except\r\na rat which darted into the woodshed as he passed. He went in again,\r\nwondering; the sound was so peculiar that the moment he heard it it\r\ncalled up the image of the willow wand striking the door. He could not\r\nhelp a little shudder, as he remembered how often his mother had told\r\nhim of just such a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying. Adam\r\nwas not a man to be gratuitously superstitious, but he had the blood of\r\nthe peasant in him as well as of the artisan, and a peasant can no more\r\nhelp believing in a traditional superstition than a horse can help\r\ntrembling when he sees a camel. Besides, he had that mental combination\r\nwhich is at once humble in the region of mystery and keen in the region\r\nof knowledge: it was the depth of his reverence quite as much as his\r\nhard common sense which gave him his disinclination to doctrinal\r\nreligion, and he often checked Seth\xe2\x80\x99s argumentative spiritualism by\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big mystery; thee know\xe2\x80\x99st but little about it.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nso it happened that Adam was at once penetrating and credulous. If a\r\nnew building had fallen down and he had been told that this was a\r\ndivine judgment, he would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cMay be; but the bearing o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nroof and walls wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right, else it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 come down\xe2\x80\x9d; yet he\r\nbelieved in dreams and prognostics, and to his dying day he bated his\r\nbreath a little when he told the story of the stroke with the willow\r\nwand. I tell it as he told it, not attempting to reduce it to its\r\nnatural elements\xe2\x80\x94in our eagerness to explain impressions, we often lose\r\nour hold of the sympathy that comprehends them.\r\n\r\nBut he had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the necessity\r\nfor getting on with the coffin, and for the next ten minutes his hammer\r\nwas ringing so uninterruptedly, that other sounds, if there were any,\r\nmight well be overpowered. A pause came, however, when he had to take\r\nup his ruler, and now again came the strange rap, and again Gyp howled.\r\nAdam was at the door without the loss of a moment; but again all was\r\nstill, and the starlight showed there was nothing but the dew-laden\r\ngrass in front of the cottage.\r\n\r\nAdam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his father; but of late\r\nyears he had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston, and there\r\nwas every reason for believing that he was then sleeping off his\r\ndrunkenness at the \xe2\x80\x9cWaggon Overthrown.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides, to Adam, the\r\nconception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of\r\nhis father that the fear of any fatal accident to him was excluded by\r\nthe deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next thought\r\nthat occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread\r\nlightly upstairs, to listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his\r\nmother were breathing regularly.\r\n\r\nAdam came down and set to work again, saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t open\r\nthe door again. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use staring about to catch sight of a sound.\r\nMaybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a world about us as we can\xe2\x80\x99t see, but th\xe2\x80\x99 ear\xe2\x80\x99s quicker\r\nthan the eye and catches a sound from\xe2\x80\x99t now and then. Some people think\r\nthey get a sight on\xe2\x80\x99t too, but they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly folks whose eyes are not\r\nmuch use to \xe2\x80\x99em at anything else. For my part, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better to\r\nsee when your perpendicular\xe2\x80\x99s true than to see a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as\r\ndaylight quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing. By the time\r\nthe red sunlight shone on the brass nails that formed the initials on\r\nthe lid of the coffin, any lingering foreboding from the sound of the\r\nwillow wand was merged in satisfaction that the work was done and the\r\npromise redeemed. There was no need to call Seth, for he was already\r\nmoving overhead, and presently came downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, as Seth made his appearance, \xe2\x80\x9cthe coffin\xe2\x80\x99s done,\r\nand we can take it over to Brox\xe2\x80\x99on, and be back again before half after\r\nsix. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a mouthful o\xe2\x80\x99 oat-cake, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two brothers,\r\nand they were making their way, followed close by Gyp, out of the\r\nlittle woodyard into the lane at the back of the house. It was but\r\nabout a mile and a half to Broxton over the opposite slope, and their\r\nroad wound very pleasantly along lanes and across fields, where the\r\npale woodbines and the dog-roses were scenting the hedgerows, and the\r\nbirds were twittering and trilling in the tall leafy boughs of oak and\r\nelm. It was a strangely mingled picture\xe2\x80\x94the fresh youth of the summer\r\nmorning, with its Edenlike peace and loveliness, the stalwart strength\r\nof the two brothers in their rusty working clothes, and the long coffin\r\non their shoulders. They paused for the last time before a small\r\nfarmhouse outside the village of Broxton. By six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the task was\r\ndone, the coffin nailed down, and Adam and Seth were on their way home.\r\nThey chose a shorter way homewards, which would take them across the\r\nfields and the brook in front of the house. Adam had not mentioned to\r\nSeth what had happened in the night, but he still retained sufficient\r\nimpression from it himself to say, \xe2\x80\x9cSeth, lad, if Father isn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nhome by the time we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our breakfast, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be as well for\r\nthee to go over to Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on and look after him, and thee canst get\r\nme the brass wire I want. Never mind about losing an hour at thy work;\r\nwe can make that up. What dost say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cBut see what clouds have gathered since we\r\nset out. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking we shall have more rain. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a sore time for\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 haymaking if the meadows are flooded again. The brook\xe2\x80\x99s fine and\r\nfull now: another day\xe2\x80\x99s rain \xe2\x80\x99ud cover the plank, and we should have to\r\ngo round by the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were coming across the valley now, and had entered the pasture\r\nthrough which the brook ran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s that sticking against the willow?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Seth,\r\nbeginning to walk faster. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s heart rose to his mouth: the vague\r\nanxiety about his father was changed into a great dread. He made no\r\nanswer to Seth, but ran forward preceded by Gyp, who began to bark\r\nuneasily; and in two moments he was at the bridge.\r\n\r\nThis was what the omen meant, then! And the grey-haired father, of whom\r\nhe had thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago, as certain to\r\nlive to be a thorn in his side was perhaps even then struggling with\r\nthat watery death! This was the first thought that flashed through\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s conscience, before he had time to seize the coat and drag out\r\nthe tall heavy body. Seth was already by his side, helping him, and\r\nwhen they had it on the bank, the two sons in the first moment knelt\r\nand looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes, forgetting that there was\r\nneed for action\xe2\x80\x94forgetting everything but that their father lay dead\r\nbefore them. Adam was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run to Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a loud whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back to thee\r\nin a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Lisbeth was busy preparing her sons\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast, and their porridge\r\nwas already steaming on the fire. Her kitchen always looked the pink of\r\ncleanliness, but this morning she was more than usually bent on making\r\nher hearth and breakfast-table look comfortable and inviting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lads \xe2\x80\x99ull be fine an\xe2\x80\x99 hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half-aloud, as she\r\nstirred the porridge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good step to Brox\xe2\x80\x99on, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s hungry air\r\no\xe2\x80\x99er the hill\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 that heavy coffin too. Eh! It\xe2\x80\x99s heavier now, wi\xe2\x80\x99 poor\r\nBob Tholer in\xe2\x80\x99t. Howiver, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a drap more porridge nor common\r\nthis mornin\xe2\x80\x99. The feyther \xe2\x80\x99ull happen come in arter a bit. Not as he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nate much porridge. He swallers sixpenn\xe2\x80\x99orth o\xe2\x80\x99 ale, an\xe2\x80\x99 saves a\r\nhap\xe2\x80\x99orth o\xe2\x80\x99 por-ridge\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s his way o\xe2\x80\x99 layin\xe2\x80\x99 by money, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told\r\nhim many a time, an\xe2\x80\x99 am likely to tell him again afore the day\xe2\x80\x99s out.\r\nEh, poor mon, he takes it quiet enough; there\xe2\x80\x99s no denyin\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now Lisbeth heard the heavy \xe2\x80\x9cthud\xe2\x80\x9d of a running footstep on the\r\nturf, and, turning quickly towards the door, she saw Adam enter,\r\nlooking so pale and overwhelmed that she screamed aloud and rushed\r\ntowards him before he had time to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, rather hoarsely, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened.\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s tumbled into the water. Belike we may bring him round again.\r\nSeth and me are going to carry him in. Get a blanket and make it hot as\r\nthe fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn reality Adam was convinced that his father was dead but he knew\r\nthere was no other way of repressing his mother\xe2\x80\x99s impetuous wailing\r\ngrief than by occupying her with some active task which had hope in it.\r\n\r\nHe ran back to Seth, and the two sons lifted the sad burden in\r\nheart-stricken silence. The wide-open glazed eyes were grey, like\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s, and had once looked with mild pride on the boys before whom\r\nThias had lived to hang his head in shame. Seth\xe2\x80\x99s chief feeling was awe\r\nand distress at this sudden snatching away of his father\xe2\x80\x99s soul; but\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s mind rushed back over the past in a flood of relenting and pity.\r\nWhen death, the great Reconciler, has come, it is never our tenderness\r\nthat we repent of, but our severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nThe Rector\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock there had been some heavy storms of rain, and the\r\nwater lay in deep gutters on the sides of the gravel walks in the\r\ngarden of Broxton Parsonage; the great Provence roses had been cruelly\r\ntossed by the wind and beaten by the rain, and all the delicate-stemmed\r\nborder flowers had been dashed down and stained with the wet soil. A\r\nmelancholy morning\xe2\x80\x94because it was nearly time hay-harvest should begin,\r\nand instead of that the meadows were likely to be flooded.\r\n\r\nBut people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they\r\nwould never think of but for the rain. If it had not been a wet\r\nmorning, Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room playing at\r\nchess with his mother, and he loves both his mother and chess quite\r\nwell enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help. Let me\r\ntake you into that dining-room and show you the Rev. Adolphus Irwine,\r\nRector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope, and Vicar of Blythe, a pluralist\r\nat whom the severest Church reformer would have found it difficult to\r\nlook sour. We will enter very softly and stand still in the open\r\ndoorway, without awaking the glossy-brown setter who is stretched\r\nacross the hearth, with her two puppies beside her; or the pug, who is\r\ndozing, with his black muzzle aloft, like a sleepy president.\r\n\r\nThe room is a large and lofty one, with an ample mullioned oriel window\r\nat one end; the walls, you see, are new, and not yet painted; but the\r\nfurniture, though originally of an expensive sort, is old and scanty,\r\nand there is no drapery about the window. The crimson cloth over the\r\nlarge dining-table is very threadbare, though it contrasts pleasantly\r\nenough with the dead hue of the plaster on the walls; but on this cloth\r\nthere is a massive silver waiter with a decanter of water on it, of the\r\nsame pattern as two larger ones that are propped up on the sideboard\r\nwith a coat of arms conspicuous in their centre. You suspect at once\r\nthat the inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood than\r\nwealth, and would not be surprised to find that Mr. Irwine had a finely\r\ncut nostril and upper lip; but at present we can only see that he has a\r\nbroad flat back and an abundance of powdered hair, all thrown backward\r\nand tied behind with a black ribbon\xe2\x80\x94a bit of conservatism in costume\r\nwhich tells you that he is not a young man. He will perhaps turn round\r\nby and by, and in the meantime we can look at that stately old lady,\r\nhis mother, a beautiful aged brunette, whose rich-toned complexion is\r\nwell set off by the complex wrappings of pure white cambric and lace\r\nabout her head and neck. She is as erect in her comely embonpoint as a\r\nstatue of Ceres; and her dark face, with its delicate aquiline nose,\r\nfirm proud mouth, and small, intense, black eye, is so keen and\r\nsarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack of\r\ncards for the chess-men and imagine her telling your fortune. The small\r\nbrown hand with which she is lifting her queen is laden with pearls,\r\ndiamonds, and turquoises; and a large black veil is very carefully\r\nadjusted over the crown of her cap, and falls in sharp contrast on the\r\nwhite folds about her neck. It must take a long time to dress that old\r\nlady in the morning! But it seems a law of nature that she should be\r\ndressed so: she is clearly one of those children of royalty who have\r\nnever doubted their right divine and never met with any one so absurd\r\nas to question it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Dauphin, tell me what that is!\xe2\x80\x9d says this magnificent old lady,\r\nas she deposits her queen very quietly and folds her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be\r\nsorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you witch-mother, you sorceress! How is a Christian man to win a\r\ngame off you? I should have sprinkled the board with holy water before\r\nwe began. You\xe2\x80\x99ve not won that game by fair means, now, so don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the beaten have always said of great conquerors.\r\nBut see, there\xe2\x80\x99s the sunshine falling on the board, to show you more\r\nclearly what a foolish move you made with that pawn. Come, shall I give\r\nyou another chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother, I shall leave you to your own conscience, now it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclearing up. We must go and plash up the mud a little, mus\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\nJuno?\xe2\x80\x9d This was addressed to the brown setter, who had jumped up at the\r\nsound of the voices and laid her nose in an insinuating way on her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s leg. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go upstairs first and see Anne. I was called\r\naway to Tholer\xe2\x80\x99s funeral just when I was going before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no use, child; she can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to you. Kate says she has one\r\nof her worst headaches this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she likes me to go and see her just the same; she\xe2\x80\x99s never too ill\r\nto care about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf you know how much of human speech is mere purposeless impulse or\r\nhabit, you will not wonder when I tell you that this identical\r\nobjection had been made, and had received the same kind of answer, many\r\nhundred times in the course of the fifteen years that Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister Anne had been an invalid. Splendid old ladies, who take a long\r\ntime to dress in the morning, have often slight sympathy with sickly\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nBut while Mr. Irwine was still seated, leaning back in his chair and\r\nstroking Juno\xe2\x80\x99s head, the servant came to the door and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nplease, sir, Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you, if you are at\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him be shown in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine, taking up her knitting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say. His shoes will be\r\ndirty, but see that he wipes them Carroll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn two minutes Mr. Rann appeared at the door with very deferential\r\nbows, which, however, were far from conciliating Pug, who gave a sharp\r\nbark and ran across the room to reconnoitre the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s legs; while\r\nthe two puppies, regarding Mr. Rann\xe2\x80\x99s prominent calf and ribbed worsted\r\nstockings from a more sensuous point of view, plunged and growled over\r\nthem in great enjoyment. Meantime, Mr. Irwine turned round his chair\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joshua, anything the matter at Hayslope, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncome over this damp morning? Sit down, sit down. Never mind the dogs;\r\ngive them a friendly kick. Here, Pug, you rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to see some men turn round; pleasant as a sudden\r\nrush of warm air in winter, or the flash of firelight in the chill\r\ndusk. Mr. Irwine was one of those men. He bore the same sort of\r\nresemblance to his mother that our loving memory of a friend\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\noften bears to the face itself: the lines were all more generous, the\r\nsmile brighter, the expression heartier. If the outline had been less\r\nfinely cut, his face might have been called jolly; but that was not the\r\nright word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Your Reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Rann, endeavouring to look\r\nunconcerned about his legs, but shaking them alternately to keep off\r\nthe puppies; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand, if you please, as more becoming. I hope I see\r\nyou an\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Irwine well, an\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Irwine\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Anne, I hope\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nwell as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joshua, thank you. You see how blooming my mother looks. She\r\nbeats us younger people hollow. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, I had to come to Brox\xe2\x80\x99on to deliver some work, and I thought\r\nit but right to call and let you know the goins-on as there\xe2\x80\x99s been i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe village, such as I hanna seen i\xe2\x80\x99 my time, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in it man\r\nand boy sixty year come St. Thomas, and collected th\xe2\x80\x99 Easter dues for\r\nMr. Blick before Your Reverence come into the parish, and been at the\r\nringin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 every bell, and the diggin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 every grave, and sung i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nchoir long afore Bartle Massey come from nobody knows where, wi\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\ncounter-singin\xe2\x80\x99 and fine anthems, as puts everybody out but himself\xe2\x80\x94one\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 it up after another like sheep a-bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 fold. I know\r\nwhat belongs to bein\xe2\x80\x99 a parish clerk, and I know as I should be wantin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 respect to Your Reverence, an\xe2\x80\x99 church, an\xe2\x80\x99 king, if I was t\xe2\x80\x99 allow\r\nsuch goins-on wi\xe2\x80\x99out speakin\xe2\x80\x99. I was took by surprise, an\xe2\x80\x99 knowed\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 on it beforehand, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was so flustered, I was clean as if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlost my tools. I hanna slep\xe2\x80\x99 more nor four hour this night as is past\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 gone; an\xe2\x80\x99 then it was nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but nightmare, as tired me worse nor\r\nwakin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what in the world is the matter, Joshua? Have the thieves been at\r\nthe church lead again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThieves! No, sir\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 yet, as I may say, it _is_ thieves, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\na-thievin\xe2\x80\x99 the church, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Methodisses as is like to get th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nupper hand i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 parish, if Your Reverence an\xe2\x80\x99 His Honour, Squire\r\nDonnithorne, doesna think well to say the word an\xe2\x80\x99 forbid it. Not as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a-dictatin\xe2\x80\x99 to you, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m not forgettin\xe2\x80\x99 myself so far as to be\r\nwise above my betters. Howiver, whether I\xe2\x80\x99m wise or no, that\xe2\x80\x99s neither\r\nhere nor there, but what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say I say\xe2\x80\x94as the young Methodis\r\nwoman as is at Mester Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s was a-preachin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 a-prayin\xe2\x80\x99 on the\r\nGreen last night, as sure as I\xe2\x80\x99m a-stannin\xe2\x80\x99 afore Your Reverence now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreaching on the Green!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, looking surprised but quite\r\nserene. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, that pale pretty young woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s? I\r\nsaw she was a Methodist, or Quaker, or something of that sort, by her\r\ndress, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was a preacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a true word as I say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Rann, compressing his\r\nmouth into a semicircular form and pausing long enough to indicate\r\nthree notes of exclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cShe preached on the Green last night; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s laid hold of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, as the girl\xe2\x80\x99s been i\xe2\x80\x99 fits welly iver\r\nsin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy Cranage is a hearty-looking lass; I daresay she\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nround again, Joshua. Did anybody else go into fits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I canna say as they did. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowin\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\r\nif we\xe2\x80\x99re t\xe2\x80\x99 have such preachin\xe2\x80\x99s as that a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 on ivery week\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe no livin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 village. For them Methodisses make folks believe as\r\nif they take a mug o\xe2\x80\x99 drink extry, an\xe2\x80\x99 make theirselves a bit\r\ncomfortable, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go to hell for\xe2\x80\x99t as sure as they\xe2\x80\x99re born.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not a tipplin\xe2\x80\x99 man nor a drunkard\xe2\x80\x94nobody can say it on me\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nlike a extry quart at Easter or Christmas time, as is nat\xe2\x80\x99ral when\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 the rounds a-singin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 folks offer\xe2\x80\x99t you for nothin\xe2\x80\x99; or\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m a-collectin\xe2\x80\x99 the dues; an\xe2\x80\x99 I like a pint wi\xe2\x80\x99 my pipe, an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nneighbourly chat at Mester Casson\xe2\x80\x99s now an\xe2\x80\x99 then, for I was brought up\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the Church, thank God, an\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a parish clerk this\r\ntwo-an\xe2\x80\x99-thirty year: I should know what the church religion is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s your advice, Joshua? What do you think should be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Your Reverence, I\xe2\x80\x99m not for takin\xe2\x80\x99 any measures again\xe2\x80\x99 the young\r\nwoman. She\xe2\x80\x99s well enough if she\xe2\x80\x99d let alone preachin\xe2\x80\x99; an\xe2\x80\x99 I hear as\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 away back to her own country soon. She\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nniece, an\xe2\x80\x99 I donna wish to say what\xe2\x80\x99s anyways disrespectful o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfamily at th\xe2\x80\x99 Hall Farm, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve measured for shoes, little an\xe2\x80\x99 big,\r\nwelly iver sin\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a shoemaker. But there\xe2\x80\x99s that Will Maskery,\r\nsir as is the rampageousest Methodis as can be, an\xe2\x80\x99 I make no doubt it\r\nwas him as stirred up th\xe2\x80\x99 young woman to preach last night, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe a-bringin\xe2\x80\x99 other folks to preach from Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on, if his comb isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncut a bit; an\xe2\x80\x99 I think as he should be let know as he isna t\xe2\x80\x99 have the\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 mendin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 church carts an\xe2\x80\x99 implemen\xe2\x80\x99s, let alone stayin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat house an\xe2\x80\x99 yard as is Squire Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you say yourself, Joshua, that you never knew any one come\r\nto preach on the Green before; why should you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll come again?\r\nThe Methodists don\xe2\x80\x99t come to preach in little villages like Hayslope,\r\nwhere there\xe2\x80\x99s only a handful of labourers, too tired to listen to them.\r\nThey might almost as well go and preach on the Binton Hills. Will\r\nMaskery is no preacher himself, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, he\xe2\x80\x99s no gift at stringin\xe2\x80\x99 the words together wi\xe2\x80\x99out book;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be stuck fast like a cow i\xe2\x80\x99 wet clay. But he\xe2\x80\x99s got tongue enough\r\nto speak disrespectful about\xe2\x80\x99s neebors, for he said as I was a blind\r\nPharisee\xe2\x80\x94a-usin\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible i\xe2\x80\x99 that way to find nick-names for folks as\r\nare his elders an\xe2\x80\x99 betters!\xe2\x80\x94and what\xe2\x80\x99s worse, he\xe2\x80\x99s been heard to say\r\nvery unbecomin\xe2\x80\x99 words about Your Reverence; for I could bring them as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud swear as he called you a \xe2\x80\x98dumb dog,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 a \xe2\x80\x98idle shepherd.\xe2\x80\x99 You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nforgi\xe2\x80\x99e me for sayin\xe2\x80\x99 such things over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not, better not, Joshua. Let evil words die as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nspoken. Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow than he is. He\r\nused to be a wild drunken rascal, neglecting his work and beating his\r\nwife, they told me; now he\xe2\x80\x99s thrifty and decent, and he and his wife\r\nlook comfortable together. If you can bring me any proof that he\r\ninterferes with his neighbours and creates any disturbance, I shall\r\nthink it my duty as a clergyman and a magistrate to interfere. But it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t become wise people like you and me to be making a fuss about\r\ntrifles, as if we thought the Church was in danger because Will Maskery\r\nlets his tongue wag rather foolishly, or a young woman talks in a\r\nserious way to a handful of people on the Green. We must \xe2\x80\x98live and let\r\nlive,\xe2\x80\x99 Joshua, in religion as well as in other things. You go on doing\r\nyour duty, as parish clerk and sexton, as well as you\xe2\x80\x99ve always done\r\nit, and making those capital thick boots for your neighbours, and\r\nthings won\xe2\x80\x99t go far wrong in Hayslope, depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Reverence is very good to say so; an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m sensable as, you not\r\nlivin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish, there\xe2\x80\x99s more upo\xe2\x80\x99 my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure; and you must mind and not lower the Church in people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes by seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing, Joshua. I\r\nshall trust to your good sense, now to take no notice at all of what\r\nWill Maskery says, either about you or me. You and your neighbours can\r\ngo on taking your pot of beer soberly, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve done your day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, like good churchmen; and if Will Maskery doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to join\r\nyou, but to go to a prayer-meeting at Treddleston instead, let him;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s no business of yours, so long as he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder you from\r\ndoing what you like. And as to people saying a few idle words about us,\r\nwe must not mind that, any more than the old church-steeple minds the\r\nrooks cawing about it. Will Maskery comes to church every Sunday\r\nafternoon, and does his wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s business steadily in the\r\nweekdays, and as long as he does that he must be let alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir, but when he comes to church, he sits an\xe2\x80\x99 shakes his head, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlooks as sour an\xe2\x80\x99 as coxy when we\xe2\x80\x99re a-singin\xe2\x80\x99 as I should like to\r\nfetch him a rap across the jowl\xe2\x80\x94God forgi\xe2\x80\x99e me\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Irwine, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYour Reverence too, for speakin\xe2\x80\x99 so afore you. An\xe2\x80\x99 he said as our\r\nChristmas singin\xe2\x80\x99 was no better nor the cracklin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 thorns under a\r\npot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a bad ear for music, Joshua. When people have wooden\r\nheads, you know, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped. He won\xe2\x80\x99t bring the other people in\r\nHayslope round to his opinion, while you go on singing as well as you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, but it turns a man\xe2\x80\x99s stomach t\xe2\x80\x99 hear the Scripture misused\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 that way. I know as much o\xe2\x80\x99 the words o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible as he does, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncould say the Psalms right through i\xe2\x80\x99 my sleep if you was to pinch me;\r\nbut I know better nor to take \xe2\x80\x99em to say my own say wi\xe2\x80\x99. I might as\r\nwell take the Sacriment-cup home and use it at meals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very sensible remark of yours, Joshua; but, as I said\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Irwine was speaking, the sound of a booted step and the clink\r\nof a spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrance-hall, and\r\nJoshua Rann moved hastily aside from the doorway to make room for some\r\none who paused there, and said, in a ringing tenor voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodson Arthur\xe2\x80\x94may he come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in, godson!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Irwine answered, in the deep\r\nhalf-masculine tone which belongs to the vigorous old woman, and there\r\nentered a young gentleman in a riding-dress, with his right arm in a\r\nsling; whereupon followed that pleasant confusion of laughing\r\ninterjections, and hand-shakings, and \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d mingled with\r\njoyous short barks and wagging of tails on the part of the canine\r\nmembers of the family, which tells that the visitor is on the best\r\nterms with the visited. The young gentleman was Arthur Donnithorne,\r\nknown in Hayslope, variously, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe young squire,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe heir,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe captain.\xe2\x80\x9d He was only a captain in the Loamshire Militia, but to\r\nthe Hayslope tenants he was more intensely a captain than all the young\r\ngentlemen of the same rank in his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s regulars\xe2\x80\x94he outshone them\r\nas the planet Jupiter outshines the Milky Way. If you want to know more\r\nparticularly how he looked, call to your remembrance some\r\ntawny-whiskered, brown-locked, clear-complexioned young Englishman whom\r\nyou have met with in a foreign town, and been proud of as a\r\nfellow-countryman\xe2\x80\x94well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as\r\nif he could deliver well from \xe2\x80\x98the left shoulder and floor his man: I\r\nwill not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the\r\ndifference of costume, and insist on the striped waistcoat, long-tailed\r\ncoat, and low top-boots.\r\n\r\nTurning round to take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme interrupt Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s business\xe2\x80\x94he has something to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbly begging Your Honour\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joshua, bowing low, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nwas one thing I had to say to His Reverence as other things had drove\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with it, Joshua, quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelike, sir, you havena heared as Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x99s dead\xe2\x80\x94drownded this\r\nmorning, or more like overnight, i\xe2\x80\x99 the Willow Brook, again\xe2\x80\x99 the bridge\r\nright i\xe2\x80\x99 front o\xe2\x80\x99 the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed both the gentlemen at once, as if they were a good deal\r\ninterested in the information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 Seth Bede\xe2\x80\x99s been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell\r\nYour Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular t\xe2\x80\x99 allow\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s grave to be dug by the White Thorn, because his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nset her heart on it, on account of a dream as she had; an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncome theirselves to ask you, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve so much to see after with the\r\ncrowner, an\xe2\x80\x99 that; an\xe2\x80\x99 their mother\xe2\x80\x99s took on so, an\xe2\x80\x99 wants \xe2\x80\x99em to make\r\nsure o\xe2\x80\x99 the spot for fear somebody else should take it. An\xe2\x80\x99 if Your\r\nReverence sees well and good, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send my boy to tell \xe2\x80\x99em as soon as I\r\nget home; an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s why I make bold to trouble you wi\xe2\x80\x99 it, His Honour\r\nbeing present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, Joshua, to be sure, they shall have it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride round to\r\nAdam myself, and see him. Send your boy, however, to say they shall\r\nhave the grave, lest anything should happen to detain me. And now, good\r\nmorning, Joshua; go into the kitchen and have some ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Thias!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, when Joshua was gone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nthe drink helped the brook to drown him. I should have been glad for\r\nthe load to have been taken off my friend Adam\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders in a less\r\npainful way. That fine fellow has been propping up his father from ruin\r\nfor the last five or six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a regular trump, is Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was\r\na little fellow, and Adam was a strapping lad of fifteen, and taught me\r\ncarpentering, I used to think if ever I was a rich sultan, I would make\r\nAdam my grand-vizier. And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as\r\nwell as any poor wise man in an Eastern story. If ever I live to be a\r\nlarge-acred man instead of a poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of\r\npocket-money, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Adam for my right hand. He shall manage my\r\nwoods for me, for he seems to have a better notion of those things than\r\nany man I ever met with; and I know he would make twice the money of\r\nthem that my grandfather does, with that miserable old Satchell to\r\nmanage, who understands no more about timber than an old carp. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice, but for some\r\nreason or other he has a dislike to Adam, and _I_ can do nothing. But\r\ncome, Your Reverence, are you for a ride with me? It\xe2\x80\x99s splendid out of\r\ndoors now. We can go to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s together, if you like; but I want to\r\ncall at the Hall Farm on my way, to look at the whelps Poyser is\r\nkeeping for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must stay and have lunch first, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnearly two. Carroll will bring it in directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to the Hall Farm too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, \xe2\x80\x9cto have another\r\nlook at the little Methodist who is staying there. Joshua tells me she\r\nwas preaching on the Green last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she looks as\r\nquiet as a mouse. There\xe2\x80\x99s something rather striking about her, though.\r\nI positively felt quite bashful the first time I saw her\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nsitting stooping over her sewing in the sunshine outside the house,\r\nwhen I rode up and called out, without noticing that she was a\r\nstranger, \xe2\x80\x98Is Martin Poyser at home?\xe2\x80\x99 I declare, when she got up and\r\nlooked at me and just said, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s in the house, I believe: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\ncall him,\xe2\x80\x99 I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so abruptly to her.\r\nShe looked like St. Catherine in a Quaker dress. It\xe2\x80\x99s a type of face\r\none rarely sees among our common people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see the young woman, Dauphin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake her come here on some pretext or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can manage that, Mother; it will hardly do for me\r\nto patronize a Methodist preacher, even if she would consent to be\r\npatronized by an idle shepherd, as Will Maskery calls me. You should\r\nhave come in a little sooner, Arthur, to hear Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s denunciation of\r\nhis neighbour Will Maskery. The old fellow wants me to excommunicate\r\nthe wheelwright, and then deliver him over to the civil arm\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, to your grandfather\xe2\x80\x94to be turned out of house and yard. If I chose\r\nto interfere in this business, now, I might get up as pretty a story of\r\nhatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in the\r\nnext number of their magazine. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take me much trouble to\r\npersuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bull-headed fellows that\r\nthey would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will\r\nMaskery out of the village with rope-ends and pitchforks; and then,\r\nwhen I had furnished them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk\r\nafter their exertions, I should have put the climax to as pretty a\r\nfarce as any of my brother clergy have set going in their parishes for\r\nthe last thirty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really insolent of the man, though, to call you an \xe2\x80\x98idle\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98dumb dog,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be inclined to\r\ncheck him a little there. You are too easy-tempered, Dauphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mother, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be a good way of sustaining my\r\ndignity to set about vindicating myself from the aspersions of Will\r\nMaskery? Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure that they _are_ aspersions. I _am_ a\r\nlazy fellow, and get terribly heavy in my saddle; not to mention that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m always spending more than I can afford in bricks and mortar, so\r\nthat I get savage at a lame beggar when he asks me for sixpence. Those\r\npoor lean cobblers, who think they can help to regenerate mankind by\r\nsetting out to preach in the morning twilight before they begin their\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work, may well have a poor opinion of me. But come, let us have\r\nour luncheon. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Kate coming to lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Irwine told Bridget to take her lunch upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carroll;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe can\xe2\x80\x99t leave Miss Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. Tell Bridget to say I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up and see Miss Anne\r\npresently. You can use your right arm quite well now, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nIrwine continued, observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm\r\nout of the sling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pretty well; but Godwin insists on my keeping it up constantly\r\nfor some time to come. I hope I shall be able to get away to the\r\nregiment, though, in the beginning of August. It\xe2\x80\x99s a desperately dull\r\nbusiness being shut up at the Chase in the summer months, when one can\r\nneither hunt nor shoot, so as to make one\xe2\x80\x99s self pleasantly sleepy in\r\nthe evening. However, we are to astonish the echoes on the 30th of\r\nJuly. My grandfather has given me _carte blanche_ for once, and I\r\npromise you the entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion. The\r\nworld will not see the grand epoch of my majority twice. I think I\r\nshall have a lofty throne for you, Godmamma, or rather two, one on the\r\nlawn and another in the ballroom, that you may sit and look down upon\r\nus like an Olympian goddess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to bring out my best brocade, that I wore at your christening\r\ntwenty years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I think I shall see your poor\r\nmother flitting about in her white dress, which looked to me almost\r\nlike a shroud that very day; and it _was_ her shroud only three months\r\nafter; and your little cap and christening dress were buried with her\r\ntoo. She had set her heart on that, sweet soul! Thank God you take\r\nafter your mother\xe2\x80\x99s family, Arthur. If you had been a puny, wiry,\r\nyellow baby, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stood godmother to you. I should have been\r\nsure you would turn out a Donnithorne. But you were such a broad-faced,\r\nbroad-chested, loud-screaming rascal, I knew you were every inch of you\r\na Tradgett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you might have been a little too hasty there, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nIrwine, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how it was with Juno\xe2\x80\x99s last pups?\r\nOne of them was the very image of its mother, but it had two or three\r\nof its father\xe2\x80\x99s tricks notwithstanding. Nature is clever enough to\r\ncheat even you, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child! Nature never makes a ferret in the shape of a\r\nmastiff. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never persuade me that I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what men are by\r\ntheir outsides. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t like a man\xe2\x80\x99s looks, depend upon it I shall\r\nnever like _him_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know people that look ugly and\r\ndisagreeable, any more than I want to taste dishes that look\r\ndisagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I say, take\r\nthem away. An ugly, piggish, or fishy eye, now, makes me feel quite\r\nill; it\xe2\x80\x99s like a bad smell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat reminds me that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a book I meant to bring you, Godmamma. It came down in a parcel\r\nfrom London the other day. I know you are fond of queer, wizardlike\r\nstories. It\xe2\x80\x99s a volume of poems, \xe2\x80\x98Lyrical Ballads.\xe2\x80\x99 Most of them seem\r\nto be twaddling stuff, but the first is in a different style\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nAncient Mariner\xe2\x80\x99 is the title. I can hardly make head or tail of it as\r\na story, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a strange, striking thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it over to you;\r\nand there are some other books that _you_ may like to see,\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x94pamphlets about Antinomianism and Evangelicalism, whatever they\r\nmay be. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think what the fellow means by sending such things to\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written to him to desire that from henceforth he will send me\r\nno book or pamphlet on anything that ends in _ism_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of _isms_ myself; but I may as\r\nwell look at the pamphlets; they let one see what is going on. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nlittle matter to attend to, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Irwine, rising to\r\nleave the room, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I shall be ready to set out with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him up the old\r\nstone staircase (part of the house was very old) and made him pause\r\nbefore a door at which he knocked gently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that\r\nMiss Kate, the thin middle-aged lady standing by the bedside, would not\r\nhave had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting\r\nwhich lay on the little table near her. But at present she was doing\r\nwhat required only the dimmest light\xe2\x80\x94sponging the aching head that lay\r\non the pillow with fresh vinegar. It was a small face, that of the poor\r\nsufferer; perhaps it had once been pretty, but now it was worn and\r\nsallow. Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nto her; she can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to be spoken to to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were\r\nclosed, and her brow contracted as if from intense pain. Mr. Irwine\r\nwent to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed\r\nit, a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was\r\nworth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that. He\r\nlingered a moment, looking at her, and then turned away and left the\r\nroom, treading very gently\xe2\x80\x94he had taken off his boots and put on\r\nslippers before he came upstairs. Whoever remembers how many things he\r\nhas declined to do even for himself, rather than have the trouble of\r\nputting on or taking off his boots, will not think this last detail\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s sisters, as any person of family within ten miles of\r\nBroxton could have testified, were such stupid, uninteresting women! It\r\nwas quite a pity handsome, clever Mrs. Irwine should have had such\r\ncommonplace daughters. That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten\r\nmiles to see, any day; her beauty, her well-preserved faculties, and\r\nher old-fashioned dignity made her a graceful subject for conversation\r\nin turn with the King\xe2\x80\x99s health, the sweet new patterns in cotton\r\ndresses, the news from Egypt, and Lord Dacey\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit, which was\r\nfretting poor Lady Dacey to death. But no one ever thought of\r\nmentioning the Miss Irwines, except the poor people in Broxton village,\r\nwho regarded them as deep in the science of medicine, and spoke of them\r\nvaguely as \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentlefolks.\xe2\x80\x9d If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who\r\ngave him his flannel jacket, he would have answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentlefolks,\r\nlast winter\xe2\x80\x9d; and widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe gentlefolks gave her for her cough. Under this name too, they were\r\nused with great effect as a means of taming refractory children, so\r\nthat at the sight of poor Miss Anne\xe2\x80\x99s sallow face, several small\r\nurchins had a terrified sense that she was cognizant of all their worst\r\nmisdemeanours, and knew the precise number of stones with which they\r\nhad intended to hit Farmer Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ducks. But for all who saw them\r\nthrough a less mythical medium, the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous\r\nexistences\xe2\x80\x94inartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without\r\nadequate effect. Miss Anne, indeed, if her chronic headaches could have\r\nbeen accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love, might have\r\nhad some romantic interest attached to her: but no such story had\r\neither been known or invented concerning her, and the general\r\nimpression was quite in accordance with the fact, that both the sisters\r\nwere old maids for the prosaic reason that they had never received an\r\neligible offer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to speak paradoxically, the existence of insignificant\r\npeople has very important consequences in the world. It can be shown to\r\naffect the price of bread and the rate of wages, to call forth many\r\nevil tempers from the selfish and many heroisms from the sympathetic,\r\nand, in other ways, to play no small part in the tragedy of life. And\r\nif that handsome, generous-blooded clergyman, the Rev. Adolphus Irwine,\r\nhad not had these two hopelessly maiden sisters, his lot would have\r\nbeen shaped quite differently: he would very likely have taken a comely\r\nwife in his youth, and now, when his hair was getting grey under the\r\npowder, would have had tall sons and blooming daughters\xe2\x80\x94such\r\npossessions, in short, as men commonly think will repay them for all\r\nthe labour they take under the sun. As it was\xe2\x80\x94having with all his three\r\nlivings no more than seven hundred a-year, and seeing no way of keeping\r\nhis splendid mother and his sickly sister, not to reckon a second\r\nsister, who was usually spoken of without any adjective, in such\r\nladylike ease as became their birth and habits, and at the same time\r\nproviding for a family of his own\xe2\x80\x94he remained, you see, at the age of\r\neight-and-forty, a bachelor, not making any merit of that renunciation,\r\nbut saying laughingly, if any one alluded to it, that he made it an\r\nexcuse for many indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him.\r\nAnd perhaps he was the only person in the world who did not think his\r\nsisters uninteresting and superfluous; for his was one of those\r\nlarge-hearted, sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or a\r\ngrudging thought; Epicurean, if you will, with no enthusiasm, no\r\nself-scourging sense of duty; but yet, as you have seen, of a\r\nsufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness for\r\nobscure and monotonous suffering. It was his large-hearted indulgence\r\nthat made him ignore his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hardness towards her daughters, which\r\nwas the more striking from its contrast with her doting fondness\r\ntowards himself; he held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults.\r\n\r\nSee the difference between the impression a man makes on you when you\r\nwalk by his side in familiar talk, or look at him in his home, and the\r\nfigure he makes when seen from a lofty historical level, or even in the\r\neyes of a critical neighbour who thinks of him as an embodied system or\r\nopinion rather than as a man. Mr. Roe, the \xe2\x80\x9ctravelling preacher\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nstationed at Treddleston, had included Mr. Irwine in a general\r\nstatement concerning the Church clergy in the surrounding district,\r\nwhom he described as men given up to the lusts of the flesh and the\r\npride of life; hunting and shooting, and adorning their own houses;\r\nasking what shall we eat, and what shall we drink, and wherewithal\r\nshall we be clothed?\xe2\x80\x94careless of dispensing the bread of life to their\r\nflocks, preaching at best but a carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and\r\ntrafficking in the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the\r\npastoral office in parishes where they did not so much as look on the\r\nfaces of the people more than once a-year. The ecclesiastical\r\nhistorian, too, looking into parliamentary reports of that period,\r\nfinds honourable members zealous for the Church, and untainted with any\r\nsympathy for the \xe2\x80\x9ctribe of canting Methodists,\xe2\x80\x9d making statements\r\nscarcely less melancholy than that of Mr. Roe. And it is impossible for\r\nme to say that Mr. Irwine was altogether belied by the generic\r\nclassification assigned him. He really had no very lofty aims, no\r\ntheological enthusiasm: if I were closely questioned, I should be\r\nobliged to confess that he felt no serious alarms about the souls of\r\nhis parishioners, and would have thought it a mere loss of time to talk\r\nin a doctrinal and awakening manner to old \xe2\x80\x9cFeyther Taft,\xe2\x80\x9d or even to\r\nChad Cranage the blacksmith. If he had been in the habit of speaking\r\ntheoretically, he would perhaps have said that the only healthy form\r\nreligion could take in such minds was that of certain dim but strong\r\nemotions, suffusing themselves as a hallowing influence over the family\r\naffections and neighbourly duties. He thought the custom of baptism\r\nmore important than its doctrine, and that the religious benefits the\r\npeasant drew from the church where his fathers worshipped and the\r\nsacred piece of turf where they lay buried were but slightly dependent\r\non a clear understanding of the Liturgy or the sermon. Clearly the\r\nrector was not what is called in these days an \xe2\x80\x9cearnest\xe2\x80\x9d man: he was\r\nfonder of church history than of divinity, and had much more insight\r\ninto men\xe2\x80\x99s characters than interest in their opinions; he was neither\r\nlaborious, nor obviously self-denying, nor very copious in alms-giving,\r\nand his theology, you perceive, was lax. His mental palate, indeed, was\r\nrather pagan, and found a savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or\r\nTheocritus that was quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos. But\r\nif you feed your young setter on raw flesh, how can you wonder at its\r\nretaining a relish for uncooked partridge in after-life? And Mr.\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x99s recollections of young enthusiasm and ambition were all\r\nassociated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the Bible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate partiality\r\ntowards the rector\xe2\x80\x99s memory, that he was not vindictive\xe2\x80\x94and some\r\nphilanthropists have been so; that he was not intolerant\xe2\x80\x94and there is a\r\nrumour that some zealous theologians have not been altogether free from\r\nthat blemish; that although he would probably have declined to give his\r\nbody to be burned in any public cause, and was far from bestowing all\r\nhis goods to feed the poor, he had that charity which has sometimes\r\nbeen lacking to very illustrious virtue\xe2\x80\x94he was tender to other men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfailings, and unwilling to impute evil. He was one of those men, and\r\nthey are not the commonest, of whom we can know the best only by\r\nfollowing them away from the marketplace, the platform, and the pulpit,\r\nentering with them into their own homes, hearing the voice with which\r\nthey speak to the young and aged about their own hearthstone, and\r\nwitnessing their thoughtful care for the everyday wants of everyday\r\ncompanions, who take all their kindness as a matter of course, and not\r\nas a subject for panegyric.\r\n\r\nSuch men, happily, have lived in times when great abuses flourished,\r\nand have sometimes even been the living representatives of the abuses.\r\nThat is a thought which might comfort us a little under the opposite\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94that it is better sometimes _not_ to follow great reformers of\r\nabuses beyond the threshold of their homes.\r\n\r\nBut whatever you may think of Mr. Irwine now, if you had met him that\r\nJune afternoon riding on his grey cob, with his dogs running beside\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94portly, upright, manly, with a good-natured smile on his finely\r\nturned lips as he talked to his dashing young companion on the bay\r\nmare, you must have felt that, however ill he harmonized with sound\r\ntheories of the clerical office, he somehow harmonized extremely well\r\nwith that peaceful landscape.\r\n\r\nSee them in the bright sunlight, interrupted every now and then by\r\nrolling masses of cloud, ascending the slope from the Broxton side,\r\nwhere the tall gables and elms of the rectory predominate over the tiny\r\nwhitewashed church. They will soon be in the parish of Hayslope; the\r\ngrey church-tower and village roofs lie before them to the left, and\r\nfarther on, to the right, they can just see the chimneys of the Hall\r\nFarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\nThe Hall Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and the great\r\nhemlocks grow close against it, and if it were opened, it is so rusty\r\nthat the force necessary to turn it on its hinges would be likely to\r\npull down the square stone-built pillars, to the detriment of the two\r\nstone lionesses which grin with a doubtful carnivorous affability above\r\na coat of arms surmounting each of the pillars. It would be easy\r\nenough, by the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars, to climb over the\r\nbrick wall with its smooth stone coping; but by putting our eyes close\r\nto the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well enough, and\r\nall but the very corners of the grassy enclosure.\r\n\r\nIt is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery\r\nlichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to\r\nbring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the\r\nlimestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the\r\ndoor-place. But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the\r\ndoor, I think, is like the gate\xe2\x80\x94it is never opened. How it would groan\r\nand grate against the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy,\r\nhandsome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a\r\nsonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen his master\r\nand mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair.\r\n\r\nBut at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a\r\nchancery suit, and that the fruit from that grand double row of\r\nwalnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot\r\namong the grass, if it were not that we heard the booming bark of dogs\r\nechoing from great buildings at the back. And now the half-weaned\r\ncalves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorse-built hovel\r\nagainst the left-hand wall come out and set up a silly answer to that\r\nterrible bark, doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nYes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom; for\r\nimagination is a licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs, but may\r\nclimb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity. Put your face to\r\none of the glass panes in the right-hand window: what do you see? A\r\nlarge open fireplace, with rusty dogs in it, and a bare boarded floor;\r\nat the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up; in the middle of the floor,\r\nsome empty corn-bags. That is the furniture of the dining-room. And\r\nwhat through the left-hand window? Several clothes-horses, a pillion, a\r\nspinning-wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of coloured\r\nrags. At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll, which, so\r\nfar as mutilation is concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the\r\nfinest Greek sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose.\r\nNear it there is a little chair, and the butt end of a boy\xe2\x80\x99s leather\r\nlong-lashed whip.\r\n\r\nThe history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence of a\r\ncountry squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to mere\r\nspinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial name of Donnithorne.\r\nIt was once the Hall; it is now the Hall Farm. Like the life in some\r\ncoast town that was once a watering-place, and is now a port, where the\r\ngenteel streets are silent and grass-grown, and the docks and\r\nwarehouses busy and resonant, the life at the Hall has changed its\r\nfocus, and no longer radiates from the parlour, but from the kitchen\r\nand the farmyard.\r\n\r\nPlenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year,\r\njust before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too,\r\nfor it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by\r\nMrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s handsome eight-day clock. But there is always a stronger\r\nsense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is\r\npouring down his beams, and making sparkles among the wet straw, and\r\nlighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the\r\ncow-shed, and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the\r\nchannel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are\r\nseizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as\r\npossible. There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog,\r\nchained against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the\r\nunwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends\r\nforth a thundering bark, which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in\r\nthe opposite cow-house; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their\r\nchicks among the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the\r\ndiscomfited cock joins them; a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to\r\nthe legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato\r\nnotes; our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and,\r\nunder all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.\r\n\r\nFor the great barn-doors are thrown wide open, and men are busy there\r\nmending the harness, under the superintendence of Mr. Goby, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhittaw,\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise saddler, who entertains them with the latest\r\nTreddleston gossip. It is certainly rather an unfortunate day that\r\nAlick, the shepherd, has chosen for having the whittaws, since the\r\nmorning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser has spoken her mind pretty\r\nstrongly as to the dirt which the extra number of men\xe2\x80\x99s shoes brought\r\ninto the house at dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered her\r\nequanimity on the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since\r\ndinner, and the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as\r\neverything else in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance of\r\ncollecting a few grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer,\r\nand put your finger on the high mantel-shelf on which the glittering\r\nbrass candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure; for at this time\r\nof year, of course, every one goes to bed while it is yet light, or at\r\nleast light enough to discern the outline of objects after you have\r\nbruised your shins against them. Surely nowhere else could an oak\r\nclock-case and an oak table have got to such a polish by the hand:\r\ngenuine \xe2\x80\x9celbow polish,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked God\r\nshe never had any of your varnished rubbish in her house. Hetty Sorrel\r\noften took the opportunity, when her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned, of looking\r\nat the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces, for\r\nthe oak table was usually turned up like a screen, and was more for\r\nornament than for use; and she could see herself sometimes in the great\r\nround pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves above the long deal\r\ndinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate, which always shone like\r\njasper.\r\n\r\nEverything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for the sun\r\nshone right on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting surfaces\r\npleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and bright brass\xe2\x80\x94and\r\non a still pleasanter object than these, for some of the rays fell on\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s finely moulded cheek, and lit up her pale red hair to auburn,\r\nas she bent over the heavy household linen which she was mending for\r\nher aunt. No scene could have been more peaceful, if Mrs. Poyser, who\r\nwas ironing a few things that still remained from the Monday\xe2\x80\x99s wash,\r\nhad not been making a frequent clinking with her iron and moving to and\r\nfro whenever she wanted it to cool; carrying the keen glance of her\r\nblue-grey eye from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was making up\r\nthe butter, and from the dairy to the back kitchen, where Nancy was\r\ntaking the pies out of the oven. Do not suppose, however, that Mrs.\r\nPoyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance; she was a\r\ngood-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion\r\nand sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed. The most conspicuous article\r\nin her attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered\r\nher skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap\r\nand gown, for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than\r\nfeminine vanity, and the preference of ornament to utility. The family\r\nlikeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast\r\nbetween her keenness and Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s seraphic gentleness of expression,\r\nmight have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and\r\nMary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of\r\nthe difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of Trip,\r\nthe black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected dog unwarily\r\nexposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s glance. Her\r\ntongue was not less keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came\r\nwithin earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a\r\nbarrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was\r\ninconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently, Mrs. Poyser\r\nshould scold Molly the housemaid with unusual severity. To all\r\nappearance Molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary\r\nmanner, had \xe2\x80\x9ccleaned herself\xe2\x80\x9d with great dispatch, and now came to ask,\r\nsubmissively, if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time.\r\nBut this blameless conduct, according to Mrs. Poyser, shrouded a secret\r\nindulgence of unbecoming wishes, which she now dragged forth and held\r\nup to Molly\xe2\x80\x99s view with cutting eloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpinning, indeed! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t spinning as you\xe2\x80\x99d be at, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, and\r\nlet you have your own way. I never knew your equals for gallowsness. To\r\nthink of a gell o\xe2\x80\x99 your age wanting to go and sit with half-a-dozen\r\nmen! I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been ashamed to let the words pass over my lips if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen you. And you, as have been here ever since last Michaelmas, and I\r\nhired you at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on stattits, without a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 character\xe2\x80\x94as I say,\r\nyou might be grateful to be hired in that way to a respectable place;\r\nand you knew no more o\xe2\x80\x99 what belongs to work when you come here than\r\nthe mawkin i\xe2\x80\x99 the field. As poor a two-fisted thing as ever I saw, you\r\nknow you was. Who taught you to scrub a floor, I should like to know?\r\nWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99d leave the dirt in heaps i\xe2\x80\x99 the corners\xe2\x80\x94anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d never been brought up among Christians. And as for spinning, why,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve wasted as much as your wage i\xe2\x80\x99 the flax you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoiled learning\r\nto spin. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to feel that, and not to go about as gaping\r\nand as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody. Comb the wool for\r\nthe whittaws, indeed! That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d like to be doing, is it? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way with you\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the road you\xe2\x80\x99d all like to go, headlongs to\r\nruin. You\xe2\x80\x99re never easy till you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some sweetheart as is as big a\r\nfool as yourself: you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be finely off when you\xe2\x80\x99re married, I\r\ndaresay, and have got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a\r\nblanket to cover you, and a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 oat-cake for your dinner, as three\r\nchildren are a-snatching at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I donna want t\xe2\x80\x99 go wi\xe2\x80\x99 the whittaws,\xe2\x80\x9d said Molly, whimpering,\r\nand quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future, \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x99y we\r\nallays used to comb the wool for \xe2\x80\x99n at Mester Ottley\xe2\x80\x99s; an\xe2\x80\x99 so I just\r\naxed ye. I donna want to set eyes on the whittaws again; I wish I may\r\nnever stir if I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Ottley\xe2\x80\x99s, indeed! It\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking o\xe2\x80\x99 what you did at Mr.\r\nOttley\xe2\x80\x99s. Your missis there might like her floors dirted wi\xe2\x80\x99 whittaws\r\nfor what I know. There\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what people _wonna_ like\xe2\x80\x94such ways\r\nas I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of! I never had a gell come into my house as seemed to\r\nknow what cleaning was; I think people live like pigs, for my part. And\r\nas to that Betty as was dairymaid at Trent\xe2\x80\x99s before she come to me,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 left the cheeses without turning from week\xe2\x80\x99s end to week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend, and the dairy thralls, I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 wrote my name on \xe2\x80\x99em, when I\r\ncome downstairs after my illness, as the doctor said it was\r\ninflammation\xe2\x80\x94it was a mercy I got well of it. And to think o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nknowing no better, Molly, and been here a-going i\xe2\x80\x99 nine months, and not\r\nfor want o\xe2\x80\x99 talking to, neither\xe2\x80\x94and what are you stanning there for,\r\nlike a jack as is run down, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 getting your wheel out? You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nrare un for sitting down to your work a little while after it\xe2\x80\x99s time to\r\nput by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMunny, my iron\xe2\x80\x99s twite told; pease put it down to warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from a little\r\nsunny-haired girl between three and four, who, seated on a high chair\r\nat the end of the ironing table, was arduously clutching the handle of\r\na miniature iron with her tiny fat fist, and ironing rags with an\r\nassiduity that required her to put her little red tongue out as far as\r\nanatomy would allow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, who\r\nwas remarkable for the facility with which she could relapse from her\r\nofficial objurgatory to one of fondness or of friendly converse. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nmind! Mother\xe2\x80\x99s done her ironing now. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to put the ironing\r\nthings away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMunny, I tould \xe2\x80\x99ike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see de whittawd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no; Totty \xe2\x80\x99ud get her feet wet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, carrying\r\naway her iron. \xe2\x80\x9cRun into the dairy and see cousin Hetty make the\r\nbutter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tould \xe2\x80\x99ike a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pum-take,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Totty, who seemed to be\r\nprovided with several relays of requests; at the same time, taking the\r\nopportunity of her momentary leisure to put her fingers into a bowl of\r\nstarch, and drag it down so as to empty the contents with tolerable\r\ncompleteness on to the ironing sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ever anybody see the like?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Mrs. Poyser, running towards\r\nthe table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallays i\xe2\x80\x99 mischief if your back\xe2\x80\x99s turned a minute. What shall I do to\r\nyou, you naughty, naughty gell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTotty, however, had descended from her chair with great swiftness, and\r\nwas already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run,\r\nand an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like\r\nthe metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.\r\n\r\nThe starch having been wiped up by Molly\xe2\x80\x99s help, and the ironing\r\napparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which always lay\r\nready at hand, and was the work she liked best, because she could carry\r\nit on automatically as she walked to and fro. But now she came and sat\r\ndown opposite Dinah, whom she looked at in a meditative way, as she\r\nknitted her grey worsted stocking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look th\xe2\x80\x99 image o\xe2\x80\x99 your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you sit a-sewing.\r\nI could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a little gell\r\nat home, looking at Judith as she sat at her work, after she\xe2\x80\x99d done the\r\nhouse up; only it was a little cottage, Father\xe2\x80\x99s was, and not a big\r\nrambling house as gets dirty i\xe2\x80\x99 one corner as fast as you clean it in\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94but for all that, I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith, only\r\nher hair was a deal darker than yours, and she was stouter and broader\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the shoulders. Judith and me allays hung together, though she had\r\nsuch queer ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah, your\r\nmother little thought as she\xe2\x80\x99d have a daughter just cut out after the\r\nvery pattern o\xe2\x80\x99 Judith, and leave her an orphan, too, for Judith to\r\ntake care on, and bring up with a spoon when _she_ was in the graveyard\r\nat Stoniton. I allays said that o\xe2\x80\x99 Judith, as she\xe2\x80\x99d bear a pound weight\r\nany day to save anybody else carrying a ounce. And she was just the\r\nsame from the first o\xe2\x80\x99 my remembering her; it made no difference in\r\nher, as I could see, when she took to the Methodists, only she talked a\r\nbit different and wore a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99 cap; but she\xe2\x80\x99d never in her\r\nlife spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a blessed woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cGod had given her a loving,\r\nself-forgetting nature, and He perfected it by grace. And she was very\r\nfond of you too, Aunt Rachel. I often heard her talk of you in the same\r\nsort of way. When she had that bad illness, and I was only eleven years\r\nold, she used to say, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a friend on earth in your Aunt\r\nRachel, if I\xe2\x80\x99m taken from you, for she has a kind heart,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve found it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how, child; anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud be cunning to do anything for\r\nyou, I think; you\xe2\x80\x99re like the birds o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 air, and live nobody knows\r\nhow. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been glad to behave to you like a mother\xe2\x80\x99s sister, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d come and live i\xe2\x80\x99 this country where there\xe2\x80\x99s some shelter and\r\nvictual for man and beast, and folks don\xe2\x80\x99t live on the naked hills,\r\nlike poultry a-scratching on a gravel bank. And then you might get\r\nmarried to some decent man, and there\xe2\x80\x99d be plenty ready to have you, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d only leave off that preaching, as is ten times worse than\r\nanything your Aunt Judith ever did. And even if you\xe2\x80\x99d marry Seth Bede,\r\nas is a poor wool-gathering Methodist and\xe2\x80\x99s never like to have a penny\r\nbeforehand, I know your uncle \xe2\x80\x99ud help you with a pig, and very like a\r\ncow, for he\xe2\x80\x99s allays been good-natur\xe2\x80\x99d to my kin, for all they\xe2\x80\x99re poor,\r\nand made \xe2\x80\x99em welcome to the house; and \xe2\x80\x99ud do for you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\r\nas much as ever he\xe2\x80\x99d do for Hetty, though she\xe2\x80\x99s his own niece. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s linen in the house as I could well spare you, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got lots\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 sheeting and table-clothing, and towelling, as isn\xe2\x80\x99t made up.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a piece o\xe2\x80\x99 sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty\r\nspun\xe2\x80\x94she was a rare girl to spin, for all she squinted, and the\r\nchildren couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide her; and, you know, the spinning\xe2\x80\x99s going on\r\nconstant, and there\xe2\x80\x99s new linen wove twice as fast as the old wears\r\nout. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 talking, if ye wonna be persuaded, and\r\nsettle down like any other woman in her senses, i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 wearing\r\nyourself out with walking and preaching, and giving away every penny\r\nyou get, so as you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing saved against sickness; and all the\r\nthings you\xe2\x80\x99ve got i\xe2\x80\x99 the world, I verily believe, \xe2\x80\x99ud go into a bundle\r\nno bigger nor a double cheese. And all because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got notions i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour head about religion more nor what\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 the Catechism and the\r\nPrayer-book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not more than what\xe2\x80\x99s in the Bible, Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the Bible too, for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Poyser rejoined, rather\r\nsharply; \xe2\x80\x9celse why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t them as know best what\xe2\x80\x99s in the Bible\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nparsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn it\xe2\x80\x94do the same\r\nas you do? But, for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 that, if everybody was to do like\r\nyou, the world must come to a standstill; for if everybody tried to do\r\nwithout house and home, and with poor eating and drinking, and was\r\nallays talking as we must despise the things o\xe2\x80\x99 the world as you say, I\r\nshould like to know where the pick o\xe2\x80\x99 the stock, and the corn, and the\r\nbest new-milk cheeses \xe2\x80\x99ud have to go. Everybody \xe2\x80\x99ud be wanting bread\r\nmade o\xe2\x80\x99 tail ends and everybody \xe2\x80\x99ud be running after everybody else to\r\npreach to \xe2\x80\x99em, istead o\xe2\x80\x99 bringing up their families, and laying by\r\nagainst a bad harvest. It stands to sense as that can\xe2\x80\x99t be the right\r\nreligion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to\r\nforsake their work and their families. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite right the land should\r\nbe ploughed and sowed, and the precious corn stored, and the things of\r\nthis life cared for, and right that people should rejoice in their\r\nfamilies, and provide for them, so that this is done in the fear of the\r\nLord, and that they are not unmindful of the soul\xe2\x80\x99s wants while they\r\nare caring for the body. We can all be servants of God wherever our lot\r\nis cast, but He gives us different sorts of work, according as He fits\r\nus for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in\r\ntrying to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help\r\nrunning if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house;\r\nthe voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in\r\ntrouble or in danger, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest without running to help her\r\nand comfort her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours. You\xe2\x80\x99d make me\r\nthe same answer, at th\xe2\x80\x99 end. I might as well talk to the running brook\r\nand tell it to stan\xe2\x80\x99 still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for Mrs.\r\nPoyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was going on in the\r\nyard, the grey worsted stocking making a steady progress in her hands\r\nall the while. But she had not been standing there more than five\r\nminutes before she came in again, and said to Dinah, in rather a\r\nflurried, awe-stricken tone, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there isn\xe2\x80\x99t Captain Donnithorne and\r\nMr. Irwine a-coming into the yard! I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay my life they\xe2\x80\x99re come to\r\nspeak about your preaching on the Green, Dinah; it\xe2\x80\x99s you must answer\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, for I\xe2\x80\x99m dumb. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said enough a\xe2\x80\x99ready about your bringing such\r\ndisgrace upo\xe2\x80\x99 your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s family. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 minded if you\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nMr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s own niece\xe2\x80\x94folks must put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 their own kin, as they put\r\nup wi\xe2\x80\x99 their own noses\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s their own flesh and blood. But to think of\r\na niece o\xe2\x80\x99 mine being cause o\xe2\x80\x99 my husband\xe2\x80\x99s being turned out of his\r\nfarm, and me brought him no fortin but my savin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, dear Aunt Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah gently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve no cause for such\r\nfears. I\xe2\x80\x99ve strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my\r\nuncle and the children from anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve done. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t preach without\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirection! I know very well what you mean by direction,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPoyser, knitting in a rapid and agitated manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger\r\nmaggot than usual in your head you call it \xe2\x80\x98direction\xe2\x80\x99; and then\r\nnothing can stir you\xe2\x80\x94you look like the statty o\xe2\x80\x99 the outside o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTreddles\xe2\x80\x99on church, a-starin\xe2\x80\x99 and a-smilin\xe2\x80\x99 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fair weather\r\nor foul. I hanna common patience with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down\r\nfrom their horses: it was plain they meant to come in. Mrs. Poyser\r\nadvanced to the door to meet them, curtsying low and trembling between\r\nanger with Dinah and anxiety to conduct herself with perfect propriety\r\non the occasion. For in those days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a\r\nwhispering awe at the sight of the gentry, such as of old men felt when\r\nthey stood on tiptoe to watch the gods passing by in tall human shape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nIrwine, with his stately cordiality. \xe2\x80\x9cOur feet are quite dry; we shall\r\nnot soil your beautiful floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you and the\r\ncaptain please to walk into the parlour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, looking eagerly\r\nround the kitchen, as if his eye were seeking something it could not\r\nfind. \xe2\x80\x9cI delight in your kitchen. I think it is the most charming room\r\nI know. I should like every farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife to come and look at it for a\r\npattern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPoyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s evident\r\ngood-humour, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine, who, she saw,\r\nwas looking at Dinah and advancing towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoyser is not at home, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne, seating\r\nhimself where he could see along the short passage to the open\r\ndairy-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t; he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor,\r\nabout the wool. But there\xe2\x80\x99s Father i\xe2\x80\x99 the barn, sir, if he\xe2\x80\x99d be of any\r\nuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll just look at the whelps and leave a message about\r\nthem with your shepherd. I must come another day and see your husband;\r\nI want to have a consultation with him about horses. Do you know when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be at liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, you can hardly miss him, except it\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99 Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on\r\nmarket-day\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s of a Friday, you know. For if he\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere on the\r\nfarm we can send for him in a minute. If we\xe2\x80\x99d got rid o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nScantlands, we should have no outlying fields; and I should be glad of\r\nit, for if ever anything happens, he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be gone to the\r\nScantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if they\xe2\x80\x99ve a chance; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s an unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral thing to have one bit o\xe2\x80\x99 your farm in one county and\r\nall the rest in another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce\xe2\x80\x99s farm, especially\r\nas he wants dairyland and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty. I think yours is the\r\nprettiest farm on the estate, though; and do you know, Mrs. Poyser, if\r\nI were going to marry and settle, I should be tempted to turn you out,\r\nand do up this fine old house, and turn farmer myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it at\r\nall. As for farming, it\xe2\x80\x99s putting money into your pocket wi\xe2\x80\x99 your right\r\nhand and fetching it out wi\xe2\x80\x99 your left. As fur as I can see, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nraising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for\r\nyourself and your children as you go along. Not as you\xe2\x80\x99d be like a poor\r\nman as wants to get his bread\xe2\x80\x94you could afford to lose as much money as\r\nyou liked i\xe2\x80\x99 farming\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s poor fun losing money, I should think,\r\nthough I understan\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s what the great folks i\xe2\x80\x99 London play at more\r\nthan anything. For my husband heard at market as Lord Dacey\xe2\x80\x99s eldest\r\nson had lost thousands upo\xe2\x80\x99 thousands to the Prince o\xe2\x80\x99 Wales, and they\r\nsaid my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him. But you know\r\nmore about that than I do, sir. But, as for farming, sir, I canna think\r\nas you\xe2\x80\x99d like it; and this house\xe2\x80\x94the draughts in it are enough to cut\r\nyou through, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten,\r\nand the rats i\xe2\x80\x99 the cellar are beyond anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should be doing\r\nyou a service to turn you out of such a place. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of\r\nthat. I\xe2\x80\x99m not likely to settle for the next twenty years, till I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nstout gentleman of forty; and my grandfather would never consent to\r\npart with such good tenants as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, if he thinks so well o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish you\r\ncould put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five\r\ncloses, for my husband\xe2\x80\x99s been asking and asking till he\xe2\x80\x99s tired, and to\r\nthink o\xe2\x80\x99 what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for the farm, and\xe2\x80\x99s never had a penny allowed\r\nhim, be the times bad or good. And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to my husband often and\r\noften, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if the captain had anything to do with it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe so. Not as I wish to speak disrespectful o\xe2\x80\x99 them as have got the\r\npower i\xe2\x80\x99 their hands, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more than flesh and blood \xe2\x80\x99ull bear\r\nsometimes, to be toiling and striving, and up early and down late, and\r\nhardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the cheese may\r\nswell, or the cows may slip their calf, or the wheat may grow green\r\nagain i\xe2\x80\x99 the sheaf\xe2\x80\x94and after all, at th\xe2\x80\x99 end o\xe2\x80\x99 the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s like as\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your\r\npains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed along\r\nwithout any check from her preliminary awe of the gentry. The\r\nconfidence she felt in her own powers of exposition was a motive force\r\nthat overcame all resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to speak\r\nabout the gates, Mrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I assure you\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your\r\nhusband. I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten\r\nmiles of us; and as for the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve there\xe2\x80\x99s one in the kingdom to beat it. By the by, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nseen your dairy: I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poyser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fit for you to go in, for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s in the middle\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 making the butter, for the churning was thrown late, and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite\r\nashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and believing that the\r\ncaptain was really interested in her milk-pans, and would adjust his\r\nopinion of her to the appearance of her dairy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s in capital order. Take me in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptain, himself leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\nThe Dairy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dairy was certainly worth looking at: it was a scene to sicken for\r\nwith a sort of calenture in hot and dusty streets\xe2\x80\x94such coolness, such\r\npurity, such fresh fragrance of new-pressed cheese, of firm butter, of\r\nwooden vessels perpetually bathed in pure water; such soft colouring of\r\nred earthenware and creamy surfaces, brown wood and polished tin, grey\r\nlimestone and rich orange-red rust on the iron weights and hooks and\r\nhinges. But one gets only a confused notion of these details when they\r\nsurround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen, standing on little\r\npattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a pound of butter out of\r\nthe scale.\r\n\r\nHetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne entered the\r\ndairy and spoke to her; but it was not at all a distressed blush, for\r\nit was inwreathed with smiles and dimples, and with sparkles from under\r\nlong, curled, dark eyelashes; and while her aunt was discoursing to him\r\nabout the limited amount of milk that was to be spared for butter and\r\ncheese so long as the calves were not all weaned, and a large quantity\r\nbut inferior quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn, which had been\r\nbought on experiment, together with other matters which must be\r\ninteresting to a young gentleman who would one day be a landlord, Hetty\r\ntossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a self-possessed,\r\ncoquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her head was lost.\r\n\r\nThere are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools of\r\nthemselves in various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish; but\r\nthere is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not\r\nonly of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a\r\nbeauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle\r\nrippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to\r\ntoddle and to engage in conscious mischief\xe2\x80\x94a beauty with which you can\r\nnever be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to\r\ncomprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas that sort of beauty. Her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, who professed to\r\ndespise all personal attractions and intended to be the severest of\r\nmentors, continually gazed at Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s charms by the sly, fascinated in\r\nspite of herself; and after administering such a scolding as naturally\r\nflowed from her anxiety to do well by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s niece\xe2\x80\x94who had no\r\nmother of her own to scold her, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x94she would often confess to\r\nher husband, when they were safe out of hearing, that she firmly\r\nbelieved, \xe2\x80\x9cthe naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the prettier she\r\nlooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s cheek was like a\r\nrose-petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large\r\ndark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her\r\ncurly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at\r\nwork, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her\r\nwhite shell-like ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was\r\nthe contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low\r\nplum-coloured stuff bodice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with\r\nits bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it\r\nfell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled\r\nbuckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have\r\nhad when empty of her foot and ankle\xe2\x80\x94of little use, unless you have\r\nseen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for\r\notherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she\r\nwould not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden. I\r\nmight mention all the divine charms of a bright spring day, but if you\r\nhad never in your life utterly forgotten yourself in straining your\r\neyes after the mounting lark, or in wandering through the still lanes\r\nwhen the fresh-opened blossoms fill them with a sacred silent beauty\r\nlike that of fretted aisles, where would be the use of my descriptive\r\ncatalogue? I could never make you know what I meant by a bright spring\r\nday. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young\r\nfrisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false\r\nair of innocence\xe2\x80\x94the innocence of a young star-browed calf, for\r\nexample, that, being inclined for a promenade out of bounds, leads you\r\na severe steeplechase over hedge and ditch, and only comes to a stand\r\nin the middle of a bog.\r\n\r\nAnd they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty\r\ngirl is thrown in making up butter\xe2\x80\x94tossing movements that give a\r\ncharming curve to the arm, and a sideward inclination of the round\r\nwhite neck; little patting and rolling movements with the palm of the\r\nhand, and nice adaptations and finishings which cannot at all be\r\neffected without a great play of the pouting mouth and the dark eyes.\r\nAnd then the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charm\xe2\x80\x94it is so\r\npure, so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with such a\r\nbeautiful firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover,\r\nHetty was particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one\r\nperformance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe\r\ncriticism; so she handled it with all the grace that belongs to\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July,\r\nMrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne, when he had sufficiently\r\nadmired the dairy and given several improvised opinions on Swede\r\nturnips and shorthorns. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what is to happen then, and I shall\r\nexpect you to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest.\r\nWill you promise me your hand for two dances, Miss Hetty? If I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget your promise now, I know I shall hardly have a chance, for all the\r\nsmart young farmers will take care to secure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty smiled and blushed, but before she could answer, Mrs. Poyser\r\ninterposed, scandalized at the mere suggestion that the young squire\r\ncould be excluded by any meaner partners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, you are very kind to take that notice of her. And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure, whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to dance with her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be proud and\r\nthankful, if she stood still all the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no, that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who\r\ncan dance. But you will promise me two dances, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d the captain\r\ncontinued, determined to make Hetty look at him and speak to him.\r\n\r\nHetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy, and stole a half-shy,\r\nhalf-coquettish glance at him as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser; your\r\nlittle Totty, as well as the boys. I want all the youngest children on\r\nthe estate to be there\xe2\x80\x94all those who will be fine young men and women\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m a bald old fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, sir, that \xe2\x80\x99ull be a long time first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, quite\r\novercome at the young squire\xe2\x80\x99s speaking so lightly of himself, and\r\nthinking how her husband would be interested in hearing her recount\r\nthis remarkable specimen of high-born humour. The captain was thought\r\nto be \xe2\x80\x9cvery full of his jokes,\xe2\x80\x9d and was a great favourite throughout\r\nthe estate on account of his free manners. Every tenant was quite sure\r\nthings would be different when the reins got into his hands\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nto be a millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of lime, and\r\nreturns of ten per cent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where _is_ Totty to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the little un, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cShe came in here\r\nnot long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her Totty,\r\npassed at once into the back kitchen, in search of her, not, however,\r\nwithout misgivings lest something should have happened to render her\r\nperson and attire unfit for presentation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you carry the butter to market when you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain to Hetty, meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, sir; not when it\xe2\x80\x99s so heavy. I\xe2\x80\x99m not strong enough to carry it.\r\nAlick takes it on horseback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your pretty arms were never meant for such heavy weights.\r\nBut you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you have a walk in the Chase sometimes, now it\xe2\x80\x99s so green and\r\npleasant? I hardly ever see you anywhere except at home and at church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to go a-walking only when I\xe2\x80\x99m going somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hetty. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I go through the Chase sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever go to see Mrs. Best, the housekeeper? I think I saw\r\nyou once in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Best, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Pomfret, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, as I go to\r\nsee. She\xe2\x80\x99s teaching me tent-stitch and the lace-mending. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ntea with her to-morrow afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reason why there had been space for this _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ can only be\r\nknown by looking into the back kitchen, where Totty had been discovered\r\nrubbing a stray blue-bag against her nose, and in the same moment\r\nallowing some liberal indigo drops to fall on her afternoon pinafore.\r\nBut now she appeared holding her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand\xe2\x80\x94the end of her round\r\nnose rather shiny from a recent and hurried application of soap and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, lifting her up and setting her on the\r\nlow stone shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Totty! By the by, what\xe2\x80\x99s her other name? She\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t christened Totty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, we call her sadly out of her name. Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s her christened\r\nname. It\xe2\x80\x99s a name i\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s family: his grandmother was named\r\nCharlotte. But we began with calling her Lotty, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s got to\r\nTotty. To be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a name for a dog than a Christian\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTotty\xe2\x80\x99s a capital name. Why, she looks like a Totty. Has she got a\r\npocket on?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, feeling in his own waistcoat pockets.\r\n\r\nTotty immediately with great gravity lifted up her frock, and showed a\r\ntiny pink pocket at present in a state of collapse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt dot notin\xe2\x80\x99 in it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she looked down at it very\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! What a pity! Such a pretty pocket. Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some\r\nthings in mine that will make a pretty jingle in it. Yes! I declare\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got five little round silver things, and hear what a pretty noise\r\nthey make in Totty\xe2\x80\x99s pink pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he shook the pocket with the\r\nfive sixpences in it, and Totty showed her teeth and wrinkled her nose\r\nin great glee; but, divining that there was nothing more to be got by\r\nstaying, she jumped off the shelf and ran away to jingle her pocket in\r\nthe hearing of Nancy, while her mother called after her, \xe2\x80\x9cOh for shame,\r\nyou naughty gell! Not to thank the captain for what he\xe2\x80\x99s given you I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you; but she\xe2\x80\x99s spoiled shameful; her\r\nfather won\xe2\x80\x99t have her said nay in anything, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no managing\r\nher. It\xe2\x80\x99s being the youngest, and th\xe2\x80\x99 only gell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a funny little fatty; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her different. But I\r\nmust be going now, for I suppose the rector is waiting for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d a bright glance, and a bow to Hetty Arthur left the\r\ndairy. But he was mistaken in imagining himself waited for. The rector\r\nhad been so much interested in his conversation with Dinah that he\r\nwould not have chosen to close it earlier; and you shall hear now what\r\nthey had been saying to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\nA Vocation\r\n\r\n\r\nDinah, who had risen when the gentlemen came in, but still kept hold of\r\nthe sheet she was mending, curtsied respectfully when she saw Mr.\r\nIrwine looking at her and advancing towards her. He had never yet\r\nspoken to her, or stood face to face with her, and her first thought,\r\nas her eyes met his, was, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a well-favoured countenance! Oh that\r\nthe good seed might fall on that soil, for it would surely flourish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe agreeable impression must have been mutual, for Mr. Irwine bowed to\r\nher with a benignant deference, which would have been equally in place\r\nif she had been the most dignified lady of his acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are only a visitor in this neighbourhood, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d were his first\r\nwords, as he seated himself opposite to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I come from Snowfield, in Stonyshire. But my aunt was very\r\nkind, wanting me to have rest from my work there, because I\xe2\x80\x99d been ill,\r\nand she invited me to come and stay with her for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I remember Snowfield very well; I once had occasion to go there.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dreary bleak place. They were building a cotton-mill there; but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s many years ago now. I suppose the place is a good deal changed\r\nby the employment that mill must have brought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ changed so far as the mill has brought people there, who get a\r\nlivelihood for themselves by working in it, and make it better for the\r\ntradesfolks. I work in it myself, and have reason to be grateful, for\r\nthereby I have enough and to spare. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still a bleak place, as\r\nyou say, sir\xe2\x80\x94very different from this country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have relations living there, probably, so that you are attached to\r\nthe place as your home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an aunt there once; she brought me up, for I was an orphan. But\r\nshe was taken away seven years ago, and I have no other kindred that I\r\nknow of, besides my Aunt Poyser, who is very good to me, and would have\r\nme come and live in this country, which to be sure is a good land,\r\nwherein they eat bread without scarceness. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not free to leave\r\nSnowfield, where I was first planted, and have grown deep into it, like\r\nthe small grass on the hill-top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there;\r\nyou are a Methodist\xe2\x80\x94a Wesleyan, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society, and I have cause to\r\nbe thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest\r\nchildhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you been long in the habit of preaching? For I understand you\r\npreached at Hayslope last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI first took to the work four years since, when I was twenty-one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Society sanctions women\xe2\x80\x99s preaching, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t forbid them, sir, when they\xe2\x80\x99ve a clear call to the work,\r\nand when their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the\r\nstrengthening of God\xe2\x80\x99s people. Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard\r\nabout, was the first woman to preach in the Society, I believe, before\r\nshe was married, when she was Miss Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved\r\nof her undertaking the work. She had a great gift, and there are many\r\nothers now living who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the\r\nministry. I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s been voices raised against it in the\r\nSociety of late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to\r\nnought. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t for men to make channels for God\xe2\x80\x99s Spirit, as they\r\nmake channels for the watercourses, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Flow here, but flow not\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you find some danger among your people\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say\r\nthat it is so with you, far from it\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t you find sometimes that\r\nboth men and women fancy themselves channels for God\xe2\x80\x99s Spirit, and are\r\nquite mistaken, so that they set about a work for which they are unfit\r\nand bring holy things into contempt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers among us\r\nwho have sought to deceive the brethren, and some there are who deceive\r\ntheir own selves. But we are not without discipline and correction to\r\nput a check upon these things. There\xe2\x80\x99s a very strict order kept among\r\nus, and the brethren and sisters watch for each other\xe2\x80\x99s souls as they\r\nthat must give account. They don\xe2\x80\x99t go every one his own way and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I my brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me\xe2\x80\x94if I may ask, and I am really interested in knowing it\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nyou first came to think of preaching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d been used from the time I\r\nwas sixteen to talk to the little children, and teach them, and\r\nsometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class, and was much\r\ndrawn out in prayer with the sick. But I had felt no call to preach,\r\nfor when I\xe2\x80\x99m not greatly wrought upon, I\xe2\x80\x99m too much given to sit still\r\nand keep by myself. It seems as if I could sit silent all day long with\r\nthe thought of God overflowing my soul\xe2\x80\x94as the pebbles lie bathed in the\r\nWillow Brook. For thoughts are so great\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t they, sir? They seem to\r\nlie upon us like a deep flood; and it\xe2\x80\x99s my besetment to forget where I\r\nam and everything about me, and lose myself in thoughts that I could\r\ngive no account of, for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of\r\nthem in words. That was my way as long as I can remember; but sometimes\r\nit seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own, and words\r\nwere given to me that came out as the tears come, because our hearts\r\nare full and we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. And those were always times of great\r\nblessing, though I had never thought it could be so with me before a\r\ncongregation of people. But, sir, we are led on, like the little\r\nchildren, by a way that we know not. I was called to preach quite\r\nsuddenly, and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work\r\nthat was laid upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94just how it was, the very day you began\r\nto preach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe, who was an aged man,\r\none of the local preachers, all the way to Hetton-Deeps\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvillage where the people get their living by working in the lead-mines,\r\nand where there\xe2\x80\x99s no church nor preacher, but they live like sheep\r\nwithout a shepherd. It\xe2\x80\x99s better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we\r\nset out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and I had a\r\nwonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look\r\nsmaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you\r\nfeel the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton,\r\nbrother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of\r\nfalling, for he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and\r\npraying, and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as\r\ncarrying on his trade of linen-weaving. And when we got to the village,\r\nthe people were expecting him, for he\xe2\x80\x99d appointed the time and the\r\nplace when he was there before, and such of them as cared to hear the\r\nWord of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest,\r\nso as others might be drawn to come. But he felt as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nup to preach, and he was forced to lie down in the first of the\r\ncottages we came to. So I went to tell the people, thinking we\xe2\x80\x99d go\r\ninto one of the houses, and I would read and pray with them. But as I\r\npassed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at\r\nthe doors, and the hard looks of the men, who seemed to have their eyes\r\nno more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had\r\nbeen dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky, I felt a great movement\r\nin my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit\r\nentering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock of\r\npeople was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that was\r\nbuilt against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that were given\r\nto me abundantly. And they all came round me out of all the cottages,\r\nand many wept over their sins, and have since been joined to the Lord.\r\nThat was the beginning of my preaching, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve preached ever\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah had let her work fall during this narrative, which she uttered in\r\nher usual simple way, but with that sincere articulate, thrilling\r\ntreble by which she always mastered her audience. She stooped now to\r\ngather up her sewing, and then went on with it as before. Mr. Irwine\r\nwas deeply interested. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a miserable prig\r\nwho would act the pedagogue here: one might as well go and lecture the\r\ntrees for growing in their own shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youth\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou are a lovely young woman on whom men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are fixed?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no room for such feelings, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the people\r\never take notice about that. I think, sir, when God makes His presence\r\nfelt through us, we are like the burning bush: Moses never took any\r\nheed what sort of bush it was\xe2\x80\x94he only saw the brightness of the Lord.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve preached to as rough ignorant people as can be in the villages\r\nabout Snowfield\xe2\x80\x94men that looked very hard and wild\xe2\x80\x94but they never said\r\nan uncivil word to me, and often thanked me kindly as they made way for\r\nme to pass through the midst of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ I can believe\xe2\x80\x94that I can well believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine,\r\nemphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you think of your hearers last night, now?\r\nDid you find them quiet and attentive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them,\r\nexcept in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart\r\nyearned greatly, when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given\r\nup to folly and vanity. I had some private talk and prayer with her\r\nafterwards, and I trust her heart is touched. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that in\r\nthese villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green\r\npastures and the still waters, tilling the ground and tending the\r\ncattle, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strange deadness to the Word, as different as can be\r\nfrom the great towns, like Leeds, where I once went to visit a holy\r\nwoman who preaches there. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how rich is the harvest of\r\nsouls up those high-walled streets, where you seemed to walk as in a\r\nprison-yard, and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil. I\r\nthink maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so\r\ndark and weary, and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at\r\nease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, our farm-labourers are not easily roused. They take life\r\nalmost as slowly as the sheep and cows. But we have some intelligent\r\nworkmen about here. I daresay you know the Bedes; Seth Bede, by the by,\r\nis a Methodist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know Seth well, and his brother Adam a little. Seth is a\r\ngracious young man\xe2\x80\x94sincere and without offence; and Adam is like the\r\npatriarch Joseph, for his great skill and knowledge and the kindness he\r\nshows to his brother and his parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the trouble that has just happened to them?\r\nTheir father, Matthias Bede, was drowned in the Willow Brook last\r\nnight, not far from his own door. I\xe2\x80\x99m going now to see Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, their poor aged mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, dropping her hands and\r\nlooking before her with pitying eyes, as if she saw the object of her\r\nsympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will mourn heavily, for Seth has told me she\xe2\x80\x99s of an\r\nanxious, troubled heart. I must go and see if I can give her any help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she rose and was beginning to fold up her work, Captain Donnithorne,\r\nhaving exhausted all plausible pretexts for remaining among the\r\nmilk-pans, came out of the dairy, followed by Mrs. Poyser. Mr. Irwine\r\nnow rose also, and, advancing towards Dinah, held out his hand, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye. I hear you are going away soon; but this will not be\r\nthe last visit you will pay your aunt\xe2\x80\x94so we shall meet again, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties at rest,\r\nand her face was brighter than usual, as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked\r\nafter Mrs. Irwine and the Miss Irwines, sir; I hope they\xe2\x80\x99re as well as\r\nusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you, Mrs. Poyser, except that Miss Anne has one of her bad\r\nheadaches to-day. By the by, we all liked that nice cream-cheese you\r\nsent us\xe2\x80\x94my mother especially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad, indeed, sir. It is but seldom I make one, but I\r\nremembered Mrs. Irwine was fond of \xe2\x80\x99em. Please to give my duty to her,\r\nand to Miss Kate and Miss Anne. They\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to look at my\r\npoultry this long while, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some beautiful speckled chickens,\r\nblack and white, as Miss Kate might like to have some of amongst hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her; she must come and see them. Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nrector, mounting his horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust ride slowly on, Irwine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Donnithorne, mounting also.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll overtake you in three minutes. I\xe2\x80\x99m only going to speak to the\r\nshepherd about the whelps. Good-bye, Mrs. Poyser; tell your husband I\r\nshall come and have a long talk with him soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser curtsied duly, and watched the two horses until they had\r\ndisappeared from the yard, amidst great excitement on the part of the\r\npigs and the poultry, and under the furious indignation of the\r\nbull-dog, who performed a Pyrrhic dance, that every moment seemed to\r\nthreaten the breaking of his chain. Mrs. Poyser delighted in this noisy\r\nexit; it was a fresh assurance to her that the farm-yard was well\r\nguarded, and that no loiterers could enter unobserved; and it was not\r\nuntil the gate had closed behind the captain that she turned into the\r\nkitchen again, where Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand, waiting\r\nto speak to her aunt, before she set out for Lisbeth Bede\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, however, though she noticed the bonnet, deferred remarking\r\non it until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Irwine wasn\xe2\x80\x99t angry, then? What did he say to you, Dinah?\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he scold you for preaching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he was not at all angry; he was very friendly to me. I was quite\r\ndrawn out to speak to him; I hardly know how, for I had always thought\r\nof him as a worldly Sadducee. But his countenance is as pleasant as the\r\nmorning sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasant! and what else did y\xe2\x80\x99 expect to find him but pleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Poyser impatiently, resuming her knitting. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think his\r\ncountenance _is_ pleasant indeed! And him a gentleman born, and\xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\nmother like a picter. You may go the country round and not find such\r\nanother woman turned sixty-six. It\xe2\x80\x99s summat-like to see such a man as\r\nthat i\xe2\x80\x99 the desk of a Sunday! As I say to Poyser, it\xe2\x80\x99s like looking at\r\na full crop o\xe2\x80\x99 wheat, or a pasture with a fine dairy o\xe2\x80\x99 cows in it; it\r\nmakes you think the world\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable-like. But as for such creaturs\r\nas you Methodisses run after, I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon go to look at a lot o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbare-ribbed runts on a common. Fine folks they are to tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright, as look as if they\xe2\x80\x99d never tasted nothing better than\r\nbacon-sword and sour-cake i\xe2\x80\x99 their lives. But what did Mr. Irwine say\r\nto you about that fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick o\xe2\x80\x99 preaching on the Green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only said he\xe2\x80\x99d heard of it; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel any displeasure\r\nabout it. But, dear aunt, don\xe2\x80\x99t think any more about that. He told me\r\nsomething that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will cause you sorrow, as it does me. Thias\r\nBede was drowned last night in the Willow Brook, and I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that\r\nthe aged mother will be greatly in need of comfort. Perhaps I can be of\r\nuse to her, so I have fetched my bonnet and am going to set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart, dear heart! But you must have a cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea first, child,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Poyser, falling at once from the key of B with five sharps to\r\nthe frank and genial C. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kettle\xe2\x80\x99s boiling\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it ready in a\r\nminute; and the young uns \xe2\x80\x99ull be in and wanting theirs directly. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite willing you should go and see th\xe2\x80\x99 old woman, for you\xe2\x80\x99re one as is\r\nallays welcome in trouble, Methodist or no Methodist; but, for the\r\nmatter o\xe2\x80\x99 that, it\xe2\x80\x99s the flesh and blood folks are made on as makes the\r\ndifference. Some cheeses are made o\xe2\x80\x99 skimmed milk and some o\xe2\x80\x99 new milk,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter what you call \xe2\x80\x99em, you may tell which is which by\r\nthe look and the smell. But as to Thias Bede, he\xe2\x80\x99s better out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nway nor in\xe2\x80\x94God forgi\xe2\x80\x99 me for saying so\xe2\x80\x94for he\xe2\x80\x99s done little this ten\r\nyear but make trouble for them as belonged to him; and I think it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe well for you to take a little bottle o\xe2\x80\x99 rum for th\xe2\x80\x99 old woman, for I\r\ndaresay she\xe2\x80\x99s got never a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing to comfort her inside. Sit\r\ndown, child, and be easy, for you shan\xe2\x80\x99t stir out till you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a cup\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 tea, and so I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of this speech, Mrs. Poyser had been reaching\r\ndown the tea-things from the shelves, and was on her way towards the\r\npantry for the loaf (followed close by Totty, who had made her\r\nappearance on the rattling of the tea-cups), when Hetty came out of the\r\ndairy relieving her tired arms by lifting them up, and clasping her\r\nhands at the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMolly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rather languidly, \xe2\x80\x9cjust run out and get me a bunch\r\nof dock-leaves: the butter\xe2\x80\x99s ready to pack up now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99 you hear what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; how should I hear anything?\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in a pettish tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as you\xe2\x80\x99d care much, I daresay, if you did hear; for you\xe2\x80\x99re too\r\nfeather-headed to mind if everybody was dead, so as you could stay\r\nupstairs a-dressing yourself for two hours by the clock. But anybody\r\nbesides yourself \xe2\x80\x99ud mind about such things happening to them as think\r\na deal more of you than you deserve. But Adam Bede and all his kin\r\nmight be drownded for what you\xe2\x80\x99d care\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d be perking at the glass the\r\nnext minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam Bede\xe2\x80\x94drowned?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, letting her arms fall and looking\r\nrather bewildered, but suspecting that her aunt was as usual\r\nexaggerating with a didactic purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah kindly, for Mrs. Poyser had passed on to\r\nthe pantry without deigning more precise information. \xe2\x80\x9cNot Adam. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, the old man, is drowned. He was drowned last night in the\r\nWillow Brook. Mr. Irwine has just told me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, looking serious, but not deeply\r\naffected; and as Molly now entered with the dock-leaves, she took them\r\nsilently and returned to the dairy without asking further questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s World\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile she adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale fragrant\r\nbutter as the primrose is set off by its nest of green I am afraid\r\nHetty was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne\r\nhad cast at her than of Adam and his troubles. Bright, admiring glances\r\nfrom a handsome young gentleman with white hands, a gold chain,\r\noccasional regimentals, and wealth and grandeur immeasurable\xe2\x80\x94those were\r\nthe warm rays that set poor Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s heart vibrating and playing its\r\nlittle foolish tunes over and over again. We do not hear that Memnon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstatue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the mightiest\r\nwind, or in response to any other influence divine or human than\r\ncertain short-lived sunbeams of morning; and we must learn to\r\naccommodate ourselves to the discovery that some of those cunningly\r\nfashioned instruments called human souls have only a very limited range\r\nof music, and will not vibrate in the least under a touch that fills\r\nothers with tremulous rapture or quivering agony.\r\n\r\nHetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her.\r\nShe was not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of Broxton came\r\nto Hayslope Church on a Sunday afternoon on purpose that he might see\r\nher; and that he would have made much more decided advances if her\r\nuncle Poyser, thinking but lightly of a young man whose father\xe2\x80\x99s land\r\nwas so foul as old Luke Britton\xe2\x80\x99s, had not forbidden her aunt to\r\nencourage him by any civilities. She was aware, too, that Mr. Craig,\r\nthe gardener at the Chase, was over head and ears in love with her, and\r\nhad lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and\r\nhyperbolical peas. She knew still better, that Adam Bede\xe2\x80\x94tall, upright,\r\nclever, brave Adam Bede\xe2\x80\x94who carried such authority with all the people\r\nround about, and whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an\r\nevening, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cAdam knew a fine sight more o\xe2\x80\x99 the natur o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings than those as thought themselves his betters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she knew that this\r\nAdam, who was often rather stern to other people and not much given to\r\nrun after the lasses, could be made to turn pale or red any day by a\r\nword or a look from her. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s sphere of comparison was not large,\r\nbut she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help perceiving that Adam was \xe2\x80\x9csomething like\xe2\x80\x9d a man;\r\nalways knew what to say about things, could tell her uncle how to prop\r\nthe hovel, and had mended the churn in no time; knew, with only looking\r\nat it, the value of the chestnut-tree that was blown down, and why the\r\ndamp came in the walls, and what they must do to stop the rats; and\r\nwrote a beautiful hand that you could read off, and could do figures in\r\nhis head\xe2\x80\x94a degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest\r\nfarmers of that countryside. Not at all like that slouching Luke\r\nBritton, who, when she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to\r\nHayslope, had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose had\r\nbegun to lay. And as for Mr. Craig, the gardener, he was a sensible man\r\nenough, to be sure, but he was knock-kneed, and had a queer sort of\r\nsing-song in his talk; moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he\r\nmust be far on the way to forty.\r\n\r\nHetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and\r\nwould be pleased for her to marry him. For those were times when there\r\nwas no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable\r\nartisan, and on the home hearth, as well as in the public house, they\r\nmight be seen taking their jug of ale together; the farmer having a\r\nlatent sense of capital, and of weight in parish affairs, which\r\nsustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation. Martin\r\nPoyser was not a frequenter of public houses, but he liked a friendly\r\nchat over his own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay down\r\nthe law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of\r\nhis farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a\r\nclever fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94ever since he had superintended the building of the new barn\xe2\x80\x94Adam\r\nhad always been made welcome at the Hall Farm, especially of a winter\r\nevening, when the whole family, in patriarchal fashion, master and\r\nmistress, children and servants, were assembled in that glorious\r\nkitchen, at well-graduated distances from the blazing fire. And for the\r\nlast two years, at least, Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her\r\nuncle say, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam Bede may be working for wage now, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nmaster-man some day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is in\r\nthe right on\xe2\x80\x99t to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s true what they say; the woman as marries him \xe2\x80\x99ull have a good\r\ntake, be\xe2\x80\x99t Lady day or Michaelmas,\xe2\x80\x9d a remark which Mrs. Poyser always\r\nfollowed up with her cordial assent. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nvery fine having a ready-made rich man, but mayhappen he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nready-made fool; and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use filling your pocket full o\xe2\x80\x99 money if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hole in the corner. It\xe2\x80\x99ll do you no good to sit in a\r\nspring-cart o\xe2\x80\x99 your own, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a soft to drive you: he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nturn you over into the ditch. I allays said I\xe2\x80\x99d never marry a man as\r\nhad got no brains; for where\xe2\x80\x99s the use of a woman having brains of her\r\nown if she\xe2\x80\x99s tackled to a geck as everybody\xe2\x80\x99s a-laughing at? She might\r\nas well dress herself fine to sit back\xe2\x80\x99ards on a donkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the bent\r\nof Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s mind with regard to Adam; and though she and her\r\nhusband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a\r\ndaughter of their own, it was clear that they would have welcomed the\r\nmatch with Adam for a penniless niece. For what could Hetty have been\r\nbut a servant elsewhere, if her uncle had not taken her in and brought\r\nher up as a domestic help to her aunt, whose health since the birth of\r\nTotty had not been equal to more positive labour than the\r\nsuperintendence of servants and children? But Hetty had never given\r\nAdam any steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she was most\r\nthoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers, she had\r\nnever brought herself to think of accepting him. She liked to feel that\r\nthis strong, skilful, keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have\r\nbeen indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under\r\nthe yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle\r\nMary Burge, who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling\r\nnotice from him. \xe2\x80\x9cMary Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she\r\nput on a bit of pink ribbon, she looked as yellow as a crow-flower and\r\nher hair was as straight as a hank of cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d And always when Adam\r\nstayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made\r\nsome show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one, Hetty took\r\ncare to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and\r\ntimidity, as if she were in trouble at his neglect. But as to marrying\r\nAdam, that was a very different affair! There was nothing in the world\r\nto tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his\r\nname was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along\r\nthe causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly in\r\nthe footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested\r\non her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not\r\ncare to look at Mary Burge. He could no more stir in her the emotions\r\nthat make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of\r\na sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She\r\nsaw him as he was\xe2\x80\x94a poor man with old parents to keep, who would not be\r\nable, for a long while to come, to give her even such luxuries as she\r\nshared in her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house. And Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s dreams were all of luxuries:\r\nto sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear white stockings; to have\r\nsome large beautiful ear-rings, such as were all the fashion; to have\r\nNottingham lace round the top of her gown, and something to make her\r\nhandkerchief smell nice, like Miss Lydia Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s when she drew it\r\nout at church; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by\r\nanybody. She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her\r\nthese things, she loved him well enough to marry him.\r\n\r\nBut for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty\xe2\x80\x94vague,\r\natmospheric, shaping itself into no self-confessed hopes or prospects,\r\nbut producing a pleasant narcotic effect, making her tread the ground\r\nand go about her work in a sort of dream, unconscious of weight or\r\neffort, and showing her all things through a soft, liquid veil, as if\r\nshe were living not in this solid world of brick and stone, but in a\r\nbeatified world, such as the sun lights up for us in the waters. Hetty\r\nhad become aware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of\r\ntrouble for the chance of seeing her; that he always placed himself at\r\nchurch so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and standing;\r\nthat he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm, and\r\nalways would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak\r\nto him and look at him. The poor child no more conceived at present the\r\nidea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a baker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty daughter in the crowd, whom a young emperor distinguishes by an\r\nimperial but admiring smile, conceives that she shall be made empress.\r\nBut the baker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter goes home and dreams of the handsome young\r\nemperor, and perhaps weighs the flour amiss while she is thinking what\r\na heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband. And so, poor Hetty\r\nhad got a face and a presence haunting her waking and sleeping dreams;\r\nbright, soft glances had penetrated her, and suffused her life with a\r\nstrange, happy languor. The eyes that shed those glances were really\r\nnot half so fine as Adam\xe2\x80\x99s, which sometimes looked at her with a sad,\r\nbeseeching tenderness, but they had found a ready medium in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle silly imagination, whereas Adam\xe2\x80\x99s could get no entrance through\r\nthat atmosphere. For three weeks, at least, her inward life had\r\nconsisted of little else than living through in memory the looks and\r\nwords Arthur had directed towards her\xe2\x80\x94of little else than recalling the\r\nsensations with which she heard his voice outside the house, and saw\r\nhim enter, and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her, and\r\nthen became conscious that a tall figure, looking down on her with eyes\r\nthat seemed to touch her, was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful\r\ntexture with an odour like that of a flower-garden borne on the evening\r\nbreeze. Foolish thoughts! But all this happened, you must remember,\r\nnearly sixty years ago, and Hetty was quite uneducated\xe2\x80\x94a simple\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s girl, to whom a gentleman with a white hand was dazzling as an\r\nOlympian god. Until to-day, she had never looked farther into the\r\nfuture than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to the\r\nFarm, or the next Sunday when she should see him at church; but now she\r\nthought, perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94and if he should speak to her, and walk a little way, when\r\nnobody was by! That had never happened yet; and now her imagination,\r\ninstead of retracing the past, was busy fashioning what would happen\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94whereabout in the Chase she should see him coming towards\r\nher, how she should put her new rose-coloured ribbon on, which he had\r\nnever seen, and what he would say to her to make her return his\r\nglance\xe2\x80\x94a glance which she would be living through in her memory, over\r\nand over again, all the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind, how could Hetty give any feeling to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntroubles, or think much about poor old Thias being drowned? Young\r\nsouls, in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as\r\nbutterflies sipping nectar; they are isolated from all appeals by a\r\nbarrier of dreams\xe2\x80\x94by invisible looks and impalpable arms.\r\n\r\nWhile Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s hands were busy packing up the butter, and her head\r\nfilled with these pictures of the morrow, Arthur Donnithorne, riding by\r\nMr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s side towards the valley of the Willow Brook, had also\r\ncertain indistinct anticipations, running as an undercurrent in his\r\nmind while he was listening to Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s account of\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x94indistinct, yet strong enough to make him feel rather conscious\r\nwhen Mr. Irwine suddenly said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fascinated you so in Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndairy, Arthur? Have you become an amateur of damp quarries and skimming\r\ndishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention\r\nwould be of any use, so he said, with his accustomed frankness, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\nwent to look at the pretty butter-maker Hetty Sorrel. She\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect\r\nHebe; and if I were an artist, I would paint her. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what\r\npretty girls one sees among the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters, when the men are\r\nsuch clowns. That common, round, red face one sees sometimes in the\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94all cheek and no features, like Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94comes out in the\r\nwomen of the family as the most charming phiz imaginable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an artistic\r\nlight, but I must not have you feeding her vanity and filling her\r\nlittle noddle with the notion that she\xe2\x80\x99s a great beauty, attractive to\r\nfine gentlemen, or you will spoil her for a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94honest\r\nCraig\xe2\x80\x99s, for example, whom I have seen bestowing soft glances on her.\r\nThe little puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as\r\nmiserable as it\xe2\x80\x99s a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries\r\na beauty. Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam will get settled,\r\nnow the poor old man\xe2\x80\x99s gone. He will only have his mother to keep in\r\nfuture, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion that there\xe2\x80\x99s a kindness between him and that\r\nnice modest girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old\r\nJonathan one day when I was talking to him. But when I mentioned the\r\nsubject to Adam he looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose\r\nthe love-making doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back till\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s in a better position. He has independence of spirit enough for two\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94rather an excess of pride, if anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a capital match for Adam. He would slip into old Burge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoes and make a fine thing of that building business, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for\r\nhim. I should like to see him well settled in this parish; he would be\r\nready then to act as my grand-vizier when I wanted one. We could plan\r\nno end of repairs and improvements together. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen the girl,\r\nthough, I think\xe2\x80\x94at least I\xe2\x80\x99ve never looked at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her next Sunday at church\xe2\x80\x94she sits with her father on the left\r\nof the reading-desk. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite so much at Hetty Sorrel\r\nthen. When I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind that I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to buy a tempting\r\ndog, I take no notice of him, because if he took a strong fancy to me\r\nand looked lovingly at me, the struggle between arithmetic and\r\ninclination might become unpleasantly severe. I pique myself on my\r\nwisdom there, Arthur, and as an old fellow to whom wisdom had become\r\ncheap, I bestow it upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. It may stand me in good stead some day though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat I have any present use for it. Bless me! How the brook has\r\noverflowed. Suppose we have a canter, now we\xe2\x80\x99re at the bottom of the\r\nhill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback; it can be merged\r\nany minute into a trot or a canter, and one might have escaped from\r\nSocrates himself in the saddle. The two friends were free from the\r\nnecessity of further conversation till they pulled up in the lane\r\nbehind Adam\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\nDinah Visits Lisbeth\r\n\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in her hand:\r\nit was the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead. Throughout\r\nthe day, except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief, she had\r\nbeen in incessant movement, performing the initial duties to her dead\r\nwith the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites. She had\r\nbrought out her little store of bleached linen, which she had for long\r\nyears kept in reserve for this supreme use. It seemed but\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x94that time so many midsummers ago, when she had told Thias\r\nwhere this linen lay, that he might be sure and reach it out for her\r\nwhen _she_ died, for she was the elder of the two. Then there had been\r\nthe work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the\r\nsacred chamber, and of removing from it every trace of common daily\r\noccupation. The small window, which had hitherto freely let in the\r\nfrosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslumber, must now be darkened with a fair white sheet, for this was the\r\nsleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses.\r\nLisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable rent in the\r\ncheckered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious now\r\nin which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love\r\nfor the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some\r\nconsciousness. Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten\r\nthem: they can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our\r\npenitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the\r\nkisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence. And the aged\r\npeasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious. Decent\r\nburial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years\r\nof thrift, with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she\r\nwas being carried to the churchyard, followed by her husband and her\r\nsons; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be\r\ndone in seeing that Thias was buried decently before her\xe2\x80\x94under the\r\nwhite thorn, where once, in a dream, she had thought she lay in the\r\ncoffin, yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white\r\nblossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be\r\nchurched after Adam was born.\r\n\r\nBut now she had done everything that could be done to-day in the\r\nchamber of death\xe2\x80\x94had done it all herself, with some aid from her sons\r\nin lifting, for she would let no one be fetched to help her from the\r\nvillage, not being fond of female neighbours generally; and her\r\nfavourite Dolly, the old housekeeper at Mr. Burge\xe2\x80\x99s, who had come to\r\ncondole with her in the morning as soon as she heard of Thias\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nwas too dim-sighted to be of much use. She had locked the door, and now\r\nheld the key in her hand, as she threw herself wearily into a chair\r\nthat stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor, where in\r\nordinary times she would never have consented to sit. The kitchen had\r\nhad none of her attention that day; it was soiled with the tread of\r\nmuddy shoes and untidy with clothes and other objects out of place. But\r\nwhat at another time would have been intolerable to Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s habits of\r\norder and cleanliness seemed to her now just what should be: it was\r\nright that things should look strange and disordered and wretched, now\r\nthe old man had come to his end in that sad way; the kitchen ought not\r\nto look as if nothing had happened. Adam, overcome with the agitations\r\nand exertions of the day after his night of hard work, had fallen\r\nasleep on a bench in the workshop; and Seth was in the back kitchen\r\nmaking a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil, and\r\npersuade his mother to have a cup of tea, an indulgence which she\r\nrarely allowed herself.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself\r\ninto the chair. She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and\r\nconfusion on which the bright afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s sun shone dismally; it was\r\nall of a piece with the sad confusion of her mind\xe2\x80\x94that confusion which\r\nbelongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow, when the poor human soul\r\nis like one who has been deposited sleeping among the ruins of a vast\r\ncity, and wakes up in dreary amazement, not knowing whether it is the\r\ngrowing or the dying day\xe2\x80\x94not knowing why and whence came this\r\nillimitable scene of desolation, or why he too finds himself desolate\r\nin the midst of it.\r\n\r\nAt another time Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s first thought would have been, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nAdam?\xe2\x80\x9d but the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these\r\nhours to that first place in her affections which he had held\r\nsix-and-twenty years ago. She had forgotten his faults as we forget the\r\nsorrows of our departed childhood, and thought of nothing but the young\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s kindness and the old man\xe2\x80\x99s patience. Her eyes continued to\r\nwander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove some of the\r\nscattered things, and clear the small round deal table that he might\r\nset out his mother\xe2\x80\x99s tea upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rather peevishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want thee to have a cup of tea, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Seth, tenderly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do thee good; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put two or three of these things away,\r\nand make the house look more comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComfortable! How canst talk o\xe2\x80\x99 ma\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 things comfortable? Let a-be,\r\nlet a-be. There\xe2\x80\x99s no comfort for me no more,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, the tears\r\ncoming when she began to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cnow thy poor feyther\xe2\x80\x99s gone, as I\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nwashed for and mended, an\xe2\x80\x99 got\xe2\x80\x99s victual for him for thirty \xe2\x80\x99ear, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhim allays so pleased wi\xe2\x80\x99 iverything I done for him, an\xe2\x80\x99 used to be so\r\nhandy an\xe2\x80\x99 do the jobs for me when I war ill an\xe2\x80\x99 cumbered wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 babby,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 made me the posset an\xe2\x80\x99 brought it upstairs as proud as could be,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 carried the lad as war as heavy as two children for five mile an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nne\xe2\x80\x99er grumbled, all the way to Warson Wake, \xe2\x80\x99cause I wanted to go an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsee my sister, as war dead an\xe2\x80\x99 gone the very next Christmas as e\xe2\x80\x99er\r\ncome. An\xe2\x80\x99 him to be drownded in the brook as we passed o\xe2\x80\x99er the day we\r\nwar married an\xe2\x80\x99 come home together, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99d made them lots o\xe2\x80\x99 shelves\r\nfor me to put my plates an\xe2\x80\x99 things on, an\xe2\x80\x99 showed \xe2\x80\x99em me as proud as\r\ncould be, \xe2\x80\x99cause he know\xe2\x80\x99d I should be pleased. An\xe2\x80\x99 he war to die an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme not to know, but to be a-sleepin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 my bed, as if I caredna nought\r\nabout it. Eh! An\xe2\x80\x99 me to live to see that! An\xe2\x80\x99 us as war young folks\r\nonce, an\xe2\x80\x99 thought we should do rarely when we war married. Let a-be,\r\nlad, let a-be! I wonna ha\xe2\x80\x99 no tay. I carena if I ne\xe2\x80\x99er ate nor drink no\r\nmore. When one end o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 bridge tumbles down, where\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 use o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nother stannin\xe2\x80\x99? I may\xe2\x80\x99s well die, an\xe2\x80\x99 foller my old man. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nknowin\xe2\x80\x99 but he\xe2\x80\x99ll want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Lisbeth broke from words into moans, swaying herself backwards and\r\nforwards on her chair. Seth, always timid in his behaviour towards his\r\nmother, from the sense that he had no influence over her, felt it was\r\nuseless to attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was\r\npast; so he contented himself with tending the back kitchen fire and\r\nfolding up his father\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, which had been hanging out to dry\r\nsince morning\xe2\x80\x94afraid to move about in the room where his mother was,\r\nlest he should irritate her further.\r\n\r\nBut after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some\r\nminutes, she suddenly paused and said aloud to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsee arter Adam, for I canna think where he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten; an\xe2\x80\x99 I want him to\r\ngo upstairs wi\xe2\x80\x99 me afore it\xe2\x80\x99s dark, for the minutes to look at the\r\ncorpse is like the meltin\xe2\x80\x99 snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth overheard this, and coming into the kitchen again, as his mother\r\nrose from her chair, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x99s asleep in the workshop, mother.\r\nThee\xe2\x80\x99dst better not wake him. He was o\xe2\x80\x99erwrought with work and\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake him? Who\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to wake him? I shanna wake him wi\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nhim. I hanna seen the lad this two hour\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d welly forgot as he\xe2\x80\x99d e\xe2\x80\x99er\r\ngrowed up from a babby when\xe2\x80\x99s feyther carried him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was seated on a rough bench, his head supported by his arm, which\r\nrested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing-table in the\r\nmiddle of the workshop. It seemed as if he had sat down for a few\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 rest and had fallen asleep without slipping from his first\r\nattitude of sad, fatigued thought. His face, unwashed since yesterday,\r\nlooked pallid and clammy; his hair was tossed shaggily about his\r\nforehead, and his closed eyes had the sunken look which follows upon\r\nwatching and sorrow. His brow was knit, and his whole face had an\r\nexpression of weariness and pain. Gyp was evidently uneasy, for he sat\r\non his haunches, resting his nose on his master\xe2\x80\x99s stretched-out leg,\r\nand dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly\r\ndown and glancing with a listening air towards the door. The poor dog\r\nwas hungry and restless, but would not leave his master, and was\r\nwaiting impatiently for some change in the scene. It was owing to this\r\nfeeling on Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s part that, when Lisbeth came into the workshop and\r\nadvanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she could, her intention not to\r\nawaken him was immediately defeated; for Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s excitement was too great\r\nto find vent in anything short of a sharp bark, and in a moment Adam\r\nopened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him. It was not very\r\nunlike his dream, for his sleep had been little more than living\r\nthrough again, in a fevered delirious way, all that had happened since\r\ndaybreak, and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him\r\nthrough it all. The chief difference between the reality and the vision\r\nwas that in his dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily\r\npresence\xe2\x80\x94strangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which\r\nshe had nothing to do. She was even by the Willow Brook; she made his\r\nmother angry by coming into the house; and he met her with her smart\r\nclothes quite wet through, as he walked in the rain to Treddleston, to\r\ntell the coroner. But wherever Hetty came, his mother was sure to\r\nfollow soon; and when he opened his eyes, it was not at all startling\r\nto see her standing near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my lad, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth burst out immediately, her wailing\r\nimpulse returning, for grief in its freshness feels the need of\r\nassociating its loss and its lament with every change of scene and\r\nincident, \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x99st got nobody now but thy old mother to torment thee\r\nand be a burden to thee. Thy poor feyther \xe2\x80\x99ull ne\xe2\x80\x99er anger thee no\r\nmore; an\xe2\x80\x99 thy mother may\xe2\x80\x99s well go arter him\xe2\x80\x94the sooner the better\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m no good to nobody now. One old coat \xe2\x80\x99ull do to patch another, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s good for nought else. Thee\xe2\x80\x99dst like to ha\xe2\x80\x99 a wife to mend thy\r\nclothes an\xe2\x80\x99 get thy victual, better nor thy old mother. An\xe2\x80\x99 I shall be\r\nnought but cumber, a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 chimney-corner. (Adam winced and\r\nmoved uneasily; he dreaded, of all things, to hear his mother speak of\r\nHetty.) But if thy feyther had lived, he\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er ha\xe2\x80\x99 wanted me to go to\r\nmake room for another, for he could no more ha\xe2\x80\x99 done wi\xe2\x80\x99out me nor one\r\nside o\xe2\x80\x99 the scissars can do wi\xe2\x80\x99out th\xe2\x80\x99 other. Eh, we should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nboth flung away together, an\xe2\x80\x99 then I shouldna ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen this day, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\none buryin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 done for us both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Lisbeth paused, but Adam sat in pained silence\xe2\x80\x94he could not speak\r\notherwise than tenderly to his mother to-day, but he could not help\r\nbeing irritated by this plaint. It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to\r\nknow how it affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded\r\ndog to know how his moans affect the nerves of his master. Like all\r\ncomplaining women, she complained in the expectation of being soothed,\r\nand when Adam said nothing, she was only prompted to complain more\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know thee couldst do better wi\xe2\x80\x99out me, for thee couldst go where\r\nthee likedst an\xe2\x80\x99 marry them as thee likedst. But I donna want to say\r\nthee nay, let thee bring home who thee wut; I\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er open my lips to\r\nfind faut, for when folks is old an\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 no use, they may think\r\ntheirsens well off to get the bit an\xe2\x80\x99 the sup, though they\xe2\x80\x99n to swallow\r\nill words wi\xe2\x80\x99t. An\xe2\x80\x99 if thee\xe2\x80\x99st set thy heart on a lass as\xe2\x80\x99ll bring thee\r\nnought and waste all, when thee mightst ha\xe2\x80\x99 them as \xe2\x80\x99ud make a man on\r\nthee, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say nought, now thy feyther\xe2\x80\x99s dead an\xe2\x80\x99 drownded, for I\xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nbetter nor an old haft when the blade\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, unable to bear this any longer, rose silently from the bench and\r\nwalked out of the workshop into the kitchen. But Lisbeth followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee wutna go upstairs an\xe2\x80\x99 see thy feyther then? I\xe2\x80\x99n done everythin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99d like thee to go an\xe2\x80\x99 look at him, for he war allays so\r\npleased when thee wast mild to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam turned round at once and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, mother; let us go upstairs.\r\nCome, Seth, let us go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs, and for five minutes all was silence. Then the key\r\nwas turned again, and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. But\r\nAdam did not come down again; he was too weary and worn-out to\r\nencounter more of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s querulous grief, and he went to rest on\r\nhis bed. Lisbeth no sooner entered the kitchen and sat down than she\r\nthrew her apron over her head, and began to cry and moan and rock\r\nherself as before. Seth thought, \xe2\x80\x9cShe will be quieter by and by, now we\r\nhave been upstairs\xe2\x80\x9d; and he went into the back kitchen again, to tend\r\nhis little fire, hoping that he should presently induce her to have\r\nsome tea.\r\n\r\nLisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five\r\nminutes, giving a low moan with every forward movement of her body,\r\nwhen she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers, and a sweet treble\r\nvoice said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cDear sister, the Lord has sent me to see if I can\r\nbe a comfort to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth paused, in a listening attitude, without removing her apron\r\nfrom her face. The voice was strange to her. Could it be her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirit come back to her from the dead after all those years? She\r\ntrembled and dared not look.\r\n\r\nDinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for\r\nthe sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took off her\r\nbonnet, and then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on hearing her voice,\r\nhad come in with a beating heart, laid one hand on the back of\r\nLisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s chair and leaned over her, that she might be aware of a\r\nfriendly presence.\r\n\r\nSlowly Lisbeth drew down her apron, and timidly she opened her dim dark\r\neyes. She saw nothing at first but a face\xe2\x80\x94a pure, pale face, with\r\nloving grey eyes, and it was quite unknown to her. Her wonder\r\nincreased; perhaps it _was_ an angel. But in the same instant Dinah had\r\nlaid her hand on Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s again, and the old woman looked down at it.\r\nIt was a much smaller hand than her own, but it was not white and\r\ndelicate, for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life, and her hand\r\nbore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards. Lisbeth looked\r\nearnestly at the hand for a moment, and then, fixing her eyes again on\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s face, said, with something of restored courage, but in a tone\r\nof surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ye\xe2\x80\x99re a workin\xe2\x80\x99 woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am Dinah Morris, and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth slowly, still wondering; \xe2\x80\x9cye comed in so light, like\r\nthe shadow on the wall, an\xe2\x80\x99 spoke i\xe2\x80\x99 my ear, as I thought ye might be a\r\nsperrit. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\xe2\x80\x99most the face o\xe2\x80\x99 one as is a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 on the grave\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 Adam\xe2\x80\x99s new Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from the Hall Farm now. You know Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s my aunt, and\r\nshe has heard of your great affliction, and is very sorry; and I\xe2\x80\x99m come\r\nto see if I can be any help to you in your trouble; for I know your\r\nsons Adam and Seth, and I know you have no daughter; and when the\r\nclergyman told me how the hand of God was heavy upon you, my heart went\r\nout towards you, and I felt a command to come and be to you in the\r\nplace of a daughter in this grief, if you will let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I know who y\xe2\x80\x99 are now; y\xe2\x80\x99 are a Methody, like Seth; he\xe2\x80\x99s tould me\r\non you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth fretfully, her overpowering sense of pain\r\nreturning, now her wonder was gone. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it out as trouble\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood thing, like _he_ allays does. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to me\r\na-that\xe2\x80\x99n? Ye canna make the smart less wi\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er make me\r\nbelieve as it\xe2\x80\x99s better for me not to ha\xe2\x80\x99 my old man die in\xe2\x80\x99s bed, if he\r\nmust die, an\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 the parson to pray by him, an\xe2\x80\x99 me to sit by him, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntell him ne\xe2\x80\x99er to mind th\xe2\x80\x99 ill words I\xe2\x80\x99ve gi\xe2\x80\x99en him sometimes when I\r\nwar angered, an\xe2\x80\x99 to gi\xe2\x80\x99 him a bit an\xe2\x80\x99 a sup, as long as a bit an\xe2\x80\x99 a sup\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d swallow. But eh! To die i\xe2\x80\x99 the cold water, an\xe2\x80\x99 us close to him,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 ne\xe2\x80\x99er to know; an\xe2\x80\x99 me a-sleepin\xe2\x80\x99, as if I ne\xe2\x80\x99er belonged to him no\r\nmore nor if he\xe2\x80\x99d been a journeyman tramp from nobody knows where!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again; and Dinah said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\ndear friend, your affliction is great. It would be hardness of heart to\r\nsay that your trouble was not heavy to bear. God didn\xe2\x80\x99t send me to you\r\nto make light of your sorrow, but to mourn with you, if you will let\r\nme. If you had a table spread for a feast, and was making merry with\r\nyour friends, you would think it was kind to let me come and sit down\r\nand rejoice with you, because you\xe2\x80\x99d think I should like to share those\r\ngood things; but I should like better to share in your trouble and your\r\nlabour, and it would seem harder to me if you denied me that. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsend me away? You\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me for coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay; angered! who said I war angered? It war good on you to come.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 Seth, why donna ye get her some tay? Ye war in a hurry to get some\r\nfor me, as had no need, but ye donna think o\xe2\x80\x99 gettin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99t for them as\r\nwants it. Sit ye down; sit ye down. I thank you kindly for comin\xe2\x80\x99, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s little wage ye get by walkin\xe2\x80\x99 through the wet fields to see an old\r\nwoman like me.... Nay, I\xe2\x80\x99n got no daughter o\xe2\x80\x99 my own\xe2\x80\x94ne\xe2\x80\x99er had one\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI warna sorry, for they\xe2\x80\x99re poor queechy things, gells is; I allays\r\nwanted to ha\xe2\x80\x99 lads, as could fend for theirsens. An\xe2\x80\x99 the lads \xe2\x80\x99ull be\r\nmarryin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I shall ha\xe2\x80\x99 daughters eno\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 too many. But now, do ye make\r\nthe tay as ye like it, for I\xe2\x80\x99n got no taste i\xe2\x80\x99 my mouth this day\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall one what I swaller\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all got the taste o\xe2\x80\x99 sorrow wi\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah took care not to betray that she had had her tea, and accepted\r\nLisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s invitation very readily, for the sake of persuading the old\r\nwoman herself to take the food and drink she so much needed after a day\r\nof hard work and fasting.\r\n\r\nSeth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he could not help\r\nthinking her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief\r\nincessantly followed upon grief; but the next moment he reproached\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94it was almost as if he were rejoicing in his father\xe2\x80\x99s sad\r\ndeath. Nevertheless the joy of being with Dinah _would_ triumph\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nlike the influence of climate, which no resistance can overcome. And\r\nthe feeling even suffused itself over his face so as to attract his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s notice, while she was drinking her tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee may\xe2\x80\x99st well talk o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble bein\xe2\x80\x99 a good thing, Seth, for thee\r\nthriv\xe2\x80\x99st on\xe2\x80\x99t. Thee look\xe2\x80\x99st as if thee know\xe2\x80\x99dst no more o\xe2\x80\x99 care an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncumber nor when thee wast a babby a-lyin\xe2\x80\x99 awake i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 cradle. For\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99dst allays lie still wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy eyes open, an\xe2\x80\x99 Adam ne\xe2\x80\x99er \xe2\x80\x99ud lie\r\nstill a minute when he wakened. Thee wast allays like a bag o\xe2\x80\x99 meal as\r\ncan ne\xe2\x80\x99er be bruised\xe2\x80\x94though, for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 that, thy poor feyther\r\nwar just such another. But _ye_\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same look too\xe2\x80\x9d (here Lisbeth\r\nturned to Dinah). \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s wi\xe2\x80\x99 bein\xe2\x80\x99 a Methody. Not as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-findin\xe2\x80\x99 faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye for\xe2\x80\x99t, for ye\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to be frettin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsomehow ye looken sorry too. Eh! Well, if the Methodies are fond o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrouble, they\xe2\x80\x99re like to thrive: it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity they canna ha\xe2\x80\x99t all, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntake it away from them as donna like it. I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 gi\xe2\x80\x99en \xe2\x80\x99em plenty;\r\nfor when I\xe2\x80\x99d gotten my old man I war worreted from morn till night; and\r\nnow he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad for the worst o\xe2\x80\x99er again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, careful not to oppose any feeling of Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s, for\r\nher reliance, in her smallest words and deeds, on a divine guidance,\r\nalways issued in that finest woman\xe2\x80\x99s tact which proceeds from acute and\r\nready sympathy; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, I remember too, when my dear aunt died, I longed\r\nfor the sound of her bad cough in the nights, instead of the silence\r\nthat came when she was gone. But now, dear friend, drink this other cup\r\nof tea and eat a little more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, taking the cup and speaking in a less querulous\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9chad ye got no feyther and mother, then, as ye war so sorry about\r\nyour aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never knew a father or mother; my aunt brought me up from a\r\nbaby. She had no children, for she was never married and she brought me\r\nup as tenderly as if I\xe2\x80\x99d been her own child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, she\xe2\x80\x99d fine work wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, bringin\xe2\x80\x99 ye up from a babby,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 her a lone woman\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s ill bringin\xe2\x80\x99 up a cade lamb. But I daresay ye\r\nwarna franzy, for ye look as if ye\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er been angered i\xe2\x80\x99 your life.\r\nBut what did ye do when your aunt died, an\xe2\x80\x99 why didna ye come to live\r\nin this country, bein\xe2\x80\x99 as Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s your aunt too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah, seeing that Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s attention was attracted, told her the\r\nstory of her early life\xe2\x80\x94how she had been brought up to work hard, and\r\nwhat sort of place Snowfield was, and how many people had a hard life\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94all the details that she thought likely to interest Lisbeth. The\r\nold woman listened, and forgot to be fretful, unconsciously subject to\r\nthe soothing influence of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face and voice. After a while she was\r\npersuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy; for Dinah was bent on this,\r\nbelieving that the sense of order and quietude around her would help in\r\ndisposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour forth at her\r\nside. Seth, meanwhile, went out to chop wood, for he surmised that\r\nDinah would like to be left alone with his mother.\r\n\r\nLisbeth sat watching her as she moved about in her still quick way, and\r\nsaid at last, \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a notion o\xe2\x80\x99 cleanin\xe2\x80\x99 up. I wouldna mind ha\xe2\x80\x99in\r\nye for a daughter, for ye wouldna spend the lad\xe2\x80\x99s wage i\xe2\x80\x99 fine clothes\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 waste. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re not like the lasses o\xe2\x80\x99 this countryside. I reckon\r\nfolks is different at Snowfield from what they are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a different sort of life, many of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nwork at different things\xe2\x80\x94some in the mill, and many in the mines, in\r\nthe villages round about. But the heart of man is the same everywhere,\r\nand there are the children of this world and the children of light\r\nthere as well as elsewhere. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve many more Methodists there than\r\nin this country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didna know as the Methody women war like ye, for there\xe2\x80\x99s Will\r\nMaskery\xe2\x80\x99s wife, as they say\xe2\x80\x99s a big Methody, isna pleasant to look at,\r\nat all. I\xe2\x80\x99d as lief look at a tooad. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 I wouldna mind if\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99d stay an\xe2\x80\x99 sleep here, for I should like to see ye i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 mornin\xe2\x80\x99. But mayhappen they\xe2\x80\x99ll be lookin for ye at Mester\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me, and I should like to stay, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s room; I\xe2\x80\x99n got my bed laid i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 little room o\xe2\x80\x99er the\r\nback kitchen, an\xe2\x80\x99 ye can lie beside me. I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to ha\xe2\x80\x99 ye wi\xe2\x80\x99 me to\r\nspeak to i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 night, for ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got a nice way o\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99. It puts me\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 mind o\xe2\x80\x99 the swallows as was under the thack last \xe2\x80\x99ear when they fust\r\nbegun to sing low an\xe2\x80\x99 soft-like i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 mornin\xe2\x80\x99. Eh, but my old man war\r\nfond o\xe2\x80\x99 them birds! An\xe2\x80\x99 so war Adam, but they\xe2\x80\x99n ne\xe2\x80\x99er comed again this\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ear. Happen they\xe2\x80\x99re dead too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cnow the kitchen looks tidy, and now, dear\r\nMother\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99m your daughter to-night, you know\xe2\x80\x94I should like you to\r\nwash your face and have a clean cap on. Do you remember what David did,\r\nwhen God took away his child from him? While the child was yet alive he\r\nfasted and prayed to God to spare it, and he would neither eat nor\r\ndrink, but lay on the ground all night, beseeching God for the child.\r\nBut when he knew it was dead, he rose up from the ground and washed and\r\nanointed himself, and changed his clothes, and ate and drank; and when\r\nthey asked him how it was that he seemed to have left off grieving now\r\nthe child was dead, he said, \xe2\x80\x98While the child was yet alive, I fasted\r\nand wept; for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me,\r\nthat the child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?\r\nCan I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a true word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, my old man wonna come\r\nback to me, but I shall go to him\xe2\x80\x94the sooner the better. Well, ye may\r\ndo as ye like wi\xe2\x80\x99 me: there\xe2\x80\x99s a clean cap i\xe2\x80\x99 that drawer, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the back kitchen an\xe2\x80\x99 wash my face. An\xe2\x80\x99 Seth, thee may\xe2\x80\x99st reach down\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s new Bible wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 picters in, an\xe2\x80\x99 she shall read us a chapter.\r\nEh, I like them words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I shall go to him, but he wonna come back to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the greater\r\nquietness of spirit that had come over Lisbeth. This was what Dinah had\r\nbeen trying to bring about, through all her still sympathy and absence\r\nfrom exhortation. From her girlhood upwards she had had experience\r\namong the sick and the mourning, among minds hardened and shrivelled\r\nthrough poverty and ignorance, and had gained the subtlest perception\r\nof the mode in which they could best be touched and softened into\r\nwillingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning. As\r\nDinah expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was never left to herself; but it was always\r\ngiven her when to keep silence and when to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d And do we not all\r\nagree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of\r\ninspiration? After our subtlest analysis of the mental process, we must\r\nstill say, as Dinah did, that our highest thoughts and our best deeds\r\nare all given to us.\r\n\r\nAnd so there was earnest prayer\xe2\x80\x94there was faith, love, and hope pouring\r\nforth that evening in the little kitchen. And poor, aged, fretful\r\nLisbeth, without grasping any distinct idea, without going through any\r\ncourse of religious emotions, felt a vague sense of goodness and love,\r\nand of something right lying underneath and beyond all this sorrowing\r\nlife. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the sorrow; but, for these moments, under\r\nthe subduing influence of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s spirit, she felt that she must be\r\npatient and still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\nIn the Cottage\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was but half-past four the next morning when Dinah, tired of lying\r\nawake listening to the birds and watching the growing light through the\r\nlittle window in the garret roof, rose and began to dress herself very\r\nquietly, lest she should disturb Lisbeth. But already some one else was\r\nastir in the house, and had gone downstairs, preceded by Gyp. The dog\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npattering step was a sure sign that it was Adam who went down; but\r\nDinah was not aware of this, and she thought it was more likely to be\r\nSeth, for he had told her how Adam had stayed up working the night\r\nbefore. Seth, however, had only just awakened at the sound of the\r\nopening door. The exciting influence of the previous day, heightened at\r\nlast by Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected presence, had not been counteracted by any\r\nbodily weariness, for he had not done his ordinary amount of hard work;\r\nand so when he went to bed; it was not till he had tired himself with\r\nhours of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came, and led on a heavier\r\nmorning sleep than was usual with him.\r\n\r\nBut Adam had been refreshed by his long rest, and with his habitual\r\nimpatience of mere passivity, he was eager to begin the new day and\r\nsubdue sadness by his strong will and strong arm. The white mist lay in\r\nthe valley; it was going to be a bright warm day, and he would start to\r\nwork again when he had had his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but what\xe2\x80\x99s bearable as long as a man can work,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthe natur o\xe2\x80\x99 things doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change, though it seems\r\nas if one\xe2\x80\x99s own life was nothing but change. The square o\xe2\x80\x99 four is\r\nsixteen, and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight,\r\nis as true when a man\xe2\x80\x99s miserable as when he\xe2\x80\x99s happy; and the best o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworking is, it gives you a grip hold o\xe2\x80\x99 things outside your own lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he dashed the cold water over his head and face, he felt completely\r\nhimself again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick\r\nblack hair all glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the\r\nworkshop to look out the wood for his father\xe2\x80\x99s coffin, intending that\r\nhe and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s and have the\r\ncoffin made by one of the workmen there, so that his mother might not\r\nsee and hear the sad task going forward at home.\r\n\r\nHe had just gone into the workshop when his quick ear detected a light\r\nrapid foot on the stairs\xe2\x80\x94certainly not his mother\xe2\x80\x99s. He had been in bed\r\nand asleep when Dinah had come in, in the evening, and now he wondered\r\nwhose step this could be. A foolish thought came, and moved him\r\nstrangely. As if it could be Hetty! She was the last person likely to\r\nbe in the house. And yet he felt reluctant to go and look and have the\r\nclear proof that it was some one else. He stood leaning on a plank he\r\nhad taken hold of, listening to sounds which his imagination\r\ninterpreted for him so pleasantly that the keen strong face became\r\nsuffused with a timid tenderness. The light footstep moved about the\r\nkitchen, followed by the sound of the sweeping brush, hardly making so\r\nmuch noise as the lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along\r\nthe dusty path; and Adam\xe2\x80\x99s imagination saw a dimpled face, with dark\r\nbright eyes and roguish smiles looking backward at this brush, and a\r\nrounded figure just leaning a little to clasp the handle. A very\r\nfoolish thought\xe2\x80\x94it could not be Hetty; but the only way of dismissing\r\nsuch nonsense from his head was to go and see _who_ it was, for his\r\nfancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he stood there\r\nlistening. He loosed the plank and went to the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Adam Bede?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, in her calm treble, pausing\r\nfrom her sweeping and fixing her mild grave eyes upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you\r\nfeel rested and strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the moonlight. Adam\r\nhad seen Dinah several times, but always at the Hall Farm, where he was\r\nnot very vividly conscious of any woman\xe2\x80\x99s presence except Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nhe had only in the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in\r\nlove with her, so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn\r\ntowards her for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s sake. But now her slim figure, her plain\r\nblack gown, and her pale serene face impressed him with all the force\r\nthat belongs to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy. For the\r\nfirst moment or two he made no answer, but looked at her with the\r\nconcentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object in which\r\nhe has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, for the first time in\r\nher life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was something in the\r\ndark penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the\r\nmildness and timidity of his brother Seth. A faint blush came, which\r\ndeepened as she wondered at it. This blush recalled Adam from his\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was quite taken by surprise; it was very good of you to come and see\r\nmy mother in her trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a gentle grateful tone, for his\r\nquick mind told him at once how she came to be there. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope my mother\r\nwas thankful to have you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, wondering rather anxiously what\r\nhad been Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s reception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, resuming her work, \xe2\x80\x9cshe seemed greatly comforted\r\nafter a while, and she\xe2\x80\x99s had a good deal of rest in the night, by\r\ntimes. She was fast asleep when I left her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it took the news to the Hall Farm?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, his thoughts\r\nreverting to some one there; he wondered whether _she_ had felt\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Mr. Irwine, the clergyman, told me, and my aunt was grieved for\r\nyour mother when she heard it, and wanted me to come; and so is my\r\nuncle, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, now he\xe2\x80\x99s heard it, but he was gone out to Rosseter all\r\nyesterday. They\xe2\x80\x99ll look for you there as soon as you\xe2\x80\x99ve got time to go,\r\nfor there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody round that hearth but what\xe2\x80\x99s glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah, with her sympathetic divination, knew quite well that Adam was\r\nlonging to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble; she was\r\ntoo rigorously truthful for benevolent invention, but she had contrived\r\nto say something in which Hetty was tacitly included. Love has a way of\r\ncheating itself consciously, like a child who plays at solitary\r\nhide-and-seek; it is pleased with assurances that it all the while\r\ndisbelieves. Adam liked what Dinah had said so much that his mind was\r\ndirectly full of the next visit he should pay to the Hall Farm, when\r\nHetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had ever done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t be there yourself any longer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I go back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I shall have to set out to\r\nTreddleston early, to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier. So I must\r\ngo back to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day with my aunt\r\nand her children. But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would\r\nlike me; and her heart seemed inclined towards me last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, she\xe2\x80\x99s sure to want you to-day. If mother takes to people at\r\nthe beginning, she\xe2\x80\x99s sure to get fond of \xe2\x80\x99em; but she\xe2\x80\x99s a strange way\r\nof not liking young women. Though, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam went on, smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cher not liking other young women is no reason why she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless\r\nsilence, seated on his haunches, and alternately looking up in his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s face to watch its expression and observing Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s movements\r\nabout the kitchen. The kind smile with which Adam uttered the last\r\nwords was apparently decisive with Gyp of the light in which the\r\nstranger was to be regarded, and as she turned round after putting\r\naside her sweeping-brush, he trotted towards her and put up his muzzle\r\nagainst her hand in a friendly way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see Gyp bids you welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s very slow to\r\nwelcome strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, patting the rough grey coat, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a strange\r\nfeeling about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak, and it was a\r\ntrouble to \xe2\x80\x99em because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being sorry for the\r\ndogs always, though perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s no need. But they may well have\r\nmore in them than they know how to make us understand, for we can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nhalf what we feel, with all our words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah; he\r\nwanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women. But\r\nafter a few words of greeting, Adam drew him into the workshop to\r\nconsult about the coffin, and Dinah went on with her cleaning.\r\n\r\nBy six o\xe2\x80\x99clock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as\r\nclean as she could have made it herself. The window and door were open,\r\nand the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood,\r\nthyme, and sweet-briar from the patch of garden by the side of the\r\ncottage. Dinah did not sit down at first, but moved about, serving the\r\nothers with the warm porridge and the toasted oat-cake, which she had\r\ngot ready in the usual way, for she had asked Seth to tell her just\r\nwhat his mother gave them for breakfast. Lisbeth had been unusually\r\nsilent since she came downstairs, apparently requiring some time to\r\nadjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a\r\nlady to find all the work done, and sat still to be waited on. Her new\r\nsensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief. At last,\r\nafter tasting the porridge, she broke silence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe might ha\xe2\x80\x99 made the parridge worse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cI can ate\r\nit wi\xe2\x80\x99out its turnin\xe2\x80\x99 my stomach. It might ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a trifle thicker\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 no harm, an\xe2\x80\x99 I allays putten a sprig o\xe2\x80\x99 mint in mysen; but how\xe2\x80\x99s ye\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 know that? The lads arena like to get folks as \xe2\x80\x99ll make their\r\nparridge as I\xe2\x80\x99n made it for \xe2\x80\x99em; it\xe2\x80\x99s well if they get onybody as \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake parridge at all. But ye might do, wi\xe2\x80\x99 a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 showin\xe2\x80\x99; for ye\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na stirrin\xe2\x80\x99 body in a mornin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 ye\xe2\x80\x99ve a light heel, an\xe2\x80\x99 ye\xe2\x80\x99ve cleaned\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 house well enough for a ma\xe2\x80\x99shift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakeshift, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think the house looks\r\nbeautiful. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it could look better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee dostna know? Nay; how\xe2\x80\x99s thee to know? Th\xe2\x80\x99 men ne\xe2\x80\x99er know whether\r\nthe floor\xe2\x80\x99s cleaned or cat-licked. But thee\xe2\x80\x99lt know when thee gets thy\r\nparridge burnt, as it\xe2\x80\x99s like enough to be when I\xe2\x80\x99n gi\xe2\x80\x99en o\xe2\x80\x99er makin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit. Thee\xe2\x80\x99lt think thy mother war good for summat then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cdo come and sit down now and have your breakfast.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re all served now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, come an\xe2\x80\x99 sit ye down\xe2\x80\x94do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 ate a morsel; ye\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nneed, arter bein\xe2\x80\x99 upo\xe2\x80\x99 your legs this hour an\xe2\x80\x99 half a\xe2\x80\x99ready. Come,\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a tone of complaining affection, as Dinah sat down\r\nby her side, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be loath for ye t\xe2\x80\x99 go, but ye canna stay much\r\nlonger, I doubt. I could put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house better nor wi\xe2\x80\x99 most\r\nfolks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay till to-night if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d stay\r\nlonger, only I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I must be\r\nwith my aunt to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, I\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er go back to that country. My old man come from that\r\nStonyshire side, but he left it when he war a young un, an\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nright on\xe2\x80\x99t too; for he said as there war no wood there, an\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen a bad country for a carpenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember father telling me when I was a little lad\r\nthat he made up his mind if ever he moved it should be south\xe2\x80\x99ard. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure about it. Bartle Massey says\xe2\x80\x94and he knows the South\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nthe northern men are a finer breed than the southern, harder-headed and\r\nstronger-bodied, and a deal taller. And then he says in some o\xe2\x80\x99 those\r\ncounties it\xe2\x80\x99s as flat as the back o\xe2\x80\x99 your hand, and you can see nothing\r\nof a distance without climbing up the highest trees. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide\r\nthat. I like to go to work by a road that\xe2\x80\x99ll take me up a bit of a\r\nhill, and see the fields for miles round me, and a bridge, or a town,\r\nor a bit of a steeple here and there. It makes you feel the world\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbig place, and there\xe2\x80\x99s other men working in it with their heads and\r\nhands besides yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like th\xe2\x80\x99 hills best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the clouds are over your head\r\nand you see the sun shining ever so far off, over the Loamford way, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve often done o\xe2\x80\x99 late, on the stormy days. It seems to me as if that\r\nwas heaven where there\xe2\x80\x99s always joy and sunshine, though this life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndark and cloudy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I love the Stonyshire side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to set\r\nmy face towards the countries where they\xe2\x80\x99re rich in corn and cattle,\r\nand the ground so level and easy to tread; and to turn my back on the\r\nhills where the poor people have to live such a hard life and the men\r\nspend their days in the mines away from the sunlight. It\xe2\x80\x99s very blessed\r\non a bleak cold day, when the sky is hanging dark over the hill, to\r\nfeel the love of God in one\xe2\x80\x99s soul, and carry it to the lonely, bare,\r\nstone houses, where there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else to give comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s very well for ye to talk, as looks welly\r\nlike the snowdrop-flowers as ha\xe2\x80\x99 lived for days an\xe2\x80\x99 days when I\xe2\x80\x99n\r\ngethered \xe2\x80\x99em, wi\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 water an\xe2\x80\x99 a peep o\xe2\x80\x99 daylight;\r\nbut th\xe2\x80\x99 hungry foulks had better leave th\xe2\x80\x99 hungry country. It makes\r\nless mouths for the scant cake. But,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, looking at Adam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdonna thee talk o\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 south\xe2\x80\x99ard or north\xe2\x80\x99ard, an\xe2\x80\x99 leavin\xe2\x80\x99 thy\r\nfeyther and mother i\xe2\x80\x99 the churchyard, an\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 to a country as they\r\nknow nothin\xe2\x80\x99 on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er rest i\xe2\x80\x99 my grave if I donna see thee i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nchurchyard of a Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonna fear, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadna made up my mind not to go,\r\nI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been gone before now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had finished his breakfast now, and rose as he was speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lisbeth. \xe2\x80\x9cSet about thy feyther\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoffin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re going to take the wood to the village\r\nand have it made there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lad, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth burst out in an eager, wailing tone; \xe2\x80\x9cthee\r\nwotna let nobody make thy feyther\xe2\x80\x99s coffin but thysen? Who\xe2\x80\x99d make it so\r\nwell? An\xe2\x80\x99 him as know\xe2\x80\x99d what good work war, an\xe2\x80\x99s got a son as is the\r\nhead o\xe2\x80\x99 the village an\xe2\x80\x99 all Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on too, for cleverness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, mother, if that\xe2\x80\x99s thy wish, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the coffin at home;\r\nbut I thought thee wouldstna like to hear the work going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 why shouldna I like \xe2\x80\x99t? It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to be done. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s liking got to do wi\xe2\x80\x99t? It\xe2\x80\x99s choice o\xe2\x80\x99 mislikings is all I\xe2\x80\x99n got\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 this world. One morsel\xe2\x80\x99s as good as another when your mouth\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntaste. Thee mun set about it now this mornin\xe2\x80\x99 fust thing. I wonna ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnobody to touch the coffin but thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met Seth\xe2\x80\x99s, which looked from Dinah to him rather\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not consent but Seth shall have a hand in\r\nit too, if it\xe2\x80\x99s to be done at home. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the village this\r\nforenoon, because Mr. Burge \xe2\x80\x99ull want to see me, and Seth shall stay at\r\nhome and begin the coffin. I can come back at noon, and then he can\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99n set my heart on\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nas thee shalt ma\xe2\x80\x99 thy feyther\xe2\x80\x99s coffin. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t so stiff an\xe2\x80\x99 masterful,\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99t ne\xe2\x80\x99er do as thy mother wants thee. Thee wast often angered wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthy feyther when he war alive; thee must be the better to him now he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone. He\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought nothin\xe2\x80\x99 on\xe2\x80\x99t for Seth to ma\xe2\x80\x99s coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, Adam, say no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, gently, though his voice\r\ntold that he spoke with some effort; \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s in the right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to\r\nwork, and do thee stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed into the workshop immediately, followed by Adam; while\r\nLisbeth, automatically obeying her old habits, began to put away the\r\nbreakfast things, as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any\r\nlonger. Dinah said nothing, but presently used the opportunity of\r\nquietly joining the brothers in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThey had already got on their aprons and paper caps, and Adam was\r\nstanding with his left hand on Seth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, while he pointed with\r\nthe hammer in his right to some boards which they were looking at.\r\nTheir backs were turned towards the door by which Dinah entered, and\r\nshe came in so gently that they were not aware of her presence till\r\nthey heard her voice saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSeth Bede!\xe2\x80\x9d Seth started, and they both\r\nturned round. Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam, and fixed her\r\neyes on Seth\xe2\x80\x99s face, saying with calm kindness, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say farewell.\r\nI shall see you again when you come from work. So as I\xe2\x80\x99m at the farm\r\nbefore dark, it will be quite soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Dinah; I should like to walk home with you once more. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nperhaps be the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little tremor in Seth\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Dinah put out her hand and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have sweet peace in your mind to-day, Seth, for your\r\ntenderness and long-suffering towards your aged mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she\r\nhad entered it. Adam had been observing her closely all the while, but\r\nshe had not looked at him. As soon as she was gone, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder at thee for loving her, Seth. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a face like a lily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s soul rushed to his eyes and lips: he had never yet confessed his\r\nsecret to Adam, but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment, as\r\nhe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cAye, Addy, I do love her\xe2\x80\x94too much, I doubt. But she\r\ndoesna love me, lad, only as one child o\xe2\x80\x99 God loves another. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever love any man as a husband\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my belief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lad, there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling; thee mustna lose heart. She\xe2\x80\x99s made out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 stuff with a finer grain than most o\xe2\x80\x99 the women; I can see that\r\nclear enough. But if she\xe2\x80\x99s better than they are in other things, I\r\ncanna think she\xe2\x80\x99ll fall short of \xe2\x80\x99em in loving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo more was said. Seth set out to the village, and Adam began his work\r\non the coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help the lad, and me too,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he lifted the board.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like enough to find life a tough job\xe2\x80\x94hard work inside and out.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a strange thing to think of a man as can lift a chair with his\r\nteeth and walk fifty mile on end, trembling and turning hot and cold at\r\nonly a look from one woman out of all the rest i\xe2\x80\x99 the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmystery we can give no account of; but no more we can of the sprouting\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the seed, for that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\nIn the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same Thursday morning, as Arthur Donnithorne was moving about in\r\nhis dressing-room seeing his well-looking British person reflected in\r\nthe old-fashioned mirrors, and stared at, from a dingy olive-green\r\npiece of tapestry, by Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and her maidens, who ought to\r\nhave been minding the infant Moses, he was holding a discussion with\r\nhimself, which, by the time his valet was tying the black silk sling\r\nover his shoulder, had issued in a distinct practical resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so be ready\r\nby half-past eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe low whistle, which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution,\r\nhere broke out into his loudest ringing tenor, and the corridor, as he\r\nhurried along it, echoed to his favourite song from the Beggar\xe2\x80\x99s Opera,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the heart of a man is oppressed with care.\xe2\x80\x9d Not an heroic strain;\r\nnevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the\r\nstables to give his orders about the horses. His own approbation was\r\nnecessary to him, and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite\r\ngratuitously; it must be won by a fair amount of merit. He had never\r\nyet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable reliance on his\r\nown virtues. No young man could confess his faults more candidly;\r\ncandour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a man\xe2\x80\x99s candour\r\nbe seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of? But\r\nhe had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94impetuous, warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty,\r\nreptilian. It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything\r\nmean, dastardly, or cruel. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! I\xe2\x80\x99m a devil of a fellow for getting\r\nmyself into a hobble, but I always take care the load shall fall on my\r\nown shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d Unhappily, there is no inherent poetical justice in\r\nhobbles, and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their\r\nworst consequences on the prime offender, in spite of his loudly\r\nexpressed wish. It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme\r\nof things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides\r\nhimself. He was nothing if not good-natured; and all his pictures of\r\nthe future, when he should come into the estate, were made up of a\r\nprosperous, contented tenantry, adoring their landlord, who would be\r\nthe model of an English gentleman\xe2\x80\x94mansion in first-rate order, all\r\nelegance and high taste\xe2\x80\x94jolly housekeeping, finest stud in\r\nLoamshire\xe2\x80\x94purse open to all public objects\xe2\x80\x94in short, everything as\r\ndifferent as possible from what was now associated with the name of\r\nDonnithorne. And one of the first good actions he would perform in that\r\nfuture should be to increase Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s income for the vicarage of\r\nHayslope, so that he might keep a carriage for his mother and sisters.\r\nHis hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and\r\ntrousers. It was an affection partly filial, partly fraternal\xe2\x80\x94fraternal\r\nenough to make him like Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s company better than that of most\r\nyounger men, and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from\r\nincurring Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s disapprobation.\r\n\r\nYou perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was \xe2\x80\x9ca good fellow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all his\r\ncollege friends thought him such. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see any one\r\nuncomfortable; he would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for\r\nany harm to happen to his grandfather; and his Aunt Lydia herself had\r\nthe benefit of that soft-heartedness which he bore towards the whole\r\nsex. Whether he would have self-mastery enough to be always as harmless\r\nand purely beneficent as his good-nature led him to desire, was a\r\nquestion that no one had yet decided against him; he was but\r\ntwenty-one, you remember, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t inquire too closely into\r\ncharacter in the case of a handsome generous young fellow, who will\r\nhave property enough to support numerous peccadilloes\xe2\x80\x94who, if he should\r\nunfortunately break a man\xe2\x80\x99s legs in his rash driving, will be able to\r\npension him handsomely; or if he should happen to spoil a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexistence for her, will make it up to her with expensive _bon-bons_,\r\npacked up and directed by his own hand. It would be ridiculous to be\r\nprying and analytic in such cases, as if one were inquiring into the\r\ncharacter of a confidential clerk. We use round, general, gentlemanly\r\nepithets about a young man of birth and fortune; and ladies, with that\r\nfine intuition which is the distinguishing attribute of their sex, see\r\nat once that he is \xe2\x80\x9cnice.\xe2\x80\x9d The chances are that he will go through life\r\nwithout scandalizing any one; a seaworthy vessel that no one would\r\nrefuse to insure. Ships, certainly, are liable to casualties, which\r\nsometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that\r\nwould never have been discoverable in smooth water; and many a \xe2\x80\x9cgood\r\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x9d through a disastrous combination of circumstances, has\r\nundergone a like betrayal.\r\n\r\nBut we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries\r\nconcerning Arthur Donnithorne, who this morning proves himself capable\r\nof a prudent resolution founded on conscience. One thing is clear:\r\nNature has taken care that he shall never go far astray with perfect\r\ncomfort and satisfaction to himself; he will never get beyond that\r\nborder-land of sin, where he will be perpetually harassed by assaults\r\nfrom the other side of the boundary. He will never be a courtier of\r\nVice, and wear her orders in his button-hole.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly;\r\neverything was looking lovelier for the yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s rain. It is a\r\npleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the well-rolled gravel\r\non one\xe2\x80\x99s way to the stables, meditating an excursion. But the scent of\r\nthe stables, which, in a natural state of things, ought to be among the\r\nsoothing influences of a man\xe2\x80\x99s life, always brought with it some\r\nirritation to Arthur. There was no having his own way in the stables;\r\neverything was managed in the stingiest fashion. His grandfather\r\npersisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of lever\r\ncould move out of his old habits, and who was allowed to hire a\r\nsuccession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates, one of whom had\r\nlately tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s bay mare. This state of things is naturally embittering; one\r\ncan put up with annoyances in the house, but to have the stable made a\r\nscene of vexation and disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and\r\nblood can be expected to endure long together without danger of\r\nmisanthropy.\r\n\r\nOld John\xe2\x80\x99s wooden, deep-wrinkled face was the first object that met\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as he entered the stable-yard, and it quite poisoned for\r\nhim the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch there. He could\r\nnever speak quite patiently to the old blockhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at half-past\r\neleven, and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the same time. Do\r\nyou hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hear, I hear, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x9d said old John very deliberately,\r\nfollowing the young master into the stable. John considered a young\r\nmaster as the natural enemy of an old servant, and young people in\r\ngeneral as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world.\r\n\r\nArthur went in for the sake of patting Meg, declining as far as\r\npossible to see anything in the stables, lest he should lose his temper\r\nbefore breakfast. The pretty creature was in one of the inner stables,\r\nand turned her mild head as her master came beside her. Little Trot, a\r\ntiny spaniel, her inseparable companion in the stable, was comfortably\r\ncurled up on her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Meg, my pretty girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, patting her neck, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\na glorious canter this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, your honour, I donna see as that can be,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot be? Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s got lamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLamed, confound you! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, th\xe2\x80\x99 lad took her too close to Dalton\xe2\x80\x99s hosses, an\xe2\x80\x99 one on \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nflung out at her, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s got her shank bruised o\xe2\x80\x99 the near foreleg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued.\r\nYou understand that there was a great deal of strong language, mingled\r\nwith soothing \xe2\x80\x9cwho-ho\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d while the leg was examined; that John stood by\r\nwith quite as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved\r\ncrab-tree walking-stick, and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed\r\nthe iron gates of the pleasure-ground without singing as he went.\r\n\r\nHe considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed. There was\r\nnot another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg\r\nand Rattler. It was vexatious; just when he wanted to get out of the\r\nway for a week or two. It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a\r\ncombination of circumstances. To be shut up at the Chase with a broken\r\narm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at\r\nWindsor\xe2\x80\x94shut up with his grandfather, who had the same sort of\r\naffection for him as for his parchment deeds! And to be disgusted at\r\nevery turn with the management of the house and the estate! In such\r\ncircumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour, and works off\r\nthe irritation by some excess or other. \xe2\x80\x9cSalkeld would have drunk a\r\nbottle of port every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not well\r\nseasoned enough for that. Well, since I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Eagledale, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave a gallop on Rattler to Norburne this morning, and lunch with\r\nGawaine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one. If he\r\nlunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting, he should not reach the\r\nChase again till nearly five, when Hetty would be safe out of his sight\r\nin the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room; and when she set out to go home, it would be\r\nhis lazy time after dinner, so he should keep out of her way\r\naltogether. There really would have been no harm in being kind to the\r\nlittle thing, and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom belles\r\nonly to look at Hetty for half an hour. But perhaps he had better not\r\ntake any more notice of her; it might put notions into her head, as\r\nIrwine had hinted; though Arthur, for his part, thought girls were not\r\nby any means so soft and easily bruised; indeed, he had generally found\r\nthem twice as cool and cunning as he was himself. As for any real harm\r\nin Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s case, it was out of the question: Arthur Donnithorne\r\naccepted his own bond for himself with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\nSo the twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne; and by\r\ngood fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine\r\nleaps for Rattler. Nothing like \xe2\x80\x9ctaking\xe2\x80\x9d a few bushes and ditches for\r\nexorcising a demon; and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs,\r\nwith their immense advantages in this way, have left so bad a\r\nreputation in history.\r\n\r\nAfter this, you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine\r\nwas at home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared\r\nthe last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the\r\nentrance-gates, got down from the panting Rattler, and went into the\r\nhouse to take a hasty luncheon. But I believe there have been men since\r\nhis day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre, and then\r\ngalloped hastily back lest they should miss it. It is the favourite\r\nstratagem of our passions to sham a retreat, and to turn sharp round\r\nupon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s been ridin\xe2\x80\x99 the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own pace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dalton the\r\ncoachman, whose person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe\r\nagainst the stable wall, when John brought up Rattler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d get the devil to do\xe2\x80\x99s grooming for\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x9d growled John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye; he\xe2\x80\x99d hev a deal haimabler groom nor what he has now,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nDalton\xe2\x80\x94and the joke appeared to him so good that, being left alone upon\r\nthe scene, he continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in\r\norder to wink at an imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a\r\nsilent, ventral laughter, mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the\r\nbeginning, that he might recite it with effect in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur went up to his dressing-room again after luncheon, it was\r\ninevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the\r\nday should flash across his mind; but it was impossible for him now to\r\ndwell on the remembrance\xe2\x80\x94impossible to recall the feelings and\r\nreflections which had been decisive with him then, any more than to\r\nrecall the peculiar scent of the air that had freshened him when he\r\nfirst opened his window. The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like\r\nan ill-stemmed current; he was amazed himself at the force with which\r\nthis trivial fancy seemed to grasp him: he was even rather tremulous as\r\nhe brushed his hair\xe2\x80\x94pooh! it was riding in that break-neck way. It was\r\nbecause he had made a serious affair of an idle matter, by thinking of\r\nit as if it were of any consequence. He would amuse himself by seeing\r\nHetty to-day, and get rid of the whole thing from his mind. It was all\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x99s fault. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Irwine had said nothing, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought\r\nhalf so much of Hetty as of Meg\xe2\x80\x99s lameness.\xe2\x80\x9d However, it was just the\r\nsort of day for lolling in the Hermitage, and he would go and finish\r\nDr. Moore\xe2\x80\x99s _Zeluco_ there before dinner. The Hermitage stood in\r\nFir-tree Grove\xe2\x80\x94the way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall\r\nFarm. So nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty was a\r\nmere circumstance of his walk, not its object.\r\n\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the\r\nChase than might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a\r\nwarm afternoon, and it was still scarcely four o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he stood\r\nbefore the tall narrow gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine\r\nwood which skirted one side of the Chase, and which was called Fir-tree\r\nGrove, not because the firs were many, but because they were few. It\r\nwas a wood of beeches and limes, with here and there a light\r\nsilver-stemmed birch\xe2\x80\x94just the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs:\r\nyou see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs, or\r\npeeping from behind the smooth-sweeping outline of a tall lime; you\r\nhear their soft liquid laughter\xe2\x80\x94but if you look with a too curious\r\nsacrilegious eye, they vanish behind the silvery beeches, they make you\r\nbelieve that their voice was only a running brooklet, perhaps they\r\nmetamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers away and\r\nmocks you from the topmost bough. It was not a grove with measured\r\ngrass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but with narrow,\r\nhollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes of delicate\r\nmoss\xe2\x80\x94paths which look as if they were made by the free will of the\r\ntrees and underwood, moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen\r\nof the white-footed nymphs.\r\n\r\nIt was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne\r\npassed, under an avenue of limes and beeches. It was a still\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x94the golden light was lingering languidly among the upper\r\nboughs, only glancing down here and there on the purple pathway and its\r\nedge of faintly sprinkled moss: an afternoon in which destiny disguises\r\nher cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil, encloses us in warm\r\ndowny wings, and poisons us with violet-scented breath. Arthur strolled\r\nalong carelessly, with a book under his arm, but not looking on the\r\nground as meditative men are apt to do; his eyes _would_ fix themselves\r\non the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely\r\nappear before long. Ah! There she comes. First a bright patch of\r\ncolour, like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure,\r\nwith a round hat on, and a small basket under her arm; then a\r\ndeep-blushing, almost frightened, but bright-smiling girl, making her\r\ncurtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance, as Arthur came up to her. If\r\nArthur had had time to think at all, he would have thought it strange\r\nthat he should feel fluttered too, be conscious of blushing too\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise\r\ninstead of meeting just what he expected. Poor things! It was a pity\r\nthey were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have\r\nstood face to face, eyeing each other with timid liking, then given\r\neach other a little butterfly kiss, and toddled off to play together.\r\nArthur would have gone home to his silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her\r\nhome-spun pillow, and both would have slept without dreams, and\r\nto-morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday.\r\n\r\nArthur turned round and walked by Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s side without giving a reason.\r\nThey were alone together for the first time. What an overpowering\r\npresence that first privacy is! He actually dared not look at this\r\nlittle butter-maker for the first minute or two. As for Hetty, her feet\r\nrested on a cloud, and she was borne along by warm zephyrs; she had\r\nforgotten her rose-coloured ribbons; she was no more conscious of her\r\nlimbs than if her childish soul had passed into a water-lily, resting\r\non a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sun-beams. It may seem a\r\ncontradiction, but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and\r\nconfidence from his timidity: it was an entirely different state of\r\nmind from what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty; and full\r\nas he was of vague feeling, there was room, in those moments of\r\nsilence, for the thought that his previous debates and scruples were\r\nneedless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last, looking down at Hetty; \xe2\x80\x9cit is so much prettier as well as\r\nshorter than coming by either of the lodges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty answered, with a tremulous, almost whispering voice.\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr. Arthur,\r\nand her very vanity made her more coy of speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you come every week to see Mrs. Pomfret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, every Thursday, only when she\xe2\x80\x99s got to go out with Miss\r\nDonnithorne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s teaching you something, is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, the lace-mending as she learnt abroad, and the\r\nstocking-mending\xe2\x80\x94it looks just like the stocking, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen mended; and she teaches me cutting-out too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! are _you_ going to be a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be one very much indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty spoke more audibly\r\nnow, but still rather tremulously; she thought, perhaps she seemed as\r\nstupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Mrs. Pomfret always expects you at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe expects me at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I\xe2\x80\x99m rather late to-day, because my\r\naunt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare me; but the regular time is four, because that\r\ngives us time before Miss Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s bell rings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, I must not keep you now, else I should like to show you the\r\nHermitage. Did you ever see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the walk where we turn up to it. But we must not go now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow it you some other time, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you always come back this way in the evening, or are you afraid to\r\ncome so lonely a road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s never late; I always set out by eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so light now in the evening. My aunt would be angry with me if I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t get home before nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Craig, the gardener, comes to take care of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep blush overspread Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face and neck. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure he never did; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nhastily, and the tears of vexation had come so fast that before she had\r\ndone speaking a bright drop rolled down her hot cheek. Then she felt\r\nashamed to death that she was crying, and for one long instant her\r\nhappiness was all gone. But in the next she felt an arm steal round\r\nher, and a gentle voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Hetty, what makes you cry? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to vex you. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vex you for the world, you little blossom.\r\nCome, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry; look at me, else I shall think you won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him, and\r\nwas stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty. Hetty\r\nlifted her long dewy lashes, and met the eyes that were bent towards\r\nher with a sweet, timid, beseeching look. What a space of time those\r\nthree moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her! Love\r\nis such a simple thing when we have only one-and-twenty summers and a\r\nsweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance, as if she were a bud\r\nfirst opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning. Such\r\nyoung unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches\r\nthat touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two\r\nbrooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple\r\nwith ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places. While\r\nArthur gazed into Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s dark beseeching eyes, it made no difference\r\nto him what sort of English she spoke; and even if hoops and powder had\r\nbeen in fashion, he would very likely not have been sensible just then\r\nthat Hetty wanted those signs of high breeding.\r\n\r\nBut they started asunder with beating hearts: something had fallen on\r\nthe ground with a rattling noise; it was Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s basket; all her little\r\nworkwoman\xe2\x80\x99s matters were scattered on the path, some of them showing a\r\ncapability of rolling to great lengths. There was much to be done in\r\npicking up, and not a word was spoken; but when Arthur hung the basket\r\nover her arm again, the poor child felt a strange difference in his\r\nlook and manner. He just pressed her hand, and said, with a look and\r\ntone that were almost chilling to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been hindering you; I\r\nmust not keep you any longer now. You will be expected at the house.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for her to speak, he turned away from her and hurried\r\nback towards the road that led to the Hermitage, leaving Hetty to\r\npursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in\r\nbewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness.\r\nWould he meet her again as she came home? Why had he spoken almost as\r\nif he were displeased with her? And then run away so suddenly? She\r\ncried, hardly knowing why.\r\n\r\nArthur too was very uneasy, but his feelings were lit up for him by a\r\nmore distinct consciousness. He hurried to the Hermitage, which stood\r\nin the heart of the wood, unlocked the door with a hasty wrench,\r\nslammed it after him, pitched _Zeluco_ into the most distant corner,\r\nand thrusting his right hand into his pocket, first walked four or five\r\ntimes up and down the scanty length of the little room, and then seated\r\nhimself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do\r\nwhen we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling.\r\n\r\nHe was getting in love with Hetty\xe2\x80\x94that was quite plain. He was ready to\r\npitch everything else\xe2\x80\x94no matter where\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of surrendering\r\nhimself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself. It\r\nwas no use blinking the fact now\xe2\x80\x94they would get too fond of each other,\r\nif he went on taking notice of her\xe2\x80\x94and what would come of it? He should\r\nhave to go away in a few weeks, and the poor little thing would be\r\nmiserable. He _must not_ see her alone again; he must keep out of her\r\nway. What a fool he was for coming back from Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\n\r\nHe got up and threw open the windows, to let in the soft breath of the\r\nafternoon, and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the\r\nHermitage. The soft air did not help his resolution, as he leaned out\r\nand looked into the leafy distance. But he considered his resolution\r\nsufficiently fixed: there was no need to debate with himself any\r\nlonger. He had made up his mind not to meet Hetty again; and now he\r\nmight give himself up to thinking how immensely agreeable it would be\r\nif circumstances were different\xe2\x80\x94how pleasant it would have been to meet\r\nher this evening as she came back, and put his arm round her again and\r\nlook into her sweet face. He wondered if the dear little thing were\r\nthinking of him too\xe2\x80\x94twenty to one she was. How beautiful her eyes were\r\nwith the tear on their lashes! He would like to satisfy his soul for a\r\nday with looking at them, and he _must_ see her again\xe2\x80\x94he must see her,\r\nsimply to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to\r\nher just now. He would behave in a quiet, kind way to her\xe2\x80\x94just to\r\nprevent her from going home with her head full of wrong fancies. Yes,\r\nthat would be the best thing to do after all.\r\n\r\nIt was a long while\xe2\x80\x94more than an hour before Arthur had brought his\r\nmeditations to this point; but once arrived there, he could stay no\r\nlonger at the Hermitage. The time must be filled up with movement until\r\nhe should see Hetty again. And it was already late enough to go and\r\ndress for dinner, for his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s dinner-hour was six.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\nEvening in the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that Mrs. Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with Mrs. Best,\r\nthe housekeeper, on this Thursday morning\xe2\x80\x94a fact which had two\r\nconsequences highly convenient to Hetty. It caused Mrs. Pomfret to have\r\ntea sent up to her own room, and it inspired that exemplary lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid\r\nwith so lively a recollection of former passages in Mrs. Best\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct, and of dialogues in which Mrs. Best had decidedly the\r\ninferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs. Pomfret, that Hetty required\r\nno more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle, and\r\nthrowing in an occasional \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d She would have wanted to put\r\non her hat earlier than usual; only she had told Captain Donnithorne\r\nthat she usually set out about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and if he _should_ go to\r\nthe Grove again expecting to see her, and she should be gone! Would he\r\ncome? Her little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory\r\nand dubious expectation. At last the minute-hand of the old-fashioned\r\nbrazen-faced timepiece was on the last quarter to eight, and there was\r\nevery reason for its being time to get ready for departure. Even Mrs.\r\nPomfret\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupied mind did not prevent her from noticing what\r\nlooked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she tied on\r\nher hat before the looking-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat child gets prettier and prettier every day, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nher inward comment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity. She\xe2\x80\x99ll get neither a place\r\nnor a husband any the sooner for it. Sober well-to-do men don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nsuch pretty wives. When I was a girl, I was more admired than if I had\r\nbeen so very pretty. However, she\xe2\x80\x99s reason to be grateful to me for\r\nteaching her something to get her bread with, better than farm-house\r\nwork. They always told me I was good-natured\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth, and\r\nto my hurt too, else there\xe2\x80\x99s them in this house that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here\r\nnow to lord it over me in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasure-ground which\r\nshe had to traverse, dreading to meet Mr. Craig, to whom she could\r\nhardly have spoken civilly. How relieved she was when she had got\r\nsafely under the oaks and among the fern of the Chase! Even then she\r\nwas as ready to be startled as the deer that leaped away at her\r\napproach. She thought nothing of the evening light that lay gently in\r\nthe grassy alleys between the fern, and made the beauty of their living\r\ngreen more visible than it had been in the overpowering flood of noon:\r\nshe thought of nothing that was present. She only saw something that\r\nwas possible: Mr. Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the\r\nFir-tree Grove. That was the foreground of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s picture; behind it\r\nlay a bright hazy something\xe2\x80\x94days that were not to be as the other days\r\nof her life had been. It was as if she had been wooed by a river-god,\r\nwho might any time take her to his wondrous halls below a watery\r\nheaven. There was no knowing what would come, since this strange\r\nentrancing delight had come. If a chest full of lace and satin and\r\njewels had been sent her from some unknown source, how could she but\r\nhave thought that her whole lot was going to change, and that to-morrow\r\nsome still more bewildering joy would befall her? Hetty had never read\r\na novel; if she had ever seen one, I think the words would have been\r\ntoo hard for her; how then could she find a shape for her expectations?\r\nThey were as formless as the sweet languid odours of the garden at the\r\nChase, which had floated past her as she walked by the gate.\r\n\r\nShe is at another gate now\xe2\x80\x94that leading into Fir-tree Grove. She enters\r\nthe wood, where it is already twilight, and at every step she takes,\r\nthe fear at her heart becomes colder. If he should not come! Oh, how\r\ndreary it was\xe2\x80\x94the thought of going out at the other end of the wood,\r\ninto the unsheltered road, without having seen him. She reaches the\r\nfirst turning towards the Hermitage, walking slowly\xe2\x80\x94he is not there.\r\nShe hates the leveret that runs across the path; she hates everything\r\nthat is not what she longs for. She walks on, happy whenever she is\r\ncoming to a bend in the road, for perhaps he is behind it. No. She is\r\nbeginning to cry: her heart has swelled so, the tears stand in her\r\neyes; she gives one great sob, while the corners of her mouth quiver,\r\nand the tears roll down.\r\n\r\nShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that there is another turning to the Hermitage, that\r\nshe is close against it, and that Arthur Donnithorne is only a few\r\nyards from her, full of one thought, and a thought of which she only is\r\nthe object. He is going to see Hetty again: that is the longing which\r\nhas been growing through the last three hours to a feverish thirst.\r\nNot, of course, to speak in the caressing way into which he had\r\nunguardedly fallen before dinner, but to set things right with her by a\r\nkindness which would have the air of friendly civility, and prevent her\r\nfrom running away with wrong notions about their mutual relation.\r\n\r\nIf Hetty had known he was there, she would not have cried; and it would\r\nhave been better, for then Arthur would perhaps have behaved as wisely\r\nas he had intended. As it was, she started when he appeared at the end\r\nof the side-alley, and looked up at him with two great drops rolling\r\ndown her cheeks. What else could he do but speak to her in a soft,\r\nsoothing tone, as if she were a bright-eyed spaniel with a thorn in her\r\nfoot?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas something frightened you, Hetty? Have you seen anything in the\r\nwood? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was blushing so, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she was happy or\r\nmiserable. To be crying again\xe2\x80\x94what did gentlemen think of girls who\r\ncried in that way? She felt unable even to say \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d but could only\r\nlook away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek. Not before a\r\ngreat drop had fallen on her rose-coloured strings\xe2\x80\x94she knew that quite\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, be cheerful again. Smile at me, and tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter.\r\nCome, tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty turned her head towards him, whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x9d and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him. That look was\r\ntoo much: he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too\r\nlovingly in return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou little frightened bird! Little tearful rose! Silly pet! You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncry again, now I\xe2\x80\x99m with you, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know in the least what he is saying. This is not what he\r\nmeant to say. His arm is stealing round the waist again; it is\r\ntightening its clasp; he is bending his face nearer and nearer to the\r\nround cheek; his lips are meeting those pouting child-lips, and for a\r\nlong moment time has vanished. He may be a shepherd in Arcadia for\r\naught he knows, he may be the first youth kissing the first maiden, he\r\nmay be Eros himself, sipping the lips of Psyche\xe2\x80\x94it is all one.\r\n\r\nThere was no speaking for minutes after. They walked along with beating\r\nhearts till they came within sight of the gate at the end of the wood.\r\nThen they looked at each other, not quite as they had looked before,\r\nfor in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss.\r\n\r\nBut already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with the\r\nfountain of sweets: already Arthur was uncomfortable. He took his arm\r\nfrom Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, almost at the end of the\r\nGrove. I wonder how late it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pulling out his watch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty minutes past eight\xe2\x80\x94but my watch is too fast. However, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter not go any further now. Trot along quickly with your little\r\nfeet, and get home safely. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and looked at her half-sadly, half with a constrained\r\nsmile. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seemed to beseech him not to go away yet; but he\r\npatted her cheek and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d again. She was obliged to turn\r\naway from him and go on.\r\n\r\nAs for Arthur, he rushed back through the wood, as if he wanted to put\r\na wide space between himself and Hetty. He would not go to the\r\nHermitage again; he remembered how he had debated with himself there\r\nbefore dinner, and it had all come to nothing\xe2\x80\x94worse than nothing. He\r\nwalked right on into the Chase, glad to get out of the Grove, which\r\nsurely was haunted by his evil genius. Those beeches and smooth\r\nlimes\xe2\x80\x94there was something enervating in the very sight of them; but the\r\nstrong knotted old oaks had no bending languor in them\xe2\x80\x94the sight of\r\nthem would give a man some energy. Arthur lost himself among the narrow\r\nopenings in the fern, winding about without seeking any issue, till the\r\ntwilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs, and the hare\r\nlooked black as it darted across his path.\r\n\r\nHe was feeling much more strongly than he had done in the morning: it\r\nwas as if his horse had wheeled round from a leap and dared to dispute\r\nhis mastery. He was dissatisfied with himself, irritated, mortified. He\r\nno sooner fixed his mind on the probable consequences of giving way to\r\nthe emotions which had stolen over him to-day\xe2\x80\x94of continuing to notice\r\nHetty, of allowing himself any opportunity for such slight caresses as\r\nhe had been betrayed into already\xe2\x80\x94than he refused to believe such a\r\nfuture possible for himself. To flirt with Hetty was a very different\r\naffair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own station: that was\r\nunderstood to be an amusement on both sides, or, if it became serious,\r\nthere was no obstacle to marriage. But this little thing would be\r\nspoken ill of directly, if she happened to be seen walking with him;\r\nand then those excellent people, the Poysers, to whom a good name was\r\nas precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veins\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nshould hate himself if he made a scandal of that sort, on the estate\r\nthat was to be his own some day, and among tenants by whom he liked,\r\nabove all, to be respected. He could no more believe that he should so\r\nfall in his own esteem than that he should break both his legs and go\r\non crutches all the rest of his life. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine himself in\r\nthat position; it was too odious, too unlike him.\r\n\r\nAnd even if no one knew anything about it, they might get too fond of\r\neach other, and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting,\r\nafter all. No gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s niece.\r\nThere must be an end to the whole thing at once. It was too foolish.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he had been so determined this morning, before he went to\r\nGawaine\xe2\x80\x99s; and while he was there something had taken hold of him and\r\nmade him gallop back. It seemed he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite depend on his own\r\nresolution, as he had thought he could; he almost wished his arm would\r\nget painful again, and then he should think of nothing but the comfort\r\nit would be to get rid of the pain. There was no knowing what impulse\r\nmight seize him to-morrow, in this confounded place, where there was\r\nnothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong day. What could\r\nhe do to secure himself from any more of this folly?\r\n\r\nThere was but one resource. He would go and tell Irwine\xe2\x80\x94tell him\r\neverything. The mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial; the\r\ntemptation would vanish, as the charm of fond words vanishes when one\r\nrepeats them to the indifferent. In every way it would help him to tell\r\nIrwine. He would ride to Broxton Rectory the first thing after\r\nbreakfast to-morrow.\r\n\r\nArthur had no sooner come to this determination than he began to think\r\nwhich of the paths would lead him home, and made as short a walk\r\nthither as he could. He felt sure he should sleep now: he had had\r\nenough to tire him, and there was no more need for him to think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\nThe Return Home\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile that parting in the wood was happening, there was a parting in\r\nthe cottage too, and Lisbeth had stood with Adam at the door, straining\r\nher aged eyes to get the last glimpse of Seth and Dinah, as they\r\nmounted the opposite slope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, I\xe2\x80\x99m loath to see the last on her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Adam, as they\r\nturned into the house again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been willin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 her about me\r\ntill I died and went to lie by my old man. She\xe2\x80\x99d make it easier\r\ndyin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94she spakes so gentle an\xe2\x80\x99 moves about so still. I could be fast\r\nsure that pictur\xe2\x80\x99 was drawed for her i\xe2\x80\x99 thy new Bible\xe2\x80\x94th\xe2\x80\x99 angel\r\na-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 on the big stone by the grave. Eh, I wouldna mind ha\xe2\x80\x99in a\r\ndaughter like that; but nobody ne\xe2\x80\x99er marries them as is good for\r\naught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mother, I hope thee wilt have her for a daughter; for Seth\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\na liking for her, and I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll get a liking for Seth in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 use o\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99 a-that\xe2\x80\x99n? She caresna for Seth. She\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\naway twenty mile aff. How\xe2\x80\x99s she to get a likin\xe2\x80\x99 for him, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nknow? No more nor the cake \xe2\x80\x99ull come wi\xe2\x80\x99out the leaven. Thy figurin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbooks might ha\xe2\x80\x99 tould thee better nor that, I should think, else thee\r\nmightst as well read the commin print, as Seth allays does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthe figures tell us a fine deal,\r\nand we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go far without \xe2\x80\x99em, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us about\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nicer job to calculate _them_. But Seth\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\ngood-hearted a lad as ever handled a tool, and plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 sense, and\r\ngood-looking too; and he\xe2\x80\x99s got the same way o\xe2\x80\x99 thinking as Dinah. He\r\ndeserves to win her, though there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying she\xe2\x80\x99s a rare bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworkmanship. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see such women turned off the wheel every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, thee\xe2\x80\x99t allays stick up for thy brother. Thee\xe2\x80\x99st been just the\r\nsame, e\xe2\x80\x99er sin\xe2\x80\x99 ye war little uns together. Thee wart allays for\r\nhalving iverything wi\xe2\x80\x99 him. But what\xe2\x80\x99s Seth got to do with marryin\xe2\x80\x99, as\r\nis on\xe2\x80\x99y three-an\xe2\x80\x99-twenty? He\xe2\x80\x99d more need to learn an\xe2\x80\x99 lay by sixpence.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 as for his desarving her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s two \xe2\x80\x99ear older nor Seth: she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty near as old as thee. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the way; folks mun allays choose\r\nby contrairies, as if they must be sorted like the pork\xe2\x80\x94a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 good\r\nmeat wi\xe2\x80\x99 a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 offal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the feminine mind in some of its moods, all things that might be\r\nreceive a temporary charm from comparison with what is; and since Adam\r\ndid not want to marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt rather peevish on\r\nthat score\xe2\x80\x94as peevish as she would have been if he _had_ wanted to\r\nmarry her, and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership\r\nas effectually as by marrying Hetty.\r\n\r\nIt was more than half-past eight when Adam and his mother were talking\r\nin this way, so that when, about ten minutes later, Hetty reached the\r\nturning of the lane that led to the farmyard gate, she saw Dinah and\r\nSeth approaching it from the opposite direction, and waited for them to\r\ncome up to her. They, too, like Hetty, had lingered a little in their\r\nwalk, for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to\r\nSeth in these parting moments. But when they saw Hetty, they paused and\r\nshook hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as\r\nshe reached Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s very full of trouble to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what\r\nhad been said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling\r\nself-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s calm pitying face, with\r\nits open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets\r\nof its own, but in feelings which it longed to share with all the\r\nworld. Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman; how\r\nwas it possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind\r\nword for her when her aunt was finding fault, and who was always ready\r\nto take Totty off her hands\xe2\x80\x94little tiresome Totty, that was made such a\r\npet of by every one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all?\r\nDinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty\r\nduring her whole visit to the Hall Farm; she had talked to her a great\r\ndeal in a serious way, but Hetty didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that much, for she never\r\nlistened: whatever Dinah might say, she almost always stroked Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek after it, and wanted to do some mending for her. Dinah was a\r\nriddle to her; Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might\r\nimagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to\r\nbough, to look at the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark;\r\nbut she did not care to solve such riddles, any more than she cared to\r\nknow what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress, or in\r\nthe old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nDinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very happy to-night, dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall think of\r\nyou often when I\xe2\x80\x99m at Snowfield, and see your face before me as it is\r\nnow. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange thing\xe2\x80\x94sometimes when I\xe2\x80\x99m quite alone, sitting in my\r\nroom with my eyes closed, or walking over the hills, the people I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen and known, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only been for a few days, are brought before\r\nme, and I hear their voices and see them look and move almost plainer\r\nthan I ever did when they were really with me so as I could touch them.\r\nAnd then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot as if\r\nit was my own, and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and\r\nresting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own. And so I feel\r\nsure you will come before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, but Hetty said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a very precious time to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah went on, \xe2\x80\x9clast night\r\nand to-day\xe2\x80\x94seeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth Bede. They are so\r\ntender and thoughtful for their aged mother. And she has been telling\r\nme what Adam has done, for these many years, to help his father and his\r\nbrother; it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful what a spirit of wisdom and knowledge he has,\r\nand how he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to use it all in behalf of them that are feeble. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure he has a loving spirit too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed it often among my own\r\npeople round Snowfield, that the strong, skilful men are often the\r\ngentlest to the women and children; and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty to see \xe2\x80\x99em carrying\r\nthe little babies as if they were no heavier than little birds. And the\r\nbabies always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it would be\r\nso with Adam Bede. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty abstractedly, for her mind had been all the while in\r\nthe wood, and she would have found it difficult to say what she was\r\nassenting to. Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk, but there would\r\nnot have been time to say much more, for they were now at the\r\nyard-gate.\r\n\r\nThe still twilight, with its dying western red and its few faint\r\nstruggling stars, rested on the farm-yard, where there was not a sound\r\nto be heard but the stamping of the cart-horses in the stable. It was\r\nabout twenty minutes after sunset. The fowls were all gone to roost,\r\nand the bull-dog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel, with\r\nthe black-and-tan terrier by his side, when the falling-to of the gate\r\ndisturbed them and set them barking, like good officials, before they\r\nhad any distinct knowledge of the reason.\r\n\r\nThe barking had its effect in the house, for, as Dinah and Hetty\r\napproached, the doorway was filled by a portly figure, with a ruddy\r\nblack-eyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking extremely\r\nacute, and occasionally contemptuous, on market-days, but had now a\r\npredominant after-supper expression of hearty good-nature. It is well\r\nknown that great scholars who have shown the most pitiless acerbity in\r\ntheir criticism of other men\xe2\x80\x99s scholarship have yet been of a relenting\r\nand indulgent temper in private life; and I have heard of a learned man\r\nmeekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand, while with\r\nhis right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who\r\nhad betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew. Weaknesses and errors must\r\nbe forgiven\xe2\x80\x94alas! they are not alien to us\xe2\x80\x94but the man who takes the\r\nwrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be\r\ntreated as the enemy of his race. There was the same sort of antithetic\r\nmixture in Martin Poyser: he was of so excellent a disposition that he\r\nhad been kinder and more respectful than ever to his old father since\r\nhe had made a deed of gift of all his property, and no man judged his\r\nneighbours more charitably on all personal matters; but for a farmer,\r\nlike Luke Britton, for example, whose fallows were not well cleaned,\r\nwho didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the rudiments of hedging and ditching, and showed but a\r\nsmall share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock, Martin Poyser\r\nwas as hard and implacable as the north-east wind. Luke Britton could\r\nnot make a remark, even on the weather, but Martin Poyser detected in\r\nit a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable\r\nin all his farming operations. He hated to see the fellow lift the\r\npewter pint to his mouth in the bar of the Royal George on market-day,\r\nand the mere sight of him on the other side of the road brought a\r\nsevere and critical expression into his black eyes, as different as\r\npossible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as they\r\napproached the door. Mr. Poyser had smoked his evening pipe, and now\r\nheld his hands in his pockets, as the only resource of a man who\r\ncontinues to sit up after the day\xe2\x80\x99s business is done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, lasses, ye\xe2\x80\x99re rather late to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when they reached\r\nthe little gate leading into the causeway. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mother\xe2\x80\x99s begun to\r\nfidget about you, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s got the little un ill. An\xe2\x80\x99 how did you\r\nleave the old woman Bede, Dinah? Is she much down about the old man?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d been but a poor bargain to her this five year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been greatly distressed for the loss of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s seemed more comforted to-day. Her son Adam\xe2\x80\x99s been at home all\r\nday, working at his father\xe2\x80\x99s coffin, and she loves to have him at home.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about him to me almost all the day. She has a loving\r\nheart, though she\xe2\x80\x99s sorely given to fret and be fearful. I wish she had\r\na surer trust to comfort her in her old age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x99s sure enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, misunderstanding Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s wish.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no fear but he\xe2\x80\x99ll yield well i\xe2\x80\x99 the threshing. He\xe2\x80\x99s not one o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthem as is all straw and no grain. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bond for him any day, as\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good son to the last. Did he say he\xe2\x80\x99d be coming to see us\r\nsoon? But come in, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, making way for them; \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nneed keep y\xe2\x80\x99 out any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the sky, but\r\nthe large window let in abundant light to show every corner of the\r\nhouse-place.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, seated in the rocking-chair, which had been brought out of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cright-hand parlour,\xe2\x80\x9d was trying to soothe Totty to sleep. But\r\nTotty was not disposed to sleep; and when her cousins entered, she\r\nraised herself up and showed a pair of flushed cheeks, which looked\r\nfatter than ever now they were defined by the edge of her linen\r\nnight-cap.\r\n\r\nIn the large wicker-bottomed arm-chair in the left-hand chimney-nook\r\nsat old Martin Poyser, a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his\r\nportly black-haired son\xe2\x80\x94his head hanging forward a little, and his\r\nelbows pushed backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest\r\non the arm of the chair. His blue handkerchief was spread over his\r\nknees, as was usual indoors, when it was not hanging over his head; and\r\nhe sat watching what went forward with the quiet _outward_ glance of\r\nhealthy old age, which, disengaged from any interest in an inward\r\ndrama, spies out pins upon the floor, follows one\xe2\x80\x99s minutest motions\r\nwith an unexpectant purposeless tenacity, watches the flickering of the\r\nflame or the sun-gleams on the wall, counts the quarries on the floor,\r\nwatches even the hand of the clock, and pleases itself with detecting a\r\nrhythm in the tick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time o\xe2\x80\x99 night this is to come home, Hetty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the clock, do; why, it\xe2\x80\x99s going on for half-past nine, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsent the gells to bed this half-hour, and late enough too; when they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to get up at half after four, and the mowers\xe2\x80\x99 bottles to fill, and\r\nthe baking; and here\xe2\x80\x99s this blessed child wi\xe2\x80\x99 the fever for what I\r\nknow, and as wakeful as if it was dinner-time, and nobody to help me to\r\ngive her the physic but your uncle, and fine work there\xe2\x80\x99s been, and\r\nhalf of it spilt on her night-gown\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s well if she\xe2\x80\x99s swallowed more\r\nnor \xe2\x80\x99ull make her worse i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 better. But folks as have no mind to\r\nbe o\xe2\x80\x99 use have allays the luck to be out o\xe2\x80\x99 the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did set out before eight, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, in a pettish tone, with\r\na slight toss of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this clock\xe2\x80\x99s so much before the clock\r\nat the Chase, there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling what time it\xe2\x80\x99ll be when I get here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You\xe2\x80\x99d be wanting the clock set by gentlefolks\xe2\x80\x99s time, would you?\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 sit up burnin\xe2\x80\x99 candle, an\xe2\x80\x99 lie a-bed wi\xe2\x80\x99 the sun a-bakin\xe2\x80\x99 you like\r\na cowcumber i\xe2\x80\x99 the frame? The clock hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been put forrard for the\r\nfirst time to-day, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the clocks\r\nwhen she told Captain Donnithorne that she set out at eight, and this,\r\nwith her lingering pace, had made her nearly half an hour later than\r\nusual. But here her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s attention was diverted from this tender\r\nsubject by Totty, who, perceiving at length that the arrival of her\r\ncousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in\r\nparticular, began to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cMunny, munny,\xe2\x80\x9d in an explosive manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my pet, Mother\xe2\x80\x99s got her, Mother won\xe2\x80\x99t leave her; Totty be\r\na good dilling, and go to sleep now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, leaning back\r\nand rocking the chair, while she tried to make Totty nestle against\r\nher. But Totty only cried louder, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t yock!\xe2\x80\x9d So the\r\nmother, with that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest\r\ntemperament, sat up again, and pressed her cheek against the linen\r\nnight-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold Hetty any longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Poyser, in a conciliatory tone, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and get\r\nyour supper i\xe2\x80\x99 the pantry, as the things are all put away; an\xe2\x80\x99 then you\r\ncan come and take the little un while your aunt undresses herself, for\r\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t lie down in bed without her mother. An\xe2\x80\x99 I reckon _you_ could\r\neat a bit, Dinah, for they don\xe2\x80\x99t keep much of a house down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah; \xe2\x80\x9cI ate a good meal before I came\r\naway, for Mrs. Bede would make a kettle-cake for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, taking off her hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI can hold\r\nTotty now, if Aunt wants me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what nonsense that is to talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nyou can live wi\xe2\x80\x99out eatin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 nourish your inside wi\xe2\x80\x99 stickin\xe2\x80\x99 red\r\nribbons on your head? Go an\xe2\x80\x99 get your supper this minute, child;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a nice bit o\xe2\x80\x99 cold pudding i\xe2\x80\x99 the safe\xe2\x80\x94just what you\xe2\x80\x99re fond\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty complied silently by going towards the pantry, and Mrs. Poyser\r\nwent on speaking to Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, my dear, an\xe2\x80\x99 look as if you knowed what it was to make\r\nyourself a bit comfortable i\xe2\x80\x99 the world. I warrant the old woman was\r\nglad to see you, since you stayed so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to like having me there at last; but her sons say she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like young women about her commonly; and I thought just at\r\nfirst she was almost angry with me for going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor look-out when th\xe2\x80\x99 ould folks doesna like the young\r\nuns,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Martin, bending his head down lower, and seeming to\r\ntrace the pattern of the quarries with his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, it\xe2\x80\x99s ill livin\xe2\x80\x99 in a hen-roost for them as doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like fleas,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all had our turn at bein\xe2\x80\x99 young, I reckon,\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x99t good luck or ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she must learn to \xe2\x80\x99commodate herself to young women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPoyser, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be counted on as Adam and Seth \xe2\x80\x99ull keep\r\nbachelors for the next ten year to please their mother. That \xe2\x80\x99ud be\r\nunreasonable. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right for old nor young nayther to make a\r\nbargain all o\xe2\x80\x99 their own side. What\xe2\x80\x99s good for one\xe2\x80\x99s good all round i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe long run. I\xe2\x80\x99m no friend to young fellows a-marrying afore they know\r\nthe difference atween a crab an\xe2\x80\x99 a apple; but they may wait o\xe2\x80\x99er long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cif you go past your dinner-time,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be little relish o\xe2\x80\x99 your meat. You turn it o\xe2\x80\x99er an\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99er wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour fork, an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t eat it after all. You find faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 your meat, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe faut\xe2\x80\x99s all i\xe2\x80\x99 your own stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty now came back from the pantry and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can take Totty now,\r\nAunt, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, as his wife seemed to hesitate, seeing\r\nthat Totty was at last nestling quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x99dst better let Hetty\r\ncarry her upstairs, while thee tak\xe2\x80\x99st thy things off. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t tired.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time thee wast in bed. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t bring on the pain in thy side\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she may hold her if the child \xe2\x80\x99ull go to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser.\r\n\r\nHetty went close to the rocking-chair, and stood without her usual\r\nsmile, and without any attempt to entice Totty, simply waiting for her\r\naunt to give the child into her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilt go to Cousin Hetty, my dilling, while mother gets ready to go to\r\nbed? Then Totty shall go into Mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and sleep there all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore her mother had done speaking, Totty had given her answer in an\r\nunmistakable manner, by knitting her brow, setting her tiny teeth\r\nagainst her underlip, and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with\r\nher utmost force. Then, without speaking, she nestled to her mother\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, hey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, while Hetty stood without moving, \xe2\x80\x9cnot go\r\nto Cousin Hetty? That\xe2\x80\x99s like a babby. Totty\xe2\x80\x99s a little woman, an\xe2\x80\x99 not a\r\nbabby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use trying to persuade her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cShe allays\r\ntakes against Hetty when she isn\xe2\x80\x99t well. Happen she\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah, having taken off her bonnet and shawl, had hitherto kept quietly\r\nseated in the background, not liking to thrust herself between Hetty\r\nand what was considered Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s proper work. But now she came forward,\r\nand, putting out her arms, said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome Totty, come and let Dinah carry\r\nher upstairs along with Mother: poor, poor Mother! she\xe2\x80\x99s so tired\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwants to go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTotty turned her face towards Dinah, and looked at her an instant, then\r\nlifted herself up, put out her little arms, and let Dinah lift her from\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s lap. Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour,\r\nand, taking her hat from the table, stood waiting with an air of\r\nindifference, to see if she should be told to do anything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may make the door fast now, Poyser; Alick\xe2\x80\x99s been come in this long\r\nwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, rising with an appearance of relief from her\r\nlow chair. \xe2\x80\x9cGet me the matches down, Hetty, for I must have the\r\nrushlight burning i\xe2\x80\x99 my room. Come, Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and old Martin\r\nprepared to move, by gathering up his blue handkerchief, and reaching\r\nhis bright knobbed walnut-tree stick from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then\r\nled the way out of the kitchen, followed by the grandfather, and Dinah\r\nwith Totty in her arms\xe2\x80\x94all going to bed by twilight, like the birds.\r\nMrs. Poyser, on her way, peeped into the room where her two boys lay;\r\njust to see their ruddy round cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a\r\nmoment their light regular breathing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Hetty, get to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone, as he\r\nhimself turned to go upstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didna mean to be late, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound, but your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s been worrited to-day. Good-night, my wench,\r\ngood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\nThe Two Bed-Chambers\r\n\r\n\r\nHetty and Dinah both slept in the second story, in rooms adjoining each\r\nother, meagrely furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light,\r\nwhich was now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the\r\nmoon\xe2\x80\x94more than enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and\r\nundress with perfect comfort. She could see quite well the pegs in the\r\nold painted linen-press on which she hung her hat and gown; she could\r\nsee the head of every pin on her red cloth pin-cushion; she could see a\r\nreflection of herself in the old-fashioned looking-glass, quite as\r\ndistinct as was needful, considering that she had only to brush her\r\nhair and put on her night-cap. A queer old looking-glass! Hetty got\r\ninto an ill temper with it almost every time she dressed. It had been\r\nconsidered a handsome glass in its day, and had probably been bought\r\ninto the Poyser family a quarter of a century before, at a sale of\r\ngenteel household furniture. Even now an auctioneer could say something\r\nfor it: it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a\r\nfirm mahogany base, well supplied with drawers, which opened with a\r\ndecided jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest\r\ncorners, without giving you the trouble of reaching them; above all, it\r\nhad a brass candle-socket on each side, which would give it an\r\naristocratic air to the very last. But Hetty objected to it because it\r\nhad numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing\r\nwould remove, and because, instead of swinging backwards and forwards,\r\nit was fixed in an upright position, so that she could only get one\r\ngood view of her head and neck, and that was to be had only by sitting\r\ndown on a low chair before her dressing-table. And the dressing-table\r\nwas no dressing-table at all, but a small old chest of drawers, the\r\nmost awkward thing in the world to sit down before, for the big brass\r\nhandles quite hurt her knees, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get near the glass at\r\nall comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to\r\nprevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty this\r\nevening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual.\r\n\r\nHaving taken off her gown and white kerchief, she drew a key from the\r\nlarge pocket that hung outside her petticoat, and, unlocking one of the\r\nlower drawers in the chest, reached from it two short bits of wax\r\ncandle\xe2\x80\x94secretly bought at Treddleston\xe2\x80\x94and stuck them in the two brass\r\nsockets. Then she drew forth a bundle of matches and lighted the\r\ncandles; and last of all, a small red-framed shilling looking-glass,\r\nwithout blotches. It was into this small glass that she chose to look\r\nfirst after seating herself. She looked into it, smiling and turning\r\nher head on one side, for a minute, then laid it down and took out her\r\nbrush and comb from an upper drawer. She was going to let down her\r\nhair, and make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia\r\nDonnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room. It was soon done, and the dark hyacinthine\r\ncurves fell on her neck. It was not heavy, massive, merely rippling\r\nhair, but soft and silken, running at every opportunity into delicate\r\nrings. But she pushed it all backward to look like the picture, and\r\nform a dark curtain, throwing into relief her round white neck. Then\r\nshe put down her brush and comb and looked at herself, folding her arms\r\nbefore her, still like the picture. Even the old mottled glass couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp sending back a lovely image, none the less lovely because Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstays were not of white satin\xe2\x80\x94such as I feel sure heroines must\r\ngenerally wear\xe2\x80\x94but of a dark greenish cotton texture.\r\n\r\nOh yes! She was very pretty. Captain Donnithorne thought so. Prettier\r\nthan anybody about Hayslope\xe2\x80\x94prettier than any of the ladies she had\r\never seen visiting at the Chase\xe2\x80\x94indeed it seemed fine ladies were\r\nrather old and ugly\xe2\x80\x94and prettier than Miss Bacon, the miller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, who was called the beauty of Treddleston. And Hetty looked at\r\nherself to-night with quite a different sensation from what she had\r\never felt before; there was an invisible spectator whose eye rested on\r\nher like morning on the flowers. His soft voice was saying over and\r\nover again those pretty things she had heard in the wood; his arm was\r\nround her, and the delicate rose-scent of his hair was with her still.\r\nThe vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till\r\nshe is loved by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return.\r\n\r\nBut Hetty seemed to have made up her mind that something was wanting,\r\nfor she got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the\r\nlinen-press, and a pair of large ear-rings out of the sacred drawer\r\nfrom which she had taken her candles. It was an old old scarf, full of\r\nrents, but it would make a becoming border round her shoulders, and set\r\noff the whiteness of her upper arm. And she would take out the little\r\near-rings she had in her ears\xe2\x80\x94oh, how her aunt had scolded her for\r\nhaving her ears bored!\xe2\x80\x94and put in those large ones. They were but\r\ncoloured glass and gilding, but if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were made\r\nof, they looked just as well as what the ladies wore. And so she sat\r\ndown again, with the large ear-rings in her ears, and the black lace\r\nscarf adjusted round her shoulders. She looked down at her arms: no\r\narms could be prettier down to a little way below the elbow\xe2\x80\x94they were\r\nwhite and plump, and dimpled to match her cheeks; but towards the\r\nwrist, she thought with vexation that they were coarsened by\r\nbutter-making and other work that ladies never did.\r\n\r\nCaptain Donnithorne couldn\xe2\x80\x99t like her to go on doing work: he would\r\nlike to see her in nice clothes, and thin shoes, and white stockings,\r\nperhaps with silk clocks to them; for he must love her very much\xe2\x80\x94no one\r\nelse had ever put his arm round her and kissed her in that way. He\r\nwould want to marry her and make a lady of her; she could hardly dare\r\nto shape the thought\xe2\x80\x94yet how else could it be? Marry her quite\r\nsecretly, as Mr. James, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, married the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nniece, and nobody ever found it out for a long while after, and then it\r\nwas of no use to be angry. The doctor had told her aunt all about it in\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how it would be, but it was quite\r\nplain the old Squire could never be told anything about it, for Hetty\r\nwas ready to faint with awe and fright if she came across him at the\r\nChase. He might have been earth-born, for what she knew. It had never\r\nentered her mind that he had been young like other men; he had always\r\nbeen the old Squire at whom everybody was frightened. Oh, it was\r\nimpossible to think how it would be! But Captain Donnithorne would\r\nknow; he was a great gentleman, and could have his way in everything,\r\nand could buy everything he liked. And nothing could be as it had been\r\nagain: perhaps some day she should be a grand lady, and ride in her\r\ncoach, and dress for dinner in a brocaded silk, with feathers in her\r\nhair, and her dress sweeping the ground, like Miss Lydia and Lady\r\nDacey, when she saw them going into the dining-room one evening as she\r\npeeped through the little round window in the lobby; only she should\r\nnot be old and ugly like Miss Lydia, or all the same thickness like\r\nLady Dacey, but very pretty, with her hair done in a great many\r\ndifferent ways, and sometimes in a pink dress, and sometimes in a white\r\none\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which she liked best; and Mary Burge and everybody\r\nwould perhaps see her going out in her carriage\xe2\x80\x94or rather, they would\r\n_hear_ of it: it was impossible to imagine these things happening at\r\nHayslope in sight of her aunt. At the thought of all this splendour,\r\nHetty got up from her chair, and in doing so caught the little\r\nred-framed glass with the edge of her scarf, so that it fell with a\r\nbang on the floor; but she was too eagerly occupied with her vision to\r\ncare about picking it up; and after a momentary start, began to pace\r\nwith a pigeon-like stateliness backwards and forwards along her room,\r\nin her coloured stays and coloured skirt, and the old black lace scarf\r\nround her shoulders, and the great glass ear-rings in her ears.\r\n\r\nHow pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress! It would be the\r\neasiest folly in the world to fall in love with her: there is such a\r\nsweet babylike roundness about her face and figure; the delicate dark\r\nrings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck; her great dark\r\neyes with their long eye-lashes touch one so strangely, as if an\r\nimprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them.\r\n\r\nAh, what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like Hetty! How\r\nthe men envy him who come to the wedding breakfast, and see her hanging\r\non his arm in her white lace and orange blossoms. The dear, young,\r\nround, soft, flexible thing! Her heart must be just as soft, her temper\r\njust as free from angles, her character just as pliant. If anything\r\never goes wrong, it must be the husband\xe2\x80\x99s fault there: he can make her\r\nwhat he likes\xe2\x80\x94that is plain. And the lover himself thinks so too: the\r\nlittle darling is so fond of him, her little vanities are so\r\nbewitching, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consent to her being a bit wiser; those\r\nkittenlike glances and movements are just what one wants to make one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearth a paradise. Every man under such circumstances is conscious of\r\nbeing a great physiognomist. Nature, he knows, has a language of her\r\nown, which she uses with strict veracity, and he considers himself an\r\nadept in the language. Nature has written out his bride\xe2\x80\x99s character for\r\nhim in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip and chin, in those\r\neyelids delicate as petals, in those long lashes curled like the stamen\r\nof a flower, in the dark liquid depths of those wonderful eyes. How she\r\nwill dote on her children! She is almost a child herself, and the\r\nlittle pink round things will hang about her like florets round the\r\ncentral flower; and the husband will look on, smiling benignly, able,\r\nwhenever he chooses, to withdraw into the sanctuary of his wisdom,\r\ntowards which his sweet wife will look reverently, and never lift the\r\ncurtain. It is a marriage such as they made in the golden age, when the\r\nmen were all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving.\r\n\r\nIt was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede thought about\r\nHetty; only he put his thoughts into different words. If ever she\r\nbehaved with cold vanity towards him, he said to himself it is only\r\nbecause she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love me well enough; and he was sure that her love,\r\nwhenever she gave it, would be the most precious thing a man could\r\npossess on earth. Before you despise Adam as deficient in penetration,\r\npray ask yourself if you were ever predisposed to believe evil of any\r\npretty woman\xe2\x80\x94if you ever _could_, without hard head-breaking\r\ndemonstration, believe evil of the _one_ supremely pretty woman who has\r\nbewitched you. No: people who love downy peaches are apt not to think\r\nof the stone, and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it.\r\n\r\nArthur Donnithorne, too, had the same sort of notion about Hetty, so\r\nfar as he had thought of her nature of all. He felt sure she was a\r\ndear, affectionate, good little thing. The man who awakes the wondering\r\ntremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her affectionate; and\r\nif he chances to look forward to future years, probably imagines\r\nhimself being virtuously tender to her, because the poor thing is so\r\nclingingly fond of him. God made these dear women so\xe2\x80\x94and it is a\r\nconvenient arrangement in case of sickness.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way\r\nsometimes, and must think both better and worse of people than they\r\ndeserve. Nature has her language, and she is not unveracious; but we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know all the intricacies of her syntax just yet, and in a hasty\r\nreading we may happen to extract the very opposite of her real meaning.\r\nLong dark eyelashes, now\xe2\x80\x94what can be more exquisite? I find it\r\nimpossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with\r\na long dark eyelash, in spite of an experience which has shown me that\r\nthey may go along with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in\r\nthe reaction of disgust, I have betaken myself to a fishy eye, there\r\nhas been a surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at\r\nlength that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and\r\nmorals; or else, that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother, which is on the whole less important to us.\r\n\r\nNo eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s; and now, while she\r\nwalks with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on\r\nher shoulders bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to\r\nperfection on her pink cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures\r\nthat her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of\r\nevery picture she is the central figure in fine clothes; Captain\r\nDonnithorne is very close to her, putting his arm round her, perhaps\r\nkissing her, and everybody else is admiring and envying her\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nMary Burge, whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side\r\nof Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle\r\nwith this dream of the future\xe2\x80\x94any loving thought of her second\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x94of the children she had helped to tend\xe2\x80\x94of any youthful\r\ncompanion, any pet animal, any relic of her own childhood even? Not\r\none. There are some plants that have hardly any roots: you may tear\r\nthem from their native nook of rock or wall, and just lay them over\r\nyour ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the worse. Hetty\r\ncould have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be\r\nreminded of it again. I think she had no feeling at all towards the old\r\nhouse, and did not like the Jacobb\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder and the long row of\r\nhollyhocks in the garden better than other flowers\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not so well.\r\nIt was wonderful how little she seemed to care about waiting on her\r\nuncle, who had been a good father to her\xe2\x80\x94she hardly ever remembered to\r\nreach him his pipe at the right time without being told, unless a\r\nvisitor happened to be there, who would have a better opportunity of\r\nseeing her as she walked across the hearth. Hetty did not understand\r\nhow anybody could be very fond of middle-aged people. And as for those\r\ntiresome children, Marty and Tommy and Totty, they had been the very\r\nnuisance of her life\xe2\x80\x94as bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing\r\nyou on a hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the eldest, was a\r\nbaby when she first came to the farm, for the children born before him\r\nhad died, and so Hetty had had them all three, one after the other,\r\ntoddling by her side in the meadow, or playing about her on wet days in\r\nthe half-empty rooms of the large old house. The boys were out of hand\r\nnow, but Totty was still a day-long plague, worse than either of the\r\nothers had been, because there was more fuss made about her. And there\r\nwas no end to the making and mending of clothes. Hetty would have been\r\nglad to hear that she should never see a child again; they were worse\r\nthan the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to\r\nbe taken special care of in lambing time; for the lambs _were_ got rid\r\nof sooner or later. As for the young chickens and turkeys, Hetty would\r\nhave hated the very word \xe2\x80\x9chatching,\xe2\x80\x9d if her aunt had not bribed her to\r\nattend to the young poultry by promising her the proceeds of one out of\r\nevery brood. The round downy chicks peeping out from under their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s wing never touched Hetty with any pleasure; that was not the\r\nsort of prettiness she cared about, but she did care about the\r\nprettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston\r\nFair with the money they fetched. And yet she looked so dimpled, so\r\ncharming, as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the\r\nhen-coop, that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to\r\nsuspect her of that hardness. Molly, the housemaid, with a turn-up nose\r\nand a protuberant jaw, was really a tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs.\r\nPoyser said, a jewel to look after the poultry; but her stolid face\r\nshowed nothing of this maternal delight, any more than a brown\r\nearthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.\r\n\r\nIt is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral\r\ndeficiencies hidden under the \xe2\x80\x9cdear deceit\xe2\x80\x9d of beauty, so it is not\r\nsurprising that Mrs. Poyser, with her keenness and abundant opportunity\r\nfor observation, should have formed a tolerably fair estimate of what\r\nmight be expected from Hetty in the way of feeling, and in moments of\r\nindignation she had sometimes spoken with great openness on the subject\r\nto her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s no better than a peacock, as \xe2\x80\x99ud strut about on the wall and\r\nspread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish was\r\ndying: there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing seems to give her a turn i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 inside, not even\r\nwhen we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit. To think o\xe2\x80\x99 that dear\r\ncherub! And we found her wi\xe2\x80\x99 her little shoes stuck i\xe2\x80\x99 the mud an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncrying fit to break her heart by the far horse-pit. But Hetty never\r\nminded it, I could see, though she\xe2\x80\x99s been at the nussin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the child\r\never since it was a babby. It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief her heart\xe2\x80\x99s as hard as a\r\npebble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cthee mustn\xe2\x80\x99t judge Hetty too hard. Them\r\nyoung gells are like the unripe grain; they\xe2\x80\x99ll make good meal by and\r\nby, but they\xe2\x80\x99re squashy as yet. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t see Hetty \xe2\x80\x99ll be all right when\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s got a good husband and children of her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be hard upo\xe2\x80\x99 the gell. She\xe2\x80\x99s got cliver fingers of\r\nher own, and can be useful enough when she likes and I should miss her\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 the butter, for she\xe2\x80\x99s got a cool hand. An\xe2\x80\x99 let be what may, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstrive to do my part by a niece o\xe2\x80\x99 yours\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntaught her everything as belongs to a house, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her her duty\r\noften enough, though, God knows, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no breath to spare, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\ncatchin\xe2\x80\x99 pain comes on dreadful by times. Wi\xe2\x80\x99 them three gells in the\r\nhouse I\xe2\x80\x99d need have twice the strength to keep \xe2\x80\x99em up to their work.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like having roast meat at three fires; as soon as you\xe2\x80\x99ve basted\r\none, another\xe2\x80\x99s burnin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty stood sufficiently in awe of her aunt to be anxious to conceal\r\nfrom her so much of her vanity as could be hidden without too great a\r\nsacrifice. She could not resist spending her money in bits of finery\r\nwhich Mrs. Poyser disapproved; but she would have been ready to die\r\nwith shame, vexation, and fright if her aunt had this moment opened the\r\ndoor, and seen her with her bits of candle lighted, and strutting about\r\ndecked in her scarf and ear-rings. To prevent such a surprise, she\r\nalways bolted her door, and she had not forgotten to do so to-night. It\r\nwas well: for there now came a light tap, and Hetty, with a leaping\r\nheart, rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer.\r\nShe dared not stay to take out her ear-rings, but she threw off her\r\nscarf, and let it fall on the floor, before the light tap came again.\r\nWe shall know how it was that the light tap came, if we leave Hetty for\r\na short time and return to Dinah, at the moment when she had delivered\r\nTotty to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and was come upstairs to her bedroom,\r\nadjoining Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nDinah delighted in her bedroom window. Being on the second story of\r\nthat tall house, it gave her a wide view over the fields. The thickness\r\nof the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the window, where\r\nshe could place her chair. And now the first thing she did on entering\r\nher room was to seat herself in this chair and look out on the peaceful\r\nfields beyond which the large moon was rising, just above the hedgerow\r\nelms. She liked the pasture best where the milch cows were lying, and\r\nnext to that the meadow where the grass was half-mown, and lay in\r\nsilvered sweeping lines. Her heart was very full, for there was to be\r\nonly one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a\r\nlong time to come; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene,\r\nfor, to her, bleak Snowfield had just as many charms. She thought of\r\nall the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these\r\npeaceful fields, and who would now have a place in her loving\r\nremembrance for ever. She thought of the struggles and the weariness\r\nthat might lie before them in the rest of their life\xe2\x80\x99s journey, when\r\nshe would be away from them, and know nothing of what was befalling\r\nthem; and the pressure of this thought soon became too strong for her\r\nto enjoy the unresponding stillness of the moonlit fields. She closed\r\nher eyes, that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and\r\nSympathy deeper and more tender than was breathed from the earth and\r\nsky. That was often Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s mode of praying in solitude. Simply to\r\nclose her eyes and to feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence;\r\nthen gradually her fears, her yearning anxieties for others, melted\r\naway like ice-crystals in a warm ocean. She had sat in this way\r\nperfectly still, with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light\r\nresting on her calm face, for at least ten minutes when she was\r\nstartled by a loud sound, apparently of something falling in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a state of\r\nabstraction, it had no distinct character, but was simply loud and\r\nstartling, so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it\r\nrightly. She rose and listened, but all was quiet afterwards, and she\r\nreflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in\r\ngetting into bed. She began slowly to undress; but now, owing to the\r\nsuggestions of this sound, her thoughts became concentrated on\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x94that sweet young thing, with life and all its trials before\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94the solemn daily duties of the wife and mother\xe2\x80\x94and her mind so\r\nunprepared for them all, bent merely on little foolish, selfish\r\npleasures, like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long\r\ntoilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and\r\nunsheltered darkness. Dinah felt a double care for Hetty, because she\r\nshared Seth\xe2\x80\x99s anxious interest in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s lot, and she had not\r\ncome to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to\r\nmarry him. She saw too clearly the absence of any warm, self-devoting\r\nlove in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards\r\nAdam as any indication that he was not the man she would like to have\r\nfor a husband. And this blank in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s nature, instead of exciting\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s dislike, only touched her with a deeper pity: the lovely face\r\nand form affected her as beauty always affects a pure and tender mind,\r\nfree from selfish jealousies. It was an excellent divine gift, that\r\ngave a deeper pathos to the need, the sin, the sorrow with which it was\r\nmingled, as the canker in a lily-white bud is more grievous to behold\r\nthan in a common pot-herb.\r\n\r\nBy the time Dinah had undressed and put on her night-gown, this feeling\r\nabout Hetty had gathered a painful intensity; her imagination had\r\ncreated a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow, in which she saw the poor\r\nthing struggling torn and bleeding, looking with tears for rescue and\r\nfinding none. It was in this way that Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s imagination and sympathy\r\nacted and reacted habitually, each heightening the other. She felt a\r\ndeep longing to go now and pour into Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s ear all the words of\r\ntender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind. But perhaps Hetty\r\nwas already asleep. Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard still\r\nsome slight noises, which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed.\r\nStill she hesitated; she was not quite certain of a divine direction;\r\nthe voice that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger than the\r\nother voice which said that Hetty was weary, and that going to her now\r\nin an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more\r\nobstinately. Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable\r\nguidance than those inward voices. There was light enough for her, if\r\nshe opened her Bible, to discern the text sufficiently to know what it\r\nwould say to her. She knew the physiognomy of every page, and could\r\ntell on what book she opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing\r\ntitle or number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the\r\nedges. Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was\r\nstrongest, and then opened it with her forefinger. The first words she\r\nlooked at were those at the top of the left-hand page: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they all\r\nwept sore, and fell on Paul\xe2\x80\x99s neck and kissed him.\xe2\x80\x9d That was enough for\r\nDinah; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus, when Paul\r\nhad felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning. She\r\nhesitated no longer, but, opening her own door gently, went and tapped\r\non Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s. We know she had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out\r\nher candles and throw off her black lace scarf; but after the second\r\ntap the door was opened immediately. Dinah said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me come\r\nin, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d and Hetty, without speaking, for she was confused and\r\nvexed, opened the door wider and let her in.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in that\r\nmingled twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her cheeks flushed and her eyes\r\nglistening from her imaginary drama, her beautiful neck and arms bare,\r\nher hair hanging in a curly tangle down her back, and the baubles in\r\nher ears. Dinah, covered with her long white dress, her pale face full\r\nof subdued emotion, almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has\r\nreturned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love. They were\r\nnearly of the same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she\r\nput her arm round Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s waist and kissed her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were not in bed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her sweet clear\r\nvoice, which was irritating to Hetty, mingling with her own peevish\r\nvexation like music with jangling chains, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I heard you moving; and\r\nI longed to speak to you again to-night, for it is the last but one\r\nthat I shall be here, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may happen to-morrow to\r\nkeep us apart. Shall I sit down with you while you do up your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, hastily turning round and reaching the second\r\nchair in the room, glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her\r\near-rings.\r\n\r\nDinah sat down, and Hetty began to brush together her hair before\r\ntwisting it up, doing it with that air of excessive indifference which\r\nbelongs to confused self-consciousness. But the expression of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes gradually relieved her; they seemed unobservant of all details.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been borne in upon my mind to-night\r\nthat you may some day be in trouble\xe2\x80\x94trouble is appointed for us all\r\nhere below, and there comes a time when we need more comfort and help\r\nthan the things of this life can give. I want to tell you that if ever\r\nyou are in trouble, and need a friend that will always feel for you and\r\nlove you, you have got that friend in Dinah Morris at Snowfield, and if\r\nyou come to her, or send for her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget this night and\r\nthe words she is speaking to you now. Will you remember it, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, rather frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you think I shall\r\nbe in trouble? Do you know of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap, and now Dinah leaned\r\nforwards and took her hands as she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, dear, trouble\r\ncomes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things which it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t God\xe2\x80\x99s will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing; the people\r\nwe love are taken from us, and we can joy in nothing because they are\r\nnot with us; sickness comes, and we faint under the burden of our\r\nfeeble bodies; we go astray and do wrong, and bring ourselves into\r\ntrouble with our fellow-men. There is no man or woman born into this\r\nworld to whom some of these trials do not fall, and so I feel that some\r\nof them must happen to you; and I desire for you, that while you are\r\nyoung you should seek for strength from your Heavenly Father, that you\r\nmay have a support which will not fail you in the evil day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah paused and released Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s hands that she might not hinder her.\r\nHetty sat quite still; she felt no response within herself to Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxious affection; but Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s words uttered with solemn pathetic\r\ndistinctness, affected her with a chill fear. Her flush had died away\r\nalmost to paleness; she had the timidity of a luxurious\r\npleasure-seeking nature, which shrinks from the hint of pain. Dinah saw\r\nthe effect, and her tender anxious pleading became the more earnest,\r\ntill Hetty, full of a vague fear that something evil was some time to\r\nbefall her, began to cry.\r\n\r\nIt is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand\r\nthe higher, the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower.\r\nBut I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension, as we\r\nlearn the art of vision, by a good deal of hard experience, often with\r\nbruises and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end, and\r\nfancying our space wider than it is. Dinah had never seen Hetty\r\naffected in this way before, and, with her usual benignant hopefulness,\r\nshe trusted it was the stirring of a divine impulse. She kissed the\r\nsobbing thing, and began to cry with her for grateful joy. But Hetty\r\nwas simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no\r\ncalculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another,\r\nand for the first time she became irritated under Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s caress. She\r\npushed her away impatiently, and said, with a childish sobbing voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me so, Dinah. Why do you come to frighten me? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\ndone anything to you. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you let me be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Dinah felt a pang. She was too wise to persist, and only said\r\nmildly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re tired; I won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder you any longer.\r\nMake haste and get into bed. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had\r\nbeen a ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw herself on\r\nher knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that\r\nfilled her heart.\r\n\r\nAs for Hetty, she was soon in the wood again\xe2\x80\x94her waking dreams being\r\nmerged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\nLinks\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Donnithorne, you remember, is under an engagement with himself\r\nto go and see Mr. Irwine this Friday morning, and he is awake and\r\ndressing so early that he determines to go before breakfast, instead of\r\nafter. The rector, he knows, breakfasts alone at half-past nine, the\r\nladies of the family having a different breakfast-hour; Arthur will\r\nhave an early ride over the hill and breakfast with him. One can say\r\neverything best over a meal.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization has made a breakfast or a dinner an easy\r\nand cheerful substitute for more troublesome and disagreeable\r\nceremonies. We take a less gloomy view of our errors now our father\r\nconfessor listens to us over his egg and coffee. We are more distinctly\r\nconscious that rude penances are out of the question for gentlemen in\r\nan enlightened age, and that mortal sin is not incompatible with an\r\nappetite for muffins. An assault on our pockets, which in more\r\nbarbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a\r\npistol-shot, is quite a well-bred and smiling procedure now it has\r\nbecome a request for a loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between\r\nthe second and third glasses of claret.\r\n\r\nStill, there was this advantage in the old rigid forms, that they\r\ncommitted you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed:\r\nwhen you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and\r\nare aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end, you are more\r\nlikely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if\r\nyou were seated with your legs in an easy attitude under the mahogany\r\nwith a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have\r\nnothing particular to say.\r\n\r\nHowever, Arthur Donnithorne, as he winds among the pleasant lanes on\r\nhorseback in the morning sunshine, has a sincere determination to open\r\nhis heart to the rector, and the swirling sound of the scythe as he\r\npasses by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this\r\nhonest purpose. He is glad to see the promise of settled weather now,\r\nfor getting in the hay, about which the farmers have been fearful; and\r\nthere is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general\r\nand not merely personal, that this thought about the hay-harvest reacts\r\non his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier matter. A\r\nman about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not to\r\nbe felt out of a child\xe2\x80\x99s story-book; but when you are among the fields\r\nand hedgerows, it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to\r\nsimple natural pleasures.\r\n\r\nArthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the\r\nBroxton side of the hill, when, at a turning in the road, he saw a\r\nfigure about a hundred yards before him which it was impossible to\r\nmistake for any one else than Adam Bede, even if there had been no\r\ngrey, tailless shepherd-dog at his heels. He was striding along at his\r\nusual rapid pace, and Arthur pushed on his horse to overtake him, for\r\nhe retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss an\r\nopportunity of chatting with him. I will not say that his love for that\r\ngood fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage: our\r\nfriend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome, and to have his\r\nhandsome deeds recognized.\r\n\r\nAdam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheels, and waited for the horseman, lifting his paper cap from his head\r\nwith a bright smile of recognition. Next to his own brother Seth, Adam\r\nwould have done more for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young\r\nman in the world. There was hardly anything he would not rather have\r\nlost than the two-feet ruler which he always carried in his pocket; it\r\nwas Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s present, bought with his pocket-money when he was a\r\nfair-haired lad of eleven, and when he had profited so well by Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the\r\nhouse with gifts of superfluous thread-reels and round boxes. Adam had\r\nquite a pride in the little squire in those early days, and the feeling\r\nhad only become slightly modified as the fair-haired lad had grown into\r\nthe whiskered young man. Adam, I confess, was very susceptible to the\r\ninfluence of rank, and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect\r\nto every one who had more advantages than himself, not being a\r\nphilosopher or a proletaire with democratic ideas, but simply a\r\nstout-limbed clever carpenter with a large fund of reverence in his\r\nnature, which inclined him to admit all established claims unless he\r\nsaw very clear grounds for questioning them. He had no theories about\r\nsetting the world to rights, but he saw there was a great deal of\r\ndamage done by building with ill-seasoned timber\xe2\x80\x94by ignorant men in\r\nfine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like\r\nwithout knowing the bearings of things\xe2\x80\x94by slovenly joiners\xe2\x80\x99 work, and\r\nby hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining\r\nsomebody; and he resolved, for his part, to set his face against such\r\ndoings. On these points he would have maintained his opinion against\r\nthe largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either; but he\r\nfelt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people\r\nwho were more knowing than himself. He saw as plainly as possible how\r\nill the woods on the estate were managed, and the shameful state of the\r\nfarm-buildings; and if old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect\r\nof this mismanagement, he would have spoken his opinion without\r\nflinching, but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d would have been strong within him all the while. The word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d had a spell for Adam, and, as he often said, he \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nabide a fellow who thought he made himself fine by being coxy to\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetters.\xe2\x80\x9d I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the\r\npeasant in his veins, and that since he was in his prime half a century\r\nago, you must expect some of his characteristics to be obsolete.\r\n\r\nTowards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\nassisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that\r\nhe thought far more of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities, and attached far more\r\nvalue to very slight actions of his, than if they had been the\r\nqualities and actions of a common workman like himself. He felt sure it\r\nwould be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope when the young squire\r\ncame into the estate\xe2\x80\x94such a generous open-hearted disposition as he\r\nhad, and an \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon\xe2\x80\x9d notion about improvements and repairs,\r\nconsidering he was only just coming of age. Thus there was both respect\r\nand affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur\r\nDonnithorne rode up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Adam, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, holding out his hand. He never\r\nshook hands with any of the farmers, and Adam felt the honour keenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could swear to your back a long way off. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the same back,\r\nonly broader, as when you used to carry me on it. Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, sir, I remember. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a poor look-out if folks didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember what they did and said when they were lads. We should think no\r\nmore about old friends than we do about new uns, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to Broxton, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, putting his horse on\r\nat a slow pace while Adam walked by his side. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to the\r\nrectory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see about Bradwell\xe2\x80\x99s barn. They\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of the\r\nroof pushing the walls out, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see what can be done with\r\nit before we send the stuff and the workmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Burge trusts almost everything to you now, Adam, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he? I\r\nshould think he will make you his partner soon. He will, if he\xe2\x80\x99s wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see as he\xe2\x80\x99d be much the better off for that. A\r\nforeman, if he\xe2\x80\x99s got a conscience and delights in his work, will do his\r\nbusiness as well as if he was a partner. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a penny for a\r\nman as \xe2\x80\x99ud drive a nail in slack because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get extra pay for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, Adam; I know you work for him as well as if you were\r\nworking for yourself. But you would have more power than you have now,\r\nand could turn the business to better account perhaps. The old man must\r\ngive up his business sometime, and he has no son; I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll want\r\na son-in-law who can take to it. But he has rather grasping fingers of\r\nhis own, I fancy. I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into\r\nthe business. If I were not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest\r\nsome money in that way, for the sake of having you settled on the\r\nestate. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall\r\nbe better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nof age; and when I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look\r\nabout me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very good to say so, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not unthankful. But\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Adam\r\ncontinued, in a decided tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to make any offers to\r\nMr. Burge, or t\xe2\x80\x99 have any made for me. I see no clear road to a\r\npartnership. If he should ever want to dispose of the business, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be a different matter. I should be glad of some money at a fair\r\ninterest then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine had said\r\nabout a probable hitch in the love-making between Adam and Mary Burge,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more about it at present. When is your father to be\r\nburied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s coming earlier on purpose. I shall be\r\nglad when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, for I think my mother \xe2\x80\x99ull perhaps get easier\r\nthen. It cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people; they\xe2\x80\x99ve no way\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 working it off, and the new spring brings no new shoots out on the\r\nwithered tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life, Adam.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been hare-brained and light-hearted, like\r\nother youngsters. You\xe2\x80\x99ve always had some care on your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, sir; but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to make a fuss about. If we\xe2\x80\x99re men\r\nand have men\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, I reckon we must have men\xe2\x80\x99s troubles. We can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe like the birds, as fly from their nest as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99ve got their\r\nwings, and never know their kin when they see \xe2\x80\x99em, and get a fresh lot\r\nevery year. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough to be thankful for: I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays had health\r\nand strength and brains to give me a delight in my work; and I count it\r\na great thing as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had Bartle Massey\xe2\x80\x99s night-school to go to. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelped me to knowledge I could never ha\xe2\x80\x99 got by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a rare fellow you are, Adam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, after a pause, in\r\nwhich he had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncould hit out better than most men at Oxford, and yet I believe you\r\nwould knock me into next week if I were to have a battle with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid I should ever do that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking round at\r\nArthur and smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to fight for fun, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that\r\nsince I was the cause o\xe2\x80\x99 poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a\r\nfortnight. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never fight any man again, only when he behaves like a\r\nscoundrel. If you get hold of a chap that\xe2\x80\x99s got no shame nor conscience\r\nto stop him, you must try what you can do by bunging his eyes up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur did not laugh, for he was preoccupied with some thought that\r\nmade him say presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think now, Adam, you never have any\r\nstruggles within yourself. I fancy you would master a wish that you had\r\nmade up your mind it was not quite right to indulge, as easily as you\r\nwould knock down a drunken fellow who was quarrelsome with you. I mean,\r\nyou are never shilly-shally, first making up your mind that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo a thing, and then doing it after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, slowly, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cno. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember ever being see-saw in that way, when I\xe2\x80\x99d made my mind up, as\r\nyou say, that a thing was wrong. It takes the taste out o\xe2\x80\x99 my mouth for\r\nthings, when I know I should have a heavy conscience after \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen pretty clear, ever since I could cast up a sum, as you can never\r\ndo what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong without breeding sin and trouble more than you can ever\r\nsee. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 bad workmanship\xe2\x80\x94you never see th\xe2\x80\x99 end o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nmischief it\xe2\x80\x99ll do. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor look-out to come into the world to\r\nmake your fellow-creatures worse off instead o\xe2\x80\x99 better. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndifference between the things folks call wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m not for making a\r\nsin of every little fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick, or bit o\xe2\x80\x99 nonsense anybody may be let\r\ninto, like some o\xe2\x80\x99 them dissenters. And a man may have two minds\r\nwhether it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 fun. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my way to be see-saw about anything: I think\r\nmy fault lies th\xe2\x80\x99 other way. When I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a thing, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only to\r\nmyself, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I expected of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\r\niron will, as well as an iron arm. But however strong a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution may be, it costs him something to carry it out, now and\r\nthen. We may determine not to gather any cherries and keep our hands\r\nsturdily in our pockets, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent our mouths from\r\nwatering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, sir, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like settling with ourselves as\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a deal we must do without i\xe2\x80\x99 this life. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use looking on\r\nlife as if it was Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on Fair, where folks only go to see shows\r\nand get fairings. If we do, we shall find it different. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nuse o\xe2\x80\x99 me talking to you, sir? You know better than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure of that, Adam. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had four or five years of\r\nexperience more than I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and I think your life has been a better\r\nschool to you than college has been to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, you seem to think o\xe2\x80\x99 college something like what Bartle\r\nMassey does. He says college mostly makes people like bladders\xe2\x80\x94just\r\ngood for nothing but t\xe2\x80\x99 hold the stuff as is poured into \xe2\x80\x99em. But he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot a tongue like a sharp blade, Bartle has\xe2\x80\x94it never touches anything\r\nbut it cuts. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the turning, sir. I must bid you good-morning, as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to the rectory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Adam, good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and walked\r\nalong the gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew\r\nthat the rector always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on\r\nthe left hand of this door, opposite the dining-room. It was a small\r\nlow room, belonging to the old part of the house\xe2\x80\x94dark with the sombre\r\ncovers of the books that lined the walls; yet it looked very cheery\r\nthis morning as Arthur reached the open window. For the morning sun\r\nfell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it, which stood\r\non a scagliola pillar in front of the ready-spread bachelor\r\nbreakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group\r\nwhich would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask\r\neasy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always\r\nhad when he came from his morning toilet; his finely formed plump white\r\nhand was playing along Juno\xe2\x80\x99s brown curly back; and close to Juno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail, which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown pups\r\nwere rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On\r\na cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a maiden lady, who\r\nlooked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses, which she made as\r\nlittle show as possible of observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis \xc3\x86schylus, which Arthur knew\r\nwell by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing\r\nin, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a\r\nbachelor breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Arthur, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow! You\xe2\x80\x99re just in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nIrwine, as Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window-sill.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarroll, we shall want more coffee and eggs, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t you got some\r\ncold fowl for us to eat with that ham? Why, this is like old days,\r\nArthur; you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to breakfast with me these five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with\r\nyou. My grandfather is always a few degrees colder at breakfast than at\r\nany other hour in the day. I think his morning bath doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose.\r\nHe had no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s presence than the\r\nconfidence which he had thought quite easy before, suddenly appeared\r\nthe most difficult thing in the world to him, and at the very moment of\r\nshaking hands he saw his purpose in quite a new light. How could he\r\nmake Irwine understand his position unless he told him those little\r\nscenes in the wood; and how could he tell them without looking like a\r\nfool? And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s, and doing\r\nthe very opposite of what he intended! Irwine would think him a\r\nshilly-shally fellow ever after. However, it must come out in an\r\nunpremeditated way; the conversation might lead up to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like breakfast-time better than any other moment in the day,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cNo dust has settled on one\xe2\x80\x99s mind then, and it presents a\r\nclear mirror to the rays of things. I always have a favourite book by\r\nme at breakfast, and I enjoy the bits I pick up then so much, that\r\nregularly every morning it seems to me as if I should certainly become\r\nstudious again. But presently Dent brings up a poor fellow who has\r\nkilled a hare, and when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got through my \xe2\x80\x98justicing,\xe2\x80\x99 as Carroll\r\ncalls it, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined for a ride round the glebe, and on my way back I\r\nmeet with the master of the workhouse, who has got a long story of a\r\nmutinous pauper to tell me; and so the day goes on, and I\xe2\x80\x99m always the\r\nsame lazy fellow before evening sets in. Besides, one wants the\r\nstimulus of sympathy, and I have never had that since poor D\xe2\x80\x99Oyley left\r\nTreddleston. If you had stuck to your books well, you rascal, I should\r\nhave had a pleasanter prospect before me. But scholarship doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run\r\nin your family blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s well if I can remember a little inapplicable Latin to\r\nadorn my maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years hence. \xe2\x80\x98Cras\r\ningens iterabimus aequor,\xe2\x80\x99 and a few shreds of that sort, will perhaps\r\nstick to me, and I shall arrange my opinions so as to introduce them.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a knowledge of the classics is a pressing want to a\r\ncountry gentleman; as far as I can see, he\xe2\x80\x99d much better have a\r\nknowledge of manures. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading your friend Arthur Young\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks lately, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I should like better than to carry\r\nout some of his ideas in putting the farmers on a better management of\r\ntheir land; and, as he says, making what was a wild country, all of the\r\nsame dark hue, bright and variegated with corn and cattle. My\r\ngrandfather will never let me have any power while he lives, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I should like better than to undertake the Stonyshire\r\nside of the estate\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s in a dismal condition\xe2\x80\x94and set improvements on\r\nfoot, and gallop about from one place to another and overlook them. I\r\nshould like to know all the labourers, and see them touching their hats\r\nto me with a look of goodwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, Arthur! A man who has no feeling for the classics couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\na better apology for coming into the world than by increasing the\r\nquantity of food to maintain scholars\xe2\x80\x94and rectors who appreciate\r\nscholars. And whenever you enter on your career of model landlord may I\r\nbe there to see. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want a portly rector to complete the picture,\r\nand take his tithe of all the respect and honour you get by your hard\r\nwork. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t set your heart too strongly on the goodwill you are to\r\nget in consequence. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that men are the fondest of those who\r\ntry to be useful to them. You know Gawaine has got the curses of the\r\nwhole neighbourhood upon him about that enclosure. You must make it\r\nquite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon, old\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94popularity or usefulness\xe2\x80\x94else you may happen to miss both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Gawaine is harsh in his manners; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make himself\r\npersonally agreeable to his tenants. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s anything\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t prevail on people to do with kindness. For my part, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected and beloved.\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very pleasant to go among the tenants here\xe2\x80\x94they seem all so\r\nwell inclined to me I suppose it seems only the other day to them since\r\nI was a little lad, riding on a pony about as big as a sheep. And if\r\nfair allowances were made to them, and their buildings attended to, one\r\ncould persuade them to farm on a better plan, stupid as they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen mind you fall in love in the right place, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get a wife\r\nwho will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself.\r\nMy mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he\r\nfalls in love with.\xe2\x80\x99 She thinks your lady-love will rule you as the\r\nmoon rules the tides. But I feel bound to stand up for you, as my pupil\r\nyou know, and I maintain that you\xe2\x80\x99re not of that watery quality. So\r\nmind you don\xe2\x80\x99t disgrace my judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\r\nabout him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen. This, to be\r\nsure, was only another reason for persevering in his intention, and\r\ngetting an additional security against himself. Nevertheless, at this\r\npoint in the conversation, he was conscious of increased disinclination\r\nto tell his story about Hetty. He was of an impressible nature, and\r\nlived a great deal in other people\xe2\x80\x99s opinions and feelings concerning\r\nhimself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate\r\nfriend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such\r\nserious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own\r\nbelief in the seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a\r\nthing to make a fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him that he\r\ncould not do for himself? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlameness\xe2\x80\x94go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he could on the\r\nold hack. That was his thought as he sugared his coffee; but the next\r\nminute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he remembered how\r\nthoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine. No! He\r\nwould not be vacillating again\xe2\x80\x94he _would_ do what he had meant to do,\r\nthis time. So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the\r\nconversation altogether drop. If they went to quite indifferent topics,\r\nhis difficulty would be heightened. It had required no noticeable pause\r\nfor this rush and rebound of feeling, before he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think\r\nit is hardly an argument against a man\xe2\x80\x99s general strength of character\r\nthat he should be apt to be mastered by love. A fine constitution\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t insure one against smallpox or any other of those inevitable\r\ndiseases. A man may be very firm in other matters and yet be under a\r\nsort of witchery from a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but there\xe2\x80\x99s this difference between love and smallpox, or\r\nbewitchment either\xe2\x80\x94that if you detect the disease at an early stage and\r\ntry change of air, there is every chance of complete escape without any\r\nfurther development of symptoms. And there are certain alternative\r\ndoses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant\r\nconsequences before his mind: this gives you a sort of smoked glass\r\nthrough which you may look at the resplendent fair one and discern her\r\ntrue outline; though I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, by the by, the smoked glass is apt to\r\nbe missing just at the moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a\r\nman fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an\r\nimprudent marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in\r\nthe Prometheus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile that flitted across Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s face was a faint one, and\r\ninstead of following Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s playful lead, he said, quite\r\nseriously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a desperately vexatious\r\nthing, that after all one\xe2\x80\x99s reflections and quiet determinations, we\r\nshould be ruled by moods that one can\xe2\x80\x99t calculate on beforehand. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think a man ought to be blamed so much if he is betrayed into\r\ndoing things in that way, in spite of his resolutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but the moods lie in his nature, my boy, just as much as his\r\nreflections did, and more. A man can never do anything at variance with\r\nhis own nature. He carries within him the germ of his most exceptional\r\naction; and if we wise people make eminent fools of ourselves on any\r\nparticular occasion, we must endure the legitimate conclusion that we\r\ncarry a few grains of folly to our ounce of wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but one may be betrayed into doing things by a combination of\r\ncircumstances, which one might never have done otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, a man can\xe2\x80\x99t very well steal a bank-note unless the bank-note\r\nlies within convenient reach; but he won\xe2\x80\x99t make us think him an honest\r\nman because he begins to howl at the bank-note for falling in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t think a man who struggles against a temptation\r\ninto which he falls at last as bad as the man who never struggles at\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly; I pity him in proportion to his struggles, for they\r\nforeshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis.\r\nConsequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their terrible\r\nconsequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves. And it\r\nis best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of considering what\r\nmay be the elements of excuse for us. But I never knew you so inclined\r\nfor moral discussion, Arthur? Is it some danger of your own that you\r\nare considering in this philosophical, general way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away, threw\r\nhimself back in his chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He really\r\nsuspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something, and thought of\r\nsmoothing the way for him by this direct question. But he was mistaken.\r\nBrought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink of confession, Arthur\r\nshrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever. The\r\nconversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intended\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould quite mislead Irwine\xe2\x80\x94he would imagine there was a deep passion\r\nfor Hetty, while there was no such thing. He was conscious of\r\ncolouring, and was annoyed at his boyishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no danger,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as indifferently as he could. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat I am more liable to irresolution than other people; only there are\r\nlittle incidents now and then that set one speculating on what might\r\nhappen in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhich had a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to himself? Our\r\nmental business is carried on much in the same way as the business of\r\nthe State: a great deal of hard work is done by agents who are not\r\nacknowledged. In a piece of machinery, too, I believe there is often a\r\nsmall unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion\r\nof the large obvious ones. Possibly there was some such unrecognized\r\nagent secretly busy in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s mind at this moment\xe2\x80\x94possibly it was the\r\nfear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession\r\nto the rector a serious annoyance, in case he should _not_ be able\r\nquite to carry out his good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was\r\nnot so. The human soul is a very complex thing.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s mind as he looked\r\ninquiringly at Arthur, but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed\r\nthe thought which had quickly followed\xe2\x80\x94that there could be nothing\r\nserious in that direction. There was no probability that Arthur ever\r\nsaw her except at church, and at her own home under the eye of Mrs.\r\nPoyser; and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no\r\nmore serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to\r\nrouse the little chit\xe2\x80\x99s vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic\r\ndrama of her life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far\r\naway: no, there could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter had not been a strong security against it. His honest,\r\npatronizing pride in the good-will and respect of everybody about him\r\nwas a safeguard even against foolish romance, still more against a\r\nlower kind of folly. If there had been anything special on Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind in the previous conversation, it was clear he was not inclined to\r\nenter into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a\r\nfriendly curiosity. He perceived a change of subject would be welcome,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Arthur, at your colonel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday f\xc3\xaate there\r\nwere some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of\r\nBritannia, and Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98generous youth,\xe2\x80\x99 the hero of the day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you should get\r\nup something of the same sort to astonish our weak minds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe opportunity was gone. While Arthur was hesitating, the rope to\r\nwhich he might have clung had drifted away\xe2\x80\x94he must trust now to his own\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes from that time, Mr. Irwine was called for on business,\r\nand Arthur, bidding him good-bye, mounted his horse again with a sense\r\nof dissatisfaction, which he tried to quell by determining to set off\r\nfor Eagledale without an hour\xe2\x80\x99s delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\nIn Which the Story Pauses a Little\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan!\xe2\x80\x9d I hear one of\r\nmy readers exclaim. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much more edifying it would have been if you\r\nhad made him give Arthur some truly spiritual advice! You might have\r\nput into his mouth the most beautiful things\xe2\x80\x94quite as good as reading a\r\nsermon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly I could, if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to\r\nrepresent things as they never have been and never will be. Then, of\r\ncourse, I might refashion life and character entirely after my own\r\nliking; I might select the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and\r\nput my own admirable opinions into his mouth on all occasions. But it\r\nhappens, on the contrary, that my strongest effort is to avoid any such\r\narbitrary picture, and to give a faithful account of men and things as\r\nthey have mirrored themselves in my mind. The mirror is doubtless\r\ndefective, the outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the reflection\r\nfaint or confused; but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely as\r\nI can what that reflection is, as if I were in the witness-box,\r\nnarrating my experience on oath.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago\xe2\x80\x94it is a long time, so no wonder things have changed\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nclergymen were not zealous; indeed, there is reason to believe that the\r\nnumber of zealous clergymen was small, and it is probable that if one\r\namong the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope\r\nin the year 1799, you would have liked him no better than you like Mr.\r\nIrwine. Ten to one, you would have thought him a tasteless, indiscreet,\r\nmethodistical man. It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium\r\nrequired by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps you\r\nwill say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo improve the facts a little, then; make them more\r\naccordant with those correct views which it is our privilege to\r\npossess. The world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a\r\ntasteful pencil, and make believe it is not quite such a mixed\r\nentangled affair. Let all people who hold unexceptionable opinions act\r\nunexceptionably. Let your most faulty characters always be on the wrong\r\nside, and your virtuous ones on the right. Then we shall see at a\r\nglance whom we are to condemn and whom we are to approve. Then we shall\r\nbe able to admire, without the slightest disturbance of our\r\nprepossessions: we shall hate and despise with that true ruminant\r\nrelish which belongs to undoubting confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, my good friend, what will you do then with your fellow-parishioner\r\nwho opposes your husband in the vestry? With your newly appointed\r\nvicar, whose style of preaching you find painfully below that of his\r\nregretted predecessor? With the honest servant who worries your soul\r\nwith her one failing? With your neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was really\r\nkind to you in your last illness, but has said several ill-natured\r\nthings about you since your convalescence? Nay, with your excellent\r\nhusband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that of not\r\nwiping his shoes? These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as\r\nthey are: you can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their\r\nwit, nor rectify their dispositions; and it is these people\xe2\x80\x94amongst\r\nwhom your life is passed\xe2\x80\x94that it is needful you should tolerate, pity,\r\nand love: it is these more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people\r\nwhose movements of goodness you should be able to admire\xe2\x80\x94for whom you\r\nshould cherish all possible hopes, all possible patience. And I would\r\nnot, even if I had the choice, be the clever novelist who could create\r\na world so much better than this, in which we get up in the morning to\r\ndo our daily work, that you would be likely to turn a harder, colder\r\neye on the dusty streets and the common green fields\xe2\x80\x94on the real\r\nbreathing men and women, who can be chilled by your indifference or\r\ninjured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your\r\nfellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice.\r\n\r\nSo I am content to tell my simple story, without trying to make things\r\nseem better than they were; dreading nothing, indeed, but falsity,\r\nwhich, in spite of one\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts, there is reason to dread.\r\nFalsehood is so easy, truth so difficult. The pencil is conscious of a\r\ndelightful facility in drawing a griffin\xe2\x80\x94the longer the claws, and the\r\nlarger the wings, the better; but that marvellous facility which we\r\nmistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real\r\nunexaggerated lion. Examine your words well, and you will find that\r\neven when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to\r\nsay the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelings\xe2\x80\x94much harder\r\nthan to say something fine about them which is _not_ the exact truth.\r\n\r\nIt is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in\r\nmany Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I find a\r\nsource of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous\r\nhomely existence, which has been the fate of so many more among my\r\nfellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic\r\nsuffering or of world-stirring actions. I turn, without shrinking, from\r\ncloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls, and heroic warriors, to an\r\nold woman bending over her flower-pot, or eating her solitary dinner,\r\nwhile the noonday light, softened perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls\r\non her mob-cap, and just touches the rim of her spinning-wheel, and her\r\nstone jug, and all those cheap common things which are the precious\r\nnecessaries of life to her\xe2\x80\x94or I turn to that village wedding, kept\r\nbetween four brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance\r\nwith a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and\r\nmiddle-aged friends look on, with very irregular noses and lips, and\r\nprobably with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of\r\nunmistakable contentment and goodwill. \xe2\x80\x9cFoh!\xe2\x80\x9d says my idealistic\r\nfriend, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat vulgar details! What good is there in taking all these\r\npains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a low\r\nphase of life! What clumsy, ugly people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I\r\nhope? I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not\r\nbeen ugly, and even among those \xe2\x80\x9clords of their kind,\xe2\x80\x9d the British,\r\nsquat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and dingy complexions are not\r\nstartling exceptions. Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst\r\nus. I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the\r\nApollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; yet\r\nto my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their\r\nminiatures\xe2\x80\x94flattering, but still not lovely\xe2\x80\x94are kissed in secret by\r\nmotherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have\r\nnever in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of\r\nyellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered\r\nkisses on her sallow cheeks. And I believe there have been plenty of\r\nyoung heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite\r\nsure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana,\r\nand yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a\r\nwife who waddles. Yes! Thank God; human feeling is like the mighty\r\nrivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for beauty\xe2\x80\x94it flows with\r\nresistless force and brings beauty with it.\r\n\r\nAll honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate\r\nit to the utmost in men, women, and children\xe2\x80\x94in our gardens and in our\r\nhouses. But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret\r\nof proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an\r\nangel, if you can, with a floating violet robe, and a face paled by the\r\ncelestial light; paint us yet oftener a Madonna, turning her mild face\r\nupward and opening her arms to welcome the divine glory; but do not\r\nimpose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of\r\nArt those old women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those\r\nheavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those rounded backs\r\nand stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade and done\r\nthe rough work of the world\xe2\x80\x94those homes with their tin pans, their\r\nbrown pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this\r\nworld there are so many of these common coarse people, who have no\r\npicturesque sentimental wretchedness! It is so needful we should\r\nremember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of\r\nour religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a\r\nworld of extremes. Therefore, let Art always remind us of them;\r\ntherefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a\r\nlife to the faithful representing of commonplace things\xe2\x80\x94men who see\r\nbeauty in these commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly\r\nthe light of heaven falls on them. There are few prophets in the world;\r\nfew sublimely beautiful women; few heroes. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to give all\r\nmy love and reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those\r\nfeelings for my every-day fellow-men, especially for the few in the\r\nforeground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose hands I\r\ntouch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy. Neither are\r\npicturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your\r\ncommon labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but\r\ncreditably with his own pocket-knife. It is more needful that I should\r\nhave a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who\r\nweighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat, than\r\nwith the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers\xe2\x80\x94more needful\r\nthat my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of\r\ngentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with\r\nme, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who is perhaps rather too\r\ncorpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than\r\nat the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at\r\nthe sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived\r\nby an able novelist.\r\n\r\nAnd so I come back to Mr. Irwine, with whom I desire you to be in\r\nperfect charity, far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the\r\nclerical character. Perhaps you think he was not\xe2\x80\x94as he ought to have\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94a living demonstration of the benefits attached to a national\r\nchurch? But I am not sure of that; at least I know that the people in\r\nBroxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their\r\nclergyman, and that most faces brightened at his approach; and until it\r\ncan be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love, I\r\nmust believe that Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s influence in his parish was a more\r\nwholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty\r\nyears afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers. It\r\nis true, Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the\r\nReformation, visited his flock a great deal in their own homes, and was\r\nsevere in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh\xe2\x80\x94put a stop, indeed, to\r\nthe Christmas rounds of the church singers, as promoting drunkenness\r\nand too light a handling of sacred things. But I gathered from Adam\r\nBede, to whom I talked of these matters in his old age, that few\r\nclergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of their\r\nparishioners than Mr. Ryde. They learned a great many notions about\r\ndoctrine from him, so that almost every church-goer under fifty began\r\nto distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come\r\nprecisely up to that standard, as if he had been born and bred a\r\nDissenter; and for some time after his arrival there seemed to be quite\r\na religious movement in that quiet rural district. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething else besides notions. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t notions sets people doing the\r\nright thing\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with the notions in religion\r\nas it is with math\xe2\x80\x99matics\xe2\x80\x94a man may be able to work problems straight\r\noff in\xe2\x80\x99s head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe, but if he has\r\nto make a machine or a building, he must have a will and a resolution\r\nand love something else better than his own ease. Somehow, the\r\ncongregation began to fall off, and people began to speak light o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr.\r\nRyde. I believe he meant right at bottom; but, you see, he was\r\nsourish-tempered, and was for beating down prices with the people as\r\nworked for him; and his preaching wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go down well with that\r\nsauce. And he wanted to be like my lord judge i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish, punishing\r\nfolks for doing wrong; and he scolded \xe2\x80\x99em from the pulpit as if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen a Ranter, and yet he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide the Dissenters, and was a deal\r\nmore set against \xe2\x80\x99em than Mr. Irwine was. And then he didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nwithin his income, for he seemed to think at first go-off that six\r\nhundred a-year was to make him as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na sore mischief I\xe2\x80\x99ve often seen with the poor curates jumping into a\r\nbit of a living all of a sudden. Mr. Ryde was a deal thought on at a\r\ndistance, I believe, and he wrote books, but as for math\xe2\x80\x99matics and the\r\nnatur o\xe2\x80\x99 things, he was as ignorant as a woman. He was very knowing\r\nabout doctrines, and used to call \xe2\x80\x99em the bulwarks of the Reformation;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve always mistrusted that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 learning as leaves folks\r\nfoolish and unreasonable about business. Now Mester Irwine was as\r\ndifferent as could be: as quick!\xe2\x80\x94he understood what you meant in a\r\nminute, and he knew all about building, and could see when you\xe2\x80\x99d made a\r\ngood job. And he behaved as much like a gentleman to the farmers, and\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 old women, and the labourers, as he did to the gentry. You never\r\nsaw _him_ interfering and scolding, and trying to play th\xe2\x80\x99 emperor. Ah,\r\nhe was a fine man as ever you set eyes on; and so kind to\xe2\x80\x99s mother and\r\nsisters. That poor sickly Miss Anne\xe2\x80\x94he seemed to think more of her than\r\nof anybody else in the world. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul in the parish had a\r\nword to say against him; and his servants stayed with him till they\r\nwere so old and pottering, he had to hire other folks to do their\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was an excellent way of preaching in the\r\nweekdays; but I daresay, if your old friend Mr. Irwine were to come to\r\nlife again, and get into the pulpit next Sunday, you would be rather\r\nashamed that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t preach better after all your praise of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, broadening his chest and throwing himself back\r\nin his chair, as if he were ready to meet all inferences, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody has\r\never heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into\r\ndeep speritial experience; and I know there s a deal in a man\xe2\x80\x99s inward\r\nlife as you can\xe2\x80\x99t measure by the square, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Do this and that \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfollow,\xe2\x80\x99 and, \xe2\x80\x98Do that and this \xe2\x80\x99ll follow.\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s things go on in\r\nthe soul, and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty\r\nwind, as the Scripture says, and part your life in two a\xe2\x80\x99most, so you\r\nlook back on yourself as if you was somebody else. Those are things as\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t bottle up in a \xe2\x80\x98do this\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98do that\xe2\x80\x99; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go so far\r\nwith the strongest Methodist ever you\xe2\x80\x99ll find. That shows me there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeep speritial things in religion. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make much out wi\xe2\x80\x99 talking\r\nabout it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into those things\xe2\x80\x94he\r\npreached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted\r\npretty much up to what he said; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t set up for being so different\r\nfrom other folks one day, and then be as like \xe2\x80\x99em as two peas the next.\r\nAnd he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor\r\nstirring up their gall wi\xe2\x80\x99 being overbusy. Mrs. Poyser used to say\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow she would have her word about everything\xe2\x80\x94she said, Mr. Irwine was\r\nlike a good meal o\xe2\x80\x99 victual, you were the better for him without\r\nthinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o\xe2\x80\x99 physic, he gripped you\r\nand worreted you, and after all he left you much the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Ryde preach a great deal more about that spiritual part\r\nof religion that you talk of, Adam? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you get more out of his\r\nsermons than out of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, I knowna. He preached a deal about doctrines. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pretty\r\nclear, ever since I was a young un, as religion\xe2\x80\x99s something else\r\nbesides doctrines and notions. I look at it as if the doctrines was\r\nlike finding names for your feelings, so as you can talk of \xe2\x80\x99em when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never known \xe2\x80\x99em, just as a man may talk o\xe2\x80\x99 tools when he knows\r\ntheir names, though he\xe2\x80\x99s never so much as seen \xe2\x80\x99em, still less handled\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine i\xe2\x80\x99 my time, for I used to go after\r\nthe Dissenting preachers along wi\xe2\x80\x99 Seth, when I was a lad o\xe2\x80\x99 seventeen,\r\nand got puzzling myself a deal about th\xe2\x80\x99 Arminians and the Calvinists.\r\nThe Wesleyans, you know, are strong Arminians; and Seth, who could\r\nnever abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best, held\r\nfast by the Wesleyans from the very first; but I thought I could pick a\r\nhole or two in their notions, and I got disputing wi\xe2\x80\x99 one o\xe2\x80\x99 the class\r\nleaders down at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on, and harassed him so, first o\xe2\x80\x99 this side\r\nand then o\xe2\x80\x99 that, till at last he said, \xe2\x80\x98Young man, it\xe2\x80\x99s the devil\r\nmaking use o\xe2\x80\x99 your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the\r\nsimplicity o\xe2\x80\x99 the truth.\xe2\x80\x99 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help laughing then, but as I was\r\ngoing home, I thought the man wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far wrong. I began to see as all\r\nthis weighing and sifting what this text means and that text means, and\r\nwhether folks are saved all by God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, or whether there goes an\r\nounce o\xe2\x80\x99 their own will to\xe2\x80\x99t, was no part o\xe2\x80\x99 real religion at all. You\r\nmay talk o\xe2\x80\x99 these things for hours on end, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll only be all the\r\nmore coxy and conceited for\xe2\x80\x99t. So I took to going nowhere but to\r\nchurch, and hearing nobody but Mr. Irwine, for he said nothing but what\r\nwas good and what you\xe2\x80\x99d be the wiser for remembering. And I found it\r\nbetter for my soul to be humble before the mysteries o\xe2\x80\x99 God\xe2\x80\x99s dealings,\r\nand not be making a clatter about what I could never understand. And\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re poor foolish questions after all; for what have we got either\r\ninside or outside of us but what comes from God? If we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nresolution to do right, He gave it us, I reckon, first or last; but I\r\nsee plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, you perceive, was a warm admirer, perhaps a partial judge, of Mr.\r\nIrwine, as, happily, some of us still are of the people we have known\r\nfamiliarly. Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty\r\norder of minds who pant after the ideal, and are oppressed by a general\r\nsense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit\r\nobjects among their everyday fellowmen. I have often been favoured with\r\nthe confidence of these select natures, and find them to concur in the\r\nexperience that great men are overestimated and small men are\r\ninsupportable; that if you would love a woman without ever looking back\r\non your love as a folly, she must die while you are courting her; and\r\nif you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism, you must\r\nnever make a pilgrimage to see the hero. I confess I have often meanly\r\nshrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what\r\nmy own experience has been. I am afraid I have often smiled with\r\nhypocritical assent, and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting\r\nnature of our illusions, which any one moderately acquainted with\r\nFrench literature can command at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Human converse, I\r\nthink some wise man has remarked, is not rigidly sincere. But I\r\nherewith discharge my conscience, and declare that I have had quite\r\nenthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who spoke\r\nthe worst English, who were occasionally fretful in their temper, and\r\nwho had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish\r\noverseer; and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that\r\nhuman nature is lovable\xe2\x80\x94the way I have learnt something of its deep\r\npathos, its sublime mysteries\xe2\x80\x94has been by living a great deal among\r\npeople more or less commonplace and vulgar, of whom you would perhaps\r\nhear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about them in the\r\nneighbourhoods where they dwelt. Ten to one most of the small\r\nshopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them. For I have\r\nobserved this remarkable coincidence, that the select natures who pant\r\nafter the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great\r\nenough to command their reverence and love, are curiously in unison\r\nwith the narrowest and pettiest. For example, I have often heard Mr.\r\nGedge, the landlord of the Royal Oak, who used to turn a bloodshot eye\r\non his neighbours in the village of Shepperton, sum up his opinion of\r\nthe people in his own parish\xe2\x80\x94and they were all the people he knew\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthese emphatic words: \xe2\x80\x9cAye, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it often, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it\r\nagain, they\xe2\x80\x99re a poor lot i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish\xe2\x80\x94a poor lot, sir, big and\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a\r\ndistant parish, he might find neighbours worthy of him; and indeed he\r\ndid subsequently transfer himself to the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s Head, which was\r\ndoing a thriving business in the back street of a neighbouring\r\nmarket-town. But, oddly enough, he has found the people up that back\r\nstreet of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Shepperton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca\r\npoor lot, sir, big and little, and them as comes for a go o\xe2\x80\x99 gin are no\r\nbetter than them as comes for a pint o\xe2\x80\x99 twopenny\xe2\x80\x94a poor lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\nChurch\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty, Hetty, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know church begins at two, and it\xe2\x80\x99s gone half\r\nafter one a\xe2\x80\x99ready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good\r\nSunday as poor old Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x99s to be put into the ground, and him\r\ndrownded i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 dead o\xe2\x80\x99 the night, as it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make one\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\nrun cold, but you must be \xe2\x80\x99dizening yourself as if there was a wedding\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99stid of a funeral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be ready so soon as everybody else,\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Totty\xe2\x80\x99s things to put on. And I\xe2\x80\x99d ever such work to make\r\nher stand still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and\r\nshawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been\r\nmade of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her\r\nhat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a\r\nwhite ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in\r\nher dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was\r\nprovoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any\r\nmortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she\r\nturned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,\r\nfollowed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some\r\none she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she\r\ntrod on.\r\n\r\nAnd now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday\r\nsuit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon\r\nhaving a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from\r\nthat promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk\r\nhandkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed\r\nstockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s own hand, setting off the\r\nproportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his\r\nleg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other\r\nfashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a\r\npitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be\r\nashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Hetty\xe2\x80\x94come, little uns!\xe2\x80\x9d and giving his arm to his wife,\r\nled the way through the causeway gate into the yard.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9clittle uns\xe2\x80\x9d addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and\r\nseven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by\r\nrosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very\r\nsmall elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and\r\nbehind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the\r\nyard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having\r\nspeedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to\r\nchurch to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace\r\noutside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be\r\ncarried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the\r\nmorning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering\r\nsilvery masses on the horizon.\r\n\r\nYou might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the\r\nfarmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning\r\nsubdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would\r\nhave been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed\r\nto call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on\r\nthe moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together\r\nwith their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow\r\nstretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an\r\nexcellent spring-bed on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd,\r\nin his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting,\r\nhalf-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church,\r\nlike other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who\r\nhad the weather and the ewes on his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cChurch! Nay\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99n gotten\r\nsummat else to think on,\xe2\x80\x9d was an answer which he often uttered in a\r\ntone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure\r\nAlick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a\r\nspeculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed\r\ngoing to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and \xe2\x80\x9cWhissuntide.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nhe had a general impression that public worship and religious\r\nceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for\r\npeople who had leisure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Father a-standing at the yard-gate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nreckon he wants to watch us down the field. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful what sight\r\nhe has, and him turned seventy-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I often think it\xe2\x80\x99s wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 old folks as it is wi\xe2\x80\x99 the babbies,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied wi\xe2\x80\x99 looking, no matter what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re looking at. It\xe2\x80\x99s God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty\xe2\x80\x99s way o\xe2\x80\x99 quietening \xe2\x80\x99em, I\r\nreckon, afore they go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching,\r\nand held it wide open, leaning on his stick\xe2\x80\x94pleased to do this bit of\r\nwork; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he\r\nliked to feel that he was still useful\xe2\x80\x94that there was a better crop of\r\nonions in the garden because he was by at the sowing\xe2\x80\x94and that the cows\r\nwould be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon\r\nto look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very\r\nregularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of\r\nrheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll ha\xe2\x80\x99 putten Thias Bede i\xe2\x80\x99 the ground afore ye get to the\r\nchurchyard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as his son came up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been better luck\r\nif they\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 buried him i\xe2\x80\x99 the forenoon when the rain was fallin\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no likelihoods of a drop now; an\xe2\x80\x99 the moon lies like a boat\r\nthere, dost see? That\xe2\x80\x99s a sure sign o\xe2\x80\x99 fair weather\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a many as\r\nis false but that\xe2\x80\x99s sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the son, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in hopes it\xe2\x80\x99ll hold up now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGrandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of\r\na marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling,\r\na little, secretly, during the sermon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDood-bye, Dandad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Totty. \xe2\x80\x9cMe doin\xe2\x80\x99 to church. Me dot my neklace\r\non. Dive me a peppermint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrandad, shaking with laughter at this \xe2\x80\x9cdeep little wench,\xe2\x80\x9d slowly\r\ntransferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and\r\nslowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had\r\nfixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.\r\n\r\nAnd when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again,\r\nwatching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far\r\ngate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the\r\nhedgerows in those days shut out one\xe2\x80\x99s view, even on the better-managed\r\nfarms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink\r\nwreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale\r\nhoneysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and\r\nover all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow\r\nacross the path.\r\n\r\nThere were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let\r\nthem pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of\r\ncows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that\r\ntheir large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the\r\nmare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured\r\nfoal with its head towards its mother\xe2\x80\x99s flank, apparently still much\r\nembarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely\r\nthrough Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s own fields till they reached the main road leading\r\nto the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as\r\nthey went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running\r\ncommentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share\r\nin making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on\r\nstock and their \xe2\x80\x9ckeep\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an exercise which strengthens her understanding\r\nso much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s that shorthorned Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as they entered the Home\r\nClose, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud\r\nand looking at her with a sleepy eye. \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to hate the sight o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ncow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid\r\nof her the better, for there\xe2\x80\x99s that little yallow cow as doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nhalf the milk, and yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve twice as much butter from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee\xe2\x80\x99t not like the women in general,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nlike the shorthorns, as give such a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 milk. There\xe2\x80\x99s Chowne\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwants him to buy no other sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it sinnify what Chowne\xe2\x80\x99s wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi\xe2\x80\x99 no\r\nmore head-piece nor a sparrow. She\xe2\x80\x99d take a big cullender to strain her\r\nlard wi\xe2\x80\x99, and then wonder as the scratchin\xe2\x80\x99s run through. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nenough of her to know as I\xe2\x80\x99ll niver take a servant from her house\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94all hugger-mugger\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99d niver know, when you went in, whether\r\nit was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin\xe2\x80\x99 on to th\xe2\x80\x99 end o\xe2\x80\x99 the week;\r\nand as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin\r\nlast year. And then she talks o\xe2\x80\x99 the weather bein\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 fault, as there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfolks \xe2\x80\x99ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i\xe2\x80\x99 their\r\nboots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Chowne\xe2\x80\x99s been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if\r\nthee lik\xe2\x80\x99st,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s superior\r\npower of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he\r\nhad more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of\r\nshorthorns. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, them as choose a soft for a wife may\xe2\x80\x99s well buy up\r\nthe shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs\r\nmay\xe2\x80\x99s well go after it. Eh! Talk o\xe2\x80\x99 legs, there\xe2\x80\x99s legs for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPoyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry,\r\ntoddled on in front of her father and mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s shapes! An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s got such a long foot, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be her father\xe2\x80\x99s own child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be welly such a one as Hetty i\xe2\x80\x99 ten years\xe2\x80\x99 time, on\xe2\x80\x99y\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s got _thy_ coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nfamily; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child \xe2\x80\x99ull be none the worse for having summat as isn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nHetty. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 that, there\xe2\x80\x99s people wi\xe2\x80\x99 light hair an\xe2\x80\x99 blue eyes as pretty as them\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 black. If Dinah had got a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 colour in her cheeks, an\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows,\r\nfolks \xe2\x80\x99ud think her as pretty as Hetty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthee\r\ndostna know the pints of a woman. The men \xe2\x80\x99ud niver run after Dinah as\r\nthey would after Hetty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat care I what the men \xe2\x80\x99ud run after? It\xe2\x80\x99s well seen what choice the\r\nmost of \xe2\x80\x99em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o\xe2\x80\x99 wives you\r\nsee, like bits o\xe2\x80\x99 gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice\r\nwhen I married thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little\r\nconjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; \xe2\x80\x9cand thee wast twice as\r\nbuxom as Dinah ten year ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a\r\nhouse. There\xe2\x80\x99s Chowne\xe2\x80\x99s wife ugly enough to turn the milk an\xe2\x80\x99 save the\r\nrennet, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah,\r\npoor child, she\xe2\x80\x99s niver likely to be buxom as long as she\xe2\x80\x99ll make her\r\ndinner o\xe2\x80\x99 cake and water, for the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 giving to them as want. She\r\nprovoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99 the Scriptur\xe2\x80\x99, for that says, \xe2\x80\x98Love your neighbour as yourself\xe2\x80\x99;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do\r\nyourself, Dinah, it\xe2\x80\x99s little enough you\xe2\x80\x99d do for him. You\xe2\x80\x99d be thinking\r\nhe might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.\xe2\x80\x99 Eh, I wonder where\r\nshe is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d set her heart on going to all of a sudden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she\r\nmight ha\xe2\x80\x99 stayed wi\xe2\x80\x99 us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she\r\nwanted, and it \xe2\x80\x99ud niver ha\xe2\x80\x99 been missed. She made no odds in th\xe2\x80\x99 house\r\nat all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and\r\nwas uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets\r\nmarried, theed\xe2\x80\x99st like to ha\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee constant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well\r\nbeckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an\xe2\x80\x99 live here\r\ncomfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, _I_ should\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 turned her, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded\r\nher too; for she\xe2\x80\x99s my own sister\xe2\x80\x99s child, and it behoves me to do what\r\nI can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99d said us \xe2\x80\x98good-bye\xe2\x80\x99\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 got into the cart, an\xe2\x80\x99 looked back at me with her pale face, as is\r\nwelly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be\r\nfrightened to think o\xe2\x80\x99 the set-downs I\xe2\x80\x99d given her; for it comes over\r\nyou sometimes as if she\xe2\x80\x99d a way o\xe2\x80\x99 knowing the rights o\xe2\x80\x99 things more\r\nnor other folks have. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll niver give in as that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nMethodist, no more nor a white calf\xe2\x80\x99s white \xe2\x80\x99cause it eats out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsame bucket wi\xe2\x80\x99 a black un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his\r\ngood-nature would allow; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no opinion o\xe2\x80\x99 the Methodists. It\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y\r\ntradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nmaggots. There\xe2\x80\x99s maybe a workman now an\xe2\x80\x99 then, as isn\xe2\x80\x99t overclever at\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, takes to preachin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as\r\nhas got one o\xe2\x80\x99 the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood Churchman, else I\xe2\x80\x99d never encourage him for a sweetheart for\r\nHetty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, goodness me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her\r\nhusband was speaking, \xe2\x80\x9clook where Molly is with them lads! They\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nfield\xe2\x80\x99s length behind us. How _could_ you let \xe2\x80\x99em do so, Hetty? Anybody\r\nmight as well set a pictur\xe2\x80\x99 to watch the children as you. Run back and\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99em to come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they\r\nset Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true\r\nLoamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers; Totty observing with\r\ncomplacency, \xe2\x80\x9cDey naughty, naughty boys\xe2\x80\x94me dood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with\r\ngreat excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on\r\nin the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping\r\nthan if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite\r\nsure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while\r\nhe was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which\r\nhad run across the path and was described with much fervour by the\r\njunior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged,\r\nfluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it,\r\ntill it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not\r\nbe got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her\r\nready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cLawks!\xe2\x80\x9d whenever she was expected to wonder.\r\n\r\nMolly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called\r\nto them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found the speckled turkey\xe2\x80\x99s nest, Mother!\xe2\x80\x9d with the instinctive\r\nconfidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this\r\npleasant surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a good lad; why, where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking\r\nafter the greenfinch, and she sat on th\xe2\x80\x99 nest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t frighten her, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, \xe2\x80\x9celse she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nforsake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t I,\r\nMolly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, now come on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cand walk before Father\r\nand Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go\r\nstraight on now. Good boys don\xe2\x80\x99t look after the birds of a Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said you\xe2\x80\x99d give half-a-crown to find\r\nthe speckled turkey\xe2\x80\x99s nest. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I have the half-crown put into my\r\nmoney-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at\r\ntheir eldest-born\xe2\x80\x99s acuteness; but on Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s round face there was a\r\ncloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, half-crying, \xe2\x80\x9cMarty\xe2\x80\x99s got ever so much more money in\r\nhis box nor I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMunny, _me_ want half-a-toun in _my_ bots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Totty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cdid ever anybody hear such\r\nnaughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t make haste and go on to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two\r\nremaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any\r\nserious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,\r\nalias \xe2\x80\x9cbullheads,\xe2\x80\x9d which the lads looked at wistfully.\r\n\r\nThe damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not\r\na cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had\r\noften some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no\r\ntemptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however\r\nearly in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a\r\npair of oxen \xe2\x80\x9csweltered\xe2\x80\x9d while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That\r\nwas a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and\r\nwith wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would\r\nhave nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt a\xe2\x80\x99most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, as they passed through the \xe2\x80\x9cBig Meadow.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoor foolishness to think o\xe2\x80\x99 saving by going against your conscience.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call \xe2\x80\x98Gentleman Wakefield,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nused to do the same of a Sunday as o\xe2\x80\x99 weekdays, and took no heed to\r\nright or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s he\r\ncome to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\noranges in\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cyou make but a poor\r\ntrap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi\xe2\x80\x99 wickedness. The money as\r\nis got so\xe2\x80\x99s like to burn holes i\xe2\x80\x99 your pocket. I\xe2\x80\x99d niver wish us to\r\nleave our lads a sixpence but what was got i\xe2\x80\x99 the rightful way. And as\r\nfor the weather, there\xe2\x80\x99s One above makes it, and we must put up wi\xe2\x80\x99t:\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit\r\nwhich Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s clock had of taking time by the forelock had\r\nsecured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to\r\ntwo, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already\r\nwithin the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly\r\nmothers, like Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her\r\nbaby and feeling as women feel in that position\xe2\x80\x94that nothing else can\r\nbe expected of them.\r\n\r\nIt was not entirely to see Thias Bede\xe2\x80\x99s funeral that the people were\r\nstanding about the churchyard so long before service began; that was\r\ntheir common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at\r\nonce, and the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives talked in an undertone to each other, over\r\nthe tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as\r\nfar preferable\xe2\x80\x94about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to\r\nwages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to\r\nyear, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you\r\ncould see her\xe2\x80\x94about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer,\r\nwas giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as\r\nto his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible\r\nwoman, and they were all sorry for _her_, for she had very good kin.\r\nMeantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the\r\nsingers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through,\r\nentered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason\r\nfor that premature entrance\xe2\x80\x94what could they do in church if they were\r\nthere before service began?\xe2\x80\x94and they did not conceive that any power in\r\nthe universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a\r\nlittle about \xe2\x80\x9cbus\xe2\x80\x99ness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got\r\nhis clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry\r\nat him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at\r\nonce as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with\r\nwhich the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the\r\nfarmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a\r\ncandle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on\r\nweekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was,\r\nafter all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had\r\nhorses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher\r\nsort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where\r\nthe burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the\r\nfarm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off,\r\nas fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway\r\nposition, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes\r\nlistening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near\r\nthe church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family\r\npassed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson,\r\nthe landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking\r\nattitude\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust\r\nbetween the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches\r\npocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like\r\nan actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels\r\nsure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business;\r\ncuriously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands\r\nbehind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward\r\nscorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk\r\nwas in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the\r\nsound of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s voice reading the final prayers of the\r\nburial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but\r\nnow they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances\r\nagainst Satchell, the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s bailiff, who played the part of steward\r\nso far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that\r\ngentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains\r\nabout his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional\r\nreason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be\r\nwalking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became\r\nsuddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s voice had ceased, and the group round\r\nthe white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.\r\n\r\nThey all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine\r\npassed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them;\r\nfor Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not\r\nyet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause\r\nbefore the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look\r\nagain towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth\r\nunder the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any\r\nday since her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death. Along with all her grief there was mixed\r\nan unusual sense of her own importance in having a \xe2\x80\x9cburial,\xe2\x80\x9d and in Mr.\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x99s reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she\r\nknew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this\r\ncounter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with\r\nher sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods\r\nof their fellow-parishioners.\r\n\r\nThe mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the\r\nloiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of\r\nMr. Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill,\r\nperhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.\r\n\r\nBut presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;\r\nthe evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every\r\none must now enter and take his place.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for\r\nanything except for the grey age of its oaken pews\xe2\x80\x94great square pews\r\nmostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed,\r\nfrom the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to\r\nthemselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short\r\nprocess for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,\r\nand return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,\r\ngrey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into\r\nthe chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the\r\nbuff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,\r\nand agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.\r\nAnd there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the\r\npulpit and Mr. Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s own pew had handsome crimson cloth\r\ncushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth,\r\nembroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s own hand.\r\n\r\nBut even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and\r\ncheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on\r\nthat simple congregation\xe2\x80\x94on the hardy old men, with bent knees and\r\nshoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and\r\nthatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of\r\nthe stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers,\r\nwith their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly\r\nfarm-labourers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under\r\ntheir black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow,\r\nfolded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood words\xe2\x80\x9d by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved\r\nsilently, following the service without any very clear comprehension\r\nindeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and\r\nbring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey\r\npews, while good Bishop Ken\xe2\x80\x99s evening hymn was being sung to one of\r\nthose lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of\r\nrectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of\r\nPan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in\r\nhis usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother\r\nand Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass\r\nnotes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into\r\nthe glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.\r\n\r\nI beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his\r\nample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair\r\nthrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and\r\nupper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen\r\ncountenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul\r\nbeams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through\r\nthe old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue,\r\nthat threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nI think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant\r\nlonger than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his\r\nfamily. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it\r\nimpossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white\r\nfigure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be\r\ncoming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate\r\nby this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the\r\nwood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things\r\nhad gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that\r\nhad happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already\r\nlike a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat\r\nso, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she\r\ncurtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x94he always came\r\nfirst, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted\r\nglances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss\r\nLydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her\r\nfashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses\r\nround it, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it to-day. But there were no more\r\ncurtsies\xe2\x80\x94no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else\r\npassing the pew door but the house-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s black bonnet and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s, and then\r\nthe powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet\r\nshe would look now\xe2\x80\x94she might be mistaken\xe2\x80\x94for, after all, she had not\r\nlooked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the\r\ncushioned pew in the chancel\xe2\x80\x94there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne\r\nrubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia\r\nopening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was\r\ntoo hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling;\r\nshe was ready to cry. Oh, what _should_ she do? Everybody would know\r\nthe reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not\r\nthere. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his\r\nbutton-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long\r\nbefore the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two\r\ngreat drops _would_ fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured\r\nMolly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her.\r\nMolly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except\r\nfaintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of\r\nher pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much\r\nlabour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnostrils. \xe2\x80\x9cIt donna smell,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, thinking this was a great\r\nadvantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good\r\nwithout biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this\r\nlittle flash of temper did what the salts could not have done\xe2\x80\x94it roused\r\nher to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might\r\nnot to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little\r\nnature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or\r\npointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have\r\npressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should\r\nknow a secret she did not want them to know.\r\n\r\nWhat fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while\r\nMr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolution\xe2\x80\x9d in her deaf ears,\r\nand through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very\r\nclose to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures\r\nher small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s absence on the\r\nsupposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her\r\nagain. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because\r\nall the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even\r\nwith a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches\r\nto herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain\xe2\x80\x94she would\r\nlike him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in\r\nher soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids\r\nwith their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,\r\nas he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.\r\n\r\nBut Adam\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they\r\nrather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church\r\nservice was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness\r\nof our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our\r\nmoments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the\r\nbest channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and\r\nresignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with\r\noutbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar\r\nrhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of\r\nworship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had\r\nworshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light\r\nand shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the\r\nheathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never\r\nlies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past:\r\nno wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as\r\nwell put on his spectacles to discern odours.\r\n\r\nBut there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the\r\nservice in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village\r\nnooks in the kingdom\xe2\x80\x94a reason of which I am sure you have not the\r\nslightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann.\r\nWhere that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a\r\nmystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all,\r\nhe got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into\r\nthis honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other\r\nnarrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice\r\nand a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had\r\nsufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the\r\nresponses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy\r\ncadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint\r\nresonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can\r\ncompare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and\r\ncadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange\r\nmode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk\xe2\x80\x94a man in rusty\r\nspectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown.\r\nBut that is Nature\xe2\x80\x99s way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid\r\nphysiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and\r\nnot give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some\r\nnarrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house,\r\nshall be as true to his intervals as a bird.\r\n\r\nJoshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and\r\nit was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from\r\nthe desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion,\r\nfor an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death\xe2\x80\x94not in\r\nhis bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnow the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.\r\nMoreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s importance in\r\nthe choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.\r\nThe old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sweep\xe2\x80\x99st us off as with a flood;\r\nWe vanish hence like dreams\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nseemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor\r\nThias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.\r\nLisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good;\r\nit was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a\r\ngreater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy\r\ndays while he was living. The more there was said about her husband,\r\nthe more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was\r\npoor Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a\r\nground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed\r\ntears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single\r\nmoment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and\r\nreconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were\r\nsinging that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by\r\ntime? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had\r\nknown plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this\r\nwas the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough\r\nit was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation\r\nwas for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hand before their parting, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, you know it was\r\nall right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad;\r\nyou forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam\r\nthought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had\r\nspent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his\r\nhead before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in\r\nsubmissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as\r\nto our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of\r\nour anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face\r\nfor the last time in the meekness of death!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I was always too hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sore fault\r\nin me as I\xe2\x80\x99m so hot and out o\xe2\x80\x99 patience with people when they do wrong,\r\nand my heart gets shut up against \xe2\x80\x99em, so as I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to\r\nforgive \xe2\x80\x99em. I see clear enough there\xe2\x80\x99s more pride nor love in my soul,\r\nfor I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th\xe2\x80\x99 hammer for my\r\nfather than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went\r\nplenty o\xe2\x80\x99 pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil _will_ be\r\nhaving his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins.\r\nMayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was\r\neasiest for myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s allays been easier for me to work nor to sit\r\nstill, but the real tough job for me \xe2\x80\x99ud be to master my own will and\r\ntemper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was\r\nto find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno knowing\xe2\x80\x94perhaps nothing \xe2\x80\x99ud be a lesson to us if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come too\r\nlate. It\xe2\x80\x99s well we should feel as life\xe2\x80\x99s a reckoning we can\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\ntwice over; there\xe2\x80\x99s no real making amends in this world, any more nor\r\nyou can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the key-note to which Adam\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had perpetually returned\r\nsince his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was\r\nonly an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger\r\nemphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference\r\nto Thias\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nmidst of life we are in death\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94how the present moment is all we can\r\ncall our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family\r\ntenderness. All very old truths\xe2\x80\x94but what we thought the oldest truth\r\nbecomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the\r\ndead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men\r\nwant to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid\r\nlight, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we\r\nmay measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?\r\n\r\nThen came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to\r\nblend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of\r\nthe congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the\r\nbonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the\r\nfathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the\r\nold archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk,\r\ntheir simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday\r\nevery one was ready to receive a guest\xe2\x80\x94it was the day when all must be\r\nin their best clothes and their best humour.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were\r\nwaiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without\r\nsaying a kind word to the widow and her sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Bede,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve lived to rear their children and see one another\xe2\x80\x99s hair grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cthey wonna have long to wait for one\r\nanother then, anyhow. And ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got two o\xe2\x80\x99 the strapping\xe2\x80\x99st sons i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncountry; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re straighter i\xe2\x80\x99 the back nor half the young women now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s poor luck for the platter to wear well when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s broke i\xe2\x80\x99 two. The sooner I\xe2\x80\x99m laid under the thorn the better. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nno good to nobody now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam never took notice of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s little unjust plaints; but Seth\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons \xe2\x80\x99ull never get another\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, lad, that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong on us\r\nto give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it\xe2\x80\x99s like the children cryin\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nthe fathers and mothers take things from \xe2\x80\x99em. There\xe2\x80\x99s One above knows\r\nbetter nor us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s poor work allays settin\xe2\x80\x99 the dead\r\nabove the livin\xe2\x80\x99. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe better if folks \xe2\x80\x99ud make much on us beforehand, i\xe2\x80\x99stid o\xe2\x80\x99 beginnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen we\xe2\x80\x99re gone. It\xe2\x80\x99s but little good you\xe2\x80\x99ll do a-watering the last\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s crop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s words were, as\r\nusual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to\r\nchange the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna\r\nhad a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to\r\nsee what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it\xe2\x80\x99s got broke,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a nice job to mend it\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99ll want a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 turning.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come as soon as you can now, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see\r\nwhere Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not\r\nwithout a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about\r\nher than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white\r\nhot-house plant, with a very long name\xe2\x80\x94a Scotch name, she supposed,\r\nsince people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the\r\nopportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of\r\nhim that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression\r\non Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face as she listened to the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s small talk. Yet in\r\nher secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would\r\nperhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not\r\nthat she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information\r\nwould be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was\r\nvery fond of giving information.\r\n\r\nMr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were\r\nreceived coldly, for to shift one\xe2\x80\x99s point of view beyond certain limits\r\nis impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us\r\naware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble\r\nunderstanding\xe2\x80\x94it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,\r\nMr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth\r\nyear of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and\r\nbachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little\r\nheated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9class was well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ca man might do worse\xe2\x80\x9d; but\r\non convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.\r\n\r\nMartin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who \xe2\x80\x9cknew his\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he\r\nwas less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said\r\nin confidence to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mighty fond o\xe2\x80\x99 Craig, but for my\r\npart, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s welly like a cock as thinks the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rose o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npurpose to hear him crow.\xe2\x80\x9d For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable\r\ngardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of\r\nhimself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his\r\nhead forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his\r\nbreeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the\r\nadvantage of being Scotch, and not his \xe2\x80\x9cbringing up\xe2\x80\x9d; for except that\r\nhe had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from\r\nthat of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a\r\nFrench teacher is Parisian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before the good slow farmer had time to\r\nspeak, \xe2\x80\x9cye\xe2\x80\x99ll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking. The\r\nglass sticks at \xe2\x80\x98change,\xe2\x80\x99 and ye may rely upo\xe2\x80\x99 my word as we\xe2\x80\x99ll ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmore downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue\r\ncloud there upo\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x99rizon\xe2\x80\x94ye know what I mean by the \xe2\x80\x99rizon, where\r\nthe land and sky seems to meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, I see the cloud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99rizon or no \xe2\x80\x99rizon.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s right o\xe2\x80\x99er Mike Holdsworth\xe2\x80\x99s fallow, and a foul fallow it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you mark my words, as that cloud \xe2\x80\x99ull spread o\xe2\x80\x99er the sky pretty\r\nnigh as quick as you\xe2\x80\x99d spread a tarpaulin over one o\xe2\x80\x99 your hay-ricks.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing to ha\xe2\x80\x99 studied the look o\xe2\x80\x99 the clouds. Lord bless\r\nyou! Th\xe2\x80\x99 met\xe2\x80\x99orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npretty sight o\xe2\x80\x99 things I could let _them_ up to, if they\xe2\x80\x99d just come to\r\nme. And how are _you_, Mrs. Poyser?\xe2\x80\x94thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 getherin\xe2\x80\x99 the red\r\ncurrants soon, I reckon. You\xe2\x80\x99d a deal better gether \xe2\x80\x99em afore they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\no\xe2\x80\x99erripe, wi\xe2\x80\x99 such weather as we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look forward to. How do ye\r\ndo, Mistress Bede?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by\r\nthe way to Adam and Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope y\xe2\x80\x99 enjoyed them spinach and\r\ngooseberries as I sent Chester with th\xe2\x80\x99 other day. If ye want\r\nvegetables while ye\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble, ye know where to come to. It\xe2\x80\x99s well\r\nknown I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving other folks\xe2\x80\x99 things away, for when I\xe2\x80\x99ve supplied\r\nthe house, the garden\xe2\x80\x99s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nold squire could get as \xe2\x80\x99ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone\r\nasking whether he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run my calkilation fine, I\r\ncan tell you, to make sure o\xe2\x80\x99 getting back the money as I pay the\r\nsquire. I should like to see some o\xe2\x80\x99 them fellows as make the almanecks\r\nlooking as far before their noses as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do every year as\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look pretty fur, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on\r\none side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\r\ncould come truer nor that pictur o\xe2\x80\x99 the cock wi\xe2\x80\x99 the big spurs, as has\r\ngot its head knocked down wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 anchor, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 firin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 the ships\r\nbehind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it\xe2\x80\x99s come as\r\ntrue as th\xe2\x80\x99 Bible. Why, th\xe2\x80\x99 cock\xe2\x80\x99s France, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 anchor\xe2\x80\x99s Nelson\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthey told us that beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPee\xe2\x80\x94ee-eh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig. \xe2\x80\x9cA man doesna want to see fur to know as\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 English \xe2\x80\x99ull beat the French. Why, I know upo\xe2\x80\x99 good authority as\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an\xe2\x80\x99 they live upo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nspoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular\r\nknowledge o\xe2\x80\x99 the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers\r\nare to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why,\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm\xe2\x80\x99s thicker nor\r\na Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s body, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstays; and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough, for they\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing i\xe2\x80\x99 their insides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ntalking to him o\xe2\x80\x99 Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s only gone to Eagledale for a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 fishing; I reckon he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe back again afore many days are o\xe2\x80\x99er, for he\xe2\x80\x99s to be at all th\xe2\x80\x99\r\narranging and preparing o\xe2\x80\x99 things for the comin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 age o\xe2\x80\x99 the 30th o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nJuly. But he\xe2\x80\x99s fond o\xe2\x80\x99 getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation,\r\nbut the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the\r\nturning in the road where Adam and his companions must say \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if\r\nhe had not accepted Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly\r\nseconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not\r\nto make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and\r\ndislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr.\r\nCraig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall\r\nFarm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\r\nto say again\xe2\x80\x99 him, on\xe2\x80\x99y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o\xe2\x80\x99er again,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 hatched different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down\r\nto the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory\r\nhad taken the place of a long, long anxiety\xe2\x80\x94where Adam would never have\r\nto ask again as he entered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to\r\nthe pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm\xe2\x80\x94all with quiet minds,\r\nexcept Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more\r\npuzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite\r\nvoluntary; he need not have gone\xe2\x80\x94he would not have gone if he had\r\nwanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be\r\npleasant to her again if her Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s vision was not to be\r\nfulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and\r\ndoubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again,\r\nof meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that\r\neager yearning which one may call the \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing pain\xe2\x80\x9d of passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\nAdam on a Working Day\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mr. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy, the dark-blue cloud dispersed\r\nitself without having produced the threatened consequences. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nweather\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as he observed the next morning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe weather, you see, \xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nticklish thing, an\xe2\x80\x99 a fool \xe2\x80\x99ull hit on\xe2\x80\x99t sometimes when a wise man\r\nmisses; that\xe2\x80\x99s why the almanecks get so much credit. It\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nchancy things as fools thrive on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unreasonable behaviour of the weather, however, could displease no\r\none else in Hayslope besides Mr. Craig. All hands were to be out in the\r\nmeadows this morning as soon as the dew had risen; the wives and\r\ndaughters did double work in every farmhouse, that the maids might give\r\ntheir help in tossing the hay; and when Adam was marching along the\r\nlanes, with his basket of tools over his shoulder, he caught the sound\r\nof jocose talk and ringing laughter from behind the hedges. The jocose\r\ntalk of hay-makers is best at a distance; like those clumsy bells round\r\nthe cows\xe2\x80\x99 necks, it has rather a coarse sound when it comes close, and\r\nmay even grate on your ears painfully; but heard from far off, it\r\nmingles very prettily with the other joyous sounds of nature. Men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuscles move better when their souls are making merry music, though\r\ntheir merriment is of a poor blundering sort, not at all like the\r\nmerriment of birds.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps there is no time in a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day more cheering than when\r\nthe warmth of the sun is just beginning to triumph over the freshness\r\nof the morning\xe2\x80\x94when there is just a lingering hint of early coolness to\r\nkeep off languor under the delicious influence of warmth. The reason\r\nAdam was walking along the lanes at this time was because his work for\r\nthe rest of the day lay at a country-house about three miles off, which\r\nwas being put in repair for the son of a neighbouring squire; and he\r\nhad been busy since early morning with the packing of panels, doors,\r\nand chimney-pieces, in a waggon which was now gone on before him, while\r\nJonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback, to await\r\nits arrival and direct the workmen.\r\n\r\nThis little walk was a rest to Adam, and he was unconsciously under the\r\ncharm of the moment. It was summer morning in his heart, and he saw\r\nHetty in the sunshine\xe2\x80\x94a sunshine without glare, with slanting rays that\r\ntremble between the delicate shadows of the leaves. He thought,\r\nyesterday when he put out his hand to her as they came out of church,\r\nthat there was a touch of melancholy kindness in her face, such as he\r\nhad not seen before, and he took it as a sign that she had some\r\nsympathy with his family trouble. Poor fellow! That touch of melancholy\r\ncame from quite another source, but how was he to know? We look at the\r\none little woman\xe2\x80\x99s face we love as we look at the face of our mother\r\nearth, and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings. It was\r\nimpossible for Adam not to feel that what had happened in the last week\r\nhad brought the prospect of marriage nearer to him. Hitherto he had\r\nfelt keenly the danger that some other man might step in and get\r\npossession of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s heart and hand, while he himself was still in a\r\nposition that made him shrink from asking her to accept him. Even if he\r\nhad had a strong hope that she was fond of him\xe2\x80\x94and his hope was far\r\nfrom being strong\xe2\x80\x94he had been too heavily burdened with other claims to\r\nprovide a home for himself and Hetty\xe2\x80\x94a home such as he could expect her\r\nto be content with after the comfort and plenty of the Farm. Like all\r\nstrong natures, Adam had confidence in his ability to achieve something\r\nin the future; he felt sure he should some day, if he lived, be able to\r\nmaintain a family and make a good broad path for himself; but he had\r\ntoo cool a head not to estimate to the full the obstacles that were to\r\nbe overcome. And the time would be so long! And there was Hetty, like a\r\nbright-cheeked apple hanging over the orchard wall, within sight of\r\neverybody, and everybody must long for her! To be sure, if she loved\r\nhim very much, she would be content to wait for him: but _did_ she love\r\nhim? His hopes had never risen so high that he had dared to ask her. He\r\nwas clear-sighted enough to be aware that her uncle and aunt would have\r\nlooked kindly on his suit, and indeed, without this encouragement he\r\nwould never have persevered in going to the Farm; but it was impossible\r\nto come to any but fluctuating conclusions about Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. She\r\nwas like a kitten, and had the same distractingly pretty looks, that\r\nmeant nothing, for everybody that came near her.\r\n\r\nBut now he could not help saying to himself that the heaviest part of\r\nhis burden was removed, and that even before the end of another year\r\nhis circumstances might be brought into a shape that would allow him to\r\nthink of marrying. It would always be a hard struggle with his mother,\r\nhe knew: she would be jealous of any wife he might choose, and she had\r\nset her mind especially against Hetty\xe2\x80\x94perhaps for no other reason than\r\nthat she suspected Hetty to be the woman he _had_ chosen. It would\r\nnever do, he feared, for his mother to live in the same house with him\r\nwhen he was married; and yet how hard she would think it if he asked\r\nher to leave him! Yes, there was a great deal of pain to be gone\r\nthrough with his mother, but it was a case in which he must make her\r\nfeel that his will was strong\xe2\x80\x94it would be better for her in the end.\r\nFor himself, he would have liked that they should all live together\r\ntill Seth was married, and they might have built a bit themselves to\r\nthe old house, and made more room. He did not like \xe2\x80\x9cto part wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x9d: they had hardly ever been separated for more than a day since\r\nthey were born.\r\n\r\nBut Adam had no sooner caught his imagination leaping forward in this\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94making arrangements for an uncertain future\xe2\x80\x94than he checked\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cA pretty building I\xe2\x80\x99m making, without either bricks or\r\ntimber. I\xe2\x80\x99m up i\xe2\x80\x99 the garret a\xe2\x80\x99ready, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t so much as dug the\r\nfoundation.\xe2\x80\x9d Whenever Adam was strongly convinced of any proposition,\r\nit took the form of a principle in his mind: it was knowledge to be\r\nacted on, as much as the knowledge that damp will cause rust. Perhaps\r\nhere lay the secret of the hardness he had accused himself of: he had\r\ntoo little fellow-feeling with the weakness that errs in spite of\r\nforeseen consequences. Without this fellow-feeling, how are we to get\r\nenough patience and charity towards our stumbling, falling companions\r\nin the long and changeful journey? And there is but one way in which a\r\nstrong determined soul can learn it\xe2\x80\x94by getting his heart-strings bound\r\nround the weak and erring, so that he must share not only the outward\r\nconsequence of their error, but their inward suffering. That is a long\r\nand hard lesson, and Adam had at present only learned the alphabet of\r\nit in his father\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death, which, by annihilating in an instant\r\nall that had stimulated his indignation, had sent a sudden rush of\r\nthought and memory over what had claimed his pity and tenderness.\r\n\r\nBut it was Adam\xe2\x80\x99s strength, not its correlative hardness, that\r\ninfluenced his meditations this morning. He had long made up his mind\r\nthat it would be wrong as well as foolish for him to marry a blooming\r\nyoung girl, so long as he had no other prospect than that of growing\r\npoverty with a growing family. And his savings had been so constantly\r\ndrawn upon (besides the terrible sweep of paying for Seth\xe2\x80\x99s substitute\r\nin the militia) that he had not enough money beforehand to furnish even\r\na small cottage, and keep something in reserve against a rainy day. He\r\nhad good hope that he should be \xe2\x80\x9cfirmer on his legs\xe2\x80\x9d by and by; but he\r\ncould not be satisfied with a vague confidence in his arm and brain; he\r\nmust have definite plans, and set about them at once. The partnership\r\nwith Jonathan Burge was not to be thought of at present\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nthings implicitly tacked to it that he could not accept; but Adam\r\nthought that he and Seth might carry on a little business for\r\nthemselves in addition to their journeyman\xe2\x80\x99s work, by buying a small\r\nstock of superior wood and making articles of household furniture, for\r\nwhich Adam had no end of contrivances. Seth might gain more by working\r\nat separate jobs under Adam\xe2\x80\x99s direction than by his journeyman\xe2\x80\x99s work,\r\nand Adam, in his overhours, could do all the \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d work that required\r\npeculiar skill. The money gained in this way, with the good wages he\r\nreceived as foreman, would soon enable them to get beforehand with the\r\nworld, so sparingly as they would all live now. No sooner had this\r\nlittle plan shaped itself in his mind than he began to be busy with\r\nexact calculations about the wood to be bought and the particular\r\narticle of furniture that should be undertaken first\xe2\x80\x94a kitchen cupboard\r\nof his own contrivance, with such an ingenious arrangement of\r\nsliding-doors and bolts, such convenient nooks for stowing household\r\nprovender, and such a symmetrical result to the eye, that every good\r\nhousewife would be in raptures with it, and fall through all the\r\ngradations of melancholy longing till her husband promised to buy it\r\nfor her. Adam pictured to himself Mrs. Poyser examining it with her\r\nkeen eye and trying in vain to find out a deficiency; and, of course,\r\nclose to Mrs. Poyser stood Hetty, and Adam was again beguiled from\r\ncalculations and contrivances into dreams and hopes. Yes, he would go\r\nand see her this evening\xe2\x80\x94it was so long since he had been at the Hall\r\nFarm. He would have liked to go to the night-school, to see why Bartle\r\nMassey had not been at church yesterday, for he feared his old friend\r\nwas ill; but, unless he could manage both visits, this last must be put\r\noff till to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94the desire to be near Hetty and to speak to her\r\nagain was too strong.\r\n\r\nAs he made up his mind to this, he was coming very near to the end of\r\nhis walk, within the sound of the hammers at work on the refitting of\r\nthe old house. The sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his\r\nwork is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who\r\nhas to bear his part in the overture: the strong fibres begin their\r\naccustomed thrill, and what was a moment before joy, vexation, or\r\nambition, begins its change into energy. All passion becomes strength\r\nwhen it has an outlet from the narrow limits of our personal lot in the\r\nlabour of our right arm, the cunning of our right hand, or the still,\r\ncreative activity of our thought. Look at Adam through the rest of the\r\nday, as he stands on the scaffolding with the two-feet ruler in his\r\nhand, whistling low while he considers how a difficulty about a\r\nfloor-joist or a window-frame is to be overcome; or as he pushes one of\r\nthe younger workmen aside and takes his place in upheaving a weight of\r\ntimber, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet alone, lad! Thee\xe2\x80\x99st got too much gristle i\xe2\x80\x99 thy\r\nbones yet\xe2\x80\x9d; or as he fixes his keen black eyes on the motions of a\r\nworkman on the other side of the room and warns him that his distances\r\nare not right. Look at this broad-shouldered man with the bare muscular\r\narms, and the thick, firm, black hair tossed about like trodden\r\nmeadow-grass whenever he takes off his paper cap, and with the strong\r\nbarytone voice bursting every now and then into loud and solemn\r\npsalm-tunes, as if seeking an outlet for superfluous strength, yet\r\npresently checking himself, apparently crossed by some thought which\r\njars with the singing. Perhaps, if you had not been already in the\r\nsecret, you might not have guessed what sad memories, what warm\r\naffection, what tender fluttering hopes, had their home in this\r\nathletic body with the broken finger-nails\xe2\x80\x94in this rough man, who knew\r\nno better lyrics than he could find in the Old and New Version and an\r\noccasional hymn; who knew the smallest possible amount of profane\r\nhistory; and for whom the motion and shape of the earth, the course of\r\nthe sun, and the changes of the seasons lay in the region of mystery\r\njust made visible by fragmentary knowledge. It had cost Adam a great\r\ndeal of trouble and work in overhours to know what he knew over and\r\nabove the secrets of his handicraft, and that acquaintance with\r\nmechanics and figures, and the nature of the materials he worked with,\r\nwhich was made easy to him by inborn inherited faculty\xe2\x80\x94to get the\r\nmastery of his pen, and write a plain hand, to spell without any other\r\nmistakes than must in fairness be attributed to the unreasonable\r\ncharacter of orthography rather than to any deficiency in the speller,\r\nand, moreover, to learn his musical notes and part-singing. Besides all\r\nthis, he had read his Bible, including the apocryphal books; Poor\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x99s Almanac, Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Living and Dying, The Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nProgress, with Bunyan\xe2\x80\x99s Life and Holy War, a great deal of Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDictionary, Valentine and Orson, and part of a History of Babylon,\r\nwhich Bartle Massey had lent him. He might have had many more books\r\nfrom Bartle Massey, but he had no time for reading \xe2\x80\x9cthe commin print,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas Lisbeth called it, so busy as he was with figures in all the leisure\r\nmoments which he did not fill up with extra carpentry.\r\n\r\nAdam, you perceive, was by no means a marvellous man, nor, properly\r\nspeaking, a genius, yet I will not pretend that his was an ordinary\r\ncharacter among workmen; and it would not be at all a safe conclusion\r\nthat the next best man you may happen to see with a basket of tools\r\nover his shoulder and a paper cap on his head has the strong conscience\r\nand the strong sense, the blended susceptibility and self-command, of\r\nour friend Adam. He was not an average man. Yet such men as he are\r\nreared here and there in every generation of our peasant artisans\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nan inheritance of affections nurtured by a simple family life of common\r\nneed and common industry, and an inheritance of faculties trained in\r\nskilful courageous labour: they make their way upwards, rarely as\r\ngeniuses, most commonly as painstaking honest men, with the skill and\r\nconscience to do well the tasks that lie before them. Their lives have\r\nno discernible echo beyond the neighbourhood where they dwelt, but you\r\nare almost sure to find there some good piece of road, some building,\r\nsome application of mineral produce, some improvement in farming\r\npractice, some reform of parish abuses, with which their names are\r\nassociated by one or two generations after them. Their employers were\r\nthe richer for them, the work of their hands has worn well, and the\r\nwork of their brains has guided well the hands of other men. They went\r\nabout in their youth in flannel or paper caps, in coats black with\r\ncoal-dust or streaked with lime and red paint; in old age their white\r\nhairs are seen in a place of honour at church and at market, and they\r\ntell their well-dressed sons and daughters, seated round the bright\r\nhearth on winter evenings, how pleased they were when they first earned\r\ntheir twopence a-day. Others there are who die poor and never put off\r\nthe workman\xe2\x80\x99s coat on weekdays. They have not had the art of getting\r\nrich, but they are men of trust, and when they die before the work is\r\nall out of them, it is as if some main screw had got loose in a\r\nmachine; the master who employed them says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I find their\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\nAdam Visits the Hall Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam came back from his work in the empty waggon\xe2\x80\x94that was why he had\r\nchanged his clothes\xe2\x80\x94and was ready to set out to the Hall Farm when it\r\nstill wanted a quarter to seven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s thee got thy Sunday cloose on for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth complainingly,\r\nas he came downstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cThee artna goin\xe2\x80\x99 to th\xe2\x80\x99 school i\xe2\x80\x99 thy best\r\ncoat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Hall Farm, but\r\nmayhap I may go to the school after, so thee mustna wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit\r\nlate. Seth \xe2\x80\x99ull be at home in half an hour\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s only gone to the\r\nvillage; so thee wutna mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, an\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s thee got thy best cloose on for to go to th\xe2\x80\x99 Hall Farm?\r\nThe Poyser folks see\xe2\x80\x99d thee in \xe2\x80\x99em yesterday, I warrand. What dost mean\r\nby turnin\xe2\x80\x99 worki\xe2\x80\x99day into Sunday a-that\xe2\x80\x99n? It\xe2\x80\x99s poor keepin\xe2\x80\x99 company\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 folks as donna like to see thee i\xe2\x80\x99 thy workin\xe2\x80\x99 jacket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, mother, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, putting on his hat and\r\ngoing out.\r\n\r\nBut he had no sooner gone a few paces beyond the door than Lisbeth\r\nbecame uneasy at the thought that she had vexed him. Of course, the\r\nsecret of her objection to the best clothes was her suspicion that they\r\nwere put on for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s sake; but deeper than all her peevishness lay\r\nthe need that her son should love her. She hurried after him, and laid\r\nhold of his arm before he had got half-way down to the brook, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lad, thee wutna go away angered wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy mother, an\xe2\x80\x99 her got\r\nnought to do but to sit by hersen an\xe2\x80\x99 think on thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, gravely, and standing still while he put\r\nhis arm on her shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not angered. But I wish, for thy own\r\nsake, thee\xe2\x80\x99dst be more contented to let me do what I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind\r\nto do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be no other than a good son to thee as long as we\r\nlive. But a man has other feelings besides what he owes to\xe2\x80\x99s father and\r\nmother, and thee oughtna to want to rule over me body and soul. And\r\nthee must make up thy mind as I\xe2\x80\x99ll not give way to thee where I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nright to do what I like. So let us have no more words about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, not willing to show that she felt the real bearing\r\nof Adam\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x99 who likes to see thee i\xe2\x80\x99 thy best cloose better\r\nnor thy mother? An\xe2\x80\x99 when thee\xe2\x80\x99st got thy face washed as clean as the\r\nsmooth white pibble, an\xe2\x80\x99 thy hair combed so nice, and thy eyes\r\na-sparklin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94what else is there as thy old mother should like to look at\r\nhalf so well? An\xe2\x80\x99 thee sha\xe2\x80\x99t put on thy Sunday cloose when thee lik\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nfor me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er plague thee no moor about\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; good-bye, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, kissing her and hurrying\r\naway. He saw there was no other means of putting an end to the\r\ndialogue. Lisbeth stood still on the spot, shading her eyes and looking\r\nafter him till he was quite out of sight. She felt to the full all the\r\nmeaning that had lain in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s words, and, as she lost sight of him\r\nand turned back slowly into the house, she said aloud to herself\xe2\x80\x94for it\r\nwas her way to speak her thoughts aloud in the long days when her\r\nhusband and sons were at their work\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be tellin\xe2\x80\x99 me as he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to bring her home one o\xe2\x80\x99 these days; an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99ll be missis o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nme, and I mun look on, belike, while she uses the blue-edged platters,\r\nand breaks \xe2\x80\x99em, mayhap, though there\xe2\x80\x99s ne\xe2\x80\x99er been one broke sin\xe2\x80\x99 my old\r\nman an\xe2\x80\x99 me bought \xe2\x80\x99em at the fair twenty \xe2\x80\x99ear come next Whissuntide.\r\nEh!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, still louder, as she caught up her knitting from the\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er knit the lad\xe2\x80\x99s stockin\xe2\x80\x99s, nor foot \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nnayther, while I live; an\xe2\x80\x99 when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, he\xe2\x80\x99ll bethink him as nobody\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull ne\xe2\x80\x99er fit\xe2\x80\x99s leg an\xe2\x80\x99 foot as his old mother did. She\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 narrowin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 heelin\xe2\x80\x99, I warrand, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99ll make a long toe\r\nas he canna get\xe2\x80\x99s boot on. That\xe2\x80\x99s what comes o\xe2\x80\x99 marr\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 young wenches.\r\nI war gone thirty, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 feyther too, afore we war married; an\xe2\x80\x99 young\r\nenough too. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a poor dratchell by then _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ thirty,\r\na-marr\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 a-that\xe2\x80\x99n, afore her teeth\xe2\x80\x99s all come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam walked so fast that he was at the yard-gate before seven. Martin\r\nPoyser and the grandfather were not yet come in from the meadow: every\r\none was in the meadow, even to the black-and-tan terrier\xe2\x80\x94no one kept\r\nwatch in the yard but the bull-dog; and when Adam reached the\r\nhouse-door, which stood wide open, he saw there was no one in the\r\nbright clean house-place. But he guessed where Mrs. Poyser and some one\r\nelse would be, quite within hearing; so he knocked on the door and said\r\nin his strong voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Poyser within?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Mr. Bede, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Poyser called out from the dairy.\r\nShe always gave Adam this title when she received him in her own house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may come into the dairy if you will, for I canna justly leave the\r\ncheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam walked into the dairy, where Mrs. Poyser and Nancy were crushing\r\nthe first evening cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you might think you war come to a dead-house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser,\r\nas he stood in the open doorway; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re all i\xe2\x80\x99 the meadow; but\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be in afore long, for they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving the hay cocked\r\nto-night, ready for carrying first thing to-morrow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been forced t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhave Nancy in, upo\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99count as Hetty must gether the red currants\r\nto-night; the fruit allays ripens so contrairy, just when every hand\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwanted. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s no trustin\xe2\x80\x99 the children to gether it, for they put\r\nmore into their own mouths nor into the basket; you might as well set\r\nthe wasps to gether the fruit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam longed to say he would go into the garden till Mr. Poyser came in,\r\nbut he was not quite courageous enough, so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could be looking\r\nat your spinning-wheel, then, and see what wants doing to it. Perhaps\r\nit stands in the house, where I can find it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve put it away in the right-hand parlour; but let it be till I\r\ncan fetch it and show it you. I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad now if you\xe2\x80\x99d go into the\r\ngarden and tell Hetty to send Totty in. The child \xe2\x80\x99ull run in if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntold, an\xe2\x80\x99 I know Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s lettin\xe2\x80\x99 her eat too many currants. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmuch obliged to you, Mr. Bede, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go and send her in; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the York and Lankester roses beautiful in the garden now\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlike to see \xe2\x80\x99em. But you\xe2\x80\x99d like a drink o\xe2\x80\x99 whey first, p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps; I know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re fond o\xe2\x80\x99 whey, as most folks is when they hanna got to crush it\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9ca drink o\xe2\x80\x99 whey\xe2\x80\x99s allays a treat\r\nto me. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have it than beer any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, reaching a small white basin that stood\r\non the shelf, and dipping it into the whey-tub, \xe2\x80\x9cthe smell o\xe2\x80\x99 bread\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweet t\xe2\x80\x99 everybody but the baker. The Miss Irwines allays say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nMrs. Poyser, I envy you your dairy; and I envy you your chickens; and\r\nwhat a beautiful thing a farm-house is, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 I say, \xe2\x80\x98Yes; a\r\nfarm-house is a fine thing for them as look on, an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t know the\r\nliftin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 the stannin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 the worritin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 inside as belongs\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs. Poyser, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to live anywhere else but in a\r\nfarm-house, so well as you manage it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, taking the basin;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand there can be nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine milch cow,\r\nstanding up to\xe2\x80\x99ts knees in pasture, and the new milk frothing in the\r\npail, and the fresh butter ready for market, and the calves, and the\r\npoultry. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to your health, and may you allays have strength to\r\nlook after your own dairy, and set a pattern t\xe2\x80\x99 all the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives\r\nin the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser was not to be caught in the weakness of smiling at a\r\ncompliment, but a quiet complacency over-spread her face like a\r\nstealing sunbeam, and gave a milder glance than usual to her blue-grey\r\neyes, as she looked at Adam drinking the whey. Ah! I think I taste that\r\nwhey now\xe2\x80\x94with a flavour so delicate that one can hardly distinguish it\r\nfrom an odour, and with that soft gliding warmth that fills one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination with a still, happy dreaminess. And the light music of the\r\ndropping whey is in my ears, mingling with the twittering of a bird\r\noutside the wire network window\xe2\x80\x94the window overlooking the garden, and\r\nshaded by tall Guelder roses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little more, Mr. Bede?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, as Adam set down the\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go into the garden now, and send in the little\r\nlass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, do; and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam walked round by the rick-yard, at present empty of ricks, to the\r\nlittle wooden gate leading into the garden\xe2\x80\x94once the well-tended\r\nkitchen-garden of a manor-house; now, but for the handsome brick wall\r\nwith stone coping that ran along one side of it, a true farmhouse\r\ngarden, with hardy perennial flowers, unpruned fruit-trees, and kitchen\r\nvegetables growing together in careless, half-neglected abundance. In\r\nthat leafy, flowery, bushy time, to look for any one in this garden was\r\nlike playing at \xe2\x80\x9chide-and-seek.\xe2\x80\x9d There were the tall hollyhocks\r\nbeginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their pink, white, and\r\nyellow; there were the syringas and Guelder roses, all large and\r\ndisorderly for want of trimming; there were leafy walls of scarlet\r\nbeans and late peas; there was a row of bushy filberts in one\r\ndirection, and in another a huge apple-tree making a barren circle\r\nunder its low-spreading boughs. But what signified a barren patch or\r\ntwo? The garden was so large. There was always a superfluity of broad\r\nbeans\xe2\x80\x94it took nine or ten of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s strides to get to the end of the\r\nuncut grass walk that ran by the side of them; and as for other\r\nvegetables, there was so much more room than was necessary for them\r\nthat in the rotation of crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was\r\nof yearly occurrence on one spot or other. The very rose-trees at which\r\nAdam stopped to pluck one looked as if they grew wild; they were all\r\nhuddled together in bushy masses, now flaunting with wide-open petals,\r\nalmost all of them of the streaked pink-and-white kind, which doubtless\r\ndated from the union of the houses of York and Lancaster. Adam was wise\r\nenough to choose a compact Provence rose that peeped out half-smothered\r\nby its flaunting scentless neighbours, and held it in his hand\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nthought he should be more at ease holding something in his hand\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\nwalked on to the far end of the garden, where he remembered there was\r\nthe largest row of currant-trees, not far off from the great yew-tree\r\narbour.\r\n\r\nBut he had not gone many steps beyond the roses, when he heard the\r\nshaking of a bough, and a boy\xe2\x80\x99s voice saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, Totty, hold\r\nout your pinny\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a duck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice came from the boughs of a tall cherry-tree, where Adam had no\r\ndifficulty in discerning a small blue-pinafored figure perched in a\r\ncommodious position where the fruit was thickest. Doubtless Totty was\r\nbelow, behind the screen of peas. Yes\xe2\x80\x94with her bonnet hanging down her\r\nback, and her fat face, dreadfully smeared with red juice, turned up\r\ntowards the cherry-tree, while she held her little round hole of a\r\nmouth and her red-stained pinafore to receive the promised downfall. I\r\nam sorry to say, more than half the cherries that fell were hard and\r\nyellow instead of juicy and red; but Totty spent no time in useless\r\nregrets, and she was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Totty, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your cherries. Run into the house with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em to Mother\xe2\x80\x94she wants you\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s in the dairy. Run in this\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a good little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke, a\r\nceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to\r\ncherry-eating; and when he set her down she trotted off quite silently\r\ntowards the house, sucking her cherries as she went along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTommy, my lad, take care you\xe2\x80\x99re not shot for a little thieving bird,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Adam, as he walked on towards the currant-trees.\r\n\r\nHe could see there was a large basket at the end of the row: Hetty\r\nwould not be far off, and Adam already felt as if she were looking at\r\nhim. Yet when he turned the corner she was standing with her back\r\ntowards him, and stooping to gather the low-hanging fruit. Strange that\r\nshe had not heard him coming! Perhaps it was because she was making the\r\nleaves rustle. She started when she became conscious that some one was\r\nnear\xe2\x80\x94started so violently that she dropped the basin with the currants\r\nin it, and then, when she saw it was Adam, she turned from pale to deep\r\nred. That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness. Hetty had\r\nnever blushed at seeing him before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI frightened you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a delicious sense that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsignify what he said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet _me_ pick the currants up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the\r\ngrass-plot, and Adam, as he rose and gave her the basin again, looked\r\nstraight into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the\r\nfirst moments of hopeful love.\r\n\r\nHetty did not turn away her eyes; her blush had subsided, and she met\r\nhis glance with a quiet sadness, which contented Adam because it was so\r\nunlike anything he had seen in her before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not many more currants to get,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndone now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; and he fetched the large basket, which was\r\nnearly full of currants, and set it close to them.\r\n\r\nNot a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas too full to speak, and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it.\r\nShe was not indifferent to his presence after all; she had blushed when\r\nshe saw him, and then there was that touch of sadness about her which\r\nmust surely mean love, since it was the opposite of her usual manner,\r\nwhich had often impressed him as indifference. And he could glance at\r\nher continually as she bent over the fruit, while the level evening\r\nsunbeams stole through the thick apple-tree boughs, and rested on her\r\nround cheek and neck as if they too were in love with her. It was to\r\nAdam the time that a man can least forget in after-life, the time when\r\nhe believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a slight\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94a word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an\r\neyelid\xe2\x80\x94that she is at least beginning to love him in return. The sign\r\nis so slight, it is scarcely perceptible to the ear or eye\xe2\x80\x94he could\r\ndescribe it to no one\xe2\x80\x94it is a mere feather-touch, yet it seems to have\r\nchanged his whole being, to have merged an uneasy yearning into a\r\ndelicious unconsciousness of everything but the present moment. So much\r\nof our early gladness vanishes utterly from our memory: we can never\r\nrecall the joy with which we laid our heads on our mother\xe2\x80\x99s bosom or\r\nrode on our father\xe2\x80\x99s back in childhood. Doubtless that joy is wrought\r\nup into our nature, as the sunlight of long-past mornings is wrought up\r\nin the soft mellowness of the apricot, but it is gone for ever from our\r\nimagination, and we can only _believe_ in the joy of childhood. But the\r\nfirst glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to\r\nthe last, and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as\r\nthe recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour of\r\nhappiness. It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to\r\ntenderness, that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last\r\nkeenness to the agony of despair.\r\n\r\nHetty bending over the red bunches, the level rays piercing the screen\r\nof apple-tree boughs, the length of bushy garden beyond, his own\r\nemotion as he looked at her and believed that she was thinking of him,\r\nand that there was no need for them to talk\xe2\x80\x94Adam remembered it all to\r\nthe last moment of his life.\r\n\r\nAnd Hetty? You know quite well that Adam was mistaken about her. Like\r\nmany other men, he thought the signs of love for another were signs of\r\nlove towards himself. When Adam was approaching unseen by her, she was\r\nabsorbed as usual in thinking and wondering about Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s possible\r\nreturn. The sound of any man\xe2\x80\x99s footstep would have affected her just in\r\nthe same way\xe2\x80\x94she would have _felt_ it might be Arthur before she had\r\ntime to see, and the blood that forsook her cheek in the agitation of\r\nthat momentary feeling would have rushed back again at the sight of any\r\none else just as much as at the sight of Adam. He was not wrong in\r\nthinking that a change had come over Hetty: the anxieties and fears of\r\na first passion, with which she was trembling, had become stronger than\r\nvanity, had given her for the first time that sense of helpless\r\ndependence on another\xe2\x80\x99s feeling which awakens the clinging deprecating\r\nwomanhood even in the shallowest girl that can ever experience it, and\r\ncreates in her a sensibility to kindness which found her quite hard\r\nbefore. For the first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing\r\nto her in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s timid yet manly tenderness. She wanted to be treated\r\nlovingly\xe2\x80\x94oh, it was very hard to bear this blank of absence, silence,\r\napparent indifference, after those moments of glowing love! She was not\r\nafraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and flattering\r\nspeeches like her other admirers; he had always been so reserved to\r\nher; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave\r\nman loved her and was near her. It never entered into her mind that\r\nAdam was pitiable too\xe2\x80\x94that Adam too must suffer one day.\r\n\r\nHetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to\r\nthe man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love\r\nanother. It was a very old story, but Adam knew nothing about it, so he\r\ndrank in the sweet delusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, after a little while. \xe2\x80\x9cAunt wants me to leave\r\nsome on the trees. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take \xe2\x80\x99em in now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very well I came to carry the basket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam \xe2\x80\x9cfor it \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen too heavy for your little arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 carried it with both hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cand been as long getting into the\r\nhouse as a little ant carrying a caterpillar. Have you ever seen those\r\ntiny fellows carrying things four times as big as themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, indifferently, not caring to know the difficulties of\r\nant life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I used to watch \xe2\x80\x99em often when I was a lad. But now, you see, I\r\ncan carry the basket with one arm, as if it was an empty nutshell, and\r\ngive you th\xe2\x80\x99 other arm to lean on. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Such big arms as mine\r\nwere made for little arms like yours to lean on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty smiled faintly and put her arm within his. Adam looked down at\r\nher, but her eyes were turned dreamily towards another corner of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been to Eagledale?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as they walked slowly\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, pleased to have her ask a question about himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years ago, when I was a lad, I went with father to see about some\r\nwork there. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful sight\xe2\x80\x94rocks and caves such as you never\r\nsaw in your life. I never had a right notion o\xe2\x80\x99 rocks till I went\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long did it take to get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it took us the best part o\xe2\x80\x99 two days\xe2\x80\x99 walking. But it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nof a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey for anybody as has got a first-rate nag. The captain\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud get there in nine or ten hours, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, he\xe2\x80\x99s such a rider.\r\nAnd I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s back again to-morrow; he\xe2\x80\x99s too active to\r\nrest long in that lonely place, all by himself, for there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but\r\na bit of a inn i\xe2\x80\x99 that part where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to fish. I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d got\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 estate in his hands; that \xe2\x80\x99ud be the right thing for him, for it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud give him plenty to do, and he\xe2\x80\x99d do\xe2\x80\x99t well too, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nyoung; he\xe2\x80\x99s got better notions o\xe2\x80\x99 things than many a man twice his age.\r\nHe spoke very handsome to me th\xe2\x80\x99 other day about lending me money to\r\nset up i\xe2\x80\x99 business; and if things came round that way, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be\r\nbeholding to him nor to any man i\xe2\x80\x99 the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty\r\nwould be pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend\r\nhim; the fact entered into his future prospects, which he would like to\r\nseem promising in her eyes. And it was true that Hetty listened with an\r\ninterest which brought a new light into her eyes and a half-smile upon\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pretty the roses are now!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam continued, pausing to look at\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cSee! I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it myself.\r\nI think these as are all pink, and have got a finer sort o\xe2\x80\x99 green\r\nleaves, are prettier than the striped uns, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set down the basket and took the rose from his button-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt smells very sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthose striped uns have no smell.\r\nStick it in your frock, and then you can put it in water after. It \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe a pity to let it fade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty took the rose, smiling as she did so at the pleasant thought that\r\nArthur could so soon get back if he liked. There was a flash of hope\r\nand happiness in her mind, and with a sudden impulse of gaiety she did\r\nwhat she had very often done before\xe2\x80\x94stuck the rose in her hair a little\r\nabove the left ear. The tender admiration in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face was slightly\r\nshadowed by reluctant disapproval. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s love of finery was just the\r\nthing that would most provoke his mother, and he himself disliked it as\r\nmuch as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase;\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i\xe2\x80\x99 their hair,\r\nbut somehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see \xe2\x80\x99em; they allays put me i\xe2\x80\x99 mind o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\npainted women outside the shows at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on Fair. What can a woman\r\nhave to set her off better than her own hair, when it curls so, like\r\nyours? If a woman\xe2\x80\x99s young and pretty, I think you can see her good\r\nlooks all the better for her being plain dressed. Why, Dinah Morris\r\nlooks very nice, for all she wears such a plain cap and gown. It seems\r\nto me as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face doesna want flowers; it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like a flower\r\nitself. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure yours is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, with a little playful pout, taking the\r\nrose out of her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put one o\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s caps on when we go in,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I look better in it. She left one behind, so I can\r\ntake the pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\ndaresay it\xe2\x80\x99s a very ugly cap, and I used to think when I saw her here\r\nas it was nonsense for her to dress different t\xe2\x80\x99 other people; but I\r\nnever rightly noticed her till she came to see mother last week, and\r\nthen I thought the cap seemed to fit her face somehow as th \xe2\x80\x98acorn-cup\r\nfits th\xe2\x80\x99 acorn, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see her so well without it. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got another sort o\xe2\x80\x99 face; I\xe2\x80\x99d have you just as you are now,\r\nwithout anything t\xe2\x80\x99 interfere with your own looks. It\xe2\x80\x99s like when a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s singing a good tune\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t want t\xe2\x80\x99 hear bells tinkling and\r\ninterfering wi\xe2\x80\x99 the sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her arm and put it within his again, looking down on her\r\nfondly. He was afraid she should think he had lectured her, imagining,\r\nas we are apt to do, that she had perceived all the thoughts he had\r\nonly half-expressed. And the thing he dreaded most was lest any cloud\r\nshould come over this evening\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. For the world he would not\r\nhave spoken of his love to Hetty yet, till this commencing kindness\r\ntowards him should have grown into unmistakable love. In his\r\nimagination he saw long years of his future life stretching before him,\r\nblest with the right to call Hetty his own: he could be content with\r\nvery little at present. So he took up the basket of currants once more,\r\nand they went on towards the house.\r\n\r\nThe scene had quite changed in the half-hour that Adam had been in the\r\ngarden. The yard was full of life now: Marty was letting the screaming\r\ngeese through the gate, and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at\r\nhim; the granary-door was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it,\r\nafter dealing out the corn; the horses were being led out to watering,\r\namidst much barking of all the three dogs and many \xe2\x80\x9cwhups\xe2\x80\x9d from Tim the\r\nploughman, as if the heavy animals who held down their meek,\r\nintelligent heads, and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately, were\r\nlikely to rush wildly in every direction but the right. Everybody was\r\ncome back from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the\r\nhouse-place, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the\r\ngrandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with pleasant\r\nexpectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table. Mrs.\r\nPoyser had laid the cloth herself\xe2\x80\x94a cloth made of homespun linen, with\r\na shining checkered pattern on it, and of an agreeable whitey-brown\r\nhue, such as all sensible housewives like to see\xe2\x80\x94none of your bleached\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshop-rag\xe2\x80\x9d that would wear into holes in no time, but good homespun\r\nthat would last for two generations. The cold veal, the fresh lettuces,\r\nand the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had\r\ndined at half-past twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. On the large deal table against the\r\nwall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans, ready for\r\nAlick and his companions; for the master and servants ate their supper\r\nnot far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a\r\nremark about to-morrow morning\xe2\x80\x99s work occurred to Mr. Poyser, Alick was\r\nat hand to hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Adam, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! ye\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nhelping Hetty to gether the curran\xe2\x80\x99s, eh? Come, sit ye down, sit ye\r\ndown. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty near a three-week since y\xe2\x80\x99 had your supper with\r\nus; and the missis has got one of her rare stuffed chines. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99re come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, as she looked into the basket of currants to\r\nsee if the fruit was fine, \xe2\x80\x9crun upstairs and send Molly down. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nputting Totty to bed, and I want her to draw th\xe2\x80\x99 ale, for Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s busy\r\nyet i\xe2\x80\x99 the dairy. You can see to the child. But whativer did you let\r\nher run away from you along wi\xe2\x80\x99 Tommy for, and stuff herself wi\xe2\x80\x99 fruit\r\nas she can\xe2\x80\x99t eat a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 good victual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was said in a lower tone than usual, while her husband was talking\r\nto Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of\r\npropriety, and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated\r\nsharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her. That\r\nwould not be fair-play: every woman was young in her turn, and had her\r\nchances of matrimony, which it was a point of honour for other women\r\nnot to spoil\xe2\x80\x94just as one market-woman who has sold her own eggs must\r\nnot try to balk another of a customer.\r\n\r\nHetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an answer to\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and\r\nTommy and bring them in to supper.\r\n\r\nSoon they were all seated\xe2\x80\x94the two rosy lads, one on each side, by the\r\npale mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle.\r\nAlick too was come in, and was seated in his far corner, eating cold\r\nbroad beans out of a large dish with his pocket-knife, and finding a\r\nflavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest\r\npineapple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time that gell is drawing th\xe2\x80\x99 ale, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPoyser, when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nshe sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap, as there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t believe o\xe2\x80\x99 them wenches: they\xe2\x80\x99ll set the empty kettle o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfire, and then come an hour after to see if the water boils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s drawin\xe2\x80\x99 for the men too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cThee shouldst ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntold her to bring our jug up first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I might spend all the wind i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nbody, an\xe2\x80\x99 take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells everything\r\nas their own sharpness wonna tell \xe2\x80\x99em. Mr. Bede, will you take some\r\nvinegar with your lettuce? Aye you\xe2\x80\x99re i\xe2\x80\x99 the right not. It spoils the\r\nflavour o\xe2\x80\x99 the chine, to my thinking. It\xe2\x80\x99s poor eating where the\r\nflavour o\xe2\x80\x99 the meat lies i\xe2\x80\x99 the cruets. There\xe2\x80\x99s folks as make bad\r\nbutter and trusten to the salt t\xe2\x80\x99 hide it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly,\r\ncarrying a large jug, two small mugs, and four drinking-cans, all full\r\nof ale or small beer\xe2\x80\x94an interesting example of the prehensile power\r\npossessed by the human hand. Poor Molly\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was rather wider open\r\nthan usual, as she walked along with her eyes fixed on the double\r\ncluster of vessels in her hands, quite innocent of the expression in\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMolly, I niver knew your equils\xe2\x80\x94to think o\xe2\x80\x99 your poor mother as is a\r\nwidow, an\xe2\x80\x99 I took you wi\xe2\x80\x99 as good as no character, an\xe2\x80\x99 the times an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMolly had not seen the lightning, and the thunder shook her nerves the\r\nmore for the want of that preparation. With a vague alarmed sense that\r\nshe must somehow comport herself differently, she hastened her step a\r\nlittle towards the far deal table, where she might set down her\r\ncans\xe2\x80\x94caught her foot in her apron, which had become untied, and fell\r\nwith a crash and a splash into a pool of beer; whereupon a tittering\r\nexplosion from Marty and Tommy, and a serious \xe2\x80\x9cEllo!\xe2\x80\x9d from Mr. Poyser,\r\nwho saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs. Poyser, in a cutting tone, as she rose and\r\nwent towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the\r\nfragments of pottery. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I told you \xe2\x80\x99ud come, over and over\r\nagain; and there\xe2\x80\x99s your month\xe2\x80\x99s wage gone, and more, to pay for that\r\njug as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had i\xe2\x80\x99 the house this ten year, and nothing ever happened\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99t before; but the crockery you\xe2\x80\x99ve broke sin\xe2\x80\x99 here in th\xe2\x80\x99 house\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x99ud make a parson swear\xe2\x80\x94God forgi\xe2\x80\x99 me for saying so\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 if\r\nit had been boiling wort out o\xe2\x80\x99 the copper, it \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been the same,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been scalded and very like lamed for life, as there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nknowing but what you will be some day if you go on; for anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99d got the St. Vitus\xe2\x80\x99s Dance, to see the things you\xe2\x80\x99ve throwed\r\ndown. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity but what the bits was stacked up for you to see,\r\nthough it\xe2\x80\x99s neither seeing nor hearing as \xe2\x80\x99ull make much odds to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think you war case-hardened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Molly\xe2\x80\x99s tears were dropping fast by this time, and in her\r\ndesperation at the lively movement of the beer-stream towards Alick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs, she was converting her apron into a mop, while Mrs. Poyser,\r\nopening the cupboard, turned a blighting eye upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll do no good wi\xe2\x80\x99 crying an\xe2\x80\x99 making more wet to\r\nwipe up. It\xe2\x80\x99s all your own wilfulness, as I tell you, for there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnobody no call to break anything if they\xe2\x80\x99ll only go the right way to\r\nwork. But wooden folks had need ha\xe2\x80\x99 wooden things t\xe2\x80\x99 handle. And here\r\nmust I take the brown-and-white jug, as it\xe2\x80\x99s niver been used three\r\ntimes this year, and go down i\xe2\x80\x99 the cellar myself, and belike catch my\r\ndeath, and be laid up wi\xe2\x80\x99 inflammation....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brown-and-white\r\njug in her hand, when she caught sight of something at the other end of\r\nthe kitchen; perhaps it was because she was already trembling and\r\nnervous that the apparition had so strong an effect on her; perhaps\r\njug-breaking, like other crimes, has a contagious influence. However it\r\nwas, she stared and started like a ghost-seer, and the precious\r\nbrown-and-white jug fell to the ground, parting for ever with its spout\r\nand handle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ever anybody see the like?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a suddenly lowered\r\ntone, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s bewildered glance round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe jugs are\r\nbewitched, _I_ think. It\xe2\x80\x99s them nasty glazed handles\xe2\x80\x94they slip o\xe2\x80\x99er the\r\nfinger like a snail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee\xe2\x80\x99st let thy own whip fly i\xe2\x80\x99 thy face,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, who\r\nhad now joined in the laugh of the young ones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to look on and grin,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s times when the crockery seems alive an\xe2\x80\x99 flies out o\xe2\x80\x99 your hand\r\nlike a bird. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the glass, sometimes, \xe2\x80\x99ull crack as it stands.\r\nWhat is to be broke _will_ be broke, for I never dropped a thing i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nlife for want o\xe2\x80\x99 holding it, else I should never ha\xe2\x80\x99 kept the crockery\r\nall these \xe2\x80\x99ears as I bought at my own wedding. And Hetty, are you mad?\r\nWhativer do you mean by coming down i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, and making one think\r\nas there\xe2\x80\x99s a ghost a-walking i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new outbreak of laughter, while Mrs. Poyser was speaking, was caused,\r\nless by her sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of jug-breaking than\r\nby that strange appearance of Hetty, which had startled her aunt. The\r\nlittle minx had found a black gown of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, and pinned it close\r\nround her neck to look like Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s, had made her hair as flat as she\r\ncould, and had tied on one of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s high-crowned borderless net caps.\r\nThe thought of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s pale grave face and mild grey eyes, which the\r\nsight of the gown and cap brought with it, made it a laughable surprise\r\nenough to see them replaced by Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s round rosy cheeks and coquettish\r\ndark eyes. The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her, clapping\r\ntheir hands, and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up\r\nfrom his beans. Under cover of the noise, Mrs. Poyser went into the\r\nback kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter\r\nmeasure, which had some chance of being free from bewitchment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Hetty, lass, are ye turned Methodist?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, with that\r\ncomfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout\r\npeople. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must pull your face a deal longer before you\xe2\x80\x99ll do for\r\none; mustna she, Adam? How come you put them things on, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam said he liked Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s cap and gown better nor my clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHetty, sitting down demurely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says folks looks better in ugly\r\nclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking at her admiringly; \xe2\x80\x9cI only said they\r\nseemed to suit Dinah. But if I\xe2\x80\x99d said you\xe2\x80\x99d look pretty in \xe2\x80\x99em, I\r\nshould ha\xe2\x80\x99 said nothing but what was true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee thought\xe2\x80\x99st Hetty war a ghost, didstna?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser to\r\nhis wife, who now came back and took her seat again. \xe2\x80\x9cThee look\xe2\x80\x99dst as\r\nscared as scared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt little sinnifies how I looked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9clooks \xe2\x80\x99ull mend\r\nno jugs, nor laughing neither, as I see. Mr. Bede, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99ve to\r\nwait so long for your ale, but it\xe2\x80\x99s coming in a minute. Make yourself\r\nat home wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 cold potatoes: I know you like \xe2\x80\x99em. Tommy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nyou to bed this minute, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t give over laughing. What is there\r\nto laugh at, I should like to know? I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner cry nor laugh at the\r\nsight o\xe2\x80\x99 that poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s cap; and there\xe2\x80\x99s them as \xe2\x80\x99ud be better if\r\nthey could make theirselves like her i\xe2\x80\x99 more ways nor putting on her\r\ncap. It little becomes anybody i\xe2\x80\x99 this house to make fun o\xe2\x80\x99 my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild, an\xe2\x80\x99 her just gone away from us, as it went to my heart to part\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 her. An\xe2\x80\x99 I know one thing, as if trouble was to come, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was to\r\nbe laid up i\xe2\x80\x99 my bed, an\xe2\x80\x99 the children was to die\xe2\x80\x94as there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing\r\nbut what they will\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 the murrain was to come among the cattle again,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 everything went to rack an\xe2\x80\x99 ruin, I say we might be glad to get\r\nsight o\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s cap again, wi\xe2\x80\x99 her own face under it, border or no\r\nborder. For she\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 them things as looks the brightest on a rainy\r\nday, and loves you the best when you\xe2\x80\x99re most i\xe2\x80\x99 need on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, you perceive, was aware that nothing would be so likely to\r\nexpel the comic as the terrible. Tommy, who was of a susceptible\r\ndisposition, and very fond of his mother, and who had, besides, eaten\r\nso many cherries as to have his feelings less under command than usual,\r\nwas so affected by the dreadful picture she had made of the possible\r\nfuture that he began to cry; and the good-natured father, indulgent to\r\nall weaknesses but those of negligent farmers, said to Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter take the things off again, my lass; it hurts your aunt to see\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable\r\ndiversion; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap, which could\r\nnot be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser; and then followed a\r\ndiscussion on the secrets of good brewing, the folly of stinginess in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chopping,\xe2\x80\x9d and the doubtful economy of a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s making his own malt.\r\nMrs. Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with weight\r\non these subjects that by the time supper was ended, the ale-jug\r\nrefilled, and Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s pipe alight she was once more in high good\r\nhumour, and ready, at Adam\xe2\x80\x99s request, to fetch the broken\r\nspinning-wheel for his inspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking at it carefully, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a nice bit o\xe2\x80\x99 turning\r\nwanted. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty wheel. I must have it up at the turning-shop in\r\nthe village and do it there, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve no convenence for turning at\r\nhome. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll send it to Mr. Burge\xe2\x80\x99s shop i\xe2\x80\x99 the morning, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it\r\ndone for you by Wednesday. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been turning it over in my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, looking at Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cto make a bit more convenence at\r\nhome for nice jobs o\xe2\x80\x99 cabinet-making. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always done a deal at such\r\nlittle things in odd hours, and they\xe2\x80\x99re profitable, for there\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nworkmanship nor material in \xe2\x80\x99em. I look for me and Seth to get a little\r\nbusiness for ourselves i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull take as many things as we should make, besides what we could get\r\norders for round about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step\r\ntowards Adam\xe2\x80\x99s becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cmaster-man,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Poyser gave her\r\napprobation to the scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard, which was to\r\nbe capable of containing grocery, pickles, crockery, and house-linen in\r\nthe utmost compactness without confusion. Hetty, once more in her own\r\ndress, with her neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm\r\nevening, was seated picking currants near the window, where Adam could\r\nsee her quite well. And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up\r\nto go. He was pressed to come again soon, but not to stay longer, for\r\nat this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being\r\nsleepy at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take a step farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cand go on to see Mester\r\nMassey, for he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at church yesterday, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen him for a\r\nweek past. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never hardly known him to miss church before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve heared nothing about him, for it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nboys\xe2\x80\x99 hollodays now, so we can give you no account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll niver think o\xe2\x80\x99 going there at this hour o\xe2\x80\x99 the night?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Poyser, folding up her knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mester Massey sits up late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 the night-school\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot over yet. Some o\xe2\x80\x99 the men don\xe2\x80\x99t come till late\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve got so far\r\nto walk. And Bartle himself\xe2\x80\x99s never in bed till it\xe2\x80\x99s gone eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldna have him to live wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca-dropping candle-grease about, as you\xe2\x80\x99re like to tumble down o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfloor the first thing i\xe2\x80\x99 the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x99s late\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s late,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cI ne\xe2\x80\x99er sot\r\nup so i\xe2\x80\x99 _my_ life, not to say as it warna a marr\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99, or a\r\nchristenin\xe2\x80\x99, or a wake, or th\xe2\x80\x99 harvest supper. Eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x99s late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I sit up till after twelve often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t t\xe2\x80\x99 eat and drink extry, it\xe2\x80\x99s to work extry. Good-night, Mrs.\r\nPoyser; good-night, Hetty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty could only smile and not shake hands, for hers were dyed and damp\r\nwith currant-juice; but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large\r\npalm that was held out to them, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome again, come again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, think o\xe2\x80\x99 that now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, when Adam was out of on the\r\ncauseway. \xe2\x80\x9cSitting up till past twelve to do extry work! Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll not find\r\nmany men o\xe2\x80\x99 six-an\xe2\x80\x99 twenty as \xe2\x80\x99ull do to put i\xe2\x80\x99 the shafts wi\xe2\x80\x99 him. If\r\nyou can catch Adam for a husband, Hetty, you\xe2\x80\x99ll ride i\xe2\x80\x99 your own\r\nspring-cart some day, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants, so her uncle did\r\nnot see the little toss of the head with which she answered him. To\r\nride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\nThe Night-School and the Schoolmaster\r\n\r\n\r\nBartle Massey\xe2\x80\x99s was one of a few scattered houses on the edge of a\r\ncommon, which was divided by the road to Treddleston. Adam reached it\r\nin a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he had\r\nhis hand on the door-latch, he could see, through the curtainless\r\nwindow, that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks,\r\nlighted by thin dips.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered, a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey\r\nmerely nodded, leaving him to take his place where he pleased. He had\r\nnot come for the sake of a lesson to-night, and his mind was too full\r\nof personal matters, too full of the last two hours he had passed in\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s presence, for him to amuse himself with a book till school was\r\nover; so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind. It\r\nwas a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years; he\r\nknew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle\r\nMassey\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s head, by way of\r\nkeeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils; he knew the backs\r\nof all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above\r\nthe pegs for the slates; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out\r\nof the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters; he had\r\nlong ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think\r\nhow the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native\r\nelement; and from the place where he sat, he could make nothing of the\r\nold map of England that hung against the opposite wall, for age had\r\nturned it of a fine yellow brown, something like that of a\r\nwell-seasoned meerschaum. The drama that was going on was almost as\r\nfamiliar as the scene, nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent\r\nto it, and even in his present self-absorbed mood, Adam felt a\r\nmomentary stirring of the old fellow-feeling, as he looked at the rough\r\nmen painfully holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands, or humbly\r\nlabouring through their reading lesson.\r\n\r\nThe reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesk consisted of the three most backward pupils. Adam would have known\r\nit only by seeing Bartle Massey\xe2\x80\x99s face as he looked over his\r\nspectacles, which he had shifted to the ridge of his nose, not\r\nrequiring them for present purposes. The face wore its mildest\r\nexpression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute\r\nangle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth, habitually compressed\r\nwith a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a\r\nhelpful word or syllable in a moment. This gentle expression was the\r\nmore interesting because the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s nose, an irregular aquiline\r\ntwisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character; and\r\nhis brow, moreover, had that peculiar tension which always impresses\r\none as a sign of a keen impatient temperament: the blue veins stood out\r\nlike cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating\r\nbrow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly\r\nhair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close\r\nranks as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Bill, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d Bartle was saying in a kind tone, as he nodded to\r\nAdam, \xe2\x80\x9cbegin that again, and then perhaps, it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you what d-r-y\r\nspells. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same lesson you read last week, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill\xe2\x80\x9d was a sturdy fellow, aged four-and-twenty, an excellent\r\nstone-sawyer, who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of\r\nhis years; but he found a reading lesson in words of one syllable a\r\nharder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he had ever had to\r\nsaw. The letters, he complained, were so \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon alike, there was no\r\ntellin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em one from another,\xe2\x80\x9d the sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s business not being\r\nconcerned with minute differences such as exist between a letter with\r\nits tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down. But Bill had\r\na firm determination that he would learn to read, founded chiefly on\r\ntwo reasons: first, that Tom Hazelow, his cousin, could read anything\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cright off,\xe2\x80\x9d whether it was print or writing, and Tom had sent him a\r\nletter from twenty miles off, saying how he was prospering in the world\r\nand had got an overlooker\xe2\x80\x99s place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who\r\nsawed with him, had learned to read when he was turned twenty, and what\r\ncould be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered,\r\ncould be done by himself, seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay\r\nif circumstances required it. So here he was, pointing his big finger\r\ntowards three words at once, and turning his head on one side that he\r\nmight keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be\r\ndiscriminated out of the group. The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey\r\nmust possess was something so dim and vast that Bill\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\r\nrecoiled before it: he would hardly have ventured to deny that the\r\nschoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular\r\nreturn of daylight and the changes in the weather.\r\n\r\nThe man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he was a\r\nMethodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his life in\r\nperfect satisfaction with his ignorance, had lately \xe2\x80\x9cgot religion,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nalong with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him, too, learning\r\nwas a heavy business, and on his way out to-night he had offered as\r\nusual a special prayer for help, seeing that he had undertaken this\r\nhard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nmight have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish\r\nevil memories and the temptations of old habit\xe2\x80\x94or, in brief language,\r\nthe devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was\r\nsuspected, though there was no good evidence against him, of being the\r\nman who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that\r\nmight be, it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to,\r\nwhich was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist\r\npreacher at Treddleston, a great change had been observed in the\r\nbrickmaker; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his\r\nold sobriquet of \xe2\x80\x9cBrimstone,\xe2\x80\x9d there was nothing he held in so much\r\nhorror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element. He\r\nwas a broad-chested fellow with a fervid temperament, which helped him\r\nbetter in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring\r\nthe mere human knowledge of the alphabet. Indeed, he had been already a\r\nlittle shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist, who assured him\r\nthat the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a\r\nfear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up.\r\n\r\nThe third beginner was a much more promising pupil. He was a tall but\r\nthin and wiry man, nearly as old as Brimstone, with a very pale face\r\nand hands stained a deep blue. He was a dyer, who in the course of\r\ndipping homespun wool and old women\xe2\x80\x99s petticoats had got fired with the\r\nambition to learn a great deal more about the strange secrets of\r\ncolour. He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes,\r\nand he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the\r\nexpense of crimsons and scarlets. The druggist at Treddleston had given\r\nhim a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and\r\nexpense if he could learn to read, and so he had begun to give his\r\nspare hours to the night-school, resolving that his \xe2\x80\x9clittle chap\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshould lose no time in coming to Mr. Massey\xe2\x80\x99s day-school as soon as he\r\nwas old enough.\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see these three big men, with the marks of their\r\nhard labour about them, anxiously bending over the worn books and\r\npainfully making out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe grass is green,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe sticks are dry,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncorn is ripe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single\r\nwords all alike except in the first letter. It was almost as if three\r\nrough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become\r\nhuman. And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey\xe2\x80\x99s nature,\r\nfor such full-grown children as these were the only pupils for whom he\r\nhad no severe epithets and no impatient tones. He was not gifted with\r\nan imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that\r\npatience could never be an easy virtue to him; but this evening, as he\r\nglances over his spectacles at Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is turning\r\nhis head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the\r\nletters d-r-y, his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light.\r\n\r\nAfter the reading class, two youths between sixteen and nineteen came\r\nup with the imaginary bills of parcels, which they had been writing out\r\non their slates and were now required to calculate \xe2\x80\x9coff-hand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a test\r\nwhich they stood with such imperfect success that Bartle Massey, whose\r\neyes had been glaring at them ominously through his spectacles for some\r\nminutes, at length burst out in a bitter, high-pitched tone, pausing\r\nbetween every sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which\r\nrested between his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you see, you don\xe2\x80\x99t do this thing a bit better than you did a\r\nfortnight ago, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason. You want to learn\r\naccounts\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s well and good. But you think all you need do to learn\r\naccounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or so, two or three\r\ntimes a-week; and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of\r\ndoors again than you sweep the whole thing clean out of your mind. You\r\ngo whistling about, and take no more care what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of than\r\nif your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that\r\nhappened to be in the way; and if you get a good notion in \xe2\x80\x99em, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty soon washed out again. You think knowledge is to be got\r\ncheap\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nyou clever at figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t to be got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If you\xe2\x80\x99re to\r\nknow figures, you must turn \xe2\x80\x99em over in your heads and keep your\r\nthoughts fixed on \xe2\x80\x99em. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can\xe2\x80\x99t turn into a sum, for\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but what\xe2\x80\x99s got number in it\xe2\x80\x94even a fool. You may say to\r\nyourselves, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m one fool, and Jack\xe2\x80\x99s another; if my fool\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nweighed four pound, and Jack\xe2\x80\x99s three pound three ounces and three\r\nquarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nA man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for\r\nhimself and work \xe2\x80\x99em in his head. When he sat at his shoemaking, he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncount his stitches by fives, and then put a price on his stitches, say\r\nhalf a farthing, and then see how much money he could get in an hour;\r\nand then ask himself how much money he\xe2\x80\x99d get in a day at that rate; and\r\nthen how much ten workmen would get working three, or twenty, or a\r\nhundred years at that rate\xe2\x80\x94and all the while his needle would be going\r\njust as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in.\r\nBut the long and the short of it is\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll have nobody in my night-school\r\nthat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strive to learn what he comes to learn, as hard as if he\r\nwas striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nno man away because he\xe2\x80\x99s stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to\r\nlearn anything, I\xe2\x80\x99d not refuse to teach him. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll not throw away\r\ngood knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpenn\xe2\x80\x99orth,\r\nand carry it away with \xe2\x80\x99em as they would an ounce of snuff. So never\r\ncome to me again, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t show that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with your\r\nown heads, instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for\r\nyou. That\xe2\x80\x99s the last word I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this final sentence, Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever\r\nwith his knobbed stick, and the discomfited lads got up to go with a\r\nsulky look. The other pupils had happily only their writing-books to\r\nshow, in various stages of progress from pot-hooks to round text; and\r\nmere pen-strokes, however perverse, were less exasperating to Bartle\r\nthan false arithmetic. He was a little more severe than usual on Jacob\r\nStorey\xe2\x80\x99s Z\xe2\x80\x99s, of which poor Jacob had written a pageful, all with their\r\ntops turned the wrong way, with a puzzled sense that they were not\r\nright \xe2\x80\x9csomehow.\xe2\x80\x9d But he observed in apology, that it was a letter you\r\nnever wanted hardly, and he thought it had only been there \xe2\x80\x9cto finish\r\noff th\xe2\x80\x99 alphabet, like, though ampusand (&) would ha\xe2\x80\x99 done as well, for\r\nwhat he could see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-nights,\xe2\x80\x9d and Adam, knowing his old master\xe2\x80\x99s habits, rose and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cShall I put the candles out, Mr. Massey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy, yes, all but this, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry into the house; and\r\njust lock the outer door, now you\xe2\x80\x99re near it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, getting his\r\nstick in the fitting angle to help him in descending from his stool. He\r\nwas no sooner on the ground than it became obvious why the stick was\r\nnecessary\xe2\x80\x94the left leg was much shorter than the right. But the\r\nschool-master was so active with his lameness that it was hardly\r\nthought of as a misfortune; and if you had seen him make his way along\r\nthe schoolroom floor, and up the step into his kitchen, you would\r\nperhaps have understood why the naughty boys sometimes felt that his\r\npace might be indefinitely quickened and that he and his stick might\r\novertake them even in their swiftest run.\r\n\r\nThe moment he appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in his hand,\r\na faint whimpering began in the chimney-corner, and a\r\nbrown-and-tan-coloured bitch, of that wise-looking breed with short\r\nlegs and long body, known to an unmechanical generation as turnspits,\r\ncame creeping along the floor, wagging her tail, and hesitating at\r\nevery other step, as if her affections were painfully divided between\r\nthe hamper in the chimney-corner and the master, whom she could not\r\nleave without a greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Vixen, well then, how are the babbies?\xe2\x80\x9d said the schoolmaster,\r\nmaking haste towards the chimney-corner and holding the candle over the\r\nlow hamper, where two extremely blind puppies lifted up their heads\r\ntowards the light from a nest of flannel and wool. Vixen could not even\r\nsee her master look at them without painful excitement: she got into\r\nthe hamper and got out again the next moment, and behaved with true\r\nfeminine folly, though looking all the while as wise as a dwarf with a\r\nlarge old-fashioned head and body on the most abbreviated legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a family, I see, Mr. Massey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, smiling, as\r\nhe came into the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that? I thought it was against the law\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw? What\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 law when a man\xe2\x80\x99s once such a fool as to let a\r\nwoman into his house?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, turning away from the hamper with\r\nsome bitterness. He always called Vixen a woman, and seemed to have\r\nlost all consciousness that he was using a figure of speech. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nknown Vixen was a woman, I\xe2\x80\x99d never have held the boys from drowning\r\nher; but when I\xe2\x80\x99d got her into my hand, I was forced to take to her.\r\nAnd now you see what she\xe2\x80\x99s brought me to\xe2\x80\x94the sly, hypocritical\r\nwench\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Bartle spoke these last words in a rasping tone of reproach, and\r\nlooked at Vixen, who poked down her head and turned up her eyes towards\r\nhim with a keen sense of opprobrium\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand contrived to be brought to bed\r\non a Sunday at church-time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wished again and again I\xe2\x80\x99d been a\r\nbloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and the brats\r\nwith one cord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas afraid you must be ill for the first time i\xe2\x80\x99 your life. And I was\r\nparticularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my boy, I know why, I know why,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle kindly, going up to\r\nAdam and raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level\r\nwith his own head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a rough bit o\xe2\x80\x99 road to get over since I\r\nsaw you\xe2\x80\x94a rough bit o\xe2\x80\x99 road. But I\xe2\x80\x99m in hopes there are better times\r\ncoming for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some news to tell you. But I must get my\r\nsupper first, for I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry. Sit down, sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartel went into his little pantry, and brought out an excellent\r\nhome-baked loaf; for it was his one extravagance in these dear times to\r\neat bread once a-day instead of oat-cake; and he justified it by\r\nobserving, that what a schoolmaster wanted was brains, and oat-cake ran\r\ntoo much to bone instead of brains. Then came a piece of cheese and a\r\nquart jug with a crown of foam upon it. He placed them all on the round\r\ndeal table which stood against his large arm-chair in the\r\nchimney-corner, with Vixen\xe2\x80\x99s hamper on one side of it and a\r\nwindow-shelf with a few books piled up in it on the other. The table\r\nwas as clean as if Vixen had been an excellent housewife in a checkered\r\napron; so was the quarry floor; and the old carved oaken press, table,\r\nand chairs, which in these days would be bought at a high price in\r\naristocratic houses, though, in that period of spider-legs and inlaid\r\ncupids, Bartle had got them for an old song, were as free from dust as\r\nthings could be at the end of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. We\xe2\x80\x99ll not talk about business\r\ntill we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our supper. No man can be wise on an empty stomach.\r\nBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, rising from his chair again, \xe2\x80\x9cI must give Vixen her\r\nsupper too, confound her! Though she\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing with it but nourish\r\nthose unnecessary babbies. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way with these women\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nno head-pieces to nourish, and so their food all runs either to fat or\r\nto brats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at once\r\nfixed her eyes on, and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the\r\nutmost dispatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had my supper, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cso I\xe2\x80\x99ll look on while you\r\neat yours. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the Hall Farm, and they always have their\r\nsupper betimes, you know: they don\xe2\x80\x99t keep your late hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know little about their hours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle dryly, cutting his bread\r\nand not shrinking from the crust. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a house I seldom go into,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of the boys, and Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo many women in the house for me: I hate the sound of women\xe2\x80\x99s voices;\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re always either a-buzz or a-squeak\xe2\x80\x94always either a-buzz or\r\na-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top o\xe2\x80\x99 the talk like a fife; and as\r\nfor the young lasses, I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon look at water-grubs. I know what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to\xe2\x80\x94stinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my\r\nboy: it\xe2\x80\x99s been drawn for you\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s been drawn for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, who took his old friend\xe2\x80\x99s whim more\r\nseriously than usual to-night, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on the creaturs God\r\nhas made to be companions for us. A working-man \xe2\x80\x99ud be badly off\r\nwithout a wife to see to th\xe2\x80\x99 house and the victual, and make things\r\nclean and comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! It\xe2\x80\x99s the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed,\r\nto say a woman makes a house comfortable. It\xe2\x80\x99s a story got up because\r\nthe women are there and something must be found for \xe2\x80\x99em to do. I tell\r\nyou there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing under the sun that needs to be done at all, but\r\nwhat a man can do better than a woman, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s bearing children,\r\nand they do that in a poor make-shift way; it had better ha\xe2\x80\x99 been left\r\nto the men\xe2\x80\x94it had better ha\xe2\x80\x99 been left to the men. I tell you, a woman\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come to see that\r\nthe hotter th\xe2\x80\x99 oven the shorter the time. I tell you, a woman \xe2\x80\x99ull make\r\nyour porridge every day for twenty years and never think of measuring\r\nthe proportion between the meal and the milk\xe2\x80\x94a little more or less,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll think, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t signify. The porridge _will_ be awk\xe2\x80\x99ard now and\r\nthen: if it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s summat in the meal, or it\xe2\x80\x99s summat in the\r\nmilk, or it\xe2\x80\x99s summat in the water. Look at me! I make my own bread, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no difference between one batch and another from year\xe2\x80\x99s end to\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s end; but if I\xe2\x80\x99d got any other woman besides Vixen in the house,\r\nI must pray to the Lord every baking to give me patience if the bread\r\nturned out heavy. And as for cleanliness, my house is cleaner than any\r\nother house on the Common, though the half of \xe2\x80\x99em swarm with women.\r\nWill Baker\xe2\x80\x99s lad comes to help me in a morning, and we get as much\r\ncleaning done in one hour, without any fuss, as a woman \xe2\x80\x99ud get done in\r\nthree, and all the while be sending buckets o\xe2\x80\x99 water after your ankles,\r\nand let the fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle o\xe2\x80\x99 the floor\r\nhalf the day for you to break your shins against \xe2\x80\x99em. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me\r\nabout God having made such creatures to be companions for us! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay but He might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in Paradise\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas no cooking to be spoilt there, and no other woman to cackle with\r\nand make mischief, though you see what mischief she did as soon as\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d an opportunity. But it\xe2\x80\x99s an impious, unscriptural opinion to say\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s a blessing to a man now; you might as well say adders and\r\nwasps, and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing, when they\xe2\x80\x99re only the\r\nevils that belong to this state o\xe2\x80\x99 probation, which it\xe2\x80\x99s lawful for a\r\nman to keep as clear of as he can in this life, hoping to get quit of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em for ever in another\xe2\x80\x94hoping to get quit of \xe2\x80\x99em for ever in another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective\r\nthat he had forgotten his supper, and only used the knife for the\r\npurpose of rapping the table with the haft. But towards the close, the\r\nraps became so sharp and frequent, and his voice so quarrelsome, that\r\nVixen felt it incumbent on her to jump out of the hamper and bark\r\nvaguely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, Vixen!\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Bartle, turning round upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like\r\nthe rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the women\xe2\x80\x94always putting in _your_ word before you know\r\nwhy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation, and her master\r\ncontinued his supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to\r\ninterrupt; he knew the old man would be in a better humour when he had\r\nhad his supper and lighted his pipe. Adam was used to hear him talk in\r\nthis way, but had never learned so much of Bartle\xe2\x80\x99s past life as to\r\nknow whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience. On\r\nthat point Bartle was mute, and it was even a secret where he had lived\r\nprevious to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and\r\nartisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their\r\nonly schoolmaster. If anything like a question was ventured on this\r\nsubject, Bartle always replied, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many places\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a\r\ndeal in the south,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of\r\nasking for a particular town or village in Africa as in \xe2\x80\x9cthe south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, at last, when he had poured out his\r\nsecond mug of ale and lighted his pipe, \xe2\x80\x9cnow then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little\r\ntalk. But tell me first, have you heard any particular news to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cnot as I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it close, they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it close, I daresay. But I\r\nfound it out by chance; and it\xe2\x80\x99s news that may concern you, Adam, else\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a man that don\xe2\x80\x99t know a superficial square foot from a solid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs, looking earnestly\r\nthe while at Adam. Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion\r\nof keeping his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs; he is always\r\nletting it go nearly out, and then punishing it for that negligence. At\r\nlast he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSatchell\xe2\x80\x99s got a paralytic stroke. I found it out from\r\nthe lad they sent to Treddleston for the doctor, before seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nthis morning. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good way beyond sixty, you know; it\xe2\x80\x99s much if he\r\ngets over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay there\xe2\x80\x99d be more rejoicing than sorrow in\r\nthe parish at his being laid up. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a selfish, tale-bearing,\r\nmischievous fellow; but, after all, there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody he\xe2\x80\x99s done so much\r\nharm to as to th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s the squire himself as is to\r\nblame\xe2\x80\x94making a stupid fellow like that a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man-of-all-work, just\r\nto save th\xe2\x80\x99 expense of having a proper steward to look after th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nestate. And he\xe2\x80\x99s lost more by ill management o\xe2\x80\x99 the woods, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound, than \xe2\x80\x99ud pay for two stewards. If he\xe2\x80\x99s laid on the shelf, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be hoped he\xe2\x80\x99ll make way for a better man, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike to make any difference to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I see it, but I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, \xe2\x80\x9cand others besides me. The\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s coming of age now\xe2\x80\x94you know that as well as I do\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbe expected he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little more voice in things. And I know, and\r\nyou know too, what \xe2\x80\x99ud be the captain\xe2\x80\x99s wish about the woods, if there\r\nwas a fair opportunity for making a change. He\xe2\x80\x99s said in plenty of\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s hearing that he\xe2\x80\x99d make you manager of the woods to-morrow, if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d the power. Why, Carroll, Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s butler, heard him say so to\r\nthe parson not many days ago. Carroll looked in when we were smoking\r\nour pipes o\xe2\x80\x99 Saturday night at Casson\xe2\x80\x99s, and he told us about it; and\r\nwhenever anybody says a good word for you, the parson\xe2\x80\x99s ready to back\r\nit, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for. It was pretty well talked over, I can tell\r\nyou, at Casson\xe2\x80\x99s, and one and another had their fling at you; for if\r\ndonkeys set to work to sing, you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty sure what the tune\xe2\x80\x99ll be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, did they talk it over before Mr. Burge?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nthere o\xe2\x80\x99 Saturday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he went away before Carroll came; and Casson\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s always for\r\nsetting other folks right, you know\xe2\x80\x94would have it Burge was the man to\r\nhave the management of the woods. \xe2\x80\x98A substantial man,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98with\r\npretty near sixty years\xe2\x80\x99 experience o\xe2\x80\x99 timber: it \xe2\x80\x99ud be all very well\r\nfor Adam Bede to act under him, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be supposed the squire\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud appoint a young fellow like Adam, when there\xe2\x80\x99s his elders and\r\nbetters at hand!\xe2\x80\x99 But I said, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty notion o\xe2\x80\x99 yours, Casson.\r\nWhy, Burge is the man to _buy_ timber; would you put the woods into his\r\nhands and let him make his own bargains? I think you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave your\r\ncustomers to score their own drink, do you? And as for age, what that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth depends on the quality o\xe2\x80\x99 the liquor. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well known\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s the backbone of Jonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for your good word, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, for all\r\nthat, Casson was partly i\xe2\x80\x99 the right for once. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much\r\nlikelihood that th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire \xe2\x80\x99ud ever consent t\xe2\x80\x99 employ me. I\r\noffended him about two years ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s never forgiven me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how was that? You never told me about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 nonsense. I\xe2\x80\x99d made a frame for a screen for Miss\r\nLyddy\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s allays making something with her worsted-work, you know\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d given me particular orders about this screen, and there was as\r\nmuch talking and measuring as if we\xe2\x80\x99d been planning a house. However,\r\nit was a nice bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work, and I liked doing it for her. But, you know,\r\nthose little friggling things take a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 time. I only worked at it\r\nin overhours\xe2\x80\x94often late at night\xe2\x80\x94and I had to go to Treddleston over\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 over again about little bits o\xe2\x80\x99 brass nails and such gear; and I\r\nturned the little knobs and the legs, and carved th\xe2\x80\x99 open work, after a\r\npattern, as nice as could be. And I was uncommon pleased with it when\r\nit was done. And when I took it home, Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring\r\nit into her drawing-room, so as she might give me directions about\r\nfastening on the work\xe2\x80\x94very fine needlework, Jacob and Rachel a-kissing\r\none another among the sheep, like a picture\xe2\x80\x94and th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire was\r\nsitting there, for he mostly sits with her. Well, she was mighty\r\npleased with the screen, and then she wanted to know what pay she was\r\nto give me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak at random\xe2\x80\x94you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not my way; I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncalculated pretty close, though I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made out a bill, and I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One pound thirteen.\xe2\x80\x99 That was paying for the mater\xe2\x80\x99als and paying me,\r\nbut none too much, for my work. Th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire looked up at this, and\r\npeered in his way at the screen, and said, \xe2\x80\x98One pound thirteen for a\r\ngimcrack like that! Lydia, my dear, if you must spend money on these\r\nthings, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get them at Rosseter, instead of paying double\r\nprice for clumsy work here? Such things are not work for a carpenter\r\nlike Adam. Give him a guinea, and no more.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, Miss Lyddy, I reckon,\r\nbelieved what he told her, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not overfond o\xe2\x80\x99 parting with the\r\nmoney herself\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad woman at bottom, but she\xe2\x80\x99s been brought\r\nup under his thumb; so she began fidgeting with her purse, and turned\r\nas red as her ribbon. But I made a bow, and said, \xe2\x80\x98No, thank you,\r\nmadam; I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a present o\xe2\x80\x99 the screen, if you please. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncharged the regular price for my work, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s done well; and I\r\nknow, begging His Honour\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get such a screen\r\nat Rosseter under two guineas. I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give you my work\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen done in my own time, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s got anything to do with it but\r\nme; but if I\xe2\x80\x99m paid, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take a smaller price than I asked, because\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99ud be like saying I\xe2\x80\x99d asked more than was just. With your leave,\r\nmadam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bid you good-morning.\xe2\x80\x99 I made my bow and went out before\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d time to say any more, for she stood with the purse in her hand,\r\nlooking almost foolish. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be disrespectful, and I spoke\r\nas polite as I could; but I can give in to no man, if he wants to make\r\nit out as I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to overreach him. And in the evening the footman\r\nbrought me the one pound thirteen wrapped in paper. But since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen pretty clear as th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire can\xe2\x80\x99t abide me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough, that\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle meditatively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way to bring him round would be to show him what was for his\r\nown interest, and that the captain may do\xe2\x80\x94that the captain may do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cthe squire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cute enough but it takes\r\nsomething else besides \xe2\x80\x99cuteness to make folks see what\xe2\x80\x99ll be their\r\ninterest in the long run. It takes some conscience and belief in right\r\nand wrong, I see that pretty clear. You\xe2\x80\x99d hardly ever bring round th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nold squire to believe he\xe2\x80\x99d gain as much in a straightfor\xe2\x80\x99ard way as by\r\ntricks and turns. And, besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not much mind to work under him: I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to quarrel with any gentleman, more particular an old\r\ngentleman turned eighty, and I know we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree long. If the\r\ncaptain was master o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 estate, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be different: he\xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\nconscience and a will to do right, and I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner work for him nor for\r\nany man living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my boy, if good luck knocks at your door, don\xe2\x80\x99t you put\r\nyour head out at window and tell it to be gone about its business,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. You must learn to deal with odd and even in life, as well\r\nas in figures. I tell you now, as I told you ten years ago, when you\r\npommelled young Mike Holdsworth for wanting to pass a bad shilling\r\nbefore you knew whether he was in jest or earnest\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re overhasty and\r\nproud, and apt to set your teeth against folks that don\xe2\x80\x99t square to\r\nyour notions. It\xe2\x80\x99s no harm for me to be a bit fiery and\r\nstiff-backed\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m an old schoolmaster, and shall never want to get on to\r\na higher perch. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the use of all the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in\r\nteaching you writing and mapping and mensuration, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not to get\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99ard in the world and show folks there\xe2\x80\x99s some advantage in having a\r\nhead on your shoulders, instead of a turnip? Do you mean to go on\r\nturning up your nose at every opportunity because it\xe2\x80\x99s got a bit of a\r\nsmell about it that nobody finds out but yourself? It\xe2\x80\x99s as foolish as\r\nthat notion o\xe2\x80\x99 yours that a wife is to make a working-man comfortable.\r\nStuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense! Leave that to fools that never\r\ngot beyond a sum in simple addition. Simple addition enough! Add one\r\nfool to another fool, and in six years\xe2\x80\x99 time six fools more\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nof the same denomination, big and little\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with the sum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the\r\npipe had gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking\r\na light furiously, after which he puffed with fierce resolution, fixing\r\nhis eye still on Adam, who was trying not to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal o\xe2\x80\x99 sense in what you say, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam began,\r\nas soon as he felt quite serious, \xe2\x80\x9cas there always is. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nin that it\xe2\x80\x99s no business o\xe2\x80\x99 mine to be building on chances that may\r\nnever happen. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do is to work as well as I can with the\r\ntools and mater\xe2\x80\x99als I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in my hands. If a good chance comes to me,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll think o\xe2\x80\x99 what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying; but till then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\r\nto do but to trust to my own hands and my own head-piece. I\xe2\x80\x99m turning\r\nover a little plan for Seth and me to go into the cabinet-making a bit\r\nby ourselves, and win a extra pound or two in that way. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting late now\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty near eleven before I\xe2\x80\x99m at home, and\r\nMother may happen to lie awake; she\xe2\x80\x99s more fidgety nor usual now. So\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll bid you good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the gate with you\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine night,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBartle, taking up his stick. Vixen was at once on her legs, and without\r\nfurther words the three walked out into the starlight, by the side of\r\nBartle\xe2\x80\x99s potato-beds, to the little gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the music o\xe2\x80\x99 Friday night, if you can, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nman, as he closed the gate after Adam and leaned against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, striding along towards the streak of pale road.\r\nHe was the only object moving on the wide common. The two grey donkeys,\r\njust visible in front of the gorse bushes, stood as still as limestone\r\nimages\xe2\x80\x94as still as the grey-thatched roof of the mud cottage a little\r\nfarther on. Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed\r\ninto the darkness, while Vixen, in a state of divided affection, had\r\ntwice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her\r\npuppies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the schoolmaster, as Adam disappeared, \xe2\x80\x9cthere you\r\ngo, stalking along\xe2\x80\x94stalking along; but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been what you\r\nare if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a bit of old lame Bartle inside you. The\r\nstrongest calf must have something to suck at. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of these\r\nbig, lumbering fellows \xe2\x80\x99ud never have known their A B C if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for Bartle Massey. Well, well, Vixen, you foolish wench, what is\r\nit, what is it? I must go in, must I? Aye, aye, I\xe2\x80\x99m never to have a\r\nwill o\xe2\x80\x99 my own any more. And those pups\xe2\x80\x94what do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m to do\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em, when they\xe2\x80\x99re twice as big as you? For I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure the\r\nfather was that hulking bull-terrier of Will Baker\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he now, eh,\r\nyou sly hussy?\xe2\x80\x9d(Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran\r\nforward into the house. Subjects are sometimes broached which a\r\nwell-bred female will ignore.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking to a woman with babbies?\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nBartle. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got no conscience\xe2\x80\x94no conscience; it\xe2\x80\x99s all run to milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Third\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\nGoing to the Birthday Feast\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth of July was come, and it was one of those half-dozen warm\r\ndays which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer. No\r\nrain had fallen for the last three or four days, and the weather was\r\nperfect for that time of the year: there was less dust than usual on\r\nthe dark-green hedge-rows and on the wild camomile that starred the\r\nroadside, yet the grass was dry enough for the little children to roll\r\non it, and there was no cloud but a long dash of light, downy ripple,\r\nhigh, high up in the far-off blue sky. Perfect weather for an outdoor\r\nJuly merry-making, yet surely not the best time of year to be born in.\r\nNature seems to make a hot pause just then: all the loveliest flowers\r\nare gone; the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past; and\r\nyet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come, and we tremble at\r\nthe possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in the moment of\r\nits ripeness. The woods are all one dark monotonous green; the\r\nwaggon-loads of hay no longer creep along the lanes, scattering their\r\nsweet-smelling fragments on the blackberry branches; the pastures are\r\noften a little tanned, yet the corn has not got its last splendour of\r\nred and gold; the lambs and calves have lost all traces of their\r\ninnocent frisky prettiness, and have become stupid young sheep and\r\ncows. But it is a time of leisure on the farm\xe2\x80\x94that pause between\r\nhay-and corn-harvest, and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and\r\nBroxton thought the captain did well to come of age just then, when\r\nthey could give their undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask\r\nof ale which had been brewed the autumn after \xe2\x80\x9cthe heir\xe2\x80\x9d was born, and\r\nwas to be tapped on his twenty-first birthday. The air had been merry\r\nwith the ringing of church-bells very early this morning, and every one\r\nhad made haste to get through the needful work before twelve, when it\r\nwould be time to think of getting ready to go to the Chase.\r\n\r\nThe midday sun was streaming into Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s bedchamber, and there was no\r\nblind to temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked\r\nat herself in the old specked glass. Still, that was the only glass she\r\nhad in which she could see her neck and arms, for the small hanging\r\nglass she had fetched out of the next room\xe2\x80\x94the room that had been\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94would show her nothing below her little chin; and that\r\nbeautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek melted into\r\nanother roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls. And to-day she\r\nthought more than usual about her neck and arms; for at the dance this\r\nevening she was not to wear any neckerchief, and she had been busy\r\nyesterday with her spotted pink-and-white frock, that she might make\r\nthe sleeves either long or short at will. She was dressed now just as\r\nshe was to be in the evening, with a tucker made of \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d lace, which\r\nher aunt had lent her for this unparalleled occasion, but with no\r\nornaments besides; she had even taken out her small round ear-rings\r\nwhich she wore every day. But there was something more to be done,\r\napparently, before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves, which\r\nshe was to wear in the day-time, for now she unlocked the drawer that\r\nheld her private treasures. It is more than a month since we saw her\r\nunlock that drawer before, and now it holds new treasures, so much more\r\nprecious than the old ones that these are thrust into the corner. Hetty\r\nwould not care to put the large coloured glass ear-rings into her ears\r\nnow; for see! she has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and\r\ngarnet, lying snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin. Oh,\r\nthe delight of taking out that little box and looking at the ear-rings!\r\nDo not reason about it, my philosphical reader, and say that Hetty,\r\nbeing very pretty, must have known that it did not signify whether she\r\nhad on any ornaments or not; and that, moreover, to look at ear-rings\r\nwhich she could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a\r\nsatisfaction, the essence of vanity being a reference to the\r\nimpressions produced on others; you will never understand women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnatures if you are so excessively rational. Try rather to divest\r\nyourself of all your rational prejudices, as much as if you were\r\nstudying the psychology of a canary bird, and only watch the movements\r\nof this pretty round creature as she turns her head on one side with an\r\nunconscious smile at the ear-rings nestled in the little box. Ah, you\r\nthink, it is for the sake of the person who has given them to her, and\r\nher thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into\r\nher hands. No; else why should she have cared to have ear-rings rather\r\nthan anything else? And I know that she had longed for ear-rings from\r\namong all the ornaments she could imagine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle, little ears!\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur had said, pretending to pinch them one\r\nevening, as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\nI had some pretty ear-rings!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a moment, almost before she\r\nknew what she was saying\xe2\x80\x94the wish lay so close to her lips, it _would_\r\nflutter past them at the slightest breath. And the next day\xe2\x80\x94it was only\r\nlast week\xe2\x80\x94Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them.\r\nThat little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of\r\nchildishness; he had never heard anything like it before; and he had\r\nwrapped the box up in a great many covers, that he might see Hetty\r\nunwrapping it with growing curiosity, till at last her eyes flashed\r\nback their new delight into his.\r\n\r\nNo, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the\r\near-rings, for now she is taking them out of the box, not to press them\r\nto her lips, but to fasten them in her ears\xe2\x80\x94only for one moment, to see\r\nhow pretty they look, as she peeps at them in the glass against the\r\nwall, with first one position of the head and then another, like a\r\nlistening bird. It is impossible to be wise on the subject of ear-rings\r\nas one looks at her; what should those delicate pearls and crystals be\r\nmade for, if not for such ears? One cannot even find fault with the\r\ntiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out; perhaps\r\nwater-nixies, and such lovely things without souls, have these little\r\nround holes in their ears by nature, ready to hang jewels in. And Hetty\r\nmust be one of them: it is too painful to think that she is a woman,\r\nwith a woman\xe2\x80\x99s destiny before her\xe2\x80\x94a woman spinning in young ignorance a\r\nlight web of folly and vain hopes which may one day close round her and\r\npress upon her, a rancorous poisoned garment, changing all at once her\r\nfluttering, trivial butterfly sensations into a life of deep human\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nBut she cannot keep in the ear-rings long, else she may make her uncle\r\nand aunt wait. She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them\r\nup. Some day she will be able to wear any ear-rings she likes, and\r\nalready she lives in an invisible world of brilliant costumes,\r\nshimmering gauze, soft satin, and velvet, such as the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid at\r\nthe Chase has shown her in Miss Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe. She feels the\r\nbracelets on her arms, and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall\r\nmirror. But she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to\r\nwear to-day, because she can hang it on the chain of dark-brown berries\r\nwhich she has been used to wear on grand days, with a tiny flat\r\nscent-bottle at the end of it tucked inside her frock; and she _must_\r\nput on her brown berries\xe2\x80\x94her neck would look so unfinished without it.\r\nHetty was not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear-rings, though\r\nit was a handsome large locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and\r\na beautiful gold border round the glass, which showed a light-brown\r\nslightly waving lock, forming a background for two little dark rings.\r\nShe must keep it under her clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty\r\nhad another passion, only a little less strong than her love of finery,\r\nand that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in\r\nher bosom. She would always have worn it, if she had dared to encounter\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s questions about a ribbon round her neck. So now she slipped\r\nit on along her chain of dark-brown berries, and snapped the chain\r\nround her neck. It was not a very long chain, only allowing the locket\r\nto hang a little way below the edge of her frock. And now she had\r\nnothing to do but to put on her long sleeves, her new white gauze\r\nneckerchief, and her straw hat trimmed with white to-day instead of the\r\npink, which had become rather faded under the July sun. That hat made\r\nthe drop of bitterness in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s cup to-day, for it was not quite\r\nnew\xe2\x80\x94everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white\r\nribbon\xe2\x80\x94and Mary Burge, she felt sure, would have a new hat or bonnet\r\non. She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings: they\r\nreally were very nice indeed, and she had given almost all her spare\r\nmoney for them. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s dream of the future could not make her\r\ninsensible to triumph in the present. To be sure, Captain Donnithorne\r\nloved her so that he would never care about looking at other people,\r\nbut then those other people didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he loved her, and she was\r\nnot satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for\r\na short space.\r\n\r\nThe whole party was assembled in the house-place when Hetty went down,\r\nall of course in their Sunday clothes; and the bells had been ringing\r\nso this morning in honour of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s twenty-first birthday, and\r\nthe work had all been got done so early, that Marty and Tommy were not\r\nquite easy in their minds until their mother had assured them that\r\ngoing to church was not part of the day\xe2\x80\x99s festivities. Mr. Poyser had\r\nonce suggested that the house should be shut up and left to take care\r\nof itself; \xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no danger of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s breaking\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94everybody\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the Chase, thieves an\xe2\x80\x99 all. If we lock th\xe2\x80\x99 house\r\nup, all the men can go: it\xe2\x80\x99s a day they wonna see twice i\xe2\x80\x99 their\r\nlives.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mrs. Poyser answered with great decision: \xe2\x80\x9cI never left the\r\nhouse to take care of itself since I was a missis, and I never will.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s been ill-looking tramps enoo\xe2\x80\x99 about the place this last week,\r\nto carry off every ham an\xe2\x80\x99 every spoon we\xe2\x80\x99n got; and they all collogue\r\ntogether, them tramps, as it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy they hanna come and poisoned the\r\ndogs and murdered us all in our beds afore we knowed, some Friday night\r\nwhen we\xe2\x80\x99n got the money in th\xe2\x80\x99 house to pay the men. And it\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nenough the tramps know where we\xe2\x80\x99re going as well as we do oursens; for\r\nif Old Harry wants any work done, you may be sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll find the\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense about murdering us in our beds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\ngun i\xe2\x80\x99 our room, hanna I? and thee\xe2\x80\x99st got ears as \xe2\x80\x99ud find it out if a\r\nmouse was gnawing the bacon. Howiver, if thee wouldstna be easy, Alick\r\ncan stay at home i\xe2\x80\x99 the forepart o\xe2\x80\x99 the day, and Tim can come back\r\ntow\xe2\x80\x99rds five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and let Alick have his turn. They may let Growler\r\nloose if anybody offers to do mischief, and there\xe2\x80\x99s Alick\xe2\x80\x99s dog too,\r\nready enough to set his tooth in a tramp if Alick gives him a wink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser accepted this compromise, but thought it advisable to bar\r\nand bolt to the utmost; and now, at the last moment before starting,\r\nNancy, the dairy-maid, was closing the shutters of the house-place,\r\nalthough the window, lying under the immediate observation of Alick and\r\nthe dogs, might have been supposed the least likely to be selected for\r\na burglarious attempt.\r\n\r\nThe covered cart, without springs, was standing ready to carry the\r\nwhole family except the men-servants. Mr. Poyser and the grandfather\r\nsat on the seat in front, and within there was room for all the women\r\nand children; the fuller the cart the better, because then the jolting\r\nwould not hurt so much, and Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s broad person and thick arms were an\r\nexcellent cushion to be pitched on. But Mr. Poyser drove at no more\r\nthan a walking pace, that there might be as little risk of jolting as\r\npossible on this warm day, and there was time to exchange greetings and\r\nremarks with the foot-passengers who were going the same way, specking\r\nthe paths between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with bits\r\nof movable bright colour\xe2\x80\x94a scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies that\r\nnodded a little too thickly among the corn, or a dark-blue neckerchief\r\nwith ends flaunting across a brand-new white smock-frock. All Broxton\r\nand all Hayslope were to be at the Chase, and make merry there in\r\nhonour of \xe2\x80\x9cth\xe2\x80\x99 heir\xe2\x80\x9d; and the old men and women, who had never been so\r\nfar down this side of the hill for the last twenty years, were being\r\nbrought from Broxton and Hayslope in one of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s waggons, at\r\nMr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. The church-bells had struck up again now\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlast tune, before the ringers came down the hill to have their share in\r\nthe festival; and before the bells had finished, other music was heard\r\napproaching, so that even Old Brown, the sober horse that was drawing\r\nMr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s cart, began to prick up his ears. It was the band of the\r\nBenefit Club, which had mustered in all its glory\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, in\r\nbright-blue scarfs and blue favours, and carrying its banner with the\r\nmotto, \xe2\x80\x9cLet brotherly love continue,\xe2\x80\x9d encircling a picture of a\r\nstone-pit.\r\n\r\nThe carts, of course, were not to enter the Chase. Every one must get\r\ndown at the lodges, and the vehicles must be sent back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Chase is like a fair a\xe2\x80\x99ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, as she got\r\ndown from the cart, and saw the groups scattered under the great oaks,\r\nand the boys running about in the hot sunshine to survey the tall poles\r\nsurmounted by the fluttering garments that were to be the prize of the\r\nsuccessful climbers. \xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought there wasna so many people\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the two parishes. Mercy on us! How hot it is out o\xe2\x80\x99 the shade! Come\r\nhere, Totty, else your little face \xe2\x80\x99ull be burnt to a scratchin\xe2\x80\x99! They\r\nmight ha\xe2\x80\x99 cooked the dinners i\xe2\x80\x99 that open space an\xe2\x80\x99 saved the fires. I\r\nshall go to Mrs. Best\xe2\x80\x99s room an\xe2\x80\x99 sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, stop a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 waggin coming\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 old folks in\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99ll be such a sight as wonna come o\xe2\x80\x99er again,\r\nto see \xe2\x80\x99em get down an\xe2\x80\x99 walk along all together. You remember some on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em i\xe2\x80\x99 their prime, eh, Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Martin, walking slowly under the shade of the\r\nlodge porch, from which he could see the aged party descend. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nremember Jacob Taft walking fifty mile after the Scotch raybels, when\r\nthey turned back from Stoniton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt himself quite a youngster, with a long life before him, as he\r\nsaw the Hayslope patriarch, old Feyther Taft, descend from the waggon\r\nand walk towards him, in his brown nightcap, and leaning on his two\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mester Taft,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted old Martin, at the utmost stretch of his\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94for though he knew the old man was stone deaf, he could not omit\r\nthe propriety of a greeting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re hearty yet. You can enjoy yoursen\r\nto-day, for-all you\xe2\x80\x99re ninety an\xe2\x80\x99 better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sarvant, mesters, your sarvant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Feyther Taft in a treble\r\ntone, perceiving that he was in company.\r\n\r\nThe aged group, under care of sons or daughters, themselves worn and\r\ngrey, passed on along the least-winding carriage-road towards the\r\nhouse, where a special table was prepared for them; while the Poyser\r\nparty wisely struck across the grass under the shade of the great\r\ntrees, but not out of view of the house-front, with its sloping lawn\r\nand flower-beds, or of the pretty striped marquee at the edge of the\r\nlawn, standing at right angles with two larger marquees on each side of\r\nthe open green space where the games were to be played. The house would\r\nhave been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen Anne\xe2\x80\x99s time, but\r\nfor the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one end, in\r\nmuch the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high\r\nand prim at the end of older and lower farm-offices. The fine old\r\nremnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches,\r\nbut the sun was now on the taller and more advanced front, the blinds\r\nwere all down, and the house seemed asleep in the hot midday. It made\r\nHetty quite sad to look at it: Arthur must be somewhere in the back\r\nrooms, with the grand company, where he could not possibly know that\r\nshe was come, and she should not see him for a long, long while\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ntill after dinner, when they said he was to come up and make a speech.\r\n\r\nBut Hetty was wrong in part of her conjecture. No grand company was\r\ncome except the Irwines, for whom the carriage had been sent early, and\r\nArthur was at that moment not in a back room, but walking with the\r\nrector into the broad stone cloisters of the old abbey, where the long\r\ntables were laid for all the cottage tenants and the farm-servants. A\r\nvery handsome young Briton he looked to-day, in high spirits and a\r\nbright-blue frock-coat, the highest mode\xe2\x80\x94his arm no longer in a sling.\r\nSo open-looking and candid, too; but candid people have their secrets,\r\nand secrets leave no lines in young faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they entered the cool cloisters, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nthe cottagers have the best of it: these cloisters make a delightful\r\ndining-room on a hot day. That was capital advice of yours, Irwine,\r\nabout the dinners\xe2\x80\x94to let them be as orderly and comfortable as\r\npossible, and only for the tenants: especially as I had only a limited\r\nsum after all; for though my grandfather talked of a _carte blanche_,\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make up his mind to trust me, when it came to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll give more pleasure in this quiet way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nIrwine. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this sort of thing people are constantly confounding\r\nliberality with riot and disorder. It sounds very grand to say that so\r\nmany sheep and oxen were roasted whole, and everybody ate who liked to\r\ncome; but in the end it generally happens that no one has had an\r\nenjoyable meal. If the people get a good dinner and a moderate quantity\r\nof ale in the middle of the day, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to enjoy the games as\r\nthe day cools. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hinder some of them from getting too much\r\ntowards evening, but drunkenness and darkness go better together than\r\ndrunkenness and daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope there won\xe2\x80\x99t be much of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept the Treddleston\r\npeople away by having a feast for them in the town; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Casson\r\nand Adam Bede and some other good fellows to look to the giving out of\r\nale in the booths, and to take care things don\xe2\x80\x99t go too far. Come, let\r\nus go up above now and see the dinner-tables for the large tenants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery\r\nabove the cloisters, a gallery where all the dusty worthless old\r\npictures had been banished for the last three generations\xe2\x80\x94mouldy\r\nportraits of Queen Elizabeth and her ladies, General Monk with his eye\r\nknocked out, Daniel very much in the dark among the lions, and Julius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar on horseback, with a high nose and laurel crown, holding his\r\nCommentaries in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old\r\nabbey!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m ever master here, I shall do up the\r\ngallery in first-rate style. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got no room in the house a third as\r\nlarge as this. That second table is for the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives and\r\nchildren: Mrs. Best said it would be more comfortable for the mothers\r\nand children to be by themselves. I was determined to have the\r\nchildren, and make a regular family thing of it. I shall be \xe2\x80\x98the old\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99 to those little lads and lasses some day, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\ntheir children what a much finer young fellow I was than my own son.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a table for the women and children below as well. But you will\r\nsee them all\xe2\x80\x94you will come up with me after dinner, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss your maiden speech\r\nto the tenantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there will be something else you\xe2\x80\x99ll like to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go into the library and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it while my\r\ngrandfather is in the drawing-room with the ladies. Something that will\r\nsurprise you,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as they sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cMy grandfather has come\r\nround after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, about Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I should have ridden over to tell you about it, only I was so\r\nbusy. You know I told you I had quite given up arguing the matter with\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94I thought it was hopeless\xe2\x80\x94but yesterday morning he asked me to come\r\nin here to him before I went out, and astonished me by saying that he\r\nhad decided on all the new arrangements he should make in consequence\r\nof old Satchell being obliged to lay by work, and that he intended to\r\nemploy Adam in superintending the woods at a salary of a guinea a-week,\r\nand the use of a pony to be kept here. I believe the secret of it is,\r\nhe saw from the first it would be a profitable plan, but he had some\r\nparticular dislike of Adam to get over\xe2\x80\x94and besides, the fact that I\r\npropose a thing is generally a reason with him for rejecting it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the most curious contradiction in my grandfather: I know he\r\nmeans to leave me all the money he has saved, and he is likely enough\r\nto have cut off poor Aunt Lydia, who has been a slave to him all her\r\nlife, with only five hundred a-year, for the sake of giving me all the\r\nmore; and yet I sometimes think he positively hates me because I\xe2\x80\x99m his\r\nheir. I believe if I were to break my neck, he would feel it the\r\ngreatest misfortune that could befall him, and yet it seems a pleasure\r\nto him to make my life a series of petty annoyances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my boy, it is not only woman\xe2\x80\x99s love that is \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x92\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x82 as old\r\n\xc3\x86schylus calls it. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of \xe2\x80\x98unloving love\xe2\x80\x99 in the world of a\r\nmasculine kind. But tell me about Adam. Has he accepted the post? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see that it can be much more profitable than his present work,\r\nthough, to be sure, it will leave him a good deal of time on his own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to\r\nhesitate at first. His objection was that he thought he should not be\r\nable to satisfy my grandfather. But I begged him as a personal favour\r\nto me not to let any reason prevent him from accepting the place, if he\r\nreally liked the employment and would not be giving up anything that\r\nwas more profitable to him. And he assured me he should like it of all\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94it would be a great step forward for him in business, and it\r\nwould enable him to do what he had long wished to do, to give up\r\nworking for Burge. He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend\r\na little business of his own, which he and Seth will carry on, and will\r\nperhaps be able to enlarge by degrees. So he has agreed at last, and I\r\nhave arranged that he shall dine with the large tenants to-day; and I\r\nmean to announce the appointment to them, and ask them to drink Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little drama I\xe2\x80\x99ve got up in honour of my friend Adam.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow, and I like the opportunity of letting people know\r\nthat I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part\r\nto play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, smiling. But when he saw Arthur colour, he\r\nwent on relentingly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy part, you know, is always that of the old fogy\r\nwho sees nothing to admire in the young folks. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to admit\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of my pupil when he does graceful things. But I must\r\nplay the amiable old gentleman for once, and second your toast in\r\nhonour of Adam. Has your grandfather yielded on the other point too,\r\nand agreed to have a respectable man as steward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, rising from his chair with an air of impatience\r\nand walking along the room with his hands in his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nsome project or other about letting the Chase Farm and bargaining for a\r\nsupply of milk and butter for the house. But I ask no questions about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it makes me too angry. I believe he means to do all the business\r\nhimself, and have nothing in the shape of a steward. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what\r\nenergy he has, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the ladies now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, rising too. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to tell my mother what a splendid throne you\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared for her\r\nunder the marquee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and we must be going to luncheon too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock, for there is the gong beginning to sound for the tenants\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndinners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\nDinner-Time\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Adam heard that he was to dine upstairs with the large tenants, he\r\nfelt rather uncomfortable at the idea of being exalted in this way\r\nabove his mother and Seth, who were to dine in the cloisters below. But\r\nMr. Mills, the butler, assured him that Captain Donnithorne had given\r\nparticular orders about it, and would be very angry if Adam was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAdam nodded and went up to Seth, who was standing a few yards off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeth, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe captain has sent to say I\xe2\x80\x99m to dine\r\nupstairs\xe2\x80\x94he wishes it particular, Mr. Mills says, so I suppose it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe behaving ill for me not to go. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like sitting up above\r\nthee and mother, as if I was better than my own flesh and blood. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnot take it unkind, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cthy honour\xe2\x80\x99s our honour; and if thee\r\nget\xe2\x80\x99st respect, thee\xe2\x80\x99st won it by thy own deserts. The further I see\r\nthee above me, the better, so long as thee feel\xe2\x80\x99st like a brother to\r\nme. It\xe2\x80\x99s because o\xe2\x80\x99 thy being appointed over the woods, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing but what\xe2\x80\x99s right. That\xe2\x80\x99s a place o\xe2\x80\x99 trust, and thee\xe2\x80\x99t above a\r\ncommon workman now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cbut nobody knows a word about it yet. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngiven notice to Mr. Burge about leaving him, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to tell\r\nanybody else about it before he knows, for he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good bit hurt, I\r\ndoubt. People \xe2\x80\x99ull be wondering to see me there, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll like\r\nenough be guessing the reason and asking questions, for there\xe2\x80\x99s been so\r\nmuch talk up and down about my having the place, this last three\r\nweeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being told the\r\nreason. That\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. And mother \xe2\x80\x99ull be fine and joyful about it.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was not the only guest invited to come upstairs on other grounds\r\nthan the amount he contributed to the rent-roll. There were other\r\npeople in the two parishes who derived dignity from their functions\r\nrather than from their pocket, and of these Bartle Massey was one. His\r\nlame walk was rather slower than usual on this warm day, so Adam\r\nlingered behind when the bell rang for dinner, that he might walk up\r\nwith his old friend; for he was a little too shy to join the Poyser\r\nparty on this public occasion. Opportunities of getting to Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\nwould be sure to turn up in the course of the day, and Adam contented\r\nhimself with that for he disliked any risk of being \xe2\x80\x9cjoked\xe2\x80\x9d about\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x94the big, outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to\r\nhis love-making.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mester Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, as Bartle came up \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to dine\r\nupstairs with you to-day: the captain\xe2\x80\x99s sent me orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, pausing, with one hand on his back. \xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething in the wind\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s something in the wind. Have you heard\r\nanything about what the old squire means to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I know, because I believe\r\nyou can keep a still tongue in your head if you like, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot let drop a word till it\xe2\x80\x99s common talk, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve particular reasons\r\nagainst its being known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust to me, my boy, trust to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no wife to worm it out of\r\nme and then run out and cackle it in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. If you trust\r\na man, let him be a bachelor\xe2\x80\x94let him be a bachelor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it was so far settled yesterday that I\xe2\x80\x99m to take the\r\nmanagement o\xe2\x80\x99 the woods. The captain sent for me t\xe2\x80\x99 offer it me, when I\r\nwas seeing to the poles and things here and I\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to\xe2\x80\x99t. But if\r\nanybody asks any questions upstairs, just you take no notice, and turn\r\nthe talk to something else, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be obliged to you. Now, let us go\r\non, for we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty nigh the last, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what to do, never fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, moving on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe news will\r\nbe good sauce to my dinner. Aye, aye, my boy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll back\r\nyou for an eye at measuring and a head-piece for figures, against any\r\nman in this county and you\xe2\x80\x99ve had good teaching\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve had good\r\nteaching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they got upstairs, the question which Arthur had left unsettled,\r\nas to who was to be president, and who vice, was still under\r\ndiscussion, so that Adam\xe2\x80\x99s entrance passed without remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stands to sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Casson was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cas old Mr. Poyser, as is\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 oldest man i\xe2\x80\x99 the room, should sit at top o\xe2\x80\x99 the table. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbutler fifteen year without learning the rights and the wrongs about\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Martin, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99n gi\xe2\x80\x99en up to my son; I\xe2\x80\x99m no tenant\r\nnow: let my son take my place. Th\xe2\x80\x99 ould foulks ha\xe2\x80\x99 had their turn: they\r\nmun make way for the young uns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought the biggest tenant had the best right, more nor\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 oldest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke Britton, who was not fond of the critical Mr.\r\nPoyser; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s Mester Holdsworth has more land nor anybody else on\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose we say the man wi\xe2\x80\x99 the foulest land\r\nshall sit at top; then whoever gets th\xe2\x80\x99 honour, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no envying\r\non him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mester Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig, who, being a neutral in the\r\ndispute, had no interest but in conciliation; \xe2\x80\x9cthe schoolmaster ought\r\nto be able to tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s right. Who\xe2\x80\x99s to sit at top o\xe2\x80\x99 the table,\r\nMr. Massey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the broadest man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle; \xe2\x80\x9cand then he won\xe2\x80\x99t take up other\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 room; and the next broadest must sit at bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis happy mode of settling the dispute produced much laughter\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsmaller joke would have sufficed for that. Mr. Casson, however, did not\r\nfeel it compatible with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in\r\nthe laugh, until it turned out that he was fixed on as the second\r\nbroadest man. Martin Poyser the younger, as the broadest, was to be\r\npresident, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest, was to be vice.\r\n\r\nOwing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the\r\ntable, fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too\r\nmuch occupied with the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed\r\nhis entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen, considered Adam \xe2\x80\x9crather lifted\r\nup and peppery-like\xe2\x80\x9d: he thought the gentry made more fuss about this\r\nyoung carpenter than was necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson,\r\nalthough he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Bede, you\xe2\x80\x99re one o\xe2\x80\x99 them as mounts hup\xe2\x80\x99ards apace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nwhen Adam sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve niver dined here before, as I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Casson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard\r\nalong the table; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never dined here before, but I come by Captain\r\nDonnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not disagreeable to anybody here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices at once, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re glad ye\xe2\x80\x99re come. Who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot anything to say again\xe2\x80\x99 it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye\xe2\x80\x99ll sing us \xe2\x80\x98Over the hills and far away,\xe2\x80\x99 after dinner, wonna\r\nye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Chowne. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a song I\xe2\x80\x99m uncommon fond on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeeh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not to be named by side o\xe2\x80\x99 the Scotch\r\ntunes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never cared about singing myself; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had something better\r\nto do. A man that\xe2\x80\x99s got the names and the natur o\xe2\x80\x99 plants in\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nisna likely to keep a hollow place t\xe2\x80\x99 hold tunes in. But a second\r\ncousin o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, a drovier, was a rare hand at remembering the Scotch\r\ntunes. He\xe2\x80\x99d got nothing else to think on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scotch tunes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nenough o\xe2\x80\x99 the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. They\xe2\x80\x99re fit for\r\nnothing but to frighten the birds with\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s to say, the English\r\nbirds, for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I know. Give the\r\nlads a bagpipe instead of a rattle, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it the corn \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s folks as find a pleasure in undervallying what they know\r\nbut little about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding, nagging woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Bartle\r\nwent on, without deigning to notice Mr. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s remark. \xe2\x80\x9cThey go on\r\nwith the same thing over and over again, and never come to a reasonable\r\nend. Anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think the Scotch tunes had always been asking a\r\nquestion of somebody as deaf as old Taft, and had never got an answer\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson, because this position\r\nenabled him to see Hetty, who was not far off him at the next table.\r\nHetty, however, had not even noticed his presence yet, for she was\r\ngiving angry attention to Totty, who insisted on drawing up her feet on\r\nto the bench in antique fashion, and thereby threatened to make dusty\r\nmarks on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s pink-and-white frock. No sooner were the little fat\r\nlegs pushed down than up they came again, for Totty\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were too\r\nbusy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was\r\nfor her to retain any consciousness of her legs. Hetty got quite out of\r\npatience, and at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, Aunt, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d speak to Totty; she keeps putting\r\nher legs up so, and messing my frock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter wi\xe2\x80\x99 the child? She can niver please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmother. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her come by the side o\xe2\x80\x99 me, then. _I_ can put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and the dark\r\neyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered tears. Quiet\r\nMary Burge, who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed on her, thought that so sensible a man as Adam\r\nmust be reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper\r\nwas bad. Mary was a good girl, not given to indulge in evil feelings,\r\nbut she said to herself, that, since Hetty had a bad temper, it was\r\nbetter Adam should know it. And it was quite true that if Hetty had\r\nbeen plain, she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that\r\nmoment, and no one\xe2\x80\x99s moral judgment upon her would have been in the\r\nleast beguiled. But really there was something quite charming in her\r\npettishness: it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill\r\nhumour; and the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation; he only\r\nfelt a sort of amused pity, as if he had seen a kitten setting up its\r\nback, or a little bird with its feathers ruffled. He could not gather\r\nwhat was vexing her, but it was impossible to him to feel otherwise\r\nthan that she was the prettiest thing in the world, and that if he\r\ncould have his way, nothing should ever vex her any more. And\r\npresently, when Totty was gone, she caught his eye, and her face broke\r\ninto one of its brightest smiles, as she nodded to him. It was a bit of\r\nflirtation\xe2\x80\x94she knew Mary Burge was looking at them. But the smile was\r\nlike wine to Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\nThe Health-Drinking\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was over, and the first draughts from the great cask of\r\nbirthday ale were brought up, room was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at\r\nthe side of the table, and two chairs were placed at the head. It had\r\nbeen settled very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young\r\nsquire should appear, and for the last five minutes he had been in a\r\nstate of abstraction, with his eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite,\r\nand his hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his\r\nbreeches pockets.\r\n\r\nWhen the young squire entered, with Mr. Irwine by his side, every one\r\nstood up, and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur. He\r\nliked to feel his own importance, and besides that, he cared a great\r\ndeal for the good-will of these people: he was fond of thinking that\r\nthey had a hearty, special regard for him. The pleasure he felt was in\r\nhis face as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy grandfather and I hope all our friends here\r\nhave enjoyed their dinner, and find my birthday ale good. Mr. Irwine\r\nand I are come to taste it with you, and I am sure we shall all like\r\nanything the better that the rector shares with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser, who, with his hands still busy\r\nin his pockets, began with the deliberateness of a slow-striking clock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, my neighbours have put it upo\xe2\x80\x99 me to speak for \xe2\x80\x99em to-day,\r\nfor where folks think pretty much alike, one spokesman\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a\r\nscore. And though we\xe2\x80\x99ve mayhappen got contrairy ways o\xe2\x80\x99 thinking about\r\na many things\xe2\x80\x94one man lays down his land one way an\xe2\x80\x99 another\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll not take it upon me to speak to no man\xe2\x80\x99s farming, but\r\nmy own\xe2\x80\x94this I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, as we\xe2\x80\x99re all o\xe2\x80\x99 one mind about our young squire.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve pretty nigh all on us known you when you war a little un, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve niver known anything on you but what was good an\xe2\x80\x99 honorable. You\r\nspeak fair an\xe2\x80\x99 y\xe2\x80\x99 act fair, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99re joyful when we look forrard to\r\nyour being our landlord, for we \xe2\x80\x99lieve you mean to do right by\r\neverybody, an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ull make no man\xe2\x80\x99s bread bitter to him if you can help\r\nit. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s what we all mean; and when a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaid what he means, he\xe2\x80\x99d better stop, for th\xe2\x80\x99 ale \xe2\x80\x99ull be none the\r\nbetter for stannin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll not say how we like th\xe2\x80\x99 ale yet, for we\r\ncouldna well taste it till we\xe2\x80\x99d drunk your health in it; but the dinner\r\nwas good, an\xe2\x80\x99 if there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody hasna enjoyed it, it must be the fault\r\nof his own inside. An\xe2\x80\x99 as for the rector\xe2\x80\x99s company, it\xe2\x80\x99s well known as\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s welcome t\xe2\x80\x99 all the parish wherever he may be; an\xe2\x80\x99 I hope, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\r\nall hope, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll live to see us old folks, an\xe2\x80\x99 our children grown to\r\nmen an\xe2\x80\x99 women an\xe2\x80\x99 Your Honour a family man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more to say as\r\nconcerns the present time, an\xe2\x80\x99 so we\xe2\x80\x99ll drink our young squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth\xe2\x80\x94three times three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereupon a glorious shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering, and\r\na shouting, with plentiful _da capo_, pleasanter than a strain of\r\nsublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first\r\ntime. Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech, but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being\r\npraised. Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole? If there\r\nwas something in his conduct that Poyser wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked if he had\r\nknown it, why, no man\xe2\x80\x99s conduct will bear too close an inspection; and\r\nPoyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what had he done?\r\nGone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in his\r\nplace would have acted much worse; and no harm would come\xe2\x80\x94no harm\r\n_should_ come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would\r\nexplain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had\r\npassed. It was necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with\r\nhimself. Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions\r\nfor the future, which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be\r\nuncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s slow speech\r\nwas finished, and when it was time for him to speak he was quite\r\nlight-hearted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you all, my good friends and neighbours,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthe good opinion of me, and the kind feelings towards me which Mr.\r\nPoyser has been expressing on your behalf and on his own, and it will\r\nalways be my heartiest wish to deserve them. In the course of things we\r\nmay expect that, if I live, I shall one day or other be your landlord;\r\nindeed, it is on the ground of that expectation that my grandfather has\r\nwished me to celebrate this day and to come among you now; and I look\r\nforward to this position, not merely as one of power and pleasure for\r\nmyself, but as a means of benefiting my neighbours. It hardly becomes\r\nso young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you, who are most\r\nof you so much older, and are men of experience; still, I have\r\ninterested myself a good deal in such matters, and learned as much\r\nabout them as my opportunities have allowed; and when the course of\r\nevents shall place the estate in my hands, it will be my first desire\r\nto afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord can give them, in\r\nimproving their land and trying to bring about a better practice of\r\nhusbandry. It will be my wish to be looked on by all my deserving\r\ntenants as their best friend, and nothing would make me so happy as to\r\nbe able to respect every man on the estate, and to be respected by him\r\nin return. It is not my place at present to enter into particulars; I\r\nonly meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own\r\nhopes correspond to them\xe2\x80\x94that what you expect from me I desire to\r\nfulfil; and I am quite of Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, that when a man has\r\nsaid what he means, he had better stop. But the pleasure I feel in\r\nhaving my own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not\r\ndrink the health of my grandfather, who has filled the place of both\r\nparents to me. I will say no more, until you have joined me in drinking\r\nhis health on a day when he has wished me to appear among you as the\r\nfuture representative of his name and family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who thoroughly\r\nunderstood and approved Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s graceful mode of proposing his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s health. The farmers thought the young squire knew well\r\nenough that they hated the old squire, and Mrs. Poyser said, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter not ha\xe2\x80\x99 stirred a kettle o\xe2\x80\x99 sour broth.\xe2\x80\x9d The bucolic mind does\r\nnot readily apprehend the refinements of good taste. But the toast\r\ncould not be rejected and when it had been drunk, Arthur said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank\r\nyou, both for my grandfather and myself; and now there is one more\r\nthing I wish to tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I\r\nhope and believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not\r\na respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for my\r\nfriend Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood\r\nthat there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his; that\r\nwhatever he undertakes to do, he does well, and is as careful for the\r\ninterests of those who employ him as for his own. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say that\r\nI was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy, and I have never lost\r\nmy old feeling for him\xe2\x80\x94I think that shows that I know a good fellow\r\nwhen I find him. It has long been my wish that he should have the\r\nmanagement of the woods on the estate, which happen to be very\r\nvaluable, not only because I think so highly of his character, but\r\nbecause he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place.\r\nAnd I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s wish too, and it\r\nis now settled that Adam shall manage the woods\xe2\x80\x94a change which I am\r\nsure will be very much for the advantage of the estate; and I hope you\r\nwill by and by join me in drinking his health, and in wishing him all\r\nthe prosperity in life that he deserves. But there is a still older\r\nfriend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not tell you that it\r\nis Mr. Irwine. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will agree with me that we must drink no\r\nother person\xe2\x80\x99s health until we have drunk his. I know you have all\r\nreason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason\r\nas I. Come, charge your glasses, and let us drink to our excellent\r\nrector\xe2\x80\x94three times three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the\r\nlast, and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene\r\nwhen Mr. Irwine got up to speak, and all the faces in the room were\r\nturned towards him. The superior refinement of his face was much more\r\nstriking than that of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s when seen in comparison with the people\r\nround them. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s was a much commoner British face, and the\r\nsplendour of his new-fashioned clothes was more akin to the young\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s taste in costume than Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s powder and the well-brushed\r\nbut well-worn black, which seemed to be his chosen suit for great\r\noccasions; for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a\r\nnew-looking coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the first time, by a great many,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have\r\nhad to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill,\r\nbut neighbourly kindness is among those things that are the more\r\nprecious the older they get. Indeed, our pleasant meeting to-day is a\r\nproof that when what is good comes of age and is likely to live, there\r\nis reason for rejoicing, and the relation between us as clergyman and\r\nparishioners came of age two years ago, for it is three-and-twenty\r\nyears since I first came among you, and I see some tall fine-looking\r\nyoung men here, as well as some blooming young women, that were far\r\nfrom looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy\r\nto see them looking now. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will not wonder when I say\r\nthat among all those young men, the one in whom I have the strongest\r\ninterest is my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne, for whom you have just\r\nexpressed your regard. I had the pleasure of being his tutor for\r\nseveral years, and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him\r\nintimately which cannot have occurred to any one else who is present;\r\nand I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share\r\nyour high hopes concerning him, and your confidence in his possession\r\nof those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when the\r\ntime shall come for him to take that important position among you. We\r\nfeel alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty\r\ncan feel in common with a young man of one-and-twenty, and he has just\r\nbeen expressing a feeling which I share very heartily, and I would not\r\nwillingly omit the opportunity of saying so. That feeling is his value\r\nand respect for Adam Bede. People in a high station are of course more\r\nthought of and talked about and have their virtues more praised, than\r\nthose whose lives are passed in humble everyday work; but every\r\nsensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is, and how\r\nimportant it is to us that it should be done well. And I agree with my\r\nfriend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty\r\nlies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an\r\nexample in any station, his merit should be acknowledged. He is one of\r\nthose to whom honour is due, and his friends should delight to honour\r\nhim. I know Adam Bede well\xe2\x80\x94I know what he is as a workman, and what he\r\nhas been as a son and brother\xe2\x80\x94and I am saying the simplest truth when I\r\nsay that I respect him as much as I respect any man living. But I am\r\nnot speaking to you about a stranger; some of you are his intimate\r\nfriends, and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough\r\nof him to join heartily in drinking his health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nbumper to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and\r\nclever as himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as\r\nMr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cTough work\xe2\x80\x9d as his first speech had been, he would have\r\nstarted up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity\r\nof such a course. As it was, he found an outlet for his feeling in\r\ndrinking his ale unusually fast, and setting down his glass with a\r\nswing of his arm and a determined rap. If Jonathan Burge and a few\r\nothers felt less comfortable on the occasion, they tried their best to\r\nlook contented, and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nAdam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends.\r\nHe was a good deal moved by this public tribute\xe2\x80\x94very naturally, for he\r\nwas in the presence of all his little world, and it was uniting to do\r\nhim honour. But he felt no shyness about speaking, not being troubled\r\nwith small vanity or lack of words; he looked neither awkward nor\r\nembarrassed, but stood in his usual firm upright attitude, with his\r\nhead thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still, in that\r\nrough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent, honest, well-built\r\nworkmen, who are never wondering what is their business in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite taken by surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthis sort, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal more than my wages. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve the more\r\nreason to be grateful to you, Captain, and to you, Mr. Irwine, and to\r\nall my friends here, who\xe2\x80\x99ve drunk my health and wished me well. It \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe nonsense for me to be saying, I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all deserve th\xe2\x80\x99 opinion you\r\nhave of me; that \xe2\x80\x99ud be poor thanks to you, to say that you\xe2\x80\x99ve known me\r\nall these years and yet haven\xe2\x80\x99t sense enough to find out a great deal\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the truth about me. You think, if I undertake to do a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it well, be my pay big or little\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true. But it seems to me\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x99s plain duty, and nothing to be conceited about, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty clear to me as I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done more than my duty; for let us do\r\nwhat we will, it\xe2\x80\x99s only making use o\xe2\x80\x99 the sperrit and the powers that\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 been given to us. And so this kindness o\xe2\x80\x99 yours, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, is no\r\ndebt you owe me, but a free gift, and as such I accept it and am\r\nthankful. And as to this new employment I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in hand, I\xe2\x80\x99ll only\r\nsay that I took it at Captain Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s desire, and that I\xe2\x80\x99ll try\r\nto fulfil his expectations. I\xe2\x80\x99d wish for no better lot than to work\r\nunder him, and to know that while I was getting my own bread I was\r\ntaking care of his int\xe2\x80\x99rests. For I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 those gentlemen\r\nas wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better\r\nthan he found it, which it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief every man may do, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngentle or simple, whether he sets a good bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work going and finds\r\nthe money, or whether he does the work with his own hands. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\noccasion for me to say any more about what I feel towards him: I hope\r\nto show it through the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 my life in my actions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were various opinions about Adam\xe2\x80\x99s speech: some of the women\r\nwhispered that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t show himself thankful enough, and seemed to\r\nspeak as proud as could be; but most of the men were of opinion that\r\nnobody could speak more straightfor\xe2\x80\x99ard, and that Adam was as fine a\r\nchap as need to be. While such observations were being buzzed about,\r\nmingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a\r\nbailiff, and whether he was going to have a steward, the two gentlemen\r\nhad risen, and were walking round to the table where the wives and\r\nchildren sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but\r\nwine and dessert\xe2\x80\x94sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good\r\nsherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and\r\nTotty was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into\r\na wine-glass in search of the nuts floating there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mrs. Poyser?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you pleased to hear\r\nyour husband make such a good speech to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tied\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re forced partly to\r\nguess what they mean, as you do wi\xe2\x80\x99 the dumb creaturs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you think you could have made it better for him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nIrwine, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, when I want to say anything, I can mostly find words to say\r\nit in, thank God. Not as I\xe2\x80\x99m a-finding faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 my husband, for if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na man o\xe2\x80\x99 few words, what he says he\xe2\x80\x99ll stand to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I never saw a prettier party than this,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said, looking\r\nround at the apple-cheeked children. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt and the Miss Irwines will\r\ncome up and see you presently. They were afraid of the noise of the\r\ntoasts, but it would be a shame for them not to see you at table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the children, while\r\nMr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a\r\ndistance, that no one\xe2\x80\x99s attention might be disturbed from the young\r\nsquire, the hero of the day. Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty,\r\nbut merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side. The\r\nfoolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman\r\nwas ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be\r\nthe mask of love? Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable\r\nday she had had for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and\r\nreality came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her\r\nonly a few hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great\r\nprocession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\nThe Games\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great dance was not to begin until eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, but for any lads\r\nand lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then, there was\r\nmusic always at hand\xe2\x80\x94for was not the band of the Benefit Club capable\r\nof playing excellent jigs, reels, and hornpipes? And, besides this,\r\nthere was a grand band hired from Rosseter, who, with their wonderful\r\nwind-instruments and puffed-out cheeks, were themselves a delightful\r\nshow to the small boys and girls. To say nothing of Joshua Rann\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfiddle, which, by an act of generous forethought, he had provided\r\nhimself with, in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to\r\nprefer dancing to a solo on that instrument.\r\n\r\nMeantime, when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of\r\nthe house, the games began. There were, of course, well-soaped poles to\r\nbe climbed by the boys and youths, races to be run by the old women,\r\nraces to be run in sacks, heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men,\r\nand a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of\r\nwalking as many yards possible on one leg\xe2\x80\x94feats in which it was\r\ngenerally remarked that Wiry Ben, being \xe2\x80\x9cthe lissom\xe2\x80\x99st, springest\r\nfellow i\xe2\x80\x99 the country,\xe2\x80\x9d was sure to be pre-eminent. To crown all, there\r\nwas to be a donkey-race\xe2\x80\x94that sublimest of all races, conducted on the\r\ngrand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndonkey, and the sorriest donkey winning.\r\n\r\nAnd soon after four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, splendid old Mrs. Irwine, in her damask\r\nsatin and jewels and black lace, was led out by Arthur, followed by the\r\nwhole family party, to her raised seat under the striped marquee, where\r\nshe was to give out the prizes to the victors. Staid, formal Miss Lydia\r\nhad requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady, and\r\nArthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaste for stateliness. Old Mr. Donnithorne, the delicately clean,\r\nfinely scented, withered old man, led out Miss Irwine, with his air of\r\npunctilious, acid politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia, looking\r\nneutral and stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr. Irwine came\r\nlast with his pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family, besides\r\nMr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner for the\r\nneighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the forces were\r\nrequired for the entertainment of the tenants.\r\n\r\nThere was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the lawn from\r\nthe park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the\r\nvictors, and the groups of people standing, or seated here and there on\r\nbenches, stretched on each side of the open space from the white\r\nmarquees up to the sunk fence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, in her deep\r\nvoice, when she was seated, and looked round on the bright scene with\r\nits dark-green background; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s the last f\xc3\xaate-day I\xe2\x80\x99m likely to\r\nsee, unless you make haste and get married, Arthur. But take care you\r\nget a charming bride, else I would rather die without seeing her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so terribly fastidious, Godmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\r\nshould never satisfy you with my choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive you if she\xe2\x80\x99s not handsome. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be put off\r\nwith amiability, which is always the excuse people are making for the\r\nexistence of plain people. And she must not be silly; that will never\r\ndo, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll want managing, and a silly woman can\xe2\x80\x99t manage you.\r\nWho is that tall young man, Dauphin, with the mild face? There,\r\nstanding without his hat, and taking such care of that tall old woman\r\nby the side of him\xe2\x80\x94his mother, of course. I like to see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know him, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Seth\r\nBede, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x94a Methodist, but a very good fellow. Poor Seth has\r\nlooked rather down-hearted of late; I thought it was because of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s dying in that sad way, but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to\r\nmarry that sweet little Methodist preacher who was here about a month\r\nago, and I suppose she refused him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I remember hearing about her. But there are no end of people here\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for they\xe2\x80\x99re grown up and altered so since I used to\r\ngo about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat excellent sight you have!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mr. Donnithorne, who was\r\nholding a double glass up to his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the expression of that\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s face so far off. His face is nothing but a pale blurred\r\nspot to me. But I fancy I have the advantage of you when we come to\r\nlook close. I can read small print without spectacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear sir, you began with being very near-sighted, and those\r\nnear-sighted eyes always wear the best. I want very strong spectacles\r\nto read with, but then I think my eyes get better and better for things\r\nat a distance. I suppose if I could live another fifty years, I should\r\nbe blind to everything that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t out of other people\xe2\x80\x99s sight, like a\r\nman who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old women are ready to set out on their race\r\nnow. Which do you bet on, Gawaine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe long-legged one, unless they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have several heats, and\r\nthen the little wiry one may win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the Poysers, Mother, not far off on the right hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Poyser is looking at you. Do take notice of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to Mrs.\r\nPoyser. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to be\r\nneglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her\r\nknee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Hetty Sorrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x94a very likely young person, and well-looking too. My maid has\r\ntaught her fine needlework, and she has mended some lace of mine very\r\nrespectably indeed\xe2\x80\x94very respectably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years, Mother; you\r\nmust have seen her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Irwine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen her, child\xe2\x80\x94at least not as she is now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nIrwine, continuing to look at Hetty. \xe2\x80\x9cWell-looking, indeed! She\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nperfect beauty! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything so pretty since my young days.\r\nWhat a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the\r\nfarmers, when it\xe2\x80\x99s wanted so terribly among the good families without\r\nfortune! I daresay, now, she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry a man who would have thought her\r\njust as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was\r\nspeaking of her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with\r\nsomething on the opposite side. But he saw her plainly enough without\r\nlooking; saw her in heightened beauty, because he heard her beauty\r\npraised\xe2\x80\x94for other men\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, you know, was like a native climate to\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and\r\ngrew strong. Yes! She _was_ enough to turn any man\xe2\x80\x99s head: any man in\r\nhis place would have done and felt the same. And to give her up after\r\nall, as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always\r\nlook back upon with pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Irwine, replying to her last words; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nagree with you there. The common people are not quite so stupid as you\r\nimagine. The commonest man, who has his ounce of sense and feeling, is\r\nconscious of the difference between a lovely, delicate woman and a\r\ncoarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in their presence. The man\r\nmay be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more\r\nrefined beauty has on him, but he feels it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than\r\nmarried men, because they have time for more general contemplation.\r\nYour fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling\r\none woman his own. But, as an example of what I was saying, that pretty\r\nMethodist preacher I mentioned just now told me that she had preached\r\nto the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the\r\nutmost respect and kindness by them. The reason is\xe2\x80\x94though she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow it\xe2\x80\x94that there\xe2\x80\x99s so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about\r\nher. Such a woman as that brings with her \xe2\x80\x98airs from heaven\xe2\x80\x99 that the\r\ncoarsest fellow is not insensible to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a delicate bit of womanhood, or girlhood, coming to receive a\r\nprize, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gawaine. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must be one of the racers in\r\nthe sacks, who had set off before we came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cbit of womanhood\xe2\x80\x9d was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage,\r\notherwise Chad\xe2\x80\x99s Bess, whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had\r\nundergone an exaggeration of colour, which, if she had happened to be a\r\nheavenly body, would have made her sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say,\r\nhad taken to her ear-rings again since Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s departure, and was\r\notherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster. Any one\r\nwho could have looked into poor Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s heart would have seen a\r\nstriking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s. The advantage, perhaps, would have been on Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s side in the\r\nmatter of feeling. But then, you see, they were so very different\r\noutside! You would have been inclined to box Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and you\r\nwould have longed to kiss Hetty.\r\n\r\nBessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere\r\nhedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had said there\r\nwere to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and she approached\r\nthe marquee, fanning herself with her handkerchief, but with exultation\r\nsparkling in her round eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the prize for the first sack-race,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Lydia, taking a\r\nlarge parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to\r\nMrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, \xe2\x80\x9can excellent grogram gown and a\r\npiece of flannel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the winner was to be so young, I suppose, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArthur. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you find something else for this girl, and save that\r\ngrim-looking gown for one of the older women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nLydia, adjusting her own lace; \xe2\x80\x9cI should not think of encouraging a\r\nlove of finery in young women of that class. I have a scarlet cloak,\r\nbut that is for the old woman who wins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech of Miss Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s produced rather a mocking expression in\r\nMrs. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s face as she looked at Arthur, while Bessy came up and\r\ndropped a series of curtsies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Bessy Cranage, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cChad\r\nCranage\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. You remember Chad Cranage, the blacksmith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy, here is your\r\nprize\xe2\x80\x94excellent warm things for winter. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have had hard work\r\nto win them this warm day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessy\xe2\x80\x99s lip fell as she saw the ugly, heavy gown\xe2\x80\x94which felt so hot and\r\ndisagreeable too, on this July day, and was such a great ugly thing to\r\ncarry. She dropped her curtsies again, without looking up, and with a\r\ngrowing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth, and then turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur; \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s disappointed. I wish it had\r\nbeen something more to her taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a bold-looking young person,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Lydia. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\r\none I should like to encourage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money\r\nbefore the day was over, that she might buy something more to her mind;\r\nbut she, not aware of the consolation in store for her, turned out of\r\nthe open space, where she was visible from the marquee, and throwing\r\ndown the odious bundle under a tree, began to cry\xe2\x80\x94very much tittered at\r\nthe while by the small boys. In this situation she was descried by her\r\ndiscreet matronly cousin, who lost no time in coming up, having just\r\ngiven the baby into her husband\xe2\x80\x99s charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bess the matron, taking up the bundle\r\nand examining it. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99n sweltered yoursen, I reckon, running that\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s race. An\xe2\x80\x99 here, they\xe2\x80\x99n gi\xe2\x80\x99en you lots o\xe2\x80\x99 good grogram and\r\nflannel, as should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been gi\xe2\x80\x99en by good rights to them as had the\r\nsense to keep away from such foolery. Ye might spare me a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\ngrogram to make clothes for the lad\xe2\x80\x94ye war ne\xe2\x80\x99er ill-natured, Bess; I\r\nne\xe2\x80\x99er said that on ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may take it all, for what I care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bess the maiden, with a\r\npettish movement, beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I could do wi\xe2\x80\x99t, if so be ye want to get rid on\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndisinterested cousin, walking quickly away with the bundle, lest Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBess should change her mind.\r\n\r\nBut that bonny-cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits\r\nthat secured her from any rankling grief; and by the time the grand\r\nclimax of the donkey-race came on, her disappointment was entirely lost\r\nin the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey\r\nby hisses, while the boys applied the argument of sticks. But the\r\nstrength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the\r\narguments urged, which, well considered, requires as great a mental\r\nforce as the direct sequence; and the present donkey proved the\r\nfirst-rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill\r\njust when the blows were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd,\r\nradiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate\r\nrider of this superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the\r\nmidst of its triumph.\r\n\r\nArthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill was made\r\nhappy with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with blades and gimlets\r\nenough to make a man at home on a desert island. He had hardly returned\r\nfrom the marquee with the prize in his hand, when it began to be\r\nunderstood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company, before the\r\ngentry went to dinner, with an impromptu and gratuitous\r\nperformance\xe2\x80\x94namely, a hornpipe, the main idea of which was doubtless\r\nborrowed; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and\r\ncomplex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality.\r\nWiry Ben\xe2\x80\x99s pride in his dancing\xe2\x80\x94an accomplishment productive of great\r\neffect at the yearly Wake\xe2\x80\x94had needed only slightly elevating by an\r\nextra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be\r\nvery much struck with his performance of his hornpipe; and he had been\r\ndecidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann, who observed that it\r\nwas nothing but right to do something to please the young squire, in\r\nreturn for what he had done for them. You will be the less surprised at\r\nthis opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had\r\nrequested Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle, and Joshua felt\r\nquite sure that though there might not be much in the dancing, the\r\nmusic would make up for it. Adam Bede, who was present in one of the\r\nlarge marquees, where the plan was being discussed, told Ben he had\r\nbetter not make a fool of himself\xe2\x80\x94a remark which at once fixed Ben\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetermination: he was not going to let anything alone because Adam Bede\r\nturned up his nose at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mr. Donnithorne. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it something\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged, Arthur? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the clerk coming with his fiddle, and a\r\nsmart fellow with a nosegay in his button-hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur; \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about it. By Jove, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\ndance! It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the carpenters\xe2\x80\x94I forget his name at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Cranage\xe2\x80\x94Wiry Ben, they call him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine; \xe2\x80\x9crather a\r\nloose fish, I think. Anne, my dear, I see that fiddle-scraping is too\r\nmuch for you: you\xe2\x80\x99re getting tired. Let me take you in now, that you\r\nmay rest till dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Anne rose assentingly, and the good brother took her away, while\r\nJoshua\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary scrapings burst into the \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Cockade,\xe2\x80\x9d from\r\nwhich he intended to pass to a variety of tunes, by a series of\r\ntransitions which his good ear really taught him to execute with some\r\nskill. It would have been an exasperating fact to him, if he had known\r\nit, that the general attention was too thoroughly absorbed by Ben\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndancing for any one to give much heed to the music.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance? Perhaps\r\nyou have only seen a ballet rustic, smiling like a merry countryman in\r\ncrockery, with graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements\r\nof the head. That is as much like the real thing as the \xe2\x80\x9cBird Waltz\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nlike the song of birds. Wiry Ben never smiled: he looked as serious as\r\na dancing monkey\xe2\x80\x94as serious as if he had been an experimental\r\nphilosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount of shaking and\r\nthe varieties of angularity that could be given to the human limbs.\r\n\r\nTo make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee, Arthur\r\nclapped his hands continually and cried \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d But Ben had one\r\nadmirer whose eyes followed his movements with a fervid gravity that\r\nequalled his own. It was Martin Poyser, who was seated on a bench, with\r\nTommy between his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost think o\xe2\x80\x99 that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes as pat to the\r\nmusic as if he was made o\xe2\x80\x99 clockwork. I used to be a pretty good un at\r\ndancing myself when I was lighter, but I could niver ha\xe2\x80\x99 hit it just to\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 hair like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s little matter what his limbs are, to my thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d re-turned Mrs.\r\nPoyser. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s empty enough i\xe2\x80\x99 the upper story, or he\xe2\x80\x99d niver come\r\njigging an\xe2\x80\x99 stamping i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, like a mad grasshopper, for the\r\ngentry to look at him. They\xe2\x80\x99re fit to die wi\xe2\x80\x99 laughing, I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, so much the better, it amuses \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who\r\ndid not easily take an irritable view of things. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re going\r\naway now, t\xe2\x80\x99 have their dinner, I reckon. We\xe2\x80\x99ll move about a bit, shall\r\nwe, and see what Adam Bede\xe2\x80\x99s doing. He\xe2\x80\x99s got to look after the drinking\r\nand things: I doubt he hasna had much fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\nThe Dance\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur had chosen the entrance-hall for the ballroom: very wisely, for\r\nno other room could have been so airy, or would have had the advantage\r\nof the wide doors opening into the garden, as well as a ready entrance\r\ninto the other rooms. To be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest\r\nto dance on, but then, most of the dancers had known what it was to\r\nenjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries. It was one of those\r\nentrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms look like closets\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nstucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty ceiling, and\r\ngreat medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating with\r\nstatues in niches. Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with\r\ngreen boughs, and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his\r\nhothouse plants on the occasion. The broad steps of the stone staircase\r\nwere covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children, who were\r\nto stay till half-past nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing,\r\nand as this dance was confined to the chief tenants, there was abundant\r\nroom for every one. The lights were charmingly disposed in\r\ncoloured-paper lamps, high up among green boughs, and the farmers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwives and daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be more\r\nsplendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and\r\nqueen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins\r\nand acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how\r\nthings went on in the great world. The lamps were already lit, though\r\nthe sun had not long set, and there was that calm light out of doors in\r\nwhich we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty scene outside the house: the farmers and their families\r\nwere moving about the lawn, among the flowers and shrubs, or along the\r\nbroad straight road leading from the east front, where a carpet of\r\nmossy grass spread on each side, studded here and there with a dark\r\nflat-boughed cedar, or a grand pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with\r\nits branches, all tipped with a fringe of paler green. The groups of\r\ncottagers in the park were gradually diminishing, the young ones being\r\nattracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the\r\nwindows of the gallery in the abbey, which was to be their\r\ndancing-room, and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go\r\nhome quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with her\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nfrom filial attention only, for his conscience would not let him join\r\nin dancing. It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth: Dinah had\r\nnever been more constantly present with him than in this scene, where\r\neverything was so unlike her. He saw her all the more vividly after\r\nlooking at the thoughtless faces and gay-coloured dresses of the young\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94just as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured\r\nMadonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a\r\nvulgar head in a bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind only\r\nhelped him to bear the better with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mood, which had been\r\nbecoming more and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was\r\nsuffering from a strange conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the\r\nhonour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the\r\nconflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam\r\ncame to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the\r\ndancers in the hall. Adam was getting more and more out of her reach;\r\nshe wished all the old troubles back again, for then it mattered more\r\nto Adam what his mother said and did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine talkin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 dancin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 thy father not a\r\nfive week in\xe2\x80\x99s grave. An\xe2\x80\x99 I wish I war there too, i\xe2\x80\x99stid o\xe2\x80\x99 bein\xe2\x80\x99 left\r\nto take up merrier folks\xe2\x80\x99s room above ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, who was\r\ndetermined to be gentle to her to-day. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to dance\xe2\x80\x94I shall\r\nonly look on. And since the captain wishes me to be there, it \xe2\x80\x99ud look\r\nas if I thought I knew better than him to say as I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not stay.\r\nAnd thee know\xe2\x80\x99st how he\xe2\x80\x99s behaved to me to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, thee\xe2\x80\x99t do as thee lik\xe2\x80\x99st, for thy old mother\xe2\x80\x99s got no right t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhinder thee. She\xe2\x80\x99s nought but th\xe2\x80\x99 old husk, and thee\xe2\x80\x99st slipped away\r\nfrom her, like the ripe nut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and tell the captain as it hurts\r\nthy feelings for me to stay, and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go home upo\xe2\x80\x99 that account:\r\nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t take it ill then, I daresay, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this\r\nwith some effort, for he really longed to be near Hetty this evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, I wonna ha\xe2\x80\x99 thee do that\xe2\x80\x94the young squire \xe2\x80\x99ull be angered.\r\nGo an\xe2\x80\x99 do what thee\xe2\x80\x99t ordered to do, an\xe2\x80\x99 me and Seth \xe2\x80\x99ull go whome. I\r\nknow it\xe2\x80\x99s a grit honour for thee to be so looked on\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 who\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\nprouder on it nor thy mother? Hadna she the cumber o\xe2\x80\x99 rearin\xe2\x80\x99 thee an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoin\xe2\x80\x99 for thee all these \xe2\x80\x99ears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, then, Mother\xe2\x80\x94good-bye, lad\xe2\x80\x94remember Gyp when you get\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, turning away towards the gate of the\r\npleasure-grounds, where he hoped he might be able to join the Poysers,\r\nfor he had been so occupied throughout the afternoon that he had had no\r\ntime to speak to Hetty. His eye soon detected a distant group, which he\r\nknew to be the right one, returning to the house along the broad gravel\r\nroad, and he hastened on to meet them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Adam, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to get sight on y\xe2\x80\x99 again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who\r\nwas carrying Totty on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going t\xe2\x80\x99 have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 fun, I\r\nhope, now your work\xe2\x80\x99s all done. And here\xe2\x80\x99s Hetty has promised no end o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npartners, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been askin\xe2\x80\x99 her if she\xe2\x80\x99d agreed to dance wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou, an\xe2\x80\x99 she says no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 dancing to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, already tempted\r\nto change his mind, as he looked at Hetty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to dance to-night,\r\nall but th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Best\xe2\x80\x99s been tellin\xe2\x80\x99 us as\r\nMiss Lyddy and Miss Irwine \xe2\x80\x99ull dance, an\xe2\x80\x99 the young squire \xe2\x80\x99ull pick\r\nmy wife for his first partner, t\xe2\x80\x99 open the ball: so she\xe2\x80\x99ll be forced to\r\ndance, though she\xe2\x80\x99s laid by ever sin\xe2\x80\x99 the Christmas afore the little un\r\nwas born. You canna for shame stand still, Adam, an\xe2\x80\x99 you a fine young\r\nfellow and can dance as well as anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cit \xe2\x80\x99ud be unbecomin\xe2\x80\x99. I know the\r\ndancin\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, but if you stick at everything because it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnonsense, you wonna go far i\xe2\x80\x99 this life. When your broth\xe2\x80\x99s ready-made\r\nfor you, you mun swallow the thickenin\xe2\x80\x99, or else let the broth alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if Hetty \xe2\x80\x99ull dance with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, yielding either to Mrs.\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x99s argument or to something else, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll dance whichever dance\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got no partner for the fourth dance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll dance\r\nthat with you, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you mun dance the first dance, Adam, else\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll look partic\xe2\x80\x99ler. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 nice partners to pick an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchoose from, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the gells when the men stan\xe2\x80\x99 by and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam felt the justice of Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s observation: it would not do for\r\nhim to dance with no one besides Hetty; and remembering that Jonathan\r\nBurge had some reason to feel hurt to-day, he resolved to ask Miss Mary\r\nto dance with him the first dance, if she had no other partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the big clock strikin\xe2\x80\x99 eight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must make\r\nhaste in now, else the squire and the ladies \xe2\x80\x99ull be in afore us, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat wouldna look well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had entered the hall, and the three children under Molly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharge had been seated on the stairs, the folding-doors of the\r\ndrawing-room were thrown open, and Arthur entered in his regimentals,\r\nleading Mrs. Irwine to a carpet-covered dais ornamented with hot-house\r\nplants, where she and Miss Anne were to be seated with old Mr.\r\nDonnithorne, that they might look on at the dancing, like the kings and\r\nqueens in the plays. Arthur had put on his uniform to please the\r\ntenants, he said, who thought as much of his militia dignity as if it\r\nhad been an elevation to the premiership. He had not the least\r\nobjection to gratify them in that way: his uniform was very\r\nadvantageous to his figure.\r\n\r\nThe old squire, before sitting down, walked round the hall to greet the\r\ntenants and make polite speeches to the wives: he was always polite;\r\nbut the farmers had found out, after long puzzling, that this polish\r\nwas one of the signs of hardness. It was observed that he gave his most\r\nelaborate civility to Mrs. Poyser to-night, inquiring particularly\r\nabout her health, recommending her to strengthen herself with cold\r\nwater as he did, and avoid all drugs. Mrs. Poyser curtsied and thanked\r\nhim with great self-command, but when he had passed on, she whispered\r\nto her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lay my life he\xe2\x80\x99s brewin\xe2\x80\x99 some nasty turn against\r\nus. Old Harry doesna wag his tail so for nothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poyser had no\r\ntime to answer, for now Arthur came up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Poyser, I\xe2\x80\x99m come\r\nto request the favour of your hand for the first dance; and, Mr.\r\nPoyser, you must let me take you to my aunt, for she claims you as her\r\npartner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wife\xe2\x80\x99s pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour\r\nas Arthur led her to the top of the room; but Mr. Poyser, to whom an\r\nextra glass had restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and\r\ngood dancing, walked along with them quite proudly, secretly flattering\r\nhimself that Miss Lydia had never had a partner in _her_ life who could\r\nlift her off the ground as he would. In order to balance the honours\r\ngiven to the two parishes, Miss Irwine danced with Luke Britton, the\r\nlargest Broxton farmer, and Mr. Gawaine led out Mrs. Britton. Mr.\r\nIrwine, after seating his sister Anne, had gone to the abbey gallery,\r\nas he had agreed with Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of\r\nthe cottagers was prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished\r\ncouples had taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr.\r\nCraig, and Mary Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the\r\nglorious country-dance, best of all dances, began.\r\n\r\nPity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of the\r\nthick shoes would have been better than any drums. That merry stamping,\r\nthat gracious nodding of the head, that waving bestowal of the\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94where can we see them now? That simple dancing of well-covered\r\nmatrons, laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy,\r\nremembering but not affecting youth, not jealous but proud of the young\r\nmaidens by their side\xe2\x80\x94that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands\r\npaying little compliments to their wives, as if their courting days\r\nwere come again\xe2\x80\x94those lads and lasses a little confused and awkward\r\nwith their partners, having nothing to say\xe2\x80\x94it would be a pleasant\r\nvariety to see all that sometimes, instead of low dresses and large\r\nskirts, and scanning glances exploring costumes, and languid men in\r\nlacquered boots smiling with double meaning.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing to mar Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure in this dance:\r\nit was that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton, that\r\nslovenly farmer. He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into\r\nhis eye in the crossing of hands; but then, as Miss Irwine was opposite\r\nto him instead of the offensive Luke, he might freeze the wrong person.\r\nSo he gave his face up to hilarity, unchilled by moral judgments.\r\n\r\nHow Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat as Arthur approached her! He had hardly looked\r\nat her to-day: now he _must_ take her hand. Would he press it? Would he\r\nlook at her? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of\r\nfeeling. Now he was there\xe2\x80\x94he had taken her hand\xe2\x80\x94yes, he was pressing\r\nit. Hetty turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met\r\nhis eyes, before the dance carried him away. That pale look came upon\r\nArthur like the beginning of a dull pain, which clung to him, though he\r\nmust dance and smile and joke all the same. Hetty would look so, when\r\nhe told her what he had to tell her; and he should never be able to\r\nbear it\xe2\x80\x94he should be a fool and give way again. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s look did not\r\nreally mean so much as he thought: it was only the sign of a struggle\r\nbetween the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should\r\nbetray the desire to others. But Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face had a language that\r\ntranscended her feelings. There are faces which nature charges with a\r\nmeaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters\r\nbeneath them, but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone\r\ngenerations\xe2\x80\x94eyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is\r\nsomewhere, but not paired with these eyes\xe2\x80\x94perhaps paired with pale eyes\r\nthat can say nothing; just as a national language may be instinct with\r\npoetry unfelt by the lips that use it. That look of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s oppressed\r\nArthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed\r\ndelight in it, that she loved him too well. There was a hard task\r\nbefore him, for at that moment he felt he would have given up three\r\nyears of his youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without\r\nremorse to his passion for Hetty.\r\n\r\nThese were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs. Poyser,\r\nwho was panting with fatigue, and secretly resolving that neither judge\r\nnor jury should force her to dance another dance, to take a quiet rest\r\nin the dining-room, where supper was laid out for the guests to come\r\nand take it as they chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve desired Hetty to remember as she\xe2\x80\x99s got to dance wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the good innocent woman; \xe2\x80\x9cfor she\xe2\x80\x99s so thoughtless, she\xe2\x80\x99d be like\r\nenough to go an\xe2\x80\x99 engage herself for ivery dance. So I told her not to\r\npromise too many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, not without a twinge. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sit\r\ndown in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you\r\nwhat you would like best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must\r\nbe paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and\r\nthe country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the\r\nwaving of the hands, went on joyously.\r\n\r\nAt last the time had come for the fourth dance\xe2\x80\x94longed for by the\r\nstrong, grave Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of\r\neighteen; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love;\r\nand Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s hand for more than a transient\r\ngreeting\xe2\x80\x94had never danced with her but once before. His eyes had\r\nfollowed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself, and had taken in\r\ndeeper draughts of love. He thought she behaved so prettily, so\r\nquietly; she did not seem to be flirting at all, she smiled less than\r\nusual; there was almost a sweet sadness about her. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless her!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid inwardly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d make her life a happy \xe2\x80\x99un, if a strong arm to work\r\nfor her, and a heart to love her, could do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from\r\nwork, and drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly\r\npressed against his, till he forgot where he was, and the music and the\r\ntread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of\r\nthe wind, for what he knew.\r\n\r\nBut now the third dance was ended, and he might go up to her and claim\r\nher hand. She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase,\r\nwhispering with Molly, who had just given the sleeping Totty into her\r\narms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing. Mrs.\r\nPoyser had taken the two boys away into the dining-room to give them\r\nsome cake before they went home in the cart with Grandfather and Molly\r\nwas to follow as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hold her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, as Molly turned upstairs; \xe2\x80\x9cthe children\r\nare so heavy when they\xe2\x80\x99re asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was glad of the relief, for to hold Totty in her arms, standing,\r\nwas not at all a pleasant variety to her. But this second transfer had\r\nthe unfortunate effect of rousing Totty, who was not behind any child\r\nof her age in peevishness at an unseasonable awaking. While Hetty was\r\nin the act of placing her in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and had not yet withdrawn her\r\nown, Totty opened her eyes, and forthwith fought out with her left fist\r\nat Adam\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and with her right caught at the string of brown beads\r\nround Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s neck. The locket leaped out from her frock, and the next\r\nmoment the string was broken, and Hetty, helpless, saw beads and locket\r\nscattered wide on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy locket, my locket!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a loud frightened whisper to Adam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnever mind the beads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had already seen where the locket fell, for it had attracted his\r\nglance as it leaped out of her frock. It had fallen on the raised\r\nwooden dais where the band sat, not on the stone floor; and as Adam\r\npicked it up, he saw the glass with the dark and light locks of hair\r\nunder it. It had fallen that side upwards, so the glass was not broken.\r\nHe turned it over on his hand, and saw the enamelled gold back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he held it towards Hetty, who was unable\r\nto take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, who had\r\nbeen pale and was now red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seemed very frightened about it.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold it till you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, quietly closing\r\nhis hand over it, that she might not think he wanted to look at it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBy this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as soon as she\r\nhad taken Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She took it\r\nwith an air of indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart\r\nvexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it, but determined now\r\nthat she would show no more signs of agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re taking their places to dance; let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam assented silently. A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him.\r\nHad Hetty a lover he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know of? For none of her relations, he was\r\nsure, would give her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with\r\nwhom he was acquainted, was in the position of an accepted lover, as\r\nthe giver of that locket must be. Adam was lost in the utter\r\nimpossibility of finding any person for his fears to alight on. He\r\ncould only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s life unknown to him; that while he had been rocking himself in\r\nthe hope that she would come to love him, she was already loving\r\nanother. The pleasure of the dance with Hetty was gone; his eyes, when\r\nthey rested on her, had an uneasy questioning expression in them; he\r\ncould think of nothing to say to her; and she too was out of temper and\r\ndisinclined to speak. They were both glad when the dance was ended.\r\n\r\nAdam was determined to stay no longer; no one wanted him, and no one\r\nwould notice if he slipped away. As soon as he got out of doors, he\r\nbegan to walk at his habitual rapid pace, hurrying along without\r\nknowing why, busy with the painful thought that the memory of this day,\r\nso full of honour and promise to him, was poisoned for ever. Suddenly,\r\nwhen he was far on through the Chase, he stopped, startled by a flash\r\nof reviving hope. After all, he might be a fool, making a great misery\r\nout of a trifle. Hetty, fond of finery as she was, might have bought\r\nthe thing herself. It looked too expensive for that\xe2\x80\x94it looked like the\r\nthings on white satin in the great jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s shop at Rosseter. But\r\nAdam had very imperfect notions of the value of such things, and he\r\nthought it could certainly not cost more than a guinea. Perhaps Hetty\r\nhad had as much as that in Christmas boxes, and there was no knowing\r\nbut she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way; she\r\nwas such a young thing, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help loving finery! But then,\r\nwhy had she been so frightened about it at first, and changed colour\r\nso, and afterwards pretended not to care? Oh, that was because she was\r\nashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thing\xe2\x80\x94she was conscious\r\nthat it was wrong for her to spend her money on it, and she knew that\r\nAdam disapproved of finery. It was a proof she cared about what he\r\nliked and disliked. She must have thought from his silence and gravity\r\nafterwards that he was very much displeased with her, that he was\r\ninclined to be harsh and severe towards her foibles. And as he walked\r\non more quietly, chewing the cud of this new hope, his only uneasiness\r\nwas that he had behaved in a way which might chill Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s feeling\r\ntowards him. For this last view of the matter _must_ be the true one.\r\nHow could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite unknown to him? She was\r\nnever away from her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house for more than a day; she could have\r\nno acquaintances that did not come there, and no intimacies unknown to\r\nher uncle and aunt. It would be folly to believe that the locket was\r\ngiven to her by a lover. The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was\r\nher own; he could form no guess about the light hair under it, for he\r\nhad not seen it very distinctly. It might be a bit of her father\xe2\x80\x99s or\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s, who had died when she was a child, and she would naturally\r\nput a bit of her own along with it.\r\n\r\nAnd so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself an\r\ningenious web of probabilities\xe2\x80\x94the surest screen a wise man can place\r\nbetween himself and the truth. His last waking thoughts melted into a\r\ndream that he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm, and that he was\r\nasking her to forgive him for being so cold and silent.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance\r\nand saying to her in low hurried tones, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be in the wood the day\r\nafter to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d And Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoolish joys and hopes, which had flown away for a little space, scared\r\nby a mere nothing, now all came fluttering back, unconscious of the\r\nreal peril. She was happy for the first time this long day, and wished\r\nthat dance would last for hours. Arthur wished it too; it was the last\r\nweakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never lies with more\r\ndelicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has\r\npersuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her mind\r\nwas filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of to-morrow\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s cheese in consequence of these late hours. Now that Hetty had\r\ndone her duty and danced one dance with the young squire, Mr. Poyser\r\nmust go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them, for it was\r\nhalf-past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his\r\npart that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go, Mrs.\r\nPoyser was resolute on the point, \xe2\x80\x9cmanners or no manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mr. Donnithorne, as she\r\ncame to curtsy and take leave; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should not part with any\r\nof our guests till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are elderly people,\r\nthink of sitting out the dance till then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Your Honour, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right and proper for gentlefolks to stay up\r\nby candlelight\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve got no cheese on their minds. We\xe2\x80\x99re late enough\r\nas it is, an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s no lettin\xe2\x80\x99 the cows know as they mustn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nbe milked so early to-morrow mornin\xe2\x80\x99. So, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll please t\xe2\x80\x99 excuse\r\nus, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take our leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her husband, as they set off in the cart, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 brewin\xe2\x80\x99 day and washin\xe2\x80\x99 day together than one o\xe2\x80\x99 these pleasurin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndays. There\xe2\x80\x99s no work so tirin\xe2\x80\x99 as danglin\xe2\x80\x99 about an\xe2\x80\x99 starin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 not\r\nrightly knowin\xe2\x80\x99 what you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do next; and keepin\xe2\x80\x99 your face i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsmilin\xe2\x80\x99 order like a grocer o\xe2\x80\x99 market-day for fear people shouldna\r\nthink you civil enough. An\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to show for\xe2\x80\x99t when it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a yallow face wi\xe2\x80\x99 eatin\xe2\x80\x99 things as disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who was in his merriest mood, and felt\r\nthat he had had a great day, \xe2\x80\x9ca bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pleasuring\xe2\x80\x99s good for thee\r\nsometimes. An\xe2\x80\x99 thee danc\xe2\x80\x99st as well as any of \xe2\x80\x99em, for I\xe2\x80\x99ll back thee\r\nagainst all the wives i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish for a light foot an\xe2\x80\x99 ankle. An\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nwas a great honour for the young squire to ask thee first\xe2\x80\x94I reckon it\r\nwas because I sat at th\xe2\x80\x99 head o\xe2\x80\x99 the table an\xe2\x80\x99 made the speech. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHetty too\xe2\x80\x94_she_ never had such a partner before\xe2\x80\x94a fine young gentleman\r\nin reg\xe2\x80\x99mentals. It\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you to talk on, Hetty, when you\xe2\x80\x99re an old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94how you danced wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 young squire the day he come o\xe2\x80\x99 age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Fourth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\nA crisis\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was beyond the middle of August\xe2\x80\x94nearly three weeks after the\r\nbirthday feast. The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland\r\ncounty of Loamshire, but the harvest was likely still to be retarded by\r\nthe heavy rains, which were causing inundations and much damage\r\nthroughout the country. From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope\r\nfarmers, on their pleasant uplands and in their brook-watered valleys,\r\nhad not suffered, and as I cannot pretend that they were such\r\nexceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own,\r\nyou will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid\r\nrise in the price of bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in\r\ntheir own corn undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying\r\nwinds flattered this hope.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked\r\nbrighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before. Grand masses of\r\ncloud were hurried across the blue, and the great round hills behind\r\nthe Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows; the sun was hidden\r\nfor a moment, and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy; the\r\nleaves, still green, were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind;\r\naround the farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors; the apples\r\nfell in the orchards; and the stray horses on the green sides of the\r\nlanes and on the common had their manes blown about their faces. And\r\nyet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun\r\nwas shining. A merry day for the children, who ran and shouted to see\r\nif they could top the wind with their voices; and the grown-up people\r\ntoo were in good spirits, inclined to believe in yet finer days, when\r\nthe wind had fallen. If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown\r\nout of the husk and scattered as untimely seed!\r\n\r\nAnd yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man. For if\r\nit be true that Nature at certain moments seems charged with a\r\npresentiment of one individual lot must it not also be true that she\r\nseems unmindful, unconscious of another? For there is no hour that has\r\nnot its births of gladness and despair, no morning brightness that does\r\nnot bring new sickness to desolation as well as new forces to genius\r\nand love. There are so many of us, and our lots are so different, what\r\nwonder that Nature\xe2\x80\x99s mood is often in harsh contrast with the great\r\ncrisis of our lives? We are children of a large family, and must learn,\r\nas such children do, not to expect that our hurts will be made much\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94to be content with little nurture and caressing, and help each other\r\nthe more.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy day with Adam, who of late had done almost double work,\r\nfor he was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan Burge, until some\r\nsatisfactory person could be found to supply his place, and Jonathan\r\nwas slow to find that person. But he had done the extra work\r\ncheerfully, for his hopes were buoyant again about Hetty. Every time\r\nshe had seen him since the birthday, she had seemed to make an effort\r\nto behave all the more kindly to him, that she might make him\r\nunderstand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance.\r\nHe had never mentioned the locket to her again; too happy that she\r\nsmiled at him\xe2\x80\x94still happier because he observed in her a more subdued\r\nair, something that he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness\r\nand seriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nseventeen; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be thoughtful enough after a while. And her aunt\r\nallays says how clever she is at the work. She\xe2\x80\x99ll make a wife as\r\nMother\xe2\x80\x99ll have no occasion to grumble at, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d To be sure, he\r\nhad only seen her at home twice since the birthday; for one Sunday,\r\nwhen he was intending to go from church to the Hall Farm, Hetty had\r\njoined the party of upper servants from the Chase and had gone home\r\nwith them\xe2\x80\x94almost as if she were inclined to encourage Mr. Craig. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 too much likin\xe2\x80\x99 to them folks i\xe2\x80\x99 the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPoyser remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I was never overfond o\xe2\x80\x99 gentlefolks\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly like the fine ladies\xe2\x80\x99 fat dogs, nayther good\r\nfor barking nor butcher\xe2\x80\x99s meat, but on\xe2\x80\x99y for show.\xe2\x80\x9d And another evening\r\nshe was gone to Treddleston to buy some things; though, to his great\r\nsurprise, as he was returning home, he saw her at a distance getting\r\nover a stile quite out of the Treddleston road. But, when he hastened\r\nto her, she was very kind, and asked him to go in again when he had\r\ntaken her to the yard gate. She had gone a little farther into the\r\nfields after coming from Treddleston because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go in,\r\nshe said: it was so nice to be out of doors, and her aunt always made\r\nsuch a fuss about it if she wanted to go out. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do come in with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, as he was going to shake hands with her at the gate, and he\r\ncould not resist that. So he went in, and Mrs. Poyser was contented\r\nwith only a slight remark on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s being later than was expected;\r\nwhile Hetty, who had looked out of spirits when he met her, smiled and\r\ntalked and waited on them all with unusual promptitude.\r\n\r\nThat was the last time he had seen her; but he meant to make leisure\r\nfor going to the Farm to-morrow. To-day, he knew, was her day for going\r\nto the Chase to sew with the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, so he would get as much work\r\ndone as possible this evening, that the next might be clear.\r\n\r\nOne piece of work that Adam was superintending was some slight repairs\r\nat the Chase Farm, which had been hitherto occupied by Satchell, as\r\nbailiff, but which it was now rumoured that the old squire was going to\r\nlet to a smart man in top-boots, who had been seen to ride over it one\r\nday. Nothing but the desire to get a tenant could account for the\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking repairs, though the Saturday-evening party at Mr.\r\nCasson\xe2\x80\x99s agreed over their pipes that no man in his senses would take\r\nthe Chase Farm unless there was a bit more ploughland laid to it.\r\nHowever that might be, the repairs were ordered to be executed with all\r\ndispatch, and Adam, acting for Mr. Burge, was carrying out the order\r\nwith his usual energy. But to-day, having been occupied elsewhere, he\r\nhad not been able to arrive at the Chase Farm till late in the\r\nafternoon, and he then discovered that some old roofing, which he had\r\ncalculated on preserving, had given way. There was clearly no good to\r\nbe done with this part of the building without pulling it all down, and\r\nAdam immediately saw in his mind a plan for building it up again, so as\r\nto make the most convenient of cow-sheds and calf-pens, with a hovel\r\nfor implements; and all without any great expense for materials. So,\r\nwhen the workmen were gone, he sat down, took out his pocket-book, and\r\nbusied himself with sketching a plan, and making a specification of the\r\nexpenses that he might show it to Burge the next morning, and set him\r\non persuading the squire to consent. To \xe2\x80\x9cmake a good job\xe2\x80\x9d of anything,\r\nhowever small, was always a pleasure to Adam, and he sat on a block,\r\nwith his book resting on a planing-table, whistling low every now and\r\nthen and turning his head on one side with a just perceptible smile of\r\ngratification\xe2\x80\x94of pride, too, for if Adam loved a bit of good work, he\r\nloved also to think, \xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d And I believe the only people who are\r\nfree from that weakness are those who have no work to call their own.\r\nIt was nearly seven before he had finished and put on his jacket again;\r\nand on giving a last look round, he observed that Seth, who had been\r\nworking here to-day, had left his basket of tools behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s forgot his tools,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s got to work up at the\r\nshop to-morrow. There never was such a chap for wool-gathering; he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nleave his head behind him, if it was loose. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s lucky I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen \xe2\x80\x99em; I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry \xe2\x80\x99em home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the Chase, at\r\nabout ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walking distance from the Abbey. Adam had come\r\nthither on his pony, intending to ride to the stables and put up his\r\nnag on his way home. At the stables he encountered Mr. Craig, who had\r\ncome to look at the captain\xe2\x80\x99s new horse, on which he was to ride away\r\nthe day after to-morrow; and Mr. Craig detained him to tell how all the\r\nservants were to collect at the gate of the courtyard to wish the young\r\nsquire luck as he rode out; so that by the time Adam had got into the\r\nChase, and was striding along with the basket of tools over his\r\nshoulder, the sun was on the point of setting, and was sending level\r\ncrimson rays among the great trunks of the old oaks, and touching every\r\nbare patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a\r\njewel dropt upon the grass. The wind had fallen now, and there was only\r\nenough breeze to stir the delicate-stemmed leaves. Any one who had been\r\nsitting in the house all day would have been glad to walk now; but Adam\r\nhad been quite enough in the open air to wish to shorten his way home,\r\nand he bethought himself that he might do so by striking across the\r\nChase and going through the Grove, where he had never been for years.\r\nHe hurried on across the Chase, stalking along the narrow paths between\r\nthe fern, with Gyp at his heels, not lingering to watch the magnificent\r\nchanges of the light\xe2\x80\x94hardly once thinking of it\xe2\x80\x94yet feeling its\r\npresence in a certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his busy\r\nworking-day thoughts. How could he help feeling it? The very deer felt\r\nit, and were more timid.\r\n\r\nPresently Adam\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts recurred to what Mr. Craig had said about\r\nArthur Donnithorne, and pictured his going away, and the changes that\r\nmight take place before he came back; then they travelled back\r\naffectionately over the old scenes of boyish companionship, and dwelt\r\non Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities, which Adam had a pride in, as we all have\r\nin the virtues of the superior who honours us. A nature like Adam\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwith a great need of love and reverence in it, depends for so much of\r\nits happiness on what it can believe and feel about others! And he had\r\nno ideal world of dead heroes; he knew little of the life of men in the\r\npast; he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving\r\nadmiration among those who came within speech of him. These pleasant\r\nthoughts about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual into his\r\nkeen rough face: perhaps they were the reason why, when he opened the\r\nold green gate leading into the Grove, he paused to pat Gyp and say a\r\nkind word to him.\r\n\r\nAfter that pause, he strode on again along the broad winding path\r\nthrough the Grove. What grand beeches! Adam delighted in a fine tree of\r\nall things; as the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s sight is keenest on the sea, so Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperceptions were more at home with trees than with other objects. He\r\nkept them in his memory, as a painter does, with all the flecks and\r\nknots in their bark, all the curves and angles of their boughs, and had\r\noften calculated the height and contents of a trunk to a nicety, as he\r\nstood looking at it. No wonder that, not-withstanding his desire to get\r\non, he could not help pausing to look at a curious large beech which he\r\nhad seen standing before him at a turning in the road, and convince\r\nhimself that it was not two trees wedded together, but only one. For\r\nthe rest of his life he remembered that moment when he was calmly\r\nexamining the beech, as a man remembers his last glimpse of the home\r\nwhere his youth was passed, before the road turned, and he saw it no\r\nmore. The beech stood at the last turning before the Grove ended in an\r\narchway of boughs that let in the eastern light; and as Adam stepped\r\naway from the tree to continue his walk, his eyes fell on two figures\r\nabout twenty yards before him.\r\n\r\nHe remained as motionless as a statue, and turned almost as pale. The\r\ntwo figures were standing opposite to each other, with clasped hands\r\nabout to part; and while they were bending to kiss, Gyp, who had been\r\nrunning among the brushwood, came out, caught sight of them, and gave a\r\nsharp bark. They separated with a start\xe2\x80\x94one hurried through the gate\r\nout of the Grove, and the other, turning round, walked slowly, with a\r\nsort of saunter, towards Adam who still stood transfixed and pale,\r\nclutching tighter the stick with which he held the basket of tools over\r\nhis shoulder, and looking at the approaching figure with eyes in which\r\namazement was fast turning to fierceness.\r\n\r\nArthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited; he had tried to make\r\nunpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more wine than\r\nusual at dinner to-day, and was still enough under its flattering\r\ninfluence to think more lightly of this unwished-for rencontre with\r\nAdam than he would otherwise have done. After all, Adam was the best\r\nperson who could have happened to see him and Hetty together\xe2\x80\x94he was a\r\nsensible fellow, and would not babble about it to other people. Arthur\r\nfelt confident that he could laugh the thing off and explain it away.\r\nAnd so he sauntered forward with elaborate carelessness\xe2\x80\x94his flushed\r\nface, his evening dress of fine cloth and fine linen, his hands\r\nhalf-thrust into his waistcoat pockets, all shone upon by the strange\r\nevening light which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith,\r\nand were now shedding down between the topmost branches above him.\r\n\r\nAdam was still motionless, looking at him as he came up. He understood\r\nit all now\xe2\x80\x94the locket and everything else that had been doubtful to\r\nhim: a terrible scorching light showed him the hidden letters that\r\nchanged the meaning of the past. If he had moved a muscle, he must\r\ninevitably have sprung upon Arthur like a tiger; and in the conflicting\r\nemotions that filled those long moments, he had told himself that he\r\nwould not give loose to passion, he would only speak the right thing.\r\nHe stood as if petrified by an unseen force, but the force was his own\r\nstrong will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at the fine old\r\nbeeches, eh? They\xe2\x80\x99re not to be come near by the hatchet, though; this\r\nis a sacred grove. I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was\r\ncoming to my den\xe2\x80\x94the Hermitage, there. She ought not to come home this\r\nway so late. So I took care of her to the gate, and asked for a kiss\r\nfor my pains. But I must get back now, for this road is confoundedly\r\ndamp. Good-night, Adam. I shall see you to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94to say good-bye, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was too much preoccupied with the part he was playing himself to\r\nbe thoroughly aware of the expression in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face. He did not look\r\ndirectly at Adam, but glanced carelessly round at the trees and then\r\nlifted up one foot to look at the sole of his boot. He cared to say no\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94he had thrown quite dust enough into honest Adam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94and as he\r\nspoke the last words, he walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, in a hard peremptory voice, without\r\nturning round. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a word to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur paused in surprise. Susceptible persons are more affected by a\r\nchange of tone than by unexpected words, and Arthur had the\r\nsusceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and vain. He was still\r\nmore surprised when he saw that Adam had not moved, but stood with his\r\nback to him, as if summoning him to return. What did he mean? He was\r\ngoing to make a serious business of this affair. Arthur felt his temper\r\nrising. A patronising disposition always has its meaner side, and in\r\nthe confusion of his irritation and alarm there entered the feeling\r\nthat a man to whom he had shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a\r\nposition to criticize his conduct. And yet he was dominated, as one who\r\nfeels himself in the wrong always is, by the man whose good opinion he\r\ncares for. In spite of pride and temper, there was as much deprecation\r\nas anger in his voice when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, sir\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94answered Adam, in the same harsh voice, still without\r\nturning round\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, sir, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me by your light\r\nwords. This is not the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve met Hetty Sorrel in this\r\ngrove, and this is not the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve kissed her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from\r\nknowledge, and how far from mere inference. And this uncertainty, which\r\nprevented him from contriving a prudent answer, heightened his\r\nirritation. He said, in a high sharp tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, instead of acting like th\xe2\x80\x99 upright, honourable man we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nall believed you to be, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been acting the part of a selfish\r\nlight-minded scoundrel. You know as well as I do what it\xe2\x80\x99s to lead to\r\nwhen a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like\r\nHetty, and gives her presents as she\xe2\x80\x99s frightened for other folks to\r\nsee. And I say it again, you\xe2\x80\x99re acting the part of a selfish\r\nlight-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th\xe2\x80\x99 heart to say so, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather ha\xe2\x80\x99 lost my right hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, bridling his growing anger and\r\ntrying to recur to his careless tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not only devilishly\r\nimpertinent, but you\xe2\x80\x99re talking nonsense. Every pretty girl is not such\r\na fool as you, to suppose that when a gentleman admires her beauty and\r\npays her a little attention, he must mean something particular. Every\r\nman likes to flirt with a pretty girl, and every pretty girl likes to\r\nbe flirted with. The wider the distance between them, the less harm\r\nthere is, for then she\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to deceive herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by flirting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you mean\r\nbehaving to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving her all the\r\nwhile, I say that\xe2\x80\x99s not th\xe2\x80\x99 action of an honest man, and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhonest does come t\xe2\x80\x99 harm. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fool, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not a fool, and\r\nyou know better than what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. You know it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be made\r\npublic as you\xe2\x80\x99ve behaved to Hetty as y\xe2\x80\x99 have done without her losing\r\nher character and bringing shame and trouble on her and her relations.\r\nWhat if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents? Other\r\nfolks won\xe2\x80\x99t believe as you\xe2\x80\x99ve meant nothing; and don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about\r\nher not deceiving herself. I tell you as you\xe2\x80\x99ve filled her mind so with\r\nthe thought of you as it\xe2\x80\x99ll mayhap poison her life, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nlove another man as \xe2\x80\x99ud make her a good husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he perceived\r\nthat Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and that there was no\r\nirrevocable damage done by this evening\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate rencontre. Adam\r\ncould still be deceived. The candid Arthur had brought himself into a\r\nposition in which successful lying was his only hope. The hope allayed\r\nhis anger a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of friendly concession, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nperhaps right. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone a little too far in taking notice of\r\nthe pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You\xe2\x80\x99re such a\r\ngrave, steady fellow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the temptation to such\r\ntrifling. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any trouble or annoyance on her and\r\nthe good Poysers on any account if I could help it. But I think you\r\nlook a little too seriously at it. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m going away immediately,\r\nso I shan\xe2\x80\x99t make any more mistakes of the kind. But let us say\r\ngood-night\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Arthur here turned round to walk on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand talk no more about\r\nthe matter. The whole thing will soon be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam burst out with rage that could be controlled no\r\nlonger, throwing down the basket of tools and striding forward till he\r\nwas right in front of Arthur. All his jealousy and sense of personal\r\ninjury, which he had been hitherto trying to keep under, had leaped up\r\nand mastered him. What man of us, in the first moments of a sharp\r\nagony, could ever feel that the fellow-man who has been the medium of\r\ninflicting it did not mean to hurt us? In our instinctive rebellion\r\nagainst pain, we are children again, and demand an active will to wreak\r\nour vengeance on. Adam at this moment could only feel that he had been\r\nrobbed of Hetty\xe2\x80\x94robbed treacherously by the man in whom he had\r\ntrusted\xe2\x80\x94and he stood close in front of Arthur, with fierce eyes glaring\r\nat him, with pale lips and clenched hands, the hard tones in which he\r\nhad hitherto been constraining himself to express no more than a just\r\nindignation giving way to a deep agitated voice that seemed to shake\r\nhim as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99ll not be soon forgot, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve come in between her and me,\r\nwhen she might ha\xe2\x80\x99 loved me\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll not soon be forgot as you\xe2\x80\x99ve robbed\r\nme o\xe2\x80\x99 my happiness, while I thought you was my best friend, and a\r\nnoble-minded man, as I was proud to work for. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been kissing\r\nher, and meaning nothing, have you? And I never kissed her i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 worked hard for years for the right to kiss her. And\r\nyou make light of it. You think little o\xe2\x80\x99 doing what may damage other\r\nfolks, so as you get your bit o\xe2\x80\x99 trifling, as means nothing. I throw\r\nback your favours, for you\xe2\x80\x99re not the man I took you for. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ncount you my friend any more. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you\xe2\x80\x99d act as my enemy, and\r\nfight me where I stand\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all th\xe2\x80\x99 amends you can make me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Adam, possessed by rage that could find no other vent, began to\r\nthrow off his coat and his cap, too blind with passion to notice the\r\nchange that had taken place in Arthur while he was speaking. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips were now as pale as Adam\xe2\x80\x99s; his heart was beating violently. The\r\ndiscovery that Adam loved Hetty was a shock which made him for the\r\nmoment see himself in the light of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s indignation, and regard\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s suffering as not merely a consequence, but an element of his\r\nerror. The words of hatred and contempt\xe2\x80\x94the first he had ever heard in\r\nhis life\xe2\x80\x94seemed like scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable\r\nscars on him. All screening self-excuse, which rarely falls quite away\r\nwhile others respect us, forsook him for an instant, and he stood face\r\nto face with the first great irrevocable evil he had ever committed. He\r\nwas only twenty-one, and three months ago\xe2\x80\x94nay, much later\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nthought proudly that no man should ever be able to reproach him justly.\r\nHis first impulse, if there had been time for it, would perhaps have\r\nbeen to utter words of propitiation; but Adam had no sooner thrown off\r\nhis coat and cap than he became aware that Arthur was standing pale and\r\nmotionless, with his hands still thrust in his waistcoat pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you fight me like a man? You know I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstrike you while you stand so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fight you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fight me\xe2\x80\x94you think I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ncommon man, as you can injure without answering for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never meant to injure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, with returning anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know you loved her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve made her love _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a double-faced\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe a word you say again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cor we shall both repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, with a convulsed voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear I won\xe2\x80\x99t go away\r\nwithout fighting you. Do you want provoking any more? I tell you you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na coward and a scoundrel, and I despise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour had all rushed back to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s face; in a moment his right\r\nhand was clenched, and dealt a blow like lightning, which sent Adam\r\nstaggering backward. His blood was as thoroughly up as Adam\xe2\x80\x99s now, and\r\nthe two men, forgetting the emotions that had gone before, fought with\r\nthe instinctive fierceness of panthers in the deepening twilight\r\ndarkened by the trees. The delicate-handed gentleman was a match for\r\nthe workman in everything but strength, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s skill enabled him\r\nto protract the struggle for some long moments. But between unarmed men\r\nthe battle is to the strong, where the strong is no blunderer, and\r\nArthur must sink under a well-planted blow of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s as a steel rod is\r\nbroken by an iron bar. The blow soon came, and Arthur fell, his head\r\nlying concealed in a tuft of fern, so that Adam could only discern his\r\ndarkly clad body.\r\n\r\nHe stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise.\r\n\r\nThe blow had been given now, towards which he had been straining all\r\nthe force of nerve and muscle\xe2\x80\x94and what was the good of it? What had he\r\ndone by fighting? Only satisfied his own passion, only wreaked his own\r\nvengeance. He had not rescued Hetty, nor changed the past\xe2\x80\x94there it was,\r\njust as it had been, and he sickened at the vanity of his own rage.\r\n\r\nBut why did not Arthur rise? He was perfectly motionless, and the time\r\nseemed long to Adam. Good God! had the blow been too much for him? Adam\r\nshuddered at the thought of his own strength, as with the oncoming of\r\nthis dread he knelt down by Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s side and lifted his head from\r\namong the fern. There was no sign of life: the eyes and teeth were set.\r\nThe horror that rushed over Adam completely mastered him, and forced\r\nupon him its own belief. He could feel nothing but that death was in\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s face, and that he was helpless before it. He made not a single\r\nmovement, but knelt like an image of despair gazing at an image of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\nA Dilemma\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only a few minutes measured by the clock\xe2\x80\x94though Adam always\r\nthought it had been a long while\xe2\x80\x94before he perceived a gleam of\r\nconsciousness in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s face and a slight shiver through his frame.\r\nThe intense joy that flooded his soul brought back some of the old\r\naffection with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any pain, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tenderly, loosening Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncravat.\r\n\r\nArthur turned his eyes on Adam with a vague stare which gave way to a\r\nslightly startled motion as if from the shock of returning memory. But\r\nhe only shivered again and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any hurt, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said again, with a trembling in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nArthur put his hand up to his waistcoat buttons, and when Adam had\r\nunbuttoned it, he took a longer breath. \xe2\x80\x9cLay my head down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nfaintly, \xe2\x80\x9cand get me some water if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam laid the head down gently on the fern again, and emptying the\r\ntools out of the flag-basket, hurried through the trees to the edge of\r\nthe Grove bordering on the Chase, where a brook ran below the bank.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with his basket leaking, but still half-full, Arthur\r\nlooked at him with a more thoroughly reawakened consciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you drink a drop out o\xe2\x80\x99 your hand, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, kneeling down\r\nagain to lift up Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cdip my cravat in and souse it on my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe water seemed to do him some good, for he presently raised himself a\r\nlittle higher, resting on Adam\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any hurt inside sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam asked again\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, still faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut rather done up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a while he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I fainted away when you knocked me\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You thought you\xe2\x80\x99d done for me, eh? Come help me on my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel terribly shaky and dizzy,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said, as he stood leaning on\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s arm; \xe2\x80\x9cthat blow of yours must have come against me like a\r\nbattering-ram. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I can walk alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLean on me, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you along,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cOr, will you sit\r\ndown a bit longer, on my coat here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll prop y\xe2\x80\x99 up. You\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps\r\nbe better in a minute or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Hermitage\xe2\x80\x94I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some\r\nbrandy there. There\xe2\x80\x99s a short road to it a little farther on, near the\r\ngate. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll just help me on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, with frequent pauses, but without speaking again.\r\nIn both of them, the concentration in the present which had attended\r\nthe first moments of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s revival had now given way to a vivid\r\nrecollection of the previous scene. It was nearly dark in the narrow\r\npath among the trees, but within the circle of fir-trees round the\r\nHermitage there was room for the growing moonlight to enter in at the\r\nwindows. Their steps were noiseless on the thick carpet of fir-needles,\r\nand the outward stillness seemed to heighten their inward\r\nconsciousness, as Arthur took the key out of his pocket and placed it\r\nin Adam\xe2\x80\x99s hand, for him to open the door. Adam had not known before\r\nthat Arthur had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for\r\nhimself, and it was a surprise to him when he opened the door to see a\r\nsnug room with all the signs of frequent habitation.\r\n\r\nArthur loosed Adam\xe2\x80\x99s arm and threw himself on the ottoman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nmy hunting-bottle somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA leather case with a bottle\r\nand glass in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was not long in finding the case. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little brandy in\r\nit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning it downwards over the glass, as he held it\r\nbefore the window; \xe2\x80\x9chardly this little glassful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, with the peevishness of physical\r\ndepression. When he had taken some sips, Adam said, \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better\r\nrun to th\xe2\x80\x99 house, sir, and get some more brandy? I can be there and\r\nback pretty soon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a stiff walk home for you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nsomething to revive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94go. But don\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m ill. Ask for my man Pym, and tell him to get\r\nit from Mills, and not to say I\xe2\x80\x99m at the Hermitage. Get some water\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was relieved to have an active task\xe2\x80\x94both of them were relieved to\r\nbe apart from each other for a short time. But Adam\xe2\x80\x99s swift pace could\r\nnot still the eager pain of thinking\xe2\x80\x94of living again with concentrated\r\nsuffering through the last wretched hour, and looking out from it over\r\nall the new sad future.\r\n\r\nArthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone, but presently he\r\nrose feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly in the broken\r\nmoonlight, seeking something. It was a short bit of wax candle that\r\nstood amongst a confusion of writing and drawing materials. There was\r\nmore searching for the means of lighting the candle, and when that was\r\ndone, he went cautiously round the room, as if wishing to assure\r\nhimself of the presence or absence of something. At last he had found a\r\nslight thing, which he put first in his pocket, and then, on a second\r\nthought, took out again and thrust deep down into a waste-paper basket.\r\nIt was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s little, pink, silk neckerchief. He set the candle on\r\nthe table, and threw himself down on the ottoman again, exhausted with\r\nthe effort.\r\n\r\nWhen Adam came back with his supplies, his entrance awoke Arthur from a\r\ndoze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tremendously in want of some\r\nbrandy-vigour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a light, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthinking I\xe2\x80\x99d better have asked for a lanthorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; the candle will last long enough\xe2\x80\x94I shall soon be up to walking\r\nhome now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go before I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you safe home, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam,\r\nhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: it will be better for you to stay\xe2\x80\x94sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam sat down, and they remained opposite to each other in uneasy\r\nsilence, while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with visibly\r\nrenovating effect. He began to lie in a more voluntary position, and\r\nlooked as if he were less overpowered by bodily sensations. Adam was\r\nkeenly alive to these indications, and as his anxiety about Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncondition began to be allayed, he felt more of that impatience which\r\nevery one knows who has had his just indignation suspended by the\r\nphysical state of the culprit. Yet there was one thing on his mind to\r\nbe done before he could recur to remonstrance: it was to confess what\r\nhad been unjust in his own words. Perhaps he longed all the more to\r\nmake this confession, that his indignation might be free again; and as\r\nhe saw the signs of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again\r\ncame to his lips and went back, checked by the thought that it would be\r\nbetter to leave everything till to-morrow. As long as they were silent\r\nthey did not look at each other, and a foreboding came across Adam that\r\nif they began to speak as though they remembered the past\xe2\x80\x94if they\r\nlooked at each other with full recognition\xe2\x80\x94they must take fire again.\r\nSo they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle flickered low in the\r\nsocket, the silence all the while becoming more irksome to Adam. Arthur\r\nhad just poured out some more brandy-and-water, and he threw one arm\r\nbehind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease,\r\nwhich was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou begin to feel more yourself again, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as the candle\r\nwent out and they were half-hidden from each other in the faint\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel good for much\xe2\x80\x94very lazy, and not inclined to move;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home when I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken this dose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause before Adam said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy temper got the better of\r\nme, and I said things as wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true. I\xe2\x80\x99d no right to speak as if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nknown you was doing me an injury: you\xe2\x80\x99d no grounds for knowing it; I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways kept what I felt for her as secret as I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again before he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps I judged you too harsh\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m apt to be harsh\xe2\x80\x94and you may\r\nhave acted out o\xe2\x80\x99 thoughtlessness more than I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 believed was\r\npossible for a man with a heart and a conscience. We\xe2\x80\x99re not all put\r\ntogether alike, and we may misjudge one another. God knows, it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthe joy I could have now, to think the best of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur wanted to go home without saying any more\xe2\x80\x94he was too painfully\r\nembarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to wish for any\r\nfurther explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to him that Adam\r\nreopened the subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer.\r\nArthur was in the wretched position of an open, generous man who has\r\ncommitted an error which makes deception seem a necessity. The native\r\nimpulse to give truth in return for truth, to meet trust with frank\r\nconfession, must be suppressed, and duty was becoming a question of\r\ntactics. His deed was reacting upon him\xe2\x80\x94was already governing him\r\ntyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual\r\nfeelings. The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive\r\nAdam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him than he deserved.\r\nAnd when he heard the words of honest retractation\xe2\x80\x94when he heard the\r\nsad appeal with which Adam ended\xe2\x80\x94he was obliged to rejoice in the\r\nremains of ignorant confidence it implied. He did not answer\r\nimmediately, for he had to be judicious and not truthful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more about our anger, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last, very languidly,\r\nfor the labour of speech was unwelcome to him; \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive your\r\nmomentary injustice\xe2\x80\x94it was quite natural, with the exaggerated notions\r\nyou had in your mind. We shall be none the worse friends in future, I\r\nhope, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve fought. You had the best of it, and that was as it\r\nshould be, for I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve been most in the wrong of the two. Come,\r\nlet us shake hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur held out his hand, but Adam sat still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 to that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t shake\r\nhands till it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what we mean by\xe2\x80\x99t. I was wrong when I spoke as if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d done me an injury knowingly, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wrong in what I said\r\nbefore, about your behaviour t\xe2\x80\x99 Hetty, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t shake hands with you\r\nas if I held you my friend the same as ever till you\xe2\x80\x99ve cleared that up\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur swallowed his pride and resentment as he drew back his hand. He\r\nwas silent for some moments, and then said, as indifferently as he\r\ncould, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by clearing up, Adam. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you\r\nalready that you think too seriously of a little flirtation. But if you\r\nare right in supposing there is any danger in it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going away on\r\nSaturday, and there will be an end of it. As for the pain it has given\r\nyou, I\xe2\x80\x99m heartily sorry for it. I can say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam said nothing, but rose from his chair and stood with his face\r\ntowards one of the windows, as if looking at the blackness of the\r\nmoonlit fir-trees; but he was in reality conscious of nothing but the\r\nconflict within him. It was of no use now\xe2\x80\x94his resolution not to speak\r\ntill to-morrow. He must speak there and then. But it was several\r\nminutes before he turned round and stepped nearer to Arthur, standing\r\nand looking down on him as he lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be better for me to speak plain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with evident effort,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough it\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. You see, sir, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a trifle to me,\r\nwhatever it may be to you. I\xe2\x80\x99m none o\xe2\x80\x99 them men as can go making love\r\nfirst to one woman and then t\xe2\x80\x99 another, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think it much odds\r\nwhich of \xe2\x80\x99em I take. What I feel for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99 love,\r\nsuch as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and\r\nGod as has given it to \xe2\x80\x99em. She\xe2\x80\x99s more nor everything else to me, all\r\nbut my conscience and my good name. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s true what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsaying all along\xe2\x80\x94and if it\xe2\x80\x99s only been trifling and flirting as you\r\ncall it, as \xe2\x80\x99ll be put an end to by your going away\xe2\x80\x94why, then, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwait, and hope her heart \xe2\x80\x99ud turn to me after all. I\xe2\x80\x99m loath to think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d speak false to me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe your word, however things may\r\nlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArthur, almost violently, starting up from the ottoman and moving away.\r\nBut he threw himself into a chair again directly, saying, more feebly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to forget that, in suspecting me, you are casting imputations\r\nupon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, in a calmer voice, as if he were\r\nhalf-relieved\xe2\x80\x94for he was too straightforward to make a distinction\r\nbetween a direct falsehood and an indirect one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, things don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlie level between Hetty and you. You\xe2\x80\x99re acting with your eyes open,\r\nwhatever you may do; but how do you know what\xe2\x80\x99s been in her mind? She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall but a child\xe2\x80\x94as any man with a conscience in him ought to feel bound\r\nto take care on. And whatever you may think, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve disturbed\r\nher mind. I know she\xe2\x80\x99s been fixing her heart on you, for there\xe2\x80\x99s a many\r\nthings clear to me now as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand before. But you seem to\r\nmake light o\xe2\x80\x99 what _she_ may feel\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, Adam, let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur burst out impetuously; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel\r\nit enough without your worrying me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was aware of his indiscretion as soon as the words had escaped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you feel it,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam rejoined, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cif you feel as\r\nyou may ha\xe2\x80\x99 put false notions into her mind, and made her believe as\r\nyou loved her, when all the while you meant nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99ve this demand\r\nto make of you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not speaking for myself, but for her. I ask you t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nundeceive her before you go away. Y\xe2\x80\x99aren\xe2\x80\x99t going away for ever, and if\r\nyou leave her behind with a notion in her head o\xe2\x80\x99 your feeling about\r\nher the same as she feels about you, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be hankering after you, and\r\nthe mischief may get worse. It may be a smart to her now, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsave her pain i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 end. I ask you to write a letter\xe2\x80\x94you may trust to\r\nmy seeing as she gets it. Tell her the truth, and take blame to\r\nyourself for behaving as you\xe2\x80\x99d no right to do to a young woman as isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyour equal. I speak plain, sir, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak any other way.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody can take care o\xe2\x80\x99 Hetty in this thing but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do what I think needful in the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, more and\r\nmore irritated by mingled distress and perplexity, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout giving\r\npromises to you. I shall take what measures I think proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, in an abrupt decided tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I must know\r\nwhat ground I\xe2\x80\x99m treading on. I must be safe as you\xe2\x80\x99ve put an end to\r\nwhat ought never to ha\xe2\x80\x99 been begun. I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget what\xe2\x80\x99s owing to you\r\nas a gentleman, but in this thing we\xe2\x80\x99re man and man, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer for some moments. Then Arthur said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\r\nto-morrow. I can bear no more now; I\xe2\x80\x99m ill.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose as he spoke, and\r\nreached his cap, as if intending to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t see her again!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam exclaimed, with a flash of recurring\r\nanger and suspicion, moving towards the door and placing his back\r\nagainst it. \xe2\x80\x9cEither tell me she can never be my wife\xe2\x80\x94tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen lying\xe2\x80\x94or else promise me what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, uttering this alternative, stood like a terrible fate before\r\nArthur, who had moved forward a step or two, and now stopped, faint,\r\nshaken, sick in mind and body. It seemed long to both of them\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ninward struggle of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94before he said, feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cI promise; let me\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam moved away from the door and opened it, but when Arthur reached\r\nthe step, he stopped again and leaned against the door-post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not well enough to walk alone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur made no answer, and presently walked on, Adam following. But,\r\nafter a few steps, he stood still again, and said, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\r\nmust trouble you. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting late now, and there may be an alarm set\r\nup about me at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam gave his arm, and they walked on without uttering a word, till\r\nthey came where the basket and the tools lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must pick up the tools, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re my brother\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\ndoubt they\xe2\x80\x99ll be rusted. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll please to wait a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur stood still without speaking, and no other word passed between\r\nthem till they were at the side entrance, where he hoped to get in\r\nwithout being seen by any one. He said then, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you; I needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrouble you any further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time will it be conven\xe2\x80\x99ent for me to see you to-morrow, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may send me word that you\xe2\x80\x99re here at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. But he heard no reply; Arthur had turned\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\nThe Next Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur did not pass a sleepless night; he slept long and well. For\r\nsleep comes to the perplexed\xe2\x80\x94if the perplexed are only weary enough.\r\nBut at seven he rang his bell and astonished Pym by declaring he was\r\ngoing to get up, and must have breakfast brought to him at eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd see that my mare is saddled at half-past eight, and tell my\r\ngrandfather when he\xe2\x80\x99s down that I\xe2\x80\x99m better this morning and am gone for\r\na ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been awake an hour, and could rest in bed no longer. In bed our\r\nyesterdays are too oppressive: if a man can only get up, though it be\r\nbut to whistle or to smoke, he has a present which offers some\r\nresistance to the past\xe2\x80\x94sensations which assert themselves against\r\ntyrannous memories. And if there were such a thing as taking averages\r\nof feeling, it would certainly be found that in the hunting and\r\nshooting seasons regret, self-reproach, and mortified pride weigh\r\nlighter on country gentlemen than in late spring and summer. Arthur\r\nfelt that he should be more of a man on horseback. Even the presence of\r\nPym, waiting on him with the usual deference, was a reassurance to him\r\nafter the scenes of yesterday. For, with Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sensitiveness to\r\nopinion, the loss of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s respect was a shock to his self-contentment\r\nwhich suffused his imagination with the sense that he had sunk in all\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94as a sudden shock of fear from some real peril makes a nervous\r\nwoman afraid even to step, because all her perceptions are suffused\r\nwith a sense of danger.\r\n\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s, as you know, was a loving nature. Deeds of kindness were as\r\neasy to him as a bad habit: they were the common issue of his\r\nweaknesses and good qualities, of his egoism and his sympathy. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like to witness pain, and he liked to have grateful eyes beaming\r\non him as the giver of pleasure. When he was a lad of seven, he one day\r\nkicked down an old gardener\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher of broth, from no motive but a\r\nkicking impulse, not reflecting that it was the old man\xe2\x80\x99s dinner; but\r\non learning that sad fact, he took his favourite pencil-case and a\r\nsilver-hafted knife out of his pocket and offered them as compensation.\r\nHe had been the same Arthur ever since, trying to make all offences\r\nforgotten in benefits. If there were any bitterness in his nature, it\r\ncould only show itself against the man who refused to be conciliated by\r\nhim. And perhaps the time was come for some of that bitterness to rise.\r\nAt the first moment, Arthur had felt pure distress and self-reproach at\r\ndiscovering that Adam\xe2\x80\x99s happiness was involved in his relation to\r\nHetty. If there had been a possibility of making Adam tenfold amends\xe2\x80\x94if\r\ndeeds of gift, or any other deeds, could have restored Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontentment and regard for him as a benefactor, Arthur would not only\r\nhave executed them without hesitation, but would have felt bound all\r\nthe more closely to Adam, and would never have been weary of making\r\nretribution. But Adam could receive no amends; his suffering could not\r\nbe cancelled; his respect and affection could not be recovered by any\r\nprompt deeds of atonement. He stood like an immovable obstacle against\r\nwhich no pressure could avail; an embodiment of what Arthur most shrank\r\nfrom believing in\xe2\x80\x94the irrevocableness of his own wrongdoing. The words\r\nof scorn, the refusal to shake hands, the mastery asserted over him in\r\ntheir last conversation in the Hermitage\xe2\x80\x94above all, the sense of having\r\nbeen knocked down, to which a man does not very well reconcile himself,\r\neven under the most heroic circumstances\xe2\x80\x94pressed on him with a galling\r\npain which was stronger than compunction. Arthur would so gladly have\r\npersuaded himself that he had done no harm! And if no one had told him\r\nthe contrary, he could have persuaded himself so much better. Nemesis\r\ncan seldom forge a sword for herself out of our consciences\xe2\x80\x94out of the\r\nsuffering we feel in the suffering we may have caused: there is rarely\r\nmetal enough there to make an effective weapon. Our moral sense learns\r\nthe manners of good society and smiles when others smile, but when some\r\nrude person gives rough names to our actions, she is apt to take part\r\nagainst us. And so it was with Arthur: Adam\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of him, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrating words, disturbed his self-soothing arguments.\r\n\r\nNot that Arthur had been at ease before Adam\xe2\x80\x99s discovery. Struggles and\r\nresolves had transformed themselves into compunction and anxiety. He\r\nwas distressed for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and distressed for his own, that he\r\nmust leave her behind. He had always, both in making and breaking\r\nresolutions, looked beyond his passion and seen that it must speedily\r\nend in separation; but his nature was too ardent and tender for him not\r\nto suffer at this parting; and on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s account he was filled with\r\nuneasiness. He had found out the dream in which she was living\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nwas to be a lady in silks and satins\xe2\x80\x94and when he had first talked to\r\nher about his going away, she had asked him tremblingly to let her go\r\nwith him and be married. It was his painful knowledge of this which had\r\ngiven the most exasperating sting to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s reproaches. He had said no\r\nword with the purpose of deceiving her\xe2\x80\x94her vision was all spun by her\r\nown childish fancy\xe2\x80\x94but he was obliged to confess to himself that it was\r\nspun half out of his own actions. And to increase the mischief, on this\r\nlast evening he had not dared to hint the truth to Hetty; he had been\r\nobliged to soothe her with tender, hopeful words, lest he should throw\r\nher into violent distress. He felt the situation acutely, felt the\r\nsorrow of the dear thing in the present, and thought with a darker\r\nanxiety of the tenacity which her feelings might have in the future.\r\nThat was the one sharp point which pressed against him; every other he\r\ncould evade by hopeful self-persuasion. The whole thing had been\r\nsecret; the Poysers had not the shadow of a suspicion. No one, except\r\nAdam, knew anything of what had passed\xe2\x80\x94no one else was likely to know;\r\nfor Arthur had impressed on Hetty that it would be fatal to betray, by\r\nword or look, that there had been the least intimacy between them; and\r\nAdam, who knew half their secret, would rather help them to keep it\r\nthan betray it. It was an unfortunate business altogether, but there\r\nwas no use in making it worse than it was by imaginary exaggerations\r\nand forebodings of evil that might never come. The temporary sadness\r\nfor Hetty was the worst consequence; he resolutely turned away his eyes\r\nfrom any bad consequence that was not demonstrably inevitable. But\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nHetty might have had the trouble in some other way if not in this. And\r\nperhaps hereafter he might be able to do a great deal for her and make\r\nup to her for all the tears she would shed about him. She would owe the\r\nadvantage of his care for her in future years to the sorrow she had\r\nincurred now. _So_ good comes out of evil. Such is the beautiful\r\narrangement of things!\r\n\r\nAre you inclined to ask whether this can be the same Arthur who, two\r\nmonths ago, had that freshness of feeling, that delicate honour which\r\nshrinks from wounding even a sentiment, and does not contemplate any\r\nmore positive offence as possible for it?\xe2\x80\x94who thought that his own\r\nself-respect was a higher tribunal than any external opinion? The same,\r\nI assure you, only under different conditions. Our deeds determine us,\r\nas much as we determine our deeds, and until we know what has been or\r\nwill be the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts, which\r\nconstitutes a man\xe2\x80\x99s critical actions, it will be better not to think\r\nourselves wise about his character. There is a terrible coercion in our\r\ndeeds, which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then\r\nreconcile him to the change, for this reason\xe2\x80\x94that the second wrong\r\npresents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right. The\r\naction which before commission has been seen with that blended common\r\nsense and fresh untarnished feeling which is the healthy eye of the\r\nsoul, is looked at afterwards with the lens of apologetic ingenuity,\r\nthrough which all things that men call beautiful and ugly are seen to\r\nbe made up of textures very much alike. Europe adjusts itself to a\r\n_fait accompli_, and so does an individual character\xe2\x80\x94until the placid\r\nadjustment is disturbed by a convulsive retribution.\r\n\r\nNo man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his own\r\nsentiment of right, and the effect was the stronger in Arthur because\r\nof that very need of self-respect which, while his conscience was still\r\nat ease, was one of his best safeguards. Self-accusation was too\r\npainful to him\xe2\x80\x94he could not face it. He must persuade himself that he\r\nhad not been very much to blame; he began even to pity himself for the\r\nnecessity he was under of deceiving Adam\xe2\x80\x94it was a course so opposed to\r\nthe honesty of his own nature. But then, it was the only right thing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nWell, whatever had been amiss in him, he was miserable enough in\r\nconsequence: miserable about Hetty; miserable about this letter that he\r\nhad promised to write, and that seemed at one moment to be a gross\r\nbarbarity, at another perhaps the greatest kindness he could do to her.\r\nAnd across all this reflection would dart every now and then a sudden\r\nimpulse of passionate defiance towards all consequences. He would carry\r\nHetty away, and all other considerations might go to....\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind the four walls of his room made an intolerable\r\nprison to him; they seemed to hem in and press down upon him all the\r\ncrowd of contradictory thoughts and conflicting feelings, some of which\r\nwould fly away in the open air. He had only an hour or two to make up\r\nhis mind in, and he must get clear and calm. Once on Meg\xe2\x80\x99s back, in the\r\nfresh air of that fine morning, he should be more master of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe pretty creature arched her bay neck in the sunshine, and pawed the\r\ngravel, and trembled with pleasure when her master stroked her nose,\r\nand patted her, and talked to her even in a more caressing tone than\r\nusual. He loved her the better because she knew nothing of his secrets.\r\nBut Meg was quite as well acquainted with her master\xe2\x80\x99s mental state as\r\nmany others of her sex with the mental condition of the nice young\r\ngentlemen towards whom their hearts are in a state of fluttering\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nArthur cantered for five miles beyond the Chase, till he was at the\r\nfoot of a hill where there were no hedges or trees to hem in the road.\r\nThen he threw the bridle on Meg\xe2\x80\x99s neck and prepared to make up his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before Arthur\r\nwent away\xe2\x80\x94there was no possibility of their contriving another without\r\nexciting suspicion\xe2\x80\x94and she was like a frightened child, unable to think\r\nof anything, only able to cry at the mention of parting, and then put\r\nher face up to have the tears kissed away. He _could_ do nothing but\r\ncomfort her, and lull her into dreaming on. A letter would be a\r\ndreadfully abrupt way of awakening her! Yet there was truth in what\r\nAdam said\xe2\x80\x94that it would save her from a lengthened delusion, which\r\nmight be worse than a sharp immediate pain. And it was the only way of\r\nsatisfying Adam, who _must_ be satisfied, for more reasons than one. If\r\nhe could have seen her again! But that was impossible; there was such a\r\nthorny hedge of hindrances between them, and an imprudence would be\r\nfatal. And yet, if he _could_ see her again, what good would it do?\r\nOnly cause him to suffer more from the sight of her distress and the\r\nremembrance of it. Away from him she was surrounded by all the motives\r\nto self-control.\r\n\r\nA sudden dread here fell like a shadow across his imagination\xe2\x80\x94the dread\r\nlest she should do something violent in her grief; and close upon that\r\ndread came another, which deepened the shadow. But he shook them off\r\nwith the force of youth and hope. What was the ground for painting the\r\nfuture in that dark way? It was just as likely to be the reverse.\r\nArthur told himself he did not deserve that things should turn out\r\nbadly. He had never meant beforehand to do anything his conscience\r\ndisapproved; he had been led on by circumstances. There was a sort of\r\nimplicit confidence in him that he was really such a good fellow at\r\nbottom, Providence would not treat him harshly.\r\n\r\nAt all events, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help what would come now: all he could do\r\nwas to take what seemed the best course at the present moment. And he\r\npersuaded himself that that course was to make the way open between\r\nAdam and Hetty. Her heart might really turn to Adam, as he said, after\r\na while; and in that case there would have been no great harm done,\r\nsince it was still Adam\xe2\x80\x99s ardent wish to make her his wife. To be sure,\r\nAdam was deceived\xe2\x80\x94deceived in a way that Arthur would have resented as\r\na deep wrong if it had been practised on himself. That was a reflection\r\nthat marred the consoling prospect. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks even burned in\r\nmingled shame and irritation at the thought. But what could a man do in\r\nsuch a dilemma? He was bound in honour to say no word that could injure\r\nHetty: his first duty was to guard _her_. He would never have told or\r\nacted a lie on his own account. Good God! What a miserable fool he was\r\nto have brought himself into such a dilemma; and yet, if ever a man had\r\nexcuses, he had. (Pity that consequences are determined not by excuses\r\nbut by actions!)\r\n\r\nWell, the letter must be written; it was the only means that promised a\r\nsolution of the difficulty. The tears came into Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as he\r\nthought of Hetty reading it; but it would be almost as hard for him to\r\nwrite it; he was not doing anything easy to himself; and this last\r\nthought helped him to arrive at a conclusion. He could never\r\ndeliberately have taken a step which inflicted pain on another and left\r\nhimself at ease. Even a movement of jealousy at the thought of giving\r\nup Hetty to Adam went to convince him that he was making a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWhen once he had come to this conclusion, he turned Meg round and set\r\noff home again in a canter. The letter should be written the first\r\nthing, and the rest of the day would be filled up with other business:\r\nhe should have no time to look behind him. Happily, Irwine and Gawaine\r\nwere coming to dinner, and by twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next day he should\r\nhave left the Chase miles behind him. There was some security in this\r\nconstant occupation against an uncontrollable impulse seizing him to\r\nrush to Hetty and thrust into her hand some mad proposition that would\r\nundo everything. Faster and faster went the sensitive Meg, at every\r\nslight sign from her rider, till the canter had passed into a swift\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they said th\xe2\x80\x99 young mester war took ill last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nsour old John, the groom, at dinner-time in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen ridin\xe2\x80\x99 fit to split the mare i\xe2\x80\x99 two this forenoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s happen one o\xe2\x80\x99 the symptims, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said the facetious coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I wish he war let blood for \xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, grimly.\r\n\r\nAdam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was, and had been\r\nrelieved from all anxiety about the effects of his blow by learning\r\nthat he was gone out for a ride. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock he was punctually\r\nthere again, and sent up word of his arrival. In a few minutes Pym came\r\ndown with a letter in his hand and gave it to Adam, saying that the\r\ncaptain was too busy to see him, and had written everything he had to\r\nsay. The letter was directed to Adam, but he went out of doors again\r\nbefore opening it. It contained a sealed enclosure directed to Hetty.\r\nOn the inside of the cover Adam read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish. I leave it\r\nto you to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it to Hetty\r\nor to return it to me. Ask yourself once more whether you are not\r\ntaking a measure which may pain her more than mere silence.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for our seeing each other again now. We shall\r\n    meet with better feelings some months hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA.D.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 right on \xe2\x80\x99t not to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nuse meeting to say more hard words, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use meeting to shake\r\nhands and say we\xe2\x80\x99re friends again. We\xe2\x80\x99re not friends, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nnot to pretend it. I know forgiveness is a man\xe2\x80\x99s duty, but, to my\r\nthinking, that can only mean as you\xe2\x80\x99re to give up all thoughts o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntaking revenge: it can never mean as you\xe2\x80\x99re t\xe2\x80\x99 have your old feelings\r\nback again, for that\xe2\x80\x99s not possible. He\xe2\x80\x99s not the same man to me, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t _feel_ the same towards him. God help me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I\r\nfeel the same towards anybody: I seem as if I\xe2\x80\x99d been measuring my work\r\nfrom a false line, and had got it all to measure over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the question about delivering the letter to Hetty soon absorbed\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. Arthur had procured some relief to himself by throwing\r\nthe decision on Adam with a warning; and Adam, who was not given to\r\nhesitation, hesitated here. He determined to feel his way\xe2\x80\x94to ascertain\r\nas well as he could what was Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind before he decided on\r\ndelivering the letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX\r\nThe Delivery of the Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church,\r\nhoping for an invitation to go home with them. He had the letter in his\r\npocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty\r\nalone. He could not see her face at church, for she had changed her\r\nseat, and when he came up to her to shake hands, her manner was\r\ndoubtful and constrained. He expected this, for it was the first time\r\nshe had met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with\r\nArthur in the Grove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, you\xe2\x80\x99ll go on with us, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poyser said when they reached\r\nthe turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to\r\noffer his arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of\r\nlingering behind a little, and then Adam said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this\r\nevening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I\xe2\x80\x99ve something partic\xe2\x80\x99lar to talk to\r\nyou about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d She was really as anxious as Adam was that she\r\nshould have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of\r\nher and Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had\r\nno conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and\r\nAdam. Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with\r\nher, and perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle, but it never entered\r\nher mind that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It\r\nwas a relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted\r\nto speak to _her_ alone; for she had trembled when she found he was\r\ngoing home with them lest he should mean \xe2\x80\x9cto tell.\xe2\x80\x9d But, now he wanted\r\nto talk to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what he\r\nmeant to do. She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him\r\nnot to do anything she did not want him to do; she could perhaps even\r\nmake him believe that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for Arthur; and as long as Adam\r\nthought there was any hope of her having him, he would do just what she\r\nliked, she knew. Besides, she _must_ go on seeming to encourage Adam,\r\nlest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some\r\nsecret lover.\r\n\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s arm and said \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to some slight observations of his\r\nabout the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds this next\r\nwinter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till\r\nmorning. And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue\r\nher thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a\r\nyoung man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he\r\nwould nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business\r\nthe while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most\r\nrecent news about the Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the walk, he\r\nclaimed Adam\xe2\x80\x99s conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots\r\nand imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked\r\nalong by the hedgerows on honest Adam\xe2\x80\x99s arm, quite as well as if she\r\nhad been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a\r\ncountry beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is\r\nastonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of a\r\nlady in society and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect to the\r\nproblem of committing indiscretions without compromising herself.\r\nPerhaps the resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very\r\nunhappy all the while. The parting with Arthur was a double pain to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94mingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim\r\nundefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite\r\nunlike her dream. She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had\r\nuttered in their last meeting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come again at Christmas, and\r\nthen we will see what can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d She clung to the belief that he was\r\nso fond of her, he would never be happy without her; and she still\r\nhugged her secret\xe2\x80\x94that a great gentleman loved her\xe2\x80\x94with gratified\r\npride, as a superiority over all the girls she knew. But the\r\nuncertainty of the future, the possibilities to which she could give no\r\nshape, began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air; she\r\nwas alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the\r\ndark unknown water where Arthur was gone. She could gather no elation\r\nof spirits now by looking forward, but only by looking backward to\r\nbuild confidence on past words and caresses. But occasionally, since\r\nThursday evening, her dim anxieties had been almost lost behind the\r\nmore definite fear that Adam might betray what he knew to her uncle and\r\naunt, and his sudden proposition to talk with her alone had set her\r\nthoughts to work in a new way. She was eager not to lose this evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopportunity; and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden\r\nand Totty begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that\r\nsurprised Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with her, Aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too, and\r\nsoon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the\r\nfilbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large\r\nunripe nuts to play at \xe2\x80\x9ccob-nut\xe2\x80\x9d with, and Totty was watching them with\r\na puppylike air of contemplation. It was but a short time\xe2\x80\x94hardly two\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x94since Adam had had his mind filled with delicious hopes as he\r\nstood by Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s side in this garden. The remembrance of that scene had\r\noften been with him since Thursday evening: the sunlight through the\r\napple-tree boughs, the red bunches, Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s sweet blush. It came\r\nimportunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds,\r\nbut he tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say\r\nmore than was needful for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nme making too free in what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say. If you was being courted\r\nby any man as \xe2\x80\x99ud make you his wife, and I\xe2\x80\x99d known you was fond of him\r\nand meant to have him, I should have no right to speak a word to you\r\nabout it; but when I see you\xe2\x80\x99re being made love to by a gentleman as\r\ncan never marry you, and doesna think o\xe2\x80\x99 marrying you, I feel bound t\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterfere for you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak about it to them as are i\xe2\x80\x99 the place\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 your parents, for that might bring worse trouble than\xe2\x80\x99s needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s words relieved one of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s fears, but they also carried a\r\nmeaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She was pale\r\nand trembling, and yet she would have angrily contradicted Adam, if she\r\nhad dared to betray her feelings. But she was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so young, you know, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, almost tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ny\xe2\x80\x99 haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen much o\xe2\x80\x99 what goes on in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s right for me to\r\ndo what I can to save you from getting into trouble for want o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nknowing where you\xe2\x80\x99re being led to. If anybody besides me knew what I\r\nknow about your meeting a gentleman and having fine presents from him,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d speak light on you, and you\xe2\x80\x99d lose your character. And besides\r\nthat, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to suffer in your feelings, wi\xe2\x80\x99 giving your love to a\r\nman as can never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from the\r\nfilbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand. Her little plans and\r\npreconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-learnt lesson,\r\nunder the terrible agitation produced by Adam\xe2\x80\x99s words. There was a\r\ncruel force in their calm certainty which threatened to grapple and\r\ncrush her flimsy hopes and fancies. She wanted to resist them\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwanted to throw them off with angry contradiction\xe2\x80\x94but the determination\r\nto conceal what she felt still governed her. It was nothing more than a\r\nblind prompting now, for she was unable to calculate the effect of her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to say as I love him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly, but\r\nimpetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She was\r\nvery beautiful in her paleness and agitation, with her dark childish\r\neyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s heart yearned\r\nover her as he looked at her. Ah, if he could but comfort her, and\r\nsoothe her, and save her from this pain; if he had but some sort of\r\nstrength that would enable him to rescue her poor troubled mind, as he\r\nwould have rescued her body in the face of all danger!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it must be so, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tenderly; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I canna believe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a gold box with\r\nhis hair, and go a-walking i\xe2\x80\x99 the Grove to meet him, if you didna love\r\nhim. I\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming you, for I know it \xe2\x80\x99ud begin by little and little,\r\ntill at last you\xe2\x80\x99d not be able to throw it off. It\xe2\x80\x99s him I blame for\r\nstealing your love i\xe2\x80\x99 that way, when he knew he could never make you\r\nthe right amends. He\xe2\x80\x99s been trifling with you, and making a plaything\r\nof you, and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty burst out.\r\nEverything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cif he\xe2\x80\x99d cared for you rightly, he\xe2\x80\x99d never ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbehaved so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and\r\npresents, and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ntoo. But I know better nor that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntrusting to his loving you well enough to marry you, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I must speak to you about it, Hetty, for fear\r\nyou should be deceiving yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s never entered his head the\r\nthought o\xe2\x80\x99 marrying you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know? How durst you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, pausing in her\r\nwalk and trembling. The terrible decision of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s tone shook her with\r\nfear. She had no presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur\r\nwould have his reasons for not telling the truth to Adam. Her words and\r\nlook were enough to determine Adam: he must give her the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94because you think he loves you better than he does. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nletter i\xe2\x80\x99 my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not\r\nread the letter, but he says he\xe2\x80\x99s told you the truth in it. But before\r\nI give you the letter, consider, Hetty, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let it take too much\r\nhold on you. It wouldna ha\xe2\x80\x99 been good for you if he\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to do such\r\na mad thing as marry you: it \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 led to no happiness i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a\r\nletter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite\r\ndifferent in it from what he thought.\r\n\r\nAdam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while he\r\nsaid, in a tone of tender entreaty, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you bear me ill will, Hetty,\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m the means o\xe2\x80\x99 bringing you this pain. God knows I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nborne a good deal worse for the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 sparing it you. And\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody but me knows about this, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you\r\nas if I was your brother. You\xe2\x80\x99re the same as ever to me, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you\xe2\x80\x99ve done any wrong knowingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it till\r\nhe had done speaking. She took no notice of what he said\xe2\x80\x94she had not\r\nlistened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it into her pocket,\r\nwithout opening it, and then began to walk more quickly, as if she\r\nwanted to go in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in the right not to read it just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cRead it when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and let us call\r\nthe children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may take notice of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty heard the warning. It recalled to her the necessity of rallying\r\nher native powers of concealment, which had half given way under the\r\nshock of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s words. And she had the letter in her pocket: she was\r\nsure there was comfort in that letter in spite of Adam. She ran to find\r\nTotty, and soon reappeared with recovered colour, leading Totty, who\r\nwas making a sour face because she had been obliged to throw away an\r\nunripe apple that she had set her small teeth in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, Totty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and ride on my shoulder\xe2\x80\x94ever so\r\nhigh\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll touch the tops o\xe2\x80\x99 the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious sense\r\nof being seized strongly and swung upward? I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Ganymede\r\ncried when the eagle carried him away, and perhaps deposited him on\r\nJove\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder at the end. Totty smiled down complacently from her\r\nsecure height, and pleasant was the sight to the mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as she\r\nstood at the house door and saw Adam coming with his small burden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your sweet face, my pet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, the mother\xe2\x80\x99s strong love\r\nfilling her keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward and put\r\nout her arms. She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment, and only said,\r\nwithout looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou go and draw some ale, Hetty; the gells are\r\nboth at the cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the ale had been drawn and her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s pipe lighted, there was\r\nTotty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-gown\r\nbecause she would cry instead of going to sleep. Then there was supper\r\nto be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in the way to give help.\r\nAdam stayed till he knew Mrs. Poyser expected him to go, engaging her\r\nand her husband in talk as constantly as he could, for the sake of\r\nleaving Hetty more at ease. He lingered, because he wanted to see her\r\nsafely through that evening, and he was delighted to find how much\r\nself-command she showed. He knew she had not had time to read the\r\nletter, but he did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the\r\nletter would contradict everything he had said. It was hard work for\r\nhim to leave her\xe2\x80\x94hard to think that he should not know for days how she\r\nwas bearing her trouble. But he must go at last, and all he could do\r\nwas to press her hand gently as he said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d and hope she would\r\ntake that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her, it\r\nwas there the same as ever. How busy his thoughts were, as he walked\r\nhome, in devising pitying excuses for her folly, in referring all her\r\nweakness to the sweet lovingness of her nature, in blaming Arthur, with\r\nless and less inclination to admit that _his_ conduct might be\r\nextenuated too! His exasperation at Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s suffering\xe2\x80\x94and also at the\r\nsense that she was possibly thrust for ever out of his own\r\nreach\xe2\x80\x94deafened him to any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought\r\nthis misery. Adam was a clear-sighted, fair-minded man\xe2\x80\x94a fine fellow,\r\nindeed, morally as well as physically. But if Aristides the Just was\r\never in love and jealous, he was at that moment not perfectly\r\nmagnanimous. And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful days,\r\nfelt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity. He was bitterly\r\njealous, and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his\r\njudgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer head was allays likely to be turned,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a\r\ngentleman, with his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white\r\nhands, and that way o\xe2\x80\x99 talking gentlefolks have, came about her, making\r\nup to her in a bold way, as a man couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that was only her equal;\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s much if she\xe2\x80\x99ll ever like a common man now.\xe2\x80\x9d He could not help\r\ndrawing his own hands out of his pocket and looking at them\xe2\x80\x94at the hard\r\npalms and the broken finger-nails. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a roughish fellow, altogether;\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, now I come to think on\xe2\x80\x99t, what there is much for a woman\r\nto like about me; and yet I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 got another wife easy enough, if\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t set my heart on her. But it\xe2\x80\x99s little matter what other women\r\nthink about me, if she can\xe2\x80\x99t love me. She might ha\xe2\x80\x99 loved me, perhaps,\r\nas likely as any other man\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody hereabouts as I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of,\r\nif _he_ hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to\r\nher because I\xe2\x80\x99m so different to him. And yet there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling\xe2\x80\x94she may\r\nturn round the other way, when she finds he\xe2\x80\x99s made light of her all the\r\nwhile. She may come to feel the vally of a man as \xe2\x80\x99ud be thankful to be\r\nbound to her all his life. But I must put up with it whichever way it\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to be thankful it\xe2\x80\x99s been no worse. I am not th\xe2\x80\x99 only man\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s got to do without much happiness i\xe2\x80\x99 this life. There\xe2\x80\x99s many a\r\ngood bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work done with a bad heart. It\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s will, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough for us: we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know better how things ought to be than He\r\ndoes, I reckon, if we was to spend our lives i\xe2\x80\x99 puzzling. But it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 gone near to spoil my work for me, if I\xe2\x80\x99d seen her brought to\r\nsorrow and shame, and through the man as I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been proud to\r\nthink on. Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spared that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to grumble. When a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s got his limbs whole, he can bear a smart cut or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections, he\r\nperceived a man walking along the field before him. He knew it was\r\nSeth, returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to overtake\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought thee\xe2\x80\x99dst be at home before me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as Seth turned\r\nround to wait for him, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99m later than usual to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John\r\nBarnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d a question to ask him about his experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nsubjects that lead you further than y\xe2\x80\x99 expect\xe2\x80\x94they don\xe2\x80\x99t lie along the\r\nstraight road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along together in silence two or three minutes. Adam was\r\nnot inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but\r\nhe was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and\r\nconfidence with Seth. That was a rare impulse in him, much as the\r\nbrothers loved each other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters,\r\nor uttered more than an allusion to their family troubles. Adam was by\r\nnature reserved in all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain\r\ntimidity towards his more practical brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeth, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, putting his arm on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me I might write her word after a while,\r\nhow we went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble. So I wrote to\r\nher a fortnight ago, and told her about thee having a new employment,\r\nand how Mother was more contented; and last Wednesday, when I called at\r\nthe post at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on, I found a letter from her. I think thee\xe2\x80\x99dst\r\nperhaps like to read it, but I didna say anything about it because\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99st seemed so full of other things. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite easy t\xe2\x80\x99 read\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwrites wonderful for a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam, who\r\nsaid, as he took it, \xe2\x80\x9cAye, lad, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a tough load to carry just\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94thee mustna take it ill if I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit silenter and crustier nor\r\nusual. Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee. I know we shall\r\nstick together to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take nought ill o\xe2\x80\x99 thee, Adam. I know well enough what it means if\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99t a bit short wi\xe2\x80\x99 me now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Mother opening the door to look out for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, as\r\nthey mounted the slope. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been sitting i\xe2\x80\x99 the dark as usual. Well,\r\nGyp, well, art glad to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she had heard\r\nthe welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s joyful\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my lads! Th\xe2\x80\x99 hours war ne\xe2\x80\x99er so long sin\xe2\x80\x99 I war born as they\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nbeen this blessed Sunday night. What can ye both ha\xe2\x80\x99 been doin\xe2\x80\x99 till\r\nthis time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee shouldstna sit i\xe2\x80\x99 the dark, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam; \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes the\r\ntime seem longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, what am I to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 burnin\xe2\x80\x99 candle of a Sunday, when there\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y\r\nme an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s sin to do a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 knittin\xe2\x80\x99? The daylight\xe2\x80\x99s long enough for\r\nme to stare i\xe2\x80\x99 the booke as I canna read. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a fine way o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshortenin\xe2\x80\x99 the time, to make it waste the good candle. But which on\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99s for ha\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 supper? Ye mun ayther be clemmed or full, I should\r\nthink, seein\xe2\x80\x99 what time o\xe2\x80\x99 night it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hungry, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, seating himself at the little table,\r\nwhich had been spread ever since it was light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had my supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Gyp,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking some\r\ncold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey head that looked\r\nup towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee needstna be gi\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99n fed him well\r\na\xe2\x80\x99ready. I\xe2\x80\x99m not like to forget him, I reckon, when he\xe2\x80\x99s all o\xe2\x80\x99 thee I\r\ncan get sight on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, Gyp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed. Good-night, Mother; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nvery tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ails him, dost know?\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth said to Seth, when Adam was gone\r\nupstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s like as if he was struck for death this day or two\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso cast down. I found him i\xe2\x80\x99 the shop this forenoon, arter thee wast\r\ngone, a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 doin\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94not so much as a booke afore him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 work upon him just now, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit troubled in his mind. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you take notice of it,\r\nbecause it hurts him when you do. Be as kind to him as you can, Mother,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to vex him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, what dost talk o\xe2\x80\x99 my vexin\xe2\x80\x99 him? An\xe2\x80\x99 what am I like to be but\r\nkind? I\xe2\x80\x99ll ma\xe2\x80\x99 him a kettle-cake for breakfast i\xe2\x80\x99 the mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, meanwhile, was reading Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s letter by the light of his dip\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER SETH\xe2\x80\x94Your letter lay three days beyond my knowing of it at\r\nthe post, for I had not money enough by me to pay the carriage, this\r\nbeing a time of great need and sickness here, with the rains that have\r\nfallen, as if the windows of heaven were opened again; and to lay by\r\nmoney, from day to day, in such a time, when there are so many in\r\npresent need of all things, would be a want of trust like the laying up\r\nof the manna. I speak of this, because I would not have you think me\r\nslow to answer, or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the\r\nworldly good that has befallen your brother Adam. The honour and love\r\nyou bear him is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts,\r\nand he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted\r\nto a place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his\r\nparent and his younger brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be\r\nnear her in the day of trouble. Speak to her of me, and tell her I\r\noften bear her in my thoughts at evening time, when I am sitting in the\r\ndim light as I did with her, and we held one another\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and I\r\nspoke the words of comfort that were given to me. Ah, that is a blessed\r\ntime, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Seth, when the outward light is fading, and the body is\r\na little wearied with its work and its labour. Then the inward light\r\nshines the brighter, and we have a deeper sense of resting on the\r\nDivine strength. I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes,\r\nand it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for\r\nevermore. For then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the\r\nblindness, and the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep over\xe2\x80\x94yea,\r\nall the anguish of the children of men, which sometimes wraps me round\r\nlike sudden darkness\xe2\x80\x94I can bear with a willing pain, as if I was\r\nsharing the Redeemer\xe2\x80\x99s cross. For I feel it, I feel it\xe2\x80\x94infinite love is\r\nsuffering too\xe2\x80\x94yea, in the fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns,\r\nit mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed\r\nfrom the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth.\r\nSurely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there\r\nis sorrow and sin in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love\r\ndoes not seek to throw it off. It is not the spirit only that tells me\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94I see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel. Is there not\r\npleading in heaven? Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that crucified\r\nbody wherewith he ascended? And is He not one with the Infinite Love\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94as our love is one with our sorrow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen\r\nwith new clearness the meaning of those words, \xe2\x80\x98If any man love me, let\r\nhim take up my cross.\xe2\x80\x99 I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the\r\ntroubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus.\r\nBut surely that is a narrow thought. The true cross of the Redeemer was\r\nthe sin and sorrow of this world\xe2\x80\x94_that_ was what lay heavy on his\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94and that is the cross we shall share with him, that is the cup we\r\nmust drink of with him, if we would have any part in that Divine Love\r\nwhich is one with his sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and abound.\r\nI have had constant work in the mill, though some of the other hands\r\nhave been turned off for a time, and my body is greatly strengthened,\r\nso that I feel little weariness after long walking and speaking. What\r\nyou say about staying in your own country with your mother and brother\r\nshows me that you have a true guidance; your lot is appointed there by\r\na clear showing, and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like\r\nlaying a false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven\r\nto kindle it. My work and my joy are here among the hills, and I\r\nsometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people here, and\r\nshould be rebellious if I was called away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the Hall\r\nFarm, for though I sent them a letter, by my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s desire, after I\r\ncame back from my sojourn among them, I have had no word from them. My\r\naunt has not the pen of a ready writer, and the work of the house is\r\nsufficient for the day, for she is weak in body. My heart cleaves to\r\nher and her children as the nearest of all to me in the flesh\xe2\x80\x94yea, and\r\nto all in that house. I am carried away to them continually in my\r\nsleep, and often in the midst of work, and even of speech, the thought\r\nof them is borne in on me as if they were in need and trouble, which\r\nyet is dark to me. There may be some leading here; but I wait to be\r\ntaught. You say they are all well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it may be,\r\nnot for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are\r\ndesirous to have me for a short space among them, when I have a door\r\nopened me again to leave Snowfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, dear brother\xe2\x80\x94and yet not farewell. For those children of God\r\nwhom it has been granted to see each other face to face, and to hold\r\ncommunion together, and to feel the same spirit working in both can\r\nnever more be sundered though the hills may lie between. For their\r\nsouls are enlarged for evermore by that union, and they bear one\r\nanother about in their thoughts continually as it were a new\r\nstrength.\xe2\x80\x94Your faithful Sister and fellow-worker in Christ,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDINAH MORRIS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen\r\nmoves slow. And so I am straitened, and say but little of what is in my\r\nmind. Greet your mother for me with a kiss. She asked me to kiss her\r\ntwice when we parted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with his\r\nhead resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast read the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought of her and\r\nher letter if I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen her: I daresay I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought a\r\npreaching woman hateful. But she\xe2\x80\x99s one as makes everything seem right\r\nshe says and does, and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I\r\nread the letter. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d make thee rare and happy, Seth; she\xe2\x80\x99s just the woman for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, despondingly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe spoke so\r\nfirm, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not the woman to say one thing and mean another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but her feelings may grow different. A woman may get to love by\r\ndegrees\xe2\x80\x94the best fire dosna flare up the soonest. I\xe2\x80\x99d have thee go and\r\nsee her by and by: I\xe2\x80\x99d make it convenient for thee to be away three or\r\nfour days, and it \xe2\x80\x99ud be no walk for thee\xe2\x80\x94only between twenty and\r\nthirty mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see her again, whether or no, if she wouldna be\r\ndispleased with me for going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be none displeased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam emphatically, getting up and\r\nthrowing off his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be a great happiness to us all if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d have thee, for mother took to her so wonderful and seemed so\r\ncontented to be with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, rather timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cand Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s fond o\xe2\x80\x99 Hetty too; she\r\nthinks a deal about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam made no reply to that, and no other word but \xe2\x80\x9cgood-night\xe2\x80\x9d passed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI\r\nIn Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s Bed-Chamber\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was no longer light enough to go to bed without a candle, even in\r\nMrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s early household, and Hetty carried one with her as she\r\nwent up at last to her bedroom soon after Adam was gone, and bolted the\r\ndoor behind her.\r\n\r\n_Now_ she would read her letter. It must\xe2\x80\x94it must have comfort in it.\r\nHow was Adam to know the truth? It was always likely he should say what\r\nhe did say.\r\n\r\nShe set down the candle and took out the letter. It had a faint scent\r\nof roses, which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her. She put\r\nit to her lips, and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two\r\nswept away all fear. But her heart began to flutter strangely, and her\r\nhands to tremble as she broke the seal. She read slowly; it was not\r\neasy for her to read a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, though Arthur had taken\r\npains to write plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAREST HETTY\xe2\x80\x94I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you,\r\nand I shall never forget our love. I shall be your true friend as long\r\nas life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many ways. If I say\r\nanything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of\r\nlove and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do\r\nfor you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to\r\nthink of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss\r\nthem away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with\r\nher at this moment instead of writing. It is very hard for me to part\r\nfrom her\xe2\x80\x94harder still for me to write words which may seem unkind,\r\nthough they spring from the truest kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would\r\nbe to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been\r\nbetter for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is\r\nmy duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as you can. The\r\nfault has all been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the\r\nlonging to be near you, I have felt all the while that your affection\r\nfor me might cause you grief. I ought to have resisted my feelings. I\r\nshould have done so, if I had been a better fellow than I am; but now,\r\nsince the past cannot be altered, I am bound to save you from any evil\r\nthat I have power to prevent. And I feel it would be a great evil for\r\nyou if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of\r\nno other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I\r\never can, and if you continued to look towards something in the future\r\nwhich cannot possibly happen. For, dear Hetty, if I were to do what you\r\none day spoke of, and make you my wife, I should do what you yourself\r\nwould come to feel was for your misery instead of your welfare. I know\r\nyou can never be happy except by marrying a man in your own station;\r\nand if I were to marry you now, I should only be adding to any wrong I\r\nhave done, besides offending against my duty in the other relations of\r\nlife. You know nothing, dear Hetty, of the world in which I must always\r\nlive, and you would soon begin to dislike me, because there would be so\r\nlittle in which we should be alike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd since I cannot marry you, we must part\xe2\x80\x94we must try not to feel\r\nlike lovers any more. I am miserable while I say this, but nothing else\r\ncan be. Be angry with me, my sweet one, I deserve it; but do not\r\nbelieve that I shall not always care for you\xe2\x80\x94always be grateful to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94always remember my Hetty; and if any trouble should come that we do\r\nnot now foresee, trust in me to do everything that lies in my power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you where you are to direct a letter to, if you want to\r\nwrite, but I put it down below lest you should have forgotten. Do not\r\nwrite unless there is something I can really do for you; for, dear\r\nHetty, we must try to think of each other as little as we can. Forgive\r\nme, and try to forget everything about me, except that I shall be, as\r\nlong as I live, your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARTHUR DONNITHORNE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly Hetty had read this letter; and when she looked up from it there\r\nwas the reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glass\xe2\x80\x94a white\r\nmarble face with rounded childish forms, but with something sadder than\r\na child\xe2\x80\x99s pain in it. Hetty did not see the face\xe2\x80\x94she saw nothing\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nonly felt that she was cold and sick and trembling. The letter shook\r\nand rustled in her hand. She laid it down. It was a horrible\r\nsensation\xe2\x80\x94this cold and trembling. It swept away the very ideas that\r\nproduced it, and Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her\r\nclothes-press, wrapped it round her, and sat as if she were thinking of\r\nnothing but getting warm. Presently she took up the letter with a\r\nfirmer hand, and began to read it through again. The tears came this\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94great rushing tears that blinded her and blotched the paper. She\r\nfelt nothing but that Arthur was cruel\xe2\x80\x94cruel to write so, cruel not to\r\nmarry her. Reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her\r\nmind; how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from\r\nthe fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of? She had\r\nnot the ideas that could make up the notion of that misery.\r\n\r\nAs she threw down the letter again, she caught sight of her face in the\r\nglass; it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was almost like a\r\ncompanion that she might complain to\xe2\x80\x94that would pity her. She leaned\r\nforward on her elbows, and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and\r\nat the quivering mouth, and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker,\r\nand how the mouth became convulsed with sobs.\r\n\r\nThe shattering of all her little dream-world, the crushing blow on her\r\nnew-born passion, afflicted her pleasure-craving nature with an\r\noverpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to resistance, and\r\nsuspended her anger. She sat sobbing till the candle went out, and\r\nthen, wearied, aching, stupefied with crying, threw herself on the bed\r\nwithout undressing and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nThere was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little after\r\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which broke\r\nupon her gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the\r\ndim light. And then came the frightening thought that she had to\r\nconceal her misery as well as to bear it, in this dreary daylight that\r\nwas coming. She could lie no longer. She got up and went towards the\r\ntable: there lay the letter. She opened her treasure-drawer: there lay\r\nthe ear-rings and the locket\xe2\x80\x94the signs of all her short happiness\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsigns of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it. Looking at the\r\nlittle trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the\r\nearnest of her future paradise of finery, she lived back in the moments\r\nwhen they had been given to her with such tender caresses, such\r\nstrangely pretty words, such glowing looks, which filled her with a\r\nbewildering delicious surprise\xe2\x80\x94they were so much sweeter than she had\r\nthought anything could be. And the Arthur who had spoken to her and\r\nlooked at her in this way, who was present with her now\xe2\x80\x94whose arm she\r\nfelt round her, his cheek against hers, his very breath upon her\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nthe cruel, cruel Arthur who had written that letter, that letter which\r\nshe snatched and crushed and then opened again, that she might read it\r\nonce more. The half-benumbed mental condition which was the effect of\r\nthe last night\xe2\x80\x99s violent crying made it necessary to her to look again\r\nand see if her wretched thoughts were actually true\xe2\x80\x94if the letter was\r\nreally so cruel. She had to hold it close to the window, else she could\r\nnot have read it by the faint light. Yes! It was worse\xe2\x80\x94it was more\r\ncruel. She crushed it up again in anger. She hated the writer of that\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94hated him for the very reason that she hung upon him with all\r\nher love\xe2\x80\x94all the girlish passion and vanity that made up her love.\r\n\r\nShe had no tears this morning. She had wept them all away last night,\r\nand now she felt that dry-eyed morning misery, which is worse than the\r\nfirst shock because it has the future in it as well as the present.\r\nEvery morning to come, as far as her imagination could stretch, she\r\nwould have to get up and feel that the day would have no joy for her.\r\nFor there is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first\r\nmoments of our first great sorrow, when we have not yet known what it\r\nis to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and to have\r\nrecovered hope. As Hetty began languidly to take off the clothes she\r\nhad worn all the night, that she might wash herself and brush her hair,\r\nshe had a sickening sense that her life would go on in this way. She\r\nshould always be doing things she had no pleasure in, getting up to the\r\nold tasks of work, seeing people she cared nothing about, going to\r\nchurch, and to Treddleston, and to tea with Mrs. Best, and carrying no\r\nhappy thought with her. For her short poisonous delights had spoiled\r\nfor ever all the little joys that had once made the sweetness of her\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94the new frock ready for Treddleston Fair, the party at Mr.\r\nBritton\xe2\x80\x99s at Broxton wake, the beaux that she would say \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d to for a\r\nlong while, and the prospect of the wedding that was to come at last\r\nwhen she would have a silk gown and a great many clothes all at once.\r\nThese things were all flat and dreary to her now; everything would be a\r\nweariness, and she would carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and\r\nlonging.\r\n\r\nShe paused in the midst of her languid undressing and leaned against\r\nthe dark old clothes-press. Her neck and arms were bare, her hair hung\r\ndown in delicate rings\xe2\x80\x94and they were just as beautiful as they were\r\nthat night two months ago, when she walked up and down this bed-chamber\r\nglowing with vanity and hope. She was not thinking of her neck and arms\r\nnow; even her own beauty was indifferent to her. Her eyes wandered\r\nsadly over the dull old chamber, and then looked out vacantly towards\r\nthe growing dawn. Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her mind? Of\r\nher foreboding words, which had made her angry? Of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate\r\nentreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble? No, the impression had\r\nbeen too slight to recur. Any affection or comfort Dinah could have\r\ngiven her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as\r\neverything else was except her bruised passion. She was only thinking\r\nshe could never stay here and go on with the old life\xe2\x80\x94she could better\r\nbear something quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round.\r\nShe would like to run away that very morning, and never see any of the\r\nold faces again. But Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s was not a nature to face difficulties\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ndare to loose her hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown\r\ncondition. Hers was a luxurious and vain nature\xe2\x80\x94not a passionate\r\none\xe2\x80\x94and if she were ever to take any violent measure, she must be urged\r\nto it by the desperation of terror. There was not much room for her\r\nthoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination, and she\r\nsoon fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life:\r\nshe would ask her uncle to let her go to be a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid. Miss Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid would help her to get a situation, if she knew Hetty had her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\r\n\r\nWhen she had thought of this, she fastened up her hair and began to\r\nwash: it seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave\r\nas usual. She would ask her uncle this very day. On Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s blooming\r\nhealth it would take a great deal of such mental suffering as hers to\r\nleave any deep impress; and when she was dressed as neatly as usual in\r\nher working-dress, with her hair tucked up under her little cap, an\r\nindifferent observer would have been more struck with the young\r\nroundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and\r\neyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her. But when she took\r\nup the crushed letter and put it in her drawer, that she might lock it\r\nout of sight, hard smarting tears, having no relief in them as the\r\ngreat drops had that fell last night, forced their way into her eyes.\r\nShe wiped them away quickly: she must not cry in the day-time. Nobody\r\nshould find out how miserable she was, nobody should know she was\r\ndisappointed about anything; and the thought that the eyes of her aunt\r\nand uncle would be upon her gave her the self-command which often\r\naccompanies a great dread. For Hetty looked out from her secret misery\r\ntowards the possibility of their ever knowing what had happened, as the\r\nsick and weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory. They would\r\nthink her conduct shameful, and shame was torture. That was poor little\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s conscience.\r\n\r\nSo she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his pipe, and his\r\ngood-nature was therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized the\r\nopportunity of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s absence to say, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d let me\r\ngo for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser took the pipe from his mouth and looked at Hetty in mild\r\nsurprise for some moments. She was sewing, and went on with her work\r\nindustriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s put that into your head, my wench?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, after\r\nhe had given one conservative puff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it\xe2\x80\x94I should like it better than farm-work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay; you fancy so because you donna know it, my wench. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be half so good for your health, nor for your luck i\xe2\x80\x99 life.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like you to stay wi\xe2\x80\x99 us till you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good husband: you\xe2\x80\x99re my\r\nown niece, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you go to service, though it was a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house, as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a home for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser paused, and puffed away at his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the needlework,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should get good wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your aunt been a bit sharp wi\xe2\x80\x99 you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, not noticing\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s further argument. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustna mind that, my wench\xe2\x80\x94she does it\r\nfor your good. She wishes you well; an\xe2\x80\x99 there isn\xe2\x80\x99t many aunts as are\r\nno kin to you \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 done by you as she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should like the work\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all very well for you to learn the work a bit\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I gev my\r\nconsent to that fast enough, sin\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Pomfret was willing to teach\r\nyou. For if anything was t\xe2\x80\x99 happen, it\xe2\x80\x99s well to know how to turn your\r\nhand to different sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 things. But I niver meant you to go to\r\nservice, my wench; my family\xe2\x80\x99s ate their own bread and cheese as fur\r\nback as anybody knows, hanna they, Father? You wouldna like your\r\ngrand-child to take wage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa-a-y,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Martin, with an elongation of the word, meant to\r\nmake it bitter as well as negative, while he leaned forward and looked\r\ndown on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the wench takes arter her mother. I\xe2\x80\x99d hard work\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 hould _her_ in, an\xe2\x80\x99 she married i\xe2\x80\x99 spite o\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x94a feller wi\xe2\x80\x99 on\xe2\x80\x99y two\r\nhead o\xe2\x80\x99 stock when there should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been ten on\xe2\x80\x99s farm\xe2\x80\x94she might well\r\ndie o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 inflammation afore she war thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was seldom the old man made so long a speech, but his son\xe2\x80\x99s question\r\nhad fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long\r\nunextinguished resentment, which had always made the grandfather more\r\nindifferent to Hetty than to his son\xe2\x80\x99s children. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune\r\nhad been spent by that good-for-nought Sorrel, and Hetty had Sorrel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood in her veins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin the younger, who was sorry to\r\nhave provoked this retrospective harshness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d but bad luck. But\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s got as good a chance o\xe2\x80\x99 getting a solid, sober husband as any\r\ngell i\xe2\x80\x99 this country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter throwing out this pregnant hint, Mr. Poyser recurred to his pipe\r\nand his silence, looking at Hetty to see if she did not give some sign\r\nof having renounced her ill-advised wish. But instead of that, Hetty,\r\nin spite of herself, began to cry, half out of ill temper at the\r\ndenial, half out of the day\xe2\x80\x99s repressed sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, hegh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, meaning to check her playfully, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s have any crying. Crying\xe2\x80\x99s for them as ha\xe2\x80\x99 got no home, not for\r\nthem as want to get rid o\xe2\x80\x99 one. What dost think?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to his\r\nwife, who now came back into the house-place, knitting with fierce\r\nrapidity, as if that movement were a necessary function, like the\r\ntwittering of a crab\xe2\x80\x99s antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink? Why, I think we shall have the fowl stole before we are much\r\nolder, wi\xe2\x80\x99 that gell forgetting to lock the pens up o\xe2\x80\x99 nights. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe matter now, Hetty? What are you crying at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s been wanting to go for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntell her we can do better for her nor that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought she\xe2\x80\x99d got some maggot in her head, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone about wi\xe2\x80\x99 her\r\nmouth buttoned up so all day. It\xe2\x80\x99s all wi\xe2\x80\x99 going so among them servants\r\nat the Chase, as we war fools for letting her. She thinks it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a\r\nfiner life than being wi\xe2\x80\x99 them as are akin to her and ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought her\r\nup sin\xe2\x80\x99 she war no bigger nor Marty. She thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing belongs\r\nto being a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid but wearing finer clothes nor she was born to,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. It\xe2\x80\x99s what rag she can get to stick on her as she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthinking on from morning till night, as I often ask her if she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to be the mawkin i\xe2\x80\x99 the field, for then she\xe2\x80\x99d be made o\xe2\x80\x99 rags\r\ninside and out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never gi\xe2\x80\x99 my consent to her going for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid, while she\xe2\x80\x99s got good friends to take care on her till she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarried to somebody better nor one o\xe2\x80\x99 them valets, as is neither a\r\ncommon man nor a gentleman, an\xe2\x80\x99 must live on the fat o\xe2\x80\x99 the land, an\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike enough to stick his hands under his coat-tails and expect his wife\r\nto work for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have a better husband for her nor\r\nthat, and there\xe2\x80\x99s better at hand. Come, my wench, give over crying and\r\nget to bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do better for you nor letting you go for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear no more on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Hetty was gone upstairs he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI canna make it out as she\r\nshould want to go away, for I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d got a mind t\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Bede.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s looked like it o\xe2\x80\x99 late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what she\xe2\x80\x99s got a liking to, for things take no\r\nmore hold on her than if she was a dried pea. I believe that gell,\r\nMolly\xe2\x80\x94as is aggravatin\xe2\x80\x99 enough, for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x94but I believe\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d care more about leaving us and the children, for all she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nhere but a year come Michaelmas, nor Hetty would. But she\xe2\x80\x99s got this\r\nnotion o\xe2\x80\x99 being a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid wi\xe2\x80\x99 going among them servants\xe2\x80\x94we might\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 known what it \xe2\x80\x99ud lead to when we let her go to learn the fine\r\nwork. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a stop to it pretty quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99dst be sorry to part wi\xe2\x80\x99 her, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for her good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s useful to thee i\xe2\x80\x99 the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry? Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m fonder on her nor she deserves\xe2\x80\x94a little hard-hearted\r\nhussy, wanting to leave us i\xe2\x80\x99 that way. I can\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 had her about me\r\nthese seven year, I reckon, and done for her, and taught her everything\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99out caring about her. An\xe2\x80\x99 here I\xe2\x80\x99m having linen spun, an\xe2\x80\x99 thinking\r\nall the while it\xe2\x80\x99ll make sheeting and table-clothing for her when she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarried, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99ll live i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish wi\xe2\x80\x99 us, and never go out of our\r\nsights\xe2\x80\x94like a fool as I am for thinking aught about her, as is no\r\nbetter nor a cherry wi\xe2\x80\x99 a hard stone inside it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser,\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s fond on us, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound; but she\xe2\x80\x99s young, an\xe2\x80\x99 gets\r\nthings in her head as she can\xe2\x80\x99t rightly give account on. Them young\r\nfillies \xe2\x80\x99ull run away often wi\xe2\x80\x99out knowing why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer uncle\xe2\x80\x99s answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty besides\r\nthat of disappointing her and making her cry. She knew quite well whom\r\nhe had in his mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid\r\nhusband; and when she was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her\r\nmarrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light. In a mind where\r\nno strong sympathies are at work, where there is no supreme sense of\r\nright to which the agitated nature can cling and steady itself to quiet\r\nendurance, one of the first results of sorrow is a desperate vague\r\nclutching after any deed that will change the actual condition. Poor\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s vision of consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic\r\ncalculation of her own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut\r\nout by reckless irritation under present suffering, and she was ready\r\nfor one of those convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched men\r\nand women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery.\r\n\r\nWhy should she not marry Adam? She did not care what she did, so that\r\nit made some change in her life. She felt confident that he would still\r\nwant to marry her, and any further thought about Adam\xe2\x80\x99s happiness in\r\nthe matter had never yet visited her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange!\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps you will say, \xe2\x80\x9cthis rush of impulse towards a course\r\nthat might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind,\r\nand in only the second night of her sadness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, the actions of a little trivial soul like Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s, struggling\r\namidst the serious sad destinies of a human being, _are_ strange. So\r\nare the motions of a little vessel without ballast tossed about on a\r\nstormy sea. How pretty it looked with its parti-coloured sail in the\r\nsunlight, moored in the quiet bay!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that will not save the vessel\xe2\x80\x94the pretty thing that might have been\r\na lasting joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\nMrs. Poyser \xe2\x80\x9cHas Her Say Out\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the\r\nDonnithorne Arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94no less than a second appearance of the smart man in top-boots said\r\nby some to be a mere farmer in treaty for the Chase Farm, by others to\r\nbe the future steward, but by Mr. Casson himself, the personal witness\r\nto the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s visit, pronounced contemptuously to be nothing better\r\nthan a bailiff, such as Satchell had been before him. No one had\r\nthought of denying Mr. Casson\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to the fact that he had seen\r\nthe stranger; nevertheless, he proffered various corroborating\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI see him coming along by the Crab-tree\r\nMeadow on a bald-faced hoss. I\xe2\x80\x99d just been t\xe2\x80\x99 hev a pint\xe2\x80\x94it was half\r\nafter ten i\xe2\x80\x99 the fore-noon, when I hev my pint as reg\xe2\x80\x99lar as the\r\nclock\xe2\x80\x94and I says to Knowles, as druv up with his waggon, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll get a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 barley to-day, Knowles,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98if you look about you\xe2\x80\x99; and\r\nthen I went round by the rick-yard, and towart the Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on road,\r\nand just as I come up by the big ash-tree, I see the man i\xe2\x80\x99 top-boots\r\ncoming along on a bald-faced hoss\xe2\x80\x94I wish I may never stir if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nAnd I stood still till he come up, and I says, \xe2\x80\x98Good morning, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsays, for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue, as I might know\r\nwhether he was a this-country man; so I says, \xe2\x80\x98Good morning, sir: it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99old hup for the barley this morning, I think. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a bit\r\ngot hin, if we\xe2\x80\x99ve good luck.\xe2\x80\x99 And he says, \xe2\x80\x98Eh, ye may be raight,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s noo tallin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, and I knowed by that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Mr. Casson\r\ngave a wink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come from a hundred mile off. I daresay he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink me a hodd talker, as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as\r\ntalks the right language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right language!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle Massey, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re about\r\nas near the right language as a pig\xe2\x80\x99s squeaking is like a tune played\r\non a key-bugle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Casson, with an angry smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by, is likely\r\nto know what\xe2\x80\x99s the right language pretty nigh as well as a\r\nschoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, with a tone of sarcastic consolation, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ntalk the right language for _you_. When Mike Holdsworth\xe2\x80\x99s goat says\r\nba-a-a, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x99ud be unnatural for it to make any other\r\nnoise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party being Loamshire men, Mr. Casson had the laugh\r\nstrongly against him, and wisely fell back on the previous question,\r\nwhich, far from being exhausted in a single evening, was renewed in the\r\nchurchyard, before service, the next day, with the fresh interest\r\nconferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it; and that\r\nfresh hearer was Martin Poyser, who, as his wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cnever went\r\nboozin\xe2\x80\x99 with that set at Casson\xe2\x80\x99s, a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 soakin\xe2\x80\x99 in drink, and\r\nlooking as wise as a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 cod-fish wi\xe2\x80\x99 red faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was probably owing to the conversation she had had with her husband\r\non their way from church concerning this problematic stranger that Mrs.\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts immediately reverted to him when, a day or two\r\nafterwards, as she was standing at the house-door with her knitting, in\r\nthat eager leisure which came to her when the afternoon cleaning was\r\ndone, she saw the old squire enter the yard on his black pony, followed\r\nby John the groom. She always cited it afterwards as a case of\r\nprevision, which really had something more in it than her own\r\nremarkable penetration, that the moment she set eyes on the squire she\r\nsaid to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldna wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s come about that man as is\r\na-going to take the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him\r\nwithout pay. But Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s a fool if he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisits to his tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser had during the\r\nlast twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches, meaning even more\r\nthan met the ear, which she was quite determined to make to him the\r\nnext time he appeared within the gates of the Hall Farm, the speeches\r\nhad always remained imaginary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Mrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old squire, peering at her with his\r\nshort-sighted eyes\xe2\x80\x94a mode of looking at her which, as Mrs. Poyser\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9callays aggravated me: it was as if you was a insect, and he\r\nwas going to dab his finger-nail on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and curtsied with an air of\r\nperfect deference as she advanced towards him: she was not the woman to\r\nmisbehave towards her betters, and fly in the face of the catechism,\r\nwithout severe provocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; he\xe2\x80\x99s only i\xe2\x80\x99 the rick-yard. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for him in a minute,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll please to get down and step in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; I will do so. I want to consult him about a little matter;\r\nbut you are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I must have\r\nyour opinion too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty, run and tell your uncle to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, as they\r\nentered the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncurtsy; while Totty, conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry\r\njam, stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round\r\nfurtively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine old kitchen this is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round\r\nadmiringly. He always spoke in the same deliberate, well-chiselled,\r\npolite way, whether his words were sugary or venomous. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you keep it\r\nso exquisitely clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these premises, do you know,\r\nbeyond any on the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, since you\xe2\x80\x99re fond of \xe2\x80\x99em, I should be glad if you\xe2\x80\x99d let a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 repairs be done to \xe2\x80\x99em, for the boarding\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 that state as\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re like to be eaten up wi\xe2\x80\x99 rats and mice; and the cellar, you may\r\nstan\xe2\x80\x99 up to your knees i\xe2\x80\x99 water in\xe2\x80\x99t, if you like to go down; but\r\nperhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d rather believe my words. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you please to sit down,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and I\r\nhear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire,\r\nlooking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which\r\nhe and Mrs. Poyser might happen to disagree. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I see the door\r\nopen, there. You must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your\r\ncream and butter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that Mrs. Satchell\xe2\x80\x99s cream and butter\r\nwill bear comparison with yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s seldom I see other folks\xe2\x80\x99s butter,\r\nthough there\xe2\x80\x99s some on it as one\xe2\x80\x99s no need to see\xe2\x80\x94the smell\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now this I like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at the damp\r\ntemple of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I should\r\nlike my breakfast better if I knew the butter and cream came from this\r\ndairy. Thank you, that really is a pleasant sight. Unfortunately, my\r\nslight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp: I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down in\r\nyour comfortable kitchen. Ah, Poyser, how do you do? In the midst of\r\nbusiness, I see, as usual. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at your wife\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful\r\ndairy\xe2\x80\x94the best manager in the parish, is she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat, with a\r\nface a shade redder than usual, from the exertion of \xe2\x80\x9cpitching.\xe2\x80\x9d As he\r\nstood, red, rotund, and radiant, before the small, wiry, cool old\r\ngentleman, he looked like a prize apple by the side of a withered crab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to take this chair, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lifting his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair forward a little: \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman,\r\nseating himself on a small chair near the door. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Mrs.\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x94sit down, pray, both of you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been far from contented, for\r\nsome time, with Mrs. Satchell\xe2\x80\x99s dairy management. I think she has not a\r\ngood method, as you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser in a hard voice,\r\nrolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window,\r\nas she continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser might sit down if\r\nhe liked, she thought; _she_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to sit down, as if she\xe2\x80\x99d give\r\nin to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr. Poyser, who looked and felt\r\nthe reverse of icy, did sit down in his three-cornered chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let the\r\nChase Farm to a respectable tenant. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of having a farm on my\r\nown hands\xe2\x80\x94nothing is made the best of in such cases, as you know. A\r\nsatisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and I think you and I, Poyser,\r\nand your excellent wife here, can enter into a little arrangement in\r\nconsequence, which will be to our mutual advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of imagination as\r\nto the nature of the arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m called upon to speak, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, after glancing at\r\nher husband with pity at his softness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know better than me; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see what the Chase Farm is t\xe2\x80\x99 us\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve cumber enough wi\xe2\x80\x99 our own\r\nfarm. Not but what I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear o\xe2\x80\x99 anybody respectable coming into\r\nthe parish; there\xe2\x80\x99s some as ha\xe2\x80\x99 been brought in as hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been looked\r\non i\xe2\x80\x99 that character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour, I assure\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little\r\nplan I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mention, especially as I hope you will find it as\r\nmuch to your own advantage as his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything t\xe2\x80\x99 our advantage, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first\r\noffer o\xe2\x80\x99 the sort I\xe2\x80\x99ve heared on. It\xe2\x80\x99s them as take advantage that get\r\nadvantage i\xe2\x80\x99 this world, _I_ think: folks have to wait long enough\r\nafore it\xe2\x80\x99s brought to \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s theory\r\nof worldly prosperity, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is too much dairy land, and too little\r\nplough land, on the Chase Farm to suit Thurle\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94indeed, he will\r\nonly take the farm on condition of some change in it: his wife, it\r\nappears, is not a clever dairy-woman, like yours. Now, the plan I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthinking of is to effect a little exchange. If you were to have the\r\nHollow Pastures, you might increase your dairy, which must be so\r\nprofitable under your wife\xe2\x80\x99s management; and I should request you, Mrs.\r\nPoyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter at the market\r\nprices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have the Lower\r\nand Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good\r\nriddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn\r\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head\r\non one side, and his mouth screwed up\xe2\x80\x94apparently absorbed in making the\r\ntips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the\r\nribs of a ship. He was much too acute a man not to see through the\r\nwhole business, and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife\xe2\x80\x99s view\r\nof the subject; but he disliked giving unpleasant answers. Unless it\r\nwas on a point of farming practice, he would rather give up than have a\r\nquarrel, any day; and, after all, it mattered more to his wife than to\r\nhim. So, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 silence, he looked up at her and said\r\nmildly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity\r\nduring his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss,\r\nlooked icily at the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her\r\nknitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her\r\nclasped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\ncorn-land afore your lease is up, which it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a year come\r\nnext Michaelmas, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll not consent to take more dairy work into my\r\nhands, either for love or money; and there\xe2\x80\x99s nayther love nor money\r\nhere, as I can see, on\xe2\x80\x99y other folks\xe2\x80\x99s love o\xe2\x80\x99 theirselves, and the\r\nmoney as is to go into other folks\xe2\x80\x99s pockets. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s them as is\r\nborn t\xe2\x80\x99 own the land, and them as is born to sweat on\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Mrs.\r\nPoyser paused to gasp a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I know it\xe2\x80\x99s christened folks\xe2\x80\x99s duty\r\nto submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood \xe2\x80\x99ull bear it; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not make a martyr o\xe2\x80\x99 myself, and wear myself to skin and bone, and\r\nworret myself as if I was a churn wi\xe2\x80\x99 butter a-coming in\xe2\x80\x99t, for no\r\nlandlord in England, not if he was King George himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire, still\r\nconfident in his own powers of persuasion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not overwork\r\nyourself; but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think your work will rather be lessened than\r\nincreased in this way? There is so much milk required at the Abbey that\r\nyou will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the\r\naddition to your dairy; and I believe selling the milk is the most\r\nprofitable way of disposing of dairy produce, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion on a\r\nquestion of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in this\r\ncase a purely abstract question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her head half-way\r\ntowards her husband and looking at the vacant arm-chair\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue for men as sit i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 chimney-corner and make believe as\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s cut wi\xe2\x80\x99 ins an\xe2\x80\x99 outs to fit int\xe2\x80\x99 everything else. If you\r\ncould make a pudding wi\xe2\x80\x99 thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 the batter, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be easy getting\r\ndinner. How do I know whether the milk \xe2\x80\x99ull be wanted constant? What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto make me sure as the house won\xe2\x80\x99t be put o\xe2\x80\x99 board wage afore we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmany months older, and then I may have to lie awake o\xe2\x80\x99 nights wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntwenty gallons o\xe2\x80\x99 milk on my mind\xe2\x80\x94and Dingall \xe2\x80\x99ull take no more butter,\r\nlet alone paying for it; and we must fat pigs till we\xe2\x80\x99re obliged to beg\r\nthe butcher on our knees to buy \xe2\x80\x99em, and lose half of \xe2\x80\x99em wi\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nmeasles. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the fetching and carrying, as \xe2\x80\x99ud be welly half a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work for a man an\xe2\x80\x99 hoss\xe2\x80\x94_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ to be took out o\xe2\x80\x99 the profits, I\r\nreckon? But there\xe2\x80\x99s folks \xe2\x80\x99ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to\r\ncarry away the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat difficulty\xe2\x80\x94about the fetching and carrying\xe2\x80\x94you will not have,\r\nMrs. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire, who thought that this entrance into\r\nparticulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs.\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x99s part. \xe2\x80\x9cBethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, begging your pardon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been used t\xe2\x80\x99 having\r\ngentlefolks\xe2\x80\x99s servants coming about my back places, a-making love to\r\nboth the gells at once and keeping \xe2\x80\x99em with their hands on their hips\r\nlistening to all manner o\xe2\x80\x99 gossip when they should be down on their\r\nknees a-scouring. If we\xe2\x80\x99re to go to ruin, it shanna be wi\xe2\x80\x99 having our\r\nback kitchen turned into a public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire, shifting his tactics and looking as if\r\nhe thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and\r\nleft the room, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can turn the Hollows into feeding-land. I can\r\neasily make another arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall\r\nnot forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a\r\nneighbour. I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three\r\nyears, when the present one expires; otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who\r\nis a man of some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as they\r\ncould be worked so well together. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to part with an old\r\ntenant like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough\r\nto complete Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s exasperation, even without the final threat.\r\nHer husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old\r\nplace where he had been bred and born\xe2\x80\x94for he believed the old squire\r\nhad small spite enough for anything\xe2\x80\x94was beginning a mild remonstrance\r\nexplanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and\r\nsell more stock, with, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I think as it\xe2\x80\x99s rether hard...\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nMrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say\r\nout this once, though it were to rain notices to quit and the only\r\nshelter were the work-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir, if I may speak\xe2\x80\x94as, for all I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman, and there\xe2\x80\x99s folks\r\nas thinks a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fool enough to stan\xe2\x80\x99 by an\xe2\x80\x99 look on while the men\r\nsign her soul away, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to speak, for I make one quarter o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe rent, and save another quarter\xe2\x80\x94I say, if Mr. Thurle\xe2\x80\x99s so ready to\r\ntake farms under you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity but what he should take this, and see\r\nif he likes to live in a house wi\xe2\x80\x99 all the plagues o\xe2\x80\x99 Egypt in\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe cellar full o\xe2\x80\x99 water, and frogs and toads hoppin\xe2\x80\x99 up the steps by\r\ndozens\xe2\x80\x94and the floors rotten, and the rats and mice gnawing every bit\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 cheese, and runnin\xe2\x80\x99 over our heads as we lie i\xe2\x80\x99 bed till we expect\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em to eat us up alive\xe2\x80\x94as it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy they hanna eat the children long\r\nago. I should like to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s another tenant besides Poyser as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 never having a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 repairs done till a place tumbles\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94and not then, on\xe2\x80\x99y wi\xe2\x80\x99 begging and praying and having to pay\r\nhalf\xe2\x80\x94and being strung up wi\xe2\x80\x99 the rent as it\xe2\x80\x99s much if he gets enough\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 the land to pay, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s put his own money into the ground\r\nbeforehand. See if you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a stranger to lead such a life here as\r\nthat: a maggot must be born i\xe2\x80\x99 the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon.\r\nYou may run away from my words, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Poyser, following\r\nthe old squire beyond the door\xe2\x80\x94for after the first moments of stunned\r\nsurprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile,\r\nhad walked out towards his pony. But it was impossible for him to get\r\naway immediately, for John was walking the pony up and down the yard,\r\nand was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinnin\xe2\x80\x99 underhand\r\nways o\xe2\x80\x99 doing us a mischief, for you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Old Harry to your friend,\r\nthough nobody else is, but I tell you for once as we\xe2\x80\x99re not dumb\r\ncreatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha\xe2\x80\x99 got the lash i\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntheir hands, for want o\xe2\x80\x99 knowing how t\xe2\x80\x99 undo the tackle. An\xe2\x80\x99 if I\xe2\x80\x99m th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nonly one as speaks my mind, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 the same way o\xe2\x80\x99 thinking\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 this parish and the next to \xe2\x80\x99t, for your name\xe2\x80\x99s no better than a\r\nbrimstone match in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s nose\xe2\x80\x94if it isna two-three old folks as\r\nyou think o\xe2\x80\x99 saving your soul by giving \xe2\x80\x99em a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 flannel and a drop\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 porridge. An\xe2\x80\x99 you may be right i\xe2\x80\x99 thinking it\xe2\x80\x99ll take but little to\r\nsave your soul, for it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the smallest savin\xe2\x80\x99 y\xe2\x80\x99 iver made, wi\xe2\x80\x99 all\r\nyour scrapin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner may be a\r\nformidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony,\r\neven the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being aware\r\nthat Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he\r\nsuspected that sour old John was grinning behind him\xe2\x80\x94which was also the\r\nfact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsheep-dog, and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the pony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s solo in an impressive\r\nquartet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off than she\r\nturned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them\r\ninto the back kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit again\r\nwith her usual rapidity as she re-entered the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99st done it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and uneasy,\r\nbut not without some triumphant amusement at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my say out,\r\nand I shall be th\xe2\x80\x99 easier for\xe2\x80\x99t all my life. There\xe2\x80\x99s no pleasure i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nliving if you\xe2\x80\x99re to be corked up for ever, and only dribble your mind\r\nout by the sly, like a leaky barrel. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t repent saying what I\r\nthink, if I live to be as old as th\xe2\x80\x99 old squire; and there\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nlikelihood\xe2\x80\x94for it seems as if them as aren\xe2\x80\x99t wanted here are th\xe2\x80\x99 only\r\nfolks as aren\xe2\x80\x99t wanted i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 other world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee wutna like moving from th\xe2\x80\x99 old place, this Michaelmas\r\ntwelvemonth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cand going into a strange parish, where\r\nthee know\xe2\x80\x99st nobody. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be hard upon us both, and upo\xe2\x80\x99 Father too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no use worreting; there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 things may happen between\r\nthis and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be master afore them,\r\nfor what we know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, inclined to take an unusually\r\nhopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought about by her\r\nown merit and not by other people\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ none for worreting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, rising from his\r\nthree-cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should\r\nbe loath to leave th\xe2\x80\x99 old place, and the parish where I was bred and\r\nborn, and Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I\r\ndoubt, and niver thrive again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII\r\nMore Links\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barley was all carried at last, and the harvest suppers went by\r\nwithout waiting for the dismal black crop of beans. The apples and nuts\r\nwere gathered and stored; the scent of whey departed from the\r\nfarm-houses, and the scent of brewing came in its stead. The woods\r\nbehind the Chase, and all the hedgerow trees, took on a solemn\r\nsplendour under the dark low-hanging skies. Michaelmas was come, with\r\nits fragrant basketfuls of purple damsons, and its paler purple\r\ndaisies, and its lads and lasses leaving or seeking service and winding\r\nalong between the yellow hedges, with their bundles under their arms.\r\nBut though Michaelmas was come, Mr. Thurle, that desirable tenant, did\r\nnot come to the Chase Farm, and the old squire, after all, had been\r\nobliged to put in a new bailiff. It was known throughout the two\r\nparishes that the squire\xe2\x80\x99s plan had been frustrated because the Poysers\r\nhad refused to be \xe2\x80\x9cput upon,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak was discussed\r\nin all the farm-houses with a zest which was only heightened by\r\nfrequent repetition. The news that \xe2\x80\x9cBony\xe2\x80\x9d was come back from Egypt was\r\ncomparatively insipid, and the repulse of the French in Italy was\r\nnothing to Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s repulse of the old squire. Mr. Irwine had\r\nheard a version of it in every parishioner\xe2\x80\x99s house, with the one\r\nexception of the Chase. But since he had always, with marvellous skill,\r\navoided any quarrel with Mr. Donnithorne, he could not allow himself\r\nthe pleasure of laughing at the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s discomfiture with any\r\none besides his mother, who declared that if she were rich she should\r\nlike to allow Mrs. Poyser a pension for life, and wanted to invite her\r\nto the parsonage that she might hear an account of the scene from Mrs.\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x99s own lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine; \xe2\x80\x9cit was a little bit of irregular\r\njustice on Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s part, but a magistrate like me must not\r\ncountenance irregular justice. There must be no report spread that I\r\nhave taken notice of the quarrel, else I shall lose the little good\r\ninfluence I have over the old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I like that woman even better than her cream-cheeses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nIrwine. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has the spirit of three men, with that pale face of hers.\r\nAnd she says such sharp things too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSharp! Yes, her tongue is like a new-set razor. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite original\r\nin her talk too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a\r\ncountry with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say\r\nabout Craig\xe2\x80\x94that he was like a cock, who thought the sun had risen to\r\nhear him crow. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s an \xc3\x86sop\xe2\x80\x99s fable in a sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them out of\r\nthe farm next Michaelmas, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Irwine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that must not be; and Poyser is such a good tenant that\r\nDonnithorne is likely to think twice, and digest his spleen rather than\r\nturn them out. But if he should give them notice at Lady Day, Arthur\r\nand I must move heaven and earth to mollify him. Such old parishioners\r\nas they are must not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what may happen before Lady day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nIrwine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt struck me on Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s birthday that the old man was a\r\nlittle shaken: he\xe2\x80\x99s eighty-three, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s really an\r\nunconscionable age. It\xe2\x80\x99s only women who have a right to live as long as\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they\xe2\x80\x99ve got old-bachelor sons who would be forlorn without them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Irwine, laughing, and kissing his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser, too, met her husband\xe2\x80\x99s occasional forebodings of a notice\r\nto quit with \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what may happen before Lady day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof those undeniable general propositions which are usually intended to\r\nconvey a particular meaning very far from undeniable. But it is really\r\ntoo hard upon human nature that it should be held a criminal offence to\r\nimagine the death even of the king when he is turned eighty-three. It\r\nis not to be believed that any but the dullest Britons can be good\r\nsubjects under that hard condition.\r\n\r\nApart from this foreboding, things went on much as usual in the Poyser\r\nhousehold. Mrs. Poyser thought she noticed a surprising improvement in\r\nHetty. To be sure, the girl got \xe2\x80\x9ccloser tempered, and sometimes she\r\nseemed as if there\xe2\x80\x99d be no drawing a word from her with cart-ropes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut she thought much less about her dress, and went after the work\r\nquite eagerly, without any telling. And it was wonderful how she never\r\nwanted to go out now\xe2\x80\x94indeed, could hardly be persuaded to go; and she\r\nbore her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s putting a stop to her weekly lesson in fine-work at the\r\nChase without the least grumbling or pouting. It must be, after all,\r\nthat she had set her heart on Adam at last, and her sudden freak of\r\nwanting to be a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid must have been caused by some little pique\r\nor misunderstanding between them, which had passed by. For whenever\r\nAdam came to the Hall Farm, Hetty seemed to be in better spirits and to\r\ntalk more than at other times, though she was almost sullen when Mr.\r\nCraig or any other admirer happened to pay a visit there.\r\n\r\nAdam himself watched her at first with trembling anxiety, which gave\r\nway to surprise and delicious hope. Five days after delivering Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, he had ventured to go to the Hall Farm again\xe2\x80\x94not without dread\r\nlest the sight of him might be painful to her. She was not in the\r\nhouse-place when he entered, and he sat talking to Mr. and Mrs. Poyser\r\nfor a few minutes with a heavy fear on his heart that they might\r\npresently tell him Hetty was ill. But by and by there came a light step\r\nthat he knew, and when Mrs. Poyser said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Hetty, where have you\r\nbeen?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam was obliged to turn round, though he was afraid to see the\r\nchanged look there must be in her face. He almost started when he saw\r\nher smiling as if she were pleased to see him\xe2\x80\x94looking the same as ever\r\nat a first glance, only that she had her cap on, which he had never\r\nseen her in before when he came of an evening. Still, when he looked at\r\nher again and again as she moved about or sat at her work, there was a\r\nchange: the cheeks were as pink as ever, and she smiled as much as she\r\nhad ever done of late, but there was something different in her eyes,\r\nin the expression of her face, in all her movements, Adam\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94something harder, older, less child-like. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s allays likely. It\xe2\x80\x99s because she\xe2\x80\x99s had her first\r\nheartache. But she\xe2\x80\x99s got a spirit to bear up under it. Thank God for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, and he saw her always looking pleased to see\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94turning up her lovely face towards him as if she meant him to\r\nunderstand that she was glad for him to come\xe2\x80\x94and going about her work\r\nin the same equable way, making no sign of sorrow, he began to believe\r\nthat her feeling towards Arthur must have been much slighter than he\r\nhad imagined in his first indignation and alarm, and that she had been\r\nable to think of her girlish fancy that Arthur was in love with her and\r\nwould marry her as a folly of which she was timely cured. And it\r\nperhaps was, as he had sometimes in his more cheerful moments hoped it\r\nwould be\xe2\x80\x94her heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards\r\nthe man she knew to have a serious love for her.\r\n\r\nPossibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his\r\ninterpretations, and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a\r\nsensible man to behave as he did\xe2\x80\x94falling in love with a girl who really\r\nhad nothing more than her beauty to recommend her, attributing\r\nimaginary virtues to her, and even condescending to cleave to her after\r\nshe had fallen in love with another man, waiting for her kind looks as\r\na patient trembling dog waits for his master\xe2\x80\x99s eye to be turned upon\r\nhim. But in so complex a thing as human nature, we must consider, it is\r\nhard to find rules without exceptions. Of course, I know that, as a\r\nrule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their\r\nacquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty,\r\nnever imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on\r\nall proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every\r\nrespect\xe2\x80\x94indeed, so as to compel the approbation of all the maiden\r\nladies in their neighbourhood. But even to this rule an exception will\r\noccur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and my friend Adam was\r\none. For my own part, however, I respect him none the less\xe2\x80\x94nay, I think\r\nthe deep love he had for that sweet, rounded, blossom-like, dark-eyed\r\nHetty, of whose inward self he was really very ignorant, came out of\r\nthe very strength of his nature and not out of any inconsistent\r\nweakness. Is it any weakness, pray, to be wrought on by exquisite\r\nmusic? To feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings\r\nof your soul, the delicate fibres of life where no memory can\r\npenetrate, and binding together your whole being past and present in\r\none unspeakable vibration, melting you in one moment with all the\r\ntenderness, all the love that has been scattered through the toilsome\r\nyears, concentrating in one emotion of heroic courage or resignation\r\nall the hard-learnt lessons of self-renouncing sympathy, blending your\r\npresent joy with past sorrow and your present sorrow with all your past\r\njoy? If not, then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by the\r\nexquisite curves of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and neck and arms, by the liquid\r\ndepths of her beseeching eyes, or the sweet childish pout of her lips.\r\nFor the beauty of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more?\r\nBeauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman\xe2\x80\x99s soul that\r\nit clothes, as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the\r\nthought that prompted them. It is more than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love that moves\r\nus in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94it seems to be a far-off mighty love that has come\r\nnear to us, and made speech for itself there; the rounded neck, the\r\ndimpled arm, move us by something more than their prettiness\xe2\x80\x94by their\r\nclose kinship with all we have known of tenderness and peace. The\r\nnoblest nature sees the most of this _impersonal_ expression in beauty\r\n(it is needless to say that there are gentlemen with whiskers dyed and\r\nundyed who see none of it whatever), and for this reason, the noblest\r\nnature is often the most blinded to the character of the one woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul that the beauty clothes. Whence, I fear, the tragedy of human life\r\nis likely to continue for a long time to come, in spite of mental\r\nphilosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all\r\nmistakes of the kind.\r\n\r\nOur good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for\r\nHetty: he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of\r\nknowledge; he called his love frankly a mystery, as you have heard him.\r\nHe only knew that the sight and memory of her moved him deeply,\r\ntouching the spring of all love and tenderness, all faith and courage\r\nwithin him. How could he imagine narrowness, selfishness, hardness in\r\nher? He created the mind he believed in out of his own, which was\r\nlarge, unselfish, tender.\r\n\r\nThe hopes he felt about Hetty softened a little his feeling towards\r\nArthur. Surely his attentions to Hetty must have been of a slight kind;\r\nthey were altogether wrong, and such as no man in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s position\r\nought to have allowed himself, but they must have had an air of\r\nplayfulness about them, which had probably blinded him to their danger\r\nand had prevented them from laying any strong hold on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s heart. As\r\nthe new promise of happiness rose for Adam, his indignation and\r\njealousy began to die out. Hetty was not made unhappy; he almost\r\nbelieved that she liked him best; and the thought sometimes crossed his\r\nmind that the friendship which had once seemed dead for ever might\r\nrevive in the days to come, and he would not have to say \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nthe grand old woods, but would like them better because they were\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s. For this new promise of happiness following so quickly on the\r\nshock of pain had an intoxicating effect on the sober Adam, who had all\r\nhis life been used to much hardship and moderate hope. Was he really\r\ngoing to have an easy lot after all? It seemed so, for at the beginning\r\nof November, Jonathan Burge, finding it impossible to replace Adam, had\r\nat last made up his mind to offer him a share in the business, without\r\nfurther condition than that he should continue to give his energies to\r\nit and renounce all thought of having a separate business of his own.\r\nSon-in-law or no son-in-law, Adam had made himself too necessary to be\r\nparted with, and his headwork was so much more important to Burge than\r\nhis skill in handicraft that his having the management of the woods\r\nmade little difference in the value of his services; and as to the\r\nbargains about the squire\xe2\x80\x99s timber, it would be easy to call in a third\r\nperson. Adam saw here an opening into a broadening path of prosperous\r\nwork such as he had thought of with ambitious longing ever since he was\r\na lad: he might come to build a bridge, or a town hall, or a factory,\r\nfor he had always said to himself that Jonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s building\r\nbusiness was like an acorn, which might be the mother of a great tree.\r\nSo he gave his hand to Burge on that bargain, and went home with his\r\nmind full of happy visions, in which (my refined reader will perhaps be\r\nshocked when I say it) the image of Hetty hovered, and smiled over\r\nplans for seasoning timber at a trifling expense, calculations as to\r\nthe cheapening of bricks per thousand by water-carriage, and a\r\nfavourite scheme for the strengthening of roofs and walls with a\r\npeculiar form of iron girder. What then? Adam\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm lay in these\r\nthings; and our love is inwrought in our enthusiasm as electricity is\r\ninwrought in the air, exalting its power by a subtle presence.\r\n\r\nAdam would be able to take a separate house now, and provide for his\r\nmother in the old one; his prospects would justify his marrying very\r\nsoon, and if Dinah consented to have Seth, their mother would perhaps\r\nbe more contented to live apart from Adam. But he told himself that he\r\nwould not be hasty\xe2\x80\x94he would not try Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s feeling for him until it\r\nhad had time to grow strong and firm. However, tomorrow, after church,\r\nhe would go to the Hall Farm and tell them the news. Mr. Poyser, he\r\nknew, would like it better than a five-pound note, and he should see if\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s eyes brightened at it. The months would be short with all he\r\nhad to fill his mind, and this foolish eagerness which had come over\r\nhim of late must not hurry him into any premature words. Yet when he\r\ngot home and told his mother the good news, and ate his supper, while\r\nshe sat by almost crying for joy and wanting him to eat twice as much\r\nas usual because of this good-luck, he could not help preparing her\r\ngently for the coming change by talking of the old house being too\r\nsmall for them all to go on living in it always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV\r\nThe Betrothal\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dry Sunday, and really a pleasant day for the 2d of November.\r\nThere was no sunshine, but the clouds were high, and the wind was so\r\nstill that the yellow leaves which fluttered down from the hedgerow\r\nelms must have fallen from pure decay. Nevertheless, Mrs. Poyser did\r\nnot go to church, for she had taken a cold too serious to be neglected;\r\nonly two winters ago she had been laid up for weeks with a cold; and\r\nsince his wife did not go to church, Mr. Poyser considered that on the\r\nwhole it would be as well for him to stay away too and \xe2\x80\x9ckeep her\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d He could perhaps have given no precise form to the reasons\r\nthat determined this conclusion, but it is well known to all\r\nexperienced minds that our firmest convictions are often dependent on\r\nsubtle impressions for which words are quite too coarse a medium.\r\nHowever it was, no one from the Poyser family went to church that\r\nafternoon except Hetty and the boys; yet Adam was bold enough to join\r\nthem after church, and say that he would walk home with them, though\r\nall the way through the village he appeared to be chiefly occupied with\r\nMarty and Tommy, telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice,\r\nand promising to take them there some day. But when they came to the\r\nfields he said to the boys, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, which is the stoutest walker?\r\nHim as gets to th\xe2\x80\x99 home-gate first shall be the first to go with me to\r\nBinton Coppice on the donkey. But Tommy must have the start up to the\r\nnext stile, because he\xe2\x80\x99s the smallest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before. As soon\r\nas the boys had both set off, he looked down at Hetty and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou hang on my arm, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d in a pleading tone, as if he had already\r\nasked her and she had refused. Hetty looked up at him smilingly and put\r\nher round arm through his in a moment. It was nothing to her, putting\r\nher arm through Adam\xe2\x80\x99s, but she knew he cared a great deal about having\r\nher arm through his, and she wished him to care. Her heart beat no\r\nfaster, and she looked at the half-bare hedgerows and the ploughed\r\nfield with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before. But Adam\r\nscarcely felt that he was walking. He thought Hetty must know that he\r\nwas pressing her arm a little\xe2\x80\x94a very little. Words rushed to his lips\r\nthat he dared not utter\xe2\x80\x94that he had made up his mind not to utter\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94and so he was silent for the length of that field. The calm\r\npatience with which he had once waited for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s love, content only\r\nwith her presence and the thought of the future, had forsaken him since\r\nthat terrible shock nearly three months ago. The agitations of jealousy\r\nhad given a new restlessness to his passion\xe2\x80\x94had made fear and\r\nuncertainty too hard almost to bear. But though he might not speak to\r\nHetty of his love, he would tell her about his new prospects and see if\r\nshe would be pleased. So when he was enough master of himself to talk,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell your uncle some news that\xe2\x80\x99ll surprise him,\r\nHetty; and I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to hear it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty said indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a change in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face, certainly not produced by any\r\nagreeable impression from this news. In fact she felt a momentary\r\nannoyance and alarm, for she had so often heard it hinted by her uncle\r\nthat Adam might have Mary Burge and a share in the business any day, if\r\nhe liked, that she associated the two objects now, and the thought\r\nimmediately occurred that perhaps Adam had given her up because of what\r\nhad happened lately, and had turned towards Mary Burge. With that\r\nthought, and before she had time to remember any reasons why it could\r\nnot be true, came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment. The\r\none thing\xe2\x80\x94the one person\xe2\x80\x94her mind had rested on in its dull weariness,\r\nhad slipped away from her, and peevish misery filled her eyes with\r\ntears. She was looking on the ground, but Adam saw her face, saw the\r\ntears, and before he had finished saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHetty, dear Hetty, what are\r\nyou crying for?\xe2\x80\x9d his eager rapid thought had flown through all the\r\ncauses conceivable to him, and had at last alighted on half the true\r\none. Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary Burge\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him\r\nto marry\xe2\x80\x94perhaps she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him to marry any one but herself? All\r\ncaution was swept away\xe2\x80\x94all reason for it was gone, and Adam could feel\r\nnothing but trembling joy. He leaned towards her and took her hand, as\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could afford to be married now, Hetty\xe2\x80\x94I could make a wife\r\ncomfortable; but I shall never want to be married if you won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to\r\nArthur that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not\r\ncoming, and yet he came. It was a feebler relief, a feebler triumph she\r\nfelt now, but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as beautiful\r\nas ever, perhaps more beautiful, for there was a more luxuriant\r\nwomanliness about Hetty of late. Adam could hardly believe in the\r\nhappiness of that moment. His right hand held her left, and he pressed\r\nher arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really love me, Hetty? Will you be my own wife, to love and\r\ntake care of as long as I live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty did not speak, but Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face was very close to hers, and she\r\nput up her round cheek against his, like a kitten. She wanted to be\r\ncaressed\xe2\x80\x94she wanted to feel as if Arthur were with her again.\r\n\r\nAdam cared for no words after that, and they hardly spoke through the\r\nrest of the walk. He only said, \xe2\x80\x9cI may tell your uncle and aunt, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI, Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red fire-light on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful faces\r\nthat evening, when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam took the\r\nopportunity of telling Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and the grandfather that he\r\nsaw his way to maintaining a wife now, and that Hetty had consented to\r\nhave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have no objections against me for her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a poor man as yet, but she shall want nothing as I can work for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObjections?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, while the grandfather leaned forward and\r\nbrought out his long \xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat objections can we ha\xe2\x80\x99 to you,\r\nlad? Never mind your being poorish as yet; there\xe2\x80\x99s money in your\r\nhead-piece as there\xe2\x80\x99s money i\xe2\x80\x99 the sown field, but it must ha\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99n got enough to begin on, and we can do a deal tow\xe2\x80\x99rt the bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfurniture you\xe2\x80\x99ll want. Thee\xe2\x80\x99st got feathers and linen to spare\xe2\x80\x94plenty,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question was of course addressed to Mrs. Poyser, who was wrapped\r\nup in a warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her usual facility.\r\nAt first she only nodded emphatically, but she was presently unable to\r\nresist the temptation to be more explicit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nhoarsely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I never sell a fowl but what\xe2\x80\x99s plucked, and the wheel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-going every day o\xe2\x80\x99 the week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my wench,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and kiss\r\nus, and let us wish you luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, patting her on the back, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and kiss your aunt and\r\nyour grandfather. I\xe2\x80\x99m as wishful t\xe2\x80\x99 have you settled well as if you was\r\nmy own daughter; and so\xe2\x80\x99s your aunt, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, for she\xe2\x80\x99s done by\r\nyou this seven \xe2\x80\x99ear, Hetty, as if you\xe2\x80\x99d been her own. Come, come, now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe went on, becoming jocose, as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and\r\nthe old man, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam wants a kiss too, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a right to\r\none now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty turned away, smiling, towards her empty chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Adam, then, take one,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9celse y\xe2\x80\x99 arena half\r\na man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam got up, blushing like a small maiden\xe2\x80\x94great strong fellow as he\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94and, putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty scene in the red fire-light; for there were no\r\ncandles\xe2\x80\x94why should there be, when the fire was so bright and was\r\nreflected from all the pewter and the polished oak? No one wanted to\r\nwork on a Sunday evening. Even Hetty felt something like contentment in\r\nthe midst of all this love. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s attachment to her, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s caress,\r\nstirred no passion in her, were no longer enough to satisfy her vanity,\r\nbut they were the best her life offered her now\xe2\x80\x94they promised her some\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away, about the\r\npossibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in.\r\nNo house was empty except the one next to Will Maskery\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nvillage, and that was too small for Adam now. Mr. Poyser insisted that\r\nthe best plan would be for Seth and his mother to move and leave Adam\r\nin the old home, which might be enlarged after a while, for there was\r\nplenty of space in the woodyard and garden; but Adam objected to\r\nturning his mother out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwe needna fix everything\r\nto-night. We must take time to consider. You canna think o\xe2\x80\x99 getting\r\nmarried afore Easter. I\xe2\x80\x99m not for long courtships, but there must be a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 time to make things comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, in a hoarse whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cChristian\r\nfolks can\xe2\x80\x99t be married like cuckoos, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a bit daunted, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I think as we may\r\nhave notice to quit, and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, staring at the floor and lifting his hands up\r\nand down, while his arms rested on the elbows of his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npoor tale if I mun leave th\xe2\x80\x99 ould spot an be buried in a strange\r\nparish. An\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ll happen ha\xe2\x80\x99 double rates to pay,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking\r\nup at his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thee mustna fret beforehand, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin the younger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappen the captain \xe2\x80\x99ull come home and make our peace wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 old\r\nsquire. I build upo\xe2\x80\x99 that, for I know the captain \xe2\x80\x99ll see folks righted\r\nif he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV\r\nThe Hidden Dread\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a busy time for Adam\xe2\x80\x94the time between the beginning of November\r\nand the beginning of February, and he could see little of Hetty, except\r\non Sundays. But a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him\r\nnearer and nearer to March, when they were to be married, and all the\r\nlittle preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress\r\ntowards the longed-for day. Two new rooms had been \xe2\x80\x9crun up\xe2\x80\x9d to the old\r\nhouse, for his mother and Seth were to live with them after all.\r\nLisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he\r\nhad gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put\r\nup with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s ways and consent to live with her. To his great\r\ndelight, Hetty said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon she lived with us as not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s mind was oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty than\r\npoor Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s ways; she could not care about them. So Adam was\r\nconsoled for the disappointment he had felt when Seth had come back\r\nfrom his visit to Snowfield and said \xe2\x80\x9cit was no use\xe2\x80\x94Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s heart wasna\r\nturned towards marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d For when he told his mother that Hetty was\r\nwilling they should all live together and there was no more need of\r\nthem to think of parting, she said, in a more contented tone than he\r\nhad heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be\r\nmarried, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, my lad, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as still as th\xe2\x80\x99 ould tabby, an\xe2\x80\x99 ne\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nwant to do aught but th\xe2\x80\x99 offal work, as _she_ wonna like t\xe2\x80\x99 do. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthen we needna part the platters an\xe2\x80\x99 things, as ha\xe2\x80\x99 stood on the shelf\r\ntogether sin\xe2\x80\x99 afore thee wast born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was only one cloud that now and then came across Adam\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine:\r\nHetty seemed unhappy sometimes. But to all his anxious, tender\r\nquestions, she replied with an assurance that she was quite contented\r\nand wished nothing different; and the next time he saw her she was more\r\nlively than usual. It might be that she was a little overdone with work\r\nand anxiety now, for soon after Christmas Mrs. Poyser had taken another\r\ncold, which had brought on inflammation, and this illness had confined\r\nher to her room all through January. Hetty had to manage everything\r\ndownstairs, and half-supply Molly\xe2\x80\x99s place too, while that good damsel\r\nwaited on her mistress, and she seemed to throw herself so entirely\r\ninto her new functions, working with a grave steadiness which was new\r\nin her, that Mr. Poyser often told Adam she was wanting to show him\r\nwhat a good housekeeper he would have; but he \xe2\x80\x9cdoubted the lass was\r\no\xe2\x80\x99erdoing it\xe2\x80\x94she must have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 rest when her aunt could come\r\ndownstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis desirable event of Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s coming downstairs happened in the\r\nearly part of February, when some mild weather thawed the last patch of\r\nsnow on the Binton Hills. On one of these days, soon after her aunt\r\ncame down, Hetty went to Treddleston to buy some of the wedding things\r\nwhich were wanting, and which Mrs. Poyser had scolded her for\r\nneglecting, observing that she supposed \xe2\x80\x9cit was because they were not\r\nfor th\xe2\x80\x99 outside, else she\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 bought \xe2\x80\x99em fast enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Hetty set off, and the slight hoar-frost\r\nthat had whitened the hedges in the early morning had disappeared as\r\nthe sun mounted the cloudless sky. Bright February days have a stronger\r\ncharm of hope about them than any other days in the year. One likes to\r\npause in the mild rays of the sun, and look over the gates at the\r\npatient plough-horses turning at the end of the furrow, and think that\r\nthe beautiful year is all before one. The birds seem to feel just the\r\nsame: their notes are as clear as the clear air. There are no leaves on\r\nthe trees and hedgerows, but how green all the grassy fields are! And\r\nthe dark purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches\r\nis beautiful too. What a glad world this looks like, as one drives or\r\nrides along the valleys and over the hills! I have often thought so\r\nwhen, in foreign countries, where the fields and woods have looked to\r\nme like our English Loamshire\xe2\x80\x94the rich land tilled with just as much\r\ncare, the woods rolling down the gentle slopes to the green meadows\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave come on something by the roadside which has reminded me that I am\r\nnot in Loamshire: an image of a great agony\xe2\x80\x94the agony of the Cross. It\r\nhas stood perhaps by the clustering apple-blossoms, or in the broad\r\nsunshine by the cornfield, or at a turning by the wood where a clear\r\nbrook was gurgling below; and surely, if there came a traveller to this\r\nworld who knew nothing of the story of man\xe2\x80\x99s life upon it, this image\r\nof agony would seem to him strangely out of place in the midst of this\r\njoyous nature. He would not know that hidden behind the apple-blossoms,\r\nor among the golden corn, or under the shrouding boughs of the wood,\r\nthere might be a human heart beating heavily with anguish\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a\r\nyoung blooming girl, not knowing where to turn for refuge from\r\nswift-advancing shame, understanding no more of this life of ours than\r\na foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on\r\nthe lonely heath, yet tasting the bitterest of life\xe2\x80\x99s bitterness.\r\n\r\nSuch things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and behind the\r\nblossoming orchards; and the sound of the gurgling brook, if you came\r\nclose to one spot behind a small bush, would be mingled for your ear\r\nwith a despairing human sob. No wonder man\xe2\x80\x99s religion has much sorrow\r\nin it: no wonder he needs a suffering God.\r\n\r\nHetty, in her red cloak and warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand,\r\nis turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston road, but not\r\nthat she may have a more lingering enjoyment of the sunshine and think\r\nwith hope of the long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is\r\nshining; and for weeks, now, when she has hoped at all, it has been for\r\nsomething at which she herself trembles and shudders. She only wants to\r\nbe out of the high-road, that she may walk slowly and not care how her\r\nface looks, as she dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate\r\nshe can get into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her\r\ngreat dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who\r\nis desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave\r\ntender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept\r\naway in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile\r\nthe pathway branches off: there are two roads before her\xe2\x80\x94one along by\r\nthe hedgerow, which will by and by lead her into the road again, the\r\nother across the fields, which will take her much farther out of the\r\nway into the Scantlands, low shrouded pastures where she will see\r\nnobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster, as if she\r\nhad suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to\r\nhasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes\r\ngradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the\r\nslope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she\r\nis making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a\r\ndark shrouded pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs\r\nof the elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the\r\ngrassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over\r\nthe dark pool. She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the\r\nmonth that has just gone by, and now at last she is come to see it. She\r\nclasps her hands round her knees, and leans forward, and looks\r\nearnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make\r\nfor her young round limbs.\r\n\r\nNo, she has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed, and if she\r\nhad, they might find her\xe2\x80\x94they might find out why she had drowned\r\nherself. There is but one thing left to her: she must go away, go where\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t find her.\r\n\r\nAfter the first on-coming of her great dread, some weeks after her\r\nbetrothal to Adam, she had waited and waited, in the blind vague hope\r\nthat something would happen to set her free from her terror; but she\r\ncould wait no longer. All the force of her nature had been concentrated\r\non the one effort of concealment, and she had shrunk with irresistible\r\ndread from every course that could tend towards a betrayal of her\r\nmiserable secret. Whenever the thought of writing to Arthur had\r\noccurred to her, she had rejected it. He could do nothing for her that\r\nwould shelter her from discovery and scorn among the relatives and\r\nneighbours who once more made all her world, now her airy dream had\r\nvanished. Her imagination no longer saw happiness with Arthur, for he\r\ncould do nothing that would satisfy or soothe her pride. No, something\r\nelse would happen\xe2\x80\x94something _must_ happen\xe2\x80\x94to set her free from this\r\ndread. In young, childish, ignorant souls there is constantly this\r\nblind trust in some unshapen chance: it is as hard to a boy or girl to\r\nbelieve that a great wretchedness will actually befall them as to\r\nbelieve that they will die.\r\n\r\nBut now necessity was pressing hard upon her\xe2\x80\x94now the time of her\r\nmarriage was close at hand\xe2\x80\x94she could no longer rest in this blind\r\ntrust. She must run away; she must hide herself where no familiar eyes\r\ncould detect her; and then the terror of wandering out into the world,\r\nof which she knew nothing, made the possibility of going to Arthur a\r\nthought which brought some comfort with it. She felt so helpless now,\r\nso unable to fashion the future for herself, that the prospect of\r\nthrowing herself on him had a relief in it which was stronger than her\r\npride. As she sat by the pool and shuddered at the dark cold water, the\r\nhope that he would receive her tenderly\xe2\x80\x94that he would care for her and\r\nthink for her\xe2\x80\x94was like a sense of lulling warmth, that made her for the\r\nmoment indifferent to everything else; and she began now to think of\r\nnothing but the scheme by which she should get away.\r\n\r\nShe had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the\r\ncoming marriage, which she had heard of from Seth; and when Hetty had\r\nread this letter aloud to her uncle, he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Dinah \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\ncome again now, for she\xe2\x80\x99d be a comfort to your aunt when you\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\r\nWhat do you think, my wench, o\xe2\x80\x99 going to see her as soon as you can be\r\nspared and persuading her to come back wi\xe2\x80\x99 you? You might happen\r\npersuade her wi\xe2\x80\x99 telling her as her aunt wants her, for all she writes\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 not being able to come.\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty had not liked the thought of going to\r\nSnowfield, and felt no longing to see Dinah, so she only said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nfar off, Uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d But now she thought this proposed visit would serve as\r\na pretext for going away. She would tell her aunt when she got home\r\nagain that she should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week\r\nor ten days. And then, when she got to Stoniton, where nobody knew her,\r\nshe would ask for the coach that would take her on the way to Windsor.\r\nArthur was at Windsor, and she would go to him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme, she rose from the\r\ngrassy bank of the pool, took up her basket, and went on her way to\r\nTreddleston, for she must buy the wedding things she had come out for,\r\nthough she would never want them. She must be careful not to raise any\r\nsuspicion that she was going to run away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to go and\r\nsee Dinah and try to bring her back to stay over the wedding. The\r\nsooner she went the better, since the weather was pleasant now; and\r\nAdam, when he came in the evening, said, if Hetty could set off\r\nto-morrow, he would make time to go with her to Treddleston and see her\r\nsafe into the Stoniton coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could go with you and take care of you, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, the\r\nnext morning, leaning in at the coach door; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you won\xe2\x80\x99t stay much\r\nbeyond a week\xe2\x80\x94the time \xe2\x80\x99ull seem long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her fondly, and his strong hand held hers in its\r\ngrasp. Hetty felt a sense of protection in his presence\xe2\x80\x94she was used to\r\nit now: if she could have had the past undone and known no other love\r\nthan her quiet liking for Adam! The tears rose as she gave him the last\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless her for loving me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, as he went on his way to work\r\nagain, with Gyp at his heels.\r\n\r\nBut Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s tears were not for Adam\xe2\x80\x94not for the anguish that would come\r\nupon him when he found she was gone from him for ever. They were for\r\nthe misery of her own lot, which took her away from this brave tender\r\nman who offered up his whole life to her, and threw her, a poor\r\nhelpless suppliant, on the man who would think it a misfortune that she\r\nwas obliged to cling to him.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock that day, when Hetty was on the coach that was to take\r\nher, they said, to Leicester\xe2\x80\x94part of the long, long way to Windsor\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nfelt dimly that she might be travelling all this weary journey towards\r\nthe beginning of new misery.\r\n\r\nYet Arthur was at Windsor; he would surely not be angry with her. If he\r\ndid not mind about her as he used to do, he had promised to be good to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Fifth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI\r\nThe Journey of Hope\r\n\r\n\r\nA long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from the\r\nfamiliar to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing even to the\r\nrich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing, even when we are called\r\nby duty, not urged by dread.\r\n\r\nWhat was it then to Hetty? With her poor narrow thoughts, no longer\r\nmelting into vague hopes, but pressed upon by the chill of definite\r\nfear, repeating again and again the same small round of\r\nmemories\xe2\x80\x94shaping again and again the same childish, doubtful images of\r\nwhat was to come\xe2\x80\x94seeing nothing in this wide world but the little\r\nhistory of her own pleasures and pains; with so little money in her\r\npocket, and the way so long and difficult. Unless she could afford\r\nalways to go in the coaches\xe2\x80\x94and she felt sure she could not, for the\r\njourney to Stoniton was more expensive than she had expected\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nplain that she must trust to carriers\xe2\x80\x99 carts or slow waggons; and what\r\na time it would be before she could get to the end of her journey! The\r\nburly old coachman from Oakbourne, seeing such a pretty young woman\r\namong the outside passengers, had invited her to come and sit beside\r\nhim; and feeling that it became him as a man and a coachman to open the\r\ndialogue with a joke, he applied himself as soon as they were off the\r\nstones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects. After many\r\ncuts with his whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of his eye,\r\nhe lifted his lips above the edge of his wrapper and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\r\nnigh six foot, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, isna he, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, rather startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the sweetheart as you\xe2\x80\x99ve left behind, or else him as you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\narter\xe2\x80\x94which is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty felt her face flushing and then turning pale. She thought this\r\ncoachman must know something about her. He must know Adam, and might\r\ntell him where she was gone, for it is difficult to country people to\r\nbelieve that those who make a figure in their own parish are not known\r\neverywhere else, and it was equally difficult to Hetty to understand\r\nthat chance words could happen to apply closely to her circumstances.\r\nShe was too frightened to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, hegh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman, seeing that his joke was not so\r\ngratifying as he had expected, \xe2\x80\x9cyou munna take it too ser\xe2\x80\x99ous; if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehaved ill, get another. Such a pretty lass as you can get a\r\nsweetheart any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty\xe2\x80\x99s fear was allayed by and by, when she found that the coachman\r\nmade no further allusion to her personal concerns; but it still had the\r\neffect of preventing her from asking him what were the places on the\r\nroad to Windsor. She told him she was only going a little way out of\r\nStoniton, and when she got down at the inn where the coach stopped, she\r\nhastened away with her basket to another part of the town. When she had\r\nformed her plan of going to Windsor, she had not foreseen any\r\ndifficulties except that of getting away, and after she had overcome\r\nthis by proposing the visit to Dinah, her thoughts flew to the meeting\r\nwith Arthur and the question how he would behave to her\xe2\x80\x94not resting on\r\nany probable incidents of the journey. She was too entirely ignorant of\r\ntraveling to imagine any of its details, and with all her store of\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94her three guineas\xe2\x80\x94in her pocket, she thought herself amply\r\nprovided. It was not until she found how much it cost her to get to\r\nStoniton that she began to be alarmed about the journey, and then, for\r\nthe first time, she felt her ignorance as to the places that must be\r\npassed on her way. Oppressed with this new alarm, she walked along the\r\ngrim Stoniton streets, and at last turned into a shabby little inn,\r\nwhere she hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night. Here she asked\r\nthe landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to, to get to\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t rightly say. Windsor must be pretty nigh London, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s where the king lives,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, you\xe2\x80\x99d best go t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAshby next\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s south\xe2\x80\x99ard. But there\xe2\x80\x99s as many places from here to\r\nLondon as there\xe2\x80\x99s houses in Stoniton, by what I can make out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever been no traveller myself. But how comes a lone young woman like\r\nyou to be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 taking such a journey as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to my brother\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a soldier at Windsor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty,\r\nfrightened at the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s questioning look. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go by\r\nthe coach; do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a cart goes toward Ashby in the\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from; but\r\nyou might run over the town before you found out. You\xe2\x80\x99d best set off\r\nand walk, and trust to summat overtaking you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery word sank like lead on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s spirits; she saw the journey\r\nstretch bit by bit before her now. Even to get to Ashby seemed a hard\r\nthing: it might take the day, for what she knew, and that was nothing\r\nto the rest of the journey. But it must be done\xe2\x80\x94she must get to Arthur.\r\nOh, how she yearned to be again with somebody who would care for her!\r\nShe who had never got up in the morning without the certainty of seeing\r\nfamiliar faces, people on whom she had an acknowledged claim; whose\r\nfarthest journey had been to Rosseter on the pillion with her uncle;\r\nwhose thoughts had always been taking holiday in dreams of pleasure,\r\nbecause all the business of her life was managed for her\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nkittenlike Hetty, who till a few months ago had never felt any other\r\ngrief than that of envying Mary Burge a new ribbon, or being girded at\r\nby her aunt for neglecting Totty, must now make her toilsome way in\r\nloneliness, her peaceful home left behind for ever, and nothing but a\r\ntremulous hope of distant refuge before her. Now for the first time, as\r\nshe lay down to-night in the strange hard bed, she felt that her home\r\nhad been a happy one, that her uncle had been very good to her, that\r\nher quiet lot at Hayslope among the things and people she knew, with\r\nher little pride in her one best gown and bonnet, and nothing to hide\r\nfrom any one, was what she would like to wake up to as a reality, and\r\nfind that all the feverish life she had known besides was a short\r\nnightmare. She thought of all she had left behind with yearning regret\r\nfor her own sake. Her own misery filled her heart\xe2\x80\x94there was no room in\r\nit for other people\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow. And yet, before the cruel letter, Arthur\r\nhad been so tender and loving. The memory of that had still a charm for\r\nher, though it was no more than a soothing draught that just made pain\r\nbearable. For Hetty could conceive no other existence for herself in\r\nfuture than a hidden one, and a hidden life, even with love, would have\r\nhad no delights for her; still less a life mingled with shame. She knew\r\nno romances, and had only a feeble share in the feelings which are the\r\nsource of romance, so that well-read ladies may find it difficult to\r\nunderstand her state of mind. She was too ignorant of everything beyond\r\nthe simple notions and habits in which she had been brought up to have\r\nany more definite idea of her probable future than that Arthur would\r\ntake care of her somehow, and shelter her from anger and scorn. He\r\nwould not marry her and make her a lady; and apart from that she could\r\nthink of nothing he could give towards which she looked with longing\r\nand ambition.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she rose early, and taking only some milk and bread\r\nfor her breakfast, set out to walk on the road towards Ashby, under a\r\nleaden-coloured sky, with a narrowing streak of yellow, like a\r\ndeparting hope, on the edge of the horizon. Now in her faintness of\r\nheart at the length and difficulty of her journey, she was most of all\r\nafraid of spending her money, and becoming so destitute that she would\r\nhave to ask people\xe2\x80\x99s charity; for Hetty had the pride not only of a\r\nproud nature but of a proud class\xe2\x80\x94the class that pays the most\r\npoor-rates, and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poor-rate.\r\nIt had not yet occurred to her that she might get money for her locket\r\nand earrings which she carried with her, and she applied all her small\r\narithmetic and knowledge of prices to calculating how many meals and\r\nhow many rides were contained in her two guineas, and the odd\r\nshillings, which had a melancholy look, as if they were the pale ashes\r\nof the other bright-flaming coin.\r\n\r\nFor the first few miles out of Stoniton, she walked on bravely, always\r\nfixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant\r\nvisible point in the road as a goal, and feeling a faint joy when she\r\nhad reached it. But when she came to the fourth milestone, the first\r\nshe had happened to notice among the long grass by the roadside, and\r\nread that she was still only four miles beyond Stoniton, her courage\r\nsank. She had come only this little way, and yet felt tired, and almost\r\nhungry again in the keen morning air; for though Hetty was accustomed\r\nto much movement and exertion indoors, she was not used to long walks\r\nwhich produced quite a different sort of fatigue from that of household\r\nactivity. As she was looking at the milestone she felt some drops\r\nfalling on her face\xe2\x80\x94it was beginning to rain. Here was a new trouble\r\nwhich had not entered into her sad thoughts before, and quite weighed\r\ndown by this sudden addition to her burden, she sat down on the step of\r\na stile and began to sob hysterically. The beginning of hardship is\r\nlike the first taste of bitter food\xe2\x80\x94it seems for a moment unbearable;\r\nyet, if there is nothing else to satisfy our hunger, we take another\r\nbite and find it possible to go on. When Hetty recovered from her burst\r\nof weeping, she rallied her fainting courage: it was raining, and she\r\nmust try to get on to a village where she might find rest and shelter.\r\nPresently, as she walked on wearily, she heard the rumbling of heavy\r\nwheels behind her; a covered waggon was coming, creeping slowly along\r\nwith a slouching driver cracking his whip beside the horses. She waited\r\nfor it, thinking that if the waggoner were not a very sour-looking man,\r\nshe would ask him to take her up. As the waggon approached her, the\r\ndriver had fallen behind, but there was something in the front of the\r\nbig vehicle which encouraged her. At any previous moment in her life\r\nshe would not have noticed it, but now, the new susceptibility that\r\nsuffering had awakened in her caused this object to impress her\r\nstrongly. It was only a small white-and-liver-coloured spaniel which\r\nsat on the front ledge of the waggon, with large timid eyes, and an\r\nincessant trembling in the body, such as you may have seen in some of\r\nthese small creatures. Hetty cared little for animals, as you know, but\r\nat this moment she felt as if the helpless timid creature had some\r\nfellowship with her, and without being quite aware of the reason, she\r\nwas less doubtful about speaking to the driver, who now came forward\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlarge ruddy man, with a sack over his shoulders, by way of scarf or\r\nmantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you take me up in your waggon, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going towards Ashby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hetty. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big fellow, with that slowly dawning smile which belongs\r\nto heavy faces, \xe2\x80\x9cI can take y\xe2\x80\x99 up fawst enough wi\xe2\x80\x99out bein\xe2\x80\x99 paid for\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nif you dooant mind lyin\xe2\x80\x99 a bit closish a-top o\xe2\x80\x99 the wool-packs. Where\r\ndo you coom from? And what do you want at Ashby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from Stoniton. I\xe2\x80\x99m going a long way\xe2\x80\x94to Windsor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Arter some service, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to my brother\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a soldier there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m going no furder nor Leicester\xe2\x80\x94and fur enough too\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake you, if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road. Th\xe2\x80\x99 hosses\r\nwooant feel _your_ weight no more nor they feel the little doog there,\r\nas I puck up on the road a fortni\xe2\x80\x99t agoo. He war lost, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, an\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen all of a tremble iver sin\xe2\x80\x99. Come, gi\xe2\x80\x99 us your basket an\xe2\x80\x99 come\r\nbehind and let me put y\xe2\x80\x99 in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo lie on the wool-packs, with a cranny left between the curtains of\r\nthe awning to let in the air, was luxury to Hetty now, and she\r\nhalf-slept away the hours till the driver came to ask her if she wanted\r\nto get down and have \xe2\x80\x9csome victual\xe2\x80\x9d; he himself was going to eat his\r\ndinner at this \xe2\x80\x9cpublic.\xe2\x80\x9d Late at night they reached Leicester, and so\r\nthis second day of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s journey was past. She had spent no money\r\nexcept what she had paid for her food, but she felt that this slow\r\njourneying would be intolerable for her another day, and in the morning\r\nshe found her way to a coach-office to ask about the road to Windsor,\r\nand see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by\r\ncoach again. Yes! The distance was too great\xe2\x80\x94the coaches were too\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94she must give them up; but the elderly clerk at the office,\r\ntouched by her pretty anxious face, wrote down for her the names of the\r\nchief places she must pass through. This was the only comfort she got\r\nin Leicester, for the men stared at her as she went along the street,\r\nand for the first time in her life Hetty wished no one would look at\r\nher. She set out walking again; but this day she was fortunate, for she\r\nwas soon overtaken by a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s cart which carried her to Hinckley,\r\nand by the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilion\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nfrightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and shouting\r\nhilarious remarks at her, twisting himself backwards on his saddle\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire: but still almost a\r\nhundred miles from Windsor, they told her. Oh what a large world it\r\nwas, and what hard work for her to find her way in it! She went by\r\nmistake to Stratford-on-Avon, finding Stratford set down in her list of\r\nplaces, and then she was told she had come a long way out of the right\r\nroad. It was not till the fifth day that she got to Stony Stratford.\r\nThat seems but a slight journey as you look at the map, or remember\r\nyour own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon.\r\nBut how wearily long it was to Hetty! It seemed to her as if this\r\ncountry of flat fields, and hedgerows, and dotted houses, and villages,\r\nand market-towns\xe2\x80\x94all so much alike to her indifferent eyes\xe2\x80\x94must have no\r\nend, and she must go on wandering among them for ever, waiting tired at\r\ntoll-gates for some cart to come, and then finding the cart went only a\r\nlittle way\xe2\x80\x94a very little way\xe2\x80\x94to the miller\xe2\x80\x99s a mile off perhaps; and\r\nshe hated going into the public houses, where she must go to get food\r\nand ask questions, because there were always men lounging there, who\r\nstared at her and joked her rudely. Her body was very weary too with\r\nthese days of new fatigue and anxiety; they had made her look more pale\r\nand worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone through at\r\nhome. When at last she reached Stony Stratford, her impatience and\r\nweariness had become too strong for her economical caution; she\r\ndetermined to take the coach for the rest of the way, though it should\r\ncost her all her remaining money. She would need nothing at Windsor but\r\nto find Arthur. When she had paid the fare for the last coach, she had\r\nonly a shilling; and as she got down at the sign of the Green Man in\r\nWindsor at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the middle of the seventh day, hungry and\r\nfaint, the coachman came up, and begged her to \xe2\x80\x9cremember him.\xe2\x80\x9d She put\r\nher hand in her pocket and took out the shilling, but the tears came\r\nwith the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving away\r\nher last means of getting food, which she really required before she\r\ncould go in search of Arthur. As she held out the shilling, she lifted\r\nup her dark tear-filled eyes to the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s face and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\ngive me back sixpence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gruffly, \xe2\x80\x9cnever mind\xe2\x80\x94put the shilling up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to witness this\r\nscene, and he was a man whose abundant feeding served to keep his good\r\nnature, as well as his person, in high condition. And that lovely\r\ntearful face of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s would have found out the sensitive fibre in\r\nmost men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, young woman, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand have a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 something;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well knocked up, I can see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her into the bar and said to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, missis, take this\r\nyoung woman into the parlour; she\xe2\x80\x99s a little overcome\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntears were falling fast. They were merely hysterical tears: she thought\r\nshe had no reason for weeping now, and was vexed that she was too weak\r\nand tired to help it. She was at Windsor at last, not far from Arthur.\r\n\r\nShe looked with eager, hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that\r\nthe landlady brought her, and for some minutes she forgot everything\r\nelse in the delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering\r\nfrom exhaustion. The landlady sat opposite to her as she ate, and\r\nlooked at her earnestly. No wonder: Hetty had thrown off her bonnet,\r\nand her curls had fallen down. Her face was all the more touching in\r\nits youth and beauty because of its weary look, and the good woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes presently wandered to her figure, which in her hurried dressing on\r\nher journey she had taken no pains to conceal; moreover, the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re not very fit for travelling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, glancing while she\r\nspoke at Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s ringless hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you come far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, roused by this question to exert more self-command,\r\nand feeling the better for the food she had taken. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come a good\r\nlong way, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very tiring. But I\xe2\x80\x99m better now. Could you tell me\r\nwhich way to go to this place?\xe2\x80\x9d Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit\r\nof paper: it was the end of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s letter on which he had written his\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking, the landlord had come in and had begun to look\r\nat her as earnestly as his wife had done. He took up the piece of paper\r\nwhich Hetty handed across the table, and read the address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you want at this house?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. It is in the nature of\r\ninnkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to\r\nask as many questions as possible before giving any information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see a gentleman as is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no gentleman there,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s shut\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94been shut up this fortnight. What gentleman is it you want? Perhaps\r\nI can let you know where to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Captain Donnithorne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty tremulously, her heart beginning\r\nto beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should\r\nfind Arthur at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cWas he\r\nin the Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a fairish skin and\r\nreddish whiskers\xe2\x80\x94and had a servant by the name o\xe2\x80\x99 Pym?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know him\xe2\x80\x94where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine sight o\xe2\x80\x99 miles away from here. The Loamshire Militia\xe2\x80\x99s gone to\r\nIreland; it\xe2\x80\x99s been gone this fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there! She\xe2\x80\x99s fainting,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, hastening to support\r\nHetty, who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a\r\nbeautiful corpse. They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a bad business, I suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, as he brought in\r\nsome water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough what sort of business it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not a common flaunting dratchell, I can see that. She looks like\r\na respectable country girl, and she comes from a good way off, to judge\r\nby her tongue. She talks something like that ostler we had that come\r\nfrom the north. He was as honest a fellow as we ever had about the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re all honest folks in the north.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw a prettier young woman in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s like a pictur in a shop-winder. It goes to one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99eart to look\r\nat her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud have been a good deal better for her if she\xe2\x80\x99d been uglier and\r\nhad more conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, who on any charitable\r\nconstruction must have been supposed to have more \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d than\r\nbeauty. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s coming to again. Fetch a drop more water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII\r\nThe Journey in Despair\r\n\r\n\r\nHetty was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be\r\naddressed to her\xe2\x80\x94too ill even to think with any distinctness of the\r\nevils that were to come. She only felt that all her hope was crushed,\r\nand that instead of having found a refuge she had only reached the\r\nborders of a new wilderness where no goal lay before her. The\r\nsensations of bodily sickness, in a comfortable bed, and with the\r\ntendance of the good-natured landlady, made a sort of respite for her;\r\nsuch a respite as there is in the faint weariness which obliges a man\r\nto throw himself on the sand instead of toiling onward under the\r\nscorching sun.\r\n\r\nBut when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the\r\nkeenness of mental suffering\xe2\x80\x94when she lay the next morning looking at\r\nthe growing light which was like a cruel task-master returning to urge\r\nfrom her a fresh round of hated hopeless labour\xe2\x80\x94she began to think what\r\ncourse she must take, to remember that all her money was gone, to look\r\nat the prospect of further wandering among strangers with the new\r\nclearness shed on it by the experience of her journey to Windsor. But\r\nwhich way could she turn? It was impossible for her to enter into any\r\nservice, even if she could obtain it. There was nothing but immediate\r\nbeggary before her. She thought of a young woman who had been found\r\nagainst the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday, nearly dead with cold\r\nand hunger\xe2\x80\x94a tiny infant in her arms. The woman was rescued and taken\r\nto the parish. \xe2\x80\x9cThe parish!\xe2\x80\x9d You can perhaps hardly understand the\r\neffect of that word on a mind like Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s, brought up among people who\r\nwere somewhat hard in their feelings even towards poverty, who lived\r\namong the fields, and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel\r\ninevitable fate such as they sometimes seem in cities, but held them a\r\nmark of idleness and vice\xe2\x80\x94and it was idleness and vice that brought\r\nburdens on the parish. To Hetty the \xe2\x80\x9cparish\xe2\x80\x9d was next to the prison in\r\nobloquy, and to ask anything of strangers\xe2\x80\x94to beg\xe2\x80\x94lay in the same\r\nfar-off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her life\r\nthought it impossible she could ever come near. But now the remembrance\r\nof that wretched woman whom she had seen herself, on her way from\r\nchurch, being carried into Joshua Rann\xe2\x80\x99s, came back upon her with the\r\nnew terrible sense that there was very little now to divide _her_ from\r\nthe same lot. And the dread of bodily hardship mingled with the dread\r\nof shame; for Hetty had the luxurious nature of a round soft-coated pet\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nHow she yearned to be back in her safe home again, cherished and cared\r\nfor as she had always been! Her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s scolding about trifles would\r\nhave been music to her ears now; she longed for it; she used to hear it\r\nin a time when she had only trifles to hide. Could she be the same\r\nHetty that used to make up the butter in the dairy with the Guelder\r\nroses peeping in at the window\xe2\x80\x94she, a runaway whom her friends would\r\nnot open their doors to again, lying in this strange bed, with the\r\nknowledge that she had no money to pay for what she received, and must\r\noffer those strangers some of the clothes in her basket? It was then\r\nshe thought of her locket and ear-rings, and seeing her pocket lie\r\nnear, she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her.\r\nThere were the locket and ear-rings in the little velvet-lined boxes,\r\nand with them there was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam had\r\nbought her, the words \xe2\x80\x9cRemember me\xe2\x80\x9d making the ornament of the border;\r\na steel purse, with her one shilling in it; and a small red-leather\r\ncase, fastening with a strap. Those beautiful little ear-rings, with\r\ntheir delicate pearls and garnet, that she had tried in her ears with\r\nsuch longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of July! She had no\r\nlonging to put them in her ears now: her head with its dark rings of\r\nhair lay back languidly on the pillow, and the sadness that rested\r\nabout her brow and eyes was something too hard for regretful memory.\r\nYet she put her hands up to her ears: it was because there were some\r\nthin gold rings in them, which were also worth a little money. Yes, she\r\ncould surely get some money for her ornaments: those Arthur had given\r\nher must have cost a great deal of money. The landlord and landlady had\r\nbeen good to her; perhaps they would help her to get the money for\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nBut this money would not keep her long. What should she do when it was\r\ngone? Where should she go? The horrible thought of want and beggary\r\ndrove her once to think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask\r\nthem to forgive her and have pity on her. But she shrank from that idea\r\nagain, as she might have shrunk from scorching metal. She could never\r\nendure that shame before her uncle and aunt, before Mary Burge, and the\r\nservants at the Chase, and the people at Broxton, and everybody who\r\nknew her. They should never know what had happened to her. What _could_\r\nshe do? She would go away from Windsor\xe2\x80\x94travel again as she had done the\r\nlast week, and get among the flat green fields with the high hedges\r\nround them, where nobody could see her or know her; and there, perhaps,\r\nwhen there was nothing else she could do, she should get courage to\r\ndrown herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands. Yes, she would\r\nget away from Windsor as soon as possible: she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like these people\r\nat the inn to know about her, to know that she had come to look for\r\nCaptain Donnithorne. She must think of some reason to tell them why she\r\nhad asked for him.\r\n\r\nWith this thought she began to put the things back into her pocket,\r\nmeaning to get up and dress before the landlady came to her. She had\r\nher hand on the red-leather case, when it occurred to her that there\r\nmight be something in this case which she had forgotten\xe2\x80\x94something worth\r\nselling; for without knowing what she should do with her life, she\r\ncraved the means of living as long as possible; and when we desire\r\neagerly to find something, we are apt to search for it in hopeless\r\nplaces. No, there was nothing but common needles and pins, and dried\r\ntulip-petals between the paper leaves where she had written down her\r\nlittle money-accounts. But on one of these leaves there was a name,\r\nwhich, often as she had seen it before, now flashed on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nlike a newly discovered message. The name was\xe2\x80\x94_Dinah Morris,\r\nSnowfield_. There was a text above it, written, as well as the name, by\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s own hand with a little pencil, one evening that they were\r\nsitting together and Hetty happened to have the red case lying open\r\nbefore her. Hetty did not read the text now: she was only arrested by\r\nthe name. Now, for the first time, she remembered without indifference\r\nthe affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her, and those words of Dinah\r\nin the bed-chamber\xe2\x80\x94that Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble.\r\nSuppose she were to go to Dinah, and ask her to help her? Dinah did not\r\nthink about things as other people did. She was a mystery to Hetty, but\r\nHetty knew she was always kind. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nturning away from her in dark reproof or scorn, Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s voice willingly\r\nspeaking ill of her, or rejoicing in her misery as a punishment. Dinah\r\ndid not seem to belong to that world of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s, whose glance she\r\ndreaded like scorching fire. But even to her Hetty shrank from\r\nbeseeching and confession. She could not prevail on herself to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill go to Dinah\xe2\x80\x9d: she only thought of that as a possible alternative,\r\nif she had not courage for death.\r\n\r\nThe good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon\r\nafter herself, neatly dressed, and looking resolutely self-possessed.\r\nHetty told her she was quite well this morning. She had only been very\r\ntired and overcome with her journey, for she had come a long way to ask\r\nabout her brother, who had run away, and they thought he was gone for a\r\nsoldier, and Captain Donnithorne might know, for he had been very kind\r\nto her brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked\r\ndoubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there was a resolute air of\r\nself-reliance about her this morning, so different from the helpless\r\nprostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to make a\r\nremark that might seem like prying into other people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. She\r\nonly invited her to sit down to breakfast with them, and in the course\r\nof it Hetty brought out her ear-rings and locket, and asked the\r\nlandlord if he could help her to get money for them. Her journey, she\r\nsaid, had cost her much more than she expected, and now she had no\r\nmoney to get back to her friends, which she wanted to do at once.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments, for she\r\nhad examined the contents of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s pocket yesterday, and she and her\r\nhusband had discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful\r\nthings, with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been\r\nmiserably deluded by the fine young officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, when Hetty had spread the precious trifles\r\nbefore him, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might take \xe2\x80\x99em to the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s shop, for there\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nnot far off; but Lord bless you, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you a quarter o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhat the things are worth. And you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to part with \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, looking at her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cso as I can get money to go\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they might think the things were stolen, as you wanted to sell\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it isn\xe2\x80\x99t usual for a young woman like you to\r\nhave fine jew\xe2\x80\x99llery like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face with anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to respectable\r\nfolks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that you aren\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\ncall to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d looking indignantly at her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThe things were\r\ngev to her: that\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean as I thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband, apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI said it was what the jeweller might think, and so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\noffering much money for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose you were to advance some money on the\r\nthings yourself, and then if she liked to redeem \xe2\x80\x99em when she got home,\r\nshe could. But if we heard nothing from her after two months, we might\r\ndo as we liked with \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI will not say that in this accommodating proposition the landlady had\r\nno regard whatever to the possible reward of her good nature in the\r\nultimate possession of the locket and ear-rings: indeed, the effect\r\nthey would have in that case on the mind of the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s wife had\r\npresented itself with remarkable vividness to her rapid imagination.\r\nThe landlord took up the ornaments and pushed out his lips in a\r\nmeditative manner. He wished Hetty well, doubtless; but pray, how many\r\nof your well-wishers would decline to make a little gain out of you?\r\nYour landlady is sincerely affected at parting with you, respects you\r\nhighly, and will really rejoice if any one else is generous to you; but\r\nat the same time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a\r\npercentage as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much money do you want to get home with, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwell-wisher, at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree guineas,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hetty, fixing on the sum she set out with,\r\nfor want of any other standard, and afraid of asking too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no objections to advance you three guineas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlord; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery\r\nagain, you can, you know. The Green Man isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very glad if you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty,\r\nrelieved at the thought that she would not have to go to the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand be stared at and questioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you want the things again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll write before long,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlady, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause when two months are up, we shall make up our minds\r\nas you don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty indifferently.\r\n\r\nThe husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement. The\r\nhusband thought, if the ornaments were not redeemed, he could make a\r\ngood thing of it by taking them to London and selling them. The wife\r\nthought she would coax the good man into letting her keep them. And\r\nthey were accommodating Hetty, poor thing\xe2\x80\x94a pretty, respectable-looking\r\nyoung woman, apparently in a sad case. They declined to take anything\r\nfor her food and bed: she was quite welcome. And at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nHetty said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d to them with the same quiet, resolute air she had\r\nworn all the morning, mounting the coach that was to take her twenty\r\nmiles back along the way she had come.\r\n\r\nThere is a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the last\r\nhope has departed. Despair no more leans on others than perfect\r\ncontentment, and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the\r\nsense of dependence.\r\n\r\nHetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make\r\nlife hateful to her; and no one, she said to herself, should ever know\r\nher misery and humiliation. No; she would not confess even to Dinah.\r\nShe would wander out of sight, and drown herself where her body would\r\nnever be found, and no one should know what had become of her.\r\n\r\nWhen she got off this coach, she began to walk again, and take cheap\r\nrides in carts, and get cheap meals, going on and on without distinct\r\npurpose, yet strangely, by some fascination, taking the way she had\r\ncome, though she was determined not to go back to her own country.\r\nPerhaps it was because she had fixed her mind on the grassy\r\nWarwickshire fields, with the bushy tree-studded hedgerows that made a\r\nhiding-place even in this leafless season. She went more slowly than\r\nshe came, often getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under the\r\nhedgerows, looking before her with blank, beautiful eyes; fancying\r\nherself at the edge of a hidden pool, low down, like that in the\r\nScantlands; wondering if it were very painful to be drowned, and if\r\nthere would be anything worse after death than what she dreaded in\r\nlife. Religious doctrines had taken no hold on Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She was\r\none of those numerous people who have had godfathers and godmothers,\r\nlearned their catechism, been confirmed, and gone to church every\r\nSunday, and yet, for any practical result of strength in life, or trust\r\nin death, have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian\r\nfeeling. You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched\r\ndays, if you imagined that they were influenced either by religious\r\nfears or religious hopes.\r\n\r\nShe chose to go to Stratford-on-Avon again, where she had gone before\r\nby mistake, for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way\r\ntowards it\xe2\x80\x94fields among which she thought she might find just the sort\r\nof pool she had in her mind. Yet she took care of her money still; she\r\ncarried her basket; death seemed still a long way off, and life was so\r\nstrong in her. She craved food and rest\xe2\x80\x94she hastened towards them at\r\nthe very moment she was picturing to herself the bank from which she\r\nwould leap towards death. It was already five days since she had left\r\nWindsor, for she had wandered about, always avoiding speech or\r\nquestioning looks, and recovering her air of proud self-dependence\r\nwhenever she was under observation, choosing her decent lodging at\r\nnight, and dressing herself neatly in the morning, and setting off on\r\nher way steadily, or remaining under shelter if it rained, as if she\r\nhad a happy life to cherish.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even in her most self-conscious moments, the face was sadly\r\ndifferent from that which had smiled at itself in the old specked\r\nglass, or smiled at others when they glanced at it admiringly. A hard\r\nand even fierce look had come in the eyes, though their lashes were as\r\nlong as ever, and they had all their dark brightness. And the cheek was\r\nnever dimpled with smiles now. It was the same rounded, pouting,\r\nchildish prettiness, but with all love and belief in love departed from\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94the sadder for its beauty, like that wondrous Medusa-face, with the\r\npassionate, passionless lips.\r\n\r\nAt last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of, on a long\r\nnarrow pathway leading towards a wood. If there should be a pool in\r\nthat wood! It would be better hidden than one in the fields. No, it was\r\nnot a wood, only a wild brake, where there had once been gravel-pits,\r\nleaving mounds and hollows studded with brushwood and small trees. She\r\nroamed up and down, thinking there was perhaps a pool in every hollow\r\nbefore she came to it, till her limbs were weary, and she sat down to\r\nrest. The afternoon was far advanced, and the leaden sky was darkening,\r\nas if the sun were setting behind it. After a little while Hetty\r\nstarted up again, feeling that darkness would soon come on; and she\r\nmust put off finding the pool till to-morrow, and make her way to some\r\nshelter for the night. She had quite lost her way in the fields, and\r\nmight as well go in one direction as another, for aught she knew. She\r\nwalked through field after field, and no village, no house was in\r\nsight; but _there_, at the corner of this pasture, there was a break in\r\nthe hedges; the land seemed to dip down a little, and two trees leaned\r\ntowards each other across the opening. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s heart gave a great beat\r\nas she thought there must be a pool there. She walked towards it\r\nheavily over the tufted grass, with pale lips and a sense of trembling.\r\nIt was as if the thing were come in spite of herself, instead of being\r\nthe object of her search.\r\n\r\nThere it was, black under the darkening sky: no motion, no sound near.\r\nShe set down her basket, and then sank down herself on the grass,\r\ntrembling. The pool had its wintry depth now: by the time it got\r\nshallow, as she remembered the pools did at Hayslope, in the summer, no\r\none could find out that it was her body. But then there was her\r\nbasket\xe2\x80\x94she must hide that too. She must throw it into the water\xe2\x80\x94make it\r\nheavy with stones first, and then throw it in. She got up to look about\r\nfor stones, and soon brought five or six, which she laid down beside\r\nher basket, and then sat down again. There was no need to hurry\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas all the night to drown herself in. She sat leaning her elbow on the\r\nbasket. She was weary, hungry. There were some buns in her\r\nbasket\xe2\x80\x94three, which she had supplied herself with at the place where\r\nshe ate her dinner. She took them out now and ate them eagerly, and\r\nthen sat still again, looking at the pool. The soothed sensation that\r\ncame over her from the satisfaction of her hunger, and this fixed\r\ndreamy attitude, brought on drowsiness, and presently her head sank\r\ndown on her knees. She was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke it was deep night, and she felt chill. She was\r\nfrightened at this darkness\xe2\x80\x94frightened at the long night before her. If\r\nshe _could_ but throw herself into the water! No, not yet. She began to\r\nwalk about that she might get warm again, as if she would have more\r\nresolution then. Oh how long the time was in that darkness! The bright\r\nhearth and the warmth and the voices of home, the secure uprising and\r\nlying down, the familiar fields, the familiar people, the Sundays and\r\nholidays with their simple joys of dress and feasting\xe2\x80\x94all the sweets of\r\nher young life rushed before her now, and she seemed to be stretching\r\nher arms towards them across a great gulf. She set her teeth when she\r\nthought of Arthur. She cursed him, without knowing what her cursing\r\nwould do. She wished he too might know desolation, and cold, and a life\r\nof shame that he dared not end by death.\r\n\r\nThe horror of this cold, and darkness, and solitude\xe2\x80\x94out of all human\r\nreach\xe2\x80\x94became greater every long minute. It was almost as if she were\r\ndead already, and knew that she was dead, and longed to get back to\r\nlife again. But no: she was alive still; she had not taken the dreadful\r\nleap. She felt a strange contradictory wretchedness and exultation:\r\nwretchedness, that she did not dare to face death; exultation, that she\r\nwas still in life\xe2\x80\x94that she might yet know light and warmth again. She\r\nwalked backwards and forwards to warm herself, beginning to discern\r\nsomething of the objects around her, as her eyes became accustomed to\r\nthe night\xe2\x80\x94the darker line of the hedge, the rapid motion of some living\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a field-mouse\xe2\x80\x94rushing across the grass. She no longer\r\nfelt as if the darkness hedged her in. She thought she could walk back\r\nacross the field, and get over the stile; and then, in the very next\r\nfield, she thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a\r\nsheepfold. If she could get into that hovel, she would be warmer. She\r\ncould pass the night there, for that was what Alick did at Hayslope in\r\nlambing-time. The thought of this hovel brought the energy of a new\r\nhope. She took up her basket and walked across the field, but it was\r\nsome time before she got in the right direction for the stile. The\r\nexercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a stimulus to\r\nher, however, and lightened the horror of the darkness and solitude.\r\nThere were sheep in the next field, and she startled a group as she set\r\ndown her basket and got over the stile; and the sound of their movement\r\ncomforted her, for it assured her that her impression was right\xe2\x80\x94this\r\n_was_ the field where she had seen the hovel, for it was the field\r\nwhere the sheep were. Right on along the path, and she would get to it.\r\nShe reached the opposite gate, and felt her way along its rails and the\r\nrails of the sheep-fold, till her hand encountered the pricking of the\r\ngorsy wall. Delicious sensation! She had found the shelter. She groped\r\nher way, touching the prickly gorse, to the door, and pushed it open.\r\nIt was an ill-smelling close place, but warm, and there was straw on\r\nthe ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with a sense of escape. Tears\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94she had never shed tears before since she left Windsor\xe2\x80\x94tears and\r\nsobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life, that she was\r\nstill on the familiar earth, with the sheep near her. The very\r\nconsciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her: she turned up her\r\nsleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life. Soon\r\nwarmth and weariness lulled her in the midst of her sobs, and she fell\r\ncontinually into dozing, fancying herself at the brink of the pool\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94fancying that she had jumped into the water, and then awaking\r\nwith a start, and wondering where she was. But at last deep dreamless\r\nsleep came; her head, guarded by her bonnet, found a pillow against the\r\ngorsy wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two equal\r\nterrors, found the one relief that was possible to it\xe2\x80\x94the relief of\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nAlas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It seemed to\r\nHetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dream\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nshe was in the hovel, and her aunt was standing over her with a candle\r\nin her hand. She trembled under her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glance, and opened her eyes.\r\nThere was no candle, but there was light in the hovel\xe2\x80\x94the light of\r\nearly morning through the open door. And there was a face looking down\r\non her; but it was an unknown face, belonging to an elderly man in a\r\nsmock-frock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you do here, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d the man said roughly.\r\n\r\nHetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had\r\ndone in her momentary dream under her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glance. She felt that she\r\nwas like a beggar already\xe2\x80\x94found sleeping in that place. But in spite of\r\nher trembling, she was so eager to account to the man for her presence\r\nhere, that she found words at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost my way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m travelling\xe2\x80\x94north\xe2\x80\x99ard, and I got away\r\nfrom the road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark. Will you\r\ntell me the way to the nearest village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up as she was speaking, and put her hands to her bonnet to\r\nadjust it, and then laid hold of her basket.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze, without giving her any\r\nanswer, for some seconds. Then he turned away and walked towards the\r\ndoor of the hovel, but it was not till he got there that he stood\r\nstill, and, turning his shoulder half-round towards her, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAw, I\r\ncan show you the way to Norton, if you like. But what do you do gettin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 the highroad?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a tone of gruff reproof. \xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x99ull be\r\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 into mischief, if you dooant mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep in the road, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as show me how to get to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dooant you keep where there\xe2\x80\x99s a finger-poasses an\xe2\x80\x99 folks to ax the\r\nway on?\xe2\x80\x9d the man said, still more gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think you was a\r\nwild woman, an\xe2\x80\x99 look at yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this last\r\nsuggestion that she looked like a wild woman. As she followed him out\r\nof the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her\r\nthe way, and then he would not suppose she was wild. As he stopped to\r\npoint out the road to her, she put her hand in her pocket to get the\r\nsix-pence ready, and when he was turning away, without saying\r\ngood-morning, she held it out to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you; will you\r\nplease to take something for your trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked slowly at the sixpence, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want none o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nmoney. You\xe2\x80\x99d better take care on\xe2\x80\x99t, else you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it stool from yer,\r\nif you go trapesin\xe2\x80\x99 about the fields like a mad woman a-thatway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man left her without further speech, and Hetty held on her way.\r\nAnother day had risen, and she must wander on. It was no use to think\r\nof drowning herself\xe2\x80\x94she could not do it, at least while she had money\r\nleft to buy food and strength to journey on. But the incident on her\r\nwaking this morning heightened her dread of that time when her money\r\nwould be all gone; she would have to sell her basket and clothes then,\r\nand she would really look like a beggar or a wild woman, as the man had\r\nsaid. The passionate joy in life she had felt in the night, after\r\nescaping from the brink of the black cold death in the pool, was gone\r\nnow. Life now, by the morning light, with the impression of that man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhard wondering look at her, was as full of dread as death\xe2\x80\x94it was worse;\r\nit was a dread to which she felt chained, from which she shrank and\r\nshrank as she did from the black pool, and yet could find no refuge\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nShe took out her money from her purse, and looked at it. She had still\r\ntwo-and-twenty shillings; it would serve her for many days more, or it\r\nwould help her to get on faster to Stonyshire, within reach of Dinah.\r\nThe thought of Dinah urged itself more strongly now, since the\r\nexperience of the night had driven her shuddering imagination away from\r\nthe pool. If it had been only going to Dinah\xe2\x80\x94if nobody besides Dinah\r\nwould ever know\xe2\x80\x94Hetty could have made up her mind to go to her. The\r\nsoft voice, the pitying eyes, would have drawn her. But afterwards the\r\nother people must know, and she could no more rush on that shame than\r\nshe could rush on death.\r\n\r\nShe must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of despair to\r\ngive her courage. Perhaps death would come to her, for she was getting\r\nless and less able to bear the day\xe2\x80\x99s weariness. And yet\xe2\x80\x94such is the\r\nstrange action of our souls, drawing us by a lurking desire towards the\r\nvery ends we dread\xe2\x80\x94Hetty, when she set out again from Norton, asked the\r\nstraightest road northwards towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nPoor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the hard,\r\nunloving, despairing soul looking out of it\xe2\x80\x94with the narrow heart and\r\nnarrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but her own, and\r\ntasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness! My heart bleeds\r\nfor her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet, or seated in a\r\ncart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her, never\r\nthinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger comes and makes her\r\ndesire that a village may be near.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart from\r\nall love, caring for human beings only through her pride, clinging to\r\nlife only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?\r\n\r\nGod preserve you and me from being the beginners of such misery!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII\r\nThe Quest\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first ten days after Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s departure passed as quietly as any\r\nother days with the family at the Hall Farm, and with Adam at his daily\r\nwork. They had expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least,\r\nperhaps a little longer if Dinah came back with her, because there\r\nmight then be something to detain them at Snowfield. But when a\r\nfortnight had passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty\r\ndid not return; she must surely have found it pleasanter to be with\r\nDinah than any one could have supposed. Adam, for his part, was getting\r\nvery impatient to see her, and he resolved that, if she did not appear\r\nthe next day (Saturday), he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch\r\nher. There was no coach on a Sunday, but by setting out before it was\r\nlight, and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way, he would arrive\r\npretty early at Snowfield, and bring back Hetty the next day\xe2\x80\x94Dinah too,\r\nif she were coming. It was quite time Hetty came home, and he would\r\nafford to lose his Monday for the sake of bringing her.\r\n\r\nHis project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on\r\nSaturday evening. Mrs. Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back\r\nwithout Hetty, for she had been quite too long away, considering the\r\nthings she had to get ready by the middle of March, and a week was\r\nsurely enough for any one to go out for their health. As for Dinah,\r\nMrs. Poyser had small hope of their bringing her, unless they could\r\nmake her believe the folks at Hayslope were twice as miserable as the\r\nfolks at Snowfield. \xe2\x80\x9cThough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, by way of conclusion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou might tell her she\xe2\x80\x99s got but one aunt left, and _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ wasted\r\npretty nigh to a shadder; and we shall p\xe2\x80\x99rhaps all be gone twenty mile\r\nfarther off her next Michaelmas, and shall die o\xe2\x80\x99 broken hearts among\r\nstrange folks, and leave the children fatherless and motherless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who certainly had the air of a man\r\nperfectly heart-whole, \xe2\x80\x9cit isna so bad as that. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t looking rarely\r\nnow, and getting flesh every day. But I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad for Dinah t\xe2\x80\x99 come,\r\nfor she\xe2\x80\x99d help thee wi\xe2\x80\x99 the little uns: they took t\xe2\x80\x99 her wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo at daybreak, on Sunday, Adam set off. Seth went with him the first\r\nmile or two, for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that\r\nDinah might come again made him restless, and the walk with Adam in the\r\ncold morning air, both in their best clothes, helped to give him a\r\nsense of Sunday calm. It was the last morning in February, with a low\r\ngrey sky, and a slight hoar-frost on the green border of the road and\r\non the black hedges. They heard the gurgling of the full brooklet\r\nhurrying down the hill, and the faint twittering of the early birds.\r\nFor they walked in silence, though with a pleased sense of\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, laying his hand on Seth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and\r\nlooking at him affectionately as they were about to part. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish thee\r\nwast going all the way wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, and as happy as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m content, Addy, I\xe2\x80\x99m content,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be an old\r\nbachelor, belike, and make a fuss wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely homeward,\r\nmentally repeating one of his favourite hymns\xe2\x80\x94he was very fond of\r\nhymns:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark and cheerless is the morn\r\n    Unaccompanied by thee:\r\nJoyless is the day\xe2\x80\x99s return\r\n    Till thy mercy\xe2\x80\x99s beams I see:\r\nTill thou inward light impart,\r\nGlad my eyes and warm my heart.\r\n\r\nVisit, then, this soul of mine,\r\n    Pierce the gloom of sin and grief\xe2\x80\x94\r\nFill me, Radiancy Divine,\r\n    Scatter all my unbelief.\r\nMore and more thyself display,\r\nShining to the perfect day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam walked much faster, and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at\r\nsunrise that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall\r\nbroad-chested man, striding along with a carriage as upright and firm\r\nas any soldier\xe2\x80\x99s, glancing with keen glad eyes at the dark-blue hills\r\nas they began to show themselves on his way. Seldom in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s life had\r\nhis face been so free from any cloud of anxiety as it was this morning;\r\nand this freedom from care, as is usual with constructive practical\r\nminds like his, made him all the more observant of the objects round\r\nhim and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them towards his\r\nown favourite plans and ingenious contrivances. His happy love\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nknowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty,\r\nwho was so soon to be his\xe2\x80\x94was to his thoughts what the sweet morning\r\nair was to his sensations: it gave him a consciousness of well-being\r\nthat made activity delightful. Every now and then there was a rush of\r\nmore intense feeling towards her, which chased away other images than\r\nHetty; and along with that would come a wondering thankfulness that all\r\nthis happiness was given to him\xe2\x80\x94that this life of ours had such\r\nsweetness in it. For Adam had a devout mind, though he was perhaps\r\nrather impatient of devout words, and his tenderness lay very close to\r\nhis reverence, so that the one could hardly be stirred without the\r\nother. But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this\r\nway, busy thought would come back with the greater vigour; and this\r\nmorning it was intent on schemes by which the roads might be improved\r\nthat were so imperfect all through the country, and on picturing all\r\nthe benefits that might come from the exertions of a single country\r\ngentleman, if he would set himself to getting the roads made good in\r\nhis own district.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a very short walk, the ten miles to Oakbourne, that pretty\r\ntown within sight of the blue hills, where he break-fasted. After this,\r\nthe country grew barer and barer: no more rolling woods, no more\r\nwide-branching trees near frequent homesteads, no more bushy hedgerows,\r\nbut greystone walls intersecting the meagre pastures, and dismal\r\nwide-scattered greystone houses on broken lands where mines had been\r\nand were no longer. \xe2\x80\x9cA hungry land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\ngo south\xe2\x80\x99ard, where they say it\xe2\x80\x99s as flat as a table, than come to live\r\nhere; though if Dinah likes to live in a country where she can be the\r\nmost comfort to folks, she\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 the right to live o\xe2\x80\x99 this side; for she\r\nmust look as if she\xe2\x80\x99d come straight from heaven, like th\xe2\x80\x99 angels in the\r\ndesert, to strengthen them as ha\xe2\x80\x99 got nothing t\xe2\x80\x99 eat.\xe2\x80\x9d And when at last\r\nhe came in sight of Snowfield, he thought it looked like a town that\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cfellow to the country,\xe2\x80\x9d though the stream through the valley where\r\nthe great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the lower fields. The\r\ntown lay, grim, stony, and unsheltered, up the side of a steep hill,\r\nand Adam did not go forward to it at present, for Seth had told him\r\nwhere to find Dinah. It was at a thatched cottage outside the town, a\r\nlittle way from the mill\xe2\x80\x94an old cottage, standing sideways towards the\r\nroad, with a little bit of potato-ground before it. Here Dinah lodged\r\nwith an elderly couple; and if she and Hetty happened to be out, Adam\r\ncould learn where they were gone, or when they would be at home again.\r\nDinah might be out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she would have\r\nleft Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he\r\nrecognized the cottage by the roadside before him, there shone out in\r\nhis face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a\r\nnear joy.\r\n\r\nHe hurried his step along the narrow causeway, and rapped at the door.\r\nIt was opened by a very clean old woman, with a slow palsied shake of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Dinah Morris at home?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?... no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, looking up at this tall stranger with\r\na wonder that made her slower of speech than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to\r\ncome in?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, retiring from the door, as if recollecting\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ye\xe2\x80\x99re brother to the young man as come afore, arena ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, entering. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was Seth Bede. I\xe2\x80\x99m his brother Adam.\r\nHe told me to give his respects to you and your good master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, the same t\xe2\x80\x99 him. He was a gracious young man. An\xe2\x80\x99 ye feature him,\r\non\xe2\x80\x99y ye\xe2\x80\x99re darker. Sit ye down i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 arm-chair. My man isna come home\r\nfrom meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam sat down patiently, not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with\r\nquestions, but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in\r\none corner, for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his\r\nvoice and would come down them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re come to see Dinah Morris?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, standing\r\nopposite to him. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you didn\xe2\x80\x99 know she was away from home, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought it likely she might be away, seeing as\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday. But the other young woman\xe2\x80\x94is she at home, or gone along\r\nwith Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone along wi\xe2\x80\x99 her?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Leeds, a big town\r\nye may ha\xe2\x80\x99 heared on, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a many o\xe2\x80\x99 the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s people. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen gone sin\xe2\x80\x99 Friday was a fortnight: they sent her the money for her\r\njourney. You may see her room here,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, opening a door and\r\nnot noticing the effect of her words on Adam. He rose and followed her,\r\nand darted an eager glance into the little room with its narrow bed,\r\nthe portrait of Wesley on the wall, and the few books lying on the\r\nlarge Bible. He had had an irrational hope that Hetty might be there.\r\nHe could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the room was\r\nempty; an undefined fear had seized him\xe2\x80\x94something had happened to Hetty\r\non the journey. Still the old woman was so slow of speech and\r\napprehension, that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity ye didna know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave ye come from your own\r\ncountry o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Hetty\xe2\x80\x94Hetty Sorrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, abruptly; \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is _she?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nobody by that name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nanybody ye\xe2\x80\x99ve heared on at Snowfield?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid there come no young woman here\xe2\x80\x94very young and pretty\xe2\x80\x94Friday was a\r\nfortnight, to see Dinah Morris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay; I\xe2\x80\x99n seen no young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink; are you quite sure? A girl, eighteen years old, with dark eyes\r\nand dark curly hair, and a red cloak on, and a basket on her arm? You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget her if you saw her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay; Friday was a fortnight\xe2\x80\x94it was the day as Dinah went away\xe2\x80\x94there\r\ncome nobody. There\xe2\x80\x99s ne\xe2\x80\x99er been nobody asking for her till you come,\r\nfor the folks about know as she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Eh dear, eh dear, is there\r\nsummat the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face. But he\r\nwas not stunned or confounded: he was thinking eagerly where he could\r\ninquire about Hetty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a young woman started from our country to see Dinah, Friday was a\r\nfortnight. I came to fetch her back. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid something has happened\r\nto her. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened out of the cottage, and the old woman followed him to the\r\ngate, watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards\r\nthe town. He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne\r\ncoach stopped.\r\n\r\nNo! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there. Had any accident\r\nhappened to the coach a fortnight ago? No. And there was no coach to\r\ntake him back to Oakbourne that day. Well, he would walk: he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstay here, in wretched inaction. But the innkeeper, seeing that Adam\r\nwas in great anxiety, and entering into this new incident with the\r\neagerness of a man who passes a great deal of time with his hands in\r\nhis pockets looking into an obstinately monotonous street, offered to\r\ntake him back to Oakbourne in his own \xe2\x80\x9ctaxed cart\xe2\x80\x9d this very evening.\r\nIt was not five o\xe2\x80\x99clock; there was plenty of time for Adam to take a\r\nmeal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The innkeeper\r\ndeclared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne, and might as well go\r\nto-night; he should have all Monday before him then. Adam, after making\r\nan ineffectual attempt to eat, put the food in his pocket, and,\r\ndrinking a draught of ale, declared himself ready to set off. As they\r\napproached the cottage, it occurred to him that he would do well to\r\nlearn from the old woman where Dinah was to be found in Leeds: if there\r\nwas trouble at the Hall Farm\xe2\x80\x94he only half-admitted the foreboding that\r\nthere would be\xe2\x80\x94the Poysers might like to send for Dinah. But Dinah had\r\nnot left any address, and the old woman, whose memory for names was\r\ninfirm, could not recall the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cblessed woman\xe2\x80\x9d who was\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s chief friend in the Society at Leeds.\r\n\r\nDuring that long, long journey in the taxed cart, there was time for\r\nall the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope. In the\r\nvery first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield,\r\nthe thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a sharp pang, but he\r\ntried for some time to ward off its return by busying himself with\r\nmodes of accounting for the alarming fact, quite apart from that\r\nintolerable thought. Some accident had happened. Hetty had, by some\r\nstrange chance, got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne: she had been\r\ntaken ill, and did not want to frighten them by letting them know. But\r\nthis frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a\r\nrush of distinct agonizing fears. Hetty had been deceiving herself in\r\nthinking that she could love and marry him: she had been loving Arthur\r\nall the while; and now, in her desperation at the nearness of their\r\nmarriage, she had run away. And she was gone to _him_. The old\r\nindignation and jealousy rose again, and prompted the suspicion that\r\nArthur had been dealing falsely\xe2\x80\x94had written to Hetty\xe2\x80\x94had tempted her to\r\ncome to him\xe2\x80\x94being unwilling, after all, that she should belong to\r\nanother man besides himself. Perhaps the whole thing had been contrived\r\nby him, and he had given her directions how to follow him to\r\nIreland\xe2\x80\x94for Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks\r\nago, having recently learnt it at the Chase. Every sad look of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nsince she had been engaged to Adam, returned upon him now with all the\r\nexaggeration of painful retrospect. He had been foolishly sanguine and\r\nconfident. The poor thing hadn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps known her own mind for a long\r\nwhile; had thought that she could forget Arthur; had been momentarily\r\ndrawn towards the man who offered her a protecting, faithful love. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to blame her: she never meant to cause him this dreadful\r\npain. The blame lay with that man who had selfishly played with her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94had perhaps even deliberately lured her away.\r\n\r\nAt Oakbourne, the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman\r\nas Adam described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a\r\nfortnight ago\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a\r\nhurry\xe2\x80\x94was sure she had not gone on by the Buxton coach that went\r\nthrough Snowfield, but had lost sight of her while he went away with\r\nthe horses and had never set eyes on her again. Adam then went straight\r\nto the house from which the Stoniton coach started: Stoniton was the\r\nmost obvious place for Hetty to go to first, whatever might be her\r\ndestination, for she would hardly venture on any but the chief\r\ncoach-roads. She had been noticed here too, and was remembered to have\r\nsat on the box by the coachman; but the coachman could not be seen, for\r\nanother man had been driving on that road in his stead the last three\r\nor four days. He could probably be seen at Stoniton, through inquiry at\r\nthe inn where the coach put up. So the anxious heart-stricken Adam must\r\nof necessity wait and try to rest till morning\xe2\x80\x94nay, till eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the coach started.\r\n\r\nAt Stoniton another delay occurred, for the old coachman who had driven\r\nHetty would not be in the town again till night. When he did come he\r\nremembered Hetty well, and remembered his own joke addressed to her,\r\nquoting it many times to Adam, and observing with equal frequency that\r\nhe thought there was something more than common, because Hetty had not\r\nlaughed when he joked her. But he declared, as the people had done at\r\nthe inn, that he had lost sight of Hetty directly she got down. Part of\r\nthe next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the town\r\nfrom which a coach started\xe2\x80\x94(all in vain, for you know Hetty did not\r\nstart from Stoniton by coach, but on foot in the grey morning)\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nin walking out to the first toll-gates on the different lines of road,\r\nin the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there. No, she\r\nwas not to be traced any farther; and the next hard task for Adam was\r\nto go home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm. As to what\r\nhe should do beyond that, he had come to two distinct resolutions\r\namidst the tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him\r\nwhile he went to and fro. He would not mention what he knew of Arthur\r\nDonnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear necessity for\r\nit: it was still possible Hetty might come back, and the disclosure\r\nmight be an injury or an offence to her. And as soon as he had been\r\nhome and done what was necessary there to prepare for his further\r\nabsence, he would start off to Ireland: if he found no trace of Hetty\r\non the road, he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make\r\nhimself certain how far he was acquainted with her movements. Several\r\ntimes the thought occurred to him that he would consult Mr. Irwine, but\r\nthat would be useless unless he told him all, and so betrayed the\r\nsecret about Arthur. It seems strange that Adam, in the incessant\r\noccupation of his mind about Hetty, should never have alighted on the\r\nprobability that she had gone to Windsor, ignorant that Arthur was no\r\nlonger there. Perhaps the reason was that he could not conceive Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthrowing herself on Arthur uncalled; he imagined no cause that could\r\nhave driven her to such a step, after that letter written in August.\r\nThere were but two alternatives in his mind: either Arthur had written\r\nto her again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her\r\napproaching marriage with himself because she found, after all, she\r\ncould not love him well enough, and yet was afraid of her friends\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanger if she retracted.\r\n\r\nWith this last determination on his mind, of going straight to Arthur,\r\nthe thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to\r\nbe almost useless, was torturing to Adam; and yet, since he would not\r\ntell the Poysers his conviction as to where Hetty was gone, or his\r\nintention to follow her thither, he must be able to say to them that he\r\nhad traced her as far as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Tuesday night when Adam reached\r\nTreddleston; and, unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth, and also to\r\nencounter their questions at that hour, he threw himself without\r\nundressing on a bed at the \xe2\x80\x9cWaggon Overthrown,\xe2\x80\x9d and slept hard from\r\npure weariness. Not more than four hours, however, for before five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he set out on his way home in the faint morning twilight. He\r\nalways kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket, so that he could\r\nlet himself in; and he wished to enter without awaking his mother, for\r\nhe was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by seeing\r\nSeth first, and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary. He\r\nwalked gently along the yard, and turned the key gently in the door;\r\nbut, as he expected, Gyp, who lay in the workshop, gave a sharp bark.\r\nIt subsided when he saw Adam, holding up his finger at him to impose\r\nsilence, and in his dumb, tailless joy he must content himself with\r\nrubbing his body against his master\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\nAdam was too heart-sick to take notice of Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s fondling. He threw\r\nhimself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work\r\naround him, wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them\r\nagain, while Gyp, dimly aware that there was something wrong with his\r\nmaster, laid his rough grey head on Adam\xe2\x80\x99s knee and wrinkled his brows\r\nto look up at him. Hitherto, since Sunday afternoon, Adam had been\r\nconstantly among strange people and in strange places, having no\r\nassociations with the details of his daily life, and now that by the\r\nlight of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded\r\nby the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm, the\r\nreality\xe2\x80\x94the hard, inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him\r\nwith a new weight. Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers,\r\nwhich he had been making in spare moments for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s use, when his\r\nhome should be hers.\r\n\r\nSeth had not heard Adam\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, but he had been roused by Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbark, and Adam heard him moving about in the room above, dressing\r\nhimself. Seth\xe2\x80\x99s first thoughts were about his brother: he would come\r\nhome to-day, surely, for the business would be wanting him sadly by\r\nto-morrow, but it was pleasant to think he had had a longer holiday\r\nthan he had expected. And would Dinah come too? Seth felt that that was\r\nthe greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself, though he\r\nhad no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him;\r\nbut he had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nand brother than any other woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband. If he could but be always\r\nnear her, instead of living so far off!\r\n\r\nHe came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen\r\ninto the workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he stood still in the\r\ndoorway, smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated\r\nlistlessly on the bench, pale, unwashed, with sunken blank eyes, almost\r\nlike a drunkard in the morning. But Seth felt in an instant what the\r\nmarks meant\xe2\x80\x94not drunkenness, but some great calamity. Adam looked up at\r\nhim without speaking, and Seth moved forward towards the bench, himself\r\ntrembling so that speech did not come readily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod have mercy on us, Addy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice, sitting down on\r\nthe bench beside Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was unable to speak. The strong man, accustomed to suppress the\r\nsigns of sorrow, had felt his heart swell like a child\xe2\x80\x99s at this first\r\napproach of sympathy. He fell on Seth\xe2\x80\x99s neck and sobbed.\r\n\r\nSeth was prepared for the worst now, for, even in his recollections of\r\ntheir boyhood, Adam had never sobbed before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it death, Adam? Is she dead?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a low tone, when Adam\r\nraised his head and was recovering himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lad; but she\xe2\x80\x99s gone\xe2\x80\x94gone away from us. She\xe2\x80\x99s never been to\r\nSnowfield. Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday was a\r\nfortnight, the very day Hetty set out. I can\xe2\x80\x99t find out where she went\r\nafter she got to Stoniton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth was silent from utter astonishment: he knew nothing that could\r\nsuggest to him a reason for Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s going away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast any notion what she\xe2\x80\x99s done it for?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 loved me. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like our marriage when it came\r\nnigh\xe2\x80\x94that must be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. He had determined to mention no\r\nfurther reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear Mother stirring,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cMust we tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, rising from the bench and pushing the hair\r\nfrom his face, as if he wanted to rouse himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have her told\r\nyet; and I must set out on another journey directly, after I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to\r\nthe village and th\xe2\x80\x99 Hall Farm. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell thee where I\xe2\x80\x99m going, and\r\nthee must say to her I\xe2\x80\x99m gone on business as nobody is to know anything\r\nabout. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and wash myself now.\xe2\x80\x9d Adam moved towards the door of the\r\nworkshop, but after a step or two he turned round, and, meeting Seth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes with a calm sad glance, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must take all the money out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe tin box, lad; but if anything happens to me, all the rest \xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nthine, to take care o\xe2\x80\x99 Mother with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth was pale and trembling: he felt there was some terrible secret\r\nunder all this. \xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly\xe2\x80\x94he never called Adam\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother\xe2\x80\x9d except in solemn moments\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything\r\nas you can\xe2\x80\x99t ask God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99m for doing nought but\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x99s duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother, she would\r\nonly distress him by words, half of blundering affection, half of\r\nirrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she\r\nhad always foreseen, brought back some of his habitual firmness and\r\nself-command. He had felt ill on his journey home\xe2\x80\x94he told her when she\r\ncame down\xe2\x80\x94had stayed all night at Tredddleston for that reason; and a\r\nbad headache, that still hung about him this morning, accounted for his\r\npaleness and heavy eyes.\r\n\r\nHe determined to go to the village, in the first place, attend to his\r\nbusiness for an hour, and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to\r\ngo on a journey, which he must beg him not to mention to any one; for\r\nhe wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near breakfast-time, when the\r\nchildren and servants would be in the house-place, and there must be\r\nexclamations in their hearing about his having returned without Hetty.\r\nHe waited until the clock struck nine before he left the work-yard at\r\nthe village, and set off, through the fields, towards the Farm. It was\r\nan immense relief to him, as he came near the Home Close, to see Mr.\r\nPoyser advancing towards him, for this would spare him the pain of\r\ngoing to the house. Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning,\r\nwith a sense of spring business on his mind: he was going to cast the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s eye on the shoeing of a new cart-horse, carrying his spud as a\r\nuseful companion by the way. His surprise was great when he caught\r\nsight of Adam, but he was not a man given to presentiments of evil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Adam, lad, is\xe2\x80\x99t you? Have ye been all this time away and not\r\nbrought the lasses back, after all? Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not brought \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, turning round, to indicate that\r\nhe wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin, looking with sharper attention at Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cye look\r\nbad. Is there anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cA sad thing\xe2\x80\x99s happened. I didna find Hetty\r\nat Snowfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured face showed signs of troubled astonishment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot find her? What\xe2\x80\x99s happened to her?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, his thoughts flying at\r\nonce to bodily accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell, whether anything\xe2\x80\x99s happened to her. She never went\r\nto Snowfield\xe2\x80\x94she took the coach to Stoniton, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t learn nothing\r\nof her after she got down from the Stoniton coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you donna mean she\xe2\x80\x99s run away?\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin, standing still, so\r\npuzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a\r\ntrouble by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must ha\xe2\x80\x99 done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t like our marriage when it\r\ncame to the point\xe2\x80\x94that must be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d mistook her feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin was silent for a minute or two, looking on the ground and\r\nrooting up the grass with his spud, without knowing what he was doing.\r\nHis usual slowness was always trebled when the subject of speech was\r\npainful. At last he looked up, right in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThen she\r\ndidna deserve t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 ye, my lad. An\xe2\x80\x99 I feel i\xe2\x80\x99 fault myself, for she\r\nwas my niece, and I was allays hot for her marr\xe2\x80\x99ing ye. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\namends I can make ye, lad\xe2\x80\x94the more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity: it\xe2\x80\x99s a sad cut-up for\r\nye, I doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam could say nothing; and Mr. Poyser, after pursuing his walk for a\r\nlittle while, went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound she\xe2\x80\x99s gone after trying to get a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s maid\xe2\x80\x99s place, for she\xe2\x80\x99d got that in her head half a year ago,\r\nand wanted me to gi\xe2\x80\x99 my consent. But I\xe2\x80\x99d thought better on her\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nadded, shaking his head slowly and sadly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d thought better on her,\r\nnor to look for this, after she\xe2\x80\x99d gi\xe2\x80\x99en y\xe2\x80\x99 her word, an\xe2\x80\x99 everything\r\nbeen got ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr.\r\nPoyser, and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true. He\r\nhad no warrant for the _certainty_ that she was gone to Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was better it should be so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as quietly as he could, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nshe felt she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me for a husband. Better run away before\r\nthan repent after. I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t look harshly on her if she comes\r\nback, as she may do if she finds it hard to get on away from home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna look on her as I\xe2\x80\x99ve done before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin decisively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s acted bad by you, and by all of us. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll not turn my back on\r\nher: she\xe2\x80\x99s but a young un, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the first harm I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed on her.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a hard job for me to tell her aunt. Why didna Dinah come back\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 ye? She\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 helped to pacify her aunt a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at Snowfield. She\xe2\x80\x99s been gone to Leeds this fortnight,\r\nand I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t learn from th\xe2\x80\x99 old woman any direction where she is at\r\nLeeds, else I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d a deal better be staying wi\xe2\x80\x99 her own kin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser,\r\nindignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthan going preaching among strange folks a-that\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you now, Mr. Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve a deal to see\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, you\xe2\x80\x99d best be after your business, and I must tell the missis\r\nwhen I go home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg particular, you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep what\xe2\x80\x99s happened quiet\r\nfor a week or two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not told my mother yet, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing\r\nhow things may turn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye; least said, soonest mended. We\xe2\x80\x99n no need to say why the\r\nmatch is broke off, an\xe2\x80\x99 we may hear of her after a bit. Shake hands wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme, lad: I wish I could make thee amends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s throat at that moment which\r\ncaused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion.\r\nYet Adam knew what they meant all the better, and the two honest men\r\ngrasped each other\xe2\x80\x99s hard hands in mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off. He had told Seth\r\nto go to the Chase and leave a message for the squire, saying that Adam\r\nBede had been obliged to start off suddenly on a journey\xe2\x80\x94and to say as\r\nmuch, and no more, to any one else who made inquiries about him. If the\r\nPoysers learned that he was gone away again, Adam knew they would infer\r\nthat he was gone in search of Hetty.\r\n\r\nHe had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm, but now the\r\nimpulse which had frequently visited him before\xe2\x80\x94to go to Mr. Irwine,\r\nand make a confidant of him\xe2\x80\x94recurred with the new force which belongs\r\nto a last opportunity. He was about to start on a long journey\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndifficult one\xe2\x80\x94by sea\xe2\x80\x94and no soul would know where he was gone. If\r\nanything happened to him? Or, if he absolutely needed help in any\r\nmatter concerning Hetty? Mr. Irwine was to be trusted; and the feeling\r\nwhich made Adam shrink from telling anything which was _her_ secret\r\nmust give way before the need there was that she should have some one\r\nelse besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst\r\nextremity. Towards Arthur, even though he might have incurred no new\r\nguilt, Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest called on him to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, when these thoughts, which had spread\r\nthemselves through hours of his sad journeying, now rushed upon him in\r\nan instant, like a wave that had been slowly gathering; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the right\r\nthing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand alone in this way any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX\r\nThe Tidings\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam turned his face towards Broxton and walked with his swiftest\r\nstride, looking at his watch with the fear that Mr. Irwine might be\r\ngone out\xe2\x80\x94hunting, perhaps. The fear and haste together produced a state\r\nof strong excitement before he reached the rectory gate, and outside it\r\nhe saw the deep marks of a recent hoof on the gravel.\r\n\r\nBut the hoofs were turned towards the gate, not away from it, and\r\nthough there was a horse against the stable door, it was not Mr.\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x99s: it had evidently had a journey this morning, and must belong\r\nto some one who had come on business. Mr. Irwine was at home, then; but\r\nAdam could hardly find breath and calmness to tell Carroll that he\r\nwanted to speak to the rector. The double suffering of certain and\r\nuncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man. The butler looked\r\nat him wonderingly, as he threw himself on a bench in the passage and\r\nstared absently at the clock on the opposite wall. The master had\r\nsomebody with him, he said, but he heard the study door open\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstranger seemed to be coming out, and as Adam was in a hurry, he would\r\nlet the master know at once.\r\n\r\nAdam sat looking at the clock: the minute-hand was hurrying along the\r\nlast five minutes to ten with a loud, hard, indifferent tick, and Adam\r\nwatched the movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some\r\nreason for doing so. In our times of bitter suffering there are almost\r\nalways these pauses, when our consciousness is benumbed to everything\r\nbut some trivial perception or sensation. It is as if semi-idiocy came\r\nto give us rest from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us\r\nin our sleep.\r\n\r\nCarroll, coming back, recalled Adam to the sense of his burden. He was\r\nto go into the study immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what that strange\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s come about,\xe2\x80\x9d the butler added, from mere incontinence of\r\nremark, as he preceded Adam to the door, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s gone i\xe2\x80\x99 the dining-room.\r\nAnd master looks unaccountable\xe2\x80\x94as if he was frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d Adam took no\r\nnotice of the words: he could not care about other people\xe2\x80\x99s business.\r\nBut when he entered the study and looked in Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s face, he felt\r\nin an instant that there was a new expression in it, strangely\r\ndifferent from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before.\r\nA letter lay open on the table, and Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s hand was on it, but\r\nthe changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to\r\npreoccupation with some disagreeable business, for he was looking\r\neagerly towards the door, as if Adam\xe2\x80\x99s entrance were a matter of\r\npoignant anxiety to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to speak to me, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in that low constrainedly\r\nquiet tone which a man uses when he is determined to suppress\r\nagitation. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down here.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to a chair just opposite to him,\r\nat no more than a yard\xe2\x80\x99s distance from his own, and Adam sat down with\r\na sense that this cold manner of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s gave an additional\r\nunexpected difficulty to his disclosure. But when Adam had made up his\r\nmind to a measure, he was not the man to renounce it for any but\r\nimperative reasons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas the gentleman I look up to most of\r\nanybody. I\xe2\x80\x99ve something very painful to tell you\xe2\x80\x94something as it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npain you to hear as well as me to tell. But if I speak o\xe2\x80\x99 the wrong\r\nother people have done, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak till I\xe2\x80\x99d good\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine nodded slowly, and Adam went on rather tremulously, \xe2\x80\x9cYou was\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 married me and Hetty Sorrel, you know, sir, o\xe2\x80\x99 the fifteenth o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthis month. I thought she loved me, and I was th\xe2\x80\x99 happiest man i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nparish. But a dreadful blow\xe2\x80\x99s come upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine started up from his chair, as if involuntarily, but then,\r\ndetermined to control himself, walked to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone away, sir, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. She said she was going\r\nto Snowfield o\xe2\x80\x99 Friday was a fortnight, and I went last Sunday to fetch\r\nher back; but she\xe2\x80\x99d never been there, and she took the coach to\r\nStoniton, and beyond that I can\xe2\x80\x99t trace her. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m going a long\r\njourney to look for her, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t trust t\xe2\x80\x99 anybody but you where I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine came back from the window and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no idea of the reason why she went away?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like it when it came so near. But that isn\xe2\x80\x99t all, I doubt.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something else I must tell you, sir. There\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\r\nconcerned besides me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gleam of something\xe2\x80\x94it was almost like relief or joy\xe2\x80\x94came across the\r\neager anxiety of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s face at that moment. Adam was looking on\r\nthe ground, and paused a little: the next words were hard to speak. But\r\nwhen he went on, he lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr.\r\nIrwine. He would do the thing he had resolved to do, without flinching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know who\xe2\x80\x99s the man I\xe2\x80\x99ve reckoned my greatest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand used to be proud to think as I should pass my life i\xe2\x80\x99 working for\r\nhim, and had felt so ever since we were lads....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine, as if all self-control had forsaken him, grasped Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, which lay on the table, and, clutching it tightly like a man in\r\npain, said, with pale lips and a low hurried voice, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Adam, no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam, surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s feeling, repented of\r\nthe words that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence. The\r\ngrasp on his arm gradually relaxed, and Mr. Irwine threw himself back\r\nin his chair, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94I must know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man played with Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and behaved to her as he\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nright to do to a girl in her station o\xe2\x80\x99 life\xe2\x80\x94made her presents and used\r\nto go and meet her out a-walking. I found it out only two days before\r\nhe went away\xe2\x80\x94found him a-kissing her as they were parting in the Grove.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99d been nothing said between me and Hetty then, though I\xe2\x80\x99d loved\r\nher for a long while, and she knew it. But I reproached him with his\r\nwrong actions, and words and blows passed between us; and he said\r\nsolemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more\r\nthan a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 flirting. But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d meant nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t understood at the time, as he\xe2\x80\x99d got hold of her heart, and I\r\nthought she\xe2\x80\x99d belike go on thinking of him and never come to love\r\nanother man as wanted to marry her. And I gave her the letter, and she\r\nseemed to bear it all after a while better than I\xe2\x80\x99d expected... and she\r\nbehaved kinder and kinder to me... I daresay she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her own\r\nfeelings then, poor thing, and they came back upon her when it was too\r\nlate... I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blame her... I can\xe2\x80\x99t think as she meant to\r\ndeceive me. But I was encouraged to think she loved me, and\xe2\x80\x94you know\r\nthe rest, sir. But it\xe2\x80\x99s on my mind as he\xe2\x80\x99s been false to me, and \xe2\x80\x99ticed\r\nher away, and she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to him\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m going now to see, for I can\r\nnever go to work again till I know what\xe2\x80\x99s become of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring Adam\xe2\x80\x99s narrative, Mr. Irwine had had time to recover his\r\nself-mastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him. It\r\nwas a bitter remembrance to him now\xe2\x80\x94that morning when Arthur\r\nbreakfasted with him and seemed as if he were on the verge of a\r\nconfession. It was plain enough _now_ what he had wanted to confess.\r\nAnd if their words had taken another turn... if he himself had been\r\nless fastidious about intruding on another man\xe2\x80\x99s secrets... it was\r\ncruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt\r\nand misery. He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination\r\nwhich the present sheds back upon the past. But every other feeling as\r\nit rushed upon him was thrown into abeyance by pity, deep respectful\r\npity, for the man who sat before him\xe2\x80\x94already so bruised, going forth\r\nwith sad blind resignedness to an unreal sorrow, while a real one was\r\nclose upon him, too far beyond the range of common trial for him ever\r\nto have feared it. His own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that\r\ncomes over us in the presence of a great anguish, for the anguish he\r\nmust inflict on Adam was already present to him. Again he put his hand\r\non the arm that lay on the table, but very gently this time, as he said\r\nsolemnly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam, my dear friend, you have had some hard trials in your life. You\r\ncan bear sorrow manfully, as well as act manfully. God requires both\r\ntasks at our hands. And there is a heavier sorrow coming upon you than\r\nany you have yet known. But you are not guilty\xe2\x80\x94you have not the worst\r\nof all sorrows. God help him who has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two pale faces looked at each other; in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s there was trembling\r\nsuspense, in Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s hesitating, shrinking pity. But he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had news of Hetty this morning. She is not gone to _him_. She\r\nis in Stonyshire\xe2\x80\x94at Stoniton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam started up from his chair, as if he thought he could have leaped\r\nto her that moment. But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said,\r\npersuasively, \xe2\x80\x9cWait, Adam, wait.\xe2\x80\x9d So he sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in a very unhappy position\xe2\x80\x94one which will make it worse for you\r\nto find her, my poor friend, than to have lost her for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s lips moved tremulously, but no sound came. They moved again, and\r\nhe whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been arrested... she is in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of\r\nresistance into Adam. The blood rushed to his face, and he said, loudly\r\nand sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a great crime\xe2\x80\x94the murder of her child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _can\xe2\x80\x99t be!_\xe2\x80\x9d Adam almost shouted, starting up from his chair and\r\nmaking a stride towards the door; but he turned round again, setting\r\nhis back against the bookcase, and looking fiercely at Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t possible. She never had a child. She can\xe2\x80\x99t be guilty. _Who_ says\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant she may be innocent, Adam. We can still hope she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who says she is guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam violently. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a letter from the magistrate before whom she was taken, and\r\nthe constable who arrested her is in the dining-room. She will not\r\nconfess her name or where she comes from; but I fear, I fear, there can\r\nbe no doubt it is Hetty. The description of her person corresponds,\r\nonly that she is said to look very pale and ill. She had a small\r\nred-leather pocket-book in her pocket with two names written in it\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nat the beginning, \xe2\x80\x98Hetty Sorrel, Hayslope,\xe2\x80\x99 and the other near the end,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dinah Morris, Snowfield.\xe2\x80\x99 She will not say which is her own name\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndenies everything, and will answer no questions, and application has\r\nbeen made to me, as a magistrate, that I may take measures for\r\nidentifying her, for it was thought probable that the name which stands\r\nfirst is her own name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what proof have they got against her, if it _is_ Hetty?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAdam, still violently, with an effort that seemed to shake his whole\r\nframe. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not believe it. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, and none of us know\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible proof that she was under the temptation to commit the crime;\r\nbut we have room to hope that she did not really commit it. Try and\r\nread that letter, Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam took the letter between his shaking hands and tried to fix his\r\neyes steadily on it. Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders.\r\nWhen he came back, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were still on the first page\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nread\xe2\x80\x94he could not put the words together and make out what they meant.\r\nHe threw it down at last and clenched his fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _his_ doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s been any crime, it\xe2\x80\x99s at his\r\ndoor, not at hers. _He_ taught her to deceive\xe2\x80\x94_he_ deceived me first.\r\nLet \xe2\x80\x99em put _him_ on his trial\xe2\x80\x94let him stand in court beside her, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x99em how he got hold of her heart, and \xe2\x80\x99ticed her t\xe2\x80\x99 evil, and\r\nthen lied to me. Is _he_ to go free, while they lay all the punishment\r\non her... so weak and young?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe image called up by these last words gave a new direction to poor\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s maddened feelings. He was silent, looking at the corner of the\r\nroom as if he saw something there. Then he burst out again, in a tone\r\nof appealing anguish,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ bear it... O God, it\xe2\x80\x99s too hard to lay upon me\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too hard\r\nto think she\xe2\x80\x99s wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine had sat down again in silence. He was too wise to utter\r\nsoothing words at present, and indeed, the sight of Adam before him,\r\nwith that look of sudden age which sometimes comes over a young face in\r\nmoments of terrible emotion\xe2\x80\x94the hard bloodless look of the skin, the\r\ndeep lines about the quivering mouth, the furrows in the brow\xe2\x80\x94the sight\r\nof this strong firm man shattered by the invisible stroke of sorrow,\r\nmoved him so deeply that speech was not easy. Adam stood motionless,\r\nwith his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two; in that\r\nshort space he was living through all his love again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still without moving his eyes, as if\r\nhe were only talking to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cit was fear made her hide it... I\r\nforgive her for deceiving me... I forgive thee, Hetty... thee wast\r\ndeceived too... it\xe2\x80\x99s gone hard wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee, my poor Hetty... but they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever make me believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent again for a few moments, and then he said, with fierce\r\nabruptness, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him back\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him go and\r\nlook at her in her misery\xe2\x80\x94he shall look at her till he can\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it shall follow him night and day\xe2\x80\x94as long as he lives it shall\r\nfollow him\xe2\x80\x94he shan\xe2\x80\x99t escape wi\xe2\x80\x99 lies this time\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndrag him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the act of going towards the door, Adam paused automatically and\r\nlooked about for his hat, quite unconscious where he was or who was\r\npresent with him. Mr. Irwine had followed him, and now took him by the\r\narm, saying, in a quiet but decided tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Adam, no; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will wish to stay and see what good can be\r\ndone for _her_, instead of going on a useless errand of vengeance. The\r\npunishment will surely fall without your aid. Besides, he is no longer\r\nin Ireland. He must be on his way home\xe2\x80\x94or would be, long before you\r\narrived, for his grandfather, I know, wrote for him to come at least\r\nten days ago. I want you now to go with me to Stoniton. I have ordered\r\na horse for you to ride with us, as soon as you can compose yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Irwine was speaking, Adam recovered his consciousness of the\r\nactual scene. He rubbed his hair off his forehead and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Irwine went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are others to think of, and act\r\nfor, besides yourself, Adam: there are Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s friends, the good\r\nPoysers, on whom this stroke will fall more heavily than I can bear to\r\nthink. I expect it from your strength of mind, Adam\xe2\x80\x94from your sense of\r\nduty to God and man\xe2\x80\x94that you will try to act as long as action can be\r\nof any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn reality, Mr. Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for Adam\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nsake. Movement, with some object before him, was the best means of\r\ncounteracting the violence of suffering in these first hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ go with me to Stoniton, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to see if it is really Hetty who is there, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do what you think right. But the folks at\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 Hall Farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish them not to know till I return to tell them myself. I shall\r\nhave ascertained things then which I am uncertain about now, and I\r\nshall return as soon as possible. Come now, the horses are ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL\r\nThe Bitter Waters Spread\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine returned from Stoniton in a post-chaise that night, and the\r\nfirst words Carroll said to him, as he entered the house, were, that\r\nSquire Donnithorne was dead\xe2\x80\x94found dead in his bed at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock that\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94and that Mrs. Irwine desired him to say she should be awake\r\nwhen Mr. Irwine came home, and she begged him not to go to bed without\r\nseeing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dauphin,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Irwine said, as her son entered her room, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncome at last. So the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s fidgetiness and low spirits, which\r\nmade him send for Arthur in that sudden way, really meant something. I\r\nsuppose Carroll has told you that Donnithorne was found dead in his bed\r\nthis morning. You will believe my prognostications another time, though\r\nI daresay I shan\xe2\x80\x99t live to prognosticate anything but my own death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have they done about Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cSent a messenger\r\nto await him at Liverpool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ralph was gone before the news was brought to us. Dear Arthur, I\r\nshall live now to see him master at the Chase, and making good times on\r\nthe estate, like a generous-hearted fellow as he is. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be as happy\r\nas a king now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine could not help giving a slight groan: he was worn with\r\nanxiety and exertion, and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s light words were almost\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you so dismal about, Dauphin? Is there any bad news? Or are\r\nyou thinking of the danger for Arthur in crossing that frightful Irish\r\nChannel at this time of year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother, I\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of that; but I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to rejoice\r\njust now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been worried by this law business that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Stoniton\r\nabout. What in the world is it, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will know by and by, mother. It would not be right for me to tell\r\nyou at present. Good-night: you\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep now you have no longer\r\nanything to listen for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet Arthur,\r\nsince it would not now hasten his return: the news of his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath would bring him as soon as he could possibly come. He could go to\r\nbed now and get some needful rest, before the time came for the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm\r\nand to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s home.\r\n\r\nAdam himself was not come back from Stoniton, for though he shrank from\r\nseeing Hetty, he could not bear to go to a distance from her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the rector, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use for me to go\r\nback. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to work again while she\xe2\x80\x99s here, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nthe sight o\xe2\x80\x99 the things and folks round home. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a bit of a room\r\nhere, where I can see the prison walls, and perhaps I shall get, in\r\ntime, to bear seeing _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had not been shaken in his belief that Hetty was innocent of the\r\ncrime she was charged with, for Mr. Irwine, feeling that the belief in\r\nher guilt would be a crushing addition to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s load, had kept from\r\nhim the facts which left no hope in his own mind. There was not any\r\nreason for thrusting the whole burden on Adam at once, and Mr. Irwine,\r\nat parting, only said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the evidence should tell too strongly\r\nagainst her, Adam, we may still hope for a pardon. Her youth and other\r\ncircumstances will be a plea for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and it\xe2\x80\x99s right people should know how she was tempted into the\r\nwrong way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, with bitter earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s right they should\r\nknow it was a fine gentleman made love to her, and turned her head wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnotions. You\xe2\x80\x99ll remember, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to tell my mother, and\r\nSeth, and the people at the farm, who it was as led her wrong, else\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll think harder of her than she deserves. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing her a\r\nhurt by sparing him, and I hold him the guiltiest before God, let her\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 done what she may. If you spare him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll expose him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your demand is just, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when you are\r\ncalmer, you will judge Arthur more mercifully. I say nothing now, only\r\nthat his punishment is in other hands than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s sad part in the story of sin and sorrow\xe2\x80\x94he who cared for\r\nArthur with fatherly affection, who had cared for him with fatherly\r\npride. But he saw clearly that the secret must be known before long,\r\neven apart from Adam\xe2\x80\x99s determination, since it was scarcely to be\r\nsupposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her obstinate silence.\r\nHe made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers, but to tell\r\nthem the worst at once, for there was no time to rob the tidings of\r\ntheir suddenness. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s trial must come on at the Lent assizes, and\r\nthey were to be held at Stoniton the next week. It was scarcely to be\r\nhoped that Martin Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a\r\nwitness, and it was better he should know everything as long beforehand\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nBefore ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a\r\nhouse of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death. The\r\nsense of family dishonour was too keen even in the kind-hearted Martin\r\nPoyser the younger to leave room for any compassion towards Hetty. He\r\nand his father were simple-minded farmers, proud of their untarnished\r\ncharacter, proud that they came of a family which had held up its head\r\nand paid its way as far back as its name was in the parish register;\r\nand Hetty had brought disgrace on them all\xe2\x80\x94disgrace that could never be\r\nwiped out. That was the all-conquering feeling in the mind both of\r\nfather and son\xe2\x80\x94the scorching sense of disgrace, which neutralised all\r\nother sensibility\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe\r\nthat Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband. We are often\r\nstartled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions; the\r\nreason is, that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke of\r\ntraditional impressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to bring her\r\noff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone, while the old\r\ngrandfather was crying in the opposite chair, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go nigh\r\nher, nor ever see her again, by my own will. She\xe2\x80\x99s made our bread\r\nbitter to us for all our lives to come, an\xe2\x80\x99 we shall ne\xe2\x80\x99er hold up our\r\nheads i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish nor i\xe2\x80\x99 any other. The parson talks o\xe2\x80\x99 folks\r\npitying us: it\xe2\x80\x99s poor amends pity \xe2\x80\x99ull make us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity?\xe2\x80\x9d said the grandfather, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI ne\xe2\x80\x99er wanted folks\xe2\x80\x99s pity i\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_my_ life afore... an\xe2\x80\x99 I mun begin to be looked down on now, an\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\nturned seventy-two last St. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s, an\xe2\x80\x99 all th\xe2\x80\x99 underbearers and\r\npall-bearers as I\xe2\x80\x99n picked for my funeral are i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish and the\r\nnext to \xe2\x80\x99t.... It\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99 no use now... I mun be ta\xe2\x80\x99en to the grave by\r\nstrangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fret so, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, who had spoken very little,\r\nbeing almost overawed by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s unusual hardness and decision.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have your children wi\xe2\x80\x99 you; an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s the lads and the little\r\nun \xe2\x80\x99ull grow up in a new parish as well as i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 old un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no staying i\xe2\x80\x99 this country for us now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser,\r\nand the hard tears trickled slowly down his round cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud be bad luck if the old squire gave us notice this Lady day, but\r\nI must gi\xe2\x80\x99 notice myself now, an\xe2\x80\x99 see if there can anybody be got to\r\ncome an\xe2\x80\x99 take to the crops as I\xe2\x80\x99n put i\xe2\x80\x99 the ground; for I wonna stay\r\nupo\xe2\x80\x99 that man\xe2\x80\x99s land a day longer nor I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to\xe2\x80\x99t. An\xe2\x80\x99 me, as\r\nthought him such a good upright young man, as I should be glad when he\r\ncome to be our landlord. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er lift my hat to him again, nor sit\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the same church wi\xe2\x80\x99 him... a man as has brought shame on respectable\r\nfolks... an\xe2\x80\x99 pretended to be such a friend t\xe2\x80\x99 everybody.... Poor Adam\r\nthere... a fine friend he\xe2\x80\x99s been t\xe2\x80\x99 Adam, making speeches an\xe2\x80\x99 talking\r\nso fine, an\xe2\x80\x99 all the while poisoning the lad\xe2\x80\x99s life, as it\xe2\x80\x99s much if he\r\ncan stay i\xe2\x80\x99 this country any more nor we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 to go into court, and own you\xe2\x80\x99re akin t\xe2\x80\x99 her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99ll cast it up to the little un, as isn\xe2\x80\x99t four \xe2\x80\x99ear\r\nold, some day\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll cast it up t\xe2\x80\x99 her as she\xe2\x80\x99d a cousin tried at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99sizes for murder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be their own wickedness, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, with a sob in\r\nher voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s One above \xe2\x80\x99ull take care o\xe2\x80\x99 the innicent child,\r\nelse it\xe2\x80\x99s but little truth they tell us at church. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be harder nor\r\never to die an\xe2\x80\x99 leave the little uns, an\xe2\x80\x99 nobody to be a mother to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better ha\xe2\x80\x99 sent for Dinah, if we\xe2\x80\x99d known where she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPoyser; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Adam said she\xe2\x80\x99d left no direction where she\xe2\x80\x99d be at\r\nLeeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99d be wi\xe2\x80\x99 that woman as was a friend t\xe2\x80\x99 her Aunt Judith,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Poyser, comforted a little by this suggestion of her husband.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often heard Dinah talk of her, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember what name she\r\ncalled her by. But there\xe2\x80\x99s Seth Bede; he\xe2\x80\x99s like enough to know, for\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a preaching woman as the Methodists think a deal on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send to Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send Alick to tell him to\r\ncome, or else to send up word o\xe2\x80\x99 the woman\xe2\x80\x99s name, an\xe2\x80\x99 thee canst write\r\na letter ready to send off to Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on as soon as we can make out a\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s poor work writing letters when you want folks to come to you i\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cHappen it\xe2\x80\x99ll be ever so long on the road,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 never reach her at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Alick arrived with the message, Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts too had\r\nalready flown to Dinah, and she had said to Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ncomfort for us i\xe2\x80\x99 this world any more, wi\xe2\x80\x99out thee couldst get Dinah\r\nMorris to come to us, as she did when my old man died. I\xe2\x80\x99d like her to\r\ncome in an\xe2\x80\x99 take me by th\xe2\x80\x99 hand again, an\xe2\x80\x99 talk to me. She\xe2\x80\x99d tell me\r\nthe rights on\xe2\x80\x99t, belike\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d happen know some good i\xe2\x80\x99 all this trouble\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 heart-break comin\xe2\x80\x99 upo\xe2\x80\x99 that poor lad, as ne\xe2\x80\x99er done a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 wrong\r\nin\xe2\x80\x99s life, but war better nor anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s son, pick the country\r\nround. Eh, my lad... Adam, my poor lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee wouldstna like me to leave thee, to go and fetch Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSeth, as his mother sobbed and rocked herself to and fro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, looking up and pausing from her grief, like\r\na crying child who hears some promise of consolation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what place\r\nis\xe2\x80\x99t she\xe2\x80\x99s at, do they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good way off, mother\xe2\x80\x94Leeds, a big town. But I could be back in\r\nthree days, if thee couldst spare me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, I canna spare thee. Thee must go an\xe2\x80\x99 see thy brother, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbring me word what he\xe2\x80\x99s a-doin\xe2\x80\x99. Mester Irwine said he\xe2\x80\x99d come an\xe2\x80\x99 tell\r\nme, but I canna make out so well what it means when he tells me. Thee\r\nmust go thysen, sin\xe2\x80\x99 Adam wonna let me go to him. Write a letter to\r\nDinah canstna? Thee\xe2\x80\x99t fond enough o\xe2\x80\x99 writin\xe2\x80\x99 when nobody wants thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where she\xe2\x80\x99d be i\xe2\x80\x99 that big town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d gone\r\nmyself, I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 found out by asking the members o\xe2\x80\x99 the Society. But\r\nperhaps if I put Sarah Williamson, Methodist preacher, Leeds, o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\noutside, it might get to her; for most like she\xe2\x80\x99d be wi\xe2\x80\x99 Sarah\r\nWilliamson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlick came now with the message, and Seth, finding that Mrs. Poyser was\r\nwriting to Dinah, gave up the intention of writing himself; but he went\r\nto the Hall Farm to tell them all he could suggest about the address of\r\nthe letter, and warn them that there might be some delay in the\r\ndelivery, from his not knowing an exact direction.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Lisbeth, Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge, who had also\r\na claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from\r\nbusiness for some time; and before six o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening there were\r\nfew people in Broxton and Hayslope who had not heard the sad news. Mr.\r\nIrwine had not mentioned Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s name to Burge, and yet the story of\r\nhis conduct towards Hetty, with all the dark shadows cast upon it by\r\nits terrible consequences, was presently as well known as that his\r\ngrandfather was dead, and that he was come into the estate. For Martin\r\nPoyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two neighbours\r\nwho ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the first\r\nday of his trouble; and Carroll, who kept his ears open to all that\r\npassed at the rectory, had framed an inferential version of the story,\r\nand found early opportunities of communicating it.\r\n\r\nOne of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook him by the\r\nhand without speaking for some minutes was Bartle Massey. He had shut\r\nup his school, and was on his way to the rectory, where he arrived\r\nabout half-past seven in the evening, and, sending his duty to Mr.\r\nIrwine, begged pardon for troubling him at that hour, but had something\r\nparticular on his mind. He was shown into the study, where Mr. Irwine\r\nsoon joined him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bartle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, putting out his hand. That was not his\r\nusual way of saluting the schoolmaster, but trouble makes us treat all\r\nwho feel with us very much alike. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I\xe2\x80\x99m come about as well as I do, sir, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBartle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to know the truth about the sad news that has reached you...\r\nabout Hetty Sorrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, what I wish to know is about Adam Bede. I understand you\r\nleft him at Stoniton, and I beg the favour of you to tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstate of the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and what he means to do. For as for that\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 pink-and-white they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the trouble to put in jail, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nvalue her a rotten nut\xe2\x80\x94not a rotten nut\xe2\x80\x94only for the harm or good that\r\nmay come out of her to an honest man\xe2\x80\x94a lad I\xe2\x80\x99ve set such store\r\nby\xe2\x80\x94trusted to, that he\xe2\x80\x99d make my bit o\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge go a good way in the\r\nworld.... Why, sir, he\xe2\x80\x99s the only scholar I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in this stupid\r\ncountry that ever had the will or the head-piece for mathematics. If he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t had so much hard work to do, poor fellow, he might have gone\r\ninto the higher branches, and then this might never have happened\xe2\x80\x94might\r\nnever have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated frame\r\nof mind, and was not able to check himself on this first occasion of\r\nventing his feelings. But he paused now to rub his moist forehead, and\r\nprobably his moist eyes also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when this pause had given him time to\r\nreflect, \xe2\x80\x9cfor running on in this way about my own feelings, like that\r\nfoolish dog of mine howling in a storm, when there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody wants to\r\nlisten to me. I came to hear you speak, not to talk myself\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake the trouble to tell me what the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself under any restraint, Bartle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nfact is, I\xe2\x80\x99m very much in the same condition as you just now; I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\ngreat deal that\xe2\x80\x99s painful on my mind, and I find it hard work to be\r\nquite silent about my own feelings and only attend to others. I share\r\nyour concern for Adam, though he is not the only one whose sufferings I\r\ncare for in this affair. He intends to remain at Stoniton till after\r\nthe trial: it will come on probably a week to-morrow. He has taken a\r\nroom there, and I encouraged him to do so, because I think it better he\r\nshould be away from his own home at present; and, poor fellow, he still\r\nbelieves Hetty is innocent\xe2\x80\x94he wants to summon up courage to see her if\r\nhe can; he is unwilling to leave the spot where she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the creatur\xe2\x80\x99s guilty, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll hang her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is very strong. And\r\none bad symptom is that she denies everything\xe2\x80\x94denies that she has had a\r\nchild in the face of the most positive evidence. I saw her myself, and\r\nshe was obstinately silent to me; she shrank up like a frightened\r\nanimal when she saw me. I was never so shocked in my life as at the\r\nchange in her. But I trust that, in the worst case, we may obtain a\r\npardon for the sake of the innocent who are involved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, forgetting in his irritation to whom\r\nhe was speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s stuff and\r\nnonsense for the innocent to care about her being hanged. For my own\r\npart, I think the sooner such women are put out o\xe2\x80\x99 the world the\r\nbetter; and the men that help \xe2\x80\x99em to do mischief had better go along\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em for that matter. What good will you do by keeping such vermin\r\nalive, eating the victual that \xe2\x80\x99ud feed rational beings? But if Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfool enough to care about it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to suffer more than\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneedful.... Is he very much cut up, poor fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d Bartle added, taking\r\nout his spectacles and putting them on, as if they would assist his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the grief cuts very deep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks\r\nterribly shattered, and a certain violence came over him now and then\r\nyesterday, which made me wish I could have remained near him. But I\r\nshall go to Stoniton again to-morrow, and I have confidence enough in\r\nthe strength of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s principle to trust that he will be able to\r\nendure the worst without being driven to anything rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Irwine, who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than\r\naddressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence, had in his mind the\r\npossibility that the spirit of vengeance towards Arthur, which was the\r\nform Adam\xe2\x80\x99s anguish was continually taking, might make him seek an\r\nencounter that was likely to end more fatally than the one in the\r\nGrove. This possibility heightened the anxiety with which he looked\r\nforward to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. But Bartle thought Mr. Irwine was\r\nreferring to suicide, and his face wore a new alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I have in my head, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll approve of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to shut up my school\xe2\x80\x94if the scholars\r\ncome, they must go back again, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94and I shall go to Stoniton\r\nand look after Adam till this business is over. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m come\r\nto look on at the assizes; he can\xe2\x80\x99t object to that. What do you think\r\nabout it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be some real\r\nadvantages in that... and I honour you for your friendship towards him,\r\nBartle. But... you must be careful what you say to him, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid you have too little fellow-feeling in what you consider his\r\nweakness about Hetty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust to me, sir\xe2\x80\x94trust to me. I know what you mean. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fool\r\nmyself in my time, but that\xe2\x80\x99s between you and me. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t thrust\r\nmyself on him only keep my eye on him, and see that he gets some good\r\nfood, and put in a word here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartle\xe2\x80\x99s discretion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing a good deed; and it will be well for you to\r\nlet Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mother and brother know that you\xe2\x80\x99re going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, rising, and taking off his spectacles,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that; though the mother\xe2\x80\x99s a whimpering thing\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to come within earshot of her; however, she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nstraight-backed, clean woman, none of your slatterns. I wish you\r\ngood-bye, sir, and thank you for the time you\xe2\x80\x99ve spared me. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s friend in this business\xe2\x80\x94everybody\xe2\x80\x99s friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s a heavy\r\nweight you\xe2\x80\x99ve got on your shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Bartle, till we meet at Stoniton, as I daresay we shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartle hurried away from the rectory, evading Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s conversational\r\nadvances, and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen, whose short legs\r\npattered beside him on the gravel, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I shall be obliged to take you\r\nwith me, you good-for-nothing woman. You\xe2\x80\x99d go fretting yourself to\r\ndeath if I left you\xe2\x80\x94you know you would, and perhaps get snapped up by\r\nsome tramp. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be running into bad company, I expect, putting\r\nyour nose in every hole and corner where you\xe2\x80\x99ve no business! But if you\r\ndo anything disgraceful, I\xe2\x80\x99ll disown you\xe2\x80\x94mind that, madam, mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI\r\nThe Eve of the Trial\r\n\r\n\r\nAn upper room in a dull Stoniton street, with two beds in it\xe2\x80\x94one laid\r\non the floor. It is ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Thursday night, and the dark wall\r\nopposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled\r\nwith the light of the one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is\r\npretending to read, while he is really looking over his spectacles at\r\nAdam Bede, seated near the dark window.\r\n\r\nYou would hardly have known it was Adam without being told. His face\r\nhas got thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the neglected\r\nbeard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs\r\nover his forehead, and there is no active impulse in him which inclines\r\nhim to push it off, that he may be more awake to what is around him. He\r\nhas one arm over the back of the chair, and he seems to be looking down\r\nat his clasped hands. He is roused by a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle Massey, rising hastily and unfastening the\r\ndoor. It was Mr. Irwine.\r\n\r\nAdam rose from his chair with instinctive respect, as Mr. Irwine\r\napproached him and took his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m late, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down on the chair which Bartle\r\nplaced for him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was later in setting off from Broxton than I\r\nintended to be, and I have been incessantly occupied since I arrived. I\r\nhave done everything now, however\xe2\x80\x94everything that can be done to-night,\r\nat least. Let us all sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam took his chair again mechanically, and Bartle, for whom there was\r\nno chair remaining, sat on the bed in the background.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Adam; I and the chaplain have both been with her this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ask her, sir... did you say anything about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke of you. I said\r\nyou wished to see her before the trial, if she consented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Irwine paused, Adam looked at him with eager, questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know she shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It is not only\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her\r\nfellow-creatures. She has scarcely said anything more than \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 either\r\nto me or the chaplain. Three or four days ago, before you were\r\nmentioned to her, when I asked her if there was any one of her family\r\nwhom she would like to see\xe2\x80\x94to whom she could open her mind\xe2\x80\x94she said,\r\nwith a violent shudder, \xe2\x80\x98Tell them not to come near me\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t see any\r\nof them.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s head was hanging down again, and he did not speak. There was\r\nsilence for a few minutes, and then Mr. Irwine said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nadvise you against your own feelings, Adam, if they now urge you\r\nstrongly to go and see her to-morrow morning, even without her consent.\r\nIt is just possible, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, that\r\nthe interview might affect her favourably. But I grieve to say I have\r\nscarcely any hope of that. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem agitated when I mentioned\r\nyour name; she only said \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 in the same cold, obstinate way as\r\nusual. And if the meeting had no good effect on her, it would be pure,\r\nuseless suffering to you\xe2\x80\x94severe suffering, I fear. She is very much\r\nchanged...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam started up from his chair and seized his hat, which lay on the\r\ntable. But he stood still then, and looked at Mr. Irwine, as if he had\r\na question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter. Bartle Massey\r\nrose quietly, turned the key in the door, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he come back?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cLay down your hat, Adam,\r\nunless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air. I fear you\r\nhave not been out again to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking hard at Mr. Irwine\r\nand speaking in a tone of angry suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of\r\nme. I only want justice. I want him to feel what she feels. It\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nwork... she was a child as it \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone t\xe2\x80\x99 anybody\xe2\x80\x99s heart to look\r\nat... I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what she\xe2\x80\x99s done... it was him brought her to it. And\r\nhe shall know it... he shall feel it... if there\xe2\x80\x99s a just God, he shall\r\nfeel what it is t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought a child like her to sin and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not deceiving you, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine. \xe2\x80\x9cArthur Donnithorne is\r\nnot come back\xe2\x80\x94was not come back when I left. I have left a letter for\r\nhim: he will know all as soon as he arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter as she lies there in shame and misery, and he knows\r\nnothing about it\xe2\x80\x94he suffers nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam, he _will_ know\xe2\x80\x94he _will_ suffer, long and bitterly. He has a\r\nheart and a conscience: I can\xe2\x80\x99t be entirely deceived in his character.\r\nI am convinced\xe2\x80\x94I am sure he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall under temptation without a\r\nstruggle. He may be weak, but he is not callous, not coldly selfish. I\r\nam persuaded that this will be a shock of which he will feel the\r\neffects all his life. Why do you crave vengeance in this way? No amount\r\nof torture that you could inflict on _him_ could benefit _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94O God, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam groaned out, sinking on his chair again; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthen, that\xe2\x80\x99s the deepest curse of all... that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the\r\nblackness of it... _it can never be undone_. My poor Hetty... she can\r\nnever be my sweet Hetty again... the prettiest thing God had\r\nmade\xe2\x80\x94smiling up at me... I thought she loved me... and was good...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if\r\nhe were only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at\r\nMr. Irwine, \xe2\x80\x9cBut she isn\xe2\x80\x99t as guilty as they say? You don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\r\nis, sir? She can\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Irwine\r\nanswered gently. \xe2\x80\x9cIn these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what\r\nseems to us strong evidence, and yet, for want of knowing some small\r\nfact, our judgment is wrong. But suppose the worst: you have no right\r\nto say that the guilt of her crime lies with him, and that he ought to\r\nbear the punishment. It is not for us men to apportion the shares of\r\nmoral guilt and retribution. We find it impossible to avoid mistakes\r\neven in determining who has committed a single criminal act, and the\r\nproblem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen\r\nconsequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble to\r\nlook into it. The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act\r\nof selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to\r\nawaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You\r\nhave a mind that can understand this fully, Adam, when you are calm.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I can\xe2\x80\x99t enter into the anguish that drives you into this\r\nstate of revengeful hatred. But think of this: if you were to obey your\r\npassion\xe2\x80\x94for it _is_ passion, and you deceive yourself in calling it\r\njustice\xe2\x80\x94it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur; nay,\r\nworse; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s worse\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsooner do it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself\r\nthan ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought _her_ to do wickedness and then stand by and see \xe2\x80\x99em\r\npunish her while they let me alone; and all for a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pleasure, as,\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d had a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart in him, he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 cut his hand off sooner than\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 taken it. What if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee what\xe2\x80\x99s happened? He\r\nforesaw enough; he\xe2\x80\x99d no right to expect anything but harm and shame to\r\nher. And then he wanted to smooth it off wi\xe2\x80\x99 lies. No\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that. Let a man do\r\nwhat he will, if he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s to bear the punishment himself, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhalf so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t\xe2\x80\x99 himself\r\nand knows all the while the punishment \xe2\x80\x99ll fall on somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of\r\nwrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone; you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nisolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall not\r\nspread. Men\xe2\x80\x99s lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the\r\nair they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I know, I\r\nfeel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s has caused\r\nto others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides\r\nthose who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur\r\nwould simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you\r\ncould not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows\r\non every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind\r\nfury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add\r\nworse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of\r\nvengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such\r\nactions, and as long as you indulge it, as long as you do not see that\r\nto fix your mind on Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s punishment is revenge, and not justice,\r\nyou are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great\r\nwrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had\r\ngiven that blow to Arthur in the Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the\r\npast, and Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle\r\nMassey about old Mr. Donnithorne\xe2\x80\x99s funeral and other matters of an\r\nindifferent kind. But at length Adam turned round and said, in a more\r\nsubdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not asked about \xe2\x80\x99em at th\xe2\x80\x99 Hall Farm, sir. Is Mr.\r\nPoyser coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come; he is in Stoniton to-night. But I could not advise him to\r\nsee you, Adam. His own mind is in a very perturbed state, and it is\r\nbest he should not see you till you are calmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Dinah Morris come to \xe2\x80\x99em, sir? Seth said they\xe2\x80\x99d sent for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Mr. Poyser tells me she was not come when he left. They\xe2\x80\x99re afraid\r\nthe letter has not reached her. It seems they had no exact address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam sat ruminating a little while, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Dinah\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone to see her. But perhaps the Poysers would ha\xe2\x80\x99 been sorely\r\nagainst it, since they won\xe2\x80\x99t come nigh her themselves. But I think she\r\nwould, for the Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons;\r\nand Seth said he thought she would. She\xe2\x80\x99d a very tender way with her,\r\nDinah had; I wonder if she could ha\xe2\x80\x99 done any good. You never saw her,\r\nsir, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did. I had a conversation with her\xe2\x80\x94she pleased me a good deal.\r\nAnd now you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that\r\na gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart. The\r\njail chaplain is rather harsh in his manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99 no use if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d thought of it earlier, I would have taken some measures for\r\nfinding her out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s too late now, I fear...\r\nWell, Adam, I must go now. Try to get some rest to-night. God bless\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you early to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII\r\nThe Morning of the Trial\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next day, Adam was alone in his dull upper room; his\r\nwatch lay before him on the table, as if he were counting the long\r\nminutes. He had no knowledge of what was likely to be said by the\r\nwitnesses on the trial, for he had shrunk from all the particulars\r\nconnected with Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and accusation. This brave active man,\r\nwho would have hastened towards any danger or toil to rescue Hetty from\r\nan apprehended wrong or misfortune, felt himself powerless to\r\ncontemplate irremediable evil and suffering. The susceptibility which\r\nwould have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of\r\naction became helpless anguish when he was obliged to be passive, or\r\nelse sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting justice on\r\nArthur. Energetic natures, strong for all strenuous deeds, will often\r\nrush away from a hopeless sufferer, as if they were hard-hearted. It is\r\nthe overmastering sense of pain that drives them. They shrink by an\r\nungovernable instinct, as they would shrink from laceration. Adam had\r\nbrought himself to think of seeing Hetty, if she would consent to see\r\nhim, because he thought the meeting might possibly be a good to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94might help to melt away this terrible hardness they told him of. If\r\nshe saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him, she might\r\nopen her heart to him. But this resolution had been an immense\r\neffort\xe2\x80\x94he trembled at the thought of seeing her changed face, as a\r\ntimid woman trembles at the thought of the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s knife, and he\r\nchose now to bear the long hours of suspense rather than encounter what\r\nseemed to him the more intolerable agony of witnessing her trial.\r\n\r\nDeep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a\r\nregeneration, the initiation into a new state. The yearning memories,\r\nthe bitter regret, the agonized sympathy, the struggling appeals to the\r\nInvisible Right\xe2\x80\x94all the intense emotions which had filled the days and\r\nnights of the past week, and were compressing themselves again like an\r\neager crowd into the hours of this single morning, made Adam look back\r\non all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence,\r\nand he had only now awaked to full consciousness. It seemed to him as\r\nif he had always before thought it a light thing that men should\r\nsuffer, as if all that he had himself endured and called sorrow before\r\nwas only a moment\xe2\x80\x99s stroke that had never left a bruise. Doubtless a\r\ngreat anguish may do the work of years, and we may come out from that\r\nbaptism of fire with a soul full of new awe and new pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam groaned, as he leaned on the table and looked blankly at\r\nthe face of the watch, \xe2\x80\x9cand men have suffered like this before... and\r\npoor helpless young things have suffered like her.... Such a little\r\nwhile ago looking so happy and so pretty... kissing \xe2\x80\x99em all, her\r\ngrandfather and all of \xe2\x80\x99em, and they wishing her luck.... O my poor,\r\npoor Hetty... dost think on it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam started and looked round towards the door. Vixen had begun to\r\nwhimper, and there was a sound of a stick and a lame walk on the\r\nstairs. It was Bartle Massey come back. Could it be all over?\r\n\r\nBartle entered quietly, and, going up to Adam, grasped his hand and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just come to look at you, my boy, for the folks are gone out\r\nof court for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat so violently he was unable to speak\xe2\x80\x94he could only\r\nreturn the pressure of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand\xe2\x80\x94and Bartle, drawing up the\r\nother chair, came and sat in front of him, taking off his hat and his\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing never happened to me before,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cto go out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the door with my spectacles on. I clean forgot to take \xe2\x80\x99em off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man made this trivial remark, thinking it better not to respond\r\nat all to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s agitation: he would gather, in an indirect way, that\r\nthere was nothing decisive to communicate at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising again, \xe2\x80\x9cI must see to your having a bit of\r\nthe loaf, and some of that wine Mr. Irwine sent this morning. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nangry with me if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it. Come, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, bringing\r\nforward the bottle and the loaf and pouring some wine into a cup, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust have a bit and a sup myself. Drink a drop with me, my lad\xe2\x80\x94drink\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam pushed the cup gently away and said, entreatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about\r\nit, Mr. Massey\xe2\x80\x94tell me all about it. Was she there? Have they begun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy, yes\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s taken all the time since I first went; but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re slow, they\xe2\x80\x99re slow; and there\xe2\x80\x99s the counsel they\xe2\x80\x99ve got for her\r\nputs a spoke in the wheel whenever he can, and makes a deal to do with\r\ncross-examining the witnesses and quarrelling with the other lawyers.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all he can do for the money they give him; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big\r\nsum\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a big sum. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x99cute fellow, with an eye that \xe2\x80\x99ud pick\r\nthe needles out of the hay in no time. If a man had got no feelings, it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be as good as a demonstration to listen to what goes on in court;\r\nbut a tender heart makes one stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99d have given up figures for ever\r\nonly to have had some good news to bring to you, my poor lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does it seem to be going against her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve said. I must know it now\xe2\x80\x94I must know what they have to bring\r\nagainst her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the chief evidence yet has been the doctors; all but Martin\r\nPoyser\xe2\x80\x94poor Martin. Everybody in court felt for him\xe2\x80\x94it was like one\r\nsob, the sound they made when he came down again. The worst was when\r\nthey told him to look at the prisoner at the bar. It was hard work,\r\npoor fellow\xe2\x80\x94it was hard work. Adam, my boy, the blow falls heavily on\r\nhim as well as you; you must help poor Martin; you must show courage.\r\nDrink some wine now, and show me you mean to bear it like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartle had made the right sort of appeal. Adam, with an air of quiet\r\nobedience, took up the cup and drank a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me how _she_ looked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrightened, very frightened, when they first brought her in; it was\r\nthe first sight of the crowd and the judge, poor creatur. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlot o\xe2\x80\x99 foolish women in fine clothes, with gewgaws all up their arms\r\nand feathers on their heads, sitting near the judge: they\xe2\x80\x99ve dressed\r\nthemselves out in that way, one \xe2\x80\x99ud think, to be scarecrows and\r\nwarnings against any man ever meddling with a woman again. They put up\r\ntheir glasses, and stared and whispered. But after that she stood like\r\na white image, staring down at her hands and seeming neither to hear\r\nnor see anything. And she\xe2\x80\x99s as white as a sheet. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak when\r\nthey asked her if she\xe2\x80\x99d plead \xe2\x80\x98guilty\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98not guilty,\xe2\x80\x99 and they\r\npleaded \xe2\x80\x98not guilty\xe2\x80\x99 for her. But when she heard her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nthere seemed to go a shiver right through her; and when they told him\r\nto look at her, she hung her head down, and cowered, and hid her face\r\nin her hands. He\xe2\x80\x99d much ado to speak poor man, his voice trembled so.\r\nAnd the counsellors\xe2\x80\x94who look as hard as nails mostly\xe2\x80\x94I saw, spared him\r\nas much as they could. Mr. Irwine put himself near him and went with\r\nhim out o\xe2\x80\x99 court. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing in a man\xe2\x80\x99s life to be able to\r\nstand by a neighbour and uphold him in such trouble as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless him, and you too, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, in a low voice,\r\nlaying his hand on Bartle\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, he\xe2\x80\x99s good metal; he gives the right ring when you try him,\r\nour parson does. A man o\xe2\x80\x99 sense\xe2\x80\x94says no more than\xe2\x80\x99s needful. He\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\none of those that think they can comfort you with chattering, as if\r\nfolks who stand by and look on knew a deal better what the trouble was\r\nthan those who have to bear it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do with such folks in my\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94in the south, when I was in trouble myself. Mr. Irwine is to be a\r\nwitness himself, by and by, on her side, you know, to speak to her\r\ncharacter and bringing up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the other evidence... does it go hard against her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Mr. Massey? Tell me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lad, yes. The truth is the best thing to tell. It must come at\r\nlast. The doctors\xe2\x80\x99 evidence is heavy on her\xe2\x80\x94is heavy. But she\xe2\x80\x99s gone on\r\ndenying she\xe2\x80\x99s had a child from first to last. These poor silly\r\nwomen-things\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve not the sense to know it\xe2\x80\x99s no use denying what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproved. It\xe2\x80\x99ll make against her with the jury, I doubt, her being so\r\nobstinate: they may be less for recommending her to mercy, if the\r\nverdict\xe2\x80\x99s against her. But Mr. Irwine \xe2\x80\x99ull leave no stone unturned with\r\nthe judge\xe2\x80\x94you may rely upon that, Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nobody to stand by her and seem to care for her in the\r\ncourt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the chaplain o\xe2\x80\x99 the jail sits near her, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a sharp\r\nferrety-faced man\xe2\x80\x94another sort o\xe2\x80\x99 flesh and blood to Mr. Irwine. They\r\nsay the jail chaplains are mostly the fag-end o\xe2\x80\x99 the clergy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one man as ought to be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam bitterly. Presently\r\nhe drew himself up and looked fixedly out of the window, apparently\r\nturning over some new idea in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, pushing the hair off his forehead, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo back with you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go into court. It\xe2\x80\x99s cowardly of me to keep away.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by her\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll own her\xe2\x80\x94for all she\xe2\x80\x99s been deceitful. They\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to cast her off\xe2\x80\x94her own flesh and blood. We hand folks over to\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, and show none ourselves. I used to be hard sometimes: I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever be hard again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, Mr. Massey\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a decision in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s manner which would have prevented Bartle\r\nfrom opposing him, even if he had wished to do so. He only said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\na bit, then, and another sup, Adam, for the love of me. See, I must\r\nstop and eat a morsel. Now, you take some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNerved by an active resolution, Adam took a morsel of bread and drank\r\nsome wine. He was haggard and unshaven, as he had been yesterday, but\r\nhe stood upright again, and looked more like the Adam Bede of former\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII\r\nThe Verdict\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old\r\nhall, now destroyed by fire. The midday light that fell on the close\r\npavement of human heads was shed through a line of high pointed\r\nwindows, variegated with the mellow tints of old painted glass. Grim\r\ndusty armour hung in high relief in front of the dark oaken gallery at\r\nthe farther end, and under the broad arch of the great mullioned window\r\nopposite was spread a curtain of old tapestry, covered with dim\r\nmelancholy figures, like a dozing indistinct dream of the past. It was\r\na place that through the rest of the year was haunted with the shadowy\r\nmemories of old kings and queens, unhappy, discrowned, imprisoned; but\r\nto-day all those shadows had fled, and not a soul in the vast hall felt\r\nthe presence of any but a living sorrow, which was quivering in warm\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nBut that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto, now\r\nwhen Adam Bede\xe2\x80\x99s tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the\r\nside of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s dock. In the broad sunlight of the great hall,\r\namong the sleek shaven faces of other men, the marks of suffering in\r\nhis face were startling even to Mr. Irwine, who had last seen him in\r\nthe dim light of his small room; and the neighbours from Hayslope who\r\nwere present, and who told Hetty Sorrel\xe2\x80\x99s story by their firesides in\r\ntheir old age, never forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede,\r\npoor fellow, taller by the head than most of the people round him, came\r\ninto court and took his place by her side.\r\n\r\nBut Hetty did not see him. She was standing in the same position Bartle\r\nMassey had described, her hands crossed over each other and her eyes\r\nfixed on them. Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments,\r\nbut at last, when the attention of the court was withdrawn by the\r\nproceedings he turned his face towards her with a resolution not to\r\nshrink.\r\n\r\nWhy did they say she was so changed? In the corpse we love, it is the\r\n_likeness_ we see\xe2\x80\x94it is the likeness, which makes itself felt the more\r\nkeenly because something else _was_ and _is not_. There they were\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsweet face and neck, with the dark tendrils of hair, the long dark\r\nlashes, the rounded cheek and the pouting lips\xe2\x80\x94pale and thin, yes, but\r\nlike Hetty, and only Hetty. Others thought she looked as if some demon\r\nhad cast a blighting glance upon her, withered up the woman\xe2\x80\x99s soul in\r\nher, and left only a hard despairing obstinacy. But the mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyearning, that completest type of the life in another life which is the\r\nessence of real human love, feels the presence of the cherished child\r\neven in the debased, degraded man; and to Adam, this pale, hard-looking\r\nculprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under the\r\napple-tree boughs\xe2\x80\x94she was that Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s corpse, which he had trembled to\r\nlook at the first time, and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nBut presently he heard something that compelled him to listen, and made\r\nthe sense of sight less absorbing. A woman was in the witness-box, a\r\nmiddle-aged woman, who spoke in a firm distinct voice. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nname is Sarah Stone. I am a widow, and keep a small shop licensed to\r\nsell tobacco, snuff, and tea in Church Lane, Stoniton. The prisoner at\r\nthe bar is the same young woman who came, looking ill and tired, with a\r\nbasket on her arm, and asked for a lodging at my house on Saturday\r\nevening, the 27th of February. She had taken the house for a public,\r\nbecause there was a figure against the door. And when I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake in lodgers, the prisoner began to cry, and said she was too tired\r\nto go anywhere else, and she only wanted a bed for one night. And her\r\nprettiness, and her condition, and something respectable about her\r\nclothes and looks, and the trouble she seemed to be in made me as I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find in my heart to send her away at once. I asked her to sit\r\ndown, and gave her some tea, and asked her where she was going, and\r\nwhere her friends were. She said she was going home to her friends:\r\nthey were farming folks a good way off, and she\xe2\x80\x99d had a long journey\r\nthat had cost her more money than she expected, so as she\xe2\x80\x99d hardly any\r\nmoney left in her pocket, and was afraid of going where it would cost\r\nher much. She had been obliged to sell most of the things out of her\r\nbasket, but she\xe2\x80\x99d thankfully give a shilling for a bed. I saw no reason\r\nwhy I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the young woman in for the night. I had only one\r\nroom, but there were two beds in it, and I told her she might stay with\r\nme. I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d been led wrong, and got into trouble, but if she\r\nwas going to her friends, it would be a good work to keep her out of\r\nfurther harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witness then stated that in the night a child was born, and she\r\nidentified the baby-clothes then shown to her as those in which she had\r\nherself dressed the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the clothes. I made them myself, and had kept them by me\r\never since my last child was born. I took a deal of trouble both for\r\nthe child and the mother. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help taking to the little thing\r\nand being anxious about it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t send for a doctor, for there\r\nseemed no need. I told the mother in the day-time she must tell me the\r\nname of her friends, and where they lived, and let me write to them.\r\nShe said, by and by she would write herself, but not to-day. She would\r\nhave no nay, but she would get up and be dressed, in spite of\r\neverything I could say. She said she felt quite strong enough; and it\r\nwas wonderful what spirit she showed. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite easy what I\r\nshould do about her, and towards evening I made up my mind I\xe2\x80\x99d go,\r\nafter Meeting was over, and speak to our minister about it. I left the\r\nhouse about half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out at the shop door,\r\nbut at the back door, which opens into a narrow alley. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got\r\nthe ground-floor of the house, and the kitchen and bedroom both look\r\ninto the alley. I left the prisoner sitting up by the fire in the\r\nkitchen with the baby on her lap. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cried or seemed low at\r\nall, as she did the night before. I thought she had a strange look with\r\nher eyes, and she got a bit flushed towards evening. I was afraid of\r\nthe fever, and I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d call and ask an acquaintance of mine, an\r\nexperienced woman, to come back with me when I went out. It was a very\r\ndark night. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fasten the door behind me; there was no lock; it\r\nwas a latch with a bolt inside, and when there was nobody in the house\r\nI always went out at the shop door. But I thought there was no danger\r\nin leaving it unfastened that little while. I was longer than I meant\r\nto be, for I had to wait for the woman that came back with me. It was\r\nan hour and a half before we got back, and when we went in, the candle\r\nwas standing burning just as I left it, but the prisoner and the baby\r\nwere both gone. She\xe2\x80\x99d taken her cloak and bonnet, but she\xe2\x80\x99d left the\r\nbasket and the things in it.... I was dreadful frightened, and angry\r\nwith her for going. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to give information, because I\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nthought she meant to do any harm, and I knew she had money in her\r\npocket to buy her food and lodging. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to set the constable\r\nafter her, for she\xe2\x80\x99d a right to go from me if she liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical; it gave him new\r\nforce. Hetty could not be guilty of the crime\xe2\x80\x94her heart must have clung\r\nto her baby\xe2\x80\x94else why should she have taken it with her? She might have\r\nleft it behind. The little creature had died naturally, and then she\r\nhad hidden it. Babies were so liable to death\xe2\x80\x94and there might be the\r\nstrongest suspicions without any proof of guilt. His mind was so\r\noccupied with imaginary arguments against such suspicions, that he\r\ncould not listen to the cross-examination by Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, who\r\ntried, without result, to elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown\r\nsome movements of maternal affection towards the child. The whole time\r\nthis witness was being examined, Hetty had stood as motionless as\r\nbefore: no word seemed to arrest her ear. But the sound of the next\r\nwitness\xe2\x80\x99s voice touched a chord that was still sensitive, she gave a\r\nstart and a frightened look towards him, but immediately turned away\r\nher head and looked down at her hands as before. This witness was a\r\nman, a rough peasant. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is John Olding. I am a labourer, and live at Tedd\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, two\r\nmiles out of Stoniton. A week last Monday, towards one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon, I was going towards Hetton Coppice, and about a quarter of a\r\nmile from the coppice I saw the prisoner, in a red cloak, sitting under\r\na bit of a haystack not far off the stile. She got up when she saw me,\r\nand seemed as if she\xe2\x80\x99d be walking on the other way. It was a regular\r\nroad through the fields, and nothing very uncommon to see a young woman\r\nthere, but I took notice of her because she looked white and scared. I\r\nshould have thought she was a beggar-woman, only for her good clothes.\r\nI thought she looked a bit crazy, but it was no business of mine. I\r\nstood and looked back after her, but she went right on while she was in\r\nsight. I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some\r\nstakes. There\xe2\x80\x99s a road right through it, and bits of openings here and\r\nthere, where the trees have been cut down, and some of \xe2\x80\x99em not carried\r\naway. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go straight along the road, but turned off towards the\r\nmiddle, and took a shorter way towards the spot I wanted to get to. I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t got far out of the road into one of the open places before I\r\nheard a strange cry. I thought it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come from any animal I knew,\r\nbut I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for stopping to look about just then. But it went on, and\r\nseemed so strange to me in that place, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help stopping to\r\nlook. I began to think I might make some money of it, if it was a new\r\nthing. But I had hard work to tell which way it came from, and for a\r\ngood while I kept looking up at the boughs. And then I thought it came\r\nfrom the ground; and there was a lot of timber-choppings lying about,\r\nand loose pieces of turf, and a trunk or two. And I looked about among\r\nthem, but could find nothing, and at last the cry stopped. So I was for\r\ngiving it up, and I went on about my business. But when I came back the\r\nsame way pretty nigh an hour after, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help laying down my\r\nstakes to have another look. And just as I was stooping and laying down\r\nthe stakes, I saw something odd and round and whitish lying on the\r\nground under a nut-bush by the side of me. And I stooped down on hands\r\nand knees to pick it up. And I saw it was a little baby\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words a thrill ran through the court. Hetty was visibly\r\ntrembling; now, for the first time, she seemed to be listening to what\r\na witness said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a lot of timber-choppings put together just where the ground\r\nwent hollow, like, under the bush, and the hand came out from among\r\nthem. But there was a hole left in one place and I could see down it\r\nand see the child\xe2\x80\x99s head; and I made haste and did away the turf and\r\nthe choppings, and took out the child. It had got comfortable clothes\r\non, but its body was cold, and I thought it must be dead. I made haste\r\nback with it out of the wood, and took it home to my wife. She said it\r\nwas dead, and I\xe2\x80\x99d better take it to the parish and tell the constable.\r\nAnd I said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay my life it\xe2\x80\x99s that young woman\xe2\x80\x99s child as I met\r\ngoing to the coppice.\xe2\x80\x99 But she seemed to be gone clean out of sight.\r\nAnd I took the child on to Hetton parish and told the constable, and we\r\nwent on to Justice Hardy. And then we went looking after the young\r\nwoman till dark at night, and we went and gave information at Stoniton,\r\nas they might stop her. And the next morning, another constable came to\r\nme, to go with him to the spot where I found the child. And when we got\r\nthere, there was the prisoner a-sitting against the bush where I found\r\nthe child; and she cried out when she saw us, but she never offered to\r\nmove. She\xe2\x80\x99d got a big piece of bread on her lap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was\r\nspeaking. He had hidden his face on his arm, which rested on the\r\nboarding in front of him. It was the supreme moment of his suffering:\r\nHetty was guilty; and he was silently calling to God for help. He heard\r\nno more of the evidence, and was unconscious when the case for the\r\nprosecution had closed\xe2\x80\x94unconscious that Mr. Irwine was in the\r\nwitness-box, telling of Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s unblemished character in her own parish\r\nand of the virtuous habits in which she had been brought up. This\r\ntestimony could have no influence on the verdict, but it was given as\r\npart of that plea for mercy which her own counsel would have made if he\r\nhad been allowed to speak for her\xe2\x80\x94a favour not granted to criminals in\r\nthose stern times.\r\n\r\nAt last Adam lifted up his head, for there was a general movement round\r\nhim. The judge had addressed the jury, and they were retiring. The\r\ndecisive moment was not far off. Adam felt a shuddering horror that\r\nwould not let him look at Hetty, but she had long relapsed into her\r\nblank hard indifference. All eyes were strained to look at her, but she\r\nstood like a statue of dull despair.\r\n\r\nThere was a mingled rustling, whispering, and low buzzing throughout\r\nthe court during this interval. The desire to listen was suspended, and\r\nevery one had some feeling or opinion to express in undertones. Adam\r\nsat looking blankly before him, but he did not see the objects that\r\nwere right in front of his eyes\xe2\x80\x94the counsel and attorneys talking with\r\nan air of cool business, and Mr. Irwine in low earnest conversation\r\nwith the judge\xe2\x80\x94did not see Mr. Irwine sit down again in agitation and\r\nshake his head mournfully when somebody whispered to him. The inward\r\naction was too intense for Adam to take in outward objects until some\r\nstrong sensation roused him.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long, hardly more than a quarter of an hour, before the\r\nknock which told that the jury had come to their decision fell as a\r\nsignal for silence on every ear. It is sublime\xe2\x80\x94that sudden pause of a\r\ngreat multitude which tells that one soul moves in them all. Deeper and\r\ndeeper the silence seemed to become, like the deepening night, while\r\nthe jurymen\xe2\x80\x99s names were called over, and the prisoner was made to hold\r\nup her hand, and the jury were asked for their verdict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the verdict every one expected, but there was a sigh of\r\ndisappointment from some hearts that it was followed by no\r\nrecommendation to mercy. Still the sympathy of the court was not with\r\nthe prisoner. The unnaturalness of her crime stood out the more harshly\r\nby the side of her hard immovability and obstinate silence. Even the\r\nverdict, to distant eyes, had not appeared to move her, but those who\r\nwere near saw her trembling.\r\n\r\nThe stillness was less intense until the judge put on his black cap,\r\nand the chaplain in his canonicals was observed behind him. Then it\r\ndeepened again, before the crier had had time to command silence. If\r\nany sound were heard, it must have been the sound of beating hearts.\r\nThe judge spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cHester Sorrel....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then fled back again as she\r\nlooked up at the judge and kept her wide-open eyes fixed on him, as if\r\nfascinated by fear. Adam had not yet turned towards her, there was a\r\ndeep horror, like a great gulf, between them. But at the words \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen to be hanged by the neck till you be dead,\xe2\x80\x9d a piercing shriek rang\r\nthrough the hall. It was Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s shriek. Adam started to his feet and\r\nstretched out his arms towards her. But the arms could not reach her:\r\nshe had fallen down in a fainting-fit, and was carried out of court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s Return\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read the letter from\r\nhis Aunt Lydia, briefly announcing his grand-father\xe2\x80\x99s death, his first\r\nfeeling was, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Grandfather! I wish I could have got to him to be\r\nwith him when he died. He might have felt or wished something at the\r\nlast that I shall never know now. It was a lonely death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say that his grief was deeper than that. Pity and\r\nsoftened memory took place of the old antagonism, and in his busy\r\nthoughts about the future, as the chaise carried him rapidly along\r\ntowards the home where he was now to be master, there was a continually\r\nrecurring effort to remember anything by which he could show a regard\r\nfor his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, without counteracting his own cherished\r\naims for the good of the tenants and the estate. But it is not in human\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94only in human pretence\xe2\x80\x94for a young man like Arthur, with a fine\r\nconstitution and fine spirits, thinking well of himself, believing that\r\nothers think well of him, and having a very ardent intention to give\r\nthem more and more reason for that good opinion\xe2\x80\x94it is not possible for\r\nsuch a young man, just coming into a splendid estate through the death\r\nof a very old man whom he was not fond of, to feel anything very\r\ndifferent from exultant joy. _Now_ his real life was beginning; now he\r\nwould have room and opportunity for action, and he would use them. He\r\nwould show the Loamshire people what a fine country gentleman was; he\r\nwould not exchange that career for any other under the sun. He felt\r\nhimself riding over the hills in the breezy autumn days, looking after\r\nfavourite plans of drainage and enclosure; then admired on sombre\r\nmornings as the best rider on the best horse in the hunt; spoken well\r\nof on market-days as a first-rate landlord; by and by making speeches\r\nat election dinners, and showing a wonderful knowledge of agriculture;\r\nthe patron of new ploughs and drills, the severe upbraider of negligent\r\nlandowners, and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must like\xe2\x80\x94happy\r\nfaces greeting him everywhere on his own estate, and the neighbouring\r\nfamilies on the best terms with him. The Irwines should dine with him\r\nevery week, and have their own carriage to come in, for in some very\r\ndelicate way that Arthur would devise, the lay-impropriator of the\r\nHayslope tithes would insist on paying a couple of hundreds more to the\r\nvicar; and his aunt should be as comfortable as possible, and go on\r\nliving at the Chase, if she liked, in spite of her old-maidish ways\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast until he was married, and that event lay in the indistinct\r\nbackground, for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play the\r\nlady-wife to the first-rate country gentleman.\r\n\r\nThese were Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s chief thoughts, so far as a man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts through\r\nhours of travelling can be compressed into a few sentences, which are\r\nonly like the list of names telling you what are the scenes in a long\r\nlong panorama full of colour, of detail, and of life. The happy faces\r\nArthur saw greeting him were not pale abstractions, but real ruddy\r\nfaces, long familiar to him: Martin Poyser was there\xe2\x80\x94the whole Poyser\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x94Hetty?\r\n\r\nYes; for Arthur was at ease about Hetty\xe2\x80\x94not quite at ease about the\r\npast, for a certain burning of the ears would come whenever he thought\r\nof the scenes with Adam last August, but at ease about her present lot.\r\nMr. Irwine, who had been a regular correspondent, telling him all the\r\nnews about the old places and people, had sent him word nearly three\r\nmonths ago that Adam Bede was not to marry Mary Burge, as he had\r\nthought, but pretty Hetty Sorrel. Martin Poyser and Adam himself had\r\nboth told Mr. Irwine all about it\xe2\x80\x94that Adam had been deeply in love\r\nwith Hetty these two years, and that now it was agreed they were to be\r\nmarried in March. That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than\r\nthe rector had thought; it was really quite an idyllic love affair; and\r\nif it had not been too long to tell in a letter, he would have liked to\r\ndescribe to Arthur the blushing looks and the simple strong words with\r\nwhich the fine honest fellow told his secret. He knew Arthur would like\r\nto hear that Adam had this sort of happiness in prospect.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed! Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to\r\nsatisfy his renovated life, when he had read that passage in the\r\nletter. He threw up the windows, he rushed out of doors into the\r\nDecember air, and greeted every one who spoke to him with an eager\r\ngaiety, as if there had been news of a fresh Nelson victory. For the\r\nfirst time that day since he had come to Windsor, he was in true boyish\r\nspirits. The load that had been pressing upon him was gone, the\r\nhaunting fear had vanished. He thought he could conquer his bitterness\r\ntowards Adam now\xe2\x80\x94could offer him his hand, and ask to be his friend\r\nagain, in spite of that painful memory which would still make his ears\r\nburn. He had been knocked down, and he had been forced to tell a lie:\r\nsuch things make a scar, do what we will. But if Adam were the same\r\nagain as in the old days, Arthur wished to be the same too, and to have\r\nAdam mixed up with his business and his future, as he had always\r\ndesired before the accursed meeting in August. Nay, he would do a great\r\ndeal more for Adam than he should otherwise have done, when he came\r\ninto the estate; Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s husband had a special claim on him\xe2\x80\x94Hetty\r\nherself should feel that any pain she had suffered through Arthur in\r\nthe past was compensated to her a hundredfold. For really she could not\r\nhave felt much, since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam.\r\n\r\nYou perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made in the\r\npanorama of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on his journey homeward. It was March\r\nnow; they were soon to be married: perhaps they were already married.\r\nAnd _now_ it was actually in his power to do a great deal for them.\r\nSweet\xe2\x80\x94sweet little Hetty! The little puss hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cared for him half as\r\nmuch as he cared for her; for he was a great fool about her still\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nalmost afraid of seeing her\xe2\x80\x94indeed, had not cared much to look at any\r\nother woman since he parted from her. That little figure coming towards\r\nhim in the Grove, those dark-fringed childish eyes, the lovely lips put\r\nup to kiss him\xe2\x80\x94that picture had got no fainter with the lapse of\r\nmonths. And she would look just the same. It was impossible to think\r\nhow he could meet her: he should certainly tremble. Strange, how long\r\nthis sort of influence lasts, for he was certainly not in love with\r\nHetty now. He had been earnestly desiring, for months, that she should\r\nmarry Adam, and there was nothing that contributed more to his\r\nhappiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage. It was\r\nthe exaggerating effect of imagination that made his heart still beat a\r\nlittle more quickly at the thought of her. When he saw the little thing\r\nagain as she really was, as Adam\xe2\x80\x99s wife, at work quite prosaically in\r\nher new home, he should perhaps wonder at the possibility of his past\r\nfeelings. Thank heaven it had turned out so well! He should have plenty\r\nof affairs and interests to fill his life now, and not be in danger of\r\nplaying the fool again.\r\n\r\nPleasant the crack of the post-boy\xe2\x80\x99s whip! Pleasant the sense of being\r\nhurried along in swift ease through English scenes, so like those round\r\nhis own home, only not quite so charming. Here was a market-town\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nmuch like Treddleston\xe2\x80\x94where the arms of the neighbouring lord of the\r\nmanor were borne on the sign of the principal inn; then mere fields and\r\nhedges, their vicinity to a market-town carrying an agreeable\r\nsuggestion of high rent, till the land began to assume a trimmer look,\r\nthe woods were more frequent, and at length a white or red mansion\r\nlooked down from a moderate eminence, or allowed him to be aware of its\r\nparapet and chimneys among the dense-looking masses of oaks and\r\nelms\xe2\x80\x94masses reddened now with early buds. And close at hand came the\r\nvillage: the small church, with its red-tiled roof, looking humble even\r\namong the faded half-timbered houses; the old green gravestones with\r\nnettles round them; nothing fresh and bright but the children, opening\r\nround eyes at the swift post-chaise; nothing noisy and busy but the\r\ngaping curs of mysterious pedigree. What a much prettier village\r\nHayslope was! And it should not be neglected like this place: vigorous\r\nrepairs should go on everywhere among farm-buildings and cottages, and\r\ntravellers in post-chaises, coming along the Rosseter road, should do\r\nnothing but admire as they went. And Adam Bede should superintend all\r\nthe repairs, for he had a share in Burge\xe2\x80\x99s business now, and, if he\r\nliked, Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the old man\r\nout in another year or two. That was an ugly fault in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nthat affair last summer, but the future should make amends. Many men\r\nwould have retained a feeling of vindictiveness towards Adam, but _he_\r\nwould not\xe2\x80\x94he would resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind, for\r\nhe had certainly been very much in the wrong; and though Adam had been\r\nharsh and violent, and had thrust on him a painful dilemma, the poor\r\nfellow was in love, and had real provocation. No, Arthur had not an\r\nevil feeling in his mind towards any human being: he was happy, and\r\nwould make every one else happy that came within his reach.\r\n\r\nAnd here was dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a\r\nquiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight, and opposite\r\nto it the great shoulders of the Binton Hills, below them the purplish\r\nblackness of the hanging woods, and at last the pale front of the\r\nAbbey, looking out from among the oaks of the Chase, as if anxious for\r\nthe heir\xe2\x80\x99s return. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Grandfather! And he lies dead there. _He_ was\r\na young fellow once, coming into the estate and making his plans. So\r\nthe world goes round! Aunt Lydia must feel very desolate, poor thing;\r\nbut she shall be indulged as much as she indulges her fat Fido.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wheels of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s chaise had been anxiously listened for at the\r\nChase, for to-day was Friday, and the funeral had already been deferred\r\ntwo days. Before it drew up on the gravel of the courtyard, all the\r\nservants in the house were assembled to receive him with a grave,\r\ndecent welcome, befitting a house of death. A month ago, perhaps, it\r\nwould have been difficult for them to have maintained a suitable\r\nsadness in their faces, when Mr. Arthur was come to take possession;\r\nbut the hearts of the head-servants were heavy that day for another\r\ncause than the death of the old squire, and more than one of them was\r\nlonging to be twenty miles away, as Mr. Craig was, knowing what was to\r\nbecome of Hetty Sorrel\xe2\x80\x94pretty Hetty Sorrel\xe2\x80\x94whom they used to see every\r\nweek. They had the partisanship of household servants who like their\r\nplaces, and were not inclined to go the full length of the severe\r\nindignation felt against him by the farming tenants, but rather to make\r\nexcuses for him; nevertheless, the upper servants, who had been on\r\nterms of neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many years, could\r\nnot help feeling that the longed-for event of the young squire\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\ninto the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness.\r\n\r\nTo Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and\r\nsad: he himself was very much touched on seeing them all again, and\r\nfeeling that he was in a new relation to them. It was that sort of\r\npathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in it\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\nperhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a good-natured man,\r\nconscious of the power to satisfy his good nature. His heart swelled\r\nagreeably as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mills, how is my aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now Mr. Bygate, the lawyer, who had been in the house ever since\r\nthe death, came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all\r\nquestions, and Arthur walked with him towards the library, where his\r\nAunt Lydia was expecting him. Aunt Lydia was the only person in the\r\nhouse who knew nothing about Hetty. Her sorrow as a maiden daughter was\r\nunmixed with any other thoughts than those of anxiety about funeral\r\narrangements and her own future lot; and, after the manner of women,\r\nshe mourned for the father who had made her life important, all the\r\nmore because she had a secret sense that there was little mourning for\r\nhim in other hearts.\r\n\r\nBut Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done\r\nin his life before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said affectionately, as he held her hand, \xe2\x80\x9c_your_ loss\r\nis the greatest of all, but you must tell me how to try and make it up\r\nto you all the rest of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so sudden and so dreadful, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d poor Miss Lydia began,\r\npouring out her little plaints, and Arthur sat down to listen with\r\nimpatient patience. When a pause came, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Aunt, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you for a quarter of an hour just to go to my\r\nown room, and then I shall come and give full attention to everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy room is all ready for me, I suppose, Mills?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the butler,\r\nwho seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrance-hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and there are letters for you; they are all laid on the\r\nwriting-table in your dressing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn entering the small anteroom which was called a dressing-room, but\r\nwhich Arthur really used only to lounge and write in, he just cast his\r\neyes on the writing-table, and saw that there were several letters and\r\npackets lying there; but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of\r\na man who has had a long hurried journey, and he must really refresh\r\nhimself by attending to his toilette a little, before he read his\r\nletters. Pym was there, making everything ready for him, and soon, with\r\na delightful freshness about him, as if he were prepared to begin a new\r\nday, he went back into his dressing-room to open his letters. The level\r\nrays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window, and as\r\nArthur seated himself in his velvet chair with their pleasant warmth\r\nupon him, he was conscious of that quiet well-being which perhaps you\r\nand I have felt on a sunny afternoon when, in our brightest youth and\r\nhealth, life has opened a new vista for us, and long to-morrows of\r\nactivity have stretched before us like a lovely plain which there was\r\nno need for hurrying to look at, because it was all our own.\r\n\r\nThe top letter was placed with its address upwards: it was in Mr.\r\nIrwine\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, Arthur saw at once; and below the address was\r\nwritten, \xe2\x80\x9cTo be delivered as soon as he arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing could have\r\nbeen less surprising to him than a letter from Mr. Irwine at that\r\nmoment: of course, there was something he wished Arthur to know earlier\r\nthan it was possible for them to see each other. At such a time as that\r\nit was quite natural that Irwine should have something pressing to say.\r\nArthur broke the seal with an agreeable anticipation of soon seeing the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI send this letter to meet you on your arrival, Arthur, because I may\r\nthen be at Stoniton, whither I am called by the most painful duty it\r\nhas ever been given me to perform, and it is right that you should know\r\nwhat I have to tell you without delay.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the\r\n    retribution that is now falling on you: any other words that I\r\n    could write at this moment must be weak and unmeaning by the side\r\n    of those in which I must tell you the simple fact.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHetty Sorrel is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the\r\n    crime of child-murder.\xe2\x80\x9d..._\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur read no more. He started up from his chair and stood for a\r\nsingle minute with a sense of violent convulsion in his whole frame, as\r\nif the life were going out of him with horrible throbs; but the next\r\nminute he had rushed out of the room, still clutching the letter\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nhurrying along the corridor, and down the stairs into the hall. Mills\r\nwas still there, but Arthur did not see him, as he passed like a hunted\r\nman across the hall and out along the gravel. The butler hurried out\r\nafter him as fast as his elderly limbs could run: he guessed, he knew,\r\nwhere the young squire was going.\r\n\r\nWhen Mills got to the stables, a horse was being saddled, and Arthur\r\nwas forcing himself to read the remaining words of the letter. He\r\nthrust it into his pocket as the horse was led up to him, and at that\r\nmoment caught sight of Mills\xe2\x80\x99 anxious face in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them I\xe2\x80\x99m gone\xe2\x80\x94gone to Stoniton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a muffled tone of\r\nagitation\xe2\x80\x94sprang into the saddle, and set off at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV\r\nIn the Prison\r\n\r\n\r\nNear sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was standing with his\r\nback against the smaller entrance-door of Stoniton jail, saying a few\r\nlast words to the departing chaplain. The chaplain walked away, but the\r\nelderly gentleman stood still, looking down on the pavement and\r\nstroking his chin with a ruminating air, when he was roused by a sweet\r\nclear woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I get into the prison, if you\r\nplease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few moments\r\nwithout answering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember preaching\r\non the village green at Hayslope in Loamshire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, surely. Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on\r\nhorseback?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Why do you want to go into the prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to Hetty Sorrel, the young woman who has been condemned\r\nto death\xe2\x80\x94and to stay with her, if I may be permitted. Have you power in\r\nthe prison, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am a magistrate, and can get admittance for you. But did you\r\nknow this criminal, Hetty Sorrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are kin. My own aunt married her uncle, Martin Poyser. But I\r\nwas away at Leeds, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know of this great trouble in time to get\r\nhere before to-day. I entreat you, sir, for the love of our heavenly\r\nFather, to let me go to her and stay with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know she was condemned to death, if you are only just come\r\nfrom Leeds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen my uncle since the trial, sir. He is gone back to his home\r\nnow, and the poor sinner is forsaken of all. I beseech you to get leave\r\nfor me to be with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Have you courage to stay all night in the prison? She is very\r\nsullen, and will scarcely make answer when she is spoken to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, it may please God to open her heart still. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us\r\ndelay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elderly gentleman, ringing and gaining\r\nadmission, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have a key to unlock hearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were\r\nwithin the prison court, from the habit she had of throwing them off\r\nwhen she preached or prayed, or visited the sick; and when they entered\r\nthe jailer\xe2\x80\x99s room, she laid them down on a chair unthinkingly. There\r\nwas no agitation visible in her, but a deep concentrated calmness, as\r\nif, even when she was speaking, her soul was in prayer reposing on an\r\nunseen support.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to the jailer, the magistrate turned to her and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe turnkey will take you to the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s cell and leave you there\r\nfor the night, if you desire it, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t have a light during the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94it is contrary to rules. My name is Colonel Townley: if I can\r\nhelp you in anything, ask the jailer for my address and come to me. I\r\ntake some interest in this Hetty Sorrel, for the sake of that fine\r\nfellow, Adam Bede. I happened to see him at Hayslope the same evening I\r\nheard you preach, and recognized him in court to-day, ill as he\r\nlooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir, can you tell me anything about him? Can you tell me where he\r\nlodges? For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose by here. I inquired all about him of Mr. Irwine. He lodges over\r\na tinman\xe2\x80\x99s shop, in the street on the right hand as you entered the\r\nprison. There is an old school-master with him. Now, good-bye: I wish\r\nyou success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, sir. I am grateful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn evening\r\nlight seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day, and the\r\nsweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on\r\nthis background of gloom. The turnkey looked askance at her all the\r\nwhile, but never spoke. He somehow felt that the sound of his own rude\r\nvoice would be grating just then. He struck a light as they entered the\r\ndark corridor leading to the condemned cell, and then said in his most\r\ncivil tone, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty nigh dark in the cell a\xe2\x80\x99ready, but I can\r\nstop with my light a bit, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, friend, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to go in alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the jailer, turning the harsh key in the lock and\r\nopening the door wide enough to admit Dinah. A jet of light from his\r\nlantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell, where Hetty was\r\nsitting on her straw pallet with her face buried in her knees. It\r\nseemed as if she were asleep, and yet the grating of the lock would\r\nhave been likely to waken her.\r\n\r\nThe door closed again, and the only light in the cell was that of the\r\nevening sky, through the small high grating\xe2\x80\x94enough to discern human\r\nfaces by. Dinah stood still for a minute, hesitating to speak because\r\nHetty might be asleep, and looking at the motionless heap with a\r\nyearning heart. Then she said, softly, \xe2\x80\x9cHetty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight movement perceptible in Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s frame\xe2\x80\x94a start such\r\nas might have been produced by a feeble electrical shock\xe2\x80\x94but she did\r\nnot look up. Dinah spoke again, in a tone made stronger by\r\nirrepressible emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cHetty... it\xe2\x80\x99s Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was a slight startled movement through Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s frame, and\r\nwithout uncovering her face, she raised her head a little, as if\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty... Dinah is come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from\r\nher knees and raised her eyes. The two pale faces were looking at each\r\nother: one with a wild hard despair in it, the other full of sad\r\nyearning love. Dinah unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know me, Hetty? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember Dinah? Did you think I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to you in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94at first like an animal that\r\ngazes, and gazes, and keeps aloof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come to be with you, Hetty\xe2\x80\x94not to leave you\xe2\x80\x94to stay with you\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nyour sister to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly, while Dinah was speaking, Hetty rose, took a step forward, and\r\nwas clasped in Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nThey stood so a long while, for neither of them felt the impulse to\r\nmove apart again. Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung on\r\nthis something that was come to clasp her now, while she was sinking\r\nhelpless in a dark gulf; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign\r\nthat her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one. The light got\r\nfainter as they stood, and when at last they sat down on the straw\r\npallet together, their faces had become indistinct.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken. Dinah waited, hoping for a spontaneous word from\r\nHetty, but she sat in the same dull despair, only clutching the hand\r\nthat held hers and leaning her cheek against Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s. It was the human\r\ncontact she clung to, but she was not the less sinking into the dark\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\nDinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat\r\nbeside her. She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor\r\nsinner out of her mind. But it was borne in upon her, as she afterwards\r\nsaid, that she must not hurry God\xe2\x80\x99s work: we are overhasty to speak\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nif God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling, and make his\r\nlove felt through ours. She did not know how long they sat in that way,\r\nbut it got darker and darker, till there was only a pale patch of light\r\non the opposite wall: all the rest was darkness. But she felt the\r\nDivine presence more and more\xe2\x80\x94nay, as if she herself were a part of it,\r\nand it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was\r\nwilling the rescue of this helpless one. At last she was prompted to\r\nspeak and find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know who it is that sits by your\r\nside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty answered slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember the time when we were at the Hall Farm together,\r\nand that night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend\r\nin trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hetty. Then, after a pause, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can do\r\nnothing for me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make \xe2\x80\x99em do anything. They\xe2\x80\x99ll hang me o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMonday\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Hetty said the last words, she clung closer to Dinah, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Hetty, I can\xe2\x80\x99t save you from that death. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t the suffering\r\nless hard when you have somebody with you, that feels for you\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\ncan speak to, and say what\xe2\x80\x99s in your heart?... Yes, Hetty: you lean on\r\nme: you are glad to have me with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, Dinah? You\xe2\x80\x99ll keep close to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Hetty, I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with you to the last.... But,\r\nHetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one close\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty said, in a frightened whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and\r\ntrouble\xe2\x80\x94who has known every thought you have had\xe2\x80\x94has seen where you\r\nwent, where you lay down and rose up again, and all the deeds you have\r\ntried to hide in darkness. And on Monday, when I can\xe2\x80\x99t follow you\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nmy arms can\xe2\x80\x99t reach you\xe2\x80\x94when death has parted us\xe2\x80\x94He who is with us now,\r\nand knows all, will be with you then. It makes no difference\xe2\x80\x94whether we\r\nlive or die, we are in the presence of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dinah, won\xe2\x80\x99t nobody do anything for me? _Will_ they hang me for\r\ncertain?... I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if they\xe2\x80\x99d let me live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Hetty, death is very dreadful to you. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful.\r\nBut if you had a friend to take care of you after death\xe2\x80\x94in that other\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94some one whose love is greater than mine\xe2\x80\x94who can do\r\neverything?... If God our Father was your friend, and was willing to\r\nsave you from sin and suffering, so as you should neither know wicked\r\nfeelings nor pain again? If you could believe he loved you and would\r\nhelp you, as you believe I love you and will help you, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nso hard to die on Monday, would it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty said, with sullen sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, Hetty, you are shutting up your soul against him, by trying\r\nto hide the truth. God\xe2\x80\x99s love and mercy can overcome all things\xe2\x80\x94our\r\nignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our past wickedness\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthings but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to, and will not give up.\r\nYou believe in my love and pity for you, Hetty, but if you had not let\r\nme come near you, if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have looked at me or spoken to me,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have shut me out from helping you. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made you feel\r\nmy love; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told you what I felt for you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t shut God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove out in that way, by clinging to sin.... He can\xe2\x80\x99t bless you while\r\nyou have one falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy can\xe2\x80\x99t reach\r\nyou until you open your heart to him, and say, \xe2\x80\x98I have done this great\r\nwickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.\xe2\x80\x99 While you cling to\r\none sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to misery\r\nafter death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this world, my\r\npoor, poor Hetty. It is sin that brings dread, and darkness, and\r\ndespair: there is light and blessedness for us as soon as we cast it\r\noff. God enters our souls then, and teaches us, and brings us strength\r\nand peace. Cast it off now, Hetty\xe2\x80\x94now: confess the wickedness you have\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94the sin you have been guilty of against your Heavenly Father. Let\r\nus kneel down together, for we are in the presence of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty obeyed Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s movement, and sank on her knees. They still held\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and there was long silence. Then Dinah said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHetty, we are before God. He is waiting for you to tell the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of beseeching\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah... help me... I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything like you...my heart is\r\nhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah held the clinging hand, and all her soul went forth in her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus, thou present Saviour! Thou hast known the depths of all sorrow:\r\nthou hast entered that black darkness where God is not, and hast\r\nuttered the cry of the forsaken. Come Lord, and gather of the fruits of\r\nthy travail and thy pleading. Stretch forth thy hand, thou who art\r\nmighty to save to the uttermost, and rescue this lost one. She is\r\nclothed round with thick darkness. The fetters of her sin are upon her,\r\nand she cannot stir to come to thee. She can only feel her heart is\r\nhard, and she is helpless. She cries to me, thy weak creature....\r\nSaviour! It is a blind cry to thee. Hear it! Pierce the darkness! Look\r\nupon her with thy face of love and sorrow that thou didst turn on him\r\nwho denied thee, and melt her hard heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Lord, I bring her, as they of old brought the sick and helpless,\r\nand thou didst heal them. I bear her on my arms and carry her before\r\nthee. Fear and trembling have taken hold on her, but she trembles only\r\nat the pain and death of the body. Breathe upon her thy life-giving\r\nSpirit, and put a new fear within her\xe2\x80\x94the fear of her sin. Make her\r\ndread to keep the accursed thing within her soul. Make her feel the\r\npresence of the living God, who beholds all the past, to whom the\r\ndarkness is as noonday; who is waiting now, at the eleventh hour, for\r\nher to turn to him, and confess her sin, and cry for mercy\xe2\x80\x94now, before\r\nthe night of death comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever fled,\r\nlike yesterday that returneth not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaviour! It is yet time\xe2\x80\x94time to snatch this poor soul from everlasting\r\ndarkness. I believe\xe2\x80\x94I believe in thy infinite love. What is _my_ love\r\nor _my_ pleading? It is quenched in thine. I can only clasp her in my\r\nweak arms and urge her with my weak pity. Thou\xe2\x80\x94thou wilt breathe on the\r\ndead soul, and it shall arise from the unanswering sleep of death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, Lord, I see thee, coming through the darkness, coming, like the\r\nmorning, with healing on thy wings. The marks of thy agony are upon\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94I see, I see thou art able and willing to save\xe2\x80\x94thou wilt not let\r\nher perish for ever. Come, mighty Saviour! Let the dead hear thy voice.\r\nLet the eyes of the blind be opened. Let her see that God encompasses\r\nher. Let her tremble at nothing but at the sin that cuts her off from\r\nhim. Melt the hard heart. Unseal the closed lips: make her cry with her\r\nwhole soul, \xe2\x80\x98Father, I have sinned.\xe2\x80\x99...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty sobbed out, throwing her arms round Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s neck, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill speak... I will tell... I won\xe2\x80\x99t hide it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the tears and sobs were too violent. Dinah raised her gently from\r\nher knees and seated her on the pallet again, sitting down by her side.\r\nIt was a long time before the convulsed throat was quiet, and even then\r\nthey sat some time in stillness and darkness, holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. At last Hetty whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI did do it, Dinah... I buried it in\r\nthe wood... the little baby... and it cried... I heard it cry... ever\r\nsuch a way off... all night... and I went back because it cried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought perhaps it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die\xe2\x80\x94there might somebody find it. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t kill it\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill it myself. I put it down there and covered\r\nit up, and when I came back it was gone.... It was because I was so\r\nvery miserable, Dinah... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to go... and I tried to\r\nkill myself before, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, I tried so to drown myself in\r\nthe pool, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I went to Windsor\xe2\x80\x94I ran away\xe2\x80\x94did you know? I\r\nwent to find him, as he might take care of me; and he was gone; and\r\nthen I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I daredn\xe2\x80\x99t go back home again\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have bore to look at anybody, for they\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nscorned me. I thought o\xe2\x80\x99 you sometimes, and thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come to you,\r\nfor I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d be cross with me, and cry shame on me. I\r\nthought I could tell you. But then the other folks \xe2\x80\x99ud come to know it\r\nat last, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear that. It was partly thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 you made\r\nme come toward Stoniton; and, besides, I was so frightened at going\r\nwandering about till I was a beggar-woman, and had nothing; and\r\nsometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than that.\r\nOh, it was so dreadful, Dinah... I was so miserable... I wished I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever been born into this world. I should never like to go into the\r\ngreen fields again\xe2\x80\x94I hated \xe2\x80\x99em so in my misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty paused again, as if the sense of the past were too strong upon\r\nher for words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I got to Stoniton, and I began to feel frightened that night,\r\nbecause I was so near home. And then the little baby was born, when I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it; and the thought came into my mind that I might get\r\nrid of it and go home again. The thought came all of a sudden, as I was\r\nlying in the bed, and it got stronger and stronger... I longed so to go\r\nback again... I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear being so lonely and coming to beg for\r\nwant. And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress\r\nmyself. I felt I must do it... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how... I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d find\r\na pool, if I could, like that other, in the corner of the field, in the\r\ndark. And when the woman went out, I felt as if I was strong enough to\r\ndo anything... I thought I should get rid of all my misery, and go back\r\nhome, and never let \xe2\x80\x99em know why I ran away. I put on my bonnet and\r\nshawl, and went out into the dark street, with the baby under my cloak;\r\nand I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off, and there\r\nwas a public, and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread. And I\r\nwalked on and on, and I hardly felt the ground I trod on; and it got\r\nlighter, for there came the moon\xe2\x80\x94oh, Dinah, it frightened me when it\r\nfirst looked at me out o\xe2\x80\x99 the clouds\xe2\x80\x94it never looked so before; and I\r\nturned out of the road into the fields, for I was afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 meeting\r\nanybody with the moon shining on me. And I came to a haystack, where I\r\nthought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night. There was a\r\nplace cut into it, where I could make me a bed, and I lay comfortable,\r\nand the baby was warm against me; and I must have gone to sleep for a\r\ngood while, for when I woke it was morning, but not very light, and the\r\nbaby was crying. And I saw a wood a little way off... I thought there\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nperhaps be a ditch or a pond there... and it was so early I thought I\r\ncould hide the child there, and get a long way off before folks was up.\r\nAnd then I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d go home\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d get rides in carts and go home and\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99em I\xe2\x80\x99d been to try and see for a place, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get one. I\r\nlonged so for it, Dinah, I longed so to be safe at home. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow I felt about the baby. I seemed to hate it\xe2\x80\x94it was like a heavy\r\nweight hanging round my neck; and yet its crying went through me, and I\r\ndaredn\xe2\x80\x99t look at its little hands and face. But I went on to the wood,\r\nand I walked about, but there was no water....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty shuddered. She was silent for some moments, and when she began\r\nagain, it was in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf, and I sat\r\ndown on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all of a\r\nsudden I saw a hole under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And it\r\ndarted into me like lightning\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d lay the baby there and cover it with\r\nthe grass and the chips. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill it any other way. And I\xe2\x80\x99d done\r\nit in a minute; and, oh, it cried so, Dinah\xe2\x80\x94I _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ cover it quite\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94I thought perhaps somebody \xe2\x80\x99ud come and take care of it, and then it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die. And I made haste out of the wood, but I could hear it\r\ncrying all the while; and when I got out into the fields, it was as if\r\nI was held fast\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, for all I wanted so to go. And I\r\nsat against the haystack to watch if anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud come. I was very\r\nhungry, and I\xe2\x80\x99d only a bit of bread left, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away. And\r\nafter ever such a while\xe2\x80\x94hours and hours\xe2\x80\x94the man came\xe2\x80\x94him in a\r\nsmock-frock, and he looked at me so, I was frightened, and I made haste\r\nand went on. I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find\r\nthe baby. And I went right on, till I came to a village, a long way off\r\nfrom the wood, and I was very sick, and faint, and hungry. I got\r\nsomething to eat there, and bought a loaf. But I was frightened to\r\nstay. I heard the baby crying, and thought the other folks heard it\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94and I went on. But I was so tired, and it was getting towards dark.\r\nAnd at last, by the roadside there was a barn\xe2\x80\x94ever such a way off any\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94like the barn in Abbot\xe2\x80\x99s Close, and I thought I could go in there\r\nand hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody \xe2\x80\x99ud be likely to\r\ncome. I went in, and it was half full o\xe2\x80\x99 trusses of straw, and there\r\nwas some hay too. And I made myself a bed, ever so far behind, where\r\nnobody could find me; and I was so tired and weak, I went to sleep....\r\nBut oh, the baby\xe2\x80\x99s crying kept waking me, and I thought that man as\r\nlooked at me so was come and laying hold of me. But I must have slept a\r\nlong while at last, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, for when I got up and went\r\nout of the barn, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was night or morning. But it\r\nwas morning, for it kept getting lighter, and I turned back the way I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, Dinah; it was the baby\xe2\x80\x99s crying made me\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x94and yet I was frightened to death. I thought that man in the\r\nsmock-frock \xe2\x80\x99ud see me and know I put the baby there. But I went on,\r\nfor all that. I\xe2\x80\x99d left off thinking about going home\xe2\x80\x94it had gone out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy mind. I saw nothing but that place in the wood where I\xe2\x80\x99d buried the\r\nbaby... I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence seemed long\r\nbefore she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood.... I\r\nknew the way to the place... the place against the nut-tree; and I\r\ncould hear it crying at every step.... I thought it was alive.... I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I was frightened or glad... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nfelt. I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And when I\xe2\x80\x99d put it there, I\r\nthought I should like somebody to find it and save it from dying; but\r\nwhen I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with fear. I never\r\nthought o\xe2\x80\x99 stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t run away, and\r\neverybody as saw me \xe2\x80\x99ud know about the baby. My heart went like a\r\nstone. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish or try for anything; it seemed like as if I\r\nshould stay there for ever, and nothing \xe2\x80\x99ud ever change. But they came\r\nand took me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still\r\nsomething behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that\r\ntears must come before words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place in\r\nthe wood, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve told everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us pray, poor sinner. Let us fall on our knees again, and pray to\r\nthe God of all mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI\r\nThe Hours of Suspense\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, when the church bells in Stoniton were ringing for\r\nmorning service, Bartle Massey re-entered Adam\xe2\x80\x99s room, after a short\r\nabsence, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam, here\xe2\x80\x99s a visitor wants to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was seated with his back towards the door, but he started up and\r\nturned round instantly, with a flushed face and an eager look. His face\r\nwas even thinner and more worn than we have seen it before, but he was\r\nwashed and shaven this Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it any news?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep yourself quiet, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep quiet. It\xe2\x80\x99s not what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of. It\xe2\x80\x99s the young Methodist woman come from the\r\nprison. She\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom o\xe2\x80\x99 the stairs, and wants to know if you\r\nthink well to see her, for she has something to say to you about that\r\npoor castaway; but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in without your leave, she said.\r\nShe thought you\xe2\x80\x99d perhaps like to go out and speak to her. These\r\npreaching women are not so back\xe2\x80\x99ard commonly,\xe2\x80\x9d Bartle muttered to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk her to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\nHe was standing with his face towards the door, and as Dinah entered,\r\nlifting up her mild grey eyes towards him, she saw at once the great\r\nchange that had come since the day when she had looked up at the tall\r\nman in the cottage. There was a trembling in her clear voice as she put\r\nher hand into his and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBe comforted, Adam Bede, the Lord has not\r\nforsaken her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you for coming to her,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Massey brought me word\r\nyesterday as you was come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey could neither of them say any more just yet, but stood before each\r\nother in silence; and Bartle Massey, too, who had put on his\r\nspectacles, seemed transfixed, examining Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face. But he recovered\r\nhimself first, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSit down, young woman, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d placing the\r\nchair for her and retiring to his old seat on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, friend; I won\xe2\x80\x99t sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I must hasten\r\nback. She entreated me not to stay long away. What I came for, Adam\r\nBede, was to pray you to go and see the poor sinner and bid her\r\nfarewell. She desires to ask your forgiveness, and it is meet you\r\nshould see her to-day, rather than in the early morning, when the time\r\nwill be short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam stood trembling, and at last sank down on his chair again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll be put off\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps come a\r\npardon. Mr. Irwine said there was hope. He said, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t quite give\r\nit up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a blessed thought to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, her eyes filling with\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let what will be,\xe2\x80\x9d she added presently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will surely come, and\r\nlet her speak the words that are in her heart. Although her poor soul\r\nis very dark and discerns little beyond the things of the flesh, she is\r\nno longer hard. She is contrite, she has confessed all to me. The pride\r\nof her heart has given way, and she leans on me for help and desires to\r\nbe taught. This fills me with trust, for I cannot but think that the\r\nbrethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge. She is going to write a letter to the friends at the Hall\r\nFarm for me to give them when she is gone, and when I told her you were\r\nhere, she said, \xe2\x80\x98I should like to say good-bye to Adam and ask him to\r\nforgive me.\xe2\x80\x99 You will come, Adam? Perhaps you will even now come back\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say good-bye while there\xe2\x80\x99s any hope. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nlistening, and listening\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing but that. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nas she\xe2\x80\x99ll die that shameful death\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring my mind to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up from his chair again and looked away out of the window, while\r\nDinah stood with compassionate patience. In a minute or two he turned\r\nround and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ come, Dinah... to-morrow morning... if it must be. I may have\r\nmore strength to bear it, if I know it _must_ be. Tell her, I forgive\r\nher; tell her I will come\xe2\x80\x94at the very last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not urge you against the voice of your own heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hasten back to her, for it is wonderful how she clings now, and\r\nwas not willing to let me out of her sight. She used never to make any\r\nreturn to my affection before, but now tribulation has opened her\r\nheart. Farewell, Adam. Our heavenly Father comfort you and strengthen\r\nyou to bear all things.\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah put out her hand, and Adam pressed it in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nBartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for\r\nher, but before he could reach it, she had said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d and was gone, with her light step down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, taking off his spectacles and putting them into\r\nhis pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cif there must be women to make trouble in the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbut fair there should be women to be comforters under it; and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she\xe2\x80\x99s a Methodist; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting a\r\nwoman without some foolishness or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam never went to bed that night. The excitement of suspense,\r\nheightening with every hour that brought him nearer the fatal moment,\r\nwas too great, and in spite of his entreaties, in spite of his promises\r\nthat he would be perfectly quiet, the schoolmaster watched too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to me, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d Bartle said: \xe2\x80\x9ca night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep more or\r\nless? I shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground. Let me keep\r\nthee company in trouble while I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a long and dreary night in that small chamber. Adam would\r\nsometimes get up and tread backwards and forwards along the short space\r\nfrom wall to wall; then he would sit down and hide his face, and no\r\nsound would be heard but the ticking of the watch on the table, or the\r\nfalling of a cinder from the fire which the schoolmaster carefully\r\ntended. Sometimes he would burst out into vehement speech,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 done anything to save her\xe2\x80\x94if my bearing anything would\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 done any good... but t\xe2\x80\x99 have to sit still, and know it, and do\r\nnothing... it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for a man to bear... and to think o\xe2\x80\x99 what might\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 been now, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for _him_.... O God, it\xe2\x80\x99s the very day\r\nwe should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s heavy\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s heavy. But you\r\nmust remember this: when you thought of marrying her, you\xe2\x80\x99d a notion\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d got another sort of a nature inside her. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t think she\r\ncould have got hardened in that little while to do what she\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought she was loving and\r\ntender-hearted, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell a lie, or act deceitful. How could I\r\nthink any other way? And if he\xe2\x80\x99d never come near her, and I\xe2\x80\x99d married\r\nher, and been loving to her, and took care of her, she might never ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndone anything bad. What would it ha\xe2\x80\x99 signified\xe2\x80\x94my having a bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrouble with her? It \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been nothing to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing, my lad\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what might have come.\r\nThe smart\xe2\x80\x99s bad for you to bear now: you must have time\xe2\x80\x94you must have\r\ntime. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve that opinion of you, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll rise above it all and\r\nbe a man again, and there may good come out of this that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood come out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nevil: _her_ ruin can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone. I hate that talk o\xe2\x80\x99 people, as if\r\nthere was a way o\xe2\x80\x99 making amends for everything. They\xe2\x80\x99d more need be\r\nbrought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered. When a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspoiled his fellow-creatur\xe2\x80\x99s life, he\xe2\x80\x99s no right to comfort himself\r\nwith thinking good may come out of it. Somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s good doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalter her shame and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lad, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, in a gentle tone, strangely in contrast\r\nwith his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlikely enough I talk foolishness. I\xe2\x80\x99m an old fellow, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nmany years since I was in trouble myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy finding reasons why\r\nother folks should be patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam penitently, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very hot and hasty. I owe you\r\nsomething different; but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take it ill of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, lad\xe2\x80\x94not I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the night wore on in agitation till the chill dawn and the growing\r\nlight brought the tremulous quiet that comes on the brink of despair.\r\nThere would soon be no more suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the prison now, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, when he saw the\r\nhand of his watch at six. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any news come, we shall hear\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe people were astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction,\r\nthrough the streets. Adam tried not to think where they were going, as\r\nthey hurried past him in that short space between his lodging and the\r\nprison gates. He was thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing\r\nthose eager people.\r\n\r\nNo; there was no news come\xe2\x80\x94no pardon\xe2\x80\x94no reprieve.\r\n\r\nAdam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself\r\nto send word to Dinah that he was come. But a voice caught his ear: he\r\ncould not shut out the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cart is to set off at half-past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be said\xe2\x80\x94the last good-bye: there was no help.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes from that time, Adam was at the door of the cell. Dinah\r\nhad sent him word that she could not come to him; she could not leave\r\nHetty one moment; but Hetty was prepared for the meeting.\r\n\r\nHe could not see her when he entered, for agitation deadened his\r\nsenses, and the dim cell was almost dark to him. He stood a moment\r\nafter the door closed behind him, trembling and stupefied.\r\n\r\nBut he began to see through the dimness\xe2\x80\x94to see the dark eyes lifted up\r\nto him once more, but with no smile in them. O God, how sad they\r\nlooked! The last time they had met his was when he parted from her with\r\nhis heart full of joyous hopeful love, and they looked out with a\r\ntearful smile from a pink, dimpled, childish face. The face was marble\r\nnow; the sweet lips were pallid and half-open and quivering; the\r\ndimples were all gone\xe2\x80\x94all but one, that never went; and the eyes\xe2\x80\x94O, the\r\nworst of all was the likeness they had to Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s. They were Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes looking at him with that mournful gaze, as if she had come back to\r\nhim from the dead to tell him of her misery.\r\n\r\nShe was clinging close to Dinah; her cheek was against Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s. It\r\nseemed as if her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and\r\nthe pitying love that shone out from Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face looked like a visible\r\npledge of the Invisible Mercy.\r\n\r\nWhen the sad eyes met\xe2\x80\x94when Hetty and Adam looked at each other\xe2\x80\x94she felt\r\nthe change in him too, and it seemed to strike her with fresh fear. It\r\nwas the first time she had seen any being whose face seemed to reflect\r\nthe change in herself: Adam was a new image of the dreadful past and\r\nthe dreadful present. She trembled more as she looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said; \xe2\x80\x9ctell him what is in your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHetty obeyed her, like a little child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam... I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry... I behaved very wrong to you... will you\r\nforgive me... before I die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam answered with a half-sob, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I forgive thee Hetty. I forgave\r\nthee long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to Adam as if his brain would burst with the anguish of\r\nmeeting Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in the first moments, but the sound of her voice\r\nuttering these penitent words touched a chord which had been less\r\nstrained. There was a sense of relief from what was becoming\r\nunbearable, and the rare tears came\xe2\x80\x94they had never come before, since\r\nhe had hung on Seth\xe2\x80\x99s neck in the beginning of his sorrow.\r\n\r\nHetty made an involuntary movement towards him, some of the love that\r\nshe had once lived in the midst of was come near her again. She kept\r\nhold of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s hand, but she went up to Adam and said timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou kiss me again, Adam, for all I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so wicked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him, and they gave\r\neach other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d Hetty said, in rather a stronger voice, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him...\r\nfor there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else to tell him... as I went after him and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind him... and I hated him and cursed him once... but Dinah says I\r\nshould forgive him... and I try... for else God won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a noise at the door of the cell now\xe2\x80\x94the key was being turned\r\nin the lock, and when the door opened, Adam saw indistinctly that there\r\nwere several faces there. He was too agitated to see more\xe2\x80\x94even to see\r\nthat Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s face was one of them. He felt that the last\r\npreparations were beginning, and he could stay no longer. Room was\r\nsilently made for him to depart, and he went to his chamber in\r\nloneliness, leaving Bartle Massey to watch and see the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII\r\nThe Last Moment\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sight that some people remembered better even than their own\r\nsorrows\xe2\x80\x94the sight in that grey clear morning, when the fatal cart with\r\nthe two young women in it was descried by the waiting watching\r\nmultitude, cleaving its way towards the hideous symbol of a\r\ndeliberately inflicted sudden death.\r\n\r\nAll Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris, the young Methodist woman who\r\nhad brought the obstinate criminal to confess, and there was as much\r\neagerness to see her as to see the wretched Hetty.\r\n\r\nBut Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude. When Hetty had caught\r\nsight of the vast crowd in the distance, she had clutched Dinah\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose your eyes, Hetty,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us pray without ceasing\r\nto God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the midst of\r\nthe gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the wrestling\r\nintensity of a last pleading, for the trembling creature that clung to\r\nher and clutched her as the only visible sign of love and pity.\r\n\r\nDinah did not know that the crowd was silent, gazing at her with a sort\r\nof awe\xe2\x80\x94she did not even know how near they were to the fatal spot, when\r\nthe cart stopped, and she shrank appalled at a loud shout hideous to\r\nher ear, like a vast yell of demons. Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s shriek mingled with the\r\nsound, and they clasped each other in mutual horror.\r\n\r\nBut it was not a shout of execration\xe2\x80\x94not a yell of exultant cruelty.\r\n\r\nIt was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a horseman\r\ncleaving the crowd at full gallop. The horse is hot and distressed, but\r\nanswers to the desperate spurring; the rider looks as if his eyes were\r\nglazed by madness, and he saw nothing but what was unseen by others.\r\nSee, he has something in his hand\xe2\x80\x94he is holding it up as if it were a\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff knows him: it is Arthur Donnithorne, carrying in his hand a\r\nhard-won release from death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII\r\nAnother Meeting in the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, at evening, two men were walking from opposite points\r\ntowards the same scene, drawn thither by a common memory. The scene was\r\nthe Grove by Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were.\r\n\r\nThe old squire\xe2\x80\x99s funeral had taken place that morning, the will had\r\nbeen read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had\r\ncome out for a lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new\r\nfuture before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought\r\nhe could do that best in the Grove.\r\n\r\nAdam too had come from Stoniton on Monday evening, and to-day he had\r\nnot left home, except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell\r\nthem everything that Mr. Irwine had left untold. He had agreed with the\r\nPoysers that he would follow them to their new neighbourhood, wherever\r\nthat might be, for he meant to give up the management of the woods,\r\nand, as soon as it was practicable, he would wind up his business with\r\nJonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in a home within\r\nreach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeth and me are sure to find work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA man that\xe2\x80\x99s got our\r\ntrade at his finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must make a new\r\nstart. My mother won\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way, for she\xe2\x80\x99s told me, since I\r\ncame home, she\xe2\x80\x99d made up her mind to being buried in another parish, if\r\nI wished it, and if I\xe2\x80\x99d be more comfortable elsewhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful\r\nhow quiet she\xe2\x80\x99s been ever since I came back. It seems as if the very\r\ngreatness o\xe2\x80\x99 the trouble had quieted and calmed her. We shall all be\r\nbetter in a new country, though there\xe2\x80\x99s some I shall be loath to leave\r\nbehind. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t part from you and yours, if I can help it, Mr.\r\nPoyser. Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s made us kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go out o\xe2\x80\x99 hearing o\xe2\x80\x99 that man\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\nBut I doubt we shall ne\xe2\x80\x99er go far enough for folks not to find out as\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got them belonging to us as are transported o\xe2\x80\x99er the seas, and\r\nwere like to be hanged. We shall have that flyin\xe2\x80\x99 up in our faces, and\r\nour children\xe2\x80\x99s after us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a long visit to the Hall Farm, and drew too strongly on Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenergies for him to think of seeing others, or re-entering on his old\r\noccupations till the morrow. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo to work again. I shall learn to like it again some time, maybe; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s right whether I like it or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis evening was the last he would allow to be absorbed by sorrow:\r\nsuspense was gone now, and he must bear the unalterable. He was\r\nresolved not to see Arthur Donnithorne again, if it were possible to\r\navoid him. He had no message to deliver from Hetty now, for Hetty had\r\nseen Arthur. And Adam distrusted himself\xe2\x80\x94he had learned to dread the\r\nviolence of his own feeling. That word of Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that he must\r\nremember what he had felt after giving the last blow to Arthur in the\r\nGrove\xe2\x80\x94had remained with him.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts about Arthur, like all thoughts that are charged with\r\nstrong feeling, were continually recurring, and they always called up\r\nthe image of the Grove\xe2\x80\x94of that spot under the overarching boughs where\r\nhe had caught sight of the two bending figures, and had been possessed\r\nby sudden rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see it again to-night for the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo me good; it\xe2\x80\x99ll make me feel over again what I felt when I\xe2\x80\x99d knocked\r\nhim down. I felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99d done it,\r\n_before_ I began to think he might be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking towards the\r\nsame spot at the same time.\r\n\r\nAdam had on his working-dress again, now, for he had thrown off the\r\nother with a sense of relief as soon as he came home; and if he had had\r\nthe basket of tools over his shoulder, he might have been taken, with\r\nhis pale wasted face, for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the\r\nGrove on that August evening eight months ago. But he had no basket of\r\ntools, and he was not walking with the old erectness, looking keenly\r\nround him; his hands were thrust in his side pockets, and his eyes\r\nrested chiefly on the ground. He had not long entered the Grove, and\r\nnow he paused before a beech. He knew that tree well; it was the\r\nboundary mark of his youth\xe2\x80\x94the sign, to him, of the time when some of\r\nhis earliest, strongest feelings had left him. He felt sure they would\r\nnever return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of\r\naffection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had\r\nbelieved in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago. It\r\nwas affection for the dead: _that_ Arthur existed no longer.\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps, but the beech\r\nstood at a turning in the road, and he could not see who was coming\r\nuntil the tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before him\r\nat only two yards\xe2\x80\x99 distance. They both started, and looked at each\r\nother in silence. Often, in the last fortnight, Adam had imagined\r\nhimself as close to Arthur as this, assailing him with words that\r\nshould be as harrowing as the voice of remorse, forcing upon him a just\r\nshare in the misery he had caused; and often, too, he had told himself\r\nthat such a meeting had better not be. But in imagining the meeting he\r\nhad always seen Arthur, as he had met him on that evening in the Grove,\r\nflorid, careless, light of speech; and the figure before him touched\r\nhim with the signs of suffering. Adam knew what suffering was\xe2\x80\x94he could\r\nnot lay a cruel finger on a bruised man. He felt no impulse that he\r\nneeded to resist. Silence was more just than reproach. Arthur was the\r\nfirst to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be a good thing that we have met\r\nhere, for I wished to see you. I should have asked to see you\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, but Adam said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is painful to you to meet me,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\r\nnot likely to happen again for years to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was what I meant to write to you\r\nto-morrow, as it would be better all dealings should be at an end\r\nbetween us, and somebody else put in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur felt the answer keenly, and it was not without an effort that he\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto lessen your indignation against me, or ask you to do anything for my\r\nsake. I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil\r\nconsequences of the past, which is unchangeable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nconsequences to myself, but to others. It is but little I can do, I\r\nknow. I know the worst consequences will remain; but something may be\r\ndone, and you can help me. Will you listen to me patiently?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, after some hesitation; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hear what it is. If\r\nI can help to mend anything, I will. Anger \xe2\x80\x99ull mend nothing, I know.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to the Hermitage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go there with me\r\nand sit down? We can talk better there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hermitage had never been entered since they left it together, for\r\nArthur had locked up the key in his desk. And now, when he opened the\r\ndoor, there was the candle burnt out in the socket; there was the chair\r\nin the same place where Adam remembered sitting; there was the\r\nwaste-paper basket full of scraps, and deep down in it, Arthur felt in\r\nan instant, there was the little pink silk handkerchief. It would have\r\nbeen painful to enter this place if their previous thoughts had been\r\nless painful.\r\n\r\nThey sat down opposite each other in the old places, and Arthur said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going away, Adam; I\xe2\x80\x99m going into the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this\r\nannouncement\xe2\x80\x94ought to have a movement of sympathy towards him. But\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s lips remained firmly closed, and the expression of his face\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis this: one of my\r\nreasons for going away is that no one else may leave Hayslope\xe2\x80\x94may leave\r\ntheir home on my account. I would do anything, there is no sacrifice I\r\nwould not make, to prevent any further injury to others through\r\nmy\xe2\x80\x94through what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s words had precisely the opposite effect to that he had\r\nanticipated. Adam thought he perceived in them that notion of\r\ncompensation for irretrievable wrong, that self-soothing attempt to\r\nmake evil bear the same fruits as good, which most of all roused his\r\nindignation. He was as strongly impelled to look painful facts right in\r\nthe face as Arthur was to turn away his eyes from them. Moreover, he\r\nhad the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in the presence of a\r\nrich man. He felt his old severity returning as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe time\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast for that, sir. A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing\r\na wrong; sacrifices won\xe2\x80\x99t undo it when it\xe2\x80\x99s done. When people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings have got a deadly wound, they can\xe2\x80\x99t be cured with favours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFavours!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, passionately; \xe2\x80\x9cno; how can you suppose I meant\r\nthat? But the Poysers\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the\r\nplace where they have lived so many years\xe2\x80\x94for generations. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee, as Mr. Irwine does, that if they could be persuaded to overcome\r\nthe feeling that drives them away, it would be much better for them in\r\nthe end to remain on the old spot, among the friends and neighbours who\r\nknow them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, sir, folks\xe2\x80\x99s feelings are\r\nnot so easily overcome. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a\r\nstrange place, among strange faces, when he\xe2\x80\x99s been bred up on the Hall\r\nFarm, and his father before him; but then it \xe2\x80\x99ud be harder for a man\r\nwith his feelings to stay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how the thing\xe2\x80\x99s to be made any\r\nother than hard. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 damage, sir, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be made up\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was silent some moments. In spite of other feelings dominant in\r\nhim this evening, his pride winced under Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mode of treating him.\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t he himself suffering? Was not he too obliged to renounce his\r\nmost cherished hopes? It was now as it had been eight months ago\xe2\x80\x94Adam\r\nwas forcing Arthur to feel more intensely the irrevocableness of his\r\nown wrong-doing. He was presenting the sort of resistance that was the\r\nmost irritating to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s eager ardent nature. But his anger was\r\nsubdued by the same influence that had subdued Adam\xe2\x80\x99s when they first\r\nconfronted each other\xe2\x80\x94by the marks of suffering in a long familiar\r\nface. The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he could bear a\r\ngreat deal from Adam, to whom he had been the occasion of bearing so\r\nmuch; but there was a touch of pleading, boyish vexation in his tone as\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conduct\xe2\x80\x94by\r\ngiving way to anger and satisfying that for the moment, instead of\r\nthinking what will be the effect in the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were going to stay here and act as landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d he added presently,\r\nwith still more eagerness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif I were careless about what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been the cause of, you would have some excuse, Adam, for going\r\naway and encouraging others to go. You would have some excuse then for\r\ntrying to make the evil worse. But when I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m going away for\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94when you know what that means for me, how it cuts off every plan\r\nof happiness I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever formed\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible for a sensible man like\r\nyou to believe that there is any real ground for the Poysers refusing\r\nto remain. I know their feeling about disgrace\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Irwine has told me\r\nall; but he is of opinion that they might be persuaded out of this idea\r\nthat they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours, and that they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t remain on my estate, if you would join him in his efforts\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nwould stay yourself and go on managing the old woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur paused a moment and then added, pleadingly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood work to do for the sake of other people, besides the owner. And\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know but that they may have a better owner soon, whom you\r\nwill like to work for. If I die, my cousin Tradgett will have the\r\nestate and take my name. He is a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him not to feel\r\nthat this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had\r\nloved and been proud of in old days; but nearer memories would not be\r\nthrust away. He was silent; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that\r\ninduced him to go on, with growing earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, if you would talk to the Poysers\xe2\x80\x94if you would talk the\r\nmatter over with Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x94he means to see you to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94and then if\r\nyou would join your arguments to his to prevail on them not to go.... I\r\nknow, of course, that they would not accept any favour from me\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\nnothing of that kind\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they would suffer less in the end.\r\nIrwine thinks so too. And Mr. Irwine is to have the chief authority on\r\nthe estate\xe2\x80\x94he has consented to undertake that. They will really be\r\nunder no man but one whom they respect and like. It would be the same\r\nwith you, Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse\r\npain that could incline you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was silent again for a little while, and then said, with some\r\nagitation in his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t act so towards you, I know. If you\r\nwere in my place and I in yours, I should try to help you to do the\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground.\r\nArthur went on, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve had bitterly\r\nto repent of in your life, Adam; if you had, you would be more\r\ngenerous. You would know then that it\xe2\x80\x99s worse for me than for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur rose from his seat with the last words, and went to one of the\r\nwindows, looking out and turning his back on Adam, as he continued,\r\npassionately,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t _I_ loved her too? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I see her yesterday? Shan\xe2\x80\x99t I carry\r\nthe thought of her about with me as much as you will? And don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink you would suffer more if you\xe2\x80\x99d been in fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwas not easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little\r\npermanence, can hardly understand how much inward resistance he\r\novercame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur\r\nheard the movement, and turning round, met the sad but softened look\r\nwith which Adam said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true what you say, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m hard\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s in my nature. I was too\r\nhard with my father, for doing wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a bit hard t\xe2\x80\x99 everybody\r\nbut _her_. I felt as if nobody pitied her enough\xe2\x80\x94her suffering cut into\r\nme so; and when I thought the folks at the farm were too hard with her,\r\nI said I\xe2\x80\x99d never be hard to anybody myself again. But feeling overmuch\r\nabout her has perhaps made me unfair to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known what it is in\r\nmy life to repent and feel it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I felt I\xe2\x80\x99d been too harsh to\r\nmy father when he was gone from me\xe2\x80\x94I feel it now, when I think of him.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is\r\nresolved to leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say; but he went\r\non with more hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked me\xe2\x80\x94but if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do it now, for all I refused then...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s white hand was in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s large grasp in an instant, and with\r\nthat action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the old, boyish\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, \xe2\x80\x9cit would never\r\nhave happened if I\xe2\x80\x99d known you loved her. That would have helped to\r\nsave me from it. And I _did_ struggle: I never meant to injure her. I\r\ndeceived you afterwards\xe2\x80\x94and that led on to worse; but I thought it was\r\nforced upon me, I thought it was the best thing I could do. And in that\r\nletter I told her to let me know if she were in any trouble: don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I would not have done everything I could. But I was all wrong\r\nfrom the very first, and horrible wrong has come of it. God knows, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive my life if I could undo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down again opposite each other, and Adam said, tremulously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did she seem when you left her, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sometimes as if I should go\r\nmad with thinking of her looks and what she said to me, and then, that\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a full pardon\xe2\x80\x94that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t save her from that\r\nwretched fate of being transported\xe2\x80\x94that I can do nothing for her all\r\nthose years; and she may die under it, and never know comfort any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, for the first time feeling his own pain merged in\r\nsympathy for Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and me\xe2\x80\x99ll often be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 the same\r\nthing, when we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way off one another. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pray God to help\r\nyou, as I pray him to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s that sweet woman\xe2\x80\x94that Dinah Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said, pursuing\r\nhis own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cshe says she shall stay with her to the very last moment\xe2\x80\x94till\r\nshe goes; and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort\r\nin her. I could worship that woman; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should do if\r\nshe were not there. Adam, you will see her when she comes back. I could\r\nsay nothing to her yesterday\xe2\x80\x94nothing of what I felt towards her. Tell\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur went on hurriedly, as if he wanted to hide the emotion\r\nwith which he spoke, while he took off his chain and watch, \xe2\x80\x9ctell her I\r\nasked you to give her this in remembrance of me\xe2\x80\x94of the man to whom she\r\nis the one source of comfort, when he thinks of... I know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare about such things\xe2\x80\x94or anything else I can give her for its own\r\nsake. But she will use the watch\xe2\x80\x94I shall like to think of her using\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to her, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell her your words. She\r\ntold me she should come back to the people at the Hall Farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you _will_ persuade the Poysers to stay, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur,\r\nreminded of the subject which both of them had forgotten in the first\r\ninterchange of revived friendship. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ stay yourself, and help\r\nMr. Irwine to carry out the repairs and improvements on the estate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, sir, that perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t take account of,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAdam, with hesitating gentleness, \xe2\x80\x9cand that was what made me hang back\r\nlonger. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with both me and the Poysers: if we\r\nstay, it\xe2\x80\x99s for our own worldly interest, and it looks as if we\xe2\x80\x99d put up\r\nwith anything for the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 that. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll feel,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling a little of it myself. When folks have got an\r\nhonourable independent spirit, they don\xe2\x80\x99t like to do anything that\r\nmight make \xe2\x80\x99em seem base-minded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no one who knows you will think that, Adam. That is not a reason\r\nstrong enough against a course that is really more generous, more\r\nunselfish than the other. And it will be known\xe2\x80\x94it shall be made known,\r\nthat both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty. Adam, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\nmake things worse for me; I\xe2\x80\x99m punished enough without that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful affection.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid I should make things worse for you. I used to wish I could\r\ndo it, in my passion\xe2\x80\x94but that was when I thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nenough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the best I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nthink of now\xe2\x80\x94to do my work well and make the world a bit better place\r\nfor them as can enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll part now, Adam. You will see Mr. Irwine to-morrow, and\r\nconsult with him about everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going soon, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as possible\xe2\x80\x94after I\xe2\x80\x99ve made the necessary arrangements.\r\nGood-bye, Adam. I shall think of you going about the old place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, sir. God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hands were clasped once more, and Adam left the Hermitage, feeling\r\nthat sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the door was closed behind him, Arthur went to the\r\nwaste-paper basket and took out the little pink silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Sixth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX\r\nAt the Hall Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801\xe2\x80\x94more than eighteen months\r\nafter that parting of Adam and Arthur in the Hermitage\xe2\x80\x94was on the yard\r\nat the Hall Farm; and the bull-dog was in one of his most excited\r\nmoments, for it was that hour of the day when the cows were being\r\ndriven into the yard for their afternoon milking. No wonder the patient\r\nbeasts ran confusedly into the wrong places, for the alarming din of\r\nthe bull-dog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid\r\nfeminine creatures, with pardonable superstition, imagined also to have\r\nsome relation to their own movements\xe2\x80\x94with the tremendous crack of the\r\nwaggoner\xe2\x80\x99s whip, the roar of his voice, and the booming thunder of the\r\nwaggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of its golden load.\r\n\r\nThe milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at this hour\r\non mild days she was usually standing at the house door, with her\r\nknitting in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a\r\nkeener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a\r\npailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive\r\npunishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, Mrs. Poyser gave but a divided attention to the\r\narrival of the cows, for she was in eager discussion with Dinah, who\r\nwas stitching Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s shirt-collars, and had borne patiently to\r\nhave her thread broken three times by Totty pulling at her arm with a\r\nsudden insistence that she should look at \xe2\x80\x9cBaby,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, at a large\r\nwooden doll with no legs and a long skirt, whose bald head Totty,\r\nseated in her small chair at Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s side, was caressing and pressing\r\nto her fat cheek with much fervour. Totty is larger by more than two\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 growth than when you first saw her, and she has on a black frock\r\nunder her pinafore. Mrs. Poyser too has on a black gown, which seems to\r\nheighten the family likeness between her and Dinah. In other respects\r\nthere is little outward change now discernible in our old friends, or\r\nin the pleasant house-place, bright with polished oak and pewter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw the like to you, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Poyser was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve once took anything into your head: there\xe2\x80\x99s no more moving you\r\nthan the rooted tree. You may say what you like, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\n_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ religion; for what\xe2\x80\x99s the Sermon on the Mount about, as you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nso fond o\xe2\x80\x99 reading to the boys, but doing what other folks \xe2\x80\x99ud have you\r\ndo? But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do, like\r\ntaking your cloak off and giving it to \xe2\x80\x99em, or letting \xe2\x80\x99em slap you i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe face, I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99d be ready enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when one \xe2\x80\x99ud have\r\nyou do what\xe2\x80\x99s plain common sense and good for yourself, as you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nobstinate th\xe2\x80\x99 other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, dear Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, smiling slightly as she went on with her\r\nwork, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure your wish \xe2\x80\x99ud be a reason for me to do anything that I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t feel it was wrong to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrong! You drive me past bearing. What is there wrong, I should like\r\nto know, i\xe2\x80\x99 staying along wi\xe2\x80\x99 your own friends, as are th\xe2\x80\x99 happier for\r\nhaving you with \xe2\x80\x99em an\xe2\x80\x99 are willing to provide for you, even if your\r\nwork didn\xe2\x80\x99t more nor pay \xe2\x80\x99em for the bit o\xe2\x80\x99 sparrow\xe2\x80\x99s victual y\xe2\x80\x99 eat\r\nand the bit o\xe2\x80\x99 rag you put on? An\xe2\x80\x99 who is it, I should like to know, as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re bound t\xe2\x80\x99 help and comfort i\xe2\x80\x99 the world more nor your own flesh\r\nand blood\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 me th\xe2\x80\x99 only aunt you\xe2\x80\x99ve got above-ground, an\xe2\x80\x99 am brought\r\nto the brink o\xe2\x80\x99 the grave welly every winter as comes, an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nchild as sits beside you \xe2\x80\x99ull break her little heart when you go, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth, an\xe2\x80\x99 your uncle \xe2\x80\x99ull miss\r\nyou so as never was\xe2\x80\x94a-lighting his pipe an\xe2\x80\x99 waiting on him, an\xe2\x80\x99 now I\r\ncan trust you wi\xe2\x80\x99 the butter, an\xe2\x80\x99 have had all the trouble o\xe2\x80\x99 teaching\r\nyou, and there\xe2\x80\x99s all the sewing to be done, an\xe2\x80\x99 I must have a strange\r\ngell out o\xe2\x80\x99 Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on to do it\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 all because you must go back to\r\nthat bare heap o\xe2\x80\x99 stones as the very crows fly over an\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t stop at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Aunt Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour kindness makes you say I\xe2\x80\x99m useful to you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t really want me\r\nnow, for Nancy and Molly are clever at their work, and you\xe2\x80\x99re in good\r\nhealth now, by the blessing of God, and my uncle is of a cheerful\r\ncountenance again, and you have neighbours and friends not a few\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nof them come to sit with my uncle almost daily. Indeed, you will not\r\nmiss me; and at Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need,\r\nwho have none of those comforts you have around you. I feel that I am\r\ncalled back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast. I feel drawn\r\nagain towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word\r\nof life to the sinful and desolate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou feel! Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, returning from a parenthetic glance\r\nat the cows, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s allays the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m to sit down wi\xe2\x80\x99, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\na mind to do anything contrairy. What do you want to be preaching for\r\nmore than you\xe2\x80\x99re preaching now? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you go off, the Lord knows where,\r\nevery Sunday a-preaching and praying? An\xe2\x80\x99 haven\xe2\x80\x99t you got Methodists\r\nenow at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on to go and look at, if church-folks\xe2\x80\x99s faces are too\r\nhandsome to please you? An\xe2\x80\x99 isn\xe2\x80\x99t there them i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish as you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot under hand, and they\xe2\x80\x99re like enough to make friends wi\xe2\x80\x99 Old Harry\r\nagain as soon as your back\xe2\x80\x99s turned? There\xe2\x80\x99s that Bessy Cranage\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe flaunting i\xe2\x80\x99 new finery three weeks after you\xe2\x80\x99re gone, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound. She\xe2\x80\x99ll no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog \xe2\x80\x99ull\r\nstand on its hind-legs when there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody looking. But I suppose it\r\ndoesna matter so much about folks\xe2\x80\x99s souls i\xe2\x80\x99 this country, else you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe for staying with your own aunt, for she\xe2\x80\x99s none so good but what you\r\nmight help her to be better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a certain something in Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s voice just then, which\r\nshe did not wish to be noticed, so she turned round hastily to look at\r\nthe clock, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee there! It\xe2\x80\x99s tea-time; an\xe2\x80\x99 if Martin\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nrick-yard, he\xe2\x80\x99ll like a cup. Here, Totty, my chicken, let mother put\r\nyour bonnet on, and then you go out into the rick-yard and see if\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s there, and tell him he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go away again without coming t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhave a cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea; and tell your brothers to come in too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTotty trotted off in her flapping bonnet, while Mrs. Poyser set out the\r\nbright oak table and reached down the tea-cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk o\xe2\x80\x99 them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i\xe2\x80\x99 their work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe began again; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking. They\xe2\x80\x99re all the same, clever or\r\nstupid\xe2\x80\x94one can\xe2\x80\x99t trust \xe2\x80\x99em out o\xe2\x80\x99 one\xe2\x80\x99s sight a minute. They want\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s eye on \xe2\x80\x99em constant if they\xe2\x80\x99re to be kept to their work. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m ill again this winter, as I was the winter before last?\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s to look after \xe2\x80\x99em then, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gone? An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s that blessed\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94something\xe2\x80\x99s sure t\xe2\x80\x99 happen to her\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll let her tumble into the\r\nfire, or get at the kettle wi\xe2\x80\x99 the boiling lard in\xe2\x80\x99t, or some mischief\r\nas \xe2\x80\x99ull lame her for life; an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all your fault, Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cI promise to come back to you in the winter if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re ill. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will ever stay away from you if you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nreal want of me. But, indeed, it is needful for my own soul that I\r\nshould go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all\r\nthings too richly to enjoy\xe2\x80\x94at least that I should go away for a short\r\nspace. No one can know but myself what are my inward needs, and the\r\nbesetments I am most in danger from. Your wish for me to stay is not a\r\ncall of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own\r\ndesires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest the love of the\r\ncreature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly\r\nlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Poyser, as she cut the bread and butter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true there\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nvictual enough about you, as nobody shall ever say I don\xe2\x80\x99t provide\r\nenough and to spare, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 odds an\xe2\x80\x99 ends as\r\nnobody else \xe2\x80\x99ud eat, you\xe2\x80\x99re sure to pick it out... but look there!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Bede a-carrying the little un in. I wonder how it is he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome so early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her\r\ndarling in a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof on her\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for shame, Totty! Little gells o\xe2\x80\x99 five year old should be ashamed\r\nto be carried. Why, Adam, she\xe2\x80\x99ll break your arm, such a big gell as\r\nthat; set her down\xe2\x80\x94for shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI can lift her with my hand\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve no need to\r\ntake my arm to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTotty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy,\r\nwas set down at the door-place, and the mother enforced her reproof\r\nwith a shower of kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re surprised to see me at this hour o\xe2\x80\x99 the day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, making way for him; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nbad news, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam answered, as he went up to Dinah and put out\r\nhis hand to her. She had laid down her work and stood up,\r\ninstinctively, as he approached her. A faint blush died away from her\r\npale cheek as she put her hand in his and looked up at him timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an errand to you brought me, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, apparently\r\nunconscious that he was holding her hand all the while; \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x99s a bit\r\nailing, and she\xe2\x80\x99s set her heart on your coming to stay the night with\r\nher, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so kind. I told her I\xe2\x80\x99d call and ask you as I came\r\nfrom the village. She overworks herself, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t persuade her to\r\nhave a little girl t\xe2\x80\x99 help her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam released Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s hand as he ceased speaking, and was expecting an\r\nanswer, but before she had opened her lips Mrs. Poyser said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nthere now! I told you there was folks enow t\xe2\x80\x99 help i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish,\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99out going further off. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Bede getting as old and cas\xe2\x80\x99alty\r\nas can be, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t let anybody but you go a-nigh her hardly. The\r\nfolks at Snowfield have learnt by this time to do better wi\xe2\x80\x99out you nor\r\nshe can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put my bonnet on and set off directly, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything\r\ndone first, Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, folding up her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do want something done. I want you t\xe2\x80\x99 have your tea, child;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all ready\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup, Adam, if y\xe2\x80\x99 arena in too big a\r\nhurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup, please; and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk with Dinah. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nstraight home, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 timber valuations to write out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Adam, lad, are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, entering warm and\r\ncoatless, with the two black-eyed boys behind him, still looking as\r\nmuch like him as two small elephants are like a large one. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got sight o\xe2\x80\x99 you so long before foddering-time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came on an errand for Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got a touch of her\r\nold complaint, and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll spare her for your mother a little while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPoyser. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we wonna spare her for anybody else, on\xe2\x80\x99y her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHusband!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, who was at the most prosaic and literal period\r\nof the boyish mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dinah hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, placing a seed-cake on the table and\r\nthen seating herself to pour out the tea. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must spare her, it\r\nseems, and not for a husband neither, but for her own megrims. Tommy,\r\nwhat are you doing to your little sister\xe2\x80\x99s doll? Making the child\r\nnaughty, when she\xe2\x80\x99d be good if you\xe2\x80\x99d let her. You shanna have a morsel\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 cake if you behave so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by turning\r\nDolly\xe2\x80\x99s skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to\r\nthe general scorn\xe2\x80\x94an indignity which cut Totty to the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s been a-telling me since dinner-time?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPoyser continued, looking at her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor un at guessing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she means to go back to Snowfield again, and work i\xe2\x80\x99 the mill,\r\nand starve herself, as she used to do, like a creatur as has got no\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser did not readily find words to express his unpleasant\r\nastonishment; he only looked from his wife to Dinah, who had now seated\r\nherself beside Totty, as a bulwark against brotherly playfulness, and\r\nwas busying herself with the children\xe2\x80\x99s tea. If he had been given to\r\nmaking general reflections, it would have occurred to him that there\r\nwas certainly a change come over Dinah, for she never used to change\r\ncolour; but, as it was, he merely observed that her face was flushed at\r\nthat moment. Mr. Poyser thought she looked the prettier for it: it was\r\na flush no deeper than the petal of a monthly rose. Perhaps it came\r\nbecause her uncle was looking at her so fixedly; but there is no\r\nknowing, for just then Adam was saying, with quiet surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\r\nhoped Dinah was settled among us for life. I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d given up the\r\nnotion o\xe2\x80\x99 going back to her old country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought! Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cand so would anybody else ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought, as had got their right end up\xe2\x80\x99ards. But I suppose you must\r\n_be_ a Methodist to know what a Methodist \xe2\x80\x99ull do. It\xe2\x80\x99s ill guessing\r\nwhat the bats are flying after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what have we done to you. Dinah, as you must go away from us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Poyser, still pausing over his tea-cup. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like breaking\r\nyour word, welly, for your aunt never had no thought but you\xe2\x80\x99d make\r\nthis your home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, trying to be quite calm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first came,\r\nI said it was only for a time, as long as I could be of any comfort to\r\nmy aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, an\xe2\x80\x99 who said you\xe2\x80\x99d ever left off being a comfort to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you didna mean to stay wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, you\xe2\x80\x99d better never ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncome. Them as ha\xe2\x80\x99 never had a cushion don\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, who objected to exaggerated views. \xe2\x80\x9cThee\r\nmustna say so; we should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been ill off wi\xe2\x80\x99out her, Lady day was a\r\ntwelvemont\xe2\x80\x99. We mun be thankful for that, whether she stays or no. But\r\nI canna think what she mun leave a good home for, to go back int\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\ncountry where the land, most on\xe2\x80\x99t, isna worth ten shillings an acre,\r\nrent and profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the reason she wants to go, as fur as she can give a\r\nreason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says this country\xe2\x80\x99s too comfortable,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s too much t\xe2\x80\x99 eat, an\xe2\x80\x99 folks arena miserable enough. And\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s going next week. I canna turn her, say what I will. It\xe2\x80\x99s allays\r\nthe way wi\xe2\x80\x99 them meek-faced people; you may\xe2\x80\x99s well pelt a bag o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeathers as talk to \xe2\x80\x99em. But I say it isna religion, to be so\r\nobstinate\xe2\x80\x94is it now, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any\r\nmatter relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve her, if possible,\r\nhe said, looking at her affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I can\xe2\x80\x99t find fault with\r\nanything Dinah does. I believe her thoughts are better than our\r\nguesses, let \xe2\x80\x99em be what they may. I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been thankful for her\r\nto stay among us, but if she thinks well to go, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross her,\r\nor make it hard to her by objecting. We owe her something different to\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs it often happens, the words intended to relieve her were just too\r\nmuch for Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s susceptible feelings at this moment. The tears came\r\ninto the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly,\r\nmeaning it to be understood that she was going to put on her bonnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, what\xe2\x80\x99s Dinah crying for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Totty. \xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a naughty\r\ndell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99st gone a bit too fur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve no right t\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterfere with her doing as she likes. An\xe2\x80\x99 thee\xe2\x80\x99dst be as angry as\r\ncould be wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, if I said a word against anything she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99d very like be finding fault wi\xe2\x80\x99out reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPoyser. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s reason i\xe2\x80\x99 what I say, else I shouldna say it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasy talking for them as can\xe2\x80\x99t love her so well as her own aunt does.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 me got so used to her! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared\r\nsheep when she\xe2\x80\x99s gone from me. An\xe2\x80\x99 to think of her leaving a parish\r\nwhere she\xe2\x80\x99s so looked on. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Irwine makes as much of her as if\r\nshe was a lady, for all her being a Methodist, an\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 that maggot o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npreaching in her head\xe2\x80\x94God forgi\xe2\x80\x99e me if I\xe2\x80\x99m i\xe2\x80\x99 the wrong to call it\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; \xe2\x80\x9cbut thee dostna tell Adam what\r\nhe said to thee about it one day. The missis was saying, Adam, as the\r\npreaching was the only fault to be found wi\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah, and Mr. Irwine\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t find fault with her for that, Mrs. Poyser; you\r\nforget she\xe2\x80\x99s got no husband to preach to. I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it, you give\r\nPoyser many a good sermon.\xe2\x80\x99 The parson had thee there,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poyser\r\nadded, laughing unctuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Bartle Massey on it, an\xe2\x80\x99 he laughed\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring at\r\none another with a pipe i\xe2\x80\x99 their mouths,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nBartle Massey his way and he\xe2\x80\x99d have all the sharpness to himself. If\r\nthe chaff-cutter had the making of us, we should all be straw, I\r\nreckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs to cousin Dinah, and see what\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and give her a pretty kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain\r\nthreatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for Tommy, no\r\nlonger expectant of cake, was lifting up his eyelids with his\r\nforefingers and turning his eyeballs towards Totty in a way that she\r\nfelt to be disagreeably personal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re rare and busy now\xe2\x80\x94eh, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cBurge\xe2\x80\x99s getting\r\nso bad wi\xe2\x80\x99 his asthmy, it\xe2\x80\x99s well if he\xe2\x80\x99ll ever do much riding about\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty bit o\xe2\x80\x99 building on hand now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nwith the repairs on th\xe2\x80\x99 estate, and the new houses at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nland is for him and Mary to go to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be for\r\nlaying by business soon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, and be wanting you to take to it\r\nall and pay him so much by th\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ear. We shall see you living on th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhill before another twelvemont\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like t\xe2\x80\x99 have the business in my own hands.\r\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as I mind much about getting any more money. We\xe2\x80\x99ve enough and\r\nto spare now, with only our two selves and mother; but I should like t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhave my own way about things\xe2\x80\x94I could try plans then, as I can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get on pretty well wi\xe2\x80\x99 the new steward, I reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPoyser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; he\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible man enough; understands farming\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarrying on the draining, and all that, capital. You must go some day\r\ntowards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations they\xe2\x80\x99re making.\r\nBut he\xe2\x80\x99s got no notion about buildings. You can so seldom get hold of a\r\nman as can turn his brains to more nor one thing; it\xe2\x80\x99s just as if they\r\nwore blinkers like th\xe2\x80\x99 horses and could see nothing o\xe2\x80\x99 one side of \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Irwine has got notions o\xe2\x80\x99 building more nor most\r\narchitects; for as for th\xe2\x80\x99 architects, they set up to be fine fellows,\r\nbut the most of \xe2\x80\x99em don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to set a chimney so as it shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe quarrelling with a door. My notion is, a practical builder that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 taste makes the best architect for common things; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nten times the pleasure i\xe2\x80\x99 seeing after the work when I\xe2\x80\x99ve made the plan\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s discourse on\r\nbuilding, but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his\r\ncorn-rick had been proceeding a little too long without the control of\r\nthe master\xe2\x80\x99s eye, for when Adam had done speaking, he got up and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lad, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bid you good-bye now, for I\xe2\x80\x99m off to the rick-yard\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam rose too, for he saw Dinah entering, with her bonnet on and a\r\nlittle basket in her hand, preceded by Totty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ready, I see, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said; \xe2\x80\x9cso we\xe2\x80\x99ll set off, for the\r\nsooner I\xe2\x80\x99m at home the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Totty, with her treble pipe, \xe2\x80\x9cDinah was saying her\r\nprayers and crying ever so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, \xe2\x80\x9clittle gells mustn\xe2\x80\x99t chatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the\r\nwhite deal table and desired her to kiss him. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, you\r\nperceive, had no correct principles of education.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPoyser: \xe2\x80\x9cbut you can stay, you know, if she\xe2\x80\x99s ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L\r\nIn the Cottage\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam did not ask Dinah to take his arm when they got out into the lane.\r\nHe had never yet done so, often as they had walked together, for he had\r\nobserved that she never walked arm-in-arm with Seth, and he thought,\r\nperhaps, that kind of support was not agreeable to her. So they walked\r\napart, though side by side, and the close poke of her little black\r\nbonnet hid her face from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy, then, to make the Hall Farm your home, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAdam said, with the quiet interest of a brother, who has no anxiety for\r\nhimself in the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, seeing they\xe2\x80\x99re so fond of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Adam, my heart is as their heart, so far as love for them\r\nand care for their welfare goes, but they are in no present need. Their\r\nsorrows are healed, and I feel that I am called back to my old work, in\r\nwhich I found a blessing that I have missed of late in the midst of too\r\nabundant worldly good. I know it is a vain thought to flee from the\r\nwork that God appoints us, for the sake of finding a greater blessing\r\nto our own souls, as if we could choose for ourselves where we shall\r\nfind the fulness of the Divine Presence, instead of seeking it where\r\nalone it is to be found, in loving obedience. But now, I believe, I\r\nhave a clear showing that my work lies elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94at least for a time.\r\nIn the years to come, if my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s health should fail, or she should\r\notherwise need me, I shall return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99d go against\r\nthe wishes of them that love you, and are akin to you, without a good\r\nand sufficient reason in your own conscience. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to say\r\nanything about my being sorry: you know well enough what cause I have\r\nto put you above every other friend I\xe2\x80\x99ve got; and if it had been\r\nordered so that you could ha\xe2\x80\x99 been my sister, and lived with us all our\r\nlives, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 counted it the greatest blessing as could happen to\r\nus now. But Seth tells me there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope o\xe2\x80\x99 that: your feelings are\r\ndifferent, and perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m taking too much upon me to speak about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah made no answer, and they walked on in silence for some yards,\r\ntill they came to the stone stile, where, as Adam had passed through\r\nfirst and turned round to give her his hand while she mounted the\r\nunusually high step, she could not prevent him from seeing her face. It\r\nstruck him with surprise, for the grey eyes, usually so mild and grave,\r\nhad the bright uneasy glance which accompanies suppressed agitation,\r\nand the slight flush in her cheeks, with which she had come downstairs,\r\nwas heightened to a deep rose-colour. She looked as if she were only\r\nsister to Dinah. Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some\r\nmoments, and then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve not hurt or displeased you by\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no wish\r\ndifferent from what you see to be best, and I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied for you to\r\nlive thirty mile off, if you think it right. I shall think of you just\r\nas much as I do now, for you\xe2\x80\x99re bound up with what I can no more help\r\nremembering than I can help my heart beating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Adam! Thus do men blunder. Dinah made no answer, but she presently\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard any news from that poor young man, since we last\r\nspoke of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah always called Arthur so; she had never lost the image of him as\r\nshe had seen him in the prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Irwine read me part of a letter from him\r\nyesterday. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty certain, they say, that there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a peace\r\nsoon, though nobody believes it\xe2\x80\x99ll last long; but he says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to come home. He\xe2\x80\x99s no heart for it yet, and it\xe2\x80\x99s better for others\r\nthat he should keep away. Mr. Irwine thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s in the right not to\r\ncome. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sorrowful letter. He asks about you and the Poysers, as he\r\nalways does. There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing in the letter cut me a good deal: \xe2\x80\x98You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think what an old fellow I feel,\xe2\x80\x99 he says; \xe2\x80\x98I make no schemes\r\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99m the best when I\xe2\x80\x99ve a good day\xe2\x80\x99s march or fighting before me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s of a rash, warm-hearted nature, like Esau, for whom I have always\r\nfelt great pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cThat meeting between the brothers, where\r\nEsau is so loving and generous, and Jacob so timid and distrustful,\r\nnotwithstanding his sense of the Divine favour, has always touched me\r\ngreatly. Truly, I have been tempted sometimes to say that Jacob was of\r\na mean spirit. But that is our trial: we must learn to see the good in\r\nthe midst of much that is unlovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI like to read about Moses best, in th\xe2\x80\x99 Old\r\nTestament. He carried a hard business well through, and died when other\r\nfolks were going to reap the fruits. A man must have courage to look at\r\nhis life so, and think what\xe2\x80\x99ll come of it after he\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone. A\r\ngood solid bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work lasts: if it\xe2\x80\x99s only laying a floor down,\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s the better for it being done well, besides the man as does\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal, and in\r\nthis way they went on till they passed the bridge across the Willow\r\nBrook, when Adam turned round and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, here\xe2\x80\x99s Seth. I thought\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be home soon. Does he know of you\xe2\x80\x99re going, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I told him last Sabbath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday\r\nevening, a circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late,\r\nfor the happiness he had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have\r\noutweighed the pain of knowing she would never marry him. This evening\r\nhe had his habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment, until he came\r\nquite close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her delicate\r\neyelids and eyelashes. He gave one rapid glance at his brother, but\r\nAdam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had shaken\r\nDinah: he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm. Seth tried not to\r\nlet Dinah see that he had noticed her face, and only said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthankful you\xe2\x80\x99re come, Dinah, for Mother\xe2\x80\x99s been hungering after the\r\nsight of you all day. She began to talk of you the first thing in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the cottage, Lisbeth was seated in her arm-chair, too\r\ntired with setting out the evening meal, a task she always performed a\r\nlong time beforehand, to go and meet them at the door as usual, when\r\nshe heard the approaching footsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoom, child, thee\xe2\x80\x99t coom at last,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when Dinah went towards\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost mane by lavin\xe2\x80\x99 me a week an\xe2\x80\x99 ne\xe2\x80\x99er coomin\xe2\x80\x99 a-nigh me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, taking her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not well. If I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nknown it sooner, I\xe2\x80\x99d have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how\xe2\x80\x99s thee t\xe2\x80\x99 know if thee dostna coom? Th\xe2\x80\x99 lads on\xe2\x80\x99y know what I\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99em. As long as ye can stir hand and foot the men think ye\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhearty. But I\xe2\x80\x99m none so bad, on\xe2\x80\x99y a bit of a cold sets me achin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 lads tease me so t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 somebody wi\xe2\x80\x99 me t\xe2\x80\x99 do the work\xe2\x80\x94they make me\r\nache worse wi\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99. If thee\xe2\x80\x99dst come and stay wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, they\xe2\x80\x99d let me\r\nalone. The Poysers canna want thee so bad as I do. But take thy bonnet\r\noff, an\xe2\x80\x99 let me look at thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah was moving away, but Lisbeth held her fast, while she was taking\r\noff her bonnet, and looked at her face as one looks into a newly\r\ngathered snowdrop, to renew the old impressions of purity and\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, in astonishment; \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nbeen a-cryin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a grief that\xe2\x80\x99ll pass away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, who did not wish\r\njust now to call forth Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances by disclosing her\r\nintention to leave Hayslope. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know about it shortly\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntalk of it to-night. I shall stay with you to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth was pacified by this prospect. And she had the whole evening to\r\ntalk with Dinah alone; for there was a new room in the cottage, you\r\nremember, built nearly two years ago, in the expectation of a new\r\ninmate; and here Adam always sat when he had writing to do or plans to\r\nmake. Seth sat there too this evening, for he knew his mother would\r\nlike to have Dinah all to herself.\r\n\r\nThere were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the\r\ncottage. On one side there was the broad-shouldered, large-featured,\r\nhardy old woman, in her blue jacket and buff kerchief, with her\r\ndim-eyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face and the\r\nslight form in the black dress that were either moving lightly about in\r\nhelpful activity, or seated close by the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair, holding\r\nher withered hand, with eyes lifted up towards her to speak a language\r\nwhich Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the hymn-book.\r\nShe would scarcely listen to reading at all to-night. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, shut\r\nthe book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mun talk. I want t\xe2\x80\x99 know what thee was cryin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout. Hast got troubles o\xe2\x80\x99 thy own, like other folks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each\r\nother in the midst of their unlikeness: Adam with knit brows, shaggy\r\nhair, and dark vigorous colour, absorbed in his \xe2\x80\x9cfiguring\xe2\x80\x9d; Seth, with\r\nlarge rugged features, the close copy of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s, but with thin,\r\nwavy, brown hair and blue dreamy eyes, as often as not looking vaguely\r\nout of the window instead of at his book, although it was a newly\r\nbought book\xe2\x80\x94Wesley\xe2\x80\x99s abridgment of Madame Guyon\xe2\x80\x99s life, which was full\r\nof wonder and interest for him. Seth had said to Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help thee\r\nwith anything in here to-night? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a noise in the\r\nshop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but what I must do myself.\r\nThee\xe2\x80\x99st got thy new book to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd often, when Seth was quite unconscious, Adam, as he paused after\r\ndrawing a line with his ruler, looked at his brother with a kind smile\r\ndawning in his eyes. He knew \xe2\x80\x9cth\xe2\x80\x99 lad liked to sit full o\xe2\x80\x99 thoughts he\r\ncould give no account of; they\xe2\x80\x99d never come t\xe2\x80\x99 anything, but they made\r\nhim happy,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the last year or so, Adam had been getting more and\r\nmore indulgent to Seth. It was part of that growing tenderness which\r\ncame from the sorrow at work within him.\r\n\r\nFor Adam, though you see him quite master of himself, working hard and\r\ndelighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature, had not\r\noutlived his sorrow\xe2\x80\x94had not felt it slip from him as a temporary\r\nburden, and leave him the same man again. Do any of us? God forbid. It\r\nwould be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won\r\nnothing but our old selves at the end of it\xe2\x80\x94if we could return to the\r\nsame blind loves, the same self-confident blame, the same light\r\nthoughts of human suffering, the same frivolous gossip over blighted\r\nhuman lives, the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we\r\nhave sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness. Let us rather be\r\nthankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only\r\nchanging its form, as forces do, and passing from pain into\r\nsympathy\xe2\x80\x94the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our\r\nbest love. Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had\r\ncompletely taken place in Adam yet. There was still a great remnant of\r\npain, and this he felt would subsist as long as _her_ pain was not a\r\nmemory, but an existing thing, which he must think of as renewed with\r\nthe light of every new morning. But we get accustomed to mental as well\r\nas bodily pain, without, for all that, losing our sensibility to it. It\r\nbecomes a habit of our lives, and we cease to imagine a condition of\r\nperfect ease as possible for us. Desire is chastened into submission,\r\nand we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our\r\ngrief in silence and act as if we were not suffering. For it is at such\r\nperiods that the sense of our lives having visible and invisible\r\nrelations, beyond any of which either our present or prospective self\r\nis the centre, grows like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and\r\nexert.\r\n\r\nThat was Adam\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His\r\nwork, as you know, had always been part of his religion, and from very\r\nearly days he saw clearly that good carpentry was God\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94was that\r\nform of God\xe2\x80\x99s will that most immediately concerned him. But now there\r\nwas no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality, no\r\nholiday-time in the working-day world, no moment in the distance when\r\nduty would take off her iron glove and breast-plate and clasp him\r\ngently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one made up\r\nof hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment\r\nand intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he thought, could\r\nnever be anything to him but a living memory\xe2\x80\x94a limb lopped off, but not\r\ngone from consciousness. He did not know that the power of loving was\r\nall the while gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities\r\nbought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was\r\npossible, nay, necessary to him, that his nature should intertwine with\r\nanother. Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were\r\nmore precious to him than they used to be\xe2\x80\x94that he clung more to his\r\nmother and Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or\r\nimagination of any small addition to their happiness. The Poysers,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94hardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing\r\nthem and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them. He\r\nwould have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had not been with them,\r\nbut he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put\r\nher above all other friends in the world. Could anything be more\r\nnatural? For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always\r\ncame as the first ray of returning comfort. The early days of gloom at\r\nthe Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her\r\npresence; and in the cottage, too, for she had come at every spare\r\nmoment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been stricken with a\r\nfear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her darling\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s grief-worn face. He had become used to watching her light quiet\r\nmovements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the\r\nHall Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think\r\neverything she said and did was just right, and could not have been\r\nbetter. In spite of his wisdom, he could not find fault with her for\r\nher overindulgence of the children, who had managed to convert Dinah\r\nthe preacher, before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a\r\nlittle, into a convenient household slave\xe2\x80\x94though Dinah herself was\r\nrather ashamed of this weakness, and had some inward conflict as to her\r\ndeparture from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there was one thing that\r\nmight have been better; she might have loved Seth and consented to\r\nmarry him. He felt a little vexed, for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and he could\r\nnot help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Seth\xe2\x80\x99s wife, would have\r\nmade their home as happy as it could be for them all\xe2\x80\x94how she was the\r\none being that would have soothed their mother\xe2\x80\x99s last days into\r\npeacefulness and rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love th\xe2\x80\x99 lad,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam had said sometimes to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cfor anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think he was just cut out for her. But her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s so taken up with other things. She\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 those women that\r\nfeel no drawing towards having a husband and children o\xe2\x80\x99 their own. She\r\nthinks she should be filled up with her own life then, and she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nused so to living in other folks\xe2\x80\x99s cares, she can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the thought of\r\nher heart being shut up from \xe2\x80\x99em. I see how it is, well enough. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncut out o\xe2\x80\x99 different stuff from most women: I saw that long ago. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever easy but when she\xe2\x80\x99s helping somebody, and marriage \xe2\x80\x99ud interfere\r\nwith her ways\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to be contriving and thinking\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud be better if she\xe2\x80\x99d have Seth, as if I was wiser than she is\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nthan God either, for He made her what she is, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ngreatest blessings I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had from His hands, and others besides\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis self-reproof had recurred strongly to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mind when he gathered\r\nfrom Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that\r\nshe had accepted Seth, and so he had endeavoured to put into the\r\nstrongest words his confidence in her decision as right\xe2\x80\x94his resignation\r\neven to her going away from them and ceasing to make part of their life\r\notherwise than by living in their thoughts, if that separation were\r\nchosen by herself. He felt sure she knew quite well enough how much he\r\ncared to see her continually\xe2\x80\x94to talk to her with the silent\r\nconsciousness of a mutual great remembrance. It was not possible she\r\nshould hear anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his\r\nassurance that he was contented for her to go away; and yet there\r\nremained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the\r\nright thing\xe2\x80\x94that, somehow, Dinah had not understood him.\r\n\r\nDinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning, for she\r\nwas downstairs about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. So was Seth, for, through Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobstinate refusal to have any woman-helper in the house, he had learned\r\nto make himself, as Adam said, \xe2\x80\x9cvery handy in the housework,\xe2\x80\x9d that he\r\nmight save his mother from too great weariness; on which ground I hope\r\nyou will not think him unmanly, any more than you can have thought the\r\ngallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid\r\nsister. Adam, who had sat up late at his writing, was still asleep, and\r\nwas not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time. Often as\r\nDinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months, she had\r\nnever slept in the cottage since that night after Thias\xe2\x80\x99s death, when,\r\nyou remember, Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a\r\nmodified approval to her porridge. But in that long interval Dinah had\r\nmade great advances in household cleverness, and this morning, since\r\nSeth was there to help, she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch\r\nof cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser. The\r\ncottage was far from that standard at present, for Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s rheumatism\r\nhad forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and\r\npolishing. When the kitchen was to her mind, Dinah went into the new\r\nroom, where Adam had been writing the night before, to see what\r\nsweeping and dusting were needed there. She opened the window and let\r\nin the fresh morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the\r\nbright low-slanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her\r\npale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush, and swept,\r\nsinging to herself in a very low tone\xe2\x80\x94like a sweet summer murmur that\r\nyou have to listen for very closely\xe2\x80\x94one of Charles Wesley\xe2\x80\x99s hymns:\r\n\r\nEternal Beam of Light Divine,\r\n    Fountain of unexhausted love,\r\nIn whom the Father\xe2\x80\x99s glories shine,\r\n    Through earth beneath and heaven above;\r\n\r\nJesus! the weary wanderer\xe2\x80\x99s rest,\r\n    Give me thy easy yoke to bear;\r\nWith steadfast patience arm my breast,\r\n    With spotless love and holy fear.\r\n\r\nSpeak to my warring passions, \xe2\x80\x9cPeace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    Say to my trembling heart, \xe2\x80\x9cBe still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThy power my strength and fortress is,\r\n    For all things serve thy sovereign will.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe laid by the brush and took up the duster; and if you had ever lived\r\nin Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s household, you would know how the duster behaved in\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s hand\xe2\x80\x94how it went into every small corner, and on every ledge in\r\nand out of sight\xe2\x80\x94how it went again and again round every bar of the\r\nchairs, and every leg, and under and over everything that lay on the\r\ntable, till it came to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s papers and rulers and the open desk near\r\nthem. Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated,\r\nlooking at them with a longing but timid eye. It was painful to see how\r\nmuch dust there was among them. As she was looking in this way, she\r\nheard Seth\xe2\x80\x99s step just outside the open door, towards which her back\r\nwas turned, and said, raising her clear treble, \xe2\x80\x9cSeth, is your brother\r\nwrathful when his papers are stirred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very, when they are not put back in the right places,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\ndeep strong voice, not Seth\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIt was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord. She\r\nwas shaken with an intense thrill, and for the instant felt nothing\r\nelse; then she knew her cheeks were glowing, and dared not look round,\r\nbut stood still, distressed because she could not say good-morning in a\r\nfriendly way. Adam, finding that she did not look round so as to see\r\nthe smile on his face, was afraid she had thought him serious about his\r\nwrathfulness, and went up to her, so that she was obliged to look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You think I\xe2\x80\x99m a cross fellow at home, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsmilingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, looking up with timid eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cnot so. But you might\r\nbe put about by finding things meddled with; and even the man Moses,\r\nthe meekest of men, was wrathful sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, looking at her affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you\r\nmove the things, and put \xe2\x80\x99em back again, and then they can\xe2\x80\x99t get wrong.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting to be your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s own niece, I see, for particularness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began their little task together, but Dinah had not recovered\r\nherself sufficiently to think of any remark, and Adam looked at her\r\nuneasily. Dinah, he thought, had seemed to disapprove him somehow\r\nlately; she had not been so kind and open to him as she used to be. He\r\nwanted her to look at him, and be as pleased as he was himself with\r\ndoing this bit of playful work. But Dinah did not look at him\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\neasy for her to avoid looking at the tall man\xe2\x80\x94and when at last there\r\nwas no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to linger\r\nnear her, he could bear it no longer, and said, in rather a pleading\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cDinah, you\xe2\x80\x99re not displeased with me for anything, are you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot said or done anything to make you think ill of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question surprised her, and relieved her by giving a new course to\r\nher feeling. She looked up at him now, quite earnestly, almost with the\r\ntears coming, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, Adam! how could you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the value I set on the very\r\nthought of you, Dinah. That was what I meant yesterday, when I said I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe content for you to go, if you thought right. I meant, the thought of\r\nyou was worth so much to me, I should feel I ought to be thankful, and\r\nnot grumble, if you see right to go away. You know I do mind parting\r\nwith you, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak calmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you have a brother\xe2\x80\x99s heart towards me, and we shall often be\r\nwith one another in spirit; but at this season I am in heaviness\r\nthrough manifold temptations. You must not mark me. I feel called to\r\nleave my kindred for a while; but it is a trial\xe2\x80\x94the flesh is weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hurt you by talking about it, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if Seth\xe2\x80\x99s ready with breakfast now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is a simple scene, reader. But it is almost certain that you, too,\r\nhave been in love\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, even, more than once, though you may not\r\nchoose to say so to all your feminine friends. If so, you will no more\r\nthink the slight words, the timid looks, the tremulous touches, by\r\nwhich two human souls approach each other gradually, like two little\r\nquivering rain-streams, before they mingle into one\xe2\x80\x94you will no more\r\nthink these things trivial than you will think the first-detected signs\r\nof coming spring trivial, though they be but a faint indescribable\r\nsomething in the air and in the song of the birds, and the tiniest\r\nperceptible budding on the hedge-row branches. Those slight words and\r\nlooks and touches are part of the soul\xe2\x80\x99s language; and the finest\r\nlanguage, I believe, is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clight,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csound,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstars,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmusic\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94words really not worth looking at,\r\nor hearing, in themselves, any more than \xe2\x80\x9cchips\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csawdust.\xe2\x80\x9d It is\r\nonly that they happen to be the signs of something unspeakably great\r\nand beautiful. I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing\r\ntoo, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be\r\nchips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmusic,\xe2\x80\x9d stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory\r\nand enriching your present with your most precious past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI\r\nSunday Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nLisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s touch of rheumatism could not be made to appear serious\r\nenough to detain Dinah another night from the Hall Farm, now she had\r\nmade up her mind to leave her aunt so soon, and at evening the friends\r\nmust part. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah had said, for she had told Lisbeth\r\nof her resolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99ll be for all my life, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shall ne\xe2\x80\x99er see thee again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLisbeth. \xe2\x80\x9cLong while! I\xe2\x80\x99n got no long while t\xe2\x80\x99 live. An\xe2\x80\x99 I shall be\r\ntook bad an\xe2\x80\x99 die, an\xe2\x80\x99 thee canst ne\xe2\x80\x99er come a-nigh me, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shall die\r\na-longing for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat had been the key-note of her wailing talk all day; for Adam was\r\nnot in the house, and so she put no restraint on her complaining. She\r\nhad tried poor Dinah by returning again and again to the question, why\r\nshe must go away; and refusing to accept reasons, which seemed to her\r\nnothing but whim and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrairiness\xe2\x80\x9d; and still more, by regretting\r\nthat she \xe2\x80\x9ccouldna\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 one o\xe2\x80\x99 the lads\xe2\x80\x9d and be her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee couldstna put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isna cliver enough for\r\nthee, happen, but he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been very good t\xe2\x80\x99 thee\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s as handy as can\r\nbe at doin\xe2\x80\x99 things for me when I\xe2\x80\x99m bad, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s as fond o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 chappellin\xe2\x80\x99 as thee art thysen. But happen, thee\xe2\x80\x99dst like a husband\r\nbetter as isna just the cut o\xe2\x80\x99 thysen: the runnin\xe2\x80\x99 brook isna athirst\r\nfor th\xe2\x80\x99 rain. Adam \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 done for thee\xe2\x80\x94I know he would\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 he might\r\ncome t\xe2\x80\x99 like thee well enough, if thee\xe2\x80\x99dst stop. But he\xe2\x80\x99s as stubborn\r\nas th\xe2\x80\x99 iron bar\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no bending him no way but\xe2\x80\x99s own. But he\xe2\x80\x99d be a\r\nfine husband for anybody, be they who they will, so looked-on an\xe2\x80\x99 so\r\ncliver as he is. And he\xe2\x80\x99d be rare an\xe2\x80\x99 lovin\xe2\x80\x99: it does me good on\xe2\x80\x99y a\r\nlook o\xe2\x80\x99 the lad\xe2\x80\x99s eye when he means kind tow\xe2\x80\x99rt me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah tried to escape from Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s closest looks and questions by\r\nfinding little tasks of housework that kept her moving about, and as\r\nsoon as Seth came home in the evening she put on her bonnet to go. It\r\ntouched Dinah keenly to say the last good-bye, and still more to look\r\nround on her way across the fields and see the old woman still standing\r\nat the door, gazing after her till she must have been the faintest\r\nspeck in the dim aged eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe God of love and peace be with them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDinah prayed, as she looked back from the last stile. \xe2\x80\x9cMake them glad\r\naccording to the days wherein thou hast afflicted them, and the years\r\nwherein they have seen evil. It is thy will that I should part from\r\nthem; let me have no will but thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth turned into the house at last and sat down in the workshop near\r\nSeth, who was busying himself there with fitting some bits of turned\r\nwood he had brought from the village into a small work-box, which he\r\nmeant to give to Dinah before she went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99t see her again o\xe2\x80\x99 Sunday afore she goes,\xe2\x80\x9d were her first words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thee wast good for anything, thee\xe2\x80\x99dst make her come in again o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSunday night wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee, and see me once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cDinah \xe2\x80\x99ud be sure to come again if she saw\r\nright to come. I should have no need to persuade her. She only thinks\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud be troubling thee for nought, just to come in to say good-bye\r\nover again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er go away, I know, if Adam \xe2\x80\x99ud be fond on her an\xe2\x80\x99 marry her,\r\nbut everything\xe2\x80\x99s so contrairy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, with a burst of vexation.\r\n\r\nSeth paused a moment and looked up, with a slight blush, at his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Has she said anything o\xe2\x80\x99 that sort to thee,\r\nMother?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a lower tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid? Nay, she\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothin\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y the men as have to wait till\r\nfolks say things afore they find \xe2\x80\x99em out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but what makes thee think so, Mother? What\xe2\x80\x99s put it into thy\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no matter what\xe2\x80\x99s put it into my head. My head\xe2\x80\x99s none so hollow as\r\nit must get in, an\xe2\x80\x99 nought to put it there. I know she\xe2\x80\x99s fond on him,\r\nas I know th\xe2\x80\x99 wind\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 in at the door, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s anoof. An\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nmight be willin\xe2\x80\x99 to marry her if he know\xe2\x80\x99d she\xe2\x80\x99s fond on him, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nne\xe2\x80\x99er think on\xe2\x80\x99t if somebody doesna put it into\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion about Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s feeling towards Adam was not\r\nquite a new thought to Seth, but her last words alarmed him, lest she\r\nshould herself undertake to open Adam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He was not sure about\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s feeling, and he thought he _was_ sure about Adam\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cthee mustna think o\xe2\x80\x99 speaking\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 such things to Adam. Thee\xe2\x80\x99st no right to say what Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nare if she hasna told thee, and it \xe2\x80\x99ud do nothing but mischief to say\r\nsuch things to Adam. He feels very grateful and affectionate toward\r\nDinah, but he\xe2\x80\x99s no thoughts towards her that \xe2\x80\x99ud incline him to make\r\nher his wife, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Dinah \xe2\x80\x99ud marry him either. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cThee think\xe2\x80\x99st so \xe2\x80\x99cause she wouldna\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 thee. She\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er marry thee; thee mightst as well like her t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthy brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth was hurt. \xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a remonstrating tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthat of me. I should be as thankful t\xe2\x80\x99 have her for a sister as thee\r\nwouldst t\xe2\x80\x99 have her for a daughter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more thoughts about myself\r\nin that thing, and I shall take it hard if ever thee say\xe2\x80\x99st it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, then thee shouldstna cross me wi\xe2\x80\x99 sayin\xe2\x80\x99 things arena as I\r\nsay they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x99dst be doing Dinah a wrong by telling\r\nAdam what thee think\xe2\x80\x99st about her. It \xe2\x80\x99ud do nothing but mischief, for\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud make Adam uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her. And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npretty sure he feels nothing o\xe2\x80\x99 the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, donna tell me what thee\xe2\x80\x99t sure on; thee know\xe2\x80\x99st nought about it.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he allays goin\xe2\x80\x99 to the Poysers\xe2\x80\x99 for, if he didna want t\xe2\x80\x99 see\r\nher? He goes twice where he used t\xe2\x80\x99 go once. Happen he knowsna as he\r\nwants t\xe2\x80\x99 see her; he knowsna as I put salt in\xe2\x80\x99s broth, but he\xe2\x80\x99d miss it\r\npretty quick if it warna there. He\xe2\x80\x99ll ne\xe2\x80\x99er think o\xe2\x80\x99 marrying if it\r\nisna put into\xe2\x80\x99s head, an\xe2\x80\x99 if thee\xe2\x80\x99dst any love for thy mother, thee\xe2\x80\x99dst\r\nput him up to\xe2\x80\x99t an\xe2\x80\x99 not let her go away out o\xe2\x80\x99 my sight, when I might\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 her to make a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 comfort for me afore I go to bed to my old man\r\nunder the white thorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cthee mustna think me unkind, but I should be\r\ngoing against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings are. And besides that, I think I should give offence to Adam\r\nby speaking to him at all about marrying; and I counsel thee not to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x99t. Thee may\xe2\x80\x99st be quite deceived about Dinah. Nay, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure,\r\nby words she said to me last Sabbath, as she\xe2\x80\x99s no mind to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, thee\xe2\x80\x99t as contrairy as the rest on \xe2\x80\x99em. If it war summat I didna\r\nwant, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be done fast enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLisbeth rose from the bench at this, and went out of the workshop,\r\nleaving Seth in much anxiety lest she should disturb Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mind about\r\nDinah. He consoled himself after a time with reflecting that, since\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, Lisbeth had been very timid about speaking to him on\r\nmatters of feeling, and that she would hardly dare to approach this\r\ntenderest of all subjects. Even if she did, he hoped Adam would not\r\ntake much notice of what she said.\r\n\r\nSeth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in restraint by\r\ntimidity, and during the next three days, the intervals in which she\r\nhad an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause\r\nher any strong temptation. But in her long solitary hours she brooded\r\nover her regretful thoughts about Dinah, till they had grown very near\r\nthat point of unmanageable strength when thoughts are apt to take wing\r\nout of their secret nest in a startling manner. And on Sunday morning,\r\nwhen Seth went away to chapel at Treddleston, the dangerous opportunity\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nSunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth, for as\r\nthere was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon, Adam was\r\nalways at home, doing nothing but reading, an occupation in which she\r\ncould venture to interrupt him. Moreover, she had always a better\r\ndinner than usual to prepare for her sons\xe2\x80\x94very frequently for Adam and\r\nherself alone, Seth being often away the entire day\xe2\x80\x94and the smell of\r\nthe roast meat before the clear fire in the clean kitchen, the clock\r\nticking in a peaceful Sunday manner, her darling Adam seated near her\r\nin his best clothes, doing nothing very important, so that she could go\r\nand stroke her hand across his hair if she liked, and see him look up\r\nat her and smile, while Gyp, rather jealous, poked his muzzle up\r\nbetween them\xe2\x80\x94all these things made poor Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s earthly paradise.\r\n\r\nThe book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his large\r\npictured Bible, and this morning it lay open before him on the round\r\nwhite deal table in the kitchen; for he sat there in spite of the fire,\r\nbecause he knew his mother liked to have him with her, and it was the\r\nonly day in the week when he could indulge her in that way. You would\r\nhave liked to see Adam reading his Bible. He never opened it on a\r\nweekday, and so he came to it as a holiday book, serving him for\r\nhistory, biography, and poetry. He held one hand thrust between his\r\nwaistcoat buttons, and the other ready to turn the pages, and in the\r\ncourse of the morning you would have seen many changes in his face.\r\nSometimes his lips moved in semi-articulation\xe2\x80\x94it was when he came to a\r\nspeech that he could fancy himself uttering, such as Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s dying\r\nspeech to the people; then his eyebrows would be raised, and the\r\ncorners of his mouth would quiver a little with sad sympathy\xe2\x80\x94something,\r\nperhaps old Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with his son, touched him closely; at other\r\ntimes, over the New Testament, a very solemn look would come upon his\r\nface, and he would every now and then shake his head in serious assent,\r\nor just lift up his hand and let it fall again. And on some mornings,\r\nwhen he read in the Apocrypha, of which he was very fond, the son of\r\nSirach\xe2\x80\x99s keen-edged words would bring a delighted smile, though he also\r\nenjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal\r\nwriter. For Adam knew the Articles quite well, as became a good\r\nchurchman.\r\n\r\nLisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her dinner, always sat opposite\r\nto him and watched him, till she could rest no longer without going up\r\nto him and giving him a caress, to call his attention to her. This\r\nmorning he was reading the Gospel according to St. Matthew, and Lisbeth\r\nhad been standing close by him for some minutes, stroking his hair,\r\nwhich was smoother than usual this morning, and looking down at the\r\nlarge page with silent wonderment at the mystery of letters. She was\r\nencouraged to continue this caress, because when she first went up to\r\nhim, he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at her\r\naffectionately and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mother, thee look\xe2\x80\x99st rare and hearty this\r\nmorning. Eh, Gyp wants me t\xe2\x80\x99 look at him. He can\xe2\x80\x99t abide to think I\r\nlove thee the best.\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth said nothing, because she wanted to say so\r\nmany things. And now there was a new leaf to be turned over, and it was\r\na picture\xe2\x80\x94that of the angel seated on the great stone that has been\r\nrolled away from the sepulchre. This picture had one strong association\r\nin Lisbeth\xe2\x80\x99s memory, for she had been reminded of it when she first saw\r\nDinah, and Adam had no sooner turned the page, and lifted the book\r\nsideways that they might look at the angel, than she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam smiled, and, looking more intently at the angel\xe2\x80\x99s face, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ a bit like her; but Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s prettier, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if thee think\xe2\x80\x99st her so pretty, why arn\xe2\x80\x99t fond on her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam looked up in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mother, dost think I don\xe2\x80\x99t set store\r\nby Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, frightened at her own courage, yet feeling that\r\nshe had broken the ice, and the waters must flow, whatever mischief\r\nthey might do. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 use o\xe2\x80\x99 settin\xe2\x80\x99 store by things as are thirty\r\nmile off? If thee wast fond enough on her, thee wouldstna let her go\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right t\xe2\x80\x99 hinder her, if she thinks well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam,\r\nlooking at his book as if he wanted to go on reading. He foresaw a\r\nseries of complaints tending to nothing. Lisbeth sat down again in the\r\nchair opposite to him, as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy.\xe2\x80\x9d Lisbeth dared\r\nnot venture beyond a vague phrase yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContrairy, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, looking up again in some anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave I done? What dost mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thee\xe2\x80\x99t never look at nothin\xe2\x80\x99, nor think o\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99, but thy\r\nfigurin, an\xe2\x80\x99 thy work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, half-crying. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 dost think thee\r\ncanst go on so all thy life, as if thee wast a man cut out o\xe2\x80\x99 timber?\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 what wut do when thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s gone, an\xe2\x80\x99 nobody to take care on thee\r\nas thee gett\xe2\x80\x99st a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 victual comfortable i\xe2\x80\x99 the mornin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hast got i\xe2\x80\x99 thy mind, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, vexed at this\r\nwhimpering. \xe2\x80\x9cI canna see what thee\xe2\x80\x99t driving at. Is there anything I\r\ncould do for thee as I don\xe2\x80\x99t do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, an\xe2\x80\x99 that there is. Thee might\xe2\x80\x99st do as I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 somebody wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme to comfort me a bit, an\xe2\x80\x99 wait on me when I\xe2\x80\x99m bad, an\xe2\x80\x99 be good to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mother, whose fault is it there isna some tidy body i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99 help thee? It isna by my wish as thee hast a stroke o\xe2\x80\x99 work to do.\r\nWe can afford it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve told thee often enough. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a deal better\r\nfor us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 talking o\xe2\x80\x99 tidy bodies, when thee mean\xe2\x80\x99st one o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 wenches out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 village, or somebody from Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on as I ne\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nset eyes on i\xe2\x80\x99 my life? I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner make a shift an\xe2\x80\x99 get into my own\r\ncoffin afore I die, nor ha\xe2\x80\x99 them folks to put me in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was silent, and tried to go on reading. That was the utmost\r\nseverity he could show towards his mother on a Sunday morning. But\r\nLisbeth had gone too far now to check herself, and after scarcely a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s quietness she began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee mightst know well enough who \xe2\x80\x99tis I\xe2\x80\x99d like t\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 me. It isna\r\nmany folks I send for t\xe2\x80\x99 come an\xe2\x80\x99 see me. I reckon. An\xe2\x80\x99 thee\xe2\x80\x99st had the\r\nfetchin\xe2\x80\x99 on her times enow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee mean\xe2\x80\x99st Dinah, Mother, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nsetting thy mind on what can\xe2\x80\x99t be. If Dinah \xe2\x80\x99ud be willing to stay at\r\nHayslope, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely she can come away from her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nwhere they hold her like a daughter, and where she\xe2\x80\x99s more bound than\r\nshe is to us. If it had been so that she could ha\xe2\x80\x99 married Seth, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a great blessing to us, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t have things just as\r\nwe like in this life. Thee must try and make up thy mind to do without\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but I canna ma\xe2\x80\x99 up my mind, when she\xe2\x80\x99s just cut out for thee; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnought shall ma\xe2\x80\x99 me believe as God didna make her an\xe2\x80\x99 send her there o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npurpose for thee. What\xe2\x80\x99s it sinnify about her bein\xe2\x80\x99 a Methody! It \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nhappen wear out on her wi\xe2\x80\x99 marryin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother. He\r\nunderstood now what she had been aiming at from the beginning of the\r\nconversation. It was as unreasonable, impracticable a wish as she had\r\never urged, but he could not help being moved by so entirely new an\r\nidea. The chief point, however, was to chase away the notion from his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s mind as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x99t talking wild. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me hear\r\nthee say such things again. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good talking o\xe2\x80\x99 what can never be.\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s not for marrying; she\xe2\x80\x99s fixed her heart on a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lisbeth, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cvery like she\xe2\x80\x99s none for\r\nmarr\xe2\x80\x99ing, when them as she\xe2\x80\x99d be willin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 marry wonna ax her. I\r\nshouldna ha\xe2\x80\x99 been for marr\xe2\x80\x99ing thy feyther if he\xe2\x80\x99d ne\xe2\x80\x99er axed me; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s as fond o\xe2\x80\x99 thee as e\xe2\x80\x99er I war o\xe2\x80\x99 Thias, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s face, and for a few moments he was not quite\r\nconscious where he was. His mother and the kitchen had vanished for\r\nhim, and he saw nothing but Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s face turned up towards his. It\r\nseemed as if there were a resurrection of his dead joy. But he woke up\r\nvery speedily from that dream (the waking was chill and sad), for it\r\nwould have been very foolish in him to believe his mother\xe2\x80\x99s words\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ncould have no ground for them. He was prompted to express his disbelief\r\nvery strongly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps that he might call forth the proofs, if there\r\nwere any to be offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost say such things for, Mother, when thee\xe2\x80\x99st got no foundation\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x99em? Thee know\xe2\x80\x99st nothing as gives thee a right to say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I knowna nought as gi\xe2\x80\x99es me a right to say as the year\xe2\x80\x99s turned,\r\nfor all I feel it fust thing when I get up i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 morning. She isna\r\nfond o\xe2\x80\x99 Seth, I reckon, is she? She doesna want to marry _him?_ But I\r\ncan see as she doesna behave tow\xe2\x80\x99rt thee as she daes tow\xe2\x80\x99rt Seth. She\r\nmakes no more o\xe2\x80\x99 Seth\xe2\x80\x99s coming a-nigh her nor if he war Gyp, but she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall of a tremble when thee\xe2\x80\x99t a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 down by her at breakfast an\xe2\x80\x99\r\na-looking at her. Thee think\xe2\x80\x99st thy mother knows nought, but she war\r\nalive afore thee wast born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, what else should it mane? It isna hate, I reckon. An\xe2\x80\x99 what should\r\nshe do but love thee? Thee\xe2\x80\x99t made to be loved\xe2\x80\x94for where\xe2\x80\x99s there a\r\nstraighter cliverer man? An\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s it sinnify her bein\xe2\x80\x99 a Methody?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y the marigold i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 parridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam had thrust his hands in his pockets, and was looking down at the\r\nbook on the table, without seeing any of the letters. He was trembling\r\nlike a gold-seeker who sees the strong promise of gold but sees in the\r\nsame moment a sickening vision of disappointment. He could not trust\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s insight; she had seen what she wished to see. And yet\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet, now the suggestion had been made to him, he remembered so many\r\nthings, very slight things, like the stirring of the water by an\r\nimperceptible breeze, which seemed to him some confirmation of his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\nLisbeth noticed that he was moved. She went on, \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 thee\xe2\x80\x99t find out as\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x99t poorly aff when she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Thee\xe2\x80\x99t fonder on her nor thee\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99st. Thy eyes follow her about, welly as Gyp\xe2\x80\x99s follow thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam could sit still no longer. He rose, took down his hat, and went\r\nout into the fields.\r\n\r\nThe sunshine was on them: that early autumn sunshine which we should\r\nknow was not summer\xe2\x80\x99s, even if there were not the touches of yellow on\r\nthe lime and chestnut; the Sunday sunshine too, which has more than\r\nautumnal calmness for the working man; the morning sunshine, which\r\nstill leaves the dew-crystals on the fine gossamer webs in the shadow\r\nof the bushy hedgerows.\r\n\r\nAdam needed the calm influence; he was amazed at the way in which this\r\nnew thought of Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s love had taken possession of him, with an\r\novermastering power that made all other feelings give way before the\r\nimpetuous desire to know that the thought was true. Strange, that till\r\nthat moment the possibility of their ever being lovers had never\r\ncrossed his mind, and yet now, all his longing suddenly went out\r\ntowards that possibility. He had no more doubt or hesitation as to his\r\nown wishes than the bird that flies towards the opening through which\r\nthe daylight gleams and the breath of heaven enters.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him, but not by preparing him with\r\nresignation to the disappointment if his mother\xe2\x80\x94if he himself\xe2\x80\x94proved to\r\nbe mistaken about Dinah. It soothed him by gentle encouragement of his\r\nhopes. Her love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make\r\none presence to him, and he believed in them both alike. And Dinah was\r\nso bound up with the sad memories of his first passion that he was not\r\nforsaking them, but rather giving them a new sacredness by loving her.\r\nNay, his love for her had grown out of that past: it was the noon of\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\nBut Seth? Would the lad be hurt? Hardly; for he had seemed quite\r\ncontented of late, and there was no selfish jealousy in him; he had\r\nnever been jealous of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s fondness for Adam. But had _he_ seen\r\nanything of what their mother talked about? Adam longed to know this,\r\nfor he thought he could trust Seth\xe2\x80\x99s observation better than his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s. He must talk to Seth before he went to see Dinah, and, with\r\nthis intention in his mind, he walked back to the cottage and said to\r\nhis mother, \xe2\x80\x9cDid Seth say anything to thee about when he was coming\r\nhome? Will he be back to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, lad, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back for a wonder. He isna gone to Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone somewhere else a-preachin\xe2\x80\x99 and a-prayin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast any notion which way he\xe2\x80\x99s gone?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but he aften goes to th\xe2\x80\x99 Common. Thee know\xe2\x80\x99st more o\xe2\x80\x99s goings nor\r\nI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam wanted to go and meet Seth, but he must content himself with\r\nwalking about the near fields and getting sight of him as soon as\r\npossible. That would not be for more than an hour to come, for Seth\r\nwould scarcely be at home much before their dinner-time, which was\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. But Adam could not sit down to his reading again, and\r\nhe sauntered along by the brook and stood leaning against the stiles,\r\nwith eager intense eyes, which looked as if they saw something very\r\nvividly; but it was not the brook or the willows, not the fields or the\r\nsky. Again and again his vision was interrupted by wonder at the\r\nstrength of his own feeling, at the strength and sweetness of this new\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94almost like the wonder a man feels at the added power he finds in\r\nhimself for an art which he had laid aside for a space. How is it that\r\nthe poets have said so many fine things about our first love, so few\r\nabout our later love? Are their first poems their best? Or are not\r\nthose the best which come from their fuller thought, their larger\r\nexperience, their deeper-rooted affections? The boy\xe2\x80\x99s flutelike voice\r\nhas its own spring charm; but the man should yield a richer deeper\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAt last, there was Seth, visible at the farthest stile, and Adam\r\nhastened to meet him. Seth was surprised, and thought something unusual\r\nmust have happened, but when Adam came up, his face said plainly enough\r\nthat it was nothing alarming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere hast been?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, when they were side by side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Common,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth. \xe2\x80\x9cDinah\xe2\x80\x99s been speaking the Word\r\nto a little company of hearers at Brimstone\xe2\x80\x99s, as they call him.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re folks as never go to church hardly\xe2\x80\x94them on the Common\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll go and hear Dinah a bit. She\xe2\x80\x99s been speaking with power this\r\nforenoon from the words, \xe2\x80\x98I came not to call the righteous, but sinners\r\nto repentance.\xe2\x80\x99 And there was a little thing happened as was pretty to\r\nsee. The women mostly bring their children with \xe2\x80\x99em, but to-day there\r\nwas one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old, that I\r\nnever saw there before. He was as naughty as could be at the beginning\r\nwhile I was praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat down\r\nand Dinah began to speak, th\xe2\x80\x99 young un stood stock still all at once,\r\nand began to look at her with\xe2\x80\x99s mouth open, and presently he ran away\r\nfrom\xe2\x80\x99s mother and went to Dinah, and pulled at her, like a little dog,\r\nfor her to take notice of him. So Dinah lifted him up and held th\xe2\x80\x99 lad\r\non her lap, while she went on speaking; and he was as good as could be\r\ntill he went to sleep\xe2\x80\x94and the mother cried to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she shouldna be a mother herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cso fond as\r\nthe children are of her. Dost think she\xe2\x80\x99s quite fixed against marrying,\r\nSeth? Dost think nothing \xe2\x80\x99ud turn her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something peculiar in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s tone, which made Seth\r\nsteal a glance at his face before he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud be wrong of me to say nothing \xe2\x80\x99ud turn her,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nif thee mean\xe2\x80\x99st it about myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given up all thoughts as she can\r\never be _my_ wife. She calls me her brother, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be\r\nwilling to marry \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam rather shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, after some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s crossed my mind\r\nsometimes o\xe2\x80\x99 late as she might; but Dinah \xe2\x80\x99ud let no fondness for the\r\ncreature draw her out o\xe2\x80\x99 the path as she believed God had marked out\r\nfor her. If she thought the leading was not from Him, she\xe2\x80\x99s not one to\r\nbe brought under the power of it. And she\xe2\x80\x99s allays seemed clear about\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94as her work was to minister t\xe2\x80\x99 others, and make no home for\r\nherself i\xe2\x80\x99 this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose there was a man as \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nlet her do just the same and not interfere with her\xe2\x80\x94she might do a good\r\ndeal o\xe2\x80\x99 what she does now, just as well when she was married as when\r\nshe was single. Other women of her sort have married\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s to say, not\r\njust like her, but women as preached and attended on the sick and\r\nneedy. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Fletcher as she talks of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new light had broken in on Seth. He turned round, and laying his hand\r\non Adam\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, wouldst like her to marry _thee_,\r\nbrother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam looked doubtfully at Seth\xe2\x80\x99s inquiring eyes and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldst be\r\nhurt if she was to be fonder o\xe2\x80\x99 me than o\xe2\x80\x99 thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth warmly, \xe2\x80\x9chow canst think it? Have I felt thy trouble\r\nso little that I shouldna feel thy joy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence a few moments as they walked on, and then Seth said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no notion as thee\xe2\x80\x99dst ever think of her for a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it o\xe2\x80\x99 any use to think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost say?\r\nMother\xe2\x80\x99s made me as I hardly know where I am, with what she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nsaying to me this forenoon. She says she\xe2\x80\x99s sure Dinah feels for me more\r\nthan common, and \xe2\x80\x99ud be willing t\xe2\x80\x99 have me. But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she speaks\r\nwithout book. I want to know if thee\xe2\x80\x99st seen anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nice point to speak about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 being\r\nwrong; besides, we\xe2\x80\x99ve no right t\xe2\x80\x99 intermeddle with people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nwhen they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell \xe2\x80\x99em themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee mightst ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently. \xe2\x80\x9cShe took no offence at\r\n_me_ for asking, and thee\xe2\x80\x99st more right than I had, only thee\xe2\x80\x99t not in\r\nthe Society. But Dinah doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold wi\xe2\x80\x99 them as are for keeping the\r\nSociety so strict to themselves. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind about making folks\r\nenter the Society, so as they\xe2\x80\x99re fit t\xe2\x80\x99 enter the kingdom o\xe2\x80\x99 God. Some\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the brethren at Treddles\xe2\x80\x99on are displeased with her for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will she be the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the farm again to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s her last Sabbath there, and she\xe2\x80\x99s going t\xe2\x80\x99 read out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe big Bible wi\xe2\x80\x99 the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam thought\xe2\x80\x94but did not say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go this afternoon; for if I go\r\nto church, my thoughts \xe2\x80\x99ull be with her all the while. They must sing\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 anthem without me to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII\r\nAdam and Dinah\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Adam entered the farmyard and roused\r\nAlick and the dogs from their Sunday dozing. Alick said everybody was\r\ngone to church \xe2\x80\x9cbut th\xe2\x80\x99 young missis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so he called Dinah\xe2\x80\x94but this did\r\nnot disappoint Adam, although the \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x9d was so liberal as to\r\ninclude Nancy the dairymaid, whose works of necessity were not\r\nunfrequently incompatible with church-going.\r\n\r\nThere was perfect stillness about the house. The doors were all closed,\r\nand the very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual. Adam heard the\r\nwater gently dripping from the pump\xe2\x80\x94that was the only sound\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nknocked at the house door rather softly, as was suitable in that\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Dinah stood before him, colouring deeply with the\r\ngreat surprise of seeing Adam at this hour, when she knew it was his\r\nregular practice to be at church. Yesterday he would have said to her\r\nwithout any difficulty, \xe2\x80\x9cI came to see you, Dinah: I knew the rest were\r\nnot at home.\xe2\x80\x9d But to-day something prevented him from saying that, and\r\nhe put out his hand to her in silence. Neither of them spoke, and yet\r\nboth wished they could speak, as Adam entered, and they sat down. Dinah\r\ntook the chair she had just left; it was at the corner of the table\r\nnear the window, and there was a book lying on the table, but it was\r\nnot open. She had been sitting perfectly still, looking at the small\r\nbit of clear fire in the bright grate. Adam sat down opposite her, in\r\nMr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s three-cornered chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother is not ill again, I hope, Adam?\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said, recovering\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cSeth said she was well this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she\xe2\x80\x99s very hearty to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, happy in the signs of\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s feeling at the sight of him, but shy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody at home, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen hindered from going to church to-day, doubtless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, and then paused, before he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking\r\nabout you: that was the reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis confession was very awkward and sudden, Adam felt, for he thought\r\nDinah must understand all he meant. But the frankness of the words\r\ncaused her immediately to interpret them into a renewal of his\r\nbrotherly regrets that she was going away, and she answered calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nnot be careful and troubled for me, Adam. I have all things and abound\r\nat Snowfield. And my mind is at rest, for I am not seeking my own will\r\nin going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if things were different, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nknew things that perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know now....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah looked at him inquiringly, but instead of going on, he reached a\r\nchair and brought it near the corner of the table where she was\r\nsitting. She wondered, and was afraid\xe2\x80\x94and the next moment her thoughts\r\nflew to the past: was it something about those distant unhappy ones\r\nthat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\r\n\r\nAdam looked at her. It was so sweet to look at her eyes, which had now\r\na self-forgetful questioning in them\xe2\x80\x94for a moment he forgot that he\r\nwanted to say anything, or that it was necessary to tell her what he\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, taking both her hands between his, \xe2\x80\x9cI love\r\nyou with my whole heart and soul. I love you next to God who made me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s lips became pale, like her cheeks, and she trembled violently\r\nunder the shock of painful joy. Her hands were cold as death between\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s. She could not draw them away, because he held them fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you can\xe2\x80\x99t love me, Dinah. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me we must part and\r\npass our lives away from one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears were trembling in Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and they fell before she\r\ncould answer. But she spoke in a quiet low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Adam, we must submit to another Will. We must part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you love me, Dinah\xe2\x80\x94not if you love me,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said passionately.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94tell me if you can love me better than a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to attempt to\r\nachieve any end by a deceptive concealment. She was recovering now from\r\nthe first shock of emotion, and she looked at Adam with simple sincere\r\neyes as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Adam, my heart is drawn strongly towards you;\r\nand of my own will, if I had no clear showing to the contrary, I could\r\nfind my happiness in being near you and ministering to you continually.\r\nI fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others; nay, I fear I\r\nshould forget the Divine presence, and seek no love but yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam did not speak immediately. They sat looking at each other in\r\ndelicious silence\xe2\x80\x94for the first sense of mutual love excludes other\r\nfeelings; it will have the soul all to itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said at last, \xe2\x80\x9chow can there be anything contrary\r\nto what\xe2\x80\x99s right in our belonging to one another and spending our lives\r\ntogether? Who put this great love into our hearts? Can anything be\r\nholier than that? For we can help one another in everything as is good.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d never think o\xe2\x80\x99 putting myself between you and God, and saying you\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do this and you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do that. You\xe2\x80\x99d follow your\r\nconscience as much as you do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know marriage is a holy state for those who\r\nare truly called to it, and have no other drawing; but from my\r\nchildhood upwards I have been led towards another path; all my peace\r\nand my joy have come from having no life of my own, no wants, no wishes\r\nfor myself, and living only in God and those of his creatures whose\r\nsorrows and joys he has given me to know. Those have been very blessed\r\nyears to me, and I feel that if I was to listen to any voice that would\r\ndraw me aside from that path, I should be turning my back on the light\r\nthat has shone upon me, and darkness and doubt would take hold of me.\r\nWe could not bless each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul,\r\nand if I yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which\r\nhad once been given me and I had put away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if you love\r\nme so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat a sign that it\xe2\x80\x99s right for you to change your life? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nlove make it right when nothing else would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now, since you\r\ntell me of your strong love towards me, what was clear to me has become\r\ndark again. I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards\r\nyou, and that your heart was not as mine; and the thought of you had\r\ntaken hold of me, so that my soul had lost its freedom, and was\r\nbecoming enslaved to an earthly affection, which made me anxious and\r\ncareful about what should befall myself. For in all other affection I\r\nhad been content with any small return, or with none; but my heart was\r\nbeginning to hunger after an equal love from you. And I had no doubt\r\nthat I must wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command\r\nwas clear that I must go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better than you\r\nlove me... it\xe2\x80\x99s all different now. You won\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 going. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstay, and be my dear wife, and I shall thank God for giving me my life\r\nas I never thanked him before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to me to turn a deaf ear... you know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard; but a\r\ngreat fear is upon me. It seems to me as if you were stretching out\r\nyour arms to me, and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for\r\nmy own delight, and Jesus, the Man of Sorrows, was standing looking\r\ntowards me, and pointing to the sinful, and suffering, and afflicted. I\r\nhave seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness\r\nand darkness, and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become\r\nhard, and a lover of self, and no more bear willingly the Redeemer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah had closed her eyes, and a faint shudder went through her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t desire that we should seek a good\r\nthrough any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve that could be a good. We are of one mind in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never be the man t\xe2\x80\x99 urge you\r\nagainst your conscience. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t give up the hope that you may come\r\nto see different. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe your loving me could shut up your\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only adding to what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been before, not taking away from\r\nit. For it seems to me it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with love and happiness as with\r\nsorrow\xe2\x80\x94the more we know of it the better we can feel what other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, and wishful to help \xe2\x80\x99em. The more knowledge a man has, the better\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x99s work; and feeling\xe2\x80\x99s a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah was silent; her eyes were fixed in contemplation of something\r\nvisible only to herself. Adam went on presently with his pleading, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou can do almost as much as you do now. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to go to\r\nchurch with me of a Sunday. You shall go where you like among the\r\npeople, and teach \xe2\x80\x99em; for though I like church best, I don\xe2\x80\x99t put my\r\nsoul above yours, as if my words was better for you to follow than your\r\nown conscience. And you can help the sick just as much, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nmore means o\xe2\x80\x99 making \xe2\x80\x99em a bit comfortable; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be among all\r\nyour own friends as love you, and can help \xe2\x80\x99em and be a blessing to \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ntill their dying day. Surely, Dinah, you\xe2\x80\x99d be as near to God as if you\r\nwas living lonely and away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah made no answer for some time. Adam was still holding her hands\r\nand looking at her with almost trembling anxiety, when she turned her\r\ngrave loving eyes on his and said, in rather a sad voice, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam there\r\nis truth in what you say, and there\xe2\x80\x99s many of the brethren and sisters\r\nwho have greater strength than I have, and find their hearts enlarged\r\nby the cares of husband and kindred. But I have not faith that it would\r\nbe so with me, for since my affections have been set above measure on\r\nyou, I have had less peace and joy in God. I have felt as it were a\r\ndivision in my heart. And think how it is with me, Adam. That life I\r\nhave led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my\r\nchildhood; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls\r\nme to another land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul\r\nmight hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken;\r\nand where doubt enters there is not perfect love. I must wait for\r\nclearer guidance. I must go from you, and we must submit ourselves\r\nentirely to the Divine Will. We are sometimes required to lay our\r\nnatural lawful affections on the altar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam dared not plead again, for Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s was not the voice of caprice or\r\ninsincerity. But it was very hard for him; his eyes got dim as he\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you may come to feel satisfied... to feel that you may come to me\r\nagain, and we may never part, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must submit ourselves, Adam. With time, our duty will be made\r\nclear. It may be when I have entered on my former life, I shall find\r\nall these new thoughts and wishes vanish, and become as things that\r\nwere not. Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage.\r\nBut we must wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t love me so well as I love\r\nyou, else you\xe2\x80\x99d have no doubts. But it\xe2\x80\x99s natural you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot so good as you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s right for me to love the best\r\nthing God\xe2\x80\x99s ever given me to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Adam. It seems to me that my love for you is not weak, for my\r\nheart waits on your words and looks, almost as a little child waits on\r\nthe help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends. If the\r\nthought of you took slight hold of me, I should not fear that it would\r\nbe an idol in the temple. But you will strengthen me\xe2\x80\x94you will not\r\nhinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go out into the sunshine, Dinah, and walk together. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak\r\nno word to disturb you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went out and walked towards the fields, where they would meet the\r\nfamily coming from church. Adam said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\ntook it. That was the only change in their manner to each other since\r\nthey were last walking together. But no sadness in the prospect of her\r\ngoing away\xe2\x80\x94in the uncertainty of the issue\xe2\x80\x94could rob the sweetness from\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s sense that Dinah loved him. He thought he would stay at the Hall\r\nFarm all that evening. He would be near her as long as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey-day! There\xe2\x80\x99s Adam along wi\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, as he opened\r\nthe far gate into the Home Close. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldna think how he happened away\r\nfrom church. Why,\xe2\x80\x9d added good Martin, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ndost think has just jumped into my head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummat as hadna far to jump, for it\xe2\x80\x99s just under our nose. You mean as\r\nAdam\xe2\x80\x99s fond o\xe2\x80\x99 Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! hast ever had any notion of it before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, who always declined, if\r\npossible, to be taken by surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not one o\xe2\x80\x99 those as can see the\r\ncat i\xe2\x80\x99 the dairy an\xe2\x80\x99 wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99s come after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee never saidst a word to me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I aren\xe2\x80\x99t like a bird-clapper, forced to make a rattle when the\r\nwind blows on me. I can keep my own counsel when there\xe2\x80\x99s no good i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nspeaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Dinah \xe2\x80\x99ll ha\xe2\x80\x99 none o\xe2\x80\x99 him. Dost think she will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, not sufficiently on her guard against a\r\npossible surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll never marry anybody, if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Methodist\r\nand a cripple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a pretty thing though for \xe2\x80\x99em t\xe2\x80\x99 marry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin,\r\nturning his head on one side, as if in pleased contemplation of his new\r\nidea. \xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99dst ha\xe2\x80\x99 liked it too, wouldstna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I should. I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been sure of her then, as she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\naway from me to Snowfield, welly thirty mile off, and me not got a\r\ncreatur to look to, only neighbours, as are no kin to me, an\xe2\x80\x99 most of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em women as I\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed to show my face, if _my_ dairy things war\r\nlike their\xe2\x80\x99n. There may well be streaky butter i\xe2\x80\x99 the market. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nshould be glad to see the poor thing settled like a Christian woman,\r\nwith a house of her own over her head; and we\xe2\x80\x99d stock her well wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlinen and feathers, for I love her next to my own children. An\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nmakes one feel safer when she\xe2\x80\x99s i\xe2\x80\x99 the house, for she\xe2\x80\x99s like the driven\r\nsnow: anybody might sin for two as had her at their elbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, running forward to meet her, \xe2\x80\x9cmother says you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever marry anybody but a Methodist cripple. What a silly you must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na comment which Tommy followed up by seizing Dinah with both arms, and\r\ndancing along by her side with incommodious fondness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Adam, we missed you i\xe2\x80\x99 the singing to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nwas it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see Dinah\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s going away so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, lad! Can you persuade her to stop somehow? Find her a good husband\r\nsomewhere i\xe2\x80\x99 the parish. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you for\r\nmissing church. But, anyway, she isna going before the harvest supper\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 Wednesday, and you must come then. There\xe2\x80\x99s Bartle Massey comin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhappen Craig. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure an\xe2\x80\x99 come, now, at seven? The missis wunna\r\nhave it a bit later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come if I can. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t often say what I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo beforehand, for the work often holds me longer than I expect. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstay till the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the week, Dinah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have no nay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s no call to be in a hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cScarceness o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvictual \xe2\x80\x99ull keep: there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to be hasty wi\xe2\x80\x99 the cooking. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nscarceness is what there\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest stock of i\xe2\x80\x99 that country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah smiled, but gave no promise to stay, and they talked of other\r\nthings through the rest of the walk, lingering in the sunshine to look\r\nat the great flock of geese grazing, at the new corn-ricks, and at the\r\nsurprising abundance of fruit on the old pear-tree; Nancy and Molly\r\nhaving already hastened home, side by side, each holding, carefully\r\nwrapped in her pocket-handkerchief, a prayer-book, in which she could\r\nread little beyond the large letters and the Amens.\r\n\r\nSurely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through\r\nthe fields from \xe2\x80\x9cafternoon church\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as such walks used to be in those\r\nold leisurely times, when the boat, gliding sleepily along the canal,\r\nwas the newest locomotive wonder; when Sunday books had most of them\r\nold brown-leather covers, and opened with remarkable precision always\r\nin one place. Leisure is gone\xe2\x80\x94gone where the spinning-wheels are gone,\r\nand the pack-horses, and the slow waggons, and the pedlars, who brought\r\nbargains to the door on sunny afternoons. Ingenious philosophers tell\r\nyou, perhaps, that the great work of the steam-engine is to create\r\nleisure for mankind. Do not believe them: it only creates a vacuum for\r\neager thought to rush in. Even idleness is eager now\xe2\x80\x94eager for\r\namusement; prone to excursion-trains, art museums, periodical\r\nliterature, and exciting novels; prone even to scientific theorizing\r\nand cursory peeps through microscopes. Old Leisure was quite a\r\ndifferent personage. He only read one newspaper, innocent of leaders,\r\nand was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call\r\npost-time. He was a contemplative, rather stout gentleman, of excellent\r\ndigestion; of quiet perceptions, undiseased by hypothesis; happy in his\r\ninability to know the causes of things, preferring the things\r\nthemselves. He lived chiefly in the country, among pleasant seats and\r\nhomesteads, and was fond of sauntering by the fruit-tree wall and\r\nscenting the apricots when they were warmed by the morning sunshine, or\r\nof sheltering himself under the orchard boughs at noon, when the summer\r\npears were falling. He knew nothing of weekday services, and thought\r\nnone the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to sleep from the\r\ntext to the blessing; liking the afternoon service best, because the\r\nprayers were the shortest, and not ashamed to say so; for he had an\r\neasy, jolly conscience, broad-backed like himself, and able to carry a\r\ngreat deal of beer or port-wine, not being made squeamish by doubts and\r\nqualms and lofty aspirations. Life was not a task to him, but a\r\nsinecure. He fingered the guineas in his pocket, and ate his dinners,\r\nand slept the sleep of the irresponsible, for had he not kept up his\r\ncharacter by going to church on the Sunday afternoons?\r\n\r\nFine old Leisure! Do not be severe upon him, and judge him by our\r\nmodern standard. He never went to Exeter Hall, or heard a popular\r\npreacher, or read _Tracts for the Times_ or _Sartor Resartus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII\r\nThe Harvest Supper\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Adam was going homeward, on Wednesday evening, in the six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nsunlight, he saw in the distance the last load of barley winding its\r\nway towards the yard-gate of the Hall Farm, and heard the chant of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarvest Home!\xe2\x80\x9d rising and sinking like a wave. Fainter and fainter,\r\nand more musical through the growing distance, the falling dying sound\r\nstill reached him, as he neared the Willow Brook. The low westering sun\r\nshone right on the shoulders of the old Binton Hills, turning the\r\nunconscious sheep into bright spots of light; shone on the windows of\r\nthe cottage too, and made them a-flame with a glory beyond that of\r\namber or amethyst. It was enough to make Adam feel that he was in a\r\ngreat temple, and that the distant chant was a sacred song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9chow that sound goes to one\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nalmost like a funeral bell, for all it tells one o\xe2\x80\x99 the joyfullest time\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the year, and the time when men are mostly the thankfullest. I\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit hard to us to think anything\xe2\x80\x99s over and gone in our\r\nlives; and there\xe2\x80\x99s a parting at the root of all our joys. It\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nwhat I feel about Dinah. I should never ha\xe2\x80\x99 come to know that her love\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be the greatest o\xe2\x80\x99 blessings to me, if what I counted a blessing\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been wrenched and torn away from me, and left me with a greater\r\nneed, so as I could crave and hunger for a greater and a better\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe expected to see Dinah again this evening, and get leave to accompany\r\nher as far as Oakbourne; and then he would ask her to fix some time\r\nwhen he might go to Snowfield, and learn whether the last best hope\r\nthat had been born to him must be resigned like the rest. The work he\r\nhad to do at home, besides putting on his best clothes, made it seven\r\nbefore he was on his way again to the Hall Farm, and it was\r\nquestionable whether, with his longest and quickest strides, he should\r\nbe there in time even for the roast beef, which came after the plum\r\npudding, for Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s supper would be punctual.\r\n\r\nGreat was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans when\r\nAdam entered the house, but there was no hum of voices to this\r\naccompaniment: the eating of excellent roast beef, provided free of\r\nexpense, was too serious a business to those good farm-labourers to be\r\nperformed with a divided attention, even if they had had anything to\r\nsay to each other\xe2\x80\x94which they had not. And Mr. Poyser, at the head of\r\nthe table, was too busy with his carving to listen to Bartle Massey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nor Mr. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s ready talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Adam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, who was standing and looking on to see\r\nthat Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a place kept\r\nfor you between Mr. Massey and the boys. It\xe2\x80\x99s a poor tale you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome to see the pudding when it was whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam looked anxiously round for a fourth woman\xe2\x80\x99s figure, but Dinah was\r\nnot there. He was almost afraid of asking about her; besides, his\r\nattention was claimed by greetings, and there remained the hope that\r\nDinah was in the house, though perhaps disinclined to festivities on\r\nthe eve of her departure.\r\n\r\nIt was a goodly sight\xe2\x80\x94that table, with Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s round\r\ngood-humoured face and large person at the head of it helping his\r\nservants to the fragrant roast beef and pleased when the empty plates\r\ncame again. Martin, though usually blest with a good appetite, really\r\nforgot to finish his own beef to-night\xe2\x80\x94it was so pleasant to him to\r\nlook on in the intervals of carving and see how the others enjoyed\r\ntheir supper; for were they not men who, on all the days of the year\r\nexcept Christmas Day and Sundays, ate their cold dinner, in a makeshift\r\nmanner, under the hedgerows, and drank their beer out of wooden\r\nbottles\xe2\x80\x94with relish certainly, but with their mouths towards the\r\nzenith, after a fashion more endurable to ducks than to human bipeds.\r\nMartin Poyser had some faint conception of the flavour such men must\r\nfind in hot roast beef and fresh-drawn ale. He held his head on one\r\nside and screwed up his mouth, as he nudged Bartle Massey, and watched\r\nhalf-witted Tom Tholer, otherwise known as \xe2\x80\x9cTom Saft,\xe2\x80\x9d receiving his\r\nsecond plateful of beef. A grin of delight broke over Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face as the\r\nplate was set down before him, between his knife and fork, which he\r\nheld erect, as if they had been sacred tapers. But the delight was too\r\nstrong to continue smouldering in a grin\xe2\x80\x94it burst out the next instant\r\nin a long-drawn \xe2\x80\x9chaw, haw!\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a sudden collapse into utter\r\ngravity, as the knife and fork darted down on the prey. Martin Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge person shook with his silent unctuous laugh. He turned towards\r\nMrs. Poyser to see if she too had been observant of Tom, and the eyes\r\nof husband and wife met in a glance of good-natured amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Saft\xe2\x80\x9d was a great favourite on the farm, where he played the part\r\nof the old jester, and made up for his practical deficiencies by his\r\nsuccess in repartee. His hits, I imagine, were those of the flail,\r\nwhich falls quite at random, but nevertheless smashes an insect now and\r\nthen. They were much quoted at sheep-shearing and haymaking times, but\r\nI refrain from recording them here, lest Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wit should prove to be\r\nlike that of many other bygone jesters eminent in their day\xe2\x80\x94rather of a\r\ntemporary nature, not dealing with the deeper and more lasting\r\nrelations of things.\r\n\r\nTom excepted, Martin Poyser had some pride in his servants and\r\nlabourers, thinking with satisfaction that they were the best worth\r\ntheir pay of any set on the estate. There was Kester Bale, for example\r\n(Beale, probably, if the truth were known, but he was called Bale, and\r\nwas not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter), the old man with the\r\nclose leather cap and the network of wrinkles on his sun-browned face.\r\nWas there any man in Loamshire who knew better the \xe2\x80\x9cnatur\xe2\x80\x9d of all\r\nfarming work? He was one of those invaluable labourers who can not only\r\nturn their hand to everything, but excel in everything they turn their\r\nhand to. It is true Kester\xe2\x80\x99s knees were much bent outward by this time,\r\nand he walked with a perpetual curtsy, as if he were among the most\r\nreverent of men. And so he was; but I am obliged to admit that the\r\nobject of his reverence was his own skill, towards which he performed\r\nsome rather affecting acts of worship. He always thatched the ricks\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nif anything were his forte more than another, it was thatching\xe2\x80\x94and when\r\nthe last touch had been put to the last beehive rick, Kester, whose\r\nhome lay at some distance from the farm, would take a walk to the\r\nrick-yard in his best clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the\r\nlane, at a due distance, to contemplate his own thatching, walking\r\nabout to get each rick from the proper point of view. As he curtsied\r\nalong, with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden\r\nglobes at the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of\r\nthe best sort, you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan\r\nact of adoration. Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have\r\nstockings full of coin, concerning which his master cracked a joke with\r\nhim every pay-night: not a new unseasoned joke, but a good old one,\r\nthat had been tried many times before and had worn well. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 young\r\nmeaster\xe2\x80\x99s a merry mon,\xe2\x80\x9d Kester frequently remarked; for having begun\r\nhis career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin Poyser\r\nbut one, he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young\r\nmaster. I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester. You and I are\r\nindebted to the hard hands of such men\xe2\x80\x94hands that have long ago mingled\r\nwith the soil they tilled so faithfully, thriftily making the best they\r\ncould of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s fruits, and receiving the smallest share as their\r\nown wages.\r\n\r\nThen, at the end of the table, opposite his master, there was Alick,\r\nthe shepherd and head-man, with the ruddy face and broad shoulders, not\r\non the best terms with old Kester; indeed, their intercourse was\r\nconfined to an occasional snarl, for though they probably differed\r\nlittle concerning hedging and ditching and the treatment of ewes, there\r\nwas a profound difference of opinion between them as to their own\r\nrespective merits. When Tityrus and Meliboeus happen to be on the same\r\nfarm, they are not sentimentally polite to each other. Alick, indeed,\r\nwas not by any means a honeyed man. His speech had usually something of\r\na snarl in it, and his broad-shouldered aspect something of the\r\nbull-dog expression\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you meddle with me, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t meddle with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d But he was honest even to the splitting of an oat-grain rather\r\nthan he would take beyond his acknowledged share, and as \xe2\x80\x9cclose-fisted\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith his master\xe2\x80\x99s property as if it had been his own\xe2\x80\x94throwing very\r\nsmall handfuls of damaged barley to the chickens, because a large\r\nhandful affected his imagination painfully with a sense of profusion.\r\nGood-tempered Tim, the waggoner, who loved his horses, had his grudge\r\nagainst Alick in the matter of corn. They rarely spoke to each other,\r\nand never looked at each other, even over their dish of cold potatoes;\r\nbut then, as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all\r\nmankind, it would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more than\r\ntransient fits of unfriendliness. The bucolic character at Hayslope,\r\nyou perceive, was not of that entirely genial, merry, broad-grinning\r\nsort, apparently observed in most districts visited by artists. The\r\nmild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on a field-labourer\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nand there was seldom any gradation between bovine gravity and a laugh.\r\nNor was every labourer so honest as our friend Alick. At this very\r\ntable, among Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s men, there is that big Ben Tholoway, a very\r\npowerful thresher, but detected more than once in carrying away his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s corn in his pockets\xe2\x80\x94an action which, as Ben was not a\r\nphilosopher, could hardly be ascribed to absence of mind. However, his\r\nmaster had forgiven him, and continued to employ him, for the Tholoways\r\nhad lived on the Common time out of mind, and had always worked for the\r\nPoysers. And on the whole, I daresay, society was not much the worse\r\nbecause Ben had not six months of it at the treadmill, for his views of\r\ndepredation were narrow, and the House of Correction might have\r\nenlarged them. As it was, Ben ate his roast beef to-night with a serene\r\nsense of having stolen nothing more than a few peas and beans as seed\r\nfor his garden since the last harvest supper, and felt warranted in\r\nthinking that Alick\xe2\x80\x99s suspicious eye, for ever upon him, was an injury\r\nto his innocence.\r\n\r\nBut _now_ the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn, leaving\r\na fair large deal table for the bright drinking-cans, and the foaming\r\nbrown jugs, and the bright brass candlesticks, pleasant to behold.\r\n_Now_, the great ceremony of the evening was to begin\xe2\x80\x94the harvest-song,\r\nin which every man must join. He might be in tune, if he liked to be\r\nsingular, but he must not sit with closed lips. The movement was\r\nobliged to be in triple time; the rest was _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of this song\xe2\x80\x94whether it came in its actual state from\r\nthe brain of a single rhapsodist, or was gradually perfected by a\r\nschool or succession of rhapsodists, I am ignorant. There is a stamp of\r\nunity, of individual genius upon it, which inclines me to the former\r\nhypothesis, though I am not blind to the consideration that this unity\r\nmay rather have arisen from that consensus of many minds which was a\r\ncondition of primitive thought, foreign to our modern consciousness.\r\nSome will perhaps think that they detect in the first quatrain an\r\nindication of a lost line, which later rhapsodists, failing in\r\nimaginative vigour, have supplied by the feeble device of iteration.\r\nOthers, however, may rather maintain that this very iteration is an\r\noriginal felicity, to which none but the most prosaic minds can be\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony. (That is\r\nperhaps a painful fact, but then, you know, we cannot reform our\r\nforefathers.) During the first and second quatrain, sung decidedly\r\n_forte_, no can was filled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a health unto our master,\r\n    The founder of the feast;\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a health unto our master\r\n    And to our mistress!\r\n\r\nAnd may his doings prosper,\r\n    Whate\xe2\x80\x99er he takes in hand,\r\nFor we are all his servants,\r\n    And are at his command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now, immediately before the third quatrain or chorus, sung\r\n_fortissimo_, with emphatic raps of the table, which gave the effect of\r\ncymbals and drum together, Alick\xe2\x80\x99s can was filled, and he was bound to\r\nempty it before the chorus ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen drink, boys, drink!\r\n    And see ye do not spill,\r\nFor if ye do, ye shall drink two,\r\n    For \xe2\x80\x99tis our master\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady-handed\r\nmanliness, it was the turn of old Kester, at his right hand\xe2\x80\x94and so on,\r\ntill every man had drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the\r\nchorus. Tom Saft\xe2\x80\x94the rogue\xe2\x80\x94took care to spill a little by accident; but\r\nMrs. Poyser (too officiously, Tom thought) interfered to prevent the\r\nexaction of the penalty.\r\n\r\nTo any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of\r\nobvious why the \xe2\x80\x9cDrink, boys, drink!\xe2\x80\x9d should have such an immediate and\r\noften-repeated encore; but once entered, he would have seen that all\r\nfaces were at present sober, and most of them serious\xe2\x80\x94it was the\r\nregular and respectable thing for those excellent farm-labourers to do,\r\nas much as for elegant ladies and gentlemen to smirk and bow over their\r\nwine-glasses. Bartle Massey, whose ears were rather sensitive, had gone\r\nout to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the\r\nceremony, and had not finished his contemplation until a silence of\r\nfive minutes declared that \xe2\x80\x9cDrink, boys, drink!\xe2\x80\x9d was not likely to\r\nbegin again for the next twelvemonth. Much to the regret of the boys\r\nand Totty: on them the stillness fell rather flat, after that glorious\r\nthumping of the table, towards which Totty, seated on her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee, contributed with her small might and small fist.\r\n\r\nWhen Bartle re-entered, however, there appeared to be a general desire\r\nfor solo music after the choral. Nancy declared that Tim the waggoner\r\nknew a song and was \xe2\x80\x9callays singing like a lark i\xe2\x80\x99 the stable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhereupon Mr. Poyser said encouragingly, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Tim, lad, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Tim looked sheepish, tucked down his head, and said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsing, but this encouraging invitation of the master\xe2\x80\x99s was echoed all\r\nround the table. It was a conversational opportunity: everybody could\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Tim,\xe2\x80\x9d except Alick, who never relaxed into the frivolity of\r\nunnecessary speech. At last, Tim\xe2\x80\x99s next neighbour, Ben Tholoway, began\r\nto give emphasis to his speech by nudges, at which Tim, growing rather\r\nsavage, said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me alooan, will ye? Else I\xe2\x80\x99ll ma\xe2\x80\x99 ye sing a toon ye\r\nwonna like.\xe2\x80\x9d A good-tempered waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s patience has limits, and Tim\r\nwas not to be urged further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, David, ye\xe2\x80\x99re the lad to sing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, willing to show\r\nthat he was not discomfited by this check. \xe2\x80\x9cSing \xe2\x80\x98My loove\xe2\x80\x99s a roos\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99out a thorn.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted\r\nexpression, which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity\r\nrather than to any mental characteristic; for he was not indifferent to\r\nBen\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, but blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over\r\nhis mouth in a way that was regarded as a symptom of yielding. And for\r\nsome time the company appeared to be much in earnest about the desire\r\nto hear David\xe2\x80\x99s song. But in vain. The lyricism of the evening was in\r\nthe cellar at present, and was not to be drawn from that retreat just\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken a\r\npolitical turn. Mr. Craig was not above talking politics occasionally,\r\nthough he piqued himself rather on a wise insight than on specific\r\ninformation. He saw so far beyond the mere facts of a case that really\r\nit was superfluous to know them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no reader o\xe2\x80\x99 the paper myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed to-night, as he filled\r\nhis pipe, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I might read it fast enough if I liked, for there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMiss Lyddy has \xe2\x80\x99em and \xe2\x80\x99s done with \xe2\x80\x99em i\xe2\x80\x99 no time. But there\xe2\x80\x99s Mills,\r\nnow, sits i\xe2\x80\x99 the chimney-corner and reads the paper pretty nigh from\r\nmorning to night, and when he\xe2\x80\x99s got to th\xe2\x80\x99 end on\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\naddle-headed than he was at the beginning. He\xe2\x80\x99s full o\xe2\x80\x99 this peace now,\r\nas they talk on; he\xe2\x80\x99s been reading and reading, and thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s got to\r\nthe bottom on\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98Why, Lor\xe2\x80\x99 bless you, Mills,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98you see no more\r\ninto this thing nor you can see into the middle of a potato. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what it is: you think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fine thing for the country. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not again\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x94mark my words\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not again\xe2\x80\x99 it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion\r\nas there\xe2\x80\x99s them at the head o\xe2\x80\x99 this country as are worse enemies to us\r\nnor Bony and all the mounseers he\xe2\x80\x99s got at \xe2\x80\x99s back; for as for the\r\nmounseers, you may skewer half-a-dozen of \xe2\x80\x99em at once as if they war\r\nfrogs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Poyser, listening with an air of much\r\nintelligence and edification, \xe2\x80\x9cthey ne\xe2\x80\x99er ate a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 beef i\xe2\x80\x99 their\r\nlives. Mostly sallet, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd says I to Mills,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Craig, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Will _you_ try to make me\r\nbelieve as furriners like them can do us half th\xe2\x80\x99 harm them ministers\r\ndo with their bad government? If King George \xe2\x80\x99ud turn \xe2\x80\x99em all away and\r\ngovern by himself, he\xe2\x80\x99d see everything righted. He might take on Billy\r\nPitt again if he liked; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself what we want wi\xe2\x80\x99 anybody\r\nbesides King and Parliament. It\xe2\x80\x99s that nest o\xe2\x80\x99 ministers does the\r\nmischief, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Poyser, who was now seated near\r\nher husband, with Totty on her lap\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard work\r\nto tell which is Old Harry when everybody\xe2\x80\x99s got boots on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for this peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side in a\r\ndubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his pipe between\r\neach sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Th\xe2\x80\x99 war\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing for the country,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 how\xe2\x80\x99ll you keep up prices wi\xe2\x80\x99out it? An\xe2\x80\x99 them French are a wicked\r\nsort o\xe2\x80\x99 folks, by what I can make out. What can you do better nor fight\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re partly right there, Poyser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not again\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe peace\xe2\x80\x94to make a holiday for a bit. We can break it when we like,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ in no fear o\xe2\x80\x99 Bony, for all they talk so much o\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\ncliverness. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I says to Mills this morning. Lor\xe2\x80\x99 bless you,\r\nhe sees no more through Bony!... why, I put him up to more in three\r\nminutes than he gets from\xe2\x80\x99s paper all the year round. Says I, \xe2\x80\x98Am I a\r\ngardener as knows his business, or arn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Mills? Answer me that.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98To\r\nbe sure y\xe2\x80\x99 are, Craig,\xe2\x80\x99 says he\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad fellow, Mills isn\xe2\x80\x99t, for\r\na butler, but weak i\xe2\x80\x99 the head. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 Bony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncliverness; would it be any use my being a first-rate gardener if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot nought but a quagmire to work on?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 I says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s just what it is wi\xe2\x80\x99 Bony. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not deny but he may be a bit\r\ncliver\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s no Frenchman born, as I understand\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s he got at\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback but mounseers?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this triumphant\r\nspecimen of Socratic argument, and then added, thumping the table\r\nrather fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sure thing\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s them \xe2\x80\x99ull bear\r\nwitness to\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94as i\xe2\x80\x99 one regiment where there was one man a-missing, they\r\nput the regimentals on a big monkey, and they fit him as the shell fits\r\nthe walnut, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the monkey from the mounseers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Think o\xe2\x80\x99 that, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, impressed at once with the\r\npolitical bearings of the fact and with its striking interest as an\r\nanecdote in natural history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Craig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a little too strong. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve that. It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense about the French being such poor\r\nsticks. Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s seen \xe2\x80\x99em in their own country, and he says they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nplenty o\xe2\x80\x99 fine fellows among \xe2\x80\x99em. And as for knowledge, and\r\ncontrivances, and manufactures, there\xe2\x80\x99s a many things as we\xe2\x80\x99re a fine\r\nsight behind \xe2\x80\x99em in. It\xe2\x80\x99s poor foolishness to run down your enemies.\r\nWhy, Nelson and the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99ud have no merit i\xe2\x80\x99 beating \xe2\x80\x99em, if\r\nthey were such offal as folks pretend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr. Craig, puzzled by this opposition\r\nof authorities. Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was not to be disputed; but, on\r\nthe other hand, Craig was a knowing fellow, and his view was less\r\nstartling. Martin had never \xe2\x80\x9cheard tell\xe2\x80\x9d of the French being good for\r\nmuch. Mr. Craig had found no answer but such as was implied in taking a\r\nlong draught of ale and then looking down fixedly at the proportions of\r\nhis own leg, which he turned a little outward for that purpose, when\r\nBartle Massey returned from the fireplace, where he had been smoking\r\nhis first pipe in quiet, and broke the silence by saying, as he thrust\r\nhis forefinger into the canister, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Adam, how happened you not to\r\nbe at church on Sunday? Answer me that, you rascal. The anthem went\r\nlimping without you. Are you going to disgrace your schoolmaster in his\r\nold age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Massey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Poyser can tell you where I\r\nwas. I was in no bad company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone, Adam\xe2\x80\x94gone to Snowfield,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, reminded of\r\nDinah for the first time this evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 persuaded\r\nher better. Nought \xe2\x80\x99ud hold her, but she must go yesterday forenoon.\r\nThe missis has hardly got over it. I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 no sperrit for\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 harvest supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in,\r\nbut she had had \xe2\x80\x9cno heart\xe2\x80\x9d to mention the bad news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, with an air of disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there a woman\r\nconcerned? Then I give you up, Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a woman you\xe2\x80\x99n spoke well on, Bartle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nnow, you canna draw back; you said once as women wouldna ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a bad\r\ninvention if they\xe2\x80\x99d all been like Dinah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant her voice, man\xe2\x80\x94I meant her voice, that was all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear to hear her speak without wanting to put wool in my ears.\r\nAs for other things, I daresay she\xe2\x80\x99s like the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the women\xe2\x80\x94thinks\r\ntwo and two \xe2\x80\x99ll come to make five, if she cries and bothers enough\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser; \xe2\x80\x9cone \xe2\x80\x99ud think, an\xe2\x80\x99 hear some folks talk,\r\nas the men war \xe2\x80\x99cute enough to count the corns in a bag o\xe2\x80\x99 wheat wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nonly smelling at it. They can see through a barn-door, _they_ can.\r\nPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason they can see so little o\xe2\x80\x99 this side on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at Adam, as much\r\nas to say the schoolmaster was in for it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle sneeringly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe women are quick enough\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re quick\r\nenough. They know the rights of a story before they hear it, and can\r\ntell a man what his thoughts are before he knows \xe2\x80\x99em himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the men are mostly so slow, their\r\nthoughts overrun \xe2\x80\x99em, an\xe2\x80\x99 they can only catch \xe2\x80\x99em by the tail. I can\r\ncount a stocking-top while a man\xe2\x80\x99s getting\xe2\x80\x99s tongue ready an\xe2\x80\x99 when he\r\nouts wi\xe2\x80\x99 his speech at last, there\xe2\x80\x99s little broth to be made on\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour dead chicks take the longest hatchin\xe2\x80\x99. Howiver, I\xe2\x80\x99m not denyin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe women are foolish: God Almighty made \xe2\x80\x99em to match the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, as vinegar matches one\xe2\x80\x99s teeth. If a man\r\nsays a word, his wife \xe2\x80\x99ll match it with a contradiction; if he\xe2\x80\x99s a mind\r\nfor hot meat, his wife \xe2\x80\x99ll match it with cold bacon; if he laughs,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll match him with whimpering. She\xe2\x80\x99s such a match as the horse-fly\r\nis to th\xe2\x80\x99 horse: she\xe2\x80\x99s got the right venom to sting him with\xe2\x80\x94the right\r\nvenom to sting him with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Poyser, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what the men like\xe2\x80\x94a poor soft, as \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nsimper at \xe2\x80\x99em like the picture o\xe2\x80\x99 the sun, whether they did right or\r\nwrong, an\xe2\x80\x99 say thank you for a kick, an\xe2\x80\x99 pretend she didna know which\r\nend she stood uppermost, till her husband told her. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a man\r\nwants in a wife, mostly; he wants to make sure o\xe2\x80\x99 one fool as \xe2\x80\x99ull tell\r\nhim he\xe2\x80\x99s wise. But there\xe2\x80\x99s some men can do wi\xe2\x80\x99out that\xe2\x80\x94they think so\r\nmuch o\xe2\x80\x99 themselves a\xe2\x80\x99ready. An\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is there\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nbachelors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Craig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser jocosely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mun get married pretty\r\nquick, else you\xe2\x80\x99ll be set down for an old bachelor; an\xe2\x80\x99 you see what\r\nthe women \xe2\x80\x99ull think on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craig, willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and setting a\r\nhigh value on his own compliments, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ like a cleverish woman\xe2\x80\x94a woman\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 sperrit\xe2\x80\x94a managing woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re out there, Craig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, dryly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re out there. You\r\njudge o\xe2\x80\x99 your garden-stuff on a better plan than that. You pick the\r\nthings for what they can excel in\xe2\x80\x94for what they can excel in. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nvalue your peas for their roots, or your carrots for their flowers.\r\nNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you should choose women. Their cleverness \xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ncome to much\xe2\x80\x94never come to much\xe2\x80\x94but they make excellent simpletons,\r\nripe and strong-flavoured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Poyser, throwing himself back and\r\nlooking merrily at his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Poyser, with dangerous fire kindling in her eye.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I say as some folks\xe2\x80\x99 tongues are like the clocks as run on\r\nstrikin\xe2\x80\x99, not to tell you the time o\xe2\x80\x99 the day, but because there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsummat wrong i\xe2\x80\x99 their own inside...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further\r\nclimax, if every one\xe2\x80\x99s attention had not at this moment been called to\r\nthe other end of the table, where the lyricism, which had at first only\r\nmanifested itself by David\xe2\x80\x99s _sotto voce_ performance of \xe2\x80\x9cMy love\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrose without a thorn,\xe2\x80\x9d had gradually assumed a rather deafening and\r\ncomplex character. Tim, thinking slightly of David\xe2\x80\x99s vocalization, was\r\nimpelled to supersede that feeble buzz by a spirited commencement of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Merry Mowers,\xe2\x80\x9d but David was not to be put down so easily, and\r\nshowed himself capable of a copious crescendo, which was rendering it\r\ndoubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the mowers, when\r\nold Kester, with an entirely unmoved and immovable aspect, suddenly set\r\nup a quavering treble\xe2\x80\x94as if he had been an alarum, and the time was\r\ncome for him to go off.\r\n\r\nThe company at Alick\xe2\x80\x99s end of the table took this form of vocal\r\nentertainment very much as a matter of course, being free from musical\r\nprejudices; but Bartle Massey laid down his pipe and put his fingers in\r\nhis ears; and Adam, who had been longing to go ever since he had heard\r\nDinah was not in the house, rose and said he must bid good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you before my ears\r\nare split.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round by the Common and see you home, if you like, Mr.\r\nMassey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle; \xe2\x80\x9cthen we can have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 talk together. I\r\nnever get hold of you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity but you\xe2\x80\x99d sit it out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Poyser. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nall go soon, for th\xe2\x80\x99 missis niver lets \xe2\x80\x99em stay past ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Adam was resolute, so the good-nights were said, and the two\r\nfriends turned out on their starlight walk together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s that poor fool, Vixen, whimpering for me at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBartle. \xe2\x80\x9cI can never bring her here with me for fear she should be\r\nstruck with Mrs. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and the poor bitch might go limping for\r\never after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never any need to drive Gyp back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nalways turns back of his own head when he finds out I\xe2\x80\x99m coming here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle. \xe2\x80\x9cA terrible woman!\xe2\x80\x94made of needles, made of\r\nneedles. But I stick to Martin\xe2\x80\x94I shall always stick to Martin. And he\r\nlikes the needles, God help him! He\xe2\x80\x99s a cushion made on purpose for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s a downright good-natur\xe2\x80\x99d woman, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand as true as the daylight. She\xe2\x80\x99s a bit cross wi\xe2\x80\x99 the dogs when they\r\noffer to come in th\xe2\x80\x99 house, but if they depended on her, she\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\ncare and have \xe2\x80\x99em well fed. If her tongue\xe2\x80\x99s keen, her heart\xe2\x80\x99s tender:\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in times o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble. She\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 those women as are\r\nbetter than their word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartle, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say th\xe2\x80\x99 apple isn\xe2\x80\x99t sound at the\r\ncore; but it sets my teeth on edge\xe2\x80\x94it sets my teeth on edge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV\r\nThe Meeting on the Hill\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam understood Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s haste to go away, and drew hope rather than\r\ndiscouragement from it. She was fearful lest the strength of her\r\nfeeling towards him should hinder her from waiting and listening\r\nfaithfully for the ultimate guiding voice from within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to write to me, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet\r\neven that might disturb her a bit, perhaps. She wants to be quite quiet\r\nin her old way for a while. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to be impatient and\r\ninterrupting her with my wishes. She\xe2\x80\x99s told me what her mind is, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not a woman to say one thing and mean another. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\npatiently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was Adam\xe2\x80\x99s wise resolution, and it throve excellently for the\r\nfirst two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance\r\nof Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s confession that Sunday afternoon. There is a wonderful\r\namount of sustenance in the first few words of love. But towards the\r\nmiddle of October the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly, and\r\nshowed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion. The weeks were unusually long:\r\nDinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind.\r\nLet a woman say what she will after she has once told a man that she\r\nloves him, he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first\r\ndraught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second. He\r\ntreads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her,\r\nand makes light of all difficulties. But that sort of glow dies out:\r\nmemory gets sadly diluted with time, and is not strong enough to revive\r\nus. Adam was no longer so confident as he had been. He began to fear\r\nthat perhaps Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s old life would have too strong a grasp upon her\r\nfor any new feeling to triumph. If she had not felt this, she would\r\nsurely have written to him to give him some comfort; but it appeared\r\nthat she held it right to discourage him. As Adam\xe2\x80\x99s confidence waned,\r\nhis patience waned with it, and he thought he must write himself. He\r\nmust ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was\r\nneedful. He sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next\r\nmorning he burnt it, afraid of its effect. It would be worse to have a\r\ndiscouraging answer by letter than from her own lips, for her presence\r\nreconciled him to her will.\r\n\r\nYou perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah, and\r\nwhen that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to\r\nstill it though he may have to put his future in pawn.\r\n\r\nBut what harm could he do by going to Snowfield? Dinah could not be\r\ndispleased with him for it. She had not forbidden him to go. She must\r\nsurely expect that he would go before long. By the second Sunday in\r\nOctober this view of the case had become so clear to Adam that he was\r\nalready on his way to Snowfield, on horseback this time, for his hours\r\nwere precious now, and he had borrowed Jonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s good nag for\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nWhat keen memories went along the road with him! He had often been to\r\nOakbourne and back since that first journey to Snowfield, but beyond\r\nOakbourne the greystone walls, the broken country, the meagre trees,\r\nseemed to be telling him afresh the story of that painful past which he\r\nknew so well by heart. But no story is the same to us after a lapse of\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94or rather, we who read it are no longer the same interpreters\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nAdam this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey\r\ncountry, thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThat is a base and selfish, even a blasphemous, spirit which rejoices\r\nand is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed\r\nanother, because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to\r\nourselves. Adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human\r\nsorrow which had been brought so close to him; he could never thank God\r\nfor another\xe2\x80\x99s misery. And if I were capable of that narrow-sighted joy\r\nin Adam\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, I should still know he was not the man to feel it for\r\nhimself. He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvil\xe2\x80\x99s evil, and sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t alter it\xe2\x80\x99s natur by\r\nwrapping it up in other words. Other folks were not created for my\r\nsake, that I should think all square when things turn out well for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad\r\nexperience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain.\r\nSurely it is not possible to feel otherwise, any more than it would be\r\npossible for a man with cataract to regret the painful process by which\r\nhis dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for\r\nclear outline and effulgent day. The growth of higher feeling within us\r\nis like the growth of faculty, bringing with it a sense of added\r\nstrength. We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a\r\npainter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner, or a\r\nphilosopher to his less complete formula.\r\n\r\nSomething like this sense of enlarged being was in Adam\xe2\x80\x99s mind this\r\nSunday morning, as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past. His\r\nfeeling towards Dinah, the hope of passing his life with her, had been\r\nthe distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield\r\neighteen months ago had been leading him. Tender and deep as his love\r\nfor Hetty had been\xe2\x80\x94so deep that the roots of it would never be torn\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him, for it was\r\nthe outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his\r\nacquaintance with deep sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like as if it was a new strength\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cto love her and know as she loves me. I\r\nshall look t\xe2\x80\x99 her to help me to see things right. For she\xe2\x80\x99s better than\r\nI am\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s less o\xe2\x80\x99 self in her, and pride. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling as\r\ngives you a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 liberty, as if you could walk more fearless, when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve more trust in another than y\xe2\x80\x99 have in yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been\r\nthinking I knew better than them as belonged to me, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a poor\r\nsort o\xe2\x80\x99 life, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t look to them nearest to you t\xe2\x80\x99 help you\r\nwith a bit better thought than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got inside you a\xe2\x80\x99ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was more than two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon when Adam came in sight\r\nof the grey town on the hill-side and looked searchingly towards the\r\ngreen valley below, for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near\r\nthe ugly red mill. The scene looked less harsh in the soft October\r\nsunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring, and the one\r\ngrand charm it possessed in common with all wide-stretching woodless\r\nregions\xe2\x80\x94that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching\r\nsky\xe2\x80\x94had a milder, more soothing influence than usual, on this almost\r\ncloudless day. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s doubts and fears melted under this influence as\r\nthe delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear\r\nblue above him. He seemed to see Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s gentle face assuring him, with\r\nits looks alone, of all he longed to know.\r\n\r\nHe did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour, but he got down\r\nfrom his horse and tied it at the little gate, that he might ask where\r\nshe was gone to-day. He had set his mind on following her and bringing\r\nher home. She was gone to Sloman\xe2\x80\x99s End, a hamlet about three miles off,\r\nover the hill, the old woman told him\xe2\x80\x94had set off directly after\r\nmorning chapel, to preach in a cottage there, as her habit was. Anybody\r\nat the town would tell him the way to Sloman\xe2\x80\x99s End. So Adam got on his\r\nhorse again and rode to the town, putting up at the old inn and taking\r\na hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord, from\r\nwhose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as\r\nsoon as possible and set out towards Sloman\xe2\x80\x99s End. With all his haste\r\nit was nearly four o\xe2\x80\x99clock before he could set off, and he thought that\r\nas Dinah had gone so early, she would perhaps already be near\r\nreturning. The little, grey, desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by\r\nsheltering trees, lay in sight long before he reached it, and as he\r\ncame near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the last hymn before they come away,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk\r\nback a bit and turn again to meet her, farther off the village.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwalked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again, and seated\r\nhimself on a loose stone, against the low wall, to watch till he should\r\nsee the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill.\r\nHe chose this spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away\r\nfrom all eyes\xe2\x80\x94no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near\xe2\x80\x94no\r\npresence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.\r\n\r\nShe was much longer coming than he expected. He waited an hour at least\r\nwatching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows\r\nlengthened and the light grew softer. At last he saw the little black\r\nfigure coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching\r\nthe foot of the hill. Slowly, Adam thought, but Dinah was really\r\nwalking at her usual pace, with a light quiet step. Now she was\r\nbeginning to wind along the path up the hill, but Adam would not move\r\nyet; he would not meet her too soon; he had set his heart on meeting\r\nher in this assured loneliness. And now he began to fear lest he should\r\nstartle her too much. \xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s not one to be\r\noverstartled; she\xe2\x80\x99s always so calm and quiet, as if she was prepared\r\nfor anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was she thinking of as she wound up the hill? Perhaps she had\r\nfound complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of\r\nhis love. On the verge of a decision we all tremble: hope pauses with\r\nfluttering wings.\r\n\r\nBut now at last she was very near, and Adam rose from the stone wall.\r\nIt happened that just as he walked forward, Dinah had paused and turned\r\nround to look back at the village\xe2\x80\x94who does not pause and look back in\r\nmounting a hill? Adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover,\r\nhe felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw\r\nhim. He came within three paces of her and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cDinah!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstarted without looking round, as if she connected the sound with no\r\nplace. \xe2\x80\x9cDinah!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said again. He knew quite well what was in her\r\nmind. She was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual\r\nmonitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBut this second time she looked round. What a look of yearning love it\r\nwas that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed man! She did\r\nnot start again at the sight of him; she said nothing, but moved\r\ntowards him so that his arm could clasp her round.\r\n\r\nAnd they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell. Adam was\r\ncontent, and said nothing. It was Dinah who spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the Divine Will. My soul is so knit to yours\r\nthat it is but a divided life I live without you. And this moment, now\r\nyou are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same\r\nlove. I have a fulness of strength to bear and do our heavenly Father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWill that I had lost before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam paused and looked into her sincere eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll never part any more, Dinah, till death parts us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they kissed each other with a deep joy.\r\n\r\nWhat greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they\r\nare joined for life\xe2\x80\x94to strengthen each other in all labour, to rest on\r\neach other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be\r\none with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the\r\nlast parting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV\r\nMarriage Bells\r\n\r\n\r\nIn little more than a month after that meeting on the hill\xe2\x80\x94on a rimy\r\nmorning in departing November\xe2\x80\x94Adam and Dinah were married.\r\n\r\nIt was an event much thought of in the village. All Mr. Burge\xe2\x80\x99s men had\r\na holiday, and all Mr. Poyser\xe2\x80\x99s, and most of those who had a holiday\r\nappeared in their best clothes at the wedding. I think there was hardly\r\nan inhabitant of Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still\r\nresident in the parish on this November morning who was not either in\r\nchurch to see Adam and Dinah married, or near the church door to greet\r\nthem as they came forth. Mrs. Irwine and her daughters were waiting at\r\nthe churchyard gates in their carriage (for they had a carriage now) to\r\nshake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish them well; and in\r\nthe absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath, Mrs. Best, Mr. Mills,\r\nand Mr. Craig had felt it incumbent on them to represent \xe2\x80\x9cthe family\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the Chase on the occasion. The churchyard walk was quite lined with\r\nfamiliar faces, many of them faces that had first looked at Dinah when\r\nshe preached on the Green. And no wonder they showed this eager\r\ninterest on her marriage morning, for nothing like Dinah and the\r\nhistory which had brought her and Adam Bede together had been known at\r\nHayslope within the memory of man.\r\n\r\nBessy Cranage, in her neatest cap and frock, was crying, though she did\r\nnot exactly know why; for, as her cousin Wiry Ben, who stood near her,\r\njudiciously suggested, Dinah was not going away, and if Bessy was in\r\nlow spirits, the best thing for her to do was to follow Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s example\r\nand marry an honest fellow who was ready to have her. Next to Bessy,\r\njust within the church door, there were the Poyser children, peeping\r\nround the corner of the pews to get a sight of the mysterious ceremony;\r\nTotty\xe2\x80\x99s face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at the idea of seeing\r\ncousin Dinah come back looking rather old, for in Totty\xe2\x80\x99s experience no\r\nmarried people were young.\r\n\r\nI envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended\r\nand Adam led Dinah out of church. She was not in black this morning,\r\nfor her Aunt Poyser would by no means allow such a risk of incurring\r\nbad luck, and had herself made a present of the wedding dress, made all\r\nof grey, though in the usual Quaker form, for on this point Dinah could\r\nnot give way. So the lily face looked out with sweet gravity from under\r\na grey Quaker bonnet, neither smiling nor blushing, but with lips\r\ntrembling a little under the weight of solemn feelings. Adam, as he\r\npressed her arm to his side, walked with his old erectness and his head\r\nthrown rather backward as if to face all the world better. But it was\r\nnot because he was particularly proud this morning, as is the wont of\r\nbridegrooms, for his happiness was of a kind that had little reference\r\nto men\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of it. There was a tinge of sadness in his deep joy;\r\nDinah knew it, and did not feel aggrieved.\r\n\r\nThere were three other couples, following the bride and bridegroom:\r\nfirst, Martin Poyser, looking as cheery as a bright fire on this rimy\r\nmorning, led quiet Mary Burge, the bridesmaid; then came Seth serenely\r\nhappy, with Mrs. Poyser on his arm; and last of all Bartle Massey, with\r\nLisbeth\xe2\x80\x94Lisbeth in a new gown and bonnet, too busy with her pride in\r\nher son and her delight in possessing the one daughter she had desired\r\nto devise a single pretext for complaint.\r\n\r\nBartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adam\xe2\x80\x99s earnest\r\nrequest, under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of\r\na sensible man in particular. Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser had a joke\r\nagainst him after the wedding dinner, to the effect that in the vestry\r\nhe had given the bride one more kiss than was necessary.\r\n\r\nBehind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this good\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s work of joining Adam and Dinah. For he had seen Adam in the\r\nworst moments of his sorrow; and what better harvest from that painful\r\nseed-time could there be than this? The love that had brought hope and\r\ncomfort in the hour of despair, the love that had found its way to the\r\ndark prison cell and to poor Hetty\xe2\x80\x99s darker soul\xe2\x80\x94this strong gentle\r\nlove was to be Adam\xe2\x80\x99s companion and helper till death.\r\n\r\nThere was much shaking of hands mingled with \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nother good wishes to the four couples, at the churchyard gate, Mr.\r\nPoyser answering for the rest with unwonted vivacity of tongue, for he\r\nhad all the appropriate wedding-day jokes at his command. And the\r\nwomen, he observed, could never do anything but put finger in eye at a\r\nwedding. Even Mrs. Poyser could not trust herself to speak as the\r\nneighbours shook hands with her, and Lisbeth began to cry in the face\r\nof the very first person who told her she was getting young again.\r\n\r\nMr. Joshua Rann, having a slight touch of rheumatism, did not join in\r\nthe ringing of the bells this morning, and, looking on with some\r\ncontempt at these informal greetings which required no official\r\nco-operation from the clerk, began to hum in his musical bass, \xe2\x80\x9cOh what\r\na joyful thing it is,\xe2\x80\x9d by way of preluding a little to the effect he\r\nintended to produce in the wedding psalm next Sunday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of good news to cheer Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Irwine to his\r\nmother, as they drove off. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall write to him the first thing when\r\nwe get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is near the end of June, in 1807. The workshops have been shut up\r\nhalf an hour or more in Adam Bede\xe2\x80\x99s timber-yard, which used to be\r\nJonathan Burge\xe2\x80\x99s, and the mellow evening light is falling on the\r\npleasant house with the buff walls and the soft grey thatch, very much\r\nas it did when we saw Adam bringing in the keys on that June evening\r\nnine years ago.\r\n\r\nThere is a figure we know well, just come out of the house, and shading\r\nher eyes with her hands as she looks for something in the distance, for\r\nthe rays that fall on her white borderless cap and her pale auburn hair\r\nare very dazzling. But now she turns away from the sunlight and looks\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\nWe can see the sweet pale face quite well now: it is scarcely at all\r\naltered\xe2\x80\x94only a little fuller, to correspond to her more matronly\r\nfigure, which still seems light and active enough in the plain black\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him, Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d Dinah said, as she looked into the house. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go\r\nand meet him. Come, Lisbeth, come with Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last call was answered immediately by a small fair creature with\r\npale auburn hair and grey eyes, little more than four years old, who\r\nran out silently and put her hand into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Uncle Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Seth answered from within, and presently\r\nappeared stooping under the doorway, being taller than usual by the\r\nblack head of a sturdy two-year-old nephew, who had caused some delay\r\nby demanding to be carried on uncle\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter take him on thy arm, Seth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, looking fondly at the\r\nstout black-eyed fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s troublesome to thee so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay: Addy likes a ride on my shoulder. I can carry him so for a\r\nbit.\xe2\x80\x9d A kindness which young Addy acknowledged by drumming his heels\r\nwith promising force against Uncle Seth\xe2\x80\x99s chest. But to walk by Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, and be tyrannized over by Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s and Adam\xe2\x80\x99s children, was Uncle\r\nSeth\xe2\x80\x99s earthly happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere didst see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Seth, as they walked on into the adjoining\r\nfield. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t catch sight of him anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween the hedges by the roadside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw his hat and\r\nhis shoulder. There he is again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust thee for catching sight of him if he\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Seth, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x99t like poor mother used to be. She was always\r\non the look out for Adam, and could see him sooner than other folks,\r\nfor all her eyes got dim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been longer than he expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, taking Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s watch\r\nfrom a small side pocket and looking at it; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nigh upon seven now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, they\xe2\x80\x99d have a deal to say to one another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nmeeting \xe2\x80\x99ud touch \xe2\x80\x99em both pretty closish. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting on towards\r\neight years since they parted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam was greatly moved this morning at the thought\r\nof the change he should see in the poor young man, from the sickness he\r\nhas undergone, as well as the years which have changed us all. And the\r\ndeath of the poor wanderer, when she was coming back to us, has been\r\nsorrow upon sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Addy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, lowering the young one to his arm now and\r\npointing, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s Father coming\xe2\x80\x94at the far stile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinah hastened her steps, and little Lisbeth ran on at her utmost speed\r\ntill she clasped her father\xe2\x80\x99s leg. Adam patted her head and lifted her\r\nup to kiss her, but Dinah could see the marks of agitation on his face\r\nas she approached him, and he put her arm within his in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, youngster, must I take you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to smile, when Addy\r\nstretched out his arms\xe2\x80\x94ready, with the usual baseness of infancy, to\r\ngive up his Uncle Seth at once, now there was some rarer patronage at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cut me a good deal, Dinah,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said at last, when they were\r\nwalking on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst find him greatly altered?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s altered and yet not altered. I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 known him\r\nanywhere. But his colour\xe2\x80\x99s changed, and he looks sadly. However, the\r\ndoctors say he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be set right in his own country air. He\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nsound in th\xe2\x80\x99 inside; it\xe2\x80\x99s only the fever shattered him so. But he\r\nspeaks just the same, and smiles at me just as he did when he was a\r\nlad. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how he\xe2\x80\x99s always had just the same sort o\xe2\x80\x99 look when\r\nhe smiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him smile, poor young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee _wilt_ see him smile, to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam. \xe2\x80\x9cHe asked after\r\nthee the first thing when he began to come round, and we could talk to\r\none another. \xe2\x80\x98I hope she isn\xe2\x80\x99t altered,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I remember her face\r\nso well.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him \xe2\x80\x98no,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Adam continued, looking fondly at the eyes\r\nthat were turned towards his, \xe2\x80\x9conly a bit plumper, as thee\xe2\x80\x99dst a right\r\nto be after seven year. \xe2\x80\x98I may come and see her to-morrow, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said; \xe2\x80\x98I long to tell her how I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of her all these years.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst tell him I\xe2\x80\x99d always used the watch?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye; and we talked a deal about thee, for he says he never saw a woman\r\na bit like thee. \xe2\x80\x98I shall turn Methodist some day,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98when she\r\npreaches out of doors, and go to hear her.\xe2\x80\x99 And I said, \xe2\x80\x98Nay, sir, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do that, for Conference has forbid the women preaching, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiven it up, all but talking to the people a bit in their houses.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth, who could not repress a comment on this point, \xe2\x80\x9cand a\r\nsore pity it was o\xe2\x80\x99 Conference; and if Dinah had seen as I did, we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 left the Wesleyans and joined a body that \xe2\x80\x99ud put no bonds on\r\nChristian liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lad, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was right and thee wast wrong. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno rules so wise but what it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity for somebody or other. Most o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe women do more harm nor good with their preaching\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve not got\r\nDinah\xe2\x80\x99s gift nor her sperrit\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s seen that, and she thought it\r\nright to set th\xe2\x80\x99 example o\xe2\x80\x99 submitting, for she\xe2\x80\x99s not held from other\r\nsorts o\xe2\x80\x99 teaching. And I agree with her, and approve o\xe2\x80\x99 what she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeth was silent. This was a standing subject of difference rarely\r\nalluded to, and Dinah, wishing to quit it at once, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDidst\r\nremember, Adam, to speak to Colonel Donnithorne the words my uncle and\r\naunt entrusted to thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the Hall Farm with Mr. Irwine the day after\r\nto-morrow. Mr. Irwine came in while we were talking about it, and he\r\nwould have it as the Colonel must see nobody but thee to-morrow. He\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99s in the right of it\xe2\x80\x94as it\xe2\x80\x99ll be bad for him t\xe2\x80\x99 have his\r\nfeelings stirred with seeing many people one after another. \xe2\x80\x98We must\r\nget you strong and hearty,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing to be done\r\nArthur, and then you shall have your own way. But I shall keep you\r\nunder your old tutor\xe2\x80\x99s thumb till then.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Irwine\xe2\x80\x99s fine and joyful\r\nat having him home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdam was silent a little while, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very cutting\r\nwhen we first saw one another. He\xe2\x80\x99d never heard about poor Hetty till\r\nMr. Irwine met him in London, for the letters missed him on his\r\njourney. The first thing he said to me, when we\xe2\x80\x99d got hold o\xe2\x80\x99 one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s hands was, \xe2\x80\x98I could never do anything for her, Adam\xe2\x80\x94she lived\r\nlong enough for all the suffering\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99d thought so of the time when I\r\nmight do something for her. But you told me the truth when you said to\r\nme once, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of wrong that can never be made up for.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. and Mrs. Poyser coming in at the yard gate,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dinah. \xe2\x80\x9cRun, Lisbeth, run to meet Aunt Poyser. Come\r\nin, Adam, and rest; it has been a hard day for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ADAM BEDE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
