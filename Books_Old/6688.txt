On this mighty tide the black\r\nships\xe2\x80\x94laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of\r\noil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal\xe2\x80\x94are borne along to\r\nthe town of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the\r\nbroad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the\r\nriver-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the\r\ntransient glance of this February sun. Far away on each hand stretch\r\nthe rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the\r\nseed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of\r\nthe tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the\r\nhedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the\r\ndistant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their\r\nred-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash. Just by\r\nthe red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current\r\ninto the Floss. How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing\r\nwavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along\r\nthe bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one\r\nwho is deaf and loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I\r\nremember the stone bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a minute or two here on the\r\nbridge and look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is far\r\non in the afternoon. Even in this leafless time of departing February\r\nit is pleasant to look at,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the chill, damp season adds a charm\r\nto the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and\r\nchestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast. The stream is\r\nbrimful now, and lies high in this little withy plantation, and half\r\ndrowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house. As I look\r\nat the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder\r\nsoftening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from\r\nunder the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy the\r\nwhite ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among\r\nthe withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier\r\nworld above.\r\n\r\nThe rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy\r\ndeafness, which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene. They\r\nare like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world\r\nbeyond. And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming\r\nhome with sacks of grain. That honest wagoner is thinking of his\r\ndinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will\r\nnot touch it till he has fed his horses,\xe2\x80\x94the strong, submissive,\r\nmeek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from\r\nbetween their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that\r\nawful manner as if they needed that hint! See how they stretch their\r\nshoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy\r\nbecause they are so near home. Look at their grand shaggy feet that\r\nseem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks,\r\nbowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their struggling\r\nhaunches! I should like well to hear them neigh over their\r\nhardly-earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed\r\nfrom the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond. Now\r\nthey are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace, and\r\nthe arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nNow I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting\r\nwheel sending out its diamond jets of water. That little girl is\r\nwatching it too; she has been standing on just the same spot at the\r\nedge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge. And that queer\r\nwhite cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in\r\nineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he is jealous because\r\nhis playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement. It is\r\ntime the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright\r\nfire to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of\r\nthe sky. It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms on the\r\ncold stone of this bridge....\r\n\r\nAh, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the\r\narms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in\r\nfront of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years\r\nago. Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs\r\nTulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the\r\nleft-hand parlour, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat I want is to give Tom\r\na good eddication; an eddication as\xe2\x80\x99ll be a bread to him. That was what\r\nI was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at\r\nLady-day. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.\r\nThe two years at th\xe2\x80\x99 academy \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 done well enough, if I\xe2\x80\x99d meant to\r\nmake a miller and farmer of him, for he\xe2\x80\x99s had a fine sight more\r\nschoolin\xe2\x80\x99 nor _I_ ever got. All the learnin\xe2\x80\x99 _my_ father ever paid for\r\nwas a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 birch at one end and the alphabet at th\xe2\x80\x99 other. But I\r\nshould like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the\r\ntricks o\xe2\x80\x99 these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish. It \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe a help to me wi\xe2\x80\x99 these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a downright lawyer o\xe2\x80\x99 the lad,\xe2\x80\x94I should be sorry for him\r\nto be a raskill,\xe2\x80\x94but a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 engineer, or a surveyor, or an\r\nauctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o\xe2\x80\x99 them smartish businesses\r\nas are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain and a high\r\nstool. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty nigh all one, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not far off being even\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 the law, _I_ believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i\xe2\x80\x99 the face as\r\nhard as one cat looks another. _He\xe2\x80\x99s_ none frightened at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a\r\nfan-shaped cap (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped\r\ncaps were worn, they must be so near coming in again. At that time,\r\nwhen Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nconsidered sweet things).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Tulliver, you know best: _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ no objections. But hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nbetter kill a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 fowl, and have th\xe2\x80\x99 aunts and uncles to dinner\r\nnext week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have\r\ngot to say about it? There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 fowl _wants_ killing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may kill every fowl i\xe2\x80\x99 the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall\r\nask neither aunt nor uncle what I\xe2\x80\x99m to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 my own lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nTulliver, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? But it\xe2\x80\x99s your way to speak\r\ndisrespectful o\xe2\x80\x99 my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme, though I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m as innocent as the babe unborn. For nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\never heard me say as it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lucky for my children to have aunts and\r\nuncles as can live independent. Howiver, if Tom\xe2\x80\x99s to go to a new\r\nschool, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else\r\nhe might as well have calico as linen, for they\xe2\x80\x99d be one as yallow as\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 other before they\xe2\x80\x99d been washed half-a-dozen times. And then, when\r\nthe box is goin\xe2\x80\x99 back\xe2\x80\x99ard and forrard, I could send the lad a cake, or\r\na pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless him!\r\nwhether they stint him at the meals or no. My children can eat as much\r\nvictuals as most, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t send him out o\xe2\x80\x99 reach o\xe2\x80\x99 the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s cart, if\r\nother things fit in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t put a spoke i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe wheel about the washin,\xe2\x80\x99 if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get a school near enough.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the fault I have to find wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, Bessy; if you see a stick i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe road, you\xe2\x80\x99re allays thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 you can\xe2\x80\x99t step over it. You\xe2\x80\x99d want me\r\nnot to hire a good wagoner, \xe2\x80\x99cause he\xe2\x80\x99d got a mole on his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, in mild surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen did I iver\r\nmake objections to a man because he\xe2\x80\x99d got a mole on his face? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m rether fond o\xe2\x80\x99 the moles; for my brother, as is dead an\xe2\x80\x99 gone, had\r\na mole on his brow. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember your iver offering to hire a\r\nwagoner with a mole, Mr Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a mole on\r\nhis face no more nor you have, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was all for having you hire _him_;\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 so you did hire him, an\xe2\x80\x99 if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t died o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 inflammation, as\r\nwe paid Dr Turnbull for attending him, he\xe2\x80\x99d very like ha\xe2\x80\x99 been drivin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe wagon now. He might have a mole somewhere out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight, but how was\r\nI to know that, Mr Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Bessy; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for\r\nsummat else; but niver mind\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling work, talking is. What I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthinking on, is how to find the right sort o\xe2\x80\x99 school to send Tom to,\r\nfor I might be ta\xe2\x80\x99en in again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 academy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nnothing to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 a \xe2\x80\x99cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it\r\nsha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be a \xe2\x80\x99cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their\r\ntime i\xe2\x80\x99 summat else besides blacking the family\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, and getting up\r\nthe potatoes. It\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to\r\npick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his\r\nbreeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there.\r\nApparently he was not disappointed, for he presently said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do: I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk it over wi\xe2\x80\x99 Riley; he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-morrow, t\xe2\x80\x99\r\narbitrate about the dam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Tulliver, I\xe2\x80\x99ve put the sheets out for the best bed, and\r\nKezia\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x99em hanging at the fire. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best sheets, but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as\r\nfor them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying \xe2\x80\x99em, only they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo to lay us out in. An\xe2\x80\x99 if you was to die to-morrow, Mr Tulliver,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re mangled beautiful, an\xe2\x80\x99 all ready, an\xe2\x80\x99 smell o\xe2\x80\x99 lavender as it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be a pleasure to lay \xe2\x80\x99em out; an\xe2\x80\x99 they lie at the left-hand corner\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody\r\nto look \xe2\x80\x99em out but myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of\r\nkeys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger\r\nup and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire.\r\nIf Mr Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he\r\nmight have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in\r\nanticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the\r\nproduction of the best Holland sheets. Happily he was not so; he was\r\nonly susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he\r\nhad the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his\r\nmention of Mr Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile\r\nexamination of his woollen stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d was his first remark after a short\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x9cRiley\xe2\x80\x99s as likely a man as any to know o\xe2\x80\x99 some school; he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad schooling himself, an\xe2\x80\x99 goes about to all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 places,\r\narbitratin\xe2\x80\x99 and vallyin\xe2\x80\x99 and that. And we shall have time to talk it\r\nover to-morrow night when the business is done. I want Tom to be such a\r\nsort o\xe2\x80\x99 man as Riley, you know,\xe2\x80\x94as can talk pretty nigh as well as if\r\nit was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o\xe2\x80\x99 words as don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean much, so as you can\xe2\x80\x99t lay hold of \xe2\x80\x99em i\xe2\x80\x99 law; and a good solid\r\nknowledge o\xe2\x80\x99 business too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as talking proper, and knowing\r\neverything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair\r\nup, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the lad being brought up to that. But them\r\nfine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts;\r\nthey wear a frill till it\xe2\x80\x99s all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I\r\nknow Riley does. And then, if Tom\xe2\x80\x99s to go and live at Mudport, like\r\nRiley, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an\xe2\x80\x99 sleep up three pair o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstairs,\xe2\x80\x94or four, for what I know,\xe2\x80\x94and be burnt to death before he can\r\nget down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport:\r\nI mean him to set up his office at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, close by us, an\xe2\x80\x99 live at\r\nhome. But,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Tulliver after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit afraid\r\non is, as Tom hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the right sort o\xe2\x80\x99 brains for a smart fellow. I\r\ndoubt he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, accepting the last proposition\r\nentirely on its own merits; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful for liking a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 salt\r\nin his broth. That was my brother\xe2\x80\x99s way, and my father\xe2\x80\x99s before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a bit a pity, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cas the lad should\r\ntake after the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side instead o\xe2\x80\x99 the little wench. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nworst on\xe2\x80\x99t wi\xe2\x80\x99 crossing o\xe2\x80\x99 breeds: you can never justly calkilate\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll come on\xe2\x80\x99t. The little un takes after my side, now: she\xe2\x80\x99s twice\r\nas \xe2\x80\x99cute as Tom. Too \xe2\x80\x99cute for a woman, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr\r\nTulliver, turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no mischief much while she\xe2\x80\x99s a little un; but an\r\nover-\xe2\x80\x99cute woman\xe2\x80\x99s no better nor a long-tailed sheep,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch none\r\nthe bigger price for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ a mischief while she\xe2\x80\x99s a little un, Mr Tulliver, for it\r\nruns to naughtiness. How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours\r\ntogether passes my cunning. An\xe2\x80\x99 now you put me i\xe2\x80\x99 mind,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs\r\nTulliver, rising and going to the window, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where she is\r\nnow, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so,\xe2\x80\x94wanderin\xe2\x80\x99 up an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndown by the water, like a wild thing: She\xe2\x80\x99ll tumble in some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nprocess which she repeated more than once before she returned to her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99cuteness, Mr Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed as she sat down,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the child\xe2\x80\x99s half an idiot i\xe2\x80\x99 some things; for if I send\r\nher upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what she\xe2\x80\x99s gone for, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nperhaps \xe2\x80\x99ull sit down on the floor i\xe2\x80\x99 the sunshine an\xe2\x80\x99 plait her hair\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur\xe2\x80\x99, all the while I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting\r\nfor her downstairs. That niver run i\xe2\x80\x99 my family, thank God! no more nor\r\na brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to fly i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe face o\xe2\x80\x99 Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one\r\ngell, an\xe2\x80\x99 her so comical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a straight, black-eyed wench\r\nas anybody need wish to see. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know i\xe2\x80\x99 what she\xe2\x80\x99s behind other\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99s children; and she can read almost as well as the parson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut her hair won\xe2\x80\x99t curl all I can do with it, and she\xe2\x80\x99s so franzy\r\nabout having it put i\xe2\x80\x99 paper, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve such work as never was to make\r\nher stand and have it pinched with th\xe2\x80\x99 irons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut it off\xe2\x80\x94cut it off short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, rashly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? She\xe2\x80\x99s too big a gell\xe2\x80\x94gone nine, and\r\ntall of her age\xe2\x80\x94to have her hair cut short; an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s her cousin\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s got a row o\xe2\x80\x99 curls round her head, an\xe2\x80\x99 not a hair out o\xe2\x80\x99 place.\r\nIt seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this\r\nsmall mistake of nature entered the room, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\ntelling you to keep away from the water? You\xe2\x80\x99ll tumble in and be\r\ndrownded some day, an\xe2\x80\x99 then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as mother\r\ntold you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s accusation. Mrs Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a\r\ncurled crop, \xe2\x80\x9clike other folks\xe2\x80\x99s children,\xe2\x80\x9d had had it cut too short in\r\nfront to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight an\r\nhour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly\r\ntossing her head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her gleaming\r\nblack eyes,\xe2\x80\x94an action which gave her very much the air of a small\r\nShetland pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of, to throw your\r\nbonnet down there? Take it upstairs, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good gell, an\xe2\x80\x99 let your\r\nhair be brushed, an\xe2\x80\x99 put your other pinafore on, an\xe2\x80\x99 change your shoes,\r\ndo, for shame; an\xe2\x80\x99 come an\xe2\x80\x99 go on with your patchwork, like a little\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_\r\nto do my patchwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt\r\nGlegg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s foolish work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with a toss of her mane,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctearing\r\nthings to pieces to sew \xe2\x80\x99em together again. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do\r\nanything for my aunt Glegg. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr Tulliver\r\nlaughs audibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at you, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh at her, Mr Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmother, with feeble fretfulness in her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou encourage her i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnaughtiness. An\xe2\x80\x99 her aunts will have it as it\xe2\x80\x99s me spoils her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,\xe2\x80\x94never cried,\r\nwhen she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and\r\nfrom the cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted;\r\nin short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk\r\nand mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn\r\nonly a little sour, they may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I\r\nhave often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the\r\nblond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity\r\nundisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little\r\ntoo old to do without clothing. I think they must have been given to\r\nfeeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more\r\nand more ineffectual.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nMr Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his\r\nbrandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr\r\nRiley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather highly\r\neducated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to\r\nshow a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country acquaintances of\r\nhospitable habits. Mr Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeople of the old school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation had come to a pause. Mr Tulliver, not without a\r\nparticular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool\r\nretort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem\r\nhad had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam\r\nhad been settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been\r\nany dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they\r\nshould be, and Old Harry hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made the lawyers. Mr Tulliver was, on\r\nthe whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points\r\nhe had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several\r\nquestionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and\r\nlawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily he had no one to tell him\r\nthat this was rampant Manich\xc3\xa6ism, else he might have seen his error.\r\nBut to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this\r\naffair of the water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all\r\nit seemed\xe2\x80\x94look at it one way\xe2\x80\x94as plain as water\xe2\x80\x99s water; but, big a\r\npuzzle as it was, it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the better of Riley. Mr Tulliver took\r\nhis brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who\r\nmight be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwas rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s business talents.\r\n\r\nBut the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could\r\nalways be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same\r\ncondition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr\r\nTulliver was in pressing want of Mr Riley\xe2\x80\x99s advice. This was his\r\nparticular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last\r\ndraught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner. He was not a man\r\nto make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling world, as he often\r\nsaid, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an\r\nawkward corner. Mr Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should he\r\nbe? Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his\r\nslippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous\r\nbrandy-and-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got i\xe2\x80\x99 my head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver at last, in\r\nrather a lower tone than usual, as he turned his head and looked\r\nsteadfastly at his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He was a man with\r\nheavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same\r\nunder all circumstances. This immovability of face, and the habit of\r\ntaking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer, made him trebly\r\noracular to Mr Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very particular thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s about my boy Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close\r\nby the fire, with a large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair\r\nback and looked up eagerly. There were few sounds that roused Maggie\r\nwhen she was dreaming over her book, but Tom\xe2\x80\x99s name served as well as\r\nthe shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with\r\ngleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all\r\nevents determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nTulliver; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 away from the \xe2\x80\x99cademy at Lady-day, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shall\r\nlet him run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him to a\r\ndownright good school, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll make a scholard of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no greater advantage you can give him\r\nthan a good education. Not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with polite significance,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nthat a man can\xe2\x80\x99t be an excellent miller and farmer, and a shrewd,\r\nsensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the\r\nschoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, winking, and turning his head on one\r\nside; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t _mean_ Tom to be a miller and\r\nfarmer. I see no fun i\xe2\x80\x99 that. Why, if I made him a miller an\xe2\x80\x99 farmer,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be expectin\xe2\x80\x99 to take to the mill an\xe2\x80\x99 the land, an\xe2\x80\x99 a-hinting at me\r\nas it was time for me to lay by an\xe2\x80\x99 think o\xe2\x80\x99 my latter end. Nay, nay,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough o\xe2\x80\x99 that wi\xe2\x80\x99 sons. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never pull my coat off before I\r\ngo to bed. I shall give Tom an eddication an\xe2\x80\x99 put him to a business, as\r\nhe may make a nest for himself, an\xe2\x80\x99 not want to push me out o\xe2\x80\x99 mine.\r\nPretty well if he gets it when I\xe2\x80\x99m dead an\xe2\x80\x99 gone. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be put off\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 spoon-meat afore I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was evidently a point on which Mr Tulliver felt strongly; and the\r\nimpetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech\r\nshowed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant\r\nmotion of the head from side to side, and an occasional \xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlike a subsiding growl.\r\n\r\nThese angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the\r\nquick. Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out\r\nof doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by his\r\nwickedness. This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her\r\nstool, forgetting all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang\r\nwithin the fender, and going up between her father\xe2\x80\x99s knees, said, in a\r\nhalf-crying, half-indignant voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, Tom wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be naughty to you ever; I know he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish,\r\nand Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about\r\nthe book. Mr Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the\r\nfather laughed, with a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and\r\npatted his little girl on the back, and then held her hands and kept\r\nher between his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! they mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say any harm o\xe2\x80\x99 Tom, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, looking\r\nat Maggie with a twinkling eye. Then, in a lower voice, turning to Mr\r\nRiley, as though Maggie couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, \xe2\x80\x9cShe understands what one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalking about so as never was. And you should hear her read,\xe2\x80\x94straight\r\noff, as if she knowed it all beforehand. And allays at her book! But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s bad\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Tulliver added sadly, checking this blamable\r\nexultation. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s no business wi\xe2\x80\x99 being so clever; it\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to\r\ntrouble, I doubt. But bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here the exultation was clearly\r\nrecovering the mastery,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll read the books and understand \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nbetter nor half the folks as are growed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement. She thought\r\nMr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he\r\nthought nothing of her before.\r\n\r\nMr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make\r\nnothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently\r\nlooked at her, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come and tell me something about this book; here are some\r\npictures,\xe2\x80\x94I want to know what they mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing\r\nback her mane, while she said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what that means. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful picture, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help looking at it. That old woman in the water\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwitch,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve put her in to find out whether she\xe2\x80\x99s a witch or no; and\r\nif she swims she\xe2\x80\x99s a witch, and if she\xe2\x80\x99s drowned\xe2\x80\x94and killed, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s innocent, and not a witch, but only a poor silly old woman.\r\nBut what good would it do her then, you know, when she was drowned?\r\nOnly, I suppose, she\xe2\x80\x99d go to heaven, and God would make it up to her.\r\nAnd this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo, laughing,\xe2\x80\x94oh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe ugly?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s the Devil _really_\xe2\x80\x9d (here\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s voice became louder and more emphatic), \xe2\x80\x9cand not a right\r\nblacksmith; for the Devil takes the shape of wicked men, and walks\r\nabout and sets people doing wicked things, and he\xe2\x80\x99s oftener in the\r\nshape of a bad man than any other, because, you know, if people saw he\r\nwas the Devil, and he roared at \xe2\x80\x99em, they\xe2\x80\x99d run away, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake \xe2\x80\x99em do what he pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s with petrifying\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what book is it the wench has got hold on?\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The History of the Devil,\xe2\x80\x99 by Daniel Defoe,\xe2\x80\x94not quite the right book\r\nfor a little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley. \xe2\x80\x9cHow came it among your books, Mr\r\nTulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her father said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 the books I bought at Partridge\xe2\x80\x99s sale. They was all\r\nbound alike,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a good binding, you see,\xe2\x80\x94and I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d be all\r\ngood books. There\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Holy Living and Dying\xe2\x80\x99 among \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nI read in it often of a Sunday\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity\r\nwith that great writer, because his name was Jeremy); \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlot more of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94sermons mostly, I think,\xe2\x80\x94but they\xe2\x80\x99ve all got the same\r\ncovers, and I thought they were all o\xe2\x80\x99 one sample, as you may say. But\r\nit seems one mustn\xe2\x80\x99t judge by th\xe2\x80\x99 outside. This is a puzzlin\xe2\x80\x99 world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he patted\r\nMaggie on the head, \xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to put by the \xe2\x80\x98History of the Devil,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand read some prettier book. Have you no prettier books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to vindicate\r\nthe variety of her reading. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the reading in this book isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures out\r\nof my own head, you know. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\x86sop\xe2\x80\x99s Fables,\xe2\x80\x99 and a book\r\nabout Kangaroos and things, and the \xe2\x80\x98Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a beautiful book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t read a better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal about the Devil in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\ntriumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the picture of him in his true shape,\r\nas he fought with Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair,\r\nand reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan,\r\nwhich opened at once, without the least trouble of search, at the\r\npicture she wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, running back to Mr Riley, \xe2\x80\x9cand Tom coloured him\r\nfor me with his paints when he was at home last holidays,\xe2\x80\x94the body all\r\nblack, you know, and the eyes red, like fire, because he\xe2\x80\x99s all fire\r\ninside, and it shines out at his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather\r\nuncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a\r\nbeing powerful enough to create lawyers; \xe2\x80\x9cshut up the book, and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhear no more o\xe2\x80\x99 such talk. It is as I thought\xe2\x80\x94the child \xe2\x80\x99ull learn more\r\nmischief nor good wi\xe2\x80\x99 the books. Go, go and see after your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not\r\nbeing inclined to see after her mother, she compromised the matter by\r\ngoing into a dark corner behind her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and nursing her\r\ndoll, toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it\r\nthat the waxen cheeks had a wasted, unhealthy appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear the like on\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, as Maggie retired.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity but what she\xe2\x80\x99d been the lad,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a match for\r\nthe lawyers, _she_ would. It\xe2\x80\x99s the wonderful\xe2\x80\x99st thing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here he lowered\r\nhis voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas I picked the mother because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99er \xe2\x80\x99cute\xe2\x80\x94bein\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\ngood-looking woman too, an\xe2\x80\x99 come of a rare family for managing; but I\r\npicked her from her sisters o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose, \xe2\x80\x99cause she was a bit weak like;\r\nfor I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t agoin\xe2\x80\x99 to be told the rights o\xe2\x80\x99 things by my own fireside.\r\nBut you see when a man\xe2\x80\x99s got brains himself, there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing where\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll run to; an\xe2\x80\x99 a pleasant sort o\xe2\x80\x99 soft woman may go on breeding\r\nyou stupid lads and \xe2\x80\x99cute wenches, till it\xe2\x80\x99s like as if the world was\r\nturned topsy-turvy. It\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon puzzlin\xe2\x80\x99 thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Riley\xe2\x80\x99s gravity gave way, and he shook a little under the\r\napplication of his pinch of snuff before he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your lad\xe2\x80\x99s not stupid, is he? I saw him, when I was here last,\r\nbusy making fishing-tackle; he seemed quite up to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t not to say stupid,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s got a notion o\xe2\x80\x99 things out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoor, an\xe2\x80\x99 a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 common sense, as he\xe2\x80\x99d lay hold o\xe2\x80\x99 things by the\r\nright handle. But he\xe2\x80\x99s slow with his tongue, you see, and he reads but\r\npoorly, and can\xe2\x80\x99t abide the books, and spells all wrong, they tell me,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 as shy as can be wi\xe2\x80\x99 strangers, an\xe2\x80\x99 you never hear him say \xe2\x80\x99cute\r\nthings like the little wench. Now, what I want is to send him to a\r\nschool where they\xe2\x80\x99ll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen,\r\nand make a smart chap of him. I want my son to be even wi\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\nfellows as have got the start o\xe2\x80\x99 me with having better schooling. Not\r\nbut what, if the world had been left as God made it, I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen\r\nmy way, and held my own wi\xe2\x80\x99 the best of \xe2\x80\x99em; but things have got so\r\ntwisted round and wrapped up i\xe2\x80\x99 unreasonable words, as aren\xe2\x80\x99t a bit\r\nlike \xe2\x80\x99em, as I\xe2\x80\x99m clean at fault, often an\xe2\x80\x99 often. Everything winds\r\nabout so\xe2\x80\x94the more straightforrad you are, the more you\xe2\x80\x99re puzzled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in\r\na melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a\r\nperfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite in the right of it, Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Riley. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter\r\nspend an extra hundred or two on your son\xe2\x80\x99s education, than leave it\r\nhim in your will. I know I should have tried to do so by a son of mine,\r\nif I\xe2\x80\x99d had one, though, God knows, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t your ready money to play\r\nwith, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say, now, you know of a school as \xe2\x80\x99ud be just the thing for\r\nTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy\r\nwith Mr Riley\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency of ready cash.\r\n\r\nMr Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr Tulliver in suspense by a\r\nsilence that seemed deliberative, before he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of a very fine chance for any one that\xe2\x80\x99s got the necessary\r\nmoney and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have, Tulliver. The fact is, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrecommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school, if he\r\ncould afford to do better. But if any one wanted his boy to get\r\nsuperior instruction and training, where he would be the companion of\r\nhis master, and that master a first rate fellow, I know his man. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the chance to everybody, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\neverybody would succeed in getting it, if he were to try; but I mention\r\nit to you, Tulliver, between ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fixed inquiring glance with which Mr Tulliver had been watching his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s oracular face became quite eager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, now, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adjusting himself in his chair with the\r\ncomplacency of a person who is thought worthy of important\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an Oxford man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, sententiously, shutting his mouth\r\nclose, and looking at Mr Tulliver to observe the effect of this\r\nstimulating information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! a parson?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, rather doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and an M.A. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him:\r\nwhy, it was the bishop who got him his present curacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another\r\nconcerning these unfamiliar phenomena. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what can he want wi\xe2\x80\x99 Tom,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fact is, he\xe2\x80\x99s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his\r\nstudies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his\r\nparochial duties. He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to\r\nfill up his time profitably. The boys would be quite of the family,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfinest thing in the world for them; under Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s eye continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think they\xe2\x80\x99d give the poor lad twice o\xe2\x80\x99 pudding?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, who was now in her place again. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s such a boy for pudding\r\nas never was; an\xe2\x80\x99 a growing boy like that,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntheir stintin\xe2\x80\x99 him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what money \xe2\x80\x99ud he want?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, whose instinct told him\r\nthat the services of this admirable M.A. would bear a high price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his\r\nyoungest pupils, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I\r\nspeak of. I know, on good authority, that one of the chief people at\r\nOxford said, Stelling might get the highest honours if he chose. But he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care about university honours; he\xe2\x80\x99s a quiet man\xe2\x80\x94not noisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a deal better\xe2\x80\x94a deal better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a hundred and\r\nfifty\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon price. I never thought o\xe2\x80\x99 paying so much as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x94a good education is cheap\r\nat the money. But Stelling is moderate in his terms; he\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\ngrasping man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt he\xe2\x80\x99d take your boy at a hundred, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get many other clergymen to do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to him\r\nabout it, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut belike he\xe2\x80\x99s a bachelor,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Tulliver, in the interval;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve no opinion o\xe2\x80\x99 housekeepers. There was my brother, as is dead\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 gone, had a housekeeper once, an\xe2\x80\x99 she took half the feathers out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe best bed, an\xe2\x80\x99 packed \xe2\x80\x99em up an\xe2\x80\x99 sent \xe2\x80\x99em away. An\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s unknown the\r\nlinen she made away with\xe2\x80\x94Stott her name was. It \xe2\x80\x99ud break my heart to\r\nsend Tom where there\xe2\x80\x99s a housekeeper, an\xe2\x80\x99 I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think of it,\r\nMr Tulliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nRiley, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man\r\nneed wish for a wife. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a kinder little soul in the world; I\r\nknow her family well. She has very much your complexion,\xe2\x80\x94light curly\r\nhair. She comes of a good Mudport family, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not every offer that\r\nwould have been acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s not an\r\neveryday man; rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to\r\nbe connected with. But I _think_ he would have no objection to take\r\nyour son; I _think_ he would not, on my representation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he could have _against_ the lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver,\r\nwith a slight touch of motherly indignation; \xe2\x80\x9ca nice fresh-skinned lad\r\nas anybody need wish to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, turning his\r\nhead on one side and looking at Mr Riley, after a long perusal of the\r\ncarpet. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a parson be almost too high-learnt to bring up a lad\r\nto be a man o\xe2\x80\x99 business? My notion o\xe2\x80\x99 the parsons was as they\xe2\x80\x99d got a\r\nsort o\xe2\x80\x99 learning as lay mostly out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight. And that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what I want\r\nfor Tom. I want him to know figures, and write like print, and see into\r\nthings quick, and know what folks mean, and how to wrap things up in\r\nwords as aren\xe2\x80\x99t actionable. It\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon fine thing, that is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nconcluded Mr Tulliver, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you can let a man know\r\nwhat you think of him without paying for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re quite under a mistake\r\nabout the clergy; all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy. The\r\nschoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men\r\ngenerally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that Jacobs is, at the \xe2\x80\x99cademy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x94men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now, a\r\nclergyman is a gentleman by profession and education; and besides that,\r\nhe has the knowledge that will ground a boy, and prepare him for\r\nentering on any career with credit. There may be some clergymen who are\r\nmere bookmen; but you may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x94a man that\xe2\x80\x99s wide awake, let me tell you. Drop him a hint, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s enough. You talk of figures, now; you have only to say to\r\nStelling, \xe2\x80\x98I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician,\xe2\x80\x99 and you may\r\nleave the rest to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Riley paused a moment, while Mr Tulliver, somewhat reassured as to\r\nclerical tutorship, was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr Stelling\r\nthe statement, \xe2\x80\x9cI want my son to know \xe2\x80\x99rethmetic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Riley continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you get a\r\nthoroughly educated man, like Stelling, he\xe2\x80\x99s at no loss to take up any\r\nbranch of instruction. When a workman knows the use of his tools, he\r\ncan make a door as well as a window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, almost convinced now that the\r\nclergy must be the best of schoolmasters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for everybody. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s father-in-law, or\r\ndrop him a line when I get back to Mudport, to say that you wish to\r\nplace your boy with his son-in-law, and I dare say Stelling will write\r\nto you, and send you his terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I hope, Mr\r\nTulliver, you won\xe2\x80\x99t let Tom begin at his new school before Midsummer.\r\nHe began at the \xe2\x80\x99cademy at the Lady-day quarter, and you see what\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x99s come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Bessy, never brew wi\xe2\x80\x99 bad malt upo\xe2\x80\x99 Michaelmas day, else\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a poor tap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, winking and smiling at Mr\r\nRiley, with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife\r\nconspicuously his inferior in intellect. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s true there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nhurry; you\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it there, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nRiley, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Stelling may have propositions from other parties,\r\nand I know he would not take more than two or three boarders, if so\r\nmany. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling\r\nat once: there\xe2\x80\x99s no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer, but\r\nI would be on the safe side, and make sure that nobody forestalls you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, there\xe2\x80\x99s summat in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow again, listening with parted lips, while she held her doll\r\ntopsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood of the\r\nchair,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfather, is it a long way off where Tom is to go? Sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\never go to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, my wench,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mr Riley; he\r\nknows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie came round promptly in front of Mr Riley, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow far is\r\nit, please, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a long, long way off,\xe2\x80\x9d that gentleman answered, being of opinion\r\nthat children, when they are not naughty, should always be spoken to\r\njocosely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must borrow the seven-leagued boots to get to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, tossing her head haughtily, and turning\r\naway, with the tears springing in her eyes. She began to dislike Mr\r\nRiley; it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nher mother. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down on your little stool, and hold your\r\ntongue, do. But,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Tulliver, who had her own alarm awakened,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis it so far off as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wash him and mend him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout fifteen miles; that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Riley. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can drive there\r\nand back in a day quite comfortably. Or\xe2\x80\x94Stelling is a hospitable,\r\npleasant man\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to have you stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s too far off for the linen, I doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver,\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and\r\nrelieved Mr Riley from the labour of suggesting some solution or\r\ncompromise,\xe2\x80\x94a labour which he would otherwise doubtless have\r\nundertaken; for, as you perceive, he was a man of very obliging\r\nmanners. And he had really given himself the trouble of recommending Mr\r\nStelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive expectation of a\r\nsolid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding the\r\nsubtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a too\r\nsagacious observer. For there is nothing more widely misleading than\r\nsagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity, persuaded\r\nthat men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a\r\nconsciously proposed end in view, is certain to waste its energies on\r\nimaginary game.\r\n\r\nPlotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass a\r\nselfish end, are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist:\r\nthey demand too intense a mental action for many of our\r\nfellow-parishioners to be guilty of them. It is easy enough to spoil\r\nthe lives of our neighbours without taking so much trouble; we can do\r\nit by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission, by trivial falsities for\r\nwhich we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralised by small\r\nextravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised\r\ninsinuations. We live from hand to mouth, most of us, with a small\r\nfamily of immediate desires; we do little else than snatch a morsel to\r\nsatisfy the hungry brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s crop.\r\n\r\nMr Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest,\r\nyet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of\r\nfar-sighted designs. He had no private understanding with the Rev.\r\nWalter Stelling; on the contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and\r\nhis acquirements,\xe2\x80\x94not quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a\r\nrecommendation of him as he had given to his friend Tulliver. But he\r\nbelieved Mr Stelling to be an excellent classic, for Gadsby had said\r\nso, and Gadsby\xe2\x80\x99s first cousin was an Oxford tutor; which was better\r\nground for the belief even than his own immediate observation would\r\nhave been, for though Mr Riley had received a tincture of the classics\r\nat the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of understanding\r\nLatin generally, his comprehension of any particular Latin was not\r\nready. Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile\r\ncontact with the _De Senectute_ and the fourth book of the _\xc3\x86neid_, but\r\nit had ceased to be distinctly recognisable as classical, and was only\r\nperceived in the higher finish and force of his auctioneering style.\r\nThen, Stelling was an Oxford man, and the Oxford men were always\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nno, it was the Cambridge men who were always good mathematicians. But a\r\nman who had had a university education could teach anything he liked;\r\nespecially a man like Stelling, who had made a speech at a Mudport\r\ndinner on a political occasion, and had acquitted himself so well that\r\nit was generally remarked, this son-in-law of Timpson\xe2\x80\x99s was a sharp\r\nfellow. It was to be expected of a Mudport man, from the parish of St\r\nUrsula, that he would not omit to do a good turn to a son-in-law of\r\nTimpson\xe2\x80\x99s, for Timpson was one of the most useful and influential men\r\nin the parish, and had a good deal of business, which he knew how to\r\nput into the right hands. Mr Riley liked such men, quite apart from any\r\nmoney which might be diverted, through their good judgment, from less\r\nworthy pockets into his own; and it would be a satisfaction to him to\r\nsay to Timpson on his return home, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve secured a good pupil for your\r\nson-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d Timpson had a large family of daughters; Mr Riley felt for\r\nhim; besides, Louisa Timpson\xe2\x80\x99s face, with its light curls, had been a\r\nfamiliar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly\r\nfifteen years; it was natural her husband should be a commendable\r\ntutor. Moreover, Mr Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any\r\nground for recommending in preference; why, then, should he not\r\nrecommend Stelling? His friend Tulliver had asked him for an opinion;\r\nit is always chilling, in friendly intercourse, to say you have no\r\nopinion to give. And if you deliver an opinion at all, it is mere\r\nstupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well-founded\r\nknowledge. You make it your own in uttering it, and naturally get fond\r\nof it. Thus Mr Riley, knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with, and\r\nwishing him well, so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him,\r\nhad no sooner recommended him than he began to think with admiration of\r\na man recommended on such high authority, and would soon have gathered\r\nso warm an interest on the subject, that if Mr Tulliver had in the end\r\ndeclined to send Tom to Stelling, Mr Riley would have thought his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfriend of the old school\xe2\x80\x9d a thoroughly pig-headed fellow.\r\n\r\nIf you blame Mr Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such\r\nslight grounds, I must say you are rather hard upon him. Why should an\r\nauctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago, who had as good as forgotten\r\nhis free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity\r\nwhich is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions,\r\neven in our present advanced stage of morality?\r\n\r\nBesides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely\r\nabstain from doing a good-natured action, and one cannot be\r\ngood-natured all round. Nature herself occasionally quarters an\r\ninconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill\r\nwill. What then? We admire her care for the parasite. If Mr Riley had\r\nshrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid\r\nevidence, he would not have helped Mr Stelling to a paying pupil, and\r\nthat would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider,\r\ntoo, that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nstanding well with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he was asked for\r\nit, of impressing his friend Tulliver with additional respect, of\r\nsaying something, and saying it emphatically, with other inappreciably\r\nminute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the\r\nbrandy-and-water to make up Mr Riley\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness on this\r\noccasion\xe2\x80\x94would have been a mere blank.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nTom Is Expected\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go\r\nwith her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the\r\nacademy; but the morning was too wet, Mrs Tulliver said, for a little\r\ngirl to go out in her best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very\r\nstrongly, and it was a direct consequence of this difference of opinion\r\nthat when her mother was in the act of brushing out the reluctant black\r\ncrop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her hands and dipped her head in\r\na basin of water standing near, in the vindictive determination that\r\nthere should be no more chance of curls that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless\r\nwith the brushes on her lap, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is to become of you if you\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nnaughty? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come\r\nnext week, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll never love you any more. Oh dear, oh dear! look\r\nat your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks \xe2\x80\x99ull think it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\njudgment on me as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a child,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done summat\r\nwicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of\r\nhearing, making her way toward the great attic that ran under the old\r\nhigh-pitched roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran,\r\nlike a Skye terrier escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here\r\nshe fretted out all her ill humours, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten\r\nfloors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with\r\ncobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her\r\nmisfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once\r\nstared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was\r\nnow entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three\r\nnails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s nine\r\nyears of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been\r\nsuggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old\r\nBible. The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than\r\nusual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But\r\nimmediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails\r\nin she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when\r\nshe knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make believe to\r\npoultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg would be\r\npitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated,\r\nso as to beg her niece\xe2\x80\x99s pardon. Since then she had driven no more\r\nnails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating\r\nthe wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made\r\ntwo square pillars supporting the roof. That was what she did this\r\nmorning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a passion\r\nthat expelled every other form of consciousness,\xe2\x80\x94even the memory of the\r\ngrievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were getting quieter,\r\nand the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of sunshine, falling\r\nthrough the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves, made her throw\r\naway the Fetish and run to the window. The sun was really breaking out;\r\nthe sound of the mill seemed cheerful again; the granary doors were\r\nopen; and there was Yap, the queer white-and-brown terrier, with one\r\near turned back, trotting about and sniffing vaguely, as if he were in\r\nsearch of a companion. It was irresistible. Maggie tossed her hair back\r\nand ran downstairs, seized her bonnet without putting it on, peeped,\r\nand then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother,\r\nand was quickly out in the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and\r\nsinging as she whirled, \xe2\x80\x9cYap, Yap, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s coming home!\xe2\x80\x9d while Yap danced\r\nand barked round her, as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted\r\nhe was the dog for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, hegh, Miss! you\xe2\x80\x99ll make yourself giddy, an\xe2\x80\x99 tumble down i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ndirt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, the head miller, a tall, broad-shouldered man of\r\nforty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness,\r\nlike an auricula.\r\n\r\nMaggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came\r\nout with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark\r\neyes flash out with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting motion of\r\nthe great stones, giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the presence of\r\nan uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring, pouring; the fine\r\nwhite powder softening all surfaces, and making the very spidernets\r\nlook like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of the meal,\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nhelped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from\r\nher outside everyday life. The spiders were especially a subject of\r\nspeculation with her. She wondered if they had any relatives outside\r\nthe mill, for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their\r\nfamily intercourse,\xe2\x80\x94a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take his fly\r\nwell dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin\xe2\x80\x99s table where\r\nthe fly was _au naturel_, and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked\r\nat each other\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. But the part of the mill she liked best was\r\nthe topmost story,\xe2\x80\x94the corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of\r\ngrain, which she could sit on and slide down continually. She was in\r\nthe habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with Luke, to whom\r\nshe was very communicative, wishing him to think well of her\r\nunderstanding, as her father did.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the\r\npresent occasion for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near\r\nwhich he was busying himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was\r\nrequisite in mill-society,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Miss, an\xe2\x80\x99 not much o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, with great frankness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no reader, I aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I\xe2\x80\x99ve not got any _very_\r\npretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Pug\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nTour of Europe,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that would tell you all about the different sorts of\r\npeople in the world, and if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the reading, the\r\npictures would help you; they show the looks and ways of the people,\r\nand what they do. There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you\r\nknow, and one sitting on a barrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99n no opinion o\xe2\x80\x99 Dutchmen. There ben\xe2\x80\x99t much good i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknowin\xe2\x80\x99 about _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re our fellow-creatures, Luke; we ought to know about our\r\nfellow-creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much o\xe2\x80\x99 fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss; all I know\xe2\x80\x94my old master,\r\nas war a knowin\xe2\x80\x99 man, used to say, says he, \xe2\x80\x98If e\xe2\x80\x99er I sow my wheat\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99out brinin\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Dutchman,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; an\xe2\x80\x99 that war as much as to\r\nsay as a Dutchman war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I aren\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nbother mysen about Dutchmen. There\xe2\x80\x99s fools enoo, an\xe2\x80\x99 rogues enoo,\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99out lookin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 books for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke\xe2\x80\x99s unexpectedly decided\r\nviews about Dutchmen, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you would like \xe2\x80\x98Animated Nature\xe2\x80\x99 better;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos, and the\r\ncivet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail,\xe2\x80\x94I forget\r\nits name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead of\r\nhorses and cows, you know. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to know about them,\r\nLuke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99n got to keep count o\xe2\x80\x99 the flour an\xe2\x80\x99 corn; I can\xe2\x80\x99t do wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknowin\xe2\x80\x99 so many things besides my work. That\xe2\x80\x99s what brings folks to the\r\ngallows,\xe2\x80\x94knowin\xe2\x80\x99 everything but what they\xe2\x80\x99n got to get their bread by.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly lies, I think, what\xe2\x80\x99s printed i\xe2\x80\x99 the books: them\r\nprinted sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i\xe2\x80\x99 the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re like my brother Tom, Luke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, wishing to turn\r\nthe conversation agreeably; \xe2\x80\x9cTom\xe2\x80\x99s not fond of reading. I love Tom so\r\ndearly, Luke,\xe2\x80\x94better than anybody else in the world. When he grows up I\r\nshall keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell him\r\neverything he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I think Tom\xe2\x80\x99s clever, for all he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like books; he makes beautiful whipcord and rabbit-pens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine an\xe2\x80\x99 vexed, as the rabbits are all\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Maggie, jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, Luke! What! the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe that Tom\r\nspent all his money to buy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs dead as moles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, fetching his comparison from the\r\nunmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, Luke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears\r\nrolled down her cheek; \xe2\x80\x9cTom told me to take care of \xe2\x80\x99em, and I forgot.\r\nWhat _shall_ I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an\xe2\x80\x99 it was\r\nnobody\xe2\x80\x99s business to see to \xe2\x80\x99em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to feed\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no countin\xe2\x80\x99 on Harry; _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ a offal creatur as iver\r\ncome about the primises, he is. He remembers nothing but his own\r\ninside\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I wish it \xe2\x80\x99ud gripe him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day;\r\nbut how could I, when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come into my head, you know? Oh, he\r\nwill be so angry with me, I know he will, and so sorry about his\r\nrabbits, and so am I sorry. Oh, what _shall_ I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you fret, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, soothingly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re nash things,\r\nthem lop-eared rabbits; they\xe2\x80\x99d happen ha\xe2\x80\x99 died, if they\xe2\x80\x99d been fed.\r\nThings out o\xe2\x80\x99 natur niver thrive: God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x99em. He\r\nmade the rabbits\xe2\x80\x99 ears to lie back, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but contrairiness\r\nto make \xe2\x80\x99em hing down like a mastiff dog\xe2\x80\x99s. Master Tom \xe2\x80\x99ull know better\r\nnor buy such things another time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret, Miss. Will you come\r\nalong home wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, and see my wife? I\xe2\x80\x99m a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s grief, and\r\nher tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke\xe2\x80\x99s side to his\r\npleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and with\r\nthe added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the Mill\r\nfields. Mrs Moggs, Luke\xe2\x80\x99s wife, was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance.\r\nShe exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed\r\nvarious works of art. Maggie actually forgot that she had any special\r\ncause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair to look at a\r\nremarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the\r\ncostume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have been\r\nexpected from his defective moral character, he had not, like that\r\naccomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a\r\nwig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind\r\ncaused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak\r\nyoung man, particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned\r\nagainst a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned\r\nand his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some foreign breed,\r\nseemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad his father took him back again, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Luke?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cFor he was very sorry, you know, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do wrong again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d be no great shakes, I doubt, let\xe2\x80\x99s feyther\r\ndo what he would for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the\r\nsubsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nTom Comes Home\r\n\r\nTom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and there was another\r\nfluttering heart besides Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s when it was late enough for the sound\r\nof the gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs Tulliver had a strong\r\nfeeling, it was fondness for her boy. At last the sound came,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nquick light bowling of the gig-wheels,\xe2\x80\x94and in spite of the wind, which\r\nwas blowing the clouds about, and was not likely to respect Mrs\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s curls and cap-strings, she came outside the door, and even\r\nheld her hand on Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s offending head, forgetting all the griefs of\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, my sweet lad! But, Lord ha\xe2\x80\x99 mercy! he\xe2\x80\x99s got never a\r\ncollar on; it\xe2\x80\x99s been lost on the road, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, and spoilt the\r\nset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver stood with her arms open; Maggie jumped first on one leg\r\nand then on the other; while Tom descended from the gig, and said, with\r\nmasculine reticence as to the tender emotions, \xe2\x80\x9cHallo! Yap\xe2\x80\x94what! are\r\nyou there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie\r\nhung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray\r\neyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he\r\npromised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow\r\nmorning. He was one of those lads that grow everywhere in England, and\r\nat twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and roses, full lips,\r\nindeterminate nose and eyebrows,\xe2\x80\x94a physiognomy in which it seems\r\nimpossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood; as\r\ndifferent as possible from poor Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s phiz, which Nature seemed to\r\nhave moulded and coloured with the most decided intention. But that\r\nsame Nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the\r\nappearance of openness, so that simple people think they can see\r\nthrough her quite well, and all the while she is secretly preparing a\r\nrefutation of their confident prophecies. Under these average boyish\r\nphysiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross, she conceals\r\nsome of her most rigid, inflexible purposes, some of her most\r\nunmodifiable characters; and the dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious\r\ngirl may after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this\r\npink-and-white bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, confidentially, taking her into a corner, as soon\r\nas his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlour had\r\ntaken off the chill he had felt from the long drive, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in _my_ pockets,\xe2\x80\x9d nodding his head up and down as a means\r\nof rousing her sense of mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cHow stodgy they look, Tom! Is it marls (marbles) or\r\ncobnuts?\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank a little, because Tom always said it was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno good\xe2\x80\x9d playing with _her_ at those games, she played so badly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarls! no; I\xe2\x80\x99ve swopped all my marls with the little fellows, and\r\ncobnuts are no fun, you silly, only when the nuts are green. But see\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d He drew something half out of his right-hand pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see nothing but a bit\r\nof yellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94new\xe2\x80\x94guess, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ guess, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a spitfire, else I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, thrusting his\r\nhand back into his pocket and looking determined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, imploringly, laying hold of the arm that was\r\nheld stiffly in the pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not cross, Tom; it was only because I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear guessing. _Please_ be good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s arm slowly relaxed, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s a new\r\nfish-line\xe2\x80\x94two new uns,\xe2\x80\x94one for you, Maggie, all to yourself. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money;\r\nand Gibson and Spouncer fought with me because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhooks; see here\xe2\x80\x94I say, _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ we go and fish to-morrow down by the\r\nRound Pool? And you shall catch your own fish, Maggie and put the worms\r\non, and everything; won\xe2\x80\x99t it be fun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s answer was to throw her arms round Tom\xe2\x80\x99s neck and hug him, and\r\nhold her cheek against his without speaking, while he slowly unwound\r\nsome of the line, saying, after a pause,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t I a good brother, now, to buy you a line all to yourself? You\r\nknow, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t have bought it, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very, very good\xe2\x80\x94I _do_ love you, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had put the line back in his pocket, and was looking at the hooks\r\none by one, before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the fellows fought me, because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give in about the\r\ntoffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! I wish they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight at your school, Tom. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nhurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt me? no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large\r\npocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at\r\nmeditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave Spouncer a black eye, I know; that\xe2\x80\x99s what he got by wanting to\r\nleather _me;_ I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to go halves because anybody leathered\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how brave you are, Tom! I think you\xe2\x80\x99re like Samson. If there came\r\na lion roaring at me, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d fight him, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There\xe2\x80\x99s no lions,\r\nonly in the shows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but if we were in the lion countries\xe2\x80\x94I mean in Africa, where it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery hot; the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book\r\nwhere I read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should get a gun and shoot him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got a gun,\xe2\x80\x94we might have gone out, you know, not\r\nthinking, just as we go fishing; and then a great lion might run\r\ntowards us roaring, and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away from him. What should you\r\ndo, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBut the\r\nlion _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ coming. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like to fancy how it would be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, following him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think what you would do, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother, Maggie! you\xe2\x80\x99re such a silly. I shall go and see my\r\nrabbits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to flutter with fear. She dared not tell the sad\r\ntruth at once, but she walked after Tom in trembling silence as he went\r\nout, thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once\r\nhis sorrow and his anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom\xe2\x80\x99s anger of all things;\r\nit was quite a different anger from her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timidly, when they were out of doors, \xe2\x80\x9chow much money\r\ndid you give for your rabbits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo half-crowns and a sixpence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great deal more than that in my steel purse\r\nupstairs. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask mother to give it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want _your_ money, you silly thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a great deal more money than you, because I\xe2\x80\x99m a boy. I always have\r\nhalf-sovereigns and sovereigns for my Christmas boxes because I shall\r\nbe a man, and you only have five-shilling pieces, because you\xe2\x80\x99re only a\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, Tom\xe2\x80\x94if mother would let me give you two half-crowns and a\r\nsixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend, you know,\r\nand buy some more rabbits with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore rabbits? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, Tom, they\xe2\x80\x99re all dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward Maggie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forgot to feed \xe2\x80\x99em, then, and Harry forgot?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, his colour\r\nheightening for a moment, but soon subsiding. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pitch into Harry.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have him turned away. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t love you, Maggie. You sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nfishing with me to-morrow. I told you to go and see the rabbits every\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I forgot\xe2\x80\x94and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, indeed, Tom. I\xe2\x80\x99m so very\r\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, while the tears rushed fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a naughty girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I bought\r\nyou the fish-line. I don\xe2\x80\x99t love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, it\xe2\x80\x99s very cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgive you, if _you_\r\nforgot anything\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind what you did\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d forgive you and love\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re silly; but I never _do_ forget things, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please forgive me, Tom; my heart will break,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, shaking\r\nwith sobs, clinging to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and laying her wet cheek on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nTom shook her off, and stopped again, saying in a peremptory tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Maggie, you just listen. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t I a good brother to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-ye-es,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Maggie, her chin rising and falling convulsedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I think about your fish-line all this quarter, and mean to buy\r\nit, and saved my money o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go halves in the\r\ntoffee, and Spouncer fought me because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-ye-es\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x94lo-lo-love you so, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re a naughty girl. Last holidays you licked the paint off my\r\nlozenge-box, and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my\r\nfish-line down when I\xe2\x80\x99d set you to watch it, and you pushed your head\r\nthrough my kite, all for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99d minded what you were doing. And\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a naughty girl, and you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go fishing with me to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away from Maggie toward the\r\nmill, meaning to greet Luke there, and complain to him of Harry.\r\n\r\nMaggie stood motionless, except from her sobs, for a minute or two;\r\nthen she turned round and ran into the house, and up to her attic,\r\nwhere she sat on the floor and laid her head against the worm-eaten\r\nshelf, with a crushing sense of misery. Tom was come home, and she had\r\nthought how happy she should be; and now he was cruel to her. What use\r\nwas anything if Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t love her? Oh, he was very cruel! Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nwanted to give him the money, and said how very sorry she was? She knew\r\nshe was naughty to her mother, but she had never been naughty to\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x94had never _meant_ to be naughty to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie sobbed aloud, finding a wretched pleasure in\r\nthe hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the\r\nattic. She never thought of beating or grinding her Fetish; she was too\r\nmiserable to be angry.\r\n\r\nThese bitter sorrows of childhood! when sorrow is all new and strange,\r\nwhen hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks, and\r\nthe space from summer to summer seems measureless.\r\n\r\nMaggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic, and it must be\r\ntea-time, and they were all having their tea, and not thinking of her.\r\nWell, then, she would stay up there and starve herself,\xe2\x80\x94hide herself\r\nbehind the tub, and stay there all night,\xe2\x80\x94and then they would all be\r\nfrightened, and Tom would be sorry. Thus Maggie thought in the pride of\r\nher heart, as she crept behind the tub; but presently she began to cry\r\nagain at the idea that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind her being there. If she went\r\ndown again to Tom now\xe2\x80\x94would he forgive her? Perhaps her father would be\r\nthere, and he would take her part. But then she wanted Tom to forgive\r\nher because he loved her, not because his father told him. No, she\r\nwould never go down if Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to fetch her. This resolution\r\nlasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the tub; but\r\nthen the need of being loved\xe2\x80\x94the strongest need in poor Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94began to wrestle with her pride, and soon threw it. She crept\r\nfrom behind her tub into the twilight of the long attic, but just then\r\nshe heard a quick foot-step on the stairs.\r\n\r\nTom had been too much interested in his talk with Luke, in going the\r\nround of the premises, walking in and out where he pleased, and\r\nwhittling sticks without any particular reason,\xe2\x80\x94except that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwhittle sticks at school,\xe2\x80\x94to think of Maggie and the effect his anger\r\nhad produced on her. He meant to punish her, and that business having\r\nbeen performed, he occupied himself with other matters, like a\r\npractical person. But when he had been called in to tea, his father\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where\xe2\x80\x99s the little wench?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs Tulliver, almost at the\r\nsame moment, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your little sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94both of them having\r\nsupposed that Maggie and Tom had been together all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x9ctell\xe2\x80\x9d of Maggie, though he\r\nwas angry with her; for Tom Tulliver was a lad of honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she been playing with you all this while?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfather. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d been thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing but your coming home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her this two hours,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom, commencing on the\r\nplumcake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness heart; she\xe2\x80\x99s got drownded!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, rising\r\nfrom her seat and running to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you let her do so?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as became a fearful woman,\r\naccusing she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whom of she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, she\xe2\x80\x99s none drownded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been naughty\r\nto her, I doubt, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthe house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps up in that attic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9ca-singing and talking\r\nto herself, and forgetting all about meal-times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go and fetch her down, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply,\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nperspicacity or his fatherly fondness for Maggie making him suspect\r\nthat the lad had been hard upon \xe2\x80\x9cthe little un,\xe2\x80\x9d else she would never\r\nhave left his side. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd be good to her, do you hear? Else I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\r\nknow better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom never disobeyed his father, for Mr Tulliver was a peremptory man,\r\nand, as he said, would never let anybody get hold of his whip-hand; but\r\nhe went out rather sullenly, carrying his piece of plumcake, and not\r\nintending to reprieve Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s punishment, which was no more than she\r\ndeserved. Tom was only thirteen, and had no decided views in grammar\r\nand arithmetic, regarding them for the most part as open questions, but\r\nhe was particularly clear and positive on one point,\xe2\x80\x94namely, that he\r\nwould punish everybody who deserved it. Why, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded\r\nbeing punished himself if he deserved it; but, then, he never _did_\r\ndeserve it.\r\n\r\nIt was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s step, then, that Maggie heard on the stairs, when her need\r\nof love had triumphed over her pride, and she was going down with her\r\nswollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity. At least her father\r\nwould stroke her head and say, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, my wench.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a\r\nwonderful subduer, this need of love,\xe2\x80\x94this hunger of the heart,\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nperemptory as that other hunger by which Nature forces us to submit to\r\nthe yoke, and change the face of the world.\r\n\r\nBut she knew Tom\xe2\x80\x99s step, and her heart began to beat violently with the\r\nsudden shock of hope. He only stood still at the top of the stairs and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, you\xe2\x80\x99re to come down.\xe2\x80\x9d But she rushed to him and clung\r\nround his neck, sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, please forgive me\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill always be good\xe2\x80\x94always remember things\xe2\x80\x94do love me\xe2\x80\x94please, dear\r\nTom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe learn to restrain ourselves as we get older. We keep apart when we\r\nhave quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, and in this\r\nway preserve a dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one side,\r\nand swallowing much grief on the other. We no longer approximate in our\r\nbehaviour to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals, but conduct\r\nourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilised society.\r\nMaggie and Tom were still very much like young animals, and so she\r\ncould rub her cheek against his, and kiss his ear in a random sobbing\r\nway; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to\r\nanswer to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s fondling, so that he behaved with a weakness quite\r\ninconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved.\r\nHe actually began to kiss her in return, and say,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, then, Magsie; here, eat a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 cake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s sobs began to subside, and she put out her mouth for the cake\r\nand bit a piece; and then Tom bit a piece, just for company, and they\r\nate together and rubbed each other\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks and brows and noses\r\ntogether, while they ate, with a humiliating resemblance to two\r\nfriendly ponies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Magsie, and have tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom at last, when there was no\r\nmore cake except what was down-stairs.\r\n\r\nSo ended the sorrows of this day, and the next morning Maggie was\r\ntrotting with her own fishing-rod in one hand and a handle of the\r\nbasket in the other, stepping always, by a peculiar gift, in the\r\nmuddiest places, and looking darkly radiant from under her\r\nbeaver-bonnet because Tom was good to her. She had told Tom, however,\r\nthat she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her, although\r\nshe accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel (it\r\nwas Tom\xe2\x80\x99s private opinion that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter if they did). He\r\nknew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what birds were\r\nmischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the handles of the\r\ngates were to be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very\r\nwonderful,\xe2\x80\x94much more difficult than remembering what was in the books;\r\nand she was rather in awe of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s superiority, for he was the only\r\nperson who called her knowledge \xe2\x80\x9cstuff,\xe2\x80\x9d and did not feel surprised at\r\nher cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a silly\r\nlittle thing; all girls were silly,\xe2\x80\x94they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw a stone so as\r\nto hit anything, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything with a pocket-knife, and were\r\nfrightened at frogs. Still, he was very fond of his sister, and meant\r\nalways to take care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her\r\nwhen she did wrong.\r\n\r\nThey were on their way to the Round Pool,\xe2\x80\x94that wonderful pool, which\r\nthe floods had made a long while ago. No one knew how deep it was; and\r\nit was mysterious, too, that it should be almost a perfect round,\r\nframed in with willows and tall reeds, so that the water was only to be\r\nseen when you got close to the brink. The sight of the old favourite\r\nspot always heightened Tom\xe2\x80\x99s good humour, and he spoke to Maggie in the\r\nmost amicable whispers, as he opened the precious basket and prepared\r\ntheir tackle. He threw her line for her, and put the rod into her hand.\r\nMaggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook,\r\nand the large ones to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s. But she had forgotten all about the fish,\r\nand was looking dreamily at the glassy water, when Tom said, in a loud\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, look, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d and came running to prevent her from\r\nsnatching her line away.\r\n\r\nMaggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong, as\r\nusual, but presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench\r\nbouncing on the grass.\r\n\r\nTom was excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Magsie, you little duck! Empty the basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom\r\ncalled her Magsie, and was pleased with her. There was nothing to mar\r\nher delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened\r\nto the light dripping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle\r\nrustling, as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy\r\nwhisperings also. Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to\r\nsit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded. She never knew she\r\nhad a bite till Tom told her; but she liked fishing very much.\r\n\r\nIt was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down\r\ntogether, with no thought that life would ever change much for them;\r\nthey would only get bigger and not go to school, and it would always be\r\nlike the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of each\r\nother. And the mill with its booming; the great chestnut-tree under\r\nwhich they played at houses; their own little river, the Ripple, where\r\nthe banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing the water-rats,\r\nwhile Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds, which she\r\nforgot and dropped afterward; above all, the great Floss, along which\r\nthey wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing spring-tide,\r\nthe awful Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the Great Ash\r\nwhich had once wailed and groaned like a man, these things would always\r\nbe just the same to them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who\r\nlived on any other spot of the globe; and Maggie, when she read about\r\nChristiana passing \xe2\x80\x9cthe river over which there is no bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d always\r\nsaw the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.\r\n\r\nLife did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in\r\nbelieving that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always\r\nmake part of their lives. We could never have loved the earth so well\r\nif we had had no childhood in it,\xe2\x80\x94if it were not the earth where the\r\nsame flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our\r\ntiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass; the same hips\r\nand haws on the autumn\xe2\x80\x99s hedgerows; the same redbreasts that we used to\r\ncall \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s birds,\xe2\x80\x9d because they did no harm to the precious crops.\r\nWhat novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known,\r\nand _loved_ because it is known?\r\n\r\nThe wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown\r\nfoliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers\r\nand the blue-eyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet, what grove\r\nof tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petalled\r\nblossoms, could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as\r\nthis home scene? These familiar flowers, these well-remembered\r\nbird-notes, this sky, with its fitful brightness, these furrowed and\r\ngrassy fields, each with a sort of personality given to it by the\r\ncapricious hedgerows,\xe2\x80\x94such things as these are the mother-tongue of our\r\nimagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle,\r\ninextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left\r\nbehind them. Our delight in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass\r\nto-day might be no more than the faint perception of wearied souls, if\r\nit were not for the sunshine and the grass in the far-off years which\r\nstill live in us, and transform our perception into love.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe Aunts and Uncles Are Coming\r\n\r\nIt was Easter week, and Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s cheesecakes were more\r\nexquisitely light than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cA puff o\xe2\x80\x99 wind \xe2\x80\x99ud make \xe2\x80\x99em blow about\r\nlike feathers,\xe2\x80\x9d Kezia the housemaid said, feeling proud to live under a\r\nmistress who could make such pastry; so that no season or circumstances\r\ncould have been more propitious for a family party, even if it had not\r\nbeen advisable to consult sister Glegg and sister Pullet about Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d as lief not invite sister Deane this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor she\xe2\x80\x99s as jealous and having as can be, and\xe2\x80\x99s allays trying to make\r\nthe worst o\xe2\x80\x99 my poor children to their aunts and uncles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cask her to come. I never hardly get a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 talk with Deane now; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had him this six months. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nit matter what she says? My children need be beholding to nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you allays say, Mr Tulliver; but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 _your_ side, neither aunt nor uncle, to leave \xe2\x80\x99em so much as a\r\nfive-pound note for a leggicy. And there\xe2\x80\x99s sister Glegg, and sister\r\nPullet too, saving money unknown, for they put by all their own\r\ninterest and butter-money too; their husbands buy \xe2\x80\x99em everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs\r\nTulliver was a mild woman, but even a sheep will face about a little\r\nwhen she has lambs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTchuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes a big loaf when there\xe2\x80\x99s many to\r\nbreakfast. What signifies your sisters\xe2\x80\x99 bits o\xe2\x80\x99 money when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nhalf-a-dozen nevvies and nieces to divide it among? And your sister\r\nDeane won\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x99em to leave all to one, I reckon, and make the country\r\ncry shame on \xe2\x80\x99em when they are dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she won\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x99em to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my\r\nchildren are so awk\xe2\x80\x99ard wi\xe2\x80\x99 their aunts and uncles. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s ten times\r\nnaughtier when they come than she is other days, and Tom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, bless him!\xe2\x80\x94though it\xe2\x80\x99s more nat\xe2\x80\x99ral in a boy than a gell. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s Lucy Deane\xe2\x80\x99s such a good child,\xe2\x80\x94you may set her on a stool, and\r\nthere she\xe2\x80\x99ll sit for an hour together, and never offer to get off. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help loving the child as if she was my own; and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore like _my_ child than sister Deane\xe2\x80\x99s, for she\xe2\x80\x99d allays a very poor\r\ncolour for one of our family, sister Deane had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re fond o\xe2\x80\x99 the child, ask her father and mother to\r\nbring her with \xe2\x80\x99em. And won\xe2\x80\x99t you ask their aunt and uncle Moss too,\r\nand some o\xe2\x80\x99 _their_ children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, Mr Tulliver, why, there\xe2\x80\x99d be eight people besides the\r\nchildren, and I must put two more leaves i\xe2\x80\x99 the table, besides reaching\r\ndown more o\xe2\x80\x99 the dinner-service; and you know as well as I do as _my_\r\nsisters and _your_ sister don\xe2\x80\x99t suit well together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, do as you like, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, taking up his\r\nhat and walking out to the mill. Few wives were more submissive than\r\nMrs Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations; but\r\nshe had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable\r\nfamily indeed,\xe2\x80\x94as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the\r\nnext to it. The Miss Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their\r\nheads very high, and no one was surprised the two eldest had married so\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x94not at an early age, for that was not the practice of the Dodson\r\nfamily. There were particular ways of doing everything in that family:\r\nparticular ways of bleaching the linen, of making the cowslip wine,\r\ncuring the hams, and keeping the bottled gooseberries; so that no\r\ndaughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having\r\nbeen born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a Watson. Funerals were\r\nalways conducted with peculiar propriety in the Dodson family: the\r\nhat-bands were never of a blue shade, the gloves never split at the\r\nthumb, everybody was a mourner who ought to be, and there were always\r\nscarfs for the bearers. When one of the family was in trouble or\r\nsickness, all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member, usually at\r\nthe same time, and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable\r\ntruths that correct family feeling dictated; if the illness or trouble\r\nwas the sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s own fault, it was not in the practice of the Dodson\r\nfamily to shrink from saying so. In short, there was in this family a\r\npeculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household\r\nmanagement and social demeanour, and the only bitter circumstance\r\nattending this superiority was a painful inability to approve the\r\ncondiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the Dodson\r\ntradition. A female Dodson, when in \xe2\x80\x9cstrange houses,\xe2\x80\x9d always ate dry\r\nbread with her tea, and declined any sort of preserves, having no\r\nconfidence in the butter, and thinking that the preserves had probably\r\nbegun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling. There were some\r\nDodsons less like the family than others, that was admitted; but in so\r\nfar as they were \xe2\x80\x9ckin,\xe2\x80\x9d they were of necessity better than those who\r\nwere \xe2\x80\x9cno kin.\xe2\x80\x9d And it is remarkable that while no individual Dodson was\r\nsatisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was satisfied, not\r\nonly with him or herself, but with the Dodsons collectively. The\r\nfeeblest member of a family\xe2\x80\x94the one who has the least character\xe2\x80\x94is\r\noften the merest epitome of the family habits and traditions; and Mrs\r\nTulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer, so\r\nlong as it is anything, is only describable as very weak ale: and\r\nthough she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her\r\nelder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly\r\nreproaches, it was not in Mrs Tulliver to be an innovator on the family\r\nideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child\r\nwho took after her own family, at least in his features and complexion,\r\nin liking salt and in eating beans, which a Tulliver never did.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was\r\nas far from appreciating his \xe2\x80\x9ckin\xe2\x80\x9d on the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side as Maggie\r\nherself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the\r\nmost portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and\r\nuncles were coming,\xe2\x80\x94a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced\r\nthe gloomiest views of his future. It was rather hard on Maggie that\r\nTom always absconded without letting her into the secret, but the\r\nweaker sex are acknowledged to be serious _impedimenta_ in cases of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the day before the aunts and uncles were coming, there\r\nwere such various and suggestive scents, as of plumcakes in the oven\r\nand jellies in the hot state, mingled with the aroma of gravy, that it\r\nwas impossible to feel altogether gloomy: there was hope in the air.\r\nTom and Maggie made several inroads into the kitchen, and, like other\r\nmarauders, were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed\r\nto carry away a sufficient load of booty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, as they sat on the boughs of the elder-tree, eating\r\ntheir jam-puffs, \xe2\x80\x9cshall you run away to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, slowly, when he had finished his puff, and was eying\r\nthe third, which was to be divided between them,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom? Because Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, opening his pocket-knife and holding it over the puff,\r\nwith his head on one side in a dubitative manner. (It was a difficult\r\nproblem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _I_ care about Lucy? She\xe2\x80\x99s only a girl,\xe2\x80\x94_she_ can\xe2\x80\x99t play at\r\nbandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the tipsy-cake, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, exerting her hypothetic\r\npowers, while she leaned forward toward Tom with her eyes fixed on the\r\nhovering knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you silly, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be good the day after. It\xe2\x80\x99s the pudden. I know\r\nwhat the pudden\xe2\x80\x99s to be,\xe2\x80\x94apricot roll-up\xe2\x80\x94O my buttons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this interjection, the knife descended on the puff, and it was in\r\ntwo, but the result was not satisfactory to Tom, for he still eyed the\r\nhalves doubtfully. At last he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut your eyes, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never mind what for. Shut \xe2\x80\x99em when I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, which\xe2\x80\x99ll you have, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94right hand or left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have that with the jam run out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, keeping her eyes\r\nshut to please Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like that, you silly. You may have it if it comes to\r\nyou fair, but I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t give it you without. Right or left,\xe2\x80\x94you choose,\r\nnow. Ha-a-a!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a tone of exasperation, as Maggie peeped.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou keep your eyes shut, now, else you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s power of sacrifice did not extend so far; indeed, I fear she\r\ncared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff,\r\nthan that he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit. So\r\nshe shut her eyes quite close, till Tom told her to \xe2\x80\x9csay which,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen she said, \xe2\x80\x9cLeft hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in rather a bitter tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the bit with the jam run out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; here, take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, firmly, handing, decidedly the best\r\npiece to Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please, Tom, have it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94I like the other; please take\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, almost crossly, beginning on his own\r\ninferior piece.\r\n\r\nMaggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate\r\nup her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity. But Tom\r\nhad finished first, and had to look on while Maggie ate her last morsel\r\nor two, feeling in himself a capacity for more. Maggie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Tom\r\nwas looking at her; she was seesawing on the elder-bough, lost to\r\nalmost everything but a vague sense of jam and idleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you greedy thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when she had swallowed the last\r\nmorsel. He was conscious of having acted very fairly, and thought she\r\nought to have considered this, and made up to him for it. He would have\r\nrefused a bit of hers beforehand, but one is naturally at a different\r\npoint of view before and after one\xe2\x80\x99s own share of puff is swallowed.\r\n\r\nMaggie turned quite pale. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to ask you for a bit, you greedy. You might have\r\nthought of it without, when you knew I gave you the best bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wanted you to have it; you know I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in an\r\ninjured tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to do what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fair, like Spouncer. He\r\nalways takes the best bit, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t punch him for it; and if you\r\nchoose the best with your eyes shut, he changes his hands. But if I go\r\nhalves, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go \xe2\x80\x99em fair; only I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a greedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this cutting innuendo, Tom jumped down from his bough, and threw a\r\nstone with a \xe2\x80\x9choigh!\xe2\x80\x9d as a friendly attention to Yap, who had also been\r\nlooking on while the eatables vanished, with an agitation of his ears\r\nand feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness. Yet the\r\nexcellent dog accepted Tom\xe2\x80\x99s attention with as much alacrity as if he\r\nhad been treated quite generously.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which\r\ndistinguishes the human being, and places him at a proud distance from\r\nthe most melancholy chimpanzee, sat still on her bough, and gave\r\nherself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach. She would have\r\ngiven the world not to have eaten all her puff, and to have saved some\r\nof it for Tom. Not but that the puff was very nice, for Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s palate\r\nwas not at all obtuse, but she would have gone without it many times\r\nover, sooner than Tom should call her greedy and be cross with her. And\r\nhe had said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it, and she ate it without thinking; how\r\ncould she help it? The tears flowed so plentifully that Maggie saw\r\nnothing around her for the next ten minutes; but by that time\r\nresentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation, and she\r\njumped from her bough to look for Tom. He was no longer in the paddock\r\nbehind the rickyard; where was he likely to be gone, and Yap with him?\r\nMaggie ran to the high bank against the great holly-tree, where she\r\ncould see far away toward the Floss. There was Tom; but her heart sank\r\nagain as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river, and\r\nthat he had another companion besides Yap,\xe2\x80\x94naughty Bob Jakin, whose\r\nofficial, if not natural, function of frightening the birds was just\r\nnow at a standstill. Maggie felt sure that Bob was wicked, without very\r\ndistinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob\xe2\x80\x99s mother was a\r\ndreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the\r\nriver; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed\r\nout a brindled dog that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop barking; and when Bob\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\ncame out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them not to\r\nbe frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her\r\nheart beat with terror. Maggie thought it very likely that the round\r\nhouse had snakes on the floor, and bats in the bedroom; for she had\r\nseen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside\r\nit, and another time he had a handful of young bats: altogether, he was\r\nan irregular character, perhaps even slightly diabolical, judging from\r\nhis intimacy with snakes and bats; and to crown all, when Tom had Bob\r\nfor a companion, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind about Maggie, and would never let her\r\ngo with him.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s company. How could it be\r\notherwise? Bob knew, directly he saw a bird\xe2\x80\x99s egg, whether it was a\r\nswallow\xe2\x80\x99s, or a tomtit\xe2\x80\x99s, or a yellow-hammer\xe2\x80\x99s; he found out all the\r\nwasps\xe2\x80\x99 nests, and could set all sorts of traps; he could climb the trees\r\nlike a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs\r\nand stoats; and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty,\r\nsuch as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after the sheep,\r\nand killing a cat that was wandering _incognito_. Such qualities in an\r\ninferior, who could always be treated with authority in spite of his\r\nsuperior knowingness, had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom; and\r\nevery holiday-time Maggie was sure to have days of grief because he had\r\ngone off with Bob.\r\n\r\nWell! there was no hope for it; he was gone now, and Maggie could think\r\nof no comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the hedgerow,\r\nand fancy it was all different, refashioning her little world into just\r\nwhat she should like it to be.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she took\r\nher opium.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach\r\nwhich he had left in her heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he\r\nhad met accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching in a\r\nneighbouring barn. Bob knew all about this particular affair, and spoke\r\nof the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested\r\nof all manly feeling, or pitiably ignorant of rat-catching, can fail to\r\nimagine. For a person suspected of preternatural wickedness, Bob was\r\nreally not so very villanous-looking; there was even something\r\nagreeable in his snub-nosed face, with its close-curled border of red\r\nhair. But then his trousers were always rolled up at the knee, for the\r\nconvenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his virtue,\r\nsupposing it to exist, was undeniably \xe2\x80\x9cvirtue in rags,\xe2\x80\x9d which, on the\r\nauthority even of bilious philosophers, who think all well-dressed\r\nmerit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain unrecognised (perhaps\r\nbecause it is seen so seldom).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the chap as owns the ferrets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, in a hoarse treble\r\nvoice, as he shuffled along, keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river,\r\nlike an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nlives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, he does. He\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest\r\nrot-catcher anywhere, he is. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner, be a rot-catcher nor anything,\r\nI would. The moles is nothing to the rots. But Lors! you mun ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nferrets. Dogs is no good. Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s that dog, now!\xe2\x80\x9d Bob continued,\r\npointing with an air of disgust toward Yap, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s no more good wi\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nrot nor nothin\xe2\x80\x99. I see it myself, I did, at the rot-catchin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nfeyther\xe2\x80\x99s barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his tail in\r\nand shrank close to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s leg, who felt a little hurt for him, but had\r\nnot the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for\r\na dog who made so poor a figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYap\xe2\x80\x99s no good at sport. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have regular good dogs\r\nfor rats and everything, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve done school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHev ferrets, Measter Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, eagerly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthem white ferrets wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\npink eyes; Lors, you might catch your own rots, an\xe2\x80\x99 you might put a rot\r\nin a cage wi\xe2\x80\x99 a ferret, an\xe2\x80\x99 see \xe2\x80\x99em fight, you might. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndo, I know, an\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\x99ud be better fun a\xe2\x80\x99most nor seein\xe2\x80\x99 two chaps\r\nfight,\xe2\x80\x94if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t them chaps as sold cakes an\xe2\x80\x99 oranges at the Fair,\r\nas the things flew out o\xe2\x80\x99 their baskets, an\xe2\x80\x99 some o\xe2\x80\x99 the cakes was\r\nsmashed\xe2\x80\x94But they tasted just as good,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bob, by way of note or\r\naddendum, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I say, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a tone of deliberation, \xe2\x80\x9cferrets are\r\nnasty biting things,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll bite a fellow without being set on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLors! why that\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty on \xe2\x80\x99em. If a chap lays hold o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nferret, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be long before he hollows out a good un, _he_ won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in\r\ntheir walk. It was the plunging of some small body in the water from\r\namong the neighbouring bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat, Bob\r\nintimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoigh! Yap,\xe2\x80\x94hoigh! there he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, clapping his hands, as the\r\nlittle black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank. \xe2\x80\x9cSeize\r\nhim, lad! seize him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows, but declined to plunge,\r\ntrying whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! you coward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, and kicked him over, feeling humiliated as\r\na sportsman to possess so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained from\r\nremark and passed on, choosing, however, to walk in the shallow edge of\r\nthe overflowing river by way of change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s none so full now, the Floss isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, as he kicked the\r\nwater up before him, with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, last \xe2\x80\x99ear, the meadows was all one sheet o\xe2\x80\x99 water, they was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition between\r\nstatements that were really accordant,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut there was a big flood once,\r\nwhen the Round Pool was made. _I_ know there was, \xe2\x80\x99cause father says\r\nso. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all over the\r\nfields ever such a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care about a flood comin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the\r\nwater, no more nor the land. I\xe2\x80\x99d swim, _I_ would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, his\r\nimagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of\r\nit, like Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, and keep plenty to eat in it,\xe2\x80\x94rabbits and\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x94all ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. And I\xe2\x80\x99d take you in, if I saw you swimming,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nin the tone of a benevolent patron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI aren\xe2\x80\x99t frighted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, to whom hunger did not appear so\r\nappalling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d get in an\xe2\x80\x99 knock the rabbits on th\xe2\x80\x99 head when you\r\nwanted to eat \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and I should have halfpence, and we\xe2\x80\x99d play at heads-and-tails,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tom, not contemplating the possibility that this recreation might\r\nhave fewer charms for his mature age. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d divide fair to begin with,\r\nand then we\xe2\x80\x99d see who\xe2\x80\x99d win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a halfpenny o\xe2\x80\x99 my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, proudly, coming out of the\r\nwater and tossing his halfpenny in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cYeads or tails?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTails,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, instantly fired with the desire to win.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s yeads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny as it fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, loudly and peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me the\r\nhalfpenny; I\xe2\x80\x99ve won it fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, holding it tight in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you; see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t make me do nothing, you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you care, you cheat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, collaring Bob and\r\nshaking him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get out wi\xe2\x80\x99 you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, giving Tom a kick.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s blood was thoroughly up: he went at Bob with a lunge and threw\r\nhim down, but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom\r\ndown after him. They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or\r\ntwo, till Tom, pinning Bob down by the shoulders, thought he had the\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_, say you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me the halfpenny now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\ndifficulty, while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment Yap, who had been running on before, returned\r\nbarking to the scene of action, and saw a favourable opportunity for\r\nbiting Bob\xe2\x80\x99s bare leg not only with inpunity but with honour. The pain\r\nfrom Yap\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his\r\nhold, gave it a fiercer tenacity, and with a new exertion of his force\r\nhe pushed Tom backward and got uppermost. But now Yap, who could get no\r\nsufficient purchase before, set his teeth in a new place, so that Bob,\r\nharassed in this way, let go his hold of Tom, and, almost throttling\r\nYap, flung him into the river. By this time Tom was up again, and\r\nbefore Bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of swinging\r\nYap, Tom fell upon him, threw him down, and got his knees firmly on\r\nBob\xe2\x80\x99s chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give me the halfpenny now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t take it; you give it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob took the halfpenny out of his pocket, and threw it away from him on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nTom loosed his hold, and left Bob to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere the halfpenny lies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your halfpenny; I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have kept it. But you wanted to cheat; I hate a cheat. I\r\nsha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go along with you any more,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning round homeward,\r\nnot without casting a regret toward the rat-catching and other\r\npleasures which he must relinquish along with Bob\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may let it alone, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob called out after him. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall cheat\r\nif I like; there\xe2\x80\x99s no fun i\xe2\x80\x99 playing else; and I know where there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngoldfinch\xe2\x80\x99s nest, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t. An\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re a nasty\r\nfightin\xe2\x80\x99 turkey-cock, you are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom walked on without looking around, and Yap followed his example, the\r\ncold bath having moderated his passions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, then, wi\xe2\x80\x99 your drowned dog; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t own such a\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x94_I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, getting louder, in a last effort to\r\nsustain his defiance. But Tom was not to be provoked into turning\r\nround, and Bob\xe2\x80\x99s voice began to falter a little as he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99n gi\xe2\x80\x99en you everything, an\xe2\x80\x99 showed you everything, an\xe2\x80\x99 niver\r\nwanted nothin\xe2\x80\x99 from you. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s your horn-handed knife, then as\r\nyou gi\xe2\x80\x99en me.\xe2\x80\x9d Here Bob flung the knife as far as he could after Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretreating footsteps. But it produced no effect, except the sense in\r\nBob\xe2\x80\x99s mind that there was a terrible void in his lot, now that knife\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHe stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared\r\nbehind the hedge. The knife would do no good on the ground there; it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind compared with the love of a pocket-knife. His very fingers sent\r\nentreating thrills that he would go and clutch that familiar rough\r\nbuck\xe2\x80\x99s-horn handle, which they had so often grasped for mere affection,\r\nas it lay idle in his pocket. And there were two blades, and they had\r\njust been sharpened! What is life without a pocket-knife to him who has\r\nonce tasted a higher existence? No; to throw the handle after the\r\nhatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation, but to throw one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket-knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a\r\nhyperbole, or throwing beyond the mark. So Bob shuffled back to the\r\nspot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt, and felt quite a new\r\npleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation, in\r\nopening one blade after the other, and feeling their edge with his\r\nwell-hardened thumb. Poor Bob! he was not sensitive on the point of\r\nhonour, not a chivalrous character. That fine moral aroma would not\r\nhave been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard, which\r\nwas the very focus or heart of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s world, even if it could have made\r\nitself perceptible there; yet, for all that, he was not utterly a sneak\r\nand a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided.\r\n\r\nBut Tom, you perceive, was rather a Rhadamanthine personage, having\r\nmore than the usual share of boy\xe2\x80\x99s justice in him,\xe2\x80\x94the justice that\r\ndesires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is\r\ntroubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts.\r\nMaggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home, which checked her joy\r\nat his coming so much sooner than she had expected, and she dared\r\nhardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small\r\ngravel-stones into the mill-dam. It is not pleasant to give up a\r\nrat-catching when you have set your mind on it. But if Tom had told his\r\nstrongest feeling at that moment, he would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do just the\r\nsame again.\xe2\x80\x9d That was his usual mode of viewing his past actions;\r\nwhereas Maggie was always wishing she had done something different.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nEnter the Aunts and Uncles\r\n\r\nThe Dodsons were certainly a handsome family, and Mrs Glegg was not the\r\nleast handsome of the sisters. As she sat in Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair,\r\nno impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she\r\nhad a very comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered\r\ntheir aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the\r\nadvantages of costume, for though, as she often observed, no woman had\r\nbetter clothes, it was not her way to wear her new things out before\r\nher old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their best\r\nthread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs Glegg died, it would be found\r\nthat she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her\r\nwardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs Wooll of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\nbought in her life, although Mrs Wooll wore her lace before it was paid\r\nfor. So of her curled fronts: Mrs Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and\r\ncrispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various\r\ndegrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from\r\nunder a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike\r\nand unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular.\r\nOccasionally, indeed, Mrs Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a\r\nweek-day visit, but not at a sister\xe2\x80\x99s house; especially not at Mrs\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s, who, since her marriage, had hurt her sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\ngreatly by wearing her own hair, though, as Mrs Glegg observed to Mrs\r\nDeane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband always going to\r\nlaw, might have been expected to know better. But Bessy was always\r\nweak!\r\n\r\nSo if Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual, she\r\nhad a design under it: she intended the most pointed and cutting\r\nallusion to Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s bunches of blond curls, separated from each\r\nother by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting. Mrs\r\nTulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s unkindness on\r\nthe subject of these unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking\r\nthe handsomer for them naturally administered support. Mrs Glegg chose\r\nto wear her bonnet in the house to-day,\xe2\x80\x94untied and tilted slightly, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit, and\r\nhappened to be in a severe humour: she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what draughts there\r\nmight be in strange houses. For the same reason she wore a small sable\r\ntippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and was very far from\r\nmeeting across her well-formed chest, while her long neck was protected\r\nby a _chevaux-de-frise_ of miscellaneous frilling. One would need to be\r\nlearned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of\r\nthem Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s slate-coloured silk gown must have been; but from\r\ncertain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor\r\nabout it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it\r\nbelonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently\r\ninto wear.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many-doubled\r\nchain round her fingers, and observed to Mrs Tulliver, who had just\r\nreturned from a visit to the kitchen, that whatever it might be by\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s clocks and watches, it was gone half-past twelve by\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what ails sister Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt used to be\r\nthe way in our family for one to be as early as another,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\r\nwas so in my poor father\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x94and not for one sister to sit half an\r\nhour before the others came. But if the ways o\xe2\x80\x99 the family are altered,\r\nit sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be _my_ fault; _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ never be the one to come into a house\r\nwhen all the rest are going away. I wonder _at_ sister Deane,\xe2\x80\x94she used\r\nto be more like me. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take my advice, Bessy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll put the\r\ndinner forrard a bit, sooner than put it back, because folks are late\r\nas ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 known better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, there\xe2\x80\x99s no fear but what they\xe2\x80\x99ll be all here in time,\r\nsister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, in her mild-peevish tone. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dinner won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe ready till half-past one. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s long for you to wait, let me\r\nfetch you a cheesecake and a glass o\xe2\x80\x99 wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, with a bitter smile and a scarcely\r\nperceptible toss of her head, \xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought you\xe2\x80\x99d known your\r\nown sister better. I never _did_ eat between meals, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going\r\nto begin. Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your dinner at\r\nhalf-past one, when you might have it at one. You was never brought up\r\nin that way, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jane, what can I do? Mr Tulliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like his dinner before\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock, but I put it half an hour earlier because o\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know how it is with husbands,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re for putting\r\neverything off; they\xe2\x80\x99ll put the dinner off till after tea, if they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot wives as are weak enough to give in to such work; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity\r\nfor you, Bessy, as you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got more strength o\xe2\x80\x99 mind. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be well\r\nif your children don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer for it. And I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve not gone and\r\ngot a great dinner for us,\xe2\x80\x94going to expense for your sisters, as \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nsooner eat a crust o\xe2\x80\x99 dry bread nor help to ruin you with extravagance.\r\nI wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t take pattern by your sister Deane; she\xe2\x80\x99s far more\r\nsensible. And here you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two children to provide for, and your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s spent your fortin i\xe2\x80\x99 going to law, and\xe2\x80\x99s likely to spend his\r\nown too. A boiled joint, as you could make broth of for the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs Glegg added, in a tone of emphatic protest, \xe2\x80\x9cand a plain pudding,\r\nwith a spoonful o\xe2\x80\x99 sugar, and no spice, \xe2\x80\x99ud be far more becoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith sister Glegg in this humour, there was a cheerful prospect for the\r\nday. Mrs Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her, any\r\nmore than a water-fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner\r\ncan be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones. But this point of\r\nthe dinner was a tender one, and not at all new, so that Mrs Tulliver\r\ncould make the same answer she had often made before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Tulliver says he always _will_ have a good dinner for his friends\r\nwhile he can pay for it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s a right to do as he likes\r\nin his own house, sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy, _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t leave your children enough out o\xe2\x80\x99 my savings to\r\nkeep \xe2\x80\x99em from ruin. And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look to having any o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney, for it\xe2\x80\x99s well if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go first,\xe2\x80\x94he comes of a long-lived\r\nfamily; and if he was to die and leave me well for my life, he\xe2\x80\x99d tie\r\nall the money up to go back to his own kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of wheels while Mrs Glegg was speaking was an interruption\r\nhighly welcome to Mrs Tulliver, who hastened out to receive sister\r\nPullet; it must be sister Pullet, because the sound was that of a\r\nfour-wheel.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the\r\nthought of the \xe2\x80\x9cfour-wheel.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a strong opinion on that subject.\r\n\r\nSister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before Mrs\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s door, and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a\r\nfew more before getting out; for though her husband and Mrs Tulliver\r\nstood ready to support her, she sat still and shook her head sadly, as\r\nshe looked through her tears at the vague distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whativer is the matter, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver. She was not\r\nan imaginative woman, but it occurred to her that the large\r\ntoilet-glass in sister Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s best bedroom was possibly broken for\r\nthe second time.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply but a further shake of the head, as Mrs Pullet\r\nslowly rose and got down from the chaise, not without casting a glance\r\nat Mr Pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from\r\ninjury. Mr Pullet was a small man, with a high nose, small twinkling\r\neyes, and thin lips, in a fresh-looking suit of black and a white\r\ncravat, that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher\r\nprinciple than that of mere personal ease. He bore about the same\r\nrelation to his tall, good-looking wife, with her balloon sleeves,\r\nabundant mantle, and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet, as a\r\nsmall fishing-smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread.\r\n\r\nIt is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity\r\nintroduced into the emotions by a high state of civilisation, the sight\r\nof a fashionably dressed female in grief. From the sorrow of a\r\nHottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves, with several\r\nbracelets on each arm, an architectural bonnet, and delicate ribbon\r\nstrings, what a long series of gradations! In the enlightened child of\r\ncivilisation the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and\r\nvaried in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting problem\r\nto the analytic mind. If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by\r\nthe mist of tears, she were to walk with a too devious step through a\r\ndoor-place, she might crush her buckram sleeves too, and the deep\r\nconsciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by\r\nwhich she takes a line that just clears the door-post. Perceiving that\r\nthe tears are hurrying fast, she unpins her strings and throws them\r\nlanguidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the deepest\r\ngloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once\r\nmore have a charm. As the tears subside a little, and with her head\r\nleaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet, she\r\nendures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else\r\na weariness, has itself become weary; she looks down pensively at her\r\nbracelets, and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity\r\nwhich would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm\r\nand healthy state.\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the latitude\r\nof her shoulders (at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an\r\ninstructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the\r\nshoulders), and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest\r\nof fresh tears as she advanced into the parlour where Mrs Glegg was\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sister, you\xe2\x80\x99re late; what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, rather\r\nsharply, as they shook hands.\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet sat down, lifting up her mantle carefully behind, before she\r\nanswered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d unconsciously using an impressive figure of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the glass this time, then,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDied the day before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs Pullet; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 her legs\r\nwas as thick as my body,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with deep sadness, after a pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d tapped her no end o\xe2\x80\x99 times, and the water\xe2\x80\x94they say you might\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 swum in it, if you\xe2\x80\x99d liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sophy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, then, whoever she may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Glegg, with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally clear\r\nand decided; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t think who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking of, for my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, sighing and shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t another such a dropsy in the parish. _I_ know as it\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nMrs Sutton o\xe2\x80\x99 the Twentylands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s no kin o\xe2\x80\x99 yours, nor much acquaintance as I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heared\r\nof,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, who always cried just as much as was proper when\r\nanything happened to her own \xe2\x80\x9ckin,\xe2\x80\x9d but not on other occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so much acquaintance as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her legs when they was like\r\nbladders. And an old lady as had doubled her money over and over again,\r\nand kept it all in her own management to the last, and had her pocket\r\nwith her keys in under her pillow constant. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t many old\r\n_par_ish\xe2\x80\x99ners like her, I doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they say she\xe2\x80\x99d took as much physic as \xe2\x80\x99ud fill a wagon,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nMr Pullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99d another complaint ever so many years\r\nbefore she had the dropsy, and the doctors couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what it\r\nwas. And she said to me, when I went to see her last Christmas, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs Pullet, if ever you have the dropsy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll think o\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe _did_ say so,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Pullet, beginning to cry bitterly again;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthose were her very words. And she\xe2\x80\x99s to be buried o\xe2\x80\x99 Saturday, and\r\nPullet\xe2\x80\x99s bid to the funeral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, unable any longer to contain her spirit of\r\nrational remonstrance,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSophy, I wonder _at_ you, fretting and injuring\r\nyour health about people as don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to you. Your poor father never\r\ndid so, nor your aunt Frances neither, nor any o\xe2\x80\x99 the family as I ever\r\nheard of. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fret no more than this, if we\xe2\x80\x99d heared as our\r\ncousin Abbott had died sudden without making his will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet was silent, having to finish her crying, and rather\r\nflattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much. It was\r\nnot everybody who could afford to cry so much about their neighbours\r\nwho had left them nothing; but Mrs Pullet had married a gentleman\r\nfarmer, and had leisure and money to carry her crying and everything\r\nelse to the highest pitch of respectability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Sutton didn\xe2\x80\x99t die without making her will, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nPullet, with a confused sense that he was saying something to sanction\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s tears; \xe2\x80\x9cours is a rich parish, but they say there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody\r\nelse to leave as many thousands behind \xe2\x80\x99em as Mrs Sutton. And she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft no leggicies to speak on,\xe2\x80\x94left it all in a lump to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnevvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much good i\xe2\x80\x99 being so rich, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d got none but husband\xe2\x80\x99s kin to leave it to. It\xe2\x80\x99s poor work when\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pinch yourself for. Not as I\xe2\x80\x99m one o\xe2\x80\x99 those as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than other\r\nfolks had reckoned; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor tale when it must go out o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nown family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, who had recovered sufficiently to\r\ntake off her veil and fold it carefully, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a nice sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man as\r\nMrs Sutton has left her money to, for he\xe2\x80\x99s troubled with the asthmy,\r\nand goes to bed every night at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He told me about it\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94as free as could be\xe2\x80\x94one Sunday when he came to our church. He\r\nwears a hareskin on his chest, and has a trembling in his talk,\xe2\x80\x94quite a\r\ngentleman sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man. I told him there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t many months in the year\r\nas I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t under the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hands. And he said, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs Pullet, I can\r\nfeel for you.\xe2\x80\x99 That was what he said,\xe2\x80\x94the very words. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs\r\nPullet, shaking her head at the idea that there were but few who could\r\nenter fully into her experiences in pink mixture and white mixture,\r\nstrong stuff in small bottles, and weak stuff in large bottles, damp\r\nboluses at a shilling, and draughts at eighteenpence. \xe2\x80\x9cSister, I may as\r\nwell go and take my bonnet off now. Did you see as the cap-box was put\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to her husband.\r\n\r\nMr Pullet, by an unaccountable lapse of memory, had forgotten it, and\r\nhastened out, with a stricken conscience, to remedy the omission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it upstairs, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, wishing to go\r\nat once, lest Mrs Glegg should begin to explain her feelings about\r\nSophy\xe2\x80\x99s being the first Dodson who ever ruined her constitution with\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s stuff.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet, and\r\nlooking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head, and\r\ndiscussing millinery in general. This was part of Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s weakness that\r\nstirred Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s sisterly compassion: Bessy went far too well\r\ndressed, considering; and she was too proud to dress her child in the\r\ngood clothing her sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her\r\nwardrobe; it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child,\r\nif it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a pair of shoes. In this particular, however, Mrs Glegg\r\ndid her sister Bessy some injustice, for Mrs Tulliver had really made\r\ngreat efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk\r\nfrock made out of her aunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s, but the results had been such that\r\nMrs Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom; for\r\nMaggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye, had taken an\r\nopportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first Sunday\r\nshe wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she had subsequently\r\npumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to give it a general\r\nresemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces. I must\r\nurge in excuse for Maggie, that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet,\r\nand said she looked like an old Judy. Aunt Pullet, too, made presents\r\nof clothes, but these were always pretty enough to please Maggie as\r\nwell as her mother. Of all her sisters, Mrs Tulliver certainly\r\npreferred her sister Pullet, not without a return of preference; but\r\nMrs Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward children; she\r\nwould do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\ngood and as pretty as sister Deane\xe2\x80\x99s child. Maggie and Tom, on their\r\npart, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not\r\ntheir aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more than once during his\r\nholidays to see either of them. Both his uncles tipped him that once,\r\nof course; but at his aunt Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s there were a great many toads to\r\npelt in the cellar-area, so that he preferred the visit to her. Maggie\r\nshuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them horribly, but she liked her\r\nuncle Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s musical snuff-box. Still, it was agreed by the sisters,\r\nin Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well\r\nwith the Dodson blood; that, in fact, poor Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s children were\r\nTullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion,\r\nwas likely to be as \xe2\x80\x9ccontrairy\xe2\x80\x9d as his father. As for Maggie, she was\r\nthe picture of her aunt Moss, Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x94a large-boned\r\nwoman, who had married as poorly as could be; had no china, and had a\r\nhusband who had much ado to pay his rent. But when Mrs Pullet was alone\r\nwith Mrs Tulliver upstairs, the remarks were naturally to the\r\ndisadvantage of Mrs Glegg, and they agreed, in confidence, that there\r\nwas no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next. But\r\ntheir _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ was curtailed by the appearance of Mrs Deane with\r\nlittle Lucy; and Mrs Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s blond curls were adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that Mrs\r\nDeane, the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have\r\nhad this child, who might have been taken for Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s any day.\r\nAnd Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the\r\nside of Lucy.\r\n\r\nShe did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their\r\nfather and their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very\r\ncarelessly, and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl,\r\nrushed at once to Lucy, who was standing by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\nCertainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to\r\nsuperficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a\r\nconnoisseur might have seen \xe2\x80\x9cpoints\xe2\x80\x9d in her which had a higher promise\r\nfor maturity than Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s natty completeness. It was like the contrast\r\nbetween a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up\r\nthe neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her was\r\nneat,\xe2\x80\x94her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little\r\nstraight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather\r\ndarker than her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy\r\npleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older.\r\nMaggie always looked at Lucy with delight.\r\n\r\nShe was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger\r\nthan children of their own age, and she made the queen of it just like\r\nLucy, with a little crown on her head, and a little sceptre in her\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, after kissing her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with Tom and\r\nme, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Oh, kiss her, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, too, had come up to Lucy, but he was not going to kiss her\xe2\x80\x94no; he\r\ncame up to her with Maggie, because it seemed easier, on the whole,\r\nthan saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d to all those aunts and uncles. He stood\r\nlooking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and\r\nsemi-smile which are common to shy boys when in company,\xe2\x80\x94very much as\r\nif they had come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree of\r\nundress that was quite embarrassing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyday!\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cDo little boys and\r\ngells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts?\r\nThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way when _I_ was a little gell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver,\r\nlooking anxious and melancholy. She wanted to whisper to Maggie a\r\ncommand to go and have her hair brushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how do you do? And I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re good children, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way, as she took their\r\nhands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing their cheeks much\r\nagainst their desire. \xe2\x80\x9cLook up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to\r\nboarding-schools should hold their heads up. Look at me now.\xe2\x80\x9d Tom\r\ndeclined that pleasure apparently, for he tried to draw his hand away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your\r\nshoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she\r\nconsidered them deaf, or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she\r\nthought, of making them feel that they were accountable creatures, and\r\nmight be a salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s children were\r\nso spoiled\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99d need have somebody to make them feel their duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dears,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou grow\r\nwonderful fast. I doubt they\xe2\x80\x99ll outgrow their strength,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nlooking over their heads, with a melancholy expression, at their\r\nmother. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the gell has too much hair. I\xe2\x80\x99d have it thinned and\r\ncut shorter, sister, if I was you; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for her health. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat as makes her skin so brown, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nso, sister Deane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Deane, shutting her lips\r\nclose again, and looking at Maggie with a critical eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cthe child\xe2\x80\x99s healthy enough; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing ails her. There\xe2\x80\x99s red wheat as well as white, for that matter,\r\nand some like the dark grain best. But it \xe2\x80\x99ud be as well if Bessy \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nhave the child\xe2\x80\x99s hair cut, so as it \xe2\x80\x99ud lie smooth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s breast, but it was\r\narrested by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would\r\nleave Lucy behind. Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see\r\nthem. After various reasons for refusal, Mrs Deane appealed to Lucy\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to stay behind without mother, should you, Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all over\r\nher little neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Lucy! Let her stay, Mrs Deane, let her stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDeane, a large but alert-looking man, with a type of _physique_ to be\r\nseen in all ranks of English society,\xe2\x80\x94bald crown, red whiskers, full\r\nforehead, and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen\r\nlike Mr Deane, and you may see grocers or day-labourers like him; but\r\nthe keenness of his brown eyes was less common than his contour.\r\n\r\nHe held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his hand, and now and then\r\nexchanged a pinch with Mr Tulliver, whose box was only silver-mounted,\r\nso that it was naturally a joke between them that Mr Tulliver wanted to\r\nexchange snuff-boxes also. Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s box had been given him by the\r\nsuperior partners in the firm to which he belonged, at the same time\r\nthat they gave him a share in the business, in acknowledgment of his\r\nvaluable services as manager. No man was thought more highly of in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s than Mr Deane; and some persons were even of opinion that Miss\r\nSusan Dodson, who was once held to have made the worst match of all the\r\nDodson sisters, might one day ride in a better carriage, and live in a\r\nbetter house, even than her sister Pullet. There was no knowing where a\r\nman would stop, who had got his foot into a great mill-owning,\r\nship-owning business like that of Guest & Co., with a banking concern\r\nattached. And Mrs Deane, as her intimate female friends observed, was\r\nproud and \xe2\x80\x9chaving\xe2\x80\x9d enough; _she_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her husband stand still\r\nin the world for want of spurring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her, and whispering in\r\nher ear, as soon as this point of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s staying was settled, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and\r\nget your hair brushed, do, for shame. I told you not to come in without\r\ngoing to Martha first, you know I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom come out with me,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she\r\npassed him; and Tom followed willingly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome upstairs with me, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, when they were outside the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I want to do before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no time to play at anything before dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, whose\r\nimagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, there is time for this; _do_ come, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and saw her go at\r\nonce to a drawer, from which she took out a large pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they for, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, feeling his curiosity awakened.\r\n\r\nMaggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight\r\nacross the middle of her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my buttons! Maggie, you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nnot cut any more off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSnip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking, and he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling it was rather good fun; Maggie would look so\r\nqueer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Tom, cut it behind for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, excited by her own\r\ndaring, and anxious to finish the deed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll catch it, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, nodding his head in an\r\nadmonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he took the scissors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, giving a little stamp with her\r\nfoot. Her cheeks were quite flushed.\r\n\r\nThe black locks were so thick, nothing could be more tempting to a lad\r\nwho had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmane. I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of\r\nscissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair. One delicious\r\ngrinding snip, and then another and another, and the hinder-locks fell\r\nheavily on the floor, and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged, uneven\r\nmanner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom, as if she had\r\nemerged from a wood into the open plain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, jumping round her, and slapping his knees as he\r\nlaughed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my buttons! what a queer thing you look! Look at yourself\r\nin the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at\r\nschool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie felt an unexpected pang. She had thought beforehand chiefly at\r\nher own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it,\r\nand something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and\r\nher aunts by this very decided course of action; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her\r\nhair to look pretty,\xe2\x80\x94that was out of the question,\xe2\x80\x94she only wanted\r\npeople to think her a clever little girl, and not to find fault with\r\nher. But now, when Tom began to laugh at her, and say she was like an\r\nidiot, the affair had quite a new aspect. She looked in the glass, and\r\nstill Tom laughed and clapped his hands, and Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks began to\r\npale, and her lips to tremble a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Maggie, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go down to dinner directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nmy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a passionate tone, with an\r\noutburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him a push.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, spitfire!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you cut it off for, then? I\r\nshall go down: I can smell the dinner going in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the\r\nirrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul.\r\nShe could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, that it was very\r\nfoolish, and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair\r\nthan ever; for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse, and\r\nthen saw not only their consequences, but what would have happened if\r\nthey had not been done, with all the detail and exaggerated\r\ncircumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did the same sort of\r\nfoolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive discernment of\r\nwhat would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it happened,\r\nthat though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his\r\nmother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of\r\nthat sort, he espoused it, and stood by it: he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d If he\r\nbroke the lash of his father\xe2\x80\x99s gigwhip by lashing the gate, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it,\xe2\x80\x94the whip shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got caught in the hinge. If Tom\r\nTulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of\r\ngates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was\r\njustifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be\r\nsorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it\r\nimpossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes\r\nand severe words of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who\r\nwaited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at\r\nher; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and\r\nif she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and\r\nLucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What could she do\r\nbut sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as\r\nAjax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish\r\nseems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills,\r\ndead loves, and broken friendships; but it was not less bitter to\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it was even more bitter\xe2\x80\x94than what we are fond of calling\r\nantithetically the real troubles of mature life. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my child, you\r\nwill have real troubles to fret about by and by,\xe2\x80\x9d is the consolation we\r\nhave almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood, and have\r\nrepeated to other children since we have been grown up. We have all of\r\nus sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny bare legs above our little\r\nsocks, when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place;\r\nbut we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over\r\nit, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago.\r\nEvery one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us\r\nstill, but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the\r\nfirmer texture of our youth and manhood; and so it comes that we can\r\nlook on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the\r\nreality of their pain. Is there any one who can recover the experience\r\nof his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what\r\nhappened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and\r\ntrousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of\r\nwhat he felt then, when it was so long from one Midsummer to another;\r\nwhat he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because\r\nhe would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day\r\nin the holidays, when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to amuse himself, and fell\r\nfrom idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from\r\ndefiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let\r\nhim have a tailed coat that \xe2\x80\x9chalf,\xe2\x80\x9d although every other boy of his age\r\nhad gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early\r\nbitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless\r\nconception of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should\r\nnot pooh-pooh the griefs of our children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Maggie, you\xe2\x80\x99re to come down this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kezia, entering\r\nthe room hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cLawks! what have you been a-doing? I never _see_\r\nsuch a fright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Kezia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you you\xe2\x80\x99re to come down, Miss, this minute; your mother\r\nsays so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kezia, going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to\r\nraise her from the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, Kezia; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, resisting\r\nKezia\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait at dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kezia, going\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, you little silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, peeping into the room ten minutes\r\nafter, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you come and have your dinner? There\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngoodies, and mother says you\xe2\x80\x99re to come. What are you crying for, you\r\nlittle spooney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, it was dreadful! Tom was so hard and unconcerned; if _he_ had been\r\ncrying on the floor, Maggie would have cried too. And there was the\r\ndinner, so nice; and she was _so_ hungry. It was very bitter.\r\n\r\nBut Tom was not altogether hard. He was not inclined to cry, and did\r\nnot feel that Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets; but he\r\nwent and put his head near her, and said in a lower, comforting tone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come, then, Magsie? Shall I bring you a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pudding when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had mine, and a custard and things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-e-es,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more tolerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, going away. But he turned again at the door and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99d better come, you know. There\xe2\x80\x99s the dessert,\xe2\x80\x94nuts, you\r\nknow, and cowslip wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s tears had ceased, and she looked reflective as Tom left her.\r\nHis good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering, and\r\nnuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence.\r\n\r\nSlowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks, and slowly she made\r\nher way downstairs. Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against\r\nthe frame of the dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She\r\nsaw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them, and there were the\r\ncustards on a side-table; it was too much. She slipped in and went\r\ntoward the empty chair. But she had no sooner sat down than she\r\nrepented and wished herself back again.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her, and felt such a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cturn\xe2\x80\x9d that she dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish, with the\r\nmost serious results to the table-cloth. For Kezia had not betrayed the\r\nreason of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to come down, not liking to give her\r\nmistress a shock in the moment of carving, and Mrs Tulliver thought\r\nthere was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness, which\r\nwas inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her\r\nown, and Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks and ears began to burn, while uncle Glegg, a\r\nkind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyday! what little gell\xe2\x80\x99s this? Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her. Is it some\r\nlittle gell you\xe2\x80\x99ve picked up in the road, Kezia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and cut her hair herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver in an\r\nundertone to Mr Deane, laughing with much enjoyment. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know\r\nsuch a little hussy as it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, little miss, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made yourself look very funny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle\r\nPullet, and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which was\r\nfelt to be so lacerating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, for shame!\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Glegg, in her loudest, severest tone of\r\nreproof. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed\r\non bread and water,\xe2\x80\x94not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Glegg, meaning to give a playful turn to this\r\ndenunciation, \xe2\x80\x9cshe must be sent to jail, I think, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll cut the\r\nrest of her hair off there, and make it all even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s more like a gypsy nor ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, in a pitying\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very bad luck, sister, as the gell should be so brown; the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s fair enough. I doubt it\xe2\x80\x99ll stand in her way i\xe2\x80\x99 life to be so\r\nbrown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a naughty child, as\xe2\x80\x99ll break her mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, with the tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nMaggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision. Her\r\nfirst flush came from anger, which gave her a transient power of\r\ndefiance, and Tom thought she was braving it out, supported by the\r\nrecent appearance of the pudding and custard. Under this impression, he\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my! Maggie, I told you you\xe2\x80\x99d catch it.\xe2\x80\x9d He meant to be\r\nfriendly, but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her\r\nignominy. Her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant, her\r\nheart swelled, and getting up from her chair, she ran to her father,\r\nhid her face on his shoulder, and burst out into loud sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my wench,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, soothingly, putting his arm\r\nround her, \xe2\x80\x9cnever mind; you was i\xe2\x80\x99 the right to cut it off if it\r\nplagued you; give over crying; father\xe2\x80\x99ll take your part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDelicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these moments\r\nwhen her father \xe2\x80\x9ctook her part\xe2\x80\x9d; she kept them in her heart, and\r\nthought of them long years after, when every one else said that her\r\nfather had done very ill by his children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, in a\r\nloud \xe2\x80\x9caside,\xe2\x80\x9d to Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be the ruin of her, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake care. _My_ father never brought his children up so, else we should\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 been a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99 family to what we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached\r\nthe point at which insensibility begins. She took no notice of her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s remark, but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the\r\npudding, in mute resignation.\r\n\r\nWith the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie, for the\r\nchildren were told they might have their nuts and wine in the\r\nsummer-house, since the day was so mild; and they scampered out among\r\nthe budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals\r\ngetting from under a burning glass.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver had her special reason for this permission: now the dinner\r\nwas despatched, and every one\xe2\x80\x99s mind disengaged, it was the right\r\nmoment to communicate Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s intention concerning Tom, and it\r\nwould be as well for Tom himself to be absent. The children were used\r\nto hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds, and could\r\nunderstand nothing, however they might stretch their necks and listen;\r\nbut on this occasion Mrs Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion,\r\nbecause she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a\r\nclergyman was a sore point with Tom, who looked at it as very much on a\r\npar with going to school to a constable. Mrs Tulliver had a sighing\r\nsense that her husband would do as he liked, whatever sister Glegg\r\nsaid, or sister Pullet either; but at least they would not be able to\r\nsay, if the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had fallen in with her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, interrupting her husband in his talk with Mr\r\nDeane, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time now to tell the children\xe2\x80\x99s aunts and uncles what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of doing with Tom, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no objections to\r\ntell anybody what I mean to do with him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve settled,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nlooking toward Mr Glegg and Mr Deane,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve settled to send him to a Mr\r\nStelling, a parson, down at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton, there,\xe2\x80\x94an uncommon clever\r\nfellow, I understand, as\xe2\x80\x99ll put him up to most things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company, such as\r\nyou may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an\r\nallusion to their week-day affairs from the pulpit. It was equally\r\nastonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s family arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he could hardly\r\nhave been more thoroughly obfuscated if Mr Tulliver had said that he\r\nwas going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor; for uncle Pullet belonged\r\nto that extinct class of British yeoman who, dressed in good\r\nbroadcloth, paid high rates and taxes, went to church, and ate a\r\nparticularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming that the British\r\nconstitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than\r\nthe solar system and the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nIt is melancholy, but true, that Mr Pullet had the most confused idea\r\nof a bishop as a sort of a baronet, who might or might not be a\r\nclergyman; and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family\r\nand fortune, the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too\r\nremote from Mr Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s experience to be readily conceivable. I know it\r\nis difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle\r\nPullet\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance; but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a\r\ngreat natural faculty under favouring circumstances. And uncle Pullet\r\nhad a great natural faculty for ignorance. He was the first to give\r\nutterance to his astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nan amazed twinkling in his eyes, looking at Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, to\r\nsee if they showed any signs of comprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can\r\nmake out,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mr Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling\r\nworld, laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity. \xe2\x80\x9cJacobs\r\nat th\xe2\x80\x99 academy\xe2\x80\x99s no parson, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done very bad by the boy; and I\r\nmade up my mind, if I send him to school again, it should be to\r\nsomebody different to Jacobs. And this Mr Stelling, by what I can make\r\nout, is the sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man I want. And I mean my boy to go to him at\r\nMidsummer,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his snuff-box\r\nand taking a pinch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver?\r\nThe clergymen have highish notions, in general,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, taking\r\nsnuff vigorously, as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you think the parson\xe2\x80\x99ll teach him to know a good sample o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwheat when he sees it, neighbour Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, who was fond\r\nof his jest, and having retired from business, felt that it was not\r\nonly allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a plan i\xe2\x80\x99 my head about Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver,\r\npausing after that statement and lifting up his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I may be allowed to speak, and it\xe2\x80\x99s seldom as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nGlegg, with a tone of bitter meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know what good\r\nis to come to the boy by bringin\xe2\x80\x99 him up above his fortin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, not looking at Mrs Glegg, but at the male part\r\nof his audience, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind not to bring Tom up to\r\nmy own business. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my thoughts about it all along, and I made up\r\nmy mind by what I saw with Garnett and _his_ son. I mean to put him to\r\nsome business as he can go into without capital, and I want to give him\r\nan eddication as he\xe2\x80\x99ll be even wi\xe2\x80\x99 the lawyers and folks, and put me up\r\nto a notion now an\xe2\x80\x99 then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips, that\r\nsmiled in mingled pity and scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud be a fine deal better for some people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after that\r\nintroductory note, \xe2\x80\x9cif they\xe2\x80\x99d let the lawyers alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as\r\nthat at Market Bewley?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t take more than two\r\nor three pupils, and so he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the more time to attend to \xe2\x80\x99em, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and get his eddication done the sooner; they can\xe2\x80\x99t learn much at a\r\ntime when there\xe2\x80\x99s so many of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet, feeling that he\r\nwas getting quite an insight into this difficult matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll want the more pay, I doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, a cool hundred a year, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, with\r\nsome pride at his own spirited course. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\ninvestment; Tom\xe2\x80\x99s eddication \xe2\x80\x99ull be so much capital to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cWell well, neighbour\r\nTulliver, you may be right, you may be right:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98When land is gone and money\xe2\x80\x99s spent,\r\n     Then learning is most excellent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton. But us\r\nthat have got no learning had better keep our money, eh, neighbour\r\nPullet?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Glegg rubbed his knees, and looked very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg, I wonder _at_ you,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very unbecoming in\r\na man o\xe2\x80\x99 your age and belongings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s unbecoming, Mrs G.?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, winking pleasantly at the\r\ncompany. \xe2\x80\x9cMy new blue coat as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity your weakness, Mr Glegg. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s unbecoming to be making a\r\njoke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean me by that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, considerably nettled, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to fret about me. I can manage my own affairs\r\nwithout troubling other folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, judiciously introducing a new idea, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy,\r\nnow I come to think of it, somebody said Wakem was going to send _his_\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94the deformed lad\xe2\x80\x94to a clergyman, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d (appealing to\r\nhis wife).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give no account of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Deane, closing her\r\nlips very tightly again. Mrs Deane was not a woman to take part in a\r\nscene where missiles were flying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that Mrs\r\nGlegg might see he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind her, \xe2\x80\x9cif Wakem thinks o\xe2\x80\x99 sending his son\r\nto a clergyman, depend on it I shall make no mistake i\xe2\x80\x99 sending Tom to\r\none. Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made, but he knows\r\nthe length of every man\xe2\x80\x99s foot he\xe2\x80\x99s got to deal with. Ay, ay, tell me\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s butcher, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where to get your meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut lawyer Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x99s got a hump-back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, who felt\r\nas if the whole business had a funereal aspect; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s more nat\xe2\x80\x99ral to\r\nsend _him_ to a clergyman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, interpreting Mrs Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s observation with\r\nerroneous plausibility, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must consider that, neighbour Tulliver;\r\nWakem\xe2\x80\x99s son isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to follow any business. Wakem \xe2\x80\x99ull make a\r\ngentleman of him, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs G., in a tone which implied that her indignation\r\nwould fizz and ooze a little, though she was determined to keep it\r\ncorked up, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d far better hold your tongue. Mr Tulliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto know your opinion nor mine either. There\xe2\x80\x99s folks in the world as\r\nknow better than everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I should think that\xe2\x80\x99s you, if we\xe2\x80\x99re to trust your own tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Tulliver, beginning to boil up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ say nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cMy advice has\r\nnever been asked, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first time, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re over-ready at giving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been over-ready at lending, then, if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been over-ready at\r\ngiving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s folks I\xe2\x80\x99ve lent money to, as perhaps\r\nI shall repent o\xe2\x80\x99 lending money to kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, soothingly. But Mr Tulliver was not\r\nto be hindered of his retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bond for it, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ve had your\r\nfive per cent, kin or no kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, pleadingly, \xe2\x80\x9cdrink your wine, and let me\r\ngive you some almonds and raisins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, very much with the feeling\r\nof a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the\r\nman who carries no stick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s poor work talking o\xe2\x80\x99 almonds and\r\nraisins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLors, sister Glegg, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so quarrelsome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet,\r\nbeginning to cry a little. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be struck with a fit, getting so\r\nred in the face after dinner, and we are but just out o\xe2\x80\x99 mourning, all\r\nof us,\xe2\x80\x94and all wi\xe2\x80\x99 gowns craped alike and just put by; it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad\r\namong sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it _is_ bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cThings are come to a\r\nfine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to\r\nquarrel with her and abuse her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly, Jane; be reasonable, be reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg.\r\n\r\nBut while he was speaking, Mr Tulliver, who had by no means said enough\r\nto satisfy his anger, burst out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to quarrel with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you as can\xe2\x80\x99t let people\r\nalone, but must be gnawing at \xe2\x80\x99em forever. _I_ should never want to\r\nquarrel with any woman if she kept her place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy place, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, getting rather more shrill.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your betters, Mr Tulliver, as are dead and in their grave,\r\ntreated me with a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99 respect to what you do; _though_\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a husband as\xe2\x80\x99ll sit by and see me abused by them as \xe2\x80\x99ud never\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 had the chance if there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been them in our family as married\r\nworse than they might ha\xe2\x80\x99 done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cmy family\xe2\x80\x99s as good as yours,\r\nand better, for it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a damned ill-tempered woman in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, rising from her chair, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether\r\nyou think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at, Mr Glegg;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stay a minute longer in this house. You can stay\r\nbehind, and come home with the gig, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart, dear heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg in a melancholy tone, as he\r\nfollowed his wife out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Tulliver, how could you talk so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, with the tears\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, too hot to be damped by any amount of\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her go, and the sooner the better; she won\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to\r\ndomineer over _me_ again in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, helplessly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it \xe2\x80\x99ud be\r\nany use for you to go after her and try to pacify her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not, better not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make it up another\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sisters, shall we go and look at the children?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, drying her eyes.\r\n\r\nNo proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr Tulliver felt very\r\nmuch as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women\r\nwere out of the room. There were few things he liked better than a chat\r\nwith Mr Deane, whose close application to business allowed the pleasure\r\nvery rarely. Mr Deane, he considered, was the \xe2\x80\x9cknowingest\xe2\x80\x9d man of his\r\nacquaintance, and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made\r\nan agreeable supplement to Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s own tendency that way, which\r\nhad remained in rather an inarticulate condition. And now the women\r\nwere gone, they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous\r\ninterruption. They could exchange their views concerning the Duke of\r\nWellington, whose conduct in the Catholic Question had thrown such an\r\nentirely new light on his character; and speak slightingly of his\r\nconduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he would never have won if\r\nthere hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a great many Englishmen at his back, not to speak of\r\nBlucher and the Prussians, who, as Mr Tulliver had heard from a person\r\nof particular knowledge in that matter, had come up in the very nick of\r\ntime; though here there was a slight dissidence, Mr Deane remarking\r\nthat he was not disposed to give much credit to the Prussians,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbuild of their vessels, together with the unsatisfactory character of\r\ntransactions in Dantzic beer, inclining him to form rather a low view\r\nof Prussian pluck generally. Rather beaten on this ground, Mr Tulliver\r\nproceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be\r\nwhat it used to be; but Mr Deane, attached to a firm of which the\r\nreturns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the\r\npresent, and had some details to give concerning the state of the\r\nimports, especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when\r\nthe country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and\r\nthere would be no more chance for honest men.\r\n\r\nUncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high\r\nmatters. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand politics himself,\xe2\x80\x94thought they were a\r\nnatural gift,\xe2\x80\x94but by what he could make out, this Duke of Wellington\r\nwas no better than he should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose sister Glegg should call her money in; it \xe2\x80\x99ud be very awkward\r\nfor you to have to raise five hundred pounds now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver to\r\nher husband that evening, as she took a plaintive review of the day.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband, yet she\r\nretained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of\r\nsaying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she\r\ndesired. Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way,\r\nas a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful\r\nillusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling\r\nglass. Mrs Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind, and after running\r\nher head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go\r\nat it again to-day with undulled alacrity.\r\n\r\nThis observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr Tulliver that\r\nit would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds;\r\nand when Mrs Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he would\r\nraise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he\r\nnever _would_ mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to\r\nlend money without security, Mr Tulliver, getting warm, declared that\r\nMrs Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money, he should\r\npay it in whether or not. He was not going to be beholden to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsisters. When a man had married into a family where there was a whole\r\nlitter of women, he might have plenty to put up with if he chose. But\r\nMr Tulliver did _not_ choose.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she put on her\r\nnightcap; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by the\r\nthought that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet\r\nto-morrow, when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea. Not\r\nthat she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk; but it\r\nseemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain\r\nunmodified when they were complained against.\r\n\r\nHer husband lay awake rather longer, for he too was thinking of a visit\r\nhe would pay on the morrow; and his ideas on the subject were not of so\r\nvague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a\r\npromptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful\r\nsense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which\r\nhis more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really\r\nnot improbable that there was a direct relation between these\r\napparently contradictory phenomena, since I have observed that for\r\ngetting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing\r\nlike snatching hastily at a single thread. It was owing to this\r\npromptitude that Mr Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the\r\nnext day (he was not dyspeptic) on his way to Basset to see his sister\r\nMoss and her husband. For having made up his mind irrevocably that he\r\nwould pay Mrs Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally\r\noccurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds\r\nlent to his brother-in-law Moss; and if the said brother-in-law could\r\nmanage to pay in the money within a given time, it would go far to\r\nlessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s spirited\r\nstep might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know\r\nprecisely _how_ a thing is to be done before they are strongly\r\nconfident that it will be easy.\r\n\r\nFor Mr Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like\r\nother everyday things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be\r\nfelt in the long run: he was held to be a much more substantial man\r\nthan he really was. And as we are all apt to believe what the world\r\nbelieves about us, it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with\r\nthe same sort of remote pity with which a spare, long-necked man hears\r\nthat his plethoric short-necked neighbour is stricken with apoplexy. He\r\nhad been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a\r\nman who worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these\r\njokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable\r\nsubstance. They gave a pleasant flavour to his glass on a market-day,\r\nand if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr\r\nTulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two\r\nthousand pounds on his very desirable freehold. That was not altogether\r\nhis own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has\r\nneighbours that _will_ go to law with him is not likely to pay off his\r\nmortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances\r\nwho want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be\r\nrepresented by parchment. Our friend Mr Tulliver had a good-natured\r\nfibre in him, and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his\r\nsister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way\r\ncharacteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had\r\nquite thrown herself away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by\r\nhaving an eighth baby. On this point Mr Tulliver was conscious of being\r\na little weak; but he apologised to himself by saying that poor Gritty\r\nhad been a good-looking wench before she married Moss; he would\r\nsometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice. But\r\nthis morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business, and in\r\nthe course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with their deep\r\nruts,\xe2\x80\x94lying so far away from a market-town that the labour of drawing\r\nproduce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits\r\non such poor land as that parish was made of,\xe2\x80\x94he got up a due amount of\r\nirritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and\r\nblight were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the\r\nmore you tried to help him out of the mud, would sink the further in.\r\nIt would do him good rather than harm, now, if he were obliged to raise\r\nthis three hundred pounds; it would make him look about him better, and\r\nnot act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last; in\r\nfact, Mr Tulliver had been too easy with his brother-in-law, and\r\nbecause he had let the interest run on for two years, Moss was likely\r\nenough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal.\r\nBut Mr Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people\r\nany longer; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to\r\nenervate a man\xe2\x80\x99s resolution by softening his temper. The deep-trodden\r\nhoof-marks, made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now\r\nand then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of\r\nlawyers, who, whether by means of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless\r\nsomething to do with this state of the roads; and the abundance of foul\r\nland and neglected fences that met his eye, though they made no part of\r\nhis brother Moss\xe2\x80\x99s farm, strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction\r\nwith that unlucky agriculturist. If this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Moss\xe2\x80\x99s fallow, it might\r\nhave been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and his opinion was certainly not groundless.\r\nBasset had a poor soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a\r\npoor non-resident vicar, and rather less than half a curate, also poor.\r\nIf any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to\r\ntriumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset\r\nmight nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I have\r\nnothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know that, in\r\npoint of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its\r\ncircumstances. The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the\r\nunaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other, did really lead,\r\nwith patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet in\r\nBasset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation,\r\nspoken of formerly as the \xe2\x80\x9cMarkis o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby,\xe2\x80\x9d but among intimates as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDickison\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d A large low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of\r\ntobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr Dickison leaning against\r\nthe door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to\r\nthe daylight as a last night\xe2\x80\x99s guttered candle,\xe2\x80\x94all this may not seem a\r\nvery seductive form of temptation; but the majority of men in Basset\r\nfound it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any wife in Basset wished to\r\nindicate that her husband was not a pleasure-seeking man, she could\r\nhardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a\r\nshilling at Dickison\xe2\x80\x99s from one Whitsuntide to another. Mrs Moss had\r\nsaid so of _her_ husband more than once, when her brother was in a mood\r\nto find fault with him, as he certainly was to-day. And nothing could\r\nbe less pacifying to Mr Tulliver than the behaviour of the farmyard\r\ngate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick\r\nthan it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the\r\nperil of shins, whether equine or human. He was about to get down and\r\nlead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed\r\ndrearily by the large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of\r\ntumble-down dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the\r\ntimely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he\r\nhad determined on,\xe2\x80\x94namely, not to get down from his horse during this\r\nvisit. If a man means to be hard, let him keep in his saddle and speak\r\nfrom that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the\r\ncommand of a distant horizon. Mrs Moss heard the sound of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the kitchen\r\ndoor, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her\r\narms. Mrs Moss\xe2\x80\x99s face bore a faded resemblance to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s; baby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle fat hand, pressed against her cheek, seemed to show more\r\nstrikingly that the cheek was faded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an affectionate tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t look for you to-day. How do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pretty well, Mrs Moss, pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the brother, with\r\ncool deliberation, as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that\r\nquestion. She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humour;\r\nhe never called her Mrs Moss except when he was angry, and when they\r\nwere in company. But she thought it was in the order of nature that\r\npeople who were poorly off should be snubbed. Mrs Moss did not take her\r\nstand on the equality of the human race; she was a patient, prolific,\r\nloving-hearted woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the house, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Tulliver after a\r\ngrave pause, during which four children had run out, like chickens\r\nwhose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s only in the potato-field yonders.\r\nGeorgy, run to the Far Close in a minute, and tell father your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get down, brother, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, and take something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I can\xe2\x80\x99t get down. I must be going home again directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Tulliver, looking at the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Tulliver and the children?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, humbly, not\r\ndaring to press her invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pretty well. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s going to a new school at Midsummer,\xe2\x80\x94a deal of\r\nexpense to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s bad work for me, lying out o\xe2\x80\x99 my money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d be so good as let the children come and see their cousins\r\nsome day. My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never\r\nwas. And me her godmother, and so fond of her; there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody \xe2\x80\x99ud make\r\na bigger fuss with her, according to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got. And I know she\r\nlikes to come, for she\xe2\x80\x99s a loving child, and how quick and clever she\r\nis, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mrs Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world, instead\r\nof being one of the simplest, she could have thought of nothing more\r\nlikely to propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie. He seldom\r\nfound any one volunteering praise of \xe2\x80\x9cthe little wench\xe2\x80\x9d; it was usually\r\nleft entirely to himself to insist on her merits. But Maggie always\r\nappeared in the most amiable light at her aunt Moss\xe2\x80\x99s; it was her\r\nAlsatia, where she was out of the reach of law,\xe2\x80\x94if she upset anything,\r\ndirtied her shoes, or tore her frock, these things were matters of\r\ncourse at her aunt Moss\xe2\x80\x99s. In spite of himself, Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes got\r\nmilder, and he did not look away from his sister as he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; she\xe2\x80\x99s fonder o\xe2\x80\x99 you than o\xe2\x80\x99 the other aunts, I think. She takes\r\nafter our family: not a bit of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoss says she\xe2\x80\x99s just like what I used to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I\r\nwas never so quick and fond o\xe2\x80\x99 the books. But I think my Lizzy\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nher; _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my dear, and let your uncle see\r\nyou; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her mother\r\ndrew her forward, for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle\r\nfrom Dorlcote Mill. She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and\r\nstrength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely\r\nflattering to Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s fatherly love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, they\xe2\x80\x99re a bit alike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking kindly at the little figure\r\nin the soiled pinafore. \xe2\x80\x9cThey both take after our mother. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nenough o\xe2\x80\x99 gells, Gritty,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a tone half compassionate, half\r\nreproachful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour of \xe2\x80\x99em, bless \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, with a sigh, stroking Lizzy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair on each side of her forehead; \xe2\x80\x9cas many as there\xe2\x80\x99s boys. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a brother apiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but they must turn out and fend for themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver,\r\nfeeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by\r\nthrowing out a wholesome hint \xe2\x80\x9cThey mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look to hanging on their\r\nbrothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I hope their brothers \xe2\x80\x99ull love the poor things, and remember\r\nthey came o\xe2\x80\x99 one father and mother; the lads \xe2\x80\x99ull never be the poorer\r\nfor that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity, like a\r\nhalf-smothered fire.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked\r\nit, and said angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cStand still with you!\xe2\x80\x9d much to the astonishment\r\nof that innocent animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the more there is of \xe2\x80\x99em, the more they must love one another,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs Moss went on, looking at her children with a didactic purpose. But\r\nshe turned toward her brother again to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNot but what I hope your\r\nboy \xe2\x80\x99ull allays be good to his sister, though there\xe2\x80\x99s but two of \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nlike you and me, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe arrow went straight to Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He had not a rapid\r\nimagination, but the thought of Maggie was very near to him, and he was\r\nnot long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s relation to Maggie. Would the little wench ever be poorly off,\r\nand Tom rather hard upon her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Gritty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the miller, with a new softness in his tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays done what I could for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as if\r\nvindicating himself from a reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not denying that, brother, and I\xe2\x80\x99m noways ungrateful,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor\r\nMrs Moss, too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for any\r\npride. \xe2\x80\x9cBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the father. What a while you\xe2\x80\x99ve been, Moss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile, do you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Moss, feeling out of breath and\r\ninjured. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been running all the way. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you \xe2\x80\x99light, Mr\r\nTulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just get down and have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 talk with you in the\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, thinking that he should be more likely to\r\nshow a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present.\r\n\r\nHe got down, and passed with Mr Moss into the garden, toward an old\r\nyew-tree arbour, while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back\r\nand looking wistfully after them.\r\n\r\nTheir entrance into the yew-tree arbour surprised several fowls that\r\nwere recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty\r\nground, and at once took flight with much pother and cackling. Mr\r\nTulliver sat down on the bench, and tapping the ground curiously here\r\nand there with his stick, as if he suspected some hollowness, opened\r\nthe conversation by observing, with something like a snarl in his\r\ntone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got wheat again in that Corner Close, I see; and never a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 dressing on it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do no good with it this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Moss, who, when he married Miss Tulliver, had been regarded as the\r\nbuck of Basset, now wore a beard nearly a week old, and had the\r\ndepressed, unexpectant air of a machine-horse. He answered in a\r\npatient-grumbling tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, poor farmers like me must do as they can;\r\nthey must leave it to them as have got money to play with, to put half\r\nas much into the ground as they mean to get out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who should have money to play with, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t them as\r\ncan borrow money without paying interest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, who wished\r\nto get into a slight quarrel; it was the most natural and easy\r\nintroduction to calling in money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m behind with the interest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Moss, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was so\r\nunlucky wi\xe2\x80\x99 the wool last year; and what with the Missis being laid up\r\nso, things have gone awk\xe2\x80\x99arder nor usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s folks as things \xe2\x80\x99ull allays go\r\nawk\xe2\x80\x99ard with; empty sacks \xe2\x80\x99ull never stand upright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what fault you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, Mr Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Moss, deprecatingly; \xe2\x80\x9cI know there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a day-labourer works\r\nharder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a man\r\nmarries, and\xe2\x80\x99s got no capital to work his farm but his wife\xe2\x80\x99s bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfortin? I was against it from the first; but you\xe2\x80\x99d neither of you\r\nlisten to me. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t lie out o\xe2\x80\x99 my money any longer, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto pay five hundred o\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s, and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be Tom an expense to\r\nme. I should find myself short, even saying I\xe2\x80\x99d got back all as is my\r\nown. You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred\r\npound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Moss, looking blankly before\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99d better be sold up, and ha\xe2\x80\x99 done with it; I must part wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nevery head o\xe2\x80\x99 stock I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, to pay you and the landlord too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor relations are undeniably irritating,\xe2\x80\x94their existence is so\r\nentirely uncalled for on our part, and they are almost always very\r\nfaulty people. Mr Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much\r\nirritated with Mr Moss as he had desired, and he was able to say\r\nangrily, rising from his seat,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must do as you can. _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t find money for everybody else\r\nas well as myself. I must look to my own business and my own family. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t lie out o\xe2\x80\x99 my money any longer. You must raise it as quick as you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbour as he uttered the last\r\nsentence, and, without looking round at Mr Moss, went on to the kitchen\r\ndoor, where the eldest boy was holding his horse, and his sister was\r\nwaiting in a state of wondering alarm, which was not without its\r\nalleviations, for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds, and\r\nperforming a great deal of finger practice on the faded face. Mrs Moss\r\nhad eight children, but could never overcome her regret that the twins\r\nhad not lived. Mr Moss thought their removal was not without its\r\nconsolations. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking anxiously\r\nat her husband, who was walking slowly up, while Mr Tulliver had his\r\nfoot already in the stirrup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning his horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, and riding away.\r\n\r\nNo man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate, and\r\na little way along the deep-rutted lane; but before he reached the next\r\nturning, which would take him out of sight of the dilapidated\r\nfarm-buildings, he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought. He\r\nchecked his horse, and made it stand still in the same spot for two or\r\nthree minutes, during which he turned his head from side to side in a\r\nmelancholy way, as if he were looking at some painful object on more\r\nsides than one. Evidently, after his fit of promptitude, Mr Tulliver\r\nwas relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world. He turned\r\nhis horse, and rode slowly back, giving vent to the climax of feeling\r\nwhich had determined this movement by saying aloud, as he struck his\r\nhorse, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little wench! she\xe2\x80\x99ll have nobody but Tom, belike, when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s return into the yard was descried by several young\r\nMosses, who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother,\r\nso that Mrs Moss was again on the door-step when her brother rode up.\r\nShe had been crying, but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now, and\r\nmade no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her, but\r\nmerely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the field, again, if you want him, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Gritty, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, in a gentle tone. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfret,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a shift without the money a bit, only you\r\nmust be as clever and contriving as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Moss\xe2\x80\x99s tears came again at this unexpected kindness, and she could\r\nsay nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x94the little wench shall come and see you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her\r\nand Tom some day before he goes to school. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t fret. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nallays be a good brother to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for that word, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, drying her tears;\r\nthen turning to Lizzy, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cRun now, and fetch the coloured egg\r\nfor cousin Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzy ran in, and quickly reappeared with a small\r\npaper parcel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s boiled hard, brother, and coloured with thrums, very pretty; it\r\nwas done o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for Maggie. Will you please to carry it in your\r\npocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, putting it carefully in his side pocket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather\r\nmore puzzled than before as to ways and means, but still with the sense\r\nof a danger escaped. It had come across his mind that if he were hard\r\nupon his sister, it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie at\r\nsome distant day, when her father was no longer there to take her part;\r\nfor simple people, like our friend Mr Tulliver, are apt to clothe\r\nunimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas, and this was his confused\r\nway of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for \xe2\x80\x9cthe little\r\nwench\xe2\x80\x9d had given him a new sensibility toward his sister.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nTo Garum Firs\r\n\r\nWhile the possible troubles of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s future were occupying her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mind, she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the\r\npresent. Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no\r\nmemories of outlived sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie. The pleasure of having\r\nLucy to look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs,\r\nwhere she would hear uncle Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s musical box, had been marred as\r\nearly as eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which\r\nhe had found her hair, holding up one jagged lock after another and\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cSee here! tut, tut, tut!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of mingled disgust and\r\npity, which to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s imagination was equivalent to the strongest\r\nexpression of public opinion. Mr Rappit, the hair-dresser, with his\r\nwell-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward, like the simulated\r\npyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her at that moment the\r\nmost formidable of her contemporaries, into whose street at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshe would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in\r\nthe Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best\r\nclothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes\r\nthe case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never\r\nrolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and\r\nwhere the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily\r\nproduced no shock to the mind. Already, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mrs Tulliver\r\nhad on her visiting costume, with a protective apparatus of brown\r\nholland, as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of\r\nflies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders, that she might\r\nif possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while her\r\nmother was remonstrating, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Maggie, my dear; don\xe2\x80\x99t make yourself\r\nso ugly!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a\r\nrelief to his best blue suit, which he wore with becoming calmness,\r\nhaving, after a little wrangling, effected what was always the one\r\npoint of interest to him in his toilet: he had transferred all the\r\ncontents of his everyday pockets to those actually in wear.\r\n\r\nAs for Lucy, she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday;\r\nno accidents ever happened to her clothes, and she was never\r\nuncomfortable in them, so that she looked with wondering pity at\r\nMaggie, pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker. Maggie\r\nwould certainly have torn it off, if she had not been checked by the\r\nremembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair; as it was, she\r\nconfined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving peevishly about\r\nthe card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner, as a\r\nsuitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes. Tom could\r\nbuild perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s would never bear the\r\nlaying on the roof. It was always so with the things that Maggie made;\r\nand Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make\r\nanything. But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at\r\nbuilding; she handled the cards so lightly, and moved so gently, that\r\nTom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own, the more\r\nreadily because she had asked him to teach her. Maggie, too, would have\r\nadmired Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s houses, and would have given up her own unsuccessful\r\nbuilding to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her tucker had not\r\nmade her peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her\r\nhouses fell, and told her she was \xe2\x80\x9ca stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a stupid. I\r\nknow a great many things you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I dare say, Miss Spitfire! I\xe2\x80\x99d never be such a cross thing as you,\r\nmaking faces like that. Lucy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do so. I like Lucy better than\r\nyou; _I_ wish Lucy was _my_ sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nstarting up hurriedly from her place on the floor, and upsetting Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful pagoda. She really did not mean it, but the circumstantial\r\nevidence was against her, and Tom turned white with anger, but said\r\nnothing; he would have struck her, only he knew it was cowardly to\r\nstrike a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do\r\nanything cowardly.\r\n\r\nMaggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and\r\nwalked away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his pagoda, and Lucy\r\nlooked on mutely, like a kitten pausing from its lapping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom took no notice of her, but took, instead, two or three hard peas\r\nout of his pocket, and shot them with his thumbnail against the window,\r\nvaguely at first, but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a\r\nsuperannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the\r\nspring sunshine, clearly against the views of Nature, who had provided\r\nTom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual.\r\n\r\nThus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s persistent\r\ncoldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and\r\nsunshine for her. He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest\r\nwithout caring to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy\r\nand himself, without offering one to Maggie. Lucy had said, \xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ like one?\xe2\x80\x9d but Tom was deaf.\r\n\r\nStill, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the\r\nstackyard wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert\r\nthe mind temporarily from personal grievances. And this was only the\r\nbeginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs. All the farmyard life was\r\nwonderful there,\xe2\x80\x94bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens,\r\nwith their feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew\r\nand screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons\r\nand a tame magpie; nay, a goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half\r\nmastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a lion. Then there were white\r\nrailings and white gates all about, and glittering weathercocks of\r\nvarious design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful\r\npatterns,\xe2\x80\x94nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom thought that\r\nthe unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general\r\nunusualness which characterised uncle Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s possessions as a\r\ngentleman farmer. Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner. As for the\r\nhouse, it was not less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and two\r\nwings with battlemented turrets, and was covered with glittering white\r\nstucco.\r\n\r\nUncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window,\r\nand made haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in this\r\nfortified condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to know\r\nof the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate\r\nrushing in and carrying it away on their heads. Aunt Pullet, too,\r\nappeared at the doorway, and as soon as her sister was within hearing\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cStop the children, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Bessy; don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x99em come up\r\nthe door-steps; Sally\xe2\x80\x99s bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub\r\ntheir shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes\r\non; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled\r\nparticularly against this shoewiping, which he always considered in the\r\nlight of an indignity to his sex. He felt it as the beginning of the\r\ndisagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s, where he had once\r\nbeen compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which\r\nmay serve to correct the too hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum\r\nFirs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of\r\nanimals,\xe2\x80\x94fond, that is, of throwing stones at them.\r\n\r\nThe next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was\r\nthe mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome\r\ncarpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of\r\nthese glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by\r\nordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off\r\nwith unbroken limbs. Sophy\xe2\x80\x99s weakness about these polished stairs was\r\nalways a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s part; but Mrs\r\nTulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking to herself it was a\r\nmercy when she and the children were safe on the landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, in a\r\npathetic tone, as Mrs Tulliver adjusted her cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, with an air of much interest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s apt to make a mess with clothes, taking \xe2\x80\x99em out and putting \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nin again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and\r\nlooking at them earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a pity for you to go away\r\nwithout seeing it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what may happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration,\r\nwhich determined her to single out a particular key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99ll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I _should_ like to see what sort of a crown she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmade you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very\r\nbright wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she would find a\r\nnew bonnet. Not at all. Such a supposition could only have arisen from\r\na too superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family. In\r\nthis wardrobe Mrs Pullet was seeking something small enough to be\r\nhidden among layers of linen,\xe2\x80\x94it was a door-key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come with me into the best room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the children come too, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Tulliver, who saw\r\nthat Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps be safer for \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nto come; they\xe2\x80\x99ll be touching something if we leave \xe2\x80\x99em behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor,\r\ndimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the\r\nclosed shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet paused and\r\nunlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the\r\npassage,\xe2\x80\x94a darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly,\r\nshowed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds.\r\nEverything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward. Lucy laid\r\nhold of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s frock, and Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat rapidly.\r\n\r\nAunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe,\r\nwith a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the\r\nfunereal solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of rose-leaves\r\nthat issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet\r\nafter sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the\r\nsight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie, who would have\r\npreferred something more strikingly preternatural. But few things could\r\nhave been more impressive to Mrs Tulliver. She looked all round it in\r\nsilence for some moments, and then said emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sister,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never speak against the full crowns again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a great concession, and Mrs Pullet felt it; she felt something\r\nwas due to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it on, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll open the\r\nshutter a bit further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind taking off your cap, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver.\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a\r\njutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and\r\njudicious women of those times, and placing the bonnet on her head,\r\nturned slowly round, like a draper\xe2\x80\x99s lay-figure, that Mrs Tulliver\r\nmight miss no point of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes thought there\xe2\x80\x99s a loop too much o\xe2\x80\x99 ribbon on this left\r\nside, sister; what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her\r\nhead on one side. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s best as it is; if you meddled\r\nwith it, sister, you might repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at\r\nit contemplatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting\r\na humble imitation of this _chef-d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvre_ made from a piece of silk she\r\nhad at home.\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head, and then whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPullet pays for it; he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum\r\nChurch, let the next best be whose it would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning\r\nit to its place in the wardrobe, and her thoughts seemed to have taken\r\na melancholy turn, for she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI may never wear it twice, sister; who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk o\xe2\x80\x99 that sister,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nyour health this summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after\r\nI had my green satin bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 wearing crape less nor half a year for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _would_ be unlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, entering thoroughly into\r\nthe possibility of an inopportune decease. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never so much\r\npleasure i\xe2\x80\x99 wearing a bonnet the second year, especially when the\r\ncrowns are so chancy,\xe2\x80\x94never two summers alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the way i\xe2\x80\x99 this world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, returning the bonnet\r\nto the wardrobe and locking it up. She maintained a silence\r\ncharacterised by head-shaking, until they had all issued from the\r\nsolemn chamber and were in her own room again. Then, beginning to cry,\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cSister, if you should never see that bonnet again till I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndead and gone, you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember I showed it you this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected, but she was a woman of\r\nsparse tears, stout and healthy; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cry so much as her sister\r\nPullet did, and had often felt her deficiency at funerals. Her effort\r\nto bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face.\r\nMaggie, looking on attentively, felt that there was some painful\r\nmystery about her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet which she was considered too young to\r\nunderstand; indignantly conscious, all the while, that she could have\r\nunderstood that, as well as everything else, if she had been taken into\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWhen they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he\r\nreckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet,\xe2\x80\x94that was what had made\r\nthem so long upstairs. With Tom the interval had seemed still longer,\r\nfor he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa\r\ndirectly opposite his uncle Pullet, who regarded him with twinkling\r\ngray eyes, and occasionally addressed him as \xe2\x80\x9cYoung sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young sir, what do you learn at school?\xe2\x80\x9d was a standing question\r\nwith uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, rubbed his\r\nhands across his face, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d It was altogether\r\nso embarrassing to be seated _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with uncle Pullet, that Tom\r\ncould not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or the\r\nwonderful flower-pots; he saw nothing but his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s gaiters. Not that\r\nTom was in awe of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mental superiority; indeed, he had made\r\nup his mind that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a gentleman farmer, because he\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle\r\nPullet,\xe2\x80\x94a molly-coddle, in fact. A boy\xe2\x80\x99s sheepishness is by no means a\r\nsign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making encouraging\r\nadvances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of\r\nyour age and wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The\r\nonly consolation I can suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably\r\nthought the same of Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a\r\nrestive horse, or thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand,\r\nthat these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable\r\ncharacter. At least, I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments on\r\nthese points. In very tender years, when he still wore a lace border\r\nunder his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars\r\nof a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while\r\nhe scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike\r\nterror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire\r\nfor mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including\r\ncockchafers, neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has\r\nbeen an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race. Now,\r\nMr Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the least\r\npredatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of\r\nthemselves by nobody\xe2\x80\x99s particular desire. So that Tom was not without\r\nstrong reasons when, in confidential talk with a chum, he had described\r\nuncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe\r\nthat he was a very \xe2\x80\x9crich fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only alleviating circumstance in a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with uncle Pullet\r\nwas that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his\r\nperson, and when at a loss for conversation, he filled up the void by\r\nproposing a mutual solace of this kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like peppermints, young sir?\xe2\x80\x9d required only a tacit answer when\r\nit was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the\r\nfurther solace of small sweet-cakes, of which he also kept a stock\r\nunder lock and key for his own private eating on wet days; but the\r\nthree children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their\r\nfingers, than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till\r\nthe tray and the plates came, since with those crisp cakes they would\r\nmake the floor \xe2\x80\x9call over\xe2\x80\x9d crumbs. Lucy didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that much, for the\r\ncake was so pretty, she thought it was rather a pity to eat it; but\r\nTom, watching his opportunity while the elders were talking, hastily\r\nstowed it in his mouth at two bites, and chewed it furtively. As for\r\nMaggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses and\r\nNausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a \xe2\x80\x9cpretty Scripture thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe presently let fall her cake, and in an unlucky movement crushed it\r\nbeneath her foot,\xe2\x80\x94a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and\r\nconscious disgrace to Maggie, that she began to despair of hearing the\r\nmusical snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to\r\nher that Lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a\r\ntune. So she whispered to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did what she was\r\ndesired to do, went up quietly to her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and blushing all\r\nover her neck while she fingered her necklace, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you please\r\nplay us a tune, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle\r\nPullet that the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the\r\nthing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbours in\r\nGarum. Mr Pullet had _bought_ the box, to begin with, and he understood\r\nwinding it up, and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand;\r\naltogether the possession of this unique \xe2\x80\x9cpiece of music\xe2\x80\x9d was a proof\r\nthat Mr Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s character was not of that entire nullity which might\r\notherwise have been attributed to it. But uncle Pullet, when entreated\r\nto exhibit his accomplishment, never depreciated it by a too ready\r\nconsent. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer he always gave, carefully\r\nabstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of\r\nminutes had passed. Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social\r\noccasions, and in this way fenced himself in from much painful\r\nconfusion and perplexing freedom of will.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment when the fairy\r\ntune began; for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on\r\nher mind, that Tom was angry with her; and by the time \xe2\x80\x9cHush, ye pretty\r\nwarbling choir,\xe2\x80\x9d had been played, her face wore that bright look of\r\nhappiness, while she sat immovable with her hands clasped, which\r\nsometimes comforted her mother with the sense that Maggie could look\r\npretty now and then, in spite of her brown skin. But when the magic\r\nmusic ceased, she jumped up, and running toward Tom, put her arm round\r\nhis neck and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that\r\nhe felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him,\r\ninexplicable caress, I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip\r\nwine in his hand, and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half\r\nof it. He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nthere, now!\xe2\x80\x9d especially when his resentment was sanctioned, as it was,\r\nby general disapprobation of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you sit still, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d her mother said peevishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle gells mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see me if they behave in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\naunt Pullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re too rough, little miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet.\r\n\r\nPoor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her soul,\r\nand the seven small demons all in again.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children\r\nremained indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now\r\nthey were rested after their walk, they might go and play out of doors;\r\nand aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go off the\r\npaved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the poultry fed,\r\nto view them from a distance on the horse-block; a restriction which\r\nhad been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after\r\nthe peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its\r\nfeathers drop off.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel\r\nwith Mrs Glegg by millinery and maternal cares, but now the great theme\r\nof the bonnet was thrown into perspective, and the children were out of\r\nthe way, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties recurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt weighs on my mind so as never was,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, by way of opening the\r\nsubject, \xe2\x80\x9csister Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the house in that way. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nwish t\xe2\x80\x99 offend a sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for what Jane \xe2\x80\x99ull do. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it out o\xe2\x80\x99 the family, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to Dr Turnbull;\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief Jane lives too low. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said so to Pullet often and\r\noften, and he knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from\r\ndrinking tea with \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Pullet, beginning to nurse his knee and\r\nshelter it with his pocket handkerchief, as was his way when the\r\nconversation took an interesting turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery like I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you remember when I said\r\nthings, better than I can remember myself. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a wonderful memory,\r\nPullet has,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, looking pathetically at her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould be poorly off if he was to have a stroke, for he always\r\nremembers when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take my doctor\xe2\x80\x99s stuff; and I\xe2\x80\x99m taking three\r\nsorts now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x98pills as before\xe2\x80\x99 every other night, and the new drops at\r\neleven and four, and the \xe2\x80\x99fervescing mixture \xe2\x80\x98when agreeable,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrehearsed Mr Pullet, with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, perhaps it \xe2\x80\x99ud be better for sister Glegg if _she\xe2\x80\x99d_ go to the\r\ndoctor sometimes, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything the matter with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, who naturally saw the\r\nwide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs Glegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think on,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, raising her hands and\r\nletting them fall again, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople playing with their own insides in that\r\nway! And it\xe2\x80\x99s flying i\xe2\x80\x99 the face o\xe2\x80\x99 Providence; for what are the\r\ndoctors for, if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t to call \xe2\x80\x99em in? And when folks have got the\r\nmoney to pay for a doctor, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t respectable, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Jane many\r\na time. I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of acquaintance knowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _we\xe2\x80\x99ve_ no call to be ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Doctor\r\nTurnbull hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got such another patient as you i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish, now old\r\nMrs Sutton\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nPullet. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t have one sold. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but right folks\r\nshould see \xe2\x80\x99em when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone. They fill two o\xe2\x80\x99 the long store-room\r\nshelves a\xe2\x80\x99ready; but,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, beginning to cry a little, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s well\r\nif they ever fill three. I may go before I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up the dozen o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthese last sizes. The pill-boxes are in the closet in my room,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nremember that, sister,\xe2\x80\x94but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to show for the boluses, if\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t the bills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk o\xe2\x80\x99 your going, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cI should have\r\nnobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was gone. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody but you can get her to make it up with Mr Tulliver, for\r\nsister Deane\xe2\x80\x99s never o\xe2\x80\x99 my side, and if she was, it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be looked\r\nfor as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your husband _is_ awk\xe2\x80\x99ard, you know, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet,\r\ngood-naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sister\xe2\x80\x99s account\r\nas well as her own. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s never behaved quite so pretty to our family\r\nas he should do, and the children take after him,\xe2\x80\x94the boy\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nmischievous, and runs away from his aunts and uncles, and the gell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrude and brown. It\xe2\x80\x99s your bad luck, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you, Bessy; for\r\nyou was allays my favourite sister, and we allays liked the same\r\npatterns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s hasty, and says odd things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver,\r\nwiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s never been the man, since he married me, to object to my making\r\nthe friends o\xe2\x80\x99 my side o\xe2\x80\x99 the family welcome to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make the worst of you, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet,\r\ncompassionately, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I doubt you\xe2\x80\x99ll have trouble enough without that;\r\nand your husband\xe2\x80\x99s got that poor sister and her children hanging on\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you poorly\r\noff when he dies. Not as I\xe2\x80\x99d have it said out o\xe2\x80\x99 the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs\r\nTulliver. Her imagination was not easily acted on, but she could not\r\nhelp thinking that her case was a hard one, since it appeared that\r\nother people thought it hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sister, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, urged by the fear\r\nlest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive, to take\r\ncomprehensive review of her past conduct. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no woman strives\r\nmore for her children; and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells\r\nput together; and there\xe2\x80\x99s the last elder-flower wine I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade\xe2\x80\x94beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though sister\r\nGlegg will have it I\xe2\x80\x99m so extravagant; and as for liking to have my\r\nclothes tidy, and not go a fright about the house, there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody in\r\nthe parish can say anything against me in respect o\xe2\x80\x99 backbiting and\r\nmaking mischief, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish anybody any harm; and nobody loses by\r\nsending me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with the best o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nneighbours\xe2\x80\x99; and the linen\xe2\x80\x99s so in order as if I was to die to-morrow I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed. A woman can do no more nor she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s all o\xe2\x80\x99 no use, you know, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, holding her\r\nhead on one side, and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyour husband makes away with his money. Not but what if you was sold\r\nup, and other folks bought your furniture, it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to think as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve kept it well rubbed. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the linen, with your maiden\r\nmark on, might go all over the country. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a sad pity for our\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\nman to be dictated to,\xe2\x80\x94not if I was to go to the parson and get by\r\nheart what I should tell my husband for the best. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend to know anything about putting out money and all that. I could\r\nnever see into men\xe2\x80\x99s business as sister Glegg does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re like me in that, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be a deal more becoming o\xe2\x80\x99 Jane if she\xe2\x80\x99d have that pier-glass\r\nrubbed oftener,\xe2\x80\x94there was ever so many spots on it last week,\xe2\x80\x94instead\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had, and\r\ntelling \xe2\x80\x99em what they\xe2\x80\x99re to do with their money. But Jane and me were\r\nallays contrairy; she _would_ have striped things, and I like spots.\r\nYou like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung together i\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sophy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember our having a blue ground\r\nwith a white spot both alike,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bit in a bed-quilt now; and if\r\nyou would but go and see sister Glegg, and persuade her to make it up\r\nwith Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays a good\r\nsister to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the right thing \xe2\x80\x99ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her\r\nhimself, and say he was sorry for speaking so rash. If he\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed\r\nmoney of her, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be above that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, whose\r\npartiality did not blind her to principles; she did not forget what was\r\ndue to people of independent fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use talking o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs Tulliver, almost\r\npeevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to\r\nTulliver, he\xe2\x80\x99d never humble himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to persuade _Jane_ to beg pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nPullet. \xe2\x80\x9cHer temper\xe2\x80\x99s beyond everything; it\xe2\x80\x99s well if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t carry\r\nher off her mind, though there never _was_ any of our family went to a\r\nmadhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of her begging pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d just take no notice, and not call her money in; as it\xe2\x80\x99s not so\r\nmuch for one sister to ask of another; time \xe2\x80\x99ud mend things, and\r\nTulliver \xe2\x80\x99ud forget all about it, and they\xe2\x80\x99d be friends again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s irrevocable\r\ndetermination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least such a\r\ndetermination exceeded her powers of belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to help you\r\non to ruin. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be behindhand i\xe2\x80\x99 doing you a good turn, if it is to\r\nbe done. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it said among acquaintance as we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nquarrels in the family. I shall tell Jane that; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\ndriving to Jane\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow, if Pullet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. What do you say, Mr\r\nPullet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no objections,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Pullet, who was perfectly contented with\r\nany course the quarrel might take, so that Mr Tulliver did not apply to\r\n_him_ for money. Mr Pullet was nervous about his investments, and did\r\nnot see how a man could have any security for his money unless he\r\nturned it into land.\r\n\r\nAfter a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better\r\nfor Mrs Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg, Mrs\r\nPullet, observing that it was tea-time, turned to reach from a drawer a\r\ndelicate damask napkin, which she pinned before her in the fashion of\r\nan apron. The door did, in fact, soon open, but instead of the\r\ntea-tray, Sally introduced an object so startling that both Mrs Pullet\r\nand Mrs Tulliver gave a scream, causing uncle Pullet to swallow his\r\nlozenge\xe2\x80\x94for the fifth time in his life, as he afterward noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nMaggie Behaves Worse Than She Expected\r\n\r\nThe startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no\r\nother than little Lucy, with one side of her person, from her small\r\nfoot to her bonnet-crown, wet and discoloured with mud, holding out two\r\ntiny blackened hands, and making a very piteous face. To account for\r\nthis unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s parlour, we must return\r\nto the moment when the three children went to play out of doors, and\r\nthe small demons who had taken possession of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s soul at an early\r\nperiod of the day had returned in all the greater force after a\r\ntemporary absence. All the disagreeable recollections of the morning\r\nwere thick upon her, when Tom, whose displeasure toward her had been\r\nconsiderably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his\r\ncowslip wine, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Lucy, you come along with me,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked\r\noff to the area where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in\r\nexistence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance, looking like a\r\nsmall Medusa with her snakes cropped. Lucy was naturally pleased that\r\ncousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him\r\ntickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down\r\nthe area, with an iron grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to\r\nenjoy the spectacle also, especially as she would doubtless find a name\r\nfor the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy had a\r\ndelighted semi-belief in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s stories about the live things they\r\ncame upon by accident,\xe2\x80\x94how Mrs Earwig had a wash at home, and one of\r\nher children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was\r\nrunning so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had a profound contempt for\r\nthis nonsense of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous\r\nyet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but\r\nLucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something\r\nin it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. So\r\nnow the desire to know the history of a very portly toad, added to her\r\nhabitual affectionateness, made her run back to Maggie and say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nthere is such a big, funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deeper frown. As\r\nlong as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her, Lucy made part of his\r\nunkindness. Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could\r\nnever be cross with pretty little Lucy, any more than she could be\r\ncruel to a little white mouse; but then, Tom had always been quite\r\nindifferent to Lucy before, and it had been left to Maggie to pet and\r\nmake much of her. As it was, she was actually beginning to think that\r\nshe should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her,\r\nespecially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if\r\nshe dared, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. And if Lucy hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been there,\r\nMaggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner.\r\n\r\nTickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it\r\nis possible to exhaust, and Tom by and by began to look round for some\r\nother mode of passing the time. But in so prim a garden, where they\r\nwere not to go off the paved walks, there was not a great choice of\r\nsport. The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the\r\npleasure of breaking it, and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary\r\nvisit to the pond, about a field\xe2\x80\x99s length beyond the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, nodding his head up and down with great\r\nsignificance, as he coiled up his string again, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think I\r\nmean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to go to the pond and look at the pike. You may go with me if\r\nyou like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young sultan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, _dare_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cAunt said we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go out of the\r\ngarden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall go out at the other end of the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull see us. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if they do,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll run off home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t run,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, who had never before been exposed to\r\nsuch severe temptation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind; they won\xe2\x80\x99t be cross with _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say I\r\ntook you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his side, timidly enjoying the\r\nrare treat of doing something naughty,\xe2\x80\x94excited also by the mention of\r\nthat celebrity, the pike, about which she was quite uncertain whether\r\nit was a fish or a fowl.\r\n\r\nMaggie saw them leaving the garden, and could not resist the impulse to\r\nfollow. Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their\r\nobjects than love, and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of\r\nwhich she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie.\r\nSo she kept a few yards behind them, unobserved by Tom, who was\r\npresently absorbed in watching for the pike,\xe2\x80\x94a highly interesting\r\nmonster; he was said to be so very old, so very large, and to have such\r\na remarkable appetite. The pike, like other celebrities, did not show\r\nwhen he was watched for, but Tom caught sight of something in rapid\r\nmovement in the water, which attracted him to another spot on the brink\r\nof the pond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Lucy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a loud whisper, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here! take care! keep on\r\nthe grass!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t step where the cows have been!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to\r\na peninsula of dry grass, with trodden mud on each side of it; for\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being\r\nunfit to walk in dirty places.\r\n\r\nLucy came carefully as she was bidden, and bent down to look at what\r\nseemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water. It was a\r\nwater-snake, Tom told her; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine\r\nwave of its body, very much wondering that a snake could swim. Maggie\r\nhad drawn nearer and nearer; she _must_ see it too, though it was\r\nbitter to her, like everything else, since Tom did not care about her\r\nseeing it. At last she was close by Lucy; and Tom, who had been aware\r\nof her approach, but would not notice it till he was obliged, turned\r\nround and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, get away, Maggie; there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for you on the grass here.\r\nNobody asked _you_ to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a\r\ntragedy, if tragedies were made by passion only; but the essential \xcf\x84\xce\xb9\r\n\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 which was present in the passion was wanting to the action; the\r\nutmost Maggie could do, with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm,\r\nwas to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into the cow-trodden mud.\r\n\r\nThen Tom could not restrain himself, and gave Maggie two smart slaps on\r\nthe arm as he ran to pick up Lucy, who lay crying helplessly. Maggie\r\nretreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off, and looked on\r\nimpenitently. Usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed,\r\nbut now Tom and Lucy had made her so miserable, she was glad to spoil\r\ntheir happiness,\xe2\x80\x94glad to make everybody uncomfortable. Why should she\r\nbe sorry? Tom was very slow to forgive _her_, however sorry she might\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, loudly and\r\nemphatically, as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away. It was not\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s practice to \xe2\x80\x9ctell,\xe2\x80\x9d but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie\r\nshould be visited with the utmost punishment; not that Tom had learned\r\nto put his views in that abstract form; he never mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cjustice,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine\r\nname. Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x94the spoiling of her pretty best clothes, and the discomfort of\r\nbeing wet and dirty,\xe2\x80\x94to think much of the cause, which was entirely\r\nmysterious to her. She could never have guessed what she had done to\r\nmake Maggie angry with her; but she felt that Maggie was very unkind\r\nand disagreeable, and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he\r\nwould not \xe2\x80\x9ctell,\xe2\x80\x9d only running along by his side and crying piteously,\r\nwhile Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with\r\nher small Medusa face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when they reached the kitchen door, and Sally looked\r\nat them in speechless amaze, with a piece of bread-and-butter in her\r\nmouth and a toasting-fork in her hand,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSally, tell mother it was\r\nMaggie pushed Lucy into the mud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Lors ha\xe2\x80\x99 massy, how did you get near such mud as that?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSally, making a wry face, as she stooped down and examined the _corpus\r\ndelicti_.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include\r\nthis question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner put\r\nthan he foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be\r\nconsidered the only culprit in the case. He walked quietly away from\r\nthe kitchen door, leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which\r\nactive minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge.\r\n\r\nSally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlour\r\ndoor, for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum\r\nFirs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d aunt Pullet exclaimed, after preluding by an\r\ninarticulate scream; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep her at the door, Sally! Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring her off\r\nthe oil-cloth, whatever you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s tumbled into some nasty mud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, going up\r\nto Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she\r\nfelt herself responsible to her sister Deane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, \xe2\x80\x99um, it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Tom\xe2\x80\x99s been and said so, and they must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been to the pond, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only there they could ha\xe2\x80\x99 got into such dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is, Bessy; it\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet,\r\nin a tone of prophetic sadness; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s your children,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing\r\nwhat they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was mute, feeling herself a truly wretched mother. As\r\nusual, the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had\r\ndone something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles, while Mrs\r\nPullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the\r\npremises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt.\r\nMeantime tea was to be brought in by the cook, and the two naughty\r\nchildren were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen.\r\nMrs Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children, supposing\r\nthem to be close at hand; but it was not until after some search that\r\nshe found Tom leaning with rather a hardened, careless air against the\r\nwhite paling of the poultry-yard, and lowering his piece of string on\r\nthe other side as a means of exasperating the turkey-cock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you naughty boy, where\xe2\x80\x99s your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, in a\r\ndistressed voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; his eagerness for justice on Maggie had\r\ndiminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought\r\nabout without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where did you leave her?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, looking round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSitting under the tree, against the pond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, apparently\r\nindifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go and fetch her in this minute, you naughty boy. And how could\r\nyou think o\xe2\x80\x99 going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was\r\ndirt? You know she\xe2\x80\x99ll do mischief if there\xe2\x80\x99s mischief to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s way, if she blamed Tom, to refer his\r\nmisdemeanour, somehow or other, to Maggie.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in\r\nMrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and she mounted the horse-block to satisfy herself\r\nby a sight of that fatal child, while Tom walked\xe2\x80\x94not very quickly\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nhis way toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re such children for the water, mine are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud,\r\nwithout reflecting that there was no one to hear her; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbrought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that river was far\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when she not only failed to discern Maggie, but presently saw Tom\r\nreturning from the pool alone, this hovering fear entered and took\r\ncomplete possession of her, and she hurried to meet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere about the pond, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou may conceive the terrified search for Maggie, and the difficulty of\r\nconvincing her mother that she was not in the pond. Mrs Pullet observed\r\nthat the child might come to a worse end if she lived, there was no\r\nknowing; and Mr Pullet, confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary\r\naspect of things,\xe2\x80\x94the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the\r\nunusual running to and fro,\xe2\x80\x94took up his spud as an instrument of\r\nsearch, and reached down a key to unlock the goose-pen, as a likely\r\nplace for Maggie to lie concealed in.\r\n\r\nTom, after a while, started the idea that Maggie was gone home (without\r\nthinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done\r\nhimself under the circumstances), and the suggestion was seized as a\r\ncomfort by his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake let \xe2\x80\x99em put the horse in the carriage and\r\ntake me home; we shall perhaps find her on the road. Lucy can\xe2\x80\x99t walk in\r\nher dirty clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at that innocent victim, who was\r\nwrapped up in a shawl, and sitting with naked feet on the sofa.\r\n\r\nAunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring\r\nher premises to order and quiet, and it was not long before Mrs\r\nTulliver was in the chaise, looking anxiously at the most distant point\r\nbefore her. What the father would say if Maggie was lost, was a\r\nquestion that predominated over every other.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nMaggie Tries to Run away from Her Shadow\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, as usual, were on a larger scale than Tom\r\nimagined. The resolution that gathered in her mind, after Tom and Lucy\r\nhad walked away, was not so simple as that of going home. No! she would\r\nrun away and go to the gypsies, and Tom should never see her any more.\r\nThat was by no means a new idea to Maggie; she had been so often told\r\nshe was like a gypsy, and \xe2\x80\x9chalf wild,\xe2\x80\x9d that when she was miserable it\r\nseemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium, and being entirely\r\nin harmony with circumstances, would be to live in a little brown tent\r\non the commons; the gypsies, she considered, would gladly receive her\r\nand pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge. She had\r\nonce mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested that he\r\nshould stain his face brown, and they should run away together; but Tom\r\nrejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gypsies were thieves,\r\nand hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey.\r\nTo-day however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which\r\ngypsydom was her refuge, and she rose from her seat on the roots of the\r\ntree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life; she would\r\nrun straight away till she came to Dunlow Common, where there would\r\ncertainly be gypsies; and cruel Tom, and the rest of her relations who\r\nfound fault with her, should never see her any more. She thought of her\r\nfather as she ran along, but she reconciled herself to the idea of\r\nparting with him, by determining that she would secretly send him a\r\nletter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where she\r\nwas, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always\r\nloved him very much.\r\n\r\nMaggie soon got out of breath with running, but by the time Tom got to\r\nthe pond again she was at the distance of three long fields, and was on\r\nthe edge of the lane leading to the highroad. She stopped to pant a\r\nlittle, reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one\r\nhad got quite to the common where the gypsies were, but her resolution\r\nhad not abated; she presently passed through the gate into the lane,\r\nnot knowing where it would lead her, for it was not this way that they\r\ncame from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs, and she felt all the safer for\r\nthat, because there was no chance of her being overtaken. But she was\r\nsoon aware, not without trembling, that there were two men coming along\r\nthe lane in front of her; she had not thought of meeting strangers, she\r\nhad been too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after\r\nher. The formidable strangers were two shabby-looking men with flushed\r\nfaces, one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his shoulder; but\r\nto her surprise, while she was dreading their disapprobation as a\r\nrunaway, the man with the bundle stopped, and in a half-whining,\r\nhalf-coaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor man.\r\nMaggie had a sixpence in her pocket,\xe2\x80\x94her uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s present,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nshe immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a polite smile,\r\nhoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only money I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\r\nlittle miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, in a less respectful and grateful tone than\r\nMaggie anticipated, and she even observed that he smiled and winked at\r\nhis companion. She walked on hurriedly, but was aware that the two men\r\nwere standing still, probably to look after her, and she presently\r\nheard them laughing loudly. Suddenly it occurred to her that they might\r\nthink she was an idiot; Tom had said that her cropped hair made her\r\nlook like an idiot, and it was too painful an idea to be readily\r\nforgotten. Besides, she had no sleeves on,\xe2\x80\x94only a cape and bonnet. It\r\nwas clear that she was not likely to make a favourable impression on\r\npassengers, and she thought she would turn into the fields again, but\r\nnot on the same side of the lane as before, lest they should still be\r\nuncle Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s fields. She turned through the first gate that was not\r\nlocked, and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the\r\nhedgerows, after her recent humiliating encounter. She was used to\r\nwandering about the fields by herself, and was less timid there than on\r\nthe highroad. Sometimes she had to climb over high gates, but that was\r\na small evil; she was getting out of reach very fast, and she should\r\nprobably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common, or at least of some\r\nother common, for she had heard her father say that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nvery far without coming to a common. She hoped so, for she was getting\r\nrather tired and hungry, and until she reached the gypsies there was no\r\ndefinite prospect of bread and butter. It was still broad daylight, for\r\naunt Pullet, retaining the early habits of the Dodson family, took tea\r\nat half-past four by the sun, and at five by the kitchen clock; so,\r\nthough it was nearly an hour since Maggie started, there was no\r\ngathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come.\r\nStill, it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance\r\nindeed, and it was really surprising that the common did not come\r\nwithin sight. Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum, where\r\nwas a great deal of pasture-land, and she had only seen one labourer at\r\na distance. That was fortunate in some respects, as labourers might be\r\ntoo ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow\r\nCommon; yet it would have been better if she could have met some one\r\nwho would tell her the way without wanting to know anything about her\r\nprivate business. At last, however, the green fields came to an end,\r\nand Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane\r\nwith a wide margin of grass on each side of it. She had never seen such\r\na wide lane before, and, without her knowing why, it gave her the\r\nimpression that the common could not be far off; perhaps it was because\r\nshe saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin,\r\nfor she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow\r\nCommon when she had been across it in her father\xe2\x80\x99s gig. She crept\r\nthrough the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit, though not\r\nwithout haunting images of Apollyon, and a highwayman with a pistol,\r\nand a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear, and other\r\nmiscellaneous dangers. For poor little Maggie had at once the timidity\r\nof an active imagination and the daring that comes from overmastering\r\nimpulse. She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown\r\nkindred, the gypsies; and now she was in this strange lane, she hardly\r\ndared look on one side of her, lest she should see the diabolical\r\nblacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo. It\r\nwas not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small\r\npair of bare legs sticking up, feet uppermost, by the side of a\r\nhillock; they seemed something hideously preternatural,\xe2\x80\x94a diabolical\r\nkind of fungus; for she was too much agitated at the first glance to\r\nsee the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them. It\r\nwas a boy asleep, and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly,\r\nlest she should wake him; it did not occur to her that he was one of\r\nher friends the gypsies, who in all probability would have very genial\r\nmanners. But the fact was so, for at the next bend in the lane Maggie\r\nactually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke\r\nrising before it, which was to be her refuge from all the blighting\r\nobloquy that had pursued her in civilised life. She even saw a tall\r\nfemale figure by the column of smoke, doubtless the gypsy-mother, who\r\nprovided the tea and other groceries; it was astonishing to herself\r\nthat she did not feel more delighted. But it was startling to find the\r\ngypsies in a lane, after all, and not on a common; indeed, it was\r\nrather disappointing; for a mysterious illimitable common, where there\r\nwere sand-pits to hide in, and one was out of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s reach, had\r\nalways made part of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s picture of gypsy life. She went on,\r\nhowever, and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew\r\nnothing about idiots, so there was no danger of their falling into the\r\nmistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot. It was\r\nplain she had attracted attention; for the tall figure, who proved to\r\nbe a young woman with a baby on her arm, walked slowly to meet her.\r\nMaggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached,\r\nand was reassured by the thought that her aunt Pullet and the rest were\r\nright when they called her a gypsy; for this face, with the bright dark\r\neyes and the long hair, was really something like what she used to see\r\nin the glass before she cut her hair off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little lady, where are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d the gypsy said, in a tone of\r\ncoaxing deference.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful, and just what Maggie expected; the gypsies saw at\r\nonce that she was a little lady, and were prepared to treat her\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, feeling as if she were saying what she\r\nhad rehearsed in a dream. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come to stay with _you_, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty; come, then. Why, what a nice little lady you are, to be\r\nsure!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gypsy, taking her by the hand. Maggie thought her very\r\nagreeable, but wished she had not been so dirty.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a group round the fire when she reached it. An old\r\ngypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees, and\r\noccasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an\r\nodorous steam; two small shock-headed children were lying prone and\r\nresting on their elbows something like small sphinxes; and a placid\r\ndonkey was bending his head over a tall girl, who, lying on her back,\r\nwas scratching his nose and indulging him with a bite of excellent\r\nstolen hay. The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them, and the scene\r\nwas really very pretty and comfortable, Maggie thought, only she hoped\r\nthey would soon set out the tea-cups. Everything would be quite\r\ncharming when she had taught the gypsies to use a washing-basin, and to\r\nfeel an interest in books. It was a little confusing, though, that the\r\nyoung woman began to speak to the old one in a language which Maggie\r\ndid not understand, while the tall girl, who was feeding the donkey,\r\nsat up and stared at her without offering any salutation. At last the\r\nold woman said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! my pretty lady, are you come to stay with us? Sit ye down and\r\ntell us where you come from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just like a story; Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and\r\ntreated in this way. She sat down and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come from home because I\xe2\x80\x99m unhappy, and I mean to be a gypsy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlive with you if you like, and I can teach you a great many things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a clever little lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman with the baby sitting down\r\nby Maggie, and allowing baby to crawl; \xe2\x80\x9cand such a pretty bonnet and\r\nfrock,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, taking off Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet and looking at it while\r\nshe made an observation to the old woman, in the unknown language. The\r\ntall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind-foremost\r\nwith a grin; but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this\r\nsubject, as if she were susceptible about her bonnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wear a bonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather wear a red\r\nhandkerchief, like yours\xe2\x80\x9d (looking at her friend by her side). \xe2\x80\x9cMy hair\r\nwas quite long till yesterday, when I cut it off; but I dare say it\r\nwill grow again very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she added apologetically, thinking it\r\nprobable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favour of long hair. And\r\nMaggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to\r\nconciliate gypsy opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a nice little lady!\xe2\x80\x94and rich, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you live in a beautiful house at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my home is pretty, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of the river, where we go\r\nfishing, but I\xe2\x80\x99m often very unhappy. I should have liked to bring my\r\nbooks with me, but I came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell you\r\nalmost everything there is in my books, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read them so many times,\r\nand that will amuse you. And I can tell you something about Geography\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s about the world we live in,\xe2\x80\x94very useful and interesting.\r\nDid you ever hear about Columbus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush,\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nreally beginning to instruct the gypsies, and gaining great influence\r\nover them. The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this\r\ntalk, though their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket, which the friend at her right hand had by this time emptied\r\nwithout attracting her notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that where you live, my little lady?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, at the\r\nmention of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with some pity; \xe2\x80\x9cColumbus was a very wonderful\r\nman, who found out half the world, and they put chains on him and\r\ntreated him very badly, you know; it\xe2\x80\x99s in my Catechism of Geography,\r\nbut perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s rather too long to tell before tea\xe2\x80\x94_I want my tea\r\nso_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words burst from Maggie, in spite of herself, with a sudden\r\ndrop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, poor little lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger woman. \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nher some o\xe2\x80\x99 the cold victual. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been walking a good way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound, my dear. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Dorlcote Mill, a good way off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father is Mr\r\nTulliver, but we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let him know where I am, else he\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch me\r\nhome again. Where does the queen of the gypsies live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you want to go to her, my little lady?\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger\r\nwoman. The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and\r\ngrinning. Her manners were certainly not agreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only thinking that if she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good\r\nqueen you might be glad when she died, and you could choose another. If\r\nI was a queen, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a very good queen, and kind to everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 nice victual, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, handing to\r\nMaggie a lump of dry bread, which she had taken from a bag of scraps,\r\nand a piece of cold bacon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Maggie, looking at the food without taking it; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwill you give me some bread-and-butter and tea instead? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nbacon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got no tea nor butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, with something like\r\na scowl, as if she were getting tired of coaxing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a little bread and treacle would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe han\xe2\x80\x99t got no treacle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, crossly, whereupon there\r\nfollowed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown\r\ntongue, and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread-and-bacon,\r\nand began to eat it. At this moment the tall girl, who had gone a few\r\nyards off, came back, and said something which produced a strong\r\neffect. The old woman, seeming to forget Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s hunger, poked the\r\nskewer into the pot with new vigor, and the younger crept under the\r\ntent and reached out some platters and spoons. Maggie trembled a\r\nlittle, and was afraid the tears would come into her eyes. Meanwhile\r\nthe tall girl gave a shrill cry, and presently came running up the boy\r\nwhom Maggie had passed as he was sleeping,\xe2\x80\x94a rough urchin about the age\r\nof Tom. He stared at Maggie, and there ensued much incomprehensible\r\nchattering. She felt very lonely, and was quite sure she should begin\r\nto cry before long; the gypsies didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind her at all, and she\r\nfelt quite weak among them. But the springing tears were checked by new\r\nterror, when two men came up, whose approach had been the cause of the\r\nsudden excitement. The elder of the two carried a bag, which he flung\r\ndown, addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone, which they\r\nanswered by a shower of treble sauciness; while a black cur ran barking\r\nup to Maggie, and threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause\r\nin the curses with which the younger man called the dog off, and gave\r\nhim a rap with a great stick he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nMaggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these\r\npeople, or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie, for they looked\r\nat her, and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind\r\nwhich implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on\r\nthe other. At last the younger woman said in her previous deferential,\r\ncoaxing tone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis nice little lady\xe2\x80\x99s come to live with us; aren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger man, who was looking at Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her\r\npocket. He returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman,\r\nwith some observation, and she immediately restored them to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket, while the men seated themselves, and began to attack the\r\ncontents of the kettle,\xe2\x80\x94a stew of meat and potatoes,\xe2\x80\x94which had been\r\ntaken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter.\r\n\r\nMaggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies; they\r\nmust certainly be thieves, unless the man meant to return her thimble\r\nby and by. She would willingly have given it to him, for she was not at\r\nall attached to her thimble; but the idea that she was among thieves\r\nprevented her from feeling any comfort in the revival of deference and\r\nattention toward her; all thieves, except Robin Hood, were wicked\r\npeople. The women saw she was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing nice for a lady to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, in her\r\ncoaxing tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s so hungry, sweet little lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my dear, try if you can eat a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger\r\nwoman, handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to\r\nMaggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her\r\nfor not liking the bread-and-bacon, dared not refuse the stew, though\r\nfear had chased away her appetite. If her father would but come by in\r\nthe gig and take her up! Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr\r\nGreatheart, or St George who slew the dragon on the half-pennies, would\r\nhappen to pass that way! But Maggie thought with a sinking heart that\r\nthese heroes were never seen in the neighbourhood of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s; nothing\r\nvery wonderful ever came there.\r\n\r\nMaggie Tulliver, you perceive, was by no means that well trained,\r\nwell-informed young person that a small female of eight or nine\r\nnecessarily is in these days; she had only been to school a year at St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, and had so few books that she sometimes read the dictionary; so\r\nthat in travelling over her small mind you would have found the most\r\nunexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge. She could have\r\ninformed you that there was such a word as \xe2\x80\x9cpolygamy,\xe2\x80\x9d and being also\r\nacquainted with \xe2\x80\x9cpolysyllable,\xe2\x80\x9d she had deduced the conclusion that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoly\xe2\x80\x9d mean \xe2\x80\x9cmany\xe2\x80\x9d; but she had had no idea that gypsies were not well\r\nsupplied with groceries, and her thoughts generally were the oddest\r\nmixture of clear-eyed acumen and blind dreams.\r\n\r\nHer ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the\r\nlast five minutes. From having considered them very respectful\r\ncompanions, amenable to instruction, she had begun to think that they\r\nmeant perhaps to kill her as soon as it was dark, and cut up her body\r\nfor gradual cooking; the suspicion crossed her that the fierce-eyed old\r\nman was in fact the Devil, who might drop that transparent disguise at\r\nany moment, and turn either into the grinning blacksmith, or else a\r\nfiery-eyed monster with dragon\xe2\x80\x99s wings. It was no use trying to eat the\r\nstew, and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the gypsies, by\r\nbetraying her extremely unfavourable opinion of them; and she wondered,\r\nwith a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded,\r\nwhether, if the Devil were really present, he would know her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the smell of it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman,\r\nobserving that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew. \xe2\x80\x9cTry a\r\nbit, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, summoning all her force for a desperate\r\neffort, and trying to smile in a friendly way. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t time, I\r\nthink; it seems getting darker. I think I must go home now, and come\r\nagain another day, and then I can bring you a basket with some\r\njam-tarts and things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect,\r\ndevoutly hoping that Apollyon was gullible; but her hope sank when the\r\nold gypsy-woman said, \xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, stop a bit, little lady; we\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nyou home, all safe, when we\xe2\x80\x99ve done supper; you shall ride home, like a\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie sat down again, with little faith in this promise, though she\r\npresently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey, and\r\nthrowing a couple of bags on his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, little missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger man, rising, and leading\r\nthe donkey forward, \xe2\x80\x9ctell us where you live; what\xe2\x80\x99s the name o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDorlcote Mill is my home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father is Mr\r\nTulliver; he lives there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! a big mill a little way this side o\xe2\x80\x99 St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it far off? I think I should like to walk\r\nthere, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting dark, we must make haste. And the donkey\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncarry you as nice as can be; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted Maggie as he spoke, and set her on the donkey. She felt\r\nrelieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her,\r\nbut she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your pretty bonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger woman, putting that\r\nrecently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ll say we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very good to you, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? and what a nice\r\nlittle lady we said you was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you. But I\r\nwish you\xe2\x80\x99d go with me too.\xe2\x80\x9d She thought anything was better than going\r\nwith one of the dreadful men alone; it would be more cheerful to be\r\nmurdered by a larger party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re fondest o\xe2\x80\x99 _me_, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo; you\xe2\x80\x99ll go too fast for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey,\r\nholding Maggie before him, and she was as incapable of remonstrating\r\nagainst this arrangement as the donkey himself, though no nightmare had\r\never seemed to her more horrible. When the woman had patted her on the\r\nback, and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d the donkey, at a strong hint from the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstick, set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point Maggie\r\nhad come from an hour ago, while the tall girl and the rough urchin,\r\nalso furnished with sticks, obligingly escorted them for the first\r\nhundred yards, with much screaming and thwacking.\r\n\r\nNot Leonore, in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom\r\nlover, was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural\r\nride on a short-paced donkey, with a gypsy behind her, who considered\r\nthat he was earning half a crown. The red light of the setting sun\r\nseemed to have a portentous meaning, with which the alarming bray of\r\nthe second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some\r\nconnection. Two low thatched cottages\xe2\x80\x94the only houses they passed in\r\nthis lane\xe2\x80\x94seemed to add to its dreariness; they had no windows to speak\r\nof, and the doors were closed; it was probable that they were\r\ninhabitated by witches, and it was a relief to find that the donkey did\r\nnot stop there.\r\n\r\nAt last\xe2\x80\x94oh, sight of joy!\xe2\x80\x94this lane, the longest in the world, was\r\ncoming to an end, was opening on a broad highroad, where there was\r\nactually a coach passing! And there was a finger-post at the\r\ncorner,\xe2\x80\x94she had surely seen that finger-post before,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, 2\r\nmiles.\xe2\x80\x9d The gypsy really meant to take her home, then; he was probably\r\na good man, after all, and might have been rather hurt at the thought\r\nthat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like coming with him alone. This idea became stronger\r\nas she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well,\r\nand she was considering how she might open a conversation with the\r\ninjured gypsy, and not only gratify his feelings but efface the\r\nimpression of her cowardice, when, as they reached a cross-road. Maggie\r\ncaught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my father! Oh, father,\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden joy was almost painful, and before her father reached her,\r\nshe was sobbing. Great was Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s wonder, for he had made a\r\nround from Basset, and had not yet been home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning o\xe2\x80\x99 this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, checking his horse, while\r\nMaggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father\xe2\x80\x99s stirrup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little miss lost herself, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gypsy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d come\r\nto our tent at the far end o\xe2\x80\x99 Dunlow Lane, and I was bringing her where\r\nshe said her home was. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to come after being on the tramp\r\nall day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, father, he\xe2\x80\x99s been very good to bring me home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nvery kind, good man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, my man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, taking out five shillings.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best day\xe2\x80\x99s work _you_ ever did. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose the\r\nlittle wench; here, lift her up before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Maggie, how\xe2\x80\x99s this, how\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they rode along,\r\nwhile she laid her head against her father and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to\r\nbe rambling about and lose yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI ran away because I was so unhappy; Tom\r\nwas so angry with me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, soothingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrunning away from father. What \xe2\x80\x99ud father do without his little wench?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I never will again, father\xe2\x80\x94never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that\r\nevening; and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie\r\nnever heard one reproach from her mother, or one taunt from Tom, about\r\nthis foolish business of her running away to the gypsies. Maggie was\r\nrather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment, and sometimes thought\r\nthat her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Glegg at Home\r\n\r\nIn order to see Mr and Mrs Glegg at home, we must enter the town of St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad\r\nwarehouse gables, where the black ships unlade themselves of their\r\nburthens from the far north, and carry away, in exchange, the precious\r\ninland products, the well-crushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my\r\nrefined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through the\r\nmedium of the best classic pastorals.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation\r\nand outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the\r\nwinding galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the traces of\r\nits long growth and history like a millennial tree, and has sprung up\r\nand developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from\r\nthe time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp\r\non the hillside, and the long-haired sea-kings came up the river and\r\nlooked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness of the land. It is a town\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar with forgotten years.\xe2\x80\x9d The shadow of the Saxon hero-king\r\nstill walks there fitfully, reviewing the scenes of his youth and\r\nlove-time, and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen\r\nDane, who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an\r\ninvisible avenger, and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist\r\nfrom his tumulus on the hill, and hovers in the court of the old hall\r\nby the river-side, the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the\r\ndays before the old hall was built. It was the Normans who began to\r\nbuild that fine old hall, which is, like the town, telling of the\r\nthoughts and hands of widely sundered generations; but it is all so old\r\nthat we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies, and are well\r\ncontent that they who built the stone oriel, and they who built the\r\nGothic fa\xc3\xa7ade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil\r\nornament, and the windows and battlements defined with stone, did not\r\nsacrilegiously pull down the ancient half-timbered body with its\r\noak-roofed banqueting-hall.\r\n\r\nBut older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built\r\ninto the belfry of the parish church, and said to be a remnant of the\r\noriginal chapel dedicated to St Ogg, the patron saint of this ancient\r\ntown, of whose history I possess several manuscript versions. I incline\r\nto the briefest, since, if it should not be wholly true, it is at least\r\nlikely to contain the least falsehood. \xe2\x80\x9cOgg the son of Beorl,\xe2\x80\x9d says my\r\nprivate hagiographer, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a boatman who gained a scanty living by\r\nferrying passengers across the river Floss. And it came to pass, one\r\nevening when the winds were high, that there sat moaning by the brink\r\nof the river a woman with a child in her arms; and she was clad in\r\nrags, and had a worn and withered look, and she craved to be rowed\r\nacross the river. And the men thereabout questioned her, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river? Tarry till the morning,\r\nand take shelter here for the night; so shalt thou be wise and not\r\nfoolish.\xe2\x80\x99 Still she went on to mourn and crave. But Ogg the son of\r\nBeorl came up and said, \xe2\x80\x98I will ferry thee across; it is enough that\r\nthy heart needs it.\xe2\x80\x99 And he ferried her across. And it came to pass,\r\nwhen she stepped ashore, that her rags were turned into robes of\r\nflowing white, and her face became bright with exceeding beauty, and\r\nthere was a glory around it, so that she shed a light on the water like\r\nthe moon in its brightness. And she said, \xe2\x80\x98Ogg, the son of Beorl, thou\r\nart blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle with the\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s need, but wast smitten with pity, and didst straightway relieve\r\nthe same. And from henceforth whoso steps into thy boat shall be in no\r\nperil from the storm; and whenever it puts forth to the rescue, it\r\nshall save the lives both of men and beasts.\xe2\x80\x99 And when the floods came,\r\nmany were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat. But when Ogg\r\nthe son of Beorl died, behold, in the parting of his soul, the boat\r\nloosed itself from its moorings, and was floated with the ebbing tide\r\nin great swiftness to the ocean, and was seen no more. Yet it was\r\nwitnessed in the floods of aftertime, that at the coming on of\r\neventide, Ogg the son of Beorl was always seen with his boat upon the\r\nwide-spreading waters, and the Blessed Virgin sat in the prow, shedding\r\na light around as of the moon in its brightness, so that the rowers in\r\nthe gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis legend, one sees, reflects from a far-off time the visitation of\r\nthe floods, which, even when they left human life untouched, were\r\nwidely fatal to the helpless cattle, and swept as sudden death over all\r\nsmaller living things. But the town knew worse troubles even than the\r\nfloods,\xe2\x80\x94troubles of the civil wars, when it was a continual\r\nfighting-place, where first Puritans thanked God for the blood of the\r\nLoyalists, and then Loyalists thanked God for the blood of the\r\nPuritans. Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for\r\nconscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake in those times, and went forth beggared from their\r\nnative town. Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which\r\nthose honest citizens turned their backs in sorrow,\xe2\x80\x94quaint-gabled\r\nhouses looking on the river, jammed between newer warehouses, and\r\npenetrated by surprising passages, which turn and turn at sharp angles\r\ntill they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the\r\nrushing tide. Everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look, and in\r\nMrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s day there was no incongruous new-fashioned smartness, no\r\nplate-glass in shop-windows, no fresh stucco-facing or other fallacious\r\nattempt to make fine old red St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s wear the air of a town that\r\nsprang up yesterday. The shop-windows were small and unpretending; for\r\nthe farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives and daughters who came to do their shopping on\r\nmarket-days were not to be withdrawn from their regular well-known\r\nshops; and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would\r\ngo on their way and be seen no more. Ah! even Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s day seems far\r\nback in the past now, separated from us by changes that widen the\r\nyears. War and the rumor of war had then died out from the minds of\r\nmen, and if they were ever thought of by the farmers in drab\r\ngreatcoats, who shook the grain out of their sample-bags and buzzed\r\nover it in the full market-place, it was as a state of things that\r\nbelonged to a past golden age when prices were high. Surely the time\r\nwas gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships;\r\nRussia was only the place where the linseed came from,\xe2\x80\x94the more the\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x94making grist for the great vertical millstones with their\r\nscythe-like arms, roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an\r\ninforming soul were in them. The Catholics, bad harvests, and the\r\nmysterious fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to\r\nfear; even the floods had not been great of late years. The mind of St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s did not look extensively before or after. It inherited a long\r\npast without thinking of it, and had no eyes for the spirits that walk\r\nthe streets. Since the centuries when St Ogg with his boat and the\r\nVirgin Mother at the prow had been seen on the wide water, so many\r\nmemories had been left behind, and had gradually vanished like the\r\nreceding hilltops! And the present time was like the level plain where\r\nmen lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes, thinking to-morrow\r\nwill be as yesterday, and the giant forces that used to shake the earth\r\nare forever laid to sleep. The days were gone when people could be\r\ngreatly wrought upon by their faith, still less change it; the\r\nCatholics were formidable because they would lay hold of government and\r\nproperty, and burn men alive; not because any sane and honest\r\nparishioner of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s could be brought to believe in the Pope. One\r\naged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when John\r\nWesley preached in the cattle-market; but for a long while it had not\r\nbeen expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men. An\r\noccasional burst of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of\r\ninfant baptism was the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times\r\nwhen men had done with change. Protestantism sat at ease, unmindful of\r\nschisms, careless of proselytism: Dissent was an inheritance along with\r\na superior pew and a business connection; and Churchmanship only\r\nwondered contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit that clung\r\ngreatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines, though not\r\nincompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing. But with the Catholic\r\nQuestion had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm: the\r\nelderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative;\r\nand Mr Spray, the Independent minister, had begun to preach political\r\nsermons, in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his\r\nfervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his\r\nfervent belief in their eternal perdition. Most of Mr Spray\xe2\x80\x99s hearers,\r\nhowever, were incapable of following his subtleties, and many\r\nold-fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his \xe2\x80\x9csiding with the\r\nCatholics\xe2\x80\x9d; while others thought he had better let politics alone.\r\nPublic spirit was not held in high esteem at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and men who\r\nbusied themselves with political questions were regarded with some\r\nsuspicion, as dangerous characters; they were usually persons who had\r\nlittle or no business of their own to manage, or, if they had, were\r\nlikely enough to become insolvent.\r\n\r\nThis was the general aspect of things at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s in Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s day,\r\nand at that particular period in her family history when she had had\r\nher quarrel with Mr Tulliver. It was a time when ignorance was much\r\nmore comfortable than at present, and was received with all the honours\r\nin very good society, without being obliged to dress itself in an\r\nelaborate costume of knowledge; a time when cheap periodicals were not,\r\nand when country surgeons never thought of asking their female patients\r\nif they were fond of reading, but simply took it for granted that they\r\npreferred gossip; a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore large\r\npockets, in which they carried a mutton-bone to secure them against\r\ncramp. Mrs Glegg carried such a bone, which she had inherited from her\r\ngrandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty, like a suit\r\nof armor, and a silver-headed walking-stick; for the Dodson family had\r\nbeen respectable for many generations.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg had both a front and a back parlour in her excellent house at\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, so that she had two points of view from which she could\r\nobserve the weakness of her fellow-beings, and reinforce her\r\nthankfulness for her own exceptional strength of mind. From her front\r\nwindow she could look down the Tofton Road, leading out of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand note the growing tendency to \xe2\x80\x9cgadding about\xe2\x80\x9d in the wives of men\r\nnot retired from business, together with a practice of wearing woven\r\ncotton stockings, which opened a dreary prospect for the coming\r\ngeneration; and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant\r\ngarden and orchard which stretched to the river, and observe the folly\r\nof Mr Glegg in spending his time among \xe2\x80\x9cthem flowers and vegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFor Mr Glegg, having retired from active business as a wool-stapler for\r\nthe purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life, had found\r\nthis last occupation so much more severe than his business, that he had\r\nbeen driven into amateur hard labour as a dissipation, and habitually\r\nrelaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners. The economizing of\r\na gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wages might perhaps have induced Mrs Glegg to wink at this\r\nfolly, if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate\r\nrespect for a husband\xe2\x80\x99s hobby. But it is well known that this conjugal\r\ncomplacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex, who are\r\nscarcely alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check\r\non her husband\xe2\x80\x99s pleasures, which are hardly ever of a rational or\r\ncommendable kind.\r\n\r\nMr Glegg on his side, too, had a double source of mental occupation,\r\nwhich gave every promise of being inexhaustible. On the one hand, he\r\nsurprised himself by his discoveries in natural history, finding that\r\nhis piece of garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars, slugs, and\r\ninsects, which, so far as he had heard, had never before attracted\r\nhuman observation; and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these\r\nzoological phenomena and the great events of that time,\xe2\x80\x94as, for\r\nexample, that before the burning of York Minster there had been\r\nmysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose-trees, together\r\nwith an unusual prevalence of slugs, which he had been puzzled to know\r\nthe meaning of, until it flashed upon him with this melancholy\r\nconflagration. (Mr Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity,\r\nwhich, when disengaged from the wool business, naturally made itself a\r\npathway in other directions.) And his second subject of meditation was\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccontrairiness\xe2\x80\x9d of the female mind, as typically exhibited in Mrs\r\nGlegg. That a creature made\xe2\x80\x94in a genealogical sense\xe2\x80\x94out of a man\xe2\x80\x99s rib,\r\nand in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability\r\nwithout any trouble of her own, should be normally in a state of\r\ncontradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most\r\naccommodating concessions, was a mystery in the scheme of things to\r\nwhich he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of\r\nGenesis. Mr Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome\r\nembodiment of female prudence and thrift, and being himself of a\r\nmoney-getting, money-keeping turn, had calculated on much conjugal\r\nharmony. But in that curious compound, the feminine character, it may\r\neasily happen that the flavour is unpleasant in spite of excellent\r\ningredients; and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a\r\nseasoning that quite spoils its relish. Now, good Mr Glegg himself was\r\nstingy in the most amiable manner; his neighbours called him \xe2\x80\x9cnear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich always means that the person in question is a lovable skinflint.\r\nIf you expressed a preference for cheese-parings, Mr Glegg would\r\nremember to save them for you, with a good-natured delight in\r\ngratifying your palate, and he was given to pet all animals which\r\nrequired no appreciable keep. There was no humbug or hypocrisy about Mr\r\nGlegg; his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s furniture, which a five-pound note from his side pocket would\r\nhave prevented; but a donation of five pounds to a person \xe2\x80\x9cin a small\r\nway of life\xe2\x80\x9d would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather\r\nthan \xe2\x80\x9ccharity,\xe2\x80\x9d which had always presented itself to him as a\r\ncontribution of small aids, not a neutralizing of misfortune. And Mr\r\nGlegg was just as fond of saving other people\xe2\x80\x99s money as his own; he\r\nwould have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses\r\nwere to be paid for him, as when they were to come out of his own\r\npocket, and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent\r\nacquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking. This\r\ninalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged to the\r\nindustrious men of business of a former generation, who made their\r\nfortunes slowly, almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the\r\nharrier,\xe2\x80\x94it constituted them a \xe2\x80\x9crace,\xe2\x80\x9d which is nearly lost in these\r\ndays of rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back of\r\nwant. In old-fashioned times an \xe2\x80\x9cindependence\xe2\x80\x9d was hardly ever made\r\nwithout a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found\r\nthat quality in every provincial district, combined with characters as\r\nvarious as the fruits from which we can extract acid. The true\r\nHarpagons were always marked and exceptional characters; not so the\r\nworthy tax-payers, who, having once pinched from real necessity,\r\nretained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement, with their\r\nwallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as an ingenious\r\nprocess of nibbling out one\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood without leaving any\r\nperceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately prompted to\r\ngive up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred\r\na year, as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital. Mr Glegg\r\nwas one of these men, found so impracticable by chancellors of the\r\nexchequer; and knowing this, you will be the better able to understand\r\nwhy he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible\r\nmarriage, in spite of the too pungent seasoning that nature had given\r\nto the eldest Miss Dodson\xe2\x80\x99s virtues. A man with an affectionate\r\ndisposition, who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental idea of\r\nlife, easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have\r\nsuited him so well, and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling\r\nwithout any sense of alienation. Mr Glegg, being of a reflective turn,\r\nand no longer occupied with wool, had much wondering meditation on the\r\npeculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his\r\ndomestic life; and yet he thought Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s household ways a model\r\nfor her sex. It struck him as a pitiable irregularity in other women if\r\nthey did not roll up their table-napkins with the same tightness and\r\nemphasis as Mrs Glegg did, if their pastry had a less leathery\r\nconsistence, and their damson cheese a less venerable hardness than\r\nhers; nay, even the peculiar combination of grocery and druglike odors\r\nin Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing\r\nin the way of cupboard smells. I am not sure that he would not have\r\nlonged for the quarrelling again, if it had ceased for an entire week;\r\nand it is certain that an acquiescent, mild wife would have left his\r\nmeditations comparatively jejune and barren of mystery.\r\n\r\nMr Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it\r\npained him more to see his wife at variance with others,\xe2\x80\x94even with\r\nDolly, the servant,\xe2\x80\x94than to be in a state of cavil with her himself;\r\nand the quarrel between her and Mr Tulliver vexed him so much that it\r\nquite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state\r\nof his early cabbages, as he walked in his garden before breakfast the\r\nnext morning. Still, he went in to breakfast with some slight hope\r\nthat, now Mrs Glegg had \xe2\x80\x9cslept upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d her anger might be subdued\r\nenough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum. She\r\nhad been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly\r\nquarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other families; that no\r\nDodson had ever been \xe2\x80\x9ccut off with a shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d and no cousin of the\r\nDodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be? For they had no\r\ncousins who had not money out at use, or some houses of their own, at\r\nthe very least.\r\n\r\nThere was one evening-cloud which had always disappeared from Mrs\r\nGlegg\xe2\x80\x99s brow when she sat at the breakfast-table. It was her fuzzy\r\nfront of curls; for as she occupied herself in household matters in the\r\nmorning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so\r\nsuperfluous to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front.\r\nBy half-past ten decorum demanded the front; until then Mrs Glegg could\r\neconomise it, and society would never be any the wiser. But the absence\r\nof that cloud only left it more apparent that the cloud of severity\r\nremained; and Mr Glegg, perceiving this, as he sat down to his\r\nmilkporridge, which it was his old frugal habit to stem his morning\r\nhunger with, prudently resolved to leave the first remark to Mrs Glegg,\r\nlest, to so delicate an article as a lady\xe2\x80\x99s temper, the slightest touch\r\nshould do mischief. People who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a\r\nway of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting privations on\r\nthemselves. That was Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s way. She made her tea weaker than\r\nusual this morning, and declined butter. It was a hard case that a\r\nvigorous mood for quarrelling, so highly capable of using an\r\nopportunity, should not meet with a single remark from Mr Glegg on\r\nwhich to exercise itself. But by and by it appeared that his silence\r\nwould answer the purpose, for he heard himself apostrophised at last in\r\nthat tone peculiar to the wife of one\xe2\x80\x99s bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Glegg! it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor return I get for making you the wife I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade you all these years. If this is the way I\xe2\x80\x99m to be treated, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter ha\xe2\x80\x99 known it before my poor father died, and then, when I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwanted a home, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone elsewhere, as the choice was offered\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Glegg paused from his porridge and looked up, not with any new\r\namazement, but simply with that quiet, habitual wonder with which we\r\nregard constant mysteries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs G., what have I done now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone now, Mr Glegg? _done now?_\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot seeing his way to any pertinent answer, Mr Glegg reverted to his\r\nporridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s husbands in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs Glegg, after a pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas \xe2\x80\x99ud have known how to do something different to siding with\r\neverybody else against their own wives. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong and you can\r\nteach me better. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays heard as it\xe2\x80\x99s the husband\xe2\x80\x99s place to\r\nstand by the wife, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 rejoicing and triumphing when folks\r\ninsult her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what call have you to say that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, rather warmly,\r\nfor though a kind man, he was not as meek as Moses. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I rejoice\r\nor triumph over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s ways o\xe2\x80\x99 doing things worse than speaking out plain, Mr Glegg.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner you\xe2\x80\x99d tell me to my face as you make light of me, than try\r\nto make out as everybody\xe2\x80\x99s in the right but me, and come to your\r\nbreakfast in the morning, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly slept an hour this night, and\r\nsulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSulk at you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, in a tone of angry facetiousness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlike a tipsy man as thinks everybody\xe2\x80\x99s had too much but himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lower yourself with using coarse language to _me_, Mr Glegg! It\r\nmakes you look very small, though you can\xe2\x80\x99t see yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nGlegg, in a tone of energetic compassion. \xe2\x80\x9cA man in your place should\r\nset an example, and talk more sensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but will you listen to sense?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Glegg, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nbest sense I can talk to you is what I said last night,\xe2\x80\x94as you\xe2\x80\x99re i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe wrong to think o\xe2\x80\x99 calling in your money, when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe enough if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d let it alone, all because of a bit of a tiff, and I was in hopes\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 altered your mind this morning. But if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to call it\r\nin, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a hurry now, and breed more enmity in the family,\r\nbut wait till there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty mortgage to be had without any trouble.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment, and\r\nmake no end o\xe2\x80\x99 expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg felt there was really something in this, but she tossed her\r\nhead and emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her silence\r\nwas only an armistice, not a peace. And, in fact hostilities soon broke\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you for my cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea, now, Mrs G.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, seeing\r\nthat she did not proceed to give it him as usual, when he had finished\r\nhis porridge. She lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the head, and\r\nsaid,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you\xe2\x80\x99ll _thank_ me, Mr Glegg. It\xe2\x80\x99s little thanks _I_\r\nget for what I do for folks i\xe2\x80\x99 this world. Though there\xe2\x80\x99s never a woman\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 _your_ side o\xe2\x80\x99 the family, Mr Glegg, as is fit to stand up with me,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99d say it if I was on my dying bed. Not but what I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays\r\nconducted myself civil to your kin, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of \xe2\x80\x99em can say\r\nthe contrary, though my equils they aren\xe2\x80\x99t, and nobody shall make me\r\nsay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better leave finding fault wi\xe2\x80\x99 my kin till you\xe2\x80\x99ve left off\r\nquarrelling with your own, Mrs G.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, with angry sarcasm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you for the milk-jug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s as false a word as ever you spoke, Mr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady,\r\npouring out the milk with unusual profuseness, as much as to say, if he\r\nwanted milk he should have it with a vengeance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfalse. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the woman to quarrel with my own kin; _you_ may, for\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve known you to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nin a tantrum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no quarrel wi\xe2\x80\x99 my sister, Mr Glegg, and it\xe2\x80\x99s false to say it. Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s none o\xe2\x80\x99 my blood, and it was him quarrelled with me, and\r\ndrove me out o\xe2\x80\x99 the house. But perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d have had me stay and be\r\nswore at, Mr Glegg; perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse and\r\nfoul language poured out upo\xe2\x80\x99 your own wife. But, let me tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_your_ disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ever anybody hear the like i\xe2\x80\x99 this parish?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, getting\r\nhot. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman, with everything provided for her, and allowed to keep\r\nher own money the same as if it was settled on her, and with a gig new\r\nstuffed and lined at no end o\xe2\x80\x99 expense, and provided for when I die\r\nbeyond anything she could expect\xe2\x80\x94to go on i\xe2\x80\x99 this way, biting and\r\nsnapping like a mad dog! It\xe2\x80\x99s beyond everything, as God A \xe2\x80\x99mighty\r\nshould ha\xe2\x80\x99 made women _so_.\xe2\x80\x9d (These last words were uttered in a tone\r\nof sorrowful agitation. Mr Glegg pushed his tea from him, and tapped\r\nthe table with both his hands.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Glegg, if those are your feelings, it\xe2\x80\x99s best they should be\r\nknown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, taking off her napkin, and folding it in an\r\nexcited manner. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 my being provided for beyond what I\r\ncould expect, I beg leave to tell you as I\xe2\x80\x99d a right to expect a many\r\nthings as I don\xe2\x80\x99t find. And as to my being like a mad dog, it\xe2\x80\x99s well if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not cried shame on by the county for your treatment of me, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t bear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s voice intimated that she was going to cry, and\r\nbreaking off from speech, she rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising from her chair, and speaking in rather a\r\nchoked voice, \xe2\x80\x9clight a fire up-stairs, and put the blinds down. Mr\r\nGlegg, you\xe2\x80\x99ll please to order what you\xe2\x80\x99d like for dinner. I shall have\r\ngruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg walked across the room to the small book-case, and took down\r\nBaxter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSaints\xe2\x80\x99 Everlasting Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d which she carried with her\r\nup-stairs. It was the book she was accustomed to lay open before her on\r\nspecial occasions,\xe2\x80\x94on wet Sunday mornings, or when she heard of a death\r\nin the family, or when, as in this case, her quarrel with Mr Glegg had\r\nbeen set an octave higher than usual.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her, which,\r\ntogether with the \xe2\x80\x9cSaints\xe2\x80\x99 Rest\xe2\x80\x9d and the gruel, may have had some\r\ninfluence in gradually calming her feelings, and making it possible for\r\nher to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time.\r\nThis was, partly, Mr Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that she would do well to let\r\nher five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up; and,\r\nfurther, his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case\r\nof his death. Mr Glegg, like all men of his stamp, was extremely\r\nreticent about his will; and Mrs Glegg, in her gloomier moments, had\r\nforebodings that, like other husbands of whom she had heard, he might\r\ncherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by\r\nleaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she\r\nwould have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more\r\nthan if he had been a second husband. But if he had really shown her\r\nany testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him,\r\npoor man, when he was gone; and even his foolish fuss about the flowers\r\nand garden-stuff, and his insistence on the subject of snails, would be\r\ntouching when it was once fairly at an end. To survive Mr Glegg, and\r\ntalk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses, but\r\nwho had done the right thing by her, not-withstanding his numerous poor\r\nrelations; to have sums of interest coming in more frequently, and\r\nsecrete it in various corners, baffling to the most ingenious of\r\nthieves (for, to Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s mind, banks and strong-boxes would have\r\nnullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her\r\nfood in capsules); finally, to be looked up to by her own family and\r\nthe neighbourhood, so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the\r\npr\xc3\xa6terite and present dignity comprised in being a \xe2\x80\x9cwidow well\r\nleft,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future.\r\nSo that when good Mr Glegg, restored to good humour by much hoeing, and\r\nmoved by the sight of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair, with her knitting rolled\r\nup in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had\r\nbeen tolling for poor Mr Morton, Mrs Glegg answered magnanimously,\r\nquite as if she had been an uninjured woman: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! then, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\ngood business for somebody to take to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaxter had been open at least eight hours by this time, for it was\r\nnearly five o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and if people are to quarrel often, it follows as\r\na corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that\r\nevening. Mr Glegg went the length of admitting that Tulliver was a sad\r\nman for getting into hot water, and was like enough to run through his\r\nproperty; and Mrs Glegg, meeting this acknowledgment half-way, declared\r\nthat it was beneath her to take notice of such a man\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and\r\nthat, for her sister\xe2\x80\x99s sake, she would let him keep the five hundred a\r\nwhile longer, for when she put it out on a mortgage she should only get\r\nfour per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life\r\n\r\nOwing to this new adjustment of Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, Mrs Pullet found\r\nher task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy. Mrs Glegg, indeed\r\nchecked her rather sharply for thinking it would be necessary to tell\r\nher elder sister what was the right mode of behaviour in family\r\nmatters. Mrs Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s argument, that it would look ill in the\r\nneighbourhood if people should have it in their power to say that there\r\nwas a quarrel in the family, was particularly offensive. If the family\r\nname never suffered except through Mrs Glegg, Mrs Pullet might lay her\r\nhead on her pillow in perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not to be expected, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Glegg, by way of\r\nwinding up the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cas I shall go to the mill again before Bessy\r\ncomes to see me, or as I shall go and fall down o\xe2\x80\x99 my knees to Mr\r\nTulliver, and ask his pardon for showing him favours; but I shall bear\r\nno malice, and when Mr Tulliver speaks civil to me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak civil to\r\nhim. Nobody has any call to tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s becoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers, it was natural that\r\naunt Pullet should relax a little in her anxiety for them, and recur to\r\nthe annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that\r\napparently ill-fated house. Mrs Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative,\r\nto which Mr Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable memory furnished some items; and while\r\naunt Pullet pitied poor Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s bad luck with her children, and\r\nexpressed a half-formed project of paying for Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s being sent to a\r\ndistant boarding-school, which would not prevent her being so brown,\r\nbut might tend to subdue some other vices in her, aunt Glegg blamed\r\nBessy for her weakness, and appealed to all witnesses who should be\r\nliving when the Tulliver children had turned out ill, that she, Mrs\r\nGlegg, had always said how it would be from the very first, observing\r\nthat it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I may call and tell Bessy you\xe2\x80\x99ll bear no malice, and everything\r\nbe as it was before?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Pullet said, just before parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may, Sophy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may tell Mr Tulliver, and\r\nBessy too, as I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to behave ill because folks behave ill to\r\nme; I know it\xe2\x80\x99s my place, as the eldest, to set an example in every\r\nrespect, and I do it. Nobody can say different of me, if they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep\r\nto the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty\r\nmagnanimity, I leave you to judge what effect was produced on her by\r\nthe reception of a short letter from Mr Tulliver that very evening,\r\nafter Mrs Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s departure, informing her that she needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble\r\nher mind about her five hundred pounds, for it should be paid back to\r\nher in the course of the next month at farthest, together with the\r\ninterest due thereon until the time of payment. And furthermore, that\r\nMr Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to Mrs Glegg, and she was\r\nwelcome to his house whenever she liked to come, but he desired no\r\nfavours from her, either for himself or his children.\r\n\r\nIt was poor Mrs Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely\r\nthrough that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect\r\nthat similar causes may at any time produce different results. It had\r\nvery often occurred in her experience that Mr Tulliver had done\r\nsomething because other people had said he was not able to do it, or\r\nhad pitied him for his supposed inability, or in any other way piqued\r\nhis pride; still, she thought to-day, if she told him when he came in\r\nto tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything up with\r\nsister Glegg, so that he needn\xe2\x80\x99t think about paying in the money, it\r\nwould give a cheerful effect to the meal. Mr Tulliver had never\r\nslackened in his resolve to raise the money, but now he at once\r\ndetermined to write a letter to Mrs Glegg, which should cut off all\r\npossibility of mistake. Mrs Pullet gone to beg and pray for _him_\r\nindeed! Mr Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, and found the\r\nrelation between spoken and written language, briefly known as\r\nspelling, one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world.\r\nNevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in less time\r\nthan usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94why, she\r\nbelonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter\r\nof private judgment.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter, and cut\r\noff the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her\r\nthousand pounds; for she had her principles. No one must be able to say\r\nof her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with\r\nperfect fairness among her own kin. In the matter of wills, personal\r\nqualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood; and\r\nto be determined in the distribution of your property by caprice, and\r\nnot make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship, was a\r\nprospective disgrace that would have embittered her life. This had\r\nalways been a principle in the Dodson family; it was one form of that\r\nsense of honour and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such\r\nfamilies,\xe2\x80\x94a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nBut though the letter could not shake Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s principles, it made\r\nthe family breach much more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it\r\nproduced on Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of Mr Tulliver, she begged to be\r\nunderstood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say\r\nabout him; his state of mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her to\r\ncontemplate it for a moment. It was not until the evening before Tom\r\nwent to school, at the beginning of August, that Mrs Glegg paid a visit\r\nto her sister Tulliver, sitting in her gig all the while, and showing\r\nher displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism;\r\nfor, as she observed to her sister Deane, \xe2\x80\x9cBessy must bear the\r\nconsequence o\xe2\x80\x99 having such a husband, though I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for her,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMrs Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.\r\n\r\nThat evening Tom observed to Maggie: \xe2\x80\x9cOh my! Maggie, aunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeginning to come again; I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99m going to school. _You\xe2\x80\x99ll_ catch\r\nit all now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s going away\r\nfrom her, that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind, and\r\nshe cried herself to sleep that night.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in\r\nfinding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred\r\npounds on bond. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be no client of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself;\r\nand yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not\r\nbecause Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s will was feeble, but because external fact was\r\nstronger. Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s client was the only convenient person to be found. Mr\r\nTulliver had a destiny as well as \xc5\x92dipus, and in this case he might\r\nplead, like \xc5\x92dipus, that his deed was inflicted on him rather than\r\ncommitted by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL-TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Half\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings during the first quarter he was at King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLorton, under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling, were\r\nrather severe. At Mr Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s academy life had not presented itself to\r\nhim as a difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with,\r\nand Tom being good at all active games,\xe2\x80\x94fighting especially,\xe2\x80\x94had that\r\nprecedence among them which appeared to him inseparable from the\r\npersonality of Tom Tulliver. Mr Jacobs himself, familiarly known as Old\r\nGoggles, from his habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe;\r\nand if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write\r\nlike copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques, to\r\nspell without forethought, and to spout \xe2\x80\x9cmy name is Norval\xe2\x80\x9d without\r\nbungling, Tom, for his part, was glad he was not in danger of those\r\nmean accomplishments. He was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster, he,\r\nbut a substantial man, like his father, who used to go hunting when he\r\nwas younger, and rode a capital black mare,\xe2\x80\x94as pretty a bit of\r\nhorse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her points were a\r\nhundred times. _He_ meant to go hunting too, and to be generally\r\nrespected. When people were grown up, he considered, nobody inquired\r\nabout their writing and spelling; when he was a man, he should be\r\nmaster of everything, and do just as he liked. It had been very\r\ndifficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his school-time\r\nwas to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s business, which he had always thought extremely pleasant; for\r\nit was nothing but riding about, giving orders, and going to market;\r\nand he thought that a clergyman would give him a great many Scripture\r\nlessons, and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a\r\nSunday, as well as the Collect. But in the absence of specific\r\ninformation, it was impossible for him to imagine that school and a\r\nschoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy of\r\nMr Jacobs. So, not to be at a deficiency, in case of his finding genial\r\ncompanions, he had taken care to carry with him a small box of\r\npercussion-caps; not that there was anything particular to be done with\r\nthem, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense of his\r\nfamiliarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he saw very clearly\r\nthrough Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s illusions, was not without illusions of his own, which\r\nwere to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLorton.\r\n\r\nHe had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that\r\nlife, complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new\r\nstandard of English pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made\r\nall the more obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness. Tom, as you have\r\nobserved, was never an exception among boys for ease of address; but\r\nthe difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to Mr or Mrs\r\nStelling was so great, that he even dreaded to be asked at table\r\nwhether he would have more pudding. As to the percussion-caps, he had\r\nalmost resolved, in the bitterness of his heart, that he would throw\r\nthem into a neighbouring pond; for not only was he the solitary pupil,\r\nbut he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a\r\ngeneral sense that his theory of life was undermined. For Mr Stelling\r\nthought nothing of guns, or horses either, apparently; and yet it was\r\nimpossible for Tom to despise Mr Stelling as he had despised Old\r\nGoggles. If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about\r\nMr Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom\xe2\x80\x99s power to detect it; it is only\r\nby a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full-grown man can\r\ndistinguish well-rolled barrels from mere supernal thunder.\r\n\r\nMr Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with\r\nflaxen hair standing erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were\r\nalways very wide open; he had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of\r\ndefiant self-confidence inclining to brazenness. He had entered on his\r\ncareer with great vigor, and intended to make a considerable impression\r\non his fellow-men. The Rev. Walter Stelling was not a man who would\r\nremain among the \xe2\x80\x9cinferior clergy\xe2\x80\x9d all his life. He had a true British\r\ndetermination to push his way in the world,\xe2\x80\x94as a schoolmaster, in the\r\nfirst place, for there were capital masterships of grammar-schools to\r\nbe had, and Mr Stelling meant to have one of them; but as a preacher\r\nalso, for he meant always to preach in a striking manner, so as to have\r\nhis congregation swelled by admirers from neighbouring parishes, and to\r\nproduce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a\r\nbrother clergyman of minor gifts. The style of preaching he had chosen\r\nwas the extemporaneous, which was held little short of the miraculous\r\nin rural parishes like King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and\r\nBourdaloue, which he knew by heart, were really very effective when\r\nrolled out in Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s deepest tones; but as comparatively feeble\r\nappeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive\r\nmanner, they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers. Mr\r\nStelling\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine was of no particular school; if anything, it had a\r\ntinge of evangelicalism, for that was \xe2\x80\x9cthe telling thing\xe2\x80\x9d just then in\r\nthe diocese to which King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton belonged. In short, Mr Stelling was\r\na man who meant to rise in his profession, and to rise by merit,\r\nclearly, since he had no interest beyond what might be promised by a\r\nproblematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become Lord\r\nChancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets\r\na little into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he will\r\nlive in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his\r\nlife; and if the few hundreds Mr Timpson advanced toward his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture,\r\ntogether with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying out of a\r\nsuperior flower-garden, it followed in the most rigorous manner, either\r\nthat these things must be procured by some other means, or else that\r\nthe Rev. Mr Stelling must go without them, which last alternative would\r\nbe an absurd procrastination of the fruits of success, where success\r\nwas certain. Mr Stelling was so broad-chested and resolute that he felt\r\nequal to anything; he would become celebrated by shaking the\r\nconsciences of his hearers, and he would by and by edit a Greek play,\r\nand invent several new readings. He had not yet selected the play, for\r\nhaving been married little more than two years, his leisure time had\r\nbeen much occupied with attentions to Mrs Stelling; but he had told\r\nthat fine woman what he meant to do some day, and she felt great\r\nconfidence in her husband, as a man who understood everything of that\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nBut the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver\r\nduring this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had\r\nbeen some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same\r\nneighbourhood and it might further a decision in Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s favour,\r\nif it were understood that young Tulliver, who, Mr Stelling observed in\r\nconjugal privacy, was rather a rough cub, had made prodigious progress\r\nin a short time. It was on this ground that he was severe with Tom\r\nabout his lessons; he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be\r\ndeveloped through the medium of the Latin grammar, without the\r\napplication of some sternness. Not that Mr Stelling was a\r\nharsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary. He was jocose with\r\nTom at table, and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in\r\nthe most playful manner; but poor Tom was only the more cowed and\r\nconfused by this double novelty, for he had never been used to jokes at\r\nall like Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s; and for the first time in his life he had a\r\npainful sense that he was all wrong somehow. When Mr Stelling said, as\r\nthe roast-beef was being uncovered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tulliver! which would you\r\nrather decline, roast-beef or the Latin for it?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom, to whom in his\r\ncoolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a\r\nstate of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him except the\r\nfeeling that he would rather not have anything to do with Latin; of\r\ncourse he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cRoast-beef,\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon there followed much\r\nlaughter and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom\r\ngathered that he had in some mysterious way refused beef, and, in fact,\r\nmade himself appear \xe2\x80\x9ca silly.\xe2\x80\x9d If he could have seen a fellow-pupil\r\nundergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits, he\r\nmight sooner have taken them as a matter of course. But there are two\r\nexpensive forms of education, either of which a parent may procure for\r\nhis son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman: one is the\r\nenjoyment of the reverend gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s undivided neglect; the other is\r\nthe endurance of the reverend gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s undivided attention. It was\r\nthe latter privilege for which Mr Tulliver paid a high price in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninitiatory months at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton.\r\n\r\nThat respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven\r\nhomeward in a state of great mental satisfaction. He considered that it\r\nwas a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley\xe2\x80\x99s advice\r\nabout a tutor for Tom. Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were so wide open, and he\r\ntalked in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every\r\ndifficult, slow remark of Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s with, \xe2\x80\x9cI see, my good sir, I\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cYou want your son to be a man who will\r\nmake his way in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that Mr Tulliver was delighted to find in\r\nhim a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the everyday\r\naffairs of this life. Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the\r\nlast sessions, Mr Tulliver thought the Rev. Mr Stelling was the\r\nshrewdest fellow he had ever met with,\xe2\x80\x94not unlike Wylde, in fact; he\r\nhad the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat. Mr Tulliver was not by any means an exception in mistaking\r\nbrazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling shrewd, and a\r\nman of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by his clerical\r\nbrethren that he was considered rather a dull fellow. But he told Mr\r\nTulliver several stories about \xe2\x80\x9cSwing\xe2\x80\x9d and incendiarism, and asked his\r\nadvice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a\r\nmanner, with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the miller\r\nthought, here was the very thing he wanted for Tom. He had no doubt\r\nthis first-rate man was acquainted with every branch of information,\r\nand knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a match for the\r\nlawyers, which poor Mr Tulliver himself did _not_ know, and so was\r\nnecessarily thrown for self-direction on this wide kind of inference.\r\nIt is hardly fair to laugh at him, for I have known much more highly\r\ninstructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide, and not at\r\nall wiser.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Tulliver, finding that Mrs Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s views as to the airing\r\nof linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy\r\nentirely coincided with her own; moreover, that Mrs Stelling, though so\r\nyoung a woman, and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone\r\nthrough very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the\r\nbehaviour and fundamental character of the monthly nurse,\xe2\x80\x94she expressed\r\ngreat contentment to her husband, when they drove away, at leaving Tom\r\nwith a woman who, in spite of her youth, seemed quite sensible and\r\nmotherly, and asked advice as prettily as could be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be very well off, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s as nice as can be all over the house, and that watered\r\nsilk she had on cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet has got one like\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s got some income besides the curacy, I\r\nreckon. Perhaps her father allows \xe2\x80\x99em something. There\xe2\x80\x99s Tom \xe2\x80\x99ull be\r\nanother hundred to him, and not much trouble either, by his own\r\naccount; he says teaching comes natural to him. That\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful, now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Mr Tulliver, turning his head on one side, and giving his horse a\r\nmeditative tickling on the flank.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr Stelling, that he\r\nset about it with that uniformity of method and independence of\r\ncircumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be\r\nunder the immediate teaching of nature. Mr Broderip\xe2\x80\x99s amiable beaver,\r\nas that charming naturalist tells us, busied himself as earnestly in\r\nconstructing a dam, in a room up three pair of stairs in London, as if\r\nhe had been laying his foundation in a stream or lake in Upper Canada.\r\nIt was \xe2\x80\x9cBinny\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d function to build; the absence of water or of possible\r\nprogeny was an accident for which he was not accountable. With the same\r\nunerring instinct Mr Stelling set to work at his natural method of\r\ninstilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into the mind of Tom Tulliver.\r\nThis, he considered, was the only basis of solid instruction; all other\r\nmeans of education were mere charlatanism, and could produce nothing\r\nbetter than smatterers. Fixed on this firm basis, a man might observe\r\nthe display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly\r\neducated people with a pitying smile; all that sort of thing was very\r\nwell, but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions. In\r\nholding this conviction Mr Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors\r\nhave been, by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship;\r\nand as to his views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from\r\npersonal partiality. Mr Stelling was very far from being led astray by\r\nenthusiasm, either religious or intellectual; on the other hand, he had\r\nno secret belief that everything was humbug. He thought religion was a\r\nvery excellent thing, and Aristotle a great authority, and deaneries\r\nand prebends useful institutions, and Great Britain the providential\r\nbulwark of Protestantism, and faith in the unseen a great support to\r\nafflicted minds; he believed in all these things, as a Swiss\r\nhotel-keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him, and in\r\nthe pleasure it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way Mr\r\nStelling believed in his method of education; he had no doubt that he\r\nwas doing the very best thing for Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s boy. Of course, when\r\nthe miller talked of \xe2\x80\x9cmapping\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csumming\xe2\x80\x9d in a vague and diffident\r\nmanner, Mr Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he\r\nunderstood what was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could\r\nform any reasonable judgment about the matter? Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s duty was\r\nto teach the lad in the only right way,\xe2\x80\x94indeed he knew no other; he had\r\nnot wasted his time in the acquirement of anything abnormal.\r\n\r\nHe very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though\r\nby hard labour he could get particular declensions into his brain,\r\nanything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations\r\ncould by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to\r\nrecognise a chance genitive or dative. This struck Mr Stelling as\r\nsomething more than natural stupidity; he suspected obstinacy, or at\r\nany rate indifference, and lectured Tom severely on his want of\r\nthorough application. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel no interest in what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr Stelling would say, and the reproach was painfully true. Tom had\r\nnever found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter, when\r\nonce he had been told the distinction, and his perceptive powers were\r\nnot at all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as those of the\r\nRev. Mr Stelling; for Tom could predict with accuracy what number of\r\nhorses were cantering behind him, he could throw a stone right into the\r\ncentre of a given ripple, he could guess to a fraction how many lengths\r\nof his stick it would take to reach across the playground, and could\r\ndraw almost perfect squares on his slate without any measurement. But\r\nMr Stelling took no note of these things; he only observed that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolised to\r\nhim in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and that he was in a state\r\nbordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given\r\ntriangles must be equal, though he could discern with great promptitude\r\nand certainty the fact that they _were_ equal. Whence Mr Stelling\r\nconcluded that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s brain, being peculiarly impervious to etymology\r\nand demonstrations, was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and\r\nharrowed by these patent implements; it was his favourite metaphor,\r\nthat the classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind\r\nwhich prepared it for the reception of any subsequent crop. I say\r\nnothing against Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s theory; if we are to have one regimen for\r\nall minds, his seems to me as good as any other. I only know it turned\r\nout as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied with\r\ncheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from\r\ndigesting it. It is astonishing what a different result one gets by\r\nchanging the metaphor! Once call the brain an intellectual stomach, and\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and\r\nharrows seems to settle nothing. But then it is open to some one else\r\nto follow great authorities, and call the mind a sheet of white paper\r\nor a mirror, in which case one\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the digestive process\r\nbecomes quite irrelevant. It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call\r\nthe camel the ship of the desert, but it would hardly lead one far in\r\ntraining that useful beast. O Aristotle! if you had had the advantage\r\nof being \xe2\x80\x9cthe freshest modern\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the greatest ancient, would\r\nyou not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech, as a sign of\r\nhigh intelligence, with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows\r\nitself in speech without metaphor,\xe2\x80\x94that we can so seldom declare what a\r\nthing is, except by saying it is something else?\r\n\r\nTom Tulliver, being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any\r\nmetaphor to declare his views as to the nature of Latin; he never\r\ncalled it an instrument of torture; and it was not until he had got on\r\nsome way in the next half-year, and in the Delectus, that he was\r\nadvanced enough to call it a \xe2\x80\x9cbore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeastly stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d At present, in\r\nrelation to this demand that he should learn Latin declensions and\r\nconjugations, Tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness\r\nconcerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings, as if he had been\r\nan innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk of an ash-tree in\r\norder to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless almost incredible to\r\ninstructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve, not belonging\r\nstrictly to \xe2\x80\x9cthe masses,\xe2\x80\x9d who are now understood to have the monopoly\r\nof mental darkness, should have had no distinct idea how there came to\r\nbe such a thing as Latin on this earth; yet so it was with Tom. It\r\nwould have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there\r\never existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen, and\r\ntransacted the everyday affairs of life, through the medium of this\r\nlanguage; and still longer to make him understand why he should be\r\ncalled upon to learn it, when its connection with those affairs had\r\nbecome entirely latent. So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with\r\nthe Romans at Mr Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s academy, his knowledge was strictly correct,\r\nbut it went no farther than the fact that they were \xe2\x80\x9cin the New\r\nTestament\xe2\x80\x9d; and Mr Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and emasculate\r\nhis pupil\xe2\x80\x99s mind by simplifying and explaining, or to reduce the tonic\r\neffect of etymology by mixing it with smattering, extraneous\r\ninformation, such as is given to girls.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like\r\na girl than he had ever been in his life before. He had a large share\r\nof pride, which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the\r\nworld, despising Old Goggles, and reposing in the sense of unquestioned\r\nrights; but now this same pride met with nothing but bruises and\r\ncrushings. Tom was too clear-sighted not to be aware that Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstandard of things was quite different, was certainly something higher\r\nin the eyes of the world than that of the people he had been living\r\namongst, and that, brought in contact with it, he, Tom Tulliver,\r\nappeared uncouth and stupid; he was by no means indifferent to this,\r\nand his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his\r\nboyish self-satisfaction, and gave him something of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsusceptibility. He was of a very firm, not to say obstinate, disposition,\r\nbut there was no brute-like rebellion and recklessness in his nature;\r\nthe human sensibilities predominated, and if it had occurred to him\r\nthat he could enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons, and\r\nso acquire Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s approbation, by standing on one leg for an\r\ninconvenient length of time, or rapping his head moderately against the\r\nwall, or any voluntary action of that sort, he would certainly have\r\ntried it. But no; Tom had never heard that these measures would\r\nbrighten the understanding, or strengthen the verbal memory; and he was\r\nnot given to hypothesis and experiment. It did occur to him that he\r\ncould perhaps get some help by praying for it; but as the prayers he\r\nsaid every evening were forms learned by heart, he rather shrank from\r\nthe novelty and irregularity of introducing an extempore passage on a\r\ntopic of petition for which he was not aware of any precedent. But one\r\nday, when he had broken down, for the fifth time, in the supines of the\r\nthird conjugation, and Mr Stelling, convinced that this must be\r\ncarelessness, since it transcended the bounds of possible stupidity,\r\nhad lectured him very seriously, pointing out that if he failed to\r\nseize the present golden opportunity of learning supines, he would have\r\nto regret it when he became a man,\xe2\x80\x94Tom, more miserable than usual,\r\ndetermined to try his sole resource; and that evening, after his usual\r\nform of prayer for his parents and \xe2\x80\x9clittle sister\xe2\x80\x9d (he had begun to\r\npray for Maggie when she was a baby), and that he might be able always\r\nto keep God\xe2\x80\x99s commandments, he added, in the same low whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nplease to make me always remember my Latin.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a little to\r\nconsider how he should pray about Euclid\xe2\x80\x94whether he should ask to see\r\nwhat it meant, or whether there was any other mental state which would\r\nbe more applicable to the case. But at last he added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd make Mr\r\nStelling say I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t do Euclid any more. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day,\r\nencouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers, and\r\nneutralised any scepticism that might have arisen from Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontinued demand for Euclid. But his faith broke down under the\r\napparent absence of all help when he got into the irregular verbs. It\r\nseemed clear that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s despair under the caprices of the present tense\r\ndid not constitute a _nodus_ worthy of interference, and since this was\r\nthe climax of his difficulties, where was the use of praying for help\r\nany longer? He made up his mind to this conclusion in one of his dull,\r\nlonely evenings, which he spent in the study, preparing his lessons for\r\nthe morrow. His eyes were apt to get dim over the page, though he hated\r\ncrying, and was ashamed of it; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking with some\r\naffection even of Spouncer, whom he used to fight and quarrel with; he\r\nwould have felt at home with Spouncer, and in a condition of\r\nsuperiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap pricking up his\r\nears, ready to obey the least sign when Tom said, \xe2\x80\x9cHoigh!\xe2\x80\x9d would all\r\ncome before him in a sort of calenture, when his fingers played\r\nabsently in his pocket with his great knife and his coil of whipcord,\r\nand other relics of the past.\r\n\r\nTom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his life before,\r\nand at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed\r\nby a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him\r\nout of school hours. Mrs Stelling had lately had her second baby, and\r\nas nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself\r\nuseful, Mrs Stelling considered she was doing Tom a service by setting\r\nhim to watch the little cherub Laura while the nurse was occupied with\r\nthe sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment for Tom to take\r\nlittle Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day; it would help\r\nto make him feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for him, and that he\r\nwas one of the family. The little cherub Laura, not being an\r\naccomplished walker at present, had a ribbon fastened round her waist,\r\nby which Tom held her as if she had been a little dog during the\r\nminutes in which she chose to walk; but as these were rare, he was for\r\nthe most part carrying this fine child round and round the garden,\r\nwithin sight of Mrs Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s window, according to orders. If any one\r\nconsiders this unfair and even oppressive toward Tom, I beg him to\r\nconsider that there are feminine virtues which are with difficulty\r\ncombined, even if they are not incompatible. When the wife of a poor\r\ncurate contrives, under all her disadvantages, to dress extremely well,\r\nand to have a style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall\r\noccasionally officiate as lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid; when, moreover, her\r\ndinner-parties and her drawing-room show that effort at elegance and\r\ncompleteness of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine a\r\nlarge income necessary, it would be unreasonable to expect of her that\r\nshe should employ a second nurse, or even act as a nurse herself. Mr\r\nStelling knew better; he saw that his wife did wonders already, and was\r\nproud of her. It was certainly not the best thing in the world for\r\nyoung Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s gait to carry a heavy child, but he had plenty of\r\nexercise in long walks with himself, and next half-year Mr Stelling\r\nwould see about having a drilling-master. Among the many means whereby\r\nMr Stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his\r\nfellow-men, he had entirely given up that of having his own way in his\r\nown house. What then? He had married \xe2\x80\x9cas kind a little soul as ever\r\nbreathed,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Mr Riley, who had been acquainted with Mrs\r\nStelling\xe2\x80\x99s blond ringlets and smiling demeanour throughout her maiden\r\nlife, and on the strength of that knowledge would have been ready any\r\nday to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in her\r\nmarried life must be entirely Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\r\n\r\nIf Tom had had a worse disposition, he would certainly have hated the\r\nlittle cherub Laura, but he was too kind-hearted a lad for that; there\r\nwas too much in him of the fibre that turns to true manliness, and to\r\nprotecting pity for the weak. I am afraid he hated Mrs Stelling, and\r\ncontracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits,\r\nas directly associated with haughtiness of manner, and a frequent\r\nreference to other people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cduty.\xe2\x80\x9d But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help playing with\r\nlittle Laura, and liking to amuse her; he even sacrificed his\r\npercussion-caps for her sake, in despair of their ever serving a\r\ngreater purpose,\xe2\x80\x94thinking the small flash and bang would delight her,\r\nand thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs Stelling for\r\nteaching her child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of\r\nplayfellow\xe2\x80\x94and oh, how Tom longed for playfellows! In his secret heart\r\nhe yearned to have Maggie with him, and was almost ready to dote on her\r\nexasperating acts of forgetfulness; though, when he was at home, he\r\nalways represented it as a great favour on his part to let Maggie trot\r\nby his side on his pleasure excursions.\r\n\r\nAnd before this dreary half-year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs\r\nStelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and\r\nstay with her brother; so when Mr Tulliver drove over to King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton\r\nlate in October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she was taking a\r\ngreat journey, and beginning to see the world. It was Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst visit to see Tom, for the lad must learn not to think too much\r\nabout home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Tom, when Mr Stelling had left the room to\r\nannounce the arrival to his wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom\r\nfreely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look rarely! School agrees with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom wished he had looked rather ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I _am_ well, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d ask Mr\r\nStelling not to let me do Euclid; it brings on the toothache, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEuclid, my lad,\xe2\x80\x94why, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; it\xe2\x80\x99s definitions, and axioms, and triangles, and\r\nthings. It\xe2\x80\x99s a book I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to learn in\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, reprovingly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say so. You must\r\nlearn what your master tells you. He knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s right for you to\r\nlearn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ help you now, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with a little air of\r\npatronizing consolation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come to stay ever so long, if Mrs\r\nStelling asks me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought my box and my pinafores, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I,\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ help me, you silly little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in such high spirits\r\nat this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding\r\nMaggie by showing her a page of Euclid. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see you doing\r\none of _my_ lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such\r\nthings. They\xe2\x80\x99re too silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what Latin is very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cLatin\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlanguage. There are Latin words in the Dictionary. There\xe2\x80\x99s bonus, a\r\ngift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you\xe2\x80\x99re just wrong there, Miss Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, secretly\r\nastonished. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you\xe2\x80\x99re very wise! But \xe2\x80\x98bonus\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98good,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nit happens,\xe2\x80\x94bonus, bona, bonum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x98gift,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nstoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may mean several things; almost every word does. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lawn,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff pocket\r\nhandkerchiefs are made of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, little \xe2\x80\x99un,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt\r\nrather disgusted with Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s knowingness, though beyond measure\r\ncheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him. Her\r\nconceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.\r\n\r\nMrs Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time\r\nthan a week for Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s stay; but Mr Stelling, who took her between\r\nhis knees, and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted\r\nthat she must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr Stelling was a\r\ncharming man, and Mr Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench\r\nwhere she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to\r\nappreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she should not be fetched\r\nhome till the end of the fortnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, come with me into the study, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, as their\r\nfather drove away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you shake and toss your head now for, you\r\nsilly?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; for though her hair was now under a new\r\ndispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed\r\nstill in imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes you\r\nlook as if you were crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tease me, Tom.\r\nOh, what books!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, as she saw the bookcases in the study.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I should like to have as many books as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read one of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall Latin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI can read the back of this,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98History\r\nof the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what does that mean? _You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, wagging his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I could soon find out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should look inside, and see what it was about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better not, Miss Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, seeing her hand on the\r\nvolume. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave, and _I_\r\nshall catch it, if you take it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. Let me see all _your_ books, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nturning to throw her arms round Tom\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and rub his cheek with her\r\nsmall round nose.\r\n\r\nTom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute\r\nwith and crow over again, seized her round the waist, and began to jump\r\nwith her round the large library table. Away they jumped with more and\r\nmore vigor, till Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s hair flew from behind her ears, and twirled\r\nabout like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became\r\nmore and more irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr\r\nStelling\xe2\x80\x99s reading stand, they sent it thundering down with its heavy\r\nlexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study\r\nwas a one-storied wing to the house, so that the downfall made no\r\nalarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few\r\nminutes, dreading the appearance of Mr or Mrs Stelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must\r\nkeep quiet here, you know. If we break anything Mrs Stelling\xe2\x80\x99ll make us\r\ncry peccavi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Latin for a good scolding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, not without some\r\npride in his knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she a cross woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with an emphatic nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think all women are crosser than men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngreat deal crosser than uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than\r\nfather does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you\xe2\x80\x99ll_ be a woman some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cso _you_ needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall be a _clever_ woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with a toss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99ll hate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to hate me, Tom; it\xe2\x80\x99ll be very wicked of you, for I\r\nshall be your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re a nasty disagreeable thing I _shall_ hate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, Tom, you won\xe2\x80\x99t! I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be disagreeable. I shall be very\r\ngood to you, and I shall be good to everybody. You won\xe2\x80\x99t hate me\r\nreally, will you, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother! never mind! Come, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to learn my lessons.\r\nSee here! what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him and\r\nshowing her his theorem, while she pushed her hair behind her ears, and\r\nprepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She\r\nbegan to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently,\r\nbecoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was\r\nunavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand very ugly stuff; nobody need want to\r\nmake it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there, now, Miss Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, drawing the book away, and\r\nwagging his head at her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see you\xe2\x80\x99re not so clever as you thought\r\nyou were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, pouting, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I could make it out, if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlearned what goes before, as you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s what you just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Miss Wisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cFor it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall the harder when you know what goes before; for then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nsay what definition 3 is, and what axiom V. is. But get along with you\r\nnow; I must go on with this. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the Latin Grammar. See what you can\r\nmake of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical\r\nmortification; for she delighted in new words, and quickly found that\r\nthere was an English Key at the end, which would make her very wise\r\nabout Latin, at slight expense. She presently made up her mind to skip\r\nthe rules in the Syntax, the examples became so absorbing. These\r\nmysterious sentences, snatched from an unknown context,\xe2\x80\x94like strange\r\nhorns of beasts, and leaves of unknown plants, brought from some\r\nfar-off region,\xe2\x80\x94gave boundless scope to her imagination, and were all\r\nthe more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their\r\nown, which she could learn to interpret. It was really very\r\ninteresting, the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn;\r\nand she was proud because she found it interesting. The most\r\nfragmentary examples were her favourites. _Mors omnibus est communis_\r\nwould have been jejune, only she liked to know the Latin; but the\r\nfortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had a son\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cendowed with _such_ a disposition\xe2\x80\x9d afforded her a great deal of\r\npleasant conjecture, and she was quite lost in the \xe2\x80\x9cthick grove\r\npenetrable by no star,\xe2\x80\x9d when Tom called out,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a pretty book!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she jumped out of the\r\nlarge arm-chair to give it him; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s much prettier than the\r\nDictionary. I could learn Latin very soon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s at all\r\nhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading the\r\nEnglish at the end. Any donkey can do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like\r\nair, as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys\r\nwould find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the\r\nbookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom called to her: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Magsie, come and hear if I can say\r\nthis. Stand at that end of the table, where Mr Stelling sits when he\r\nhears me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie obeyed, and took the open book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you begin, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I begin at _\xe2\x80\x99Appellativa arborum,\xe2\x80\x99_ because I say all over again\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve been learning this week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning\r\nto forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what _mas_ could\r\nmean, which came twice over, when he stuck fast at _Sunt etiam\r\nvolucrum_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, Maggie; _Sunt etiam volucrum_\xe2\x80\x94_Sunt etiam volucrum_\xe2\x80\x94_ut\r\nostrea, cetus_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, opening her mouth and shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sunt etiam volucrum_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, very slowly, as if the next words\r\nmight be expected to come sooner when he gave them this strong hint\r\nthat they were waited for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC, e, u,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know\xe2\x80\x94hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ceu passer, hirundo;\r\nFerarum_\xe2\x80\x94_ferarum_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Tom took his pencil and made several hard dots\r\nwith it on his book-cover\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_ferarum_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a time you are! _Ut_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ut ostrea_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9c_ut tigris_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, now I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cit was _tigris, vulpes_, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nforgotten: _ut tigris, volupes; et Piscium_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next\r\nfew lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe next is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just learned for\r\nto-morrow. Give me hold of the book a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his fist on\r\nthe table, Tom returned the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mascula nomina in a_,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come next. It\xe2\x80\x99s _Nomen non\r\ncreskens genittivo_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Creskens genittivo!_\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh, for Tom\r\nhad learned this omitted passage for his yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s lesson, and a\r\nyoung gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance\r\nwith Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false\r\nquantity. \xe2\x80\x9c_Creskens genittivo!_ What a little silly you are, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, Tom, for you didn\xe2\x80\x99t remember it at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure it\xe2\x80\x99s spelt so; how was I to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn\xe2\x80\x99t learn Latin. It\xe2\x80\x99s _Nomen non\r\ncrescens genitivo_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, pouting. \xe2\x80\x9cI can say that as well as you\r\ncan. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your stops. For you ought to stop twice as long\r\nat a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you make the longest stops\r\nwhere there ought to be no stop at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, don\xe2\x80\x99t chatter. Let me go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the\r\ndrawing-room, and Maggie became so animated with Mr Stelling, who, she\r\nfelt sure, admired her cleverness, that Tom was rather amazed and\r\nalarmed at her audacity. But she was suddenly subdued by Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalluding to a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away\r\nto the gypsies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very odd little girl that must be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Stelling, meaning\r\nto be playful; but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was\r\nnot at all to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s taste. She feared that Mr Stelling, after all,\r\ndid not think much of her, and went to bed in rather low spirits. Mrs\r\nStelling, she felt, looked at her as if she thought her hair was very\r\nugly because it hung down straight behind.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to\r\nTom. She was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons, and\r\nin her various readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin\r\nGrammar. The astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much\r\npuzzling speculation that she one day asked Mr Stelling if all\r\nastronomers hated women, or whether it was only this particular\r\nastronomer. But forestalling his answer, she said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s all astronomers; because, you know, they live up in\r\nhigh towers, and if the women came there they might talk and hinder\r\nthem from looking at the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Stelling liked her prattle immensely, and they were on the best\r\nterms. She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr Stelling, as\r\nhe did, and learn just the same things. She knew she could do Euclid,\r\nfor she had looked into it again, and she saw what A B C meant; they\r\nwere the names of the lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask Mr\r\nStelling if you could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little conceited minx, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Stelling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, that same evening when they were in the\r\ndrawing-room, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I do Euclid, and all Tom\xe2\x80\x99s lessons, if you were\r\nto teach me instead of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls can\xe2\x80\x99t do Euclid; can\r\nthey, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can pick up a little of everything, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nStelling. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve a great deal of superficial cleverness; but they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go far into anything. They\xe2\x80\x99re quick and shallow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his triumph by wagging\r\nhis head at Maggie, behind Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s chair. As for Maggie, she had\r\nhardly ever been so mortified. She had been so proud to be called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquick\xe2\x80\x9d all her little life, and now it appeared that this quickness\r\nwas the brand of inferiority. It would have been better to be slow,\r\nlike Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha! Miss Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when they were alone; \xe2\x80\x9cyou see it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot such a fine thing to be quick. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never go far into anything,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no\r\nspirit for a retort.\r\n\r\nBut when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in\r\nthe gig by Luke, and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he\r\nmissed her grievously. He had really been brighter, and had got through\r\nhis lessons better, since she had been there; and she had asked Mr\r\nStelling so many questions about the Roman Empire, and whether there\r\nreally ever was a man who said, in Latin, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not buy it for a\r\nfarthing or a rotten nut,\xe2\x80\x9d or whether that had only been turned into\r\nLatin, that Tom had actually come to a dim understanding of the fact\r\nthat there had once been people upon the earth who were so fortunate as\r\nto know Latin without learning it through the medium of the Eton\r\nGrammar. This luminous idea was a great addition to his historical\r\nacquirements during this half-year, which were otherwise confined to an\r\nepitomised history of the Jews.\r\n\r\nBut the dreary half-year _did_ come to an end. How glad Tom was to see\r\nthe last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind! The dark\r\nafternoons and the first December snow seemed to him far livelier than\r\nthe August sunshine; and that he might make himself the surer about the\r\nflight of the days that were carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one\r\nsticks deep in a corner of the garden, when he was three weeks from the\r\nholidays, and pulled one up every day with a great wrench, throwing it\r\nto a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it to\r\nlimbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far.\r\n\r\nBut it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin\r\nGrammar, the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at\r\nhome, as the gig passed noiselessly over the snow-covered bridge; the\r\nhappiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and\r\nthe smiles of that familiar hearth, where the pattern of the rug and\r\nthe grate and the fire-irons were \xe2\x80\x9cfirst ideas\xe2\x80\x9d that it was no more\r\npossible to criticise than the solidity and extension of matter. There\r\nis no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where we were\r\nborn, where objects became dear to us before we had known the labour of\r\nchoice, and where the outer world seemed only an extension of our own\r\npersonality; we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own sense of\r\nexistence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly, that\r\nfurniture of our early home might look if it were put up to auction; an\r\nimproved taste in upholstery scorns it; and is not the striving after\r\nsomething better and better in our surroundings the grand\r\ncharacteristic that distinguishes man from the brute, or, to satisfy a\r\nscrupulous accuracy of definition, that distinguishes the British man\r\nfrom the foreign brute? But heaven knows where that striving might lead\r\nus, if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old\r\ninferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep\r\nimmovable roots in memory. One\xe2\x80\x99s delight in an elderberry bush\r\noverhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank, as a more\r\ngladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on\r\nthe softest undulating turf, is an entirely unjustifiable preference to\r\na nursery-gardener, or to any of those regulated minds who are free\r\nfrom the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on a\r\ndemonstrable superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason\r\nfor preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory;\r\nthat it is no novelty in my life, speaking to me merely through my\r\npresent sensibilities to form and colour, but the long companion of my\r\nexistence, that wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas Holidays\r\n\r\nFine old Christmas, with the snowy hair and ruddy face, had done his\r\nduty that year in the noblest fashion, and had set off his rich gifts\r\nof warmth and colour with all the heightening contrast of frost and\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nSnow lay on the croft and river-bank in undulations softer than the\r\nlimbs of infancy; it lay with the neatliest finished border on every\r\nsloping roof, making the dark-red gables stand out with a new depth of\r\ncolour; it weighed heavily on the laurels and fir-trees, till it fell\r\nfrom them with a shuddering sound; it clothed the rough turnip-field\r\nwith whiteness, and made the sheep look like dark blotches; the gates\r\nwere all blocked up with the sloping drifts, and here and there a\r\ndisregarded four-footed beast stood as if petrified \xe2\x80\x9cin unrecumbent\r\nsadness\xe2\x80\x9d; there was no gleam, no shadow, for the heavens, too, were one\r\nstill, pale cloud; no sound or motion in anything but the dark river\r\nthat flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow. But old Christmas\r\nsmiled as he laid this cruel-seeming spell on the outdoor world, for he\r\nmeant to light up home with new brightness, to deepen all the richness\r\nof indoor colour, and give a keener edge of delight to the warm\r\nfragrance of food; he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment that would\r\nstrengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred, and make the sunshine\r\nof familiar human faces as welcome as the hidden day-star. His kindness\r\nfell but hardly on the homeless,\xe2\x80\x94fell but hardly on the homes where the\r\nhearth was not very warm, and where the food had little fragrance;\r\nwhere the human faces had had no sunshine in them, but rather the\r\nleaden, blank-eyed gaze of unexpectant want. But the fine old season\r\nmeant well; and if he has not learned the secret how to bless men\r\nimpartially, it is because his father Time, with ever-unrelenting\r\npurpose, still hides that secret in his own mighty, slow-beating heart.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this Christmas day, in spite of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s fresh delight in home,\r\nwas not, he thought, somehow or other, quite so happy as it had always\r\nbeen before. The red berries were just as abundant on the holly, and he\r\nand Maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and\r\npicture-frames on Christmas eve with as much taste as ever, wedding the\r\nthick-set scarlet clusters with branches of the black-berried ivy.\r\nThere had been singing under the windows after midnight,\xe2\x80\x94supernatural\r\nsinging, Maggie always felt, in spite of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s contemptuous insistence\r\nthat the singers were old Patch, the parish clerk, and the rest of the\r\nchurch choir; she trembled with awe when their carolling broke in upon\r\nher dreams, and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust\r\naway by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud. The midnight\r\nchant had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of common\r\ndays; and then there were the smell of hot toast and ale from the\r\nkitchen, at the breakfast hour; the favourite anthem, the green boughs,\r\nand the short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to the\r\nchurch-going; and aunt and uncle Moss, with all their seven children,\r\nwere looking like so many reflectors of the bright parlour-fire, when\r\nthe church-goers came back, stamping the snow from their feet. The\r\nplum-pudding was of the same handsome roundness as ever, and came in\r\nwith the symbolic blue flames around it, as if it had been heroically\r\nsnatched from the nether fires, into which it had been thrown by\r\ndyspeptic Puritans; the dessert was as splendid as ever, with its\r\ngolden oranges, brown nuts, and the crystalline light and dark of\r\napple-jelly and damson cheese; in all these things Christmas was as it\r\nhad always been since Tom could remember; it was only distinguished, if\r\nby anything, by superior sliding and snowballs.\r\n\r\nChristmas was cheery, but not so Mr Tulliver. He was irate and defiant;\r\nand Tom, though he espoused his father\xe2\x80\x99s quarrels and shared his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s sense of injury, was not without some of the feeling that\r\noppressed Maggie when Mr Tulliver got louder and more angry in\r\nnarration and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert. The\r\nattention that Tom might have concentrated on his nuts and wine was\r\ndistracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world,\r\nand that the business of grown-up life could hardly be conducted\r\nwithout a good deal of quarrelling. Now, Tom was not fond of\r\nquarrelling, unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand-up\r\nfight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing; and his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s irritable talk made him uncomfortable, though he never\r\naccounted to himself for the feeling, or conceived the notion that his\r\nfather was faulty in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s determined resistance was Mr Pivart, who, having lands\r\nhigher up the Ripple, was taking measures for their irrigation, which\r\neither were, or would be, or were bound to be (on the principle that\r\nwater was water), an infringement on Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate share of\r\nwater-power. Dix, who had a mill on the stream, was a feeble auxiliary\r\nof Old Harry compared with Pivart. Dix had been brought to his senses\r\nby arbitration, and Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s advice had not carried _him_ far. No; Dix,\r\nMr Tulliver considered, had been as good as nowhere in point of law;\r\nand in the intensity of his indignation against Pivart, his contempt\r\nfor a baffled adversary like Dix began to wear the air of a friendly\r\nattachment. He had no male audience to-day except Mr Moss, who knew\r\nnothing, as he said, of the \xe2\x80\x9cnatur\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 mills,\xe2\x80\x9d and could only assent to\r\nMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s arguments on the _a priori_ ground of family relationship\r\nand monetary obligation; but Mr Tulliver did not talk with the futile\r\nintention of convincing his audience, he talked to relieve himself;\r\nwhile good Mr Moss made strong efforts to keep his eyes wide open, in\r\nspite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner produced in his\r\nhard-worked frame. Mrs Moss, more alive to the subject, and interested\r\nin everything that affected her brother, listened and put in a word as\r\noften as maternal preoccupations allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Pivart\xe2\x80\x99s a new name hereabout, brother, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t own the land in father\xe2\x80\x99s time, nor yours either, before I was\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew name? Yes, I should think it _is_ a new name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver,\r\nwith angry emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cDorlcote Mill\xe2\x80\x99s been in our family a hundred year\r\nand better, and nobody ever heard of a Pivart meddling with the river,\r\ntill this fellow came and bought Bincome\xe2\x80\x99s farm out of hand, before\r\nanybody else could so much as say \xe2\x80\x98snap.\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll _Pivart_ him!\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nMr Tulliver, lifting his glass with a sense that he had defined his\r\nresolution in an unmistakable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nMoss, with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall be forced to; but I know what I shall force\r\n_him_ to, with his dikes and erigations, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any law to be\r\nbrought to bear o\xe2\x80\x99 the right side. I know well enough who\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\nbottom of it; he\xe2\x80\x99s got Wakem to back him and egg him on. I know Wakem\r\ntells him the law can\xe2\x80\x99t touch him for it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s folks can handle\r\nthe law besides Wakem. It takes a big raskil to beat him; but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbigger to be found, as know more o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 ins and outs o\xe2\x80\x99 the law, else\r\nhow came Wakem to lose Brumley\xe2\x80\x99s suit for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but\r\nhe considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by\r\nemploying a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker. Law was a sort of\r\ncock-fight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a\r\ngame bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGore\xe2\x80\x99s no fool; you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed presently, in a\r\npugnacious tone, as if poor Gritty had been urging that lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapabilities; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, you see, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t up to the law as Wakem is. And\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s a very particular thing; you can\xe2\x80\x99t pick it up with a pitchfork.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s been nuts to Old Harry and the lawyers. It\xe2\x80\x99s plain\r\nenough what\xe2\x80\x99s the rights and the wrongs of water, if you look at it\r\nstraight-forrard; for a river\xe2\x80\x99s a river, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a mill, you\r\nmust have water to turn it; and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use telling me Pivart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nerigation and nonsense won\xe2\x80\x99t stop my wheel; I know what belongs to\r\nwater better than that. Talk to me o\xe2\x80\x99 what th\xe2\x80\x99 engineers say! I say\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s common sense, as Pivart\xe2\x80\x99s dikes must do me an injury. But if\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s their engineering, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put Tom to it by-and-by, and he shall\r\nsee if he can\xe2\x80\x99t find a bit more sense in th\xe2\x80\x99 engineering business than\r\nwhat _that_ comes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his\r\nprospects, unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he was amusing baby\r\nMoss with, whereupon she, being a baby that knew her own mind with\r\nremarkable clearness, instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a\r\npiercing yell, and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of\r\nthe rattle, feeling apparently that the original wrong of having it\r\ntaken from her remained in all its force. Mrs Moss hurried away with\r\nher into another room, and expressed to Mrs Tulliver, who accompanied\r\nher, the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for crying;\r\nimplying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored\r\nfor, she was a misunderstood baby. The thoroughly justifiable yell\r\nbeing quieted, Mrs Moss looked at her sister-in-law and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see brother so put out about this water work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your brother\xe2\x80\x99s way, Mrs Moss; I\xe2\x80\x99d never anything o\xe2\x80\x99 that sort\r\nbefore I was married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, with a half-implied reproach.\r\nShe always spoke of her husband as \xe2\x80\x9cyour brother\xe2\x80\x9d to Mrs Moss in any\r\ncase when his line of conduct was not matter of pure admiration.\r\nAmiable Mrs Tulliver, who was never angry in her life, had yet her mild\r\nshare of that spirit without which she could hardly have been at once a\r\nDodson and a woman. Being always on the defensive toward her own\r\nsisters, it was natural that she should be keenly conscious of her\r\nsuperiority, even as the weakest Dodson, over a husband\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who,\r\nbesides being poorly off, and inclined to \xe2\x80\x9chang on\xe2\x80\x9d her brother, had\r\nthe good-natured submissiveness of a large, easy-tempered, untidy,\r\nprolific woman, with affection enough in her not only for her own\r\nhusband and abundant children, but for any number of collateral\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope and pray he won\xe2\x80\x99t go to law,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nany knowing where that\xe2\x80\x99ll end. And the right doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allays win. This\r\nMr Pivart\xe2\x80\x99s a rich man, by what I can make out, and the rich mostly get\r\nthings their own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, stroking her dress down, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nwhat riches are in my own family; for my sisters have got husbands as\r\ncan afford to do pretty much what they like. But I think sometimes I\r\nshall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation;\r\nand my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is\r\nto marry a man like your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has\r\nher own way from morning till night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should like my husband if he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t got any wits of his own, and I had to find head-piece for him.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a deal easier to do what pleases one\xe2\x80\x99s husband, than to be\r\npuzzling what else one should do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf people come to talk o\xe2\x80\x99 doing what pleases their husbands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, with a faint imitation of her sister Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure your\r\nbrother might have waited a long while before he\xe2\x80\x99d have found a wife\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99ud have let him have his say in everything, as I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nbut law and erigation now, from when we first get up in the morning\r\ntill we go to bed at night; and I never contradict him; I only say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr Tulliver, do as you like; but whativer you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t go to\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver, as we have seen, was not without influence over her\r\nhusband. No woman is; she can always incline him to do either what she\r\nwishes, or the reverse; and on the composite impulses that were\r\nthreatening to hurry Mr Tulliver into \xe2\x80\x9claw,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s monotonous\r\npleading had doubtless its share of force; it might even be comparable\r\nto that proverbial feather which has the credit or discredit of\r\nbreaking the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back; though, on a strictly impartial view, the\r\nblame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which\r\nhad already placed the back in such imminent peril that an otherwise\r\ninnocent feather could not settle on it without mischief. Not that Mrs\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s feeble beseeching could have had this feather\xe2\x80\x99s weight in\r\nvirtue of her single personality; but whenever she departed from entire\r\nassent to her husband, he saw in her the representative of the Dodson\r\nfamily; and it was a guiding principle with Mr Tulliver to let the\r\nDodsons know that they were not to domineer over _him_, or\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nspecifically\xe2\x80\x94that a male Tulliver was far more than equal to four\r\nfemale Dodsons, even though one of them was Mrs Glegg.\r\n\r\nBut not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself\r\nagainst his going to law could have heightened his disposition toward\r\nit so much as the mere thought of Wakem, continually freshened by the\r\nsight of the too able attorney on market-days. Wakem, to his certain\r\nknowledge, was (metaphorically speaking) at the bottom of Pivart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nirrigation; Wakem had tried to make Dix stand out, and go to law about\r\nthe dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had caused Mr Tulliver to lose\r\nthe suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a\r\nthoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an\r\nopportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man\r\nalong the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in\r\nopposition to that form of right embodied in Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s interests\r\nand opinions. And as an extra touch of bitterness, the injured miller\r\nhad recently, in borrowing the five hundred pounds, been obliged to\r\ncarry a little business to Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s office on his own account. A\r\nhook-nosed glib fellow! as cool as a cucumber,\xe2\x80\x94always looking so sure\r\nof his game! And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was not more like\r\nhim, but was a bald, round-featured man, with bland manners and fat\r\nhands; a game-cock that you would be rash to bet upon against Wakem.\r\nGore was a sly fellow. His weakness did not lie on the side of\r\nscrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however significant,\r\nis not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and confident as Mr\r\nTulliver was in his principle that water was water, and in the direct\r\ninference that Pivart had not a leg to stand on in this affair of\r\nirrigation, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Wakem had more law\r\nto show against this (rationally) irrefragable inference than Gore\r\ncould show for it. But then, if they went to law, there was a chance\r\nfor Mr Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his side, instead of\r\nhaving that admirable bully against him; and the prospect of seeing a\r\nwitness of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s made to perspire and become confounded, as Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s witness had once been, was alluring to the love of\r\nretributive justice.\r\n\r\nMuch rumination had Mr Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his\r\nrides on the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side, as\r\nthe scales dipped alternately; but the probable result was still out of\r\nsight, only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in\r\ndomestic and social life. That initial stage of the dispute which\r\nconsisted in the narration of the case and the enforcement of Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s views concerning it throughout the entire circle of his\r\nconnections would necessarily take time; and at the beginning of\r\nFebruary, when Tom was going to school again, there were scarcely any\r\nnew items to be detected in his father\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the case against\r\nPivart, or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on\r\ntaking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was\r\nwater. Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of\r\nprogress, and Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s heat was certainly more and more palpable.\r\nIf there had been no new evidence on any other point, there had been\r\nnew evidence that Pivart was as \xe2\x80\x9cthick as mud\xe2\x80\x9d with Wakem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, one evening near the end of the holidays, \xe2\x80\x9cuncle\r\nGlegg says Lawyer Wakem _is_ going to send his son to Mr Stelling. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t true, what they said about his going to be sent to France. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t like me to go to school with Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s son, shall you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no matter for that, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you learn\r\nanything bad of him, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. The lad\xe2\x80\x99s a poor deformed creatur, and\r\ntakes after his mother in the face; I think there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of his\r\nfather in him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sign Wakem thinks high o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sterling, as he\r\nsends his son to him, and Wakem knows meal from bran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was\r\nto have the same advantages as Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s; but Tom was not at all easy on\r\nthe point. It would have been much clearer if the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s son had not\r\nbeen deformed, for then Tom would have had the prospect of pitching\r\ninto him with all that freedom which is derived from a high moral\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nThe New Schoolfellow\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, wet January day on which Tom went back to school; a day\r\nquite in keeping with this severe phase of his destiny. If he had not\r\ncarried in his pocket a parcel of sugar-candy and a small Dutch doll\r\nfor little Laura, there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to\r\nenliven the general gloom. But he liked to think how Laura would put\r\nout her lips and her tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy; and to give\r\nthe greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination, he took out the\r\nparcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit off a crystal or two,\r\nwhich had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp\r\nodors of the gig-umbrella, that he repeated the process more than once\r\non his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tulliver, we\xe2\x80\x99re glad to see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Stelling,\r\nheartily. \xe2\x80\x9cTake off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find a bright fire there, and a new companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen\r\ncomforter and other wrappings. He had seen Philip Wakem at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbut had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible. He\r\nwould have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion, even if\r\nPhilip had not been the son of a bad man. And Tom did not see how a bad\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s son could be very good. His own father was a good man, and he\r\nwould readily have fought any one who said the contrary. He was in a\r\nstate of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed Mr Stelling\r\nto the study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthat gentleman on entering the study,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Philip Wakem. I shall\r\nleave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You already know\r\nsomething of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbours at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him\r\ntimidly. Tom did not like to go up and put out his hand, and he was not\r\nprepared to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d on so short a notice.\r\n\r\nMr Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him; boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshyness only wears off in the absence of their elders.\r\n\r\nPhilip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He\r\nthought, or rather felt, that Tom had an aversion to looking at him;\r\nevery one, almost, disliked looking at him; and his deformity was more\r\nconspicuous when he walked. So they remained without shaking hands or\r\neven speaking, while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself, every now\r\nand then casting furtive glances at Philip, who seemed to be drawing\r\nabsently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had\r\nbefore him. He had seated himself again, and as he drew, was thinking\r\nwhat he could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his own repugnance to\r\nmaking the first advances.\r\n\r\nTom began to look oftener and longer at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face, for he could see\r\nit without noticing the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable\r\nface,\xe2\x80\x94very old-looking, Tom thought. He wondered how much older Philip\r\nwas than himself. An anatomist\xe2\x80\x94even a mere physiognomist\xe2\x80\x94would have\r\nseen that the deformity of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s spine was not a congenital hump,\r\nbut the result of an accident in infancy; but you do not expect from\r\nTom any acquaintance with such distinctions; to him, Philip was simply\r\na humpback. He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s son had\r\nsome relation to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s rascality, of which he had so often heard\r\nhis father talk with hot emphasis; and he felt, too, a half-admitted\r\nfear of him as probably a spiteful fellow, who, not being able to fight\r\nyou, had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly. There was a\r\nhumpbacked tailor in the neighbourhood of Mr Jacobs\xe2\x80\x99s academy, who was\r\nconsidered a very unamiable character, and was much hooted after by\r\npublic-spirited boys solely on the ground of his unsatisfactory moral\r\nqualities; so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon.\r\nStill, no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor\xe2\x80\x99s than this\r\nmelancholy boy\xe2\x80\x99s face,\xe2\x80\x94the brown hair round it waved and curled at the\r\nends like a girl\xe2\x80\x99s: Tom thought that truly pitiable. This Wakem was a\r\npale, puny fellow, and it was quite clear he would not be able to play\r\nat anything worth speaking of; but he handled his pencil in an enviable\r\nmanner, and was apparently making one thing after another without any\r\ntrouble. What was he drawing? Tom was quite warm now, and wanted\r\nsomething new to be going forward. It was certainly more agreeable to\r\nhave an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out\r\nof the study window at the rain, and kicking his foot against the\r\nwashboard in solitude; something would happen every day,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca quarrel or\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x9d; and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip that\r\nhe had better not try his spiteful tricks on _him_. He suddenly walked\r\nacross the hearth and looked over Philip\xe2\x80\x99s paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges in\r\nthe corn!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, his tongue being completely loosed by surprise\r\nand admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cOh my buttons! I wish I could draw like that. I\xe2\x80\x99m to\r\nlearn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs and\r\ndonkeys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can do them without learning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip; \xe2\x80\x9cI never learned\r\ndrawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever learned?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when I make dogs and\r\nhorses, and those things, the heads and the legs won\xe2\x80\x99t come right;\r\nthough I can see how they ought to be very well. I can make houses, and\r\nall sorts of chimneys,\xe2\x80\x94chimneys going all down the wall,\xe2\x80\x94and windows in\r\nthe roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if I\r\nwas to try more,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, reflecting that Philip might falsely\r\nsuppose that he was going to \xe2\x80\x9cknock under,\xe2\x80\x9d if he were too frank about\r\nthe imperfection of his accomplishments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very easy. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only to look well at\r\nthings, and draw them over and over again. What you do wrong once, you\r\ncan alter the next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been taught _any_thing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, beginning to have a\r\npuzzled suspicion that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s crooked back might be the source of\r\nremarkable faculties. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d been to school a long while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been taught Latin and Greek and\r\nmathematics, and writing and such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I say, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Latin, though, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\r\nlowering his voice confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care much about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but perhaps you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got into the _Propria qu\xc3\xa6 maribus_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom, nodding his head sideways, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the test;\r\nit was easy talking till you came to _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this\r\nwell-made, active-looking boy; but made polite by his own extreme\r\nsensitiveness, as well as by his desire to conciliate, he checked his\r\ninclination to laugh, and said quietly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done with the grammar; I don\xe2\x80\x99t learn that any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t have the same lessons as I shall?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a\r\nsense of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I dare say I can help you. I shall be very glad to help you if\r\nI can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom did not say \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d for he was quite absorbed in the thought\r\nthat Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you love your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, colouring deeply; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you love yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94I only wanted to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, rather ashamed of himself,\r\nnow he saw Philip colouring and looking uncomfortable. He found much\r\ndifficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward the son of Lawyer\r\nWakem, and it had occurred to him that if Philip disliked his father,\r\nthat fact might go some way toward clearing up his perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you learn drawing now?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, by way of changing the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father wishes me to give all my time to other\r\nthings now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Latin and Euclid, and those things?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, who had left off using his pencil, and was resting\r\nhis head on one hand, while Tom was learning forward on both elbows,\r\nand looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with strong curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I like to know what everybody else knows. I can study what I like\r\nby-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think why anybody should learn Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of the education of a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\ngentlemen learn the same things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you think Sir John Crake, the master of the harriers, knows\r\nLatin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, who had often thought he should like to resemble Sir\r\nJohn Crake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe learned it when he was a boy, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I dare\r\nsay he\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I can do that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, not with any epigrammatic\r\nintention, but with serious satisfaction at the idea that, as far as\r\nLatin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his resembling Sir John\r\nCrake. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly you\xe2\x80\x99re obliged to remember it while you\xe2\x80\x99re at school, else\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to learn ever so many lines of \xe2\x80\x98Speaker.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94did you know? He\xe2\x80\x99ll have you up ten times if you say \xe2\x80\x98nam\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98jam,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go a letter wrong, _I_ can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, unable to choke a laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nremember things easily. And there are some lessons I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of Greek history, and everything about the Greeks. I\r\nshould like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then have\r\ncome home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened to by\r\neverybody for my wisdom, like Socrates, and have died a grand death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Philip, you perceive, was not without a wish to impress the well-made\r\nbarbarian with a sense of his mental superiority.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, were the Greeks great fighters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, who saw a vista in\r\nthis direction. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything like David and Goliath and Samson in\r\nthe Greek history? Those are the only bits I like in the history of the\r\nJews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there are very fine stories of that sort about the Greeks,\xe2\x80\x94about\r\nthe heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts, as Samson did.\r\nAnd in the Odyssey\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful poem\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a more wonderful\r\ngiant than Goliath,\xe2\x80\x94Polypheme, who had only one eye in the middle of\r\nhis forehead; and Ulysses, a little fellow, but very wise and cunning,\r\ngot a red-hot pine-tree and stuck it into this one eye, and made him\r\nroar like a thousand bulls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what fun!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping\r\nfirst with one leg and then the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, can you tell me all\r\nabout those stories? Because I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t learn Greek, you know. Shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm, lest the\r\ncontrary might be possible. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes every gentleman learn Greek? Will Mr\r\nStelling make me begin with it, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I should think not, very likely not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you may\r\nread those stories without knowing Greek. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got them in English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like reading; I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner have you tell them me. But\r\nonly the fighting ones, you know. My sister Maggie is always wanting to\r\ntell me stories, but they\xe2\x80\x99re stupid things. Girls\xe2\x80\x99 stories always are.\r\nCan you tell a good many fighting stories?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip; \xe2\x80\x9clots of them, besides the Greek stories. I can\r\ntell you about Richard C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about William\r\nWallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas,\xe2\x80\x94I know no end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re older than I am, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how old are _you?_ I\xe2\x80\x99m fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only going in fourteen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thrashed all the fellows\r\nat Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where I was before I came here. And I beat \xe2\x80\x99em all at\r\nbandy and climbing. And I wish Mr Stelling would let us go fishing. _I_\r\ncould show you how to fish. You _could_ fish, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nstanding, and sitting still, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, in his turn, wished to make the balance dip in his favour. This\r\nhunchback must not suppose that his acquaintance with fighting stories\r\nput him on a par with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver.\r\nPhilip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports,\r\nand he answered almost peevishly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear fishing. I think people look like fools sitting watching\r\na line hour after hour, or else throwing and throwing, and catching\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say they looked like fools when they landed a big\r\npike, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, who had never caught anything that was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbig\xe2\x80\x9d in his life, but whose imagination was on the stretch with\r\nindignant zeal for the honour of sport. Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s son, it was plain, had\r\nhis disagreeable points, and must be kept in due check. Happily for the\r\nharmony of this first interview, they were now called to dinner, and\r\nPhilip was not allowed to develop farther his unsound views on the\r\nsubject of fishing. But Tom said to himself, that was just what he\r\nshould have expected from a hunchback.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Young Idea\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and\r\nPhilip continued to mark their intercourse even after many weeks of\r\nschoolboy intimacy. Tom never quite lost the feeling that Philip, being\r\nthe son of a \xe2\x80\x9crascal,\xe2\x80\x9d was his natural enemy; never thoroughly overcame\r\nhis repulsion to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s deformity. He was a boy who adhered\r\ntenaciously to impressions once received; as with all minds in which\r\nmere perception predominates over thought and emotion, the external\r\nremained to him rigidly what it was in the first instance. But then it\r\nwas impossible not to like Philip\xe2\x80\x99s company when he was in a good\r\nhumour; he could help one so well in one\xe2\x80\x99s Latin exercises, which Tom\r\nregarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky\r\nchance; and he could tell such wonderful fighting stories about Hal of\r\nthe Wynd, for example, and other heroes who were especial favourites\r\nwith Tom, because they laid about them with heavy strokes. He had small\r\nopinion of Saladin, whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an\r\ninstant; who wanted to cut cushions? That was a stupid story, and he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care to hear it again. But when Robert Bruce, on the black pony,\r\nrose in his stirrups, and lifting his good battle-axe, cracked at once\r\nthe helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at Bannockburn, then\r\nTom felt all the exaltation of sympathy, and if he had had a cocoanut\r\nat hand, he would have cracked it at once with the poker. Philip in his\r\nhappier moods indulged Tom to the top of his bent, heightening the\r\ncrash and bang and fury of every fight with all the artillery of\r\nepithets and similes at his command. But he was not always in a good\r\nhumour or happy mood. The slight spurt of peevish susceptibility which\r\nhad escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of a perpetually\r\nrecurring mental ailment, half of it nervous irritability, half of it\r\nthe heart-bitterness produced by the sense of his deformity. In these\r\nfits of susceptibility every glance seemed to him to be charged either\r\nwith offensive pity or with ill-repressed disgust; at the very least it\r\nwas an indifferent glance, and Philip felt indifference as a child of\r\nthe south feels the chill air of a northern spring. Poor Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblundering patronage when they were out of doors together would\r\nsometimes make him turn upon the well-meaning lad quite savagely; and\r\nhis eyes, usually sad and quiet, would flash with anything but playful\r\nlightning. No wonder Tom retained his suspicions of the humpback.\r\n\r\nBut Philip\xe2\x80\x99s self-taught skill in drawing was another link between\r\nthem; for Tom found, to his disgust, that his new drawing-master gave\r\nhim no dogs and donkeys to draw, but brooks and rustic bridges and\r\nruins, all with a general softness of black-lead surface, indicating\r\nthat nature, if anything, was rather satiny; and as Tom\xe2\x80\x99s feeling for\r\nthe picturesque in landscape was at present quite latent, it is not\r\nsurprising that Mr Goodrich\xe2\x80\x99s productions seemed to him an\r\nuninteresting form of art. Mr Tulliver, having a vague intention that\r\nTom should be put to some business which included the drawing out of\r\nplans and maps, had complained to Mr Riley, when he saw him at Mudport,\r\nthat Tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort; whereupon that\r\nobliging adviser had suggested that Tom should have drawing-lessons. Mr\r\nTulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing; let Tom be made a good\r\ndraughtsman, and he would be able to turn his pencil to any purpose. So\r\nit was ordered that Tom should have drawing-lessons; and whom should Mr\r\nStelling have selected as a master if not Mr Goodrich, who was\r\nconsidered quite at the head of his profession within a circuit of\r\ntwelve miles round King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton? By which means Tom learned to make an\r\nextremely fine point to his pencil, and to represent landscape with a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbroad generality,\xe2\x80\x9d which, doubtless from a narrow tendency in his mind\r\nto details, he thought extremely dull.\r\n\r\nAll this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no\r\nschools of design; before schoolmasters were invariably men of\r\nscrupulous integrity, and before the clergy were all men of enlarged\r\nminds and varied culture. In those less favoured days, it is no fable\r\nthat there were other clergymen besides Mr Stelling who had narrow\r\nintellects and large wants, and whose income, by a logical confusion to\r\nwhich Fortune, being a female as well as blindfold, is peculiarly\r\nliable, was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect,\r\nwith which income has clearly no inherent relation. The problem these\r\ngentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their\r\nwants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to\r\ndeath, the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income. There\r\nwas but one way of doing this; any of those low callings in which men\r\nare obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen;\r\nwas it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor\r\nwork at a high price? Besides, how should Mr Stelling be expected to\r\nknow that education was a delicate and difficult business, any more\r\nthan an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through a rock\r\nshould be expected to have wide views of excavation? Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line, and he\r\nhad no faculty to spare. But among Tom\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaries, whose fathers\r\ncast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after\r\nmany days, there were many far less lucky than Tom Tulliver. Education\r\nwas almost entirely a matter of luck\xe2\x80\x94usually of ill-luck\xe2\x80\x94in those\r\ndistant days. The state of mind in which you take a billiard-cue or a\r\ndice-box in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of\r\nold-fashioned fathers, like Mr Tulliver, when they selected a school or\r\na tutor for their sons. Excellent men, who had been forced all their\r\nlives to spell on an impromptu-phonetic system, and having carried on a\r\nsuccessful business in spite of this disadvantage, had acquired money\r\nenough to give their sons a better start in life than they had had\r\nthemselves, must necessarily take their chance as to the conscience and\r\nthe competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way,\r\nand appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have thought\r\nof asking for, including the return of linen, fork, and spoon. It was\r\nhappy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not\r\nbrought up his son to the Church, and if that young gentleman, at the\r\nage of four-and-twenty, had not closed his college dissipations by an\r\nimprudent marriage; otherwise, these innocent fathers, desirous of\r\ndoing the best for their offspring, could only escape the draper\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nby happening to be on the foundation of a grammar-school as yet\r\nunvisited by commissioners, where two or three boys could have, all to\r\nthemselves, the advantages of a large and lofty building, together with\r\na head-master, toothless, dim-eyed and deaf, whose erudite\r\nindistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of\r\nthree hundred pounds a-head,\xe2\x80\x94a ripe scholar, doubtless, when first\r\nappointed; but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less\r\nesteemed in the market.\r\n\r\nTom Tulliver, then, compared with many other British youths of his time\r\nwho have since had to scramble through life with some fragments of more\r\nor less relevant knowledge, and a great deal of strictly relevant\r\nignorance, was not so very unlucky. Mr Stelling was a broad-chested,\r\nhealthy man, with the bearing of a gentleman, a conviction that a\r\ngrowing boy required a sufficiency of beef, and a certain hearty\r\nkindness in him that made him like to see Tom looking well and enjoying\r\nhis dinner; not a man of refined conscience, or with any deep sense of\r\nthe infinite issues belonging to everyday duties, not quite competent\r\nto his high offices; but incompetent gentlemen must live, and without\r\nprivate fortune it is difficult to see how they could all live\r\ngenteelly if they had nothing to do with education or government.\r\nBesides, it was the fault of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mental constitution that his\r\nfaculties could not be nourished on the sort of knowledge Mr Stelling\r\nhad to communicate. A boy born with a deficient power of apprehending\r\nsigns and abstractions must suffer the penalty of his congenital\r\ndeficiency, just as if he had been born with one leg shorter than the\r\nother. A method of education sanctioned by the long practice of our\r\nvenerable ancestors was not to give way before the exceptional dulness\r\nof a boy who was merely living at the time then present. And Mr\r\nStelling was convinced that a boy so stupid at signs and abstractions\r\nmust be stupid at everything else, even if that reverend gentleman\r\ncould have taught him everything else. It was the practice of our\r\nvenerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument the thumb-screw,\r\nand to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit non-existent facts;\r\nthey had a fixed opinion to begin with, that the facts were existent,\r\nand what had they to do but to tighten the thumb-screw? In like manner,\r\nMr Stelling had a fixed opinion that all boys with any capacity could\r\nlearn what it was the only regular thing to teach; if they were slow,\r\nthe thumb-screw must be tightened,\xe2\x80\x94the exercises must be insisted on\r\nwith increased severity, and a page of Virgil be awarded as a penalty,\r\nto encourage and stimulate a too languid inclination to Latin verse.\r\n\r\nThe thumb-screw was a little relaxed, however, during this second\r\nhalf-year. Philip was so advanced in his studies, and so apt, that Mr\r\nStelling could obtain credit by his facility, which required little\r\nhelp, much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s dulness. Gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do\r\nsometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world before\r\nthem. Perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other unusual\r\nqualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes; perhaps it is\r\nthat these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent, their _divin\xc3\xa6\r\nparticulum aur\xc3\xa6_ being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty\r\nappetite. Some reason or other there was why Mr Stelling deferred the\r\nexecution of many spirited projects,\xe2\x80\x94why he did not begin the editing\r\nof his Greek play, or any other work of scholarship, in his leisure\r\nhours, but, after turning the key of his private study with much\r\nresolution, sat down to one of Theodore Hook\xe2\x80\x99s novels. Tom was\r\ngradually allowed to shuffle through his lessons with less rigor, and\r\nhaving Philip to help him, he was able to make some show of having\r\napplied his mind in a confused and blundering way, without being\r\ncross-examined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely neutral\r\nin the matter. He thought school much more bearable under this\r\nmodification of circumstances; and he went on contentedly enough,\r\npicking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not\r\nintended as education at all. What was understood to be his education\r\nwas simply the practice of reading, writing, and spelling, carried on\r\nby an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas, and by much failure\r\nin the effort to learn by rote.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was a visible improvement in Tom under this\r\ntraining; perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract, existing\r\nsolely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education, but a boy made\r\nof flesh and blood, with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThere was a great improvement in his bearing, for example; and some\r\ncredit on this score was due to Mr Poulter, the village schoolmaster,\r\nwho, being an old Peninsular soldier, was employed to drill Tom,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsource of high mutual pleasure. Mr Poulter, who was understood by the\r\ncompany at the Black Swan to have once struck terror into the hearts of\r\nthe French, was no longer personally formidable. He had rather a\r\nshrunken appearance, and was tremulous in the mornings, not from age,\r\nbut from the extreme perversity of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton boys, which\r\nnothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any firmness. Still,\r\nhe carried himself with martial erectness, had his clothes scrupulously\r\nbrushed, and his trousers tightly strapped; and on the Wednesday and\r\nSaturday afternoons, when he came to Tom, he was always inspired with\r\ngin and old memories, which gave him an exceptionally spirited air, as\r\nof a superannuated charger who hears the drum. The drilling-lessons\r\nwere always protracted by episodes of warlike narrative, much more\r\ninteresting to Tom than Philip\xe2\x80\x99s stories out of the Iliad; for there\r\nwere no cannon in the Iliad, and besides, Tom had felt some disgust on\r\nlearning that Hector and Achilles might possibly never have existed.\r\nBut the Duke of Wellington was really alive, and Bony had not been long\r\ndead; therefore Mr Poulter\xe2\x80\x99s reminiscences of the Peninsular War were\r\nremoved from all suspicion of being mythical. Mr Poulter, it appeared,\r\nhad been a conspicuous figure at Talavera, and had contributed not a\r\nlittle to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of infantry was\r\nregarded by the enemy. On afternoons when his memory was more\r\nstimulated than usual, he remembered that the Duke of Wellington had\r\n(in strict privacy, lest jealousies should be awakened) expressed his\r\nesteem for that fine fellow Poulter. The very surgeon who attended him\r\nin the hospital after he had received his gunshot-wound had been\r\nprofoundly impressed with the superiority of Mr Poulter\xe2\x80\x99s flesh,\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nother flesh would have healed in anything like the same time. On less\r\npersonal matters connected with the important warfare in which he had\r\nbeen engaged, Mr Poulter was more reticent, only taking care not to\r\ngive the weight of his authority to any loose notions concerning\r\nmilitary history. Any one who pretended to a knowledge of what occurred\r\nat the siege of Badajos was especially an object of silent pity to Mr\r\nPoulter; he wished that prating person had been run down, and had the\r\nbreath trampled out of him at the first go-off, as he himself had,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nmight talk about the siege of Badajos then! Tom did not escape\r\nirritating his drilling-master occasionally, by his curiosity\r\nconcerning other military matters than Mr Poulter\xe2\x80\x99s personal\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd General Wolfe, Mr Poulter,\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he a wonderful fighter?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom, who held the notion that all the martial heroes commemorated on\r\nthe public-house signs were engaged in the war with Bony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing o\xe2\x80\x99 the sort!\r\nHeads up!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a tone of stern command, which delighted Tom,\r\nand made him feel as if he were a regiment in his own person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Poulter would continue, on coming to a pause in his\r\ndiscipline; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99d better not talk to me about General Wolfe. He did\r\nnothing but die of his wound; that\xe2\x80\x99s a poor haction, I consider. Any\r\nother man \xe2\x80\x99ud have died o\xe2\x80\x99 the wounds I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. One of my sword-cuts\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 killed a fellow like General Wolfe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Poulter,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom would say, at any allusion to the sword, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d bring your sword and do the sword-exercise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long while Mr Poulter only shook his head in a significant manner\r\nat this request, and smiled patronizingly, as Jupiter may have done\r\nwhen Semele urged her too ambitious request. But one afternoon, when a\r\nsudden shower of heavy rain had detained Mr Poulter twenty minutes\r\nlonger than usual at the Black Swan, the sword was brought,\xe2\x80\x94just for\r\nTom to look at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles, Mr\r\nPoulter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, handling the hilt. \xe2\x80\x9cHas it ever cut a Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHead off? Ah! and would, if he\xe2\x80\x99d had three heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had a gun and bayonet besides?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should like the\r\ngun and bayonet best, because you could shoot \xe2\x80\x99em first and spear \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nafter. Bang! Ps-s-s-s!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom gave the requisite pantomime to indicate\r\nthe double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting the spear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but the sword\xe2\x80\x99s the thing when you come to close fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Poulter, involuntarily falling in with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, and drawing\r\nthe sword so suddenly that Tom leaped back with much agility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, Mr Poulter, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do the exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, a\r\nlittle conscious that he had not stood his ground as became an\r\nEnglishman, \xe2\x80\x9clet me go and call Philip. He\xe2\x80\x99ll like to see you, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the humpbacked lad?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter, contemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of _his_ looking on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but he knows a great deal about fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cand how they\r\nused to fight with bows and arrows, and battle-axes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show him something different from his bows\r\nand arrows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter, coughing and drawing himself up, while he\r\ngave a little preliminary play to his wrist.\r\n\r\nTom ran in to Philip, who was enjoying his afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s holiday at the\r\npiano, in the drawing-room, picking out tunes for himself and singing\r\nthem. He was supremely happy, perched like an amorphous bundle on the\r\nhigh stool, with his head thrown back, his eyes fixed on the opposite\r\ncornice, and his lips wide open, sending forth, with all his might,\r\nimpromptu syllables to a tune of Arne\xe2\x80\x99s which had hit his fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, bursting in; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t stay roaring \xe2\x80\x98la la\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere; come and see old Poulter do his sword-exercise in the\r\ncarriage-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jar of this interruption, the discord of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s tones coming across\r\nthe notes to which Philip was vibrating in soul and body, would have\r\nbeen enough to unhinge his temper, even if there had been no question\r\nof Poulter the drilling-master; and Tom, in the hurry of seizing\r\nsomething to say to prevent Mr Poulter from thinking he was afraid of\r\nthe sword when he sprang away from it, had alighted on this proposition\r\nto fetch Philip, though he knew well enough that Philip hated to hear\r\nhim mention his drilling-lessons. Tom would never have done so\r\ninconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his personal\r\npride.\r\n\r\nPhilip shuddered visibly as he paused from his music. Then turning red,\r\nhe said, with violent passion,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, you lumbering idiot! Don\xe2\x80\x99t come bellowing at me; you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nfit to speak to anything but a cart-horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him, but Tom\r\nhad never before been assailed with verbal missiles that he understood\r\nso well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited imp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tom, lighting up immediately at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s fire. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhit you, because you\xe2\x80\x99re no better than a girl. But I\xe2\x80\x99m an honest man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, and _your_ father\xe2\x80\x99s a rogue; everybody says so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom flung out of the room, and slammed the door after him, made\r\nstrangely heedless by his anger; for to slam doors within the hearing\r\nof Mrs Stelling, who was probably not far off, was an offence only to\r\nbe wiped out by twenty lines of Virgil. In fact, that lady did\r\npresently descend from her room, in double wonder at the noise and the\r\nsubsequent cessation of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s music. She found him sitting in a heap\r\non the hassock, and crying bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Wakem? what was that noise about? Who slammed the\r\ndoor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked up, and hastily dried his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was Tulliver who came\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94to ask me to go out with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you in trouble about?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Stelling.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not her favourite of the two pupils; he was less obliging\r\nthan Tom, who was made useful in many ways. Still, his father paid more\r\nthan Mr Tulliver did, and she meant him to feel that she behaved\r\nexceedingly well to him. Philip, however, met her advances toward a\r\ngood understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation\r\nto show himself out of his shell. Mrs Stelling was not a loving,\r\ntender-hearted woman; she was a woman whose skirt sat well, who\r\nadjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air when she\r\ninquired after your welfare. These things, doubtless, represent a great\r\nsocial power, but it is not the power of love; and no other power could\r\nwin Philip from his personal reserve.\r\n\r\nHe said, in answer to her question, \xe2\x80\x9cMy toothache came on, and made me\r\nhysterical again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had been the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection;\r\nit was like an inspiration to enable him to excuse his crying. He had\r\nto accept eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence; but\r\nthat was easy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tom, who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart, had returned to the carriage-house, where he found Mr\r\nPoulter, with a fixed and earnest eye, wasting the perfections of his\r\nsword-exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats. But Mr\r\nPoulter was a host in himself; that is to say, he admired himself more\r\nthan a whole army of spectators could have admired him. He took no\r\nnotice of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s return, being too entirely absorbed in the cut and\r\nthrust,\xe2\x80\x94the solemn one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a slight\r\nfeeling of alarm at Mr Poulter\xe2\x80\x99s fixed eye and hungry-looking sword,\r\nwhich seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the air,\r\nadmired the performance from as great a distance as possible. It was\r\nnot until Mr Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead, that Tom felt the full charm of the sword-exercise, and\r\nwished it to be repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Poulter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when the sword was being finally sheathed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you\xe2\x80\x99d lend me your sword a little while to keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo no, young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter, shaking his head decidedly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou might do yourself some mischief with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d take care and not hurt myself. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it out of the sheath much, but I could ground arms with\r\nit, and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do, I tell you; it won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter,\r\npreparing to depart. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x99ud Mr Stelling say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, do, Mr Poulter! I\xe2\x80\x99d give you my five-shilling piece if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d let me keep the sword a week. Look here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, reaching out\r\nthe attractively large round of silver. The young dog calculated the\r\neffect as well as if he had been a philosopher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter, with still deeper gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must keep it\r\nout of sight, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it under the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cor else at\r\nthe bottom of my large box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let me see, now, whether you can draw it out of the sheath without\r\nhurting yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d That process having been gone through more than\r\nonce, Mr Poulter felt that he had acted with scrupulous\r\nconscientiousness, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, Master Tulliver, if I take the\r\ncrown-piece, it is to make sure as you\xe2\x80\x99ll do no mischief with the\r\nsword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, indeed, Mr Poulter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, delightedly handing him the\r\ncrown-piece, and grasping the sword, which, he thought, might have been\r\nlighter with advantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Mr Stelling catches you carrying it in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Poulter,\r\npocketing the crown-piece provisionally while he raised this new doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he always keeps in his upstairs study on Saturday afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom, who disliked anything sneaking, but was not disinclined to a\r\nlittle stratagem in a worthy cause. So he carried off the sword in\r\ntriumph mixed with dread\xe2\x80\x94dread that he might encounter Mr or Mrs\r\nStelling\xe2\x80\x94to his bedroom, where, after some consideration, he hid it in\r\nthe closet behind some hanging clothes. That night he fell asleep in\r\nthe thought that he would astonish Maggie with it when she came,\xe2\x80\x94tie it\r\nround his waist with his red comforter, and make her believe that the\r\nsword was his own, and that he was going to be a soldier. There was\r\nnobody but Maggie who would be silly enough to believe him, or whom he\r\ndared allow to know he had a sword; and Maggie was really coming next\r\nweek to see Tom, before she went to a boarding-school with Lucy.\r\n\r\nIf you think a lad of thirteen would not have been so childish, you\r\nmust be an exceptionally wise man, who, although you are devoted to a\r\ncivil calling, requiring you to look bland rather than formidable, yet\r\nnever, since you had a beard, threw yourself into a martial attitude,\r\nand frowned before the looking-glass. It is doubtful whether our\r\nsoldiers would be maintained if there were not pacific people at home\r\nwho like to fancy themselves soldiers. War, like other dramatic\r\nspectacles, might possibly cease for want of a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s Second Visit\r\n\r\nThis last breach between the two lads was not readily mended, and for\r\nsome time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary. Their\r\nnatural antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to\r\nhatred, and in Philip the transition seemed to have begun; there was no\r\nmalignity in his disposition, but there was a susceptibility that made\r\nhim peculiarly liable to a strong sense of repulsion. The ox\xe2\x80\x94we may\r\nventure to assert it on the authority of a great classic\xe2\x80\x94is not given\r\nto use his teeth as an instrument of attack, and Tom was an excellent\r\nbovine lad, who ran at questionable objects in a truly ingenious bovine\r\nmanner; but he had blundered on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s tenderest point, and had\r\ncaused him as much acute pain as if he had studied the means with the\r\nnicest precision and the most envenomed spite. Tom saw no reason why\r\nthey should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others, by\r\nbehaving as if nothing had happened; for though he had never before\r\nsaid to Philip that his father was a rogue, this idea had so habitually\r\nmade part of his feeling as to the relation between himself and his\r\ndubious schoolfellow, whom he could neither like nor dislike, that the\r\nmere utterance did not make such an epoch to him as it did to Philip.\r\nAnd he had a right to say so when Philip hectored over _him_, and\r\ncalled him names. But perceiving that his first advances toward amity\r\nwere not met, he relapsed into his least favourable disposition toward\r\nPhilip, and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing or\r\nexercise again. They were only so far civil to each other as was\r\nnecessary to prevent their state of feud from being observed by Mr\r\nStelling, who would have \xe2\x80\x9cput down\xe2\x80\x9d such nonsense with great vigor.\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie came, however, she could not help looking with growing\r\ninterest at the new schoolfellow, although he was the son of that\r\nwicked Lawyer Wakem, who made her father so angry. She had arrived in\r\nthe middle of school-hours, and had sat by while Philip went through\r\nhis lessons with Mr Stelling. Tom, some weeks ago, had sent her word\r\nthat Philip knew no end of stories,\xe2\x80\x94not stupid stories like hers; and\r\nshe was convinced now from her own observation that he must be very\r\nclever; she hoped he would think _her_ rather clever too, when she came\r\nto talk to him. Maggie, moreover, had rather a tenderness for deformed\r\nthings; she preferred the wry-necked lambs, because it seemed to her\r\nthat the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind so\r\nmuch about being petted; and she was especially fond of petting objects\r\nthat would think it very delightful to be petted by her. She loved Tom\r\nvery dearly, but she often wished that he _cared_ more about her loving\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when they went\r\nout of the study together into the garden, to pass the interval before\r\ndinner. \xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t choose his father, you know; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve read of very\r\nbad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad\r\nchildren. And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry\r\nfor him because his father is not a good man. _You_ like him, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a queer fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, curtly, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s as sulky as can\r\nbe with me, because I told him his father was a rogue. And I\xe2\x80\x99d a right\r\nto tell him so, for it was true; and _he_ began it, with calling me\r\nnames. But you stop here by yourself a bit, Maggie, will you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsomething I want to do upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I go too?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, who in this first day of meeting again\r\nloved Tom\xe2\x80\x99s shadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about by-and-by, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\r\nskipping away.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study, preparing\r\nthe morrow\xe2\x80\x99s lessons that they might have a holiday in the evening in\r\nhonour of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. Tom was hanging over his Latin grammar,\r\nmoving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic\r\nrepeating his tale of paternosters; and Philip, at the other end of the\r\nroom, was busy with two volumes, with a look of contented diligence\r\nthat excited Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity; he did not look at all as if he were\r\nlearning a lesson. She sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with\r\nthe two boys, watching first one and then the other; and Philip,\r\nlooking off his book once toward the fire-place, caught the pair of\r\nquestioning dark eyes fixed upon him. He thought this sister of\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her brother; he\r\nwished _he_ had a little sister. What was it, he wondered, that made\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being\r\nturned into animals? I think it was that her eyes were full of\r\nunsatisfied intelligence, and unsatisfied beseeching affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Magsie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom at last, shutting his books and putting them\r\naway with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of\r\nleaving off, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done my lessons now. Come upstairs with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, when they were outside the door, a slight\r\nsuspicion crossing her mind as she remembered Tom\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary visit\r\nupstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a trick you\xe2\x80\x99re going to play me, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in his most coaxing tone; \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll like _ever so_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her neck, and she put hers round his waist, and\r\ntwined together in this way, they went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9celse I\r\nshall get fifty lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it alive?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the\r\nmoment on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you go into that corner and\r\nhide your face, while I reach it out,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he locked the\r\nbedroom door behind them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when to turn round. You\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t squeal out, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but if you frighten me, I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, beginning to look\r\nrather serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, you silly thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and hide your\r\nface, and mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t peep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t peep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, disdainfully; and she buried\r\nher face in the pillow like a person of strict honour.\r\n\r\nBut Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet; then he stepped\r\ninto the narrow space, and almost closed the door. Maggie kept her face\r\nburied without the aid of principle, for in that dream-suggestive\r\nattitude she had soon forgotten where she was, and her thoughts were\r\nbusy with the poor deformed boy, who was so clever, when Tom called\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Magsie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects\r\ncould have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to\r\nMaggie when she looked up. Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a\r\nface which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow,\r\ntogether with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes and round pink cheeks\r\nthat refused to look formidable, let him frown as he would before the\r\nlooking-glass (Philip had once told him of a man who had a horseshoe\r\nfrown, and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a\r\nhorseshoe on his forehead), he had had recourse to that unfailing\r\nsource of the terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself a pair of\r\nblack eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose, and\r\nwere matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin. He\r\nhad wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of\r\na turban, and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf,\xe2\x80\x94an amount\r\nof red which, with the tremendous frown on his brow, and the decision\r\nwith which he grasped the sword, as he held it with its point resting\r\non the ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his\r\nfierce and bloodthirsty disposition.\r\n\r\nMaggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment\r\nkeenly; but in the next she laughed, clapped her hands together, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made yourself like Bluebeard at the show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword,\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas not unsheathed. Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to\r\nits sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared for his master-stroke.\r\nFrowning with a double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he\r\n(carefully) drew the sword from its sheath, and pointed it at Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, please don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of suppressed\r\ndread, shrinking away from him into the opposite corner. \xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_\r\nscream\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shall! Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never come upstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe corners of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mouth showed an inclination to a smile of\r\ncomplacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the\r\nseverity of a great warrior. Slowly he let down the scabbard on the\r\nfloor, lest it should make too much noise, and then said sternly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Duke of Wellington! March!\xe2\x80\x9d stamping forward with the right\r\nleg a little bent, and the sword still pointing toward Maggie, who,\r\ntrembling, and with tear-filled eyes, got upon the bed, as the only\r\nmeans of widening the space between them.\r\n\r\nTom, happy in this spectator of his military performances, even though\r\nthe spectator was only Maggie, proceeded, with the utmost exertion of\r\nhis force, to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would\r\nnecessarily be expected of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, I _will not_ bear it, I _will_ scream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, at the first\r\nmovement of the sword. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt yourself; you\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your head\r\noff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x94two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, resolutely, though at \xe2\x80\x9ctwo\xe2\x80\x9d his wrist trembled a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9cThree\xe2\x80\x9d came more slowly, and with it the sword swung downward,\r\nand Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword had fallen, with its edge on\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s foot, and in a moment after he had fallen too. Maggie leaped from\r\nthe bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was a rush of footsteps\r\ntoward the room. Mr Stelling, from his upstairs study, was the first to\r\nenter. He found both the children on the floor. Tom had fainted, and\r\nMaggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket, screaming, with\r\nwild eyes. She thought he was dead, poor child! and yet she shook him,\r\nas if that would bring him back to life. In another minute she was\r\nsobbing with joy because Tom opened his eyes. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sorrow yet\r\nthat he had hurt his foot; it seemed as if all happiness lay in his\r\nbeing alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nA Love-Scene\r\n\r\nPoor Tom bore his severe pain heroically, and was resolute in not\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctelling\xe2\x80\x9d of Mr Poulter more than was unavoidable; the five-shilling\r\npiece remained a secret even to Maggie. But there was a terrible dread\r\nweighing on his mind, so terrible that he dared not even ask the\r\nquestion which might bring the fatal \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d; he dared not ask the\r\nsurgeon or Mr Stelling, \xe2\x80\x9cShall I be lame, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d He mastered himself so\r\nas not to cry out at the pain; but when his foot had been dressed, and\r\nhe was left alone with Maggie seated by his bedside, the children\r\nsobbed together, with their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was\r\nthinking of himself walking about on crutches, like the wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his mind, sobbed for\r\ncompany. It had not occurred to the surgeon or to Mr Stelling to\r\nanticipate this dread in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and to reassure him by hopeful\r\nwords. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house, and waylaid Mr\r\nStelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x94but does Mr Askern say Tulliver will be lame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; oh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Stelling, \xe2\x80\x9cnot permanently; only for a little\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell Tulliver so, sir, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; nothing was said to him on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen may I go and tell him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure; now you mention it, I dare say he may be troubling\r\nabout that. Go to his bedroom, but be very quiet at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been Philip\xe2\x80\x99s first thought when he heard of the accident,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nTulliver be lame? It will be very hard for him if he is\xe2\x80\x9d; and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that pity. Philip felt\r\nthat they were no longer in a state of repulsion, but were being drawn\r\ninto a common current of suffering and sad privation. His imagination\r\ndid not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, but it made vividly present to him the probable state of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling. Philip had only lived fourteen years, but those years had,\r\nmost of them, been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Askern says you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather timidly, as he stepped gently up to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been to ask Mr Stelling, and he says you\xe2\x80\x99ll walk as well as\r\never again by-and-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes\r\nwith a sudden joy; then he gave a long sigh, and turned his blue-gray\r\neyes straight on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he had not done for a fortnight or\r\nmore. As for Maggie, this intimation of a possibility she had not\r\nthought of before affected her as a new trouble; the bare idea of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing always lame overpowered the assurance that such a misfortune was\r\nnot likely to befall him, and she clung to him and cried afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a little silly, Magsie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, tenderly, feeling very\r\nbrave now. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, putting out his small, delicate hand,\r\nwhich Tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cask Mr Stelling to let you come and sit with me\r\nsometimes, till I get up again, Wakem; and tell me about Robert Bruce,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, Philip spent all his time out of school-hours with Tom and\r\nMaggie. Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he\r\ninsisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so many\r\nwonderful things and came off unhurt, wore excellent armor from head to\r\nfoot, which made fighting easy work, he considered. He should not have\r\nhurt his foot if he had had an iron shoe on. He listened with great\r\ninterest to a new story of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s about a man who had a very bad\r\nwound in his foot, and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that his\r\nfriends could bear with him no longer, but put him ashore on a desert\r\nisland, with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals\r\nwith for food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t roar out a bit, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I dare say my foot\r\nwas as bad as his. It\xe2\x80\x99s cowardly to roar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much, it was\r\nquite permissible to cry out, and it was cruel of people not to bear\r\nit. She wanted to know if Philoctetes had a sister, and why _she_\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go with him on the desert island and take care of him.\r\n\r\nOne day, soon after Philip had told this story, he and Maggie were in\r\nthe study alone together while Tom\xe2\x80\x99s foot was being dressed. Philip was\r\nat his books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly round the room, not\r\ncaring to do anything in particular, because she would soon go to Tom\r\nagain, went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he was\r\ndoing, for they were quite old friends now, and perfectly at home with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading about in Greek?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s poetry, I can\r\nsee that, because the lines are so short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking at her as if he\r\nwere not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her absent way,\r\ncontinued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet\r\nabout, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if\r\nshe had quite forgotten Philip and his book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his\r\nelbow and looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cif you had had a brother like me, do you\r\nthink you should have loved him as well as Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, better,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not better; because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I _could_ love you better than Tom. But I should be so\r\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x94_so sorry_ for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip coloured; he had meant to imply, would she love him as well in\r\nspite of his deformity, and yet when she alluded to it so plainly, he\r\nwinced under her pity. Maggie, young as she was, felt her mistake.\r\nHitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious\r\nof Philip\xe2\x80\x99s deformity; her own keen sensitiveness and experience under\r\nfamily criticism sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been\r\ndirected by the most finished breeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you _were_ my brother. I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of you. And\r\nyou would stay at home with me when Tom went out, and you would teach\r\nme everything; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x94Greek and everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll go away soon, and go to school, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99ll forget all about me, and not care for me any more. And then\r\nI shall see you when you\xe2\x80\x99re grown up, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly take any notice\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t forget you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, shaking her head\r\nvery seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI never forget anything, and I think about everybody\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m away from them. I think about poor Yap; he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lump in his\r\nthroat, and Luke says he\xe2\x80\x99ll die. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Tom. because it\r\nwill vex him so. You never saw Yap; he\xe2\x80\x99s a queer little dog,\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\ncares about him but Tom and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, smiling rather sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I should think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of _you_, Maggie; I shall never forget _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, \xe2\x80\x9cand when I\xe2\x80\x99m very unhappy, I shall always think of you, and\r\nwish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you like my eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, well pleased. She had never\r\nheard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not like any other eyes. They\r\nseem trying to speak,\xe2\x80\x94trying to speak kindly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like other people\r\nto look at me much, but I like you to look at me, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re fonder of me than Tom is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rather\r\nsorrowfully. Then, wondering how she could convince Philip that she\r\ncould like him just as well, although he was crooked, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom? I will, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much; nobody kisses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always remember you, and kiss you when\r\nI see you again, if it\xe2\x80\x99s ever so long. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go now, because I think\r\nMr Askern\xe2\x80\x99s done with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen their father came the second time, Maggie said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nfather, Philip Wakem is so very good to Tom; he is such a clever boy,\r\nand I _do_ love him. And you love him too, Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? _Say_ you\r\nlove him,\xe2\x80\x9d she added entreatingly.\r\n\r\nTom coloured a little as he looked at his father, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe friends with him when I leave school, father; but we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it up\r\nnow, since my foot has been bad, and he\xe2\x80\x99s taught me to play at\r\ndraughts, and I can beat him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cif he\xe2\x80\x99s good to you, try and make him\r\namends, and be good to _him_. He\xe2\x80\x99s a poor crooked creature, and takes\r\nafter his dead mother. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you be getting too thick with him;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got his father\xe2\x80\x99s blood in him too. Ay, ay, the gray colt may\r\nchance to kick like his black sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmonition alone might have failed to effect; in spite of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nkindness, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s answering regard in this time of his trouble, they\r\nnever became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom\r\nby-and-by began to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had\r\nbeen kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees, and left them\r\nin their old relation to each other. Philip was often peevish and\r\ncontemptuous; and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s more specific and kindly impressions gradually\r\nmelted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a\r\nqueer fellow, a humpback, and the son of a rogue. If boys and men are\r\nto be welded together in the glow of transient feeling, they must be\r\nmade of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder when the\r\nheat dies out.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Gates Are Passed\r\n\r\nSo Tom went on even to the fifth half-year\xe2\x80\x94till he was turned\r\nsixteen\xe2\x80\x94at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity\r\nwhich her aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with\r\ncousin Lucy for her companion. In her early letters to Tom she had\r\nalways sent her love to Philip, and asked many questions about him,\r\nwhich were answered by brief sentences about Tom\xe2\x80\x99s toothache, and a\r\nturf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other\r\nitems of that kind. She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that\r\nPhilip was as queer as ever again, and often cross. They were no longer\r\nvery good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that he\r\nought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was\r\nbad, he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault; _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their\r\nschool-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the\r\nseaside, and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in\r\nthe street of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. When they did meet, she remembered her promise\r\nto kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school,\r\nshe knew now that such a greeting was out of the question, and Philip\r\nwould not expect it. The promise was void, like so many other sweet,\r\nillusory promises of our childhood; void as promises made in Eden\r\nbefore the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew side\r\nby side with the ripening peach,\xe2\x80\x94impossible to be fulfilled when the\r\ngolden gates had been passed.\r\n\r\nBut when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened\r\nlawsuit, and Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was\r\nacting against him, even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they were\r\nnot likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very name\r\nof Wakem made her father angry, and she had once heard him say that if\r\nthat crook-backed son lived to inherit his father\xe2\x80\x99s ill-gotten gains,\r\nthere would be a curse upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave as little to do with him at\r\nschool as you can, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Tom; and the command was obeyed\r\nthe more easily because Mr Sterling by this time had two additional\r\npupils; for though this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the world was not of that\r\nmeteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence\r\nhad expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he\r\nhad yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his\r\nexpenditure in continued disproportion to his income.\r\n\r\nAs for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his\r\nmind continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium of\r\nuninteresting or unintelligible ideas. But each vacation he brought\r\nhome larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape,\r\nand water-colours in vivid greens, together with manuscript books full\r\nof exercises and problems, in which the handwriting was all the finer\r\nbecause he gave his whole mind to it. Each vacation he brought home a\r\nnew book or two, indicating his progress through different stages of\r\nhistory, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that passage was\r\nnot entirely without results, besides the possession of the books.\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and\r\nphrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and\r\nthough he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons,\r\nthe lessons had left a deposit of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual\r\nnotions. Mr Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of\r\nhis own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neducation; he observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csumming\xe2\x80\x9d; but he made no formal complaint to Mr Stelling. It was a\r\npuzzling business, this schooling; and if he took Tom away, where could\r\nhe send him with better effect?\r\n\r\nBy the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton, the\r\nyears had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him\r\nreturning from Mr Jacobs\xe2\x80\x99s academy. He was a tall youth now, carrying\r\nhimself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more\r\nshyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he\r\nwore his tail-coat and his stand-up collars, and watched the down on\r\nhis lip with eager impatience, looking every day at his virgin razor,\r\nwith which he had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip had\r\nalready left,\xe2\x80\x94at the autumn quarter,\xe2\x80\x94that he might go to the south for\r\nthe winter, for the sake of his health; and this change helped to give\r\nTom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last\r\nmonths before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some hope of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit being decided; _that_ made the prospect of home\r\nmore entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had gathered his view of the\r\ncase from his father\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, had no doubt that Pivart would be\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nTom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,\xe2\x80\x94a fact which did\r\nnot surprise him, for his father and mother were not apt to manifest\r\ntheir affection in unnecessary letters,\xe2\x80\x94when, to his great surprise, on\r\nthe morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he was told,\r\nsoon after entering the study at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, that his sister was in\r\nthe drawing-room. It was Mrs Stelling who had come into the study to\r\ntell him, and she left him to enter the drawing-room alone.\r\n\r\nMaggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she was almost\r\nas tall as Tom, though she was only thirteen; and she really looked\r\nolder than he did at that moment. She had thrown off her bonnet, her\r\nheavy braids were pushed back from her forehead, as if it would not\r\nbear that extra load, and her young face had a strangely worn look, as\r\nher eyes turned anxiously toward the door. When Tom entered she did not\r\nspeak, but only went up to him, put her arms round his neck, and kissed\r\nhim earnestly. He was used to various moods of hers, and felt no alarm\r\nat the unusual seriousness of her greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how is it you\xe2\x80\x99re come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did you\r\ncome in the gig?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew him\r\nto her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I came by the coach. I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked from the turnpike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how is it you\xe2\x80\x99re not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather wanted me at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with a slight trembling of the\r\nlip. \xe2\x80\x9cI came home three or four days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t my father well?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, rather anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is\r\nended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for\r\nyou to know it before you came home, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like only to send you\r\na letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa,\r\nand standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking up at him with trembling.\r\n\r\nTom was silent a minute or two, with his eyes fixed on the floor. Then\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rather faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, bravely, not translating the loss\r\nof a large sum of money into any tangible results. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery much vexed, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at Maggie, and thinking\r\nthat her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s freedom from apprehension, she said loudly and rapidly, as if the\r\nwords _would_ burst from her: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, he will lose the mill and the\r\nland and everything; he will have nothing left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her, before he turned\r\npale, and trembled visibly. He said nothing, but sat down on the sofa\r\nagain, looking vaguely out of the opposite window.\r\n\r\nAnxiety about the future had never entered Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind. His father had\r\nalways ridden a good horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful,\r\nconfident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon.\r\nTom had never dreamed that his father would \xe2\x80\x9cfail\xe2\x80\x9d; _that_ was a form\r\nof misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace,\r\nand disgrace was an idea that he could not associate with any of his\r\nrelations, least of all with his father. A proud sense of family\r\nrespectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought\r\nup in. He knew there were people in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s who made a show without\r\nmoney to support it, and he had always heard such people spoken of by\r\nhis own friends with contempt and reprobation. He had a strong belief,\r\nwhich was a lifelong habit, and required no definite evidence to rest\r\non, that his father could spend a great deal of money if he chose; and\r\nsince his education at Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s had given him a more expensive\r\nview of life, he had often thought that when he got older he would make\r\na figure in the world, with his horse and dogs and saddle, and other\r\naccoutrements of a fine young man, and show himself equal to any of his\r\ncontemporaries at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, who might consider themselves a grade above\r\nhim in society because their fathers were professional men, or had\r\nlarge oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and\r\nuncles, they had never produced the least effect on him, except to make\r\nhim think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable society; he had heard\r\nthem find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember. His\r\nfather knew better than they did.\r\n\r\nThe down had come on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s lip, yet his thoughts and expectations had\r\nbeen hitherto only the reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish\r\ndreams in which he had lived three years ago. He was awakened now with\r\na violent shock.\r\n\r\nMaggie was frightened at Tom\xe2\x80\x99s pale, trembling silence. There was\r\nsomething else to tell him,\xe2\x80\x94something worse. She threw her arms round\r\nhim at last, and said, with a half sob:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom\xe2\x80\x94dear, dear Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t fret too much; try and bear it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses, and there\r\ngathered a moisture in his eyes, which he just rubbed away with his\r\nhand. The action seemed to rouse him, for he shook himself and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall go home, with you, Maggie. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t my father say I was to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tom, father didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, her anxiety about _his_\r\nfeeling helping her to master her agitation. What _would_ he do when\r\nshe told him all? \xe2\x80\x9cBut mother wants you to come,\xe2\x80\x94poor mother!\xe2\x80\x94she cries\r\nso. Oh, Tom, it\xe2\x80\x99s very dreadful at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s lips grew whiter, and she began to tremble almost as Tom had\r\ndone. The two poor things clung closer to each other, both\r\ntrembling,\xe2\x80\x94the one at an unshapen fear, the other at the image of a\r\nterrible certainty. When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94poor father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A\r\nvague idea of going to prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape\r\nhis fears had begun to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my father?\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9c_Tell_ me, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to that\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cnot himself\xe2\x80\x94he fell off his\r\nhorse. He has known nobody but me ever since\xe2\x80\x94he seems to have lost his\r\nsenses. O father, father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these last words, Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s sobs burst forth with the more violence\r\nfor the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that pressure of the\r\nheart which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision of their troubles\r\nas Maggie had, who had been at home; he only felt the crushing weight\r\nof what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost\r\nconvulsively round Maggie as she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and\r\ntearless, his eyes blank,\xe2\x80\x94as if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly\r\nfallen on his path.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted on\r\nher like a startling sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must\r\nbe at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach.\xe2\x80\x9d She said this with hasty\r\ndecision, rubbing her eyes, and rising to seize her bonnet.\r\n\r\nTom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\r\nMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must speak to Mr Stelling, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought he must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his\r\nway he met Mr Stelling, who had heard from his wife that Maggie\r\nappeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother, and now that\r\nhe thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough, was\r\ncoming to inquire and offer his sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, I must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said abruptly, as he met Mr Stelling\r\nin the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back with my sister directly. My father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlost his lawsuit\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s lost all his property\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99s very ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he foresaw a probable money\r\nloss for himself, but this had no appreciable share in his feeling,\r\nwhile he looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom\r\nyouth and sorrow had begun together. When he knew how Maggie had come,\r\nand how eager she was to get home again, he hurried their departure,\r\nonly whispering something to Mrs Stelling, who had followed him, and\r\nwho immediately left the room.\r\n\r\nTom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when\r\nMrs Stelling came with a little basket, which she hung on Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cDo remember to eat something on the way, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwent out toward this woman whom she had never liked, and she kissed her\r\nsilently. It was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense\r\nwhich is the gift of sorrow,\xe2\x80\x94that susceptibility to the bare offices of\r\nhumanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship, as to\r\nhaggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of an ordinary\r\ncomrade stirs the deep fountains of affection.\r\n\r\nMr Stelling put his hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and said: \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, my\r\nboy; let me know how you get on.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he pressed Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s hand; but\r\nthere were no audible good-byes. Tom had so often thought how joyful he\r\nshould be the day he left school \xe2\x80\x9cfor good\xe2\x80\x9d! And now his school years\r\nseemed like a holiday that had come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant\r\nroad,\xe2\x80\x94were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow.\r\n\r\nThey had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would\r\nnever more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares. They had\r\nentered the thorny wilderness, and the golden gates of their childhood\r\nhad forever closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nWhat Had Happened at Home\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Tulliver first knew the fact that the lawsuit was decided\r\nagainst him, and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who\r\nhappened to observe him at the time thought that, for so confident and\r\nhot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well. He thought so\r\nhimself; he thought he was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else\r\nconsidered him crushed, they would find themselves mistaken. He could\r\nnot refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take\r\nmore than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be\r\nfull of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as\r\nwere tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the\r\nworld. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of\r\ntheir old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate\r\nformation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain\r\nMr Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them. There was such a rush of\r\nprojects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face was flushed when\r\nhe came away from his talk with his attorney, Mr Gore, and mounted his\r\nhorse to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held the mortgage\r\non the land,\xe2\x80\x94a reasonable fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr\r\nTulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only to purchase the\r\nwhole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr\r\nTulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with\r\nhigh interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made\r\nover to him, Mr Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself\r\nand his family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment?\r\nCertainly not Furley, for Mr Tulliver had determined that Furley should\r\nmeet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses\r\nbrains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit,\r\nwho are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s actions. There was no doubt (in the miller\xe2\x80\x99s mind) that Furley\r\nwould do just what was desirable; and if he did\xe2\x80\x94why, things would not\r\nbe so very much worse. Mr Tulliver and his family must live more\r\nmeagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the\r\nbusiness had paid off Furley\xe2\x80\x99s advances, and that might be while Mr\r\nTulliver had still a good many years of life before him. It was clear\r\nthat the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to\r\nturn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly\r\nan awkward moment in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor\r\nRiley, who had died suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled\r\nwith a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,\xe2\x80\x94a fact which had helped to\r\nmake Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s banking book less pleasant reading than a man might\r\ndesire toward Christmas. Well! he had never been one of those\r\npoor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a\r\nfellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really vexatious business\r\nwas the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the\r\nfive hundred pounds to repay Mrs Glegg had become uneasy about his\r\nmoney (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr Tulliver, still confident\r\nthat he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to\r\nraise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had\r\nrashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his\r\nhousehold furniture and some other effects, as security in lieu of the\r\nbond. It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off\r\nthe money, and there was no harm in giving that security any more than\r\nanother. But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him\r\nin a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at hand when\r\nit would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he\r\nwould have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing\r\nbut right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain\r\nthe thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s furniture be sold, and\r\nit might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money,\xe2\x80\x94there would,\r\nafter all, be no gift or favour in the matter. Mr Tulliver would never\r\nhave asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but\r\nBessy might do so if she liked.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most\r\nliable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden\r\nmanner; everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that\r\nthey have been thoroughly defeated, and must begin life anew. And Mr\r\nTulliver, you perceive, though nothing more than a superior miller and\r\nmaltster, was as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty\r\npersonage, in whom such dispositions might be a source of that\r\nconspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the stage in regal\r\nrobes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime. The pride and\r\nobstinacy of millers and other insignificant people, whom you pass\r\nunnoticingly on the road every day, have their tragedy too; but it is\r\nof that unwept, hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation,\r\nand leaves no record,\xe2\x80\x94such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in the conflicts\r\nof young souls, hungry for joy, under a lot made suddenly hard to them,\r\nunder the dreariness of a home where the morning brings no promise with\r\nit, and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed\r\nparents weighs on the children like a damp, thick air, in which all the\r\nfunctions of life are depressed; or such tragedy as lies in the slow or\r\nsudden death that follows on a bruised passion, though it may be a\r\ndeath that finds only a parish funeral. There are certain animals to\r\nwhich tenacity of position is a law of life,\xe2\x80\x94they can never flourish\r\nagain, after a single wrench: and there are certain human beings to\r\nwhom predominance is a law of life,\xe2\x80\x94they can only sustain humiliation\r\nso long as they can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own\r\nconception, predominate still.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver was still predominating, in his own imagination, as he\r\napproached St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, through which he had to pass on his way homeward.\r\nBut what was it that suggested to him, as he saw the Laceham coach\r\nentering the town, to follow it to the coach-office, and get the clerk\r\nthere to write a letter, requiring Maggie to come home the very next\r\nday? Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s own hand shook too much under his excitement for him\r\nto write himself, and he wanted the letter to be given to the coachman\r\nto deliver at Miss Firniss\xe2\x80\x99s school in the morning. There was a craving\r\nwhich he would not account for to himself, to have Maggie near him,\r\nwithout delay,\xe2\x80\x94she must come back by the coach to-morrow.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and\r\nscolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost,\r\nby angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about. He said\r\nnothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application to\r\nMrs Pullet, for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that\r\ntransaction, and had explained the necessity for taking an inventory of\r\nthe goods as a matter connected with his will. The possession of a wife\r\nconspicuously one\xe2\x80\x99s inferior in intellect is, like other high\r\nprivileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and, among the rest,\r\nwith the occasional necessity for using a little deception.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on\r\nhis way to Mr Gore\xe2\x80\x99s office at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Gore was to have seen Furley\r\nin the morning, and to have sounded him in relation to Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs. But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr\r\nGore\xe2\x80\x99s office, who was bringing a letter to Mr Tulliver. Mr Gore had\r\nbeen prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office\r\nto see Mr Tulliver, according to appointment, but would be at his\r\noffice at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some\r\nimportant information by letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\ntell Gore I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him to-morrow at eleven\xe2\x80\x9d; and he turned his horse.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, struck with Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s glistening, excited glance, looked\r\nafter him for a few moments, and then rode away. The reading of a\r\nletter was not the affair of an instant to Mr Tulliver; he took in the\r\nsense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or even\r\nprinted characters; so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he\r\nwould open it in his armchair at home. But by-and-by it occurred to him\r\nthat there might be something in the letter Mrs Tulliver must not know\r\nabout, and if so, it would be better to keep it out of her sight\r\naltogether. He stopped his horse, took out the letter, and read it. It\r\nwas only a short letter; the substance was, that Mr Gore had\r\nascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that Furley had been lately\r\nmuch straitened for money, and had parted with his securities,\xe2\x80\x94among\r\nthe rest, the mortgage on Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s property, which he had\r\ntransferred to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Wakem.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour after this Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s own wagoner found him lying by\r\nthe roadside insensible, with an open letter near him, and his gray\r\nhorse snuffing uneasily about him.\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncall, he was no longer insensible. About an hour before he had become\r\nconscious, and after vague, vacant looks around him, had muttered\r\nsomething about \xe2\x80\x9ca letter,\xe2\x80\x9d which he presently repeated impatiently. At\r\nthe instance of Mr Turnbull, the medical man, Gore\xe2\x80\x99s letter was brought\r\nand laid on the bed, and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed.\r\nThe stricken man lay for some time with his eyes fixed on the letter,\r\nas if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help. But presently\r\na new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away; he\r\nturned his eyes from the letter to the door, and after looking\r\nuneasily, as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim for, he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThe little wench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing entirely\r\nunconscious of everything except this one importunate want, and giving\r\nno sign of knowing his wife or any one else; and poor Mrs Tulliver, her\r\nfeeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of\r\ntroubles, went backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham\r\ncoach were coming, though it was not yet time.\r\n\r\nBut it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle wench,\xe2\x80\x9d except to her father\xe2\x80\x99s fond memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie said, with pale lips, as her\r\nmother came toward her crying. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t think her father was ill,\r\nbecause the letter had come at his dictation from the office at St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel\r\nof the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom\r\nshe remembered as long as she could remember anything, with a\r\ntrembling, questioning look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself too much, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father has had a sudden attack, and has not quite recovered his\r\nmemory. But he has been asking for you, and it will do him good to see\r\nyou. Keep as quiet as you can; take off your things, and come upstairs\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie obeyed, with that terrible beating of the heart which makes\r\nexistence seem simply a painful pulsation. The very quietness with\r\nwhich Mr Turnbull spoke had frightened her susceptible imagination. Her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she\r\nentered and met the strange, yearning, helpless look that had been\r\nseeking her in vain. With a sudden flash and movement, he raised\r\nhimself in the bed; she rushed toward him, and clasped him with\r\nagonised kisses.\r\n\r\nPoor child! it was very early for her to know one of those supreme\r\nmoments in life when all we have hoped or delighted in, all we can\r\ndread or endure, falls away from our regard as insignificant; is lost,\r\nlike a trivial memory, in that simple, primitive love which knits us to\r\nthe beings who have been nearest to us, in their times of helplessness\r\nor of anguish.\r\n\r\nBut that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bruised, enfeebled powers. He sank back again in renewed\r\ninsensibility and rigidity, which lasted for many hours, and was only\r\nbroken by a flickering return of consciousness, in which he took\r\npassively everything that was given to him, and seemed to have a sort\r\nof infantine satisfaction in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s near presence,\xe2\x80\x94such satisfaction\r\nas a baby has when it is returned to the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver sent for her sisters, and there was much wailing and\r\nlifting up of hands below stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the\r\nruin of Bessy and her family was as complete as they had ever foreboded\r\nit, and there was a general family sense that a judgment had fallen on\r\nMr Tulliver, which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much\r\nkindness. But Maggie heard little of this, scarcely ever leaving her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bedside, where she sat opposite him with her hand on his. Mrs\r\nTulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed to be thinking\r\nmore of her boy even than of her husband; but the aunts and uncles\r\nopposed this. Tom was better at school, since Mr Turnbull said there\r\nwas no immediate danger, he believed. But at the end of the second day,\r\nwhen Maggie had become more accustomed to her father\xe2\x80\x99s fits of\r\ninsensibility, and to the expectation that he would revive from them,\r\nthe thought of Tom had become urgent with _her_ too; and when her\r\nmother sate crying at night and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor lad\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but\r\nright he should come home,\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go for him, and tell\r\nhim, mother; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to-morrow morning if father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know me and\r\nwant me. It would be so hard for Tom to come home and not know anything\r\nabout it beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the next morning Maggie went, as we have seen. Sitting on the coach\r\non their way home, the brother and sister talked to each other in sad,\r\ninterrupted whispers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say Mr Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the letter with that news in it that made father\r\nill, they think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s been planning all along to ruin my father,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tom, leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite\r\nconclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make him feel for it when I\xe2\x80\x99m a man. Mind you never\r\nspeak to Philip again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a tone of sad remonstrance; but she had no\r\nspirit to dispute anything then, still less to vex Tom by opposing him.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s Teraphim, or Household Gods\r\n\r\nWhen the coach set down Tom and Maggie, it was five hours since she had\r\nstarted from home, and she was thinking with some trembling that her\r\nfather had perhaps missed her, and asked for \xe2\x80\x9cthe little wench\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nvain. She thought of no other change that might have happened.\r\n\r\nShe hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom; but\r\nin the entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The\r\nparlour door was ajar; that was where the smell came from. It was very\r\nstrange; could any visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her\r\nmother there? If so, she must be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after\r\nthis pause of surprise, was only in the act of opening the door when\r\nTom came up, and they both looked into the parlour together.\r\n\r\nThere was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague\r\nrecollection, sitting in his father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, smoking, with a jug and\r\nglass beside him.\r\n\r\nThe truth flashed on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind in an instant. To \xe2\x80\x9chave the bailiff in\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto be sold up,\xe2\x80\x9d were phrases which he had been used\r\nto, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfailing,\xe2\x80\x9d of losing all one\xe2\x80\x99s money, and being ruined,\xe2\x80\x94sinking into\r\nthe condition of poor working people. It seemed only natural this\r\nshould happen, since his father had lost all his property, and he\r\nthought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune\r\nthan the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of this\r\ndisgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of\r\napprehension, that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had\r\nonly just begun: it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with\r\nits spontaneous dull aching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, taking the pipe out of his mouth,\r\nwith rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made him\r\na little uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nBut Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too\r\nhateful. Maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger, as\r\nTom had. She followed him, whispering: \xe2\x80\x9cWho can it be, Tom? What is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d Then, with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might\r\nhave something to do with a change in her father, she rushed upstairs,\r\nchecking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her bonnet, and enter\r\non tiptoe. All was silent there; her father was lying, heedless of\r\neverything around him, with his eyes closed as when she had left him. A\r\nservant was there, but not her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. The servant did not know.\r\n\r\nMaggie hastened out, and said to Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cFather is lying quiet; let us go\r\nand look for my mother. I wonder where she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There was\r\nbut one room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it was\r\nthe storeroom, where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbest things\xe2\x80\x9d that were only unwrapped and brought out on special\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nTom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the\r\ndoor of this room, and immediately said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was seated there with all her laid-up treasures. One of\r\nthe linen chests was open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its\r\nmany folds of paper, and the best china was laid out on the top of the\r\nclosed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows\r\non the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping,\r\nwith a bitter tension of the mouth, over the mark, \xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth Dodson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\non the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap.\r\n\r\nShe dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my boy, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clasping him round the neck. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think\r\nas I should live to see this day! We\xe2\x80\x99re ruined\xe2\x80\x94everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\r\nsold up\xe2\x80\x94to think as your father should ha\xe2\x80\x99 married me to bring me to\r\nthis! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\xe2\x80\x94we shall be beggars\xe2\x80\x94we must go to the\r\nworkhouse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kissed him, then seated herself again, and took another tablecloth\r\non her lap, unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern, while the\r\nchildren stood by in mute wretchedness, their minds quite filled for\r\nthe moment with the words \xe2\x80\x9cbeggars\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworkhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think o\xe2\x80\x99 these cloths as I spun myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, lifting\r\nthings out and turning them over with an excitement all the more\r\nstrange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so\r\npassive,\xe2\x80\x94if she had been ruffled before, it was at the surface\r\nmerely,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand Job Haxey wove \xe2\x80\x99em, and brought the piece home on his\r\nback, as I remember standing at the door and seeing him come, before I\r\never thought o\xe2\x80\x99 marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose\r\nmyself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked \xe2\x80\x99em so as nobody ever\r\nsaw such marking,\xe2\x80\x94they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nparticular stitch. And they\xe2\x80\x99re all to be sold, and go into strange\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out\r\nbefore I\xe2\x80\x99m dead. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never have one of \xe2\x80\x99em, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nlooking up at Tom with her eyes full of tears, \xe2\x80\x9cand I meant \xe2\x80\x99em for\r\nyou. I wanted you to have all o\xe2\x80\x99 this pattern. Maggie could have had\r\nthe large check\xe2\x80\x94it never shows so well when the dishes are on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction\r\nimmediately. His face flushed as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it?\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll never let your linen go, will they? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you sent to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I sent Luke directly they\xe2\x80\x99d put the bailies in, and your aunt\r\nPullet\xe2\x80\x99s been\xe2\x80\x94and, oh dear, oh dear, she cries so and says your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s disgraced my family and made it the talk o\xe2\x80\x99 the country; and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll buy the spotted cloths for herself, because she\xe2\x80\x99s never had so\r\nmany as she wanted o\xe2\x80\x99 that pattern, and they sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go to strangers,\r\nbut she\xe2\x80\x99s got more checks a\xe2\x80\x99ready nor she can do with.\xe2\x80\x9d (Here Mrs\r\nTulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the chest, folding and\r\nstroking them automatically.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s been too, and he\r\nsays things must be bought in for us to lie down on, but he must talk\r\nto your aunt; and they\xe2\x80\x99re all coming to consult. But I know they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnone of \xe2\x80\x99em take my chany,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning toward the cups and\r\nsaucers, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they all found fault with \xe2\x80\x99em when I bought \xe2\x80\x99em, \xe2\x80\x99cause\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the small gold sprig all over \xe2\x80\x99em, between the flowers. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnone of \xe2\x80\x99em got better chany, not even your aunt Pullet herself; and I\r\nbought it wi\xe2\x80\x99 my own money as I\xe2\x80\x99d saved ever since I was turned\r\nfifteen; and the silver teapot, too,\xe2\x80\x94your father never paid for \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nAnd to think as he should ha\xe2\x80\x99 married me, and brought me to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she sobbed with her\r\nhandkerchief at her eyes a few moments, but then removing it, she said\r\nin a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she were called upon to\r\nspeak before she could command her voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I _did_ say to him times and times, \xe2\x80\x98Whativer you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t go to\r\nlaw,\xe2\x80\x99 and what more could I do? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to sit by while my own\r\nfortin\xe2\x80\x99s been spent, and what should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been my children\xe2\x80\x99s, too.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have niver a penny, my boy\xe2\x80\x94but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t your poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out one arm toward Tom, looking up at him piteously with her\r\nhelpless, childish blue eyes. The poor lad went to her and kissed her,\r\nand she clung to him. For the first time Tom thought of his father with\r\nsome reproach. His natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept entirely\r\nin abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always\r\nright, simply on the ground that he was Tom Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s father, was\r\nturned into this new channel by his mother\xe2\x80\x99s plaints; and with his\r\nindignation against Wakem there began to mingle some indignation of\r\nanother sort. Perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all\r\ndown in the world, and making people talk of them with contempt, but no\r\none should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt.\r\n\r\nThe natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert\r\nitself, urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts,\r\nand the sense that he must behave like a man and take care of his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fret, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be able to get\r\nmoney; I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a situation of some sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, a little soothed. Then, looking\r\nround sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 minded so much if we could ha\xe2\x80\x99 kept\r\nthe things wi\xe2\x80\x99 my name on \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger. The implied\r\nreproaches against her father\xe2\x80\x94her father, who was lying there in a sort\r\nof living death\xe2\x80\x94neutralised all her pity for griefs about tablecloths\r\nand china; and her anger on her father\xe2\x80\x99s account was heightened by some\r\negoistic resentment at Tom\xe2\x80\x99s silent concurrence with her mother in\r\nshutting her out from the common calamity. She had become almost\r\nindifferent to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s habitual depreciation of her, but she was\r\nkeenly alive to any sanction of it, however passive, that she might\r\nsuspect in Tom. Poor Maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed\r\ndevotedness, but put forth large claims for herself where she loved\r\nstrongly. She burst out at last in an agitated, almost violent tone:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for things with\r\n_your_ name on, and not for what has my father\xe2\x80\x99s name too; and to care\r\nabout anything but dear father himself!\xe2\x80\x94when he\xe2\x80\x99s lying there, and may\r\nnever speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too; you ought not to\r\nlet any one find fault with my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and\r\ntook her old place on her father\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Her heart went out to him with\r\na stronger movement than ever, at the thought that people would blame\r\nhim. Maggie hated blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing\r\nhad come of it but evil tempers.\r\n\r\nHer father had always defended and excused her, and her loving\r\nremembrance of his tenderness was a force within her that would enable\r\nher to do or bear anything for his sake.\r\n\r\nTom was a little shocked at Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s outburst,\xe2\x80\x94telling _him_ as well as\r\nhis mother what it was right to do! She ought to have learned better\r\nthan have those hectoring, assuming manners, by this time. But he\r\npresently went into his father\xe2\x80\x99s room, and the sight there touched him\r\nin a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour.\r\nWhen Maggie saw how he was moved, she went to him and put her arm round\r\nhis neck as he sat by the bed, and the two children forgot everything\r\nelse in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nThe Family Council\r\n\r\nIt was at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles\r\ncame to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large\r\nparlour, and poor Mrs Tulliver, with a confused impression that it was\r\na great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and\r\nunpinned the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking round\r\nand shaking her head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the tables,\r\nwhich sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nMr Deane was not coming, he was away on business; but Mrs Deane\r\nappeared punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it, and\r\nthe livery-servant driving it, which had thrown so clear a light on\r\nseveral traits in her character to some of her female friends in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr Deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as Mr\r\nTulliver had been going down in it; and in Mrs Deane\xe2\x80\x99s house the Dodson\r\nlinen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate position, as\r\na mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same kind, purchased\r\nin recent years,\xe2\x80\x94a change which had caused an occasional coolness in\r\nthe sisterly intercourse between her and Mrs Glegg, who felt that Susan\r\nwas getting \xe2\x80\x9clike the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d and there would soon be little of the true\r\nDodson spirit surviving except in herself, and, it might be hoped, in\r\nthose nephews who supported the Dodson name on the family land, far\r\naway in the Wolds.\r\n\r\nPeople who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those\r\nimmediately under our own eyes; and it seems superfluous, when we\r\nconsider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians, and how\r\nvery little the Greeks had to do with them, to inquire further why\r\nHomer calls them \xe2\x80\x9cblameless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Deane was the first to arrive; and when she had taken her seat in\r\nthe large parlour, Mrs Tulliver came down to her with her comely face a\r\nlittle distorted, nearly as it would have been if she had been crying.\r\nShe was not a woman who could shed abundant tears, except in moments\r\nwhen the prospect of losing her furniture became unusually vivid, but\r\nshe felt how unfitting it was to be quite calm under present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sister, what a world this is!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed as she entered; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ntrouble, oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Deane was a thin-lipped woman, who made small well-considered\r\nspeeches on peculiar occasions, repeating them afterward to her\r\nhusband, and asking him if she had not spoken very properly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she said deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a changing world, and we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know to-day what may happen tomorrow. But it\xe2\x80\x99s right to be\r\nprepared for all things, and if trouble\xe2\x80\x99s sent, to remember as it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsent without a cause. I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for you as a sister, and if the\r\ndoctor orders jelly for Mr Tulliver, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me know. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsend it willingly; for it is but right he should have proper attendance\r\nwhile he\xe2\x80\x99s ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, rather faintly, withdrawing her\r\nfat hand from her sister\xe2\x80\x99s thin one. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s been no talk o\xe2\x80\x99 jelly\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d Then after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause she added, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a dozen o\xe2\x80\x99 cut\r\njelly-glasses upstairs\xe2\x80\x94I shall never put jelly into \xe2\x80\x99em no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words, but the\r\nsound of wheels diverted her thoughts. Mr and Mrs Glegg were come, and\r\nwere almost immediately followed by Mr and Mrs Pullet.\r\n\r\nMrs Pullet entered crying, as a compendious mode, at all times, of\r\nexpressing what were her views of life in general, and what, in brief,\r\nwere the opinions she held concerning the particular case before her.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg had on her fuzziest front, and garments which appeared to\r\nhave had a recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial; a\r\ncostume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect\r\nhumility into Bessy and her children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs G., won\xe2\x80\x99t you come nearer the fire?\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, unwilling\r\nto take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I\xe2\x80\x99ve seated myself here, Mr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d returned this superior\r\nwoman; \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ can roast yourself, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, seating himself good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cand how\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npoor man upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr Turnbull thought him a deal better this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver; \xe2\x80\x9che took more notice, and spoke to me; but he\xe2\x80\x99s never known\r\nTom yet,\xe2\x80\x94looks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger, though he said\r\nsomething once about Tom and the pony. The doctor says his memory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone a long way back, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know Tom because he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of\r\nhim when he was little. Eh dear, eh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s the water got on his brain,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, turning\r\nround from adjusting her cap in a melancholy way at the pier-glass.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much if he ever gets up again; and if he does, he\xe2\x80\x99ll most like be\r\nchildish, as Mr Carr was, poor man! They fed him with a spoon as if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d been a babby for three year. He\xe2\x80\x99d quite lost the use of his limbs;\r\nbut then he\xe2\x80\x99d got a Bath chair, and somebody to draw him; and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you won\xe2\x80\x99t have, I doubt, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cif I understand right,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve come together this morning to advise and consult about what\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbe done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family, and not to talk\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 people as don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to us. Mr Carr was none of our blood, nor\r\nnoways connected with us, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, in a pleading tone, drawing on her\r\ngloves again, and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything disrespectful to say o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Carr, I do beg of you as\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t say it to me. _I_ know what he was,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sigh;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chis breath was short to that degree as you could hear him two rooms\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, with indignant disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _do_ talk o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s complaints till it\xe2\x80\x99s quite undecent. But I say again, as I\r\nsaid before, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come away from home to talk about acquaintances,\r\nwhether they\xe2\x80\x99d short breath or long. If we aren\xe2\x80\x99t come together for one\r\nto hear what the other \xe2\x80\x99ull do to save a sister and her children from\r\nthe parish, _I_ shall go back. _One_ can\xe2\x80\x99t act without the other, I\r\nsuppose; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be expected as _I_ should do everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so very\r\nforrard at doing. So far as I know, this is the first time as here\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been, since it\xe2\x80\x99s been known as the bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s in the house; and I\r\nwas here yesterday, and looked at all Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s linen and things, and I\r\ntold her I\xe2\x80\x99d buy in the spotted tablecloths. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak fairer;\r\nfor as for the teapot as she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out o\xe2\x80\x99 the family, it\r\nstands to sense I can\xe2\x80\x99t do with two silver teapots, not if it _hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\na straight spout, but the spotted damask I was allays fond on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best\r\ncastors needn\xe2\x80\x99t be put up for sale,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs Tulliver,\r\nbeseechingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand the sugar-tongs the first things ever I bought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfamily chooses to buy \xe2\x80\x99em in, they can, but one thing must be bid for\r\nas well as another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be looked for,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet, with unwonted\r\nindependence of idea, \xe2\x80\x9cas your own family should pay more for things\r\nnor they\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch. They may go for an old song by auction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cto think o\xe2\x80\x99 my chany being sold\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 that way, and I bought it when I was married, just as you did yours,\r\nJane and Sophy; and I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like mine, because o\xe2\x80\x99 the sprig,\r\nbut I was fond of it; and there\xe2\x80\x99s never been a bit broke, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwashed it myself; and there\xe2\x80\x99s the tulips on the cups, and the roses, as\r\nanybody might go and look at \xe2\x80\x99em for pleasure. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like _your_\r\nchany to go for an old song and be broke to pieces, though yours has\r\ngot no colour in it, Jane,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all white and fluted, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost\r\nso much as mine. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the castors, sister Deane, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have the castors, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\npretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection to buy some of the best things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nDeane, rather loftily; \xe2\x80\x9cwe can do with extra things in our house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBest things!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Glegg, with severity, which had gathered\r\nintensity from her long silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt drives me past patience to hear\r\nyou all talking o\xe2\x80\x99 best things, and buying in this, that, and the\r\nother, such as silver and chany. You must bring your mind to your\r\ncircumstances, Bessy, and not be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 silver and chany; but\r\nwhether you shall get so much as a flock-bed to lie on, and a blanket\r\nto cover you, and a stool to sit on. You must remember, if you get \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll be because your friends have bought \xe2\x80\x99em for you, for you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndependent upon _them_ for everything; for your husband lies there\r\nhelpless, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a penny i\xe2\x80\x99 the world to call his own. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor your own good I say this, for it\xe2\x80\x99s right you should feel what your\r\nstate is, and what disgrace your husband\xe2\x80\x99s brought on your own family,\r\nas you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look to for everything, and be humble in your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg paused, for speaking with much energy for the good of others\r\nis naturally exhausting.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver, always borne down by the family predominance of sister\r\nJane, who had made her wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender\r\nyears, said pleadingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sister, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked anybody to do anything, only buy\r\nthings as it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a pleasure to \xe2\x80\x99em to have, so as they mightn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nand be spoiled i\xe2\x80\x99 strange houses. I never asked anybody to buy the\r\nthings in for me and my children; though there\xe2\x80\x99s the linen I spun, and\r\nI thought when Tom was born,\xe2\x80\x94I thought one o\xe2\x80\x99 the first things when he\r\nwas lying i\xe2\x80\x99 the cradle, as all the things I\xe2\x80\x99d bought wi\xe2\x80\x99 my own money,\r\nand been so careful of, \xe2\x80\x99ud go to him. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve said nothing as I\r\nwanted my sisters to pay their money for me. What my husband has done\r\nfor _his_ sister\xe2\x80\x99s unknown, and we should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been better off this day\r\nif it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been as he\xe2\x80\x99s lent money and never asked for it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t let us make things too\r\ndark. What\xe2\x80\x99s done can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone. We shall make a shift among us to\r\nbuy what\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient for you; though, as Mrs G. says, they must be\r\nuseful, plain things. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary. A\r\ntable, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and a good bed, and\r\nsuch-like. Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the day when I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 known myself if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d lain on sacking i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 the floor. We get a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 useless\r\nthings about us, only because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the money to spend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs G., \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll be kind enough to let me speak,\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 taking the words out o\xe2\x80\x99 my mouth,\xe2\x80\x94I was going to say, Bessy,\r\nas it\xe2\x80\x99s fine talking for you to say as you\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked us to buy\r\nanything for you; let me tell you, you _ought_ to have asked us. Pray,\r\nhow are you to be purvided for, if your own family don\xe2\x80\x99t help you? You\r\nmust go to the parish, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And you ought to know that, and\r\nkeep it in mind, and ask us humble to do what we can for you, i\xe2\x80\x99stead\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 saying, and making a boast, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked us for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talked o\xe2\x80\x99 the Mosses, and what Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s done for \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nuncle Pullet, who became unusually suggestive where advances of money\r\nwere concerned. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t _they_ been anear you? They ought to do\r\nsomething as well as other folks; and if he\xe2\x80\x99s lent \xe2\x80\x99em money, they\r\nought to be made to pay it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Deane; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking so. How is it Mr\r\nand Mrs Moss aren\xe2\x80\x99t here to meet us? It is but right they should do\r\ntheir share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cI never sent \xe2\x80\x99em word about Mr\r\nTulliver, and they live so back\xe2\x80\x99ard among the lanes at Basset, they\r\nniver hear anything only when Mr Moss comes to market. But I niver gave\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em a thought. I wonder Maggie didn\xe2\x80\x99t, though, for she was allays so\r\nfond of her aunt Moss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t your children come in, Bessy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, at the\r\nmention of Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should hear what their aunts and uncles have\r\ngot to say; and Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94when it\xe2\x80\x99s me as have paid for half her\r\nschooling, she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt\r\nMoss. I may go off sudden when I get home to-day; there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d had _my_ way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cthe children \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been in\r\nthe room from the first. It\xe2\x80\x99s time they knew who they\xe2\x80\x99ve to look to,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s right as _somebody_ should talk to \xe2\x80\x99em, and let \xe2\x80\x99em know their\r\ncondition i\xe2\x80\x99 life, and what they\xe2\x80\x99re come down to, and make \xe2\x80\x99em feel as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got to suffer for their father\xe2\x80\x99s faults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch \xe2\x80\x99em, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, resignedly.\r\nShe was quite crushed now, and thought of the treasures in the\r\nstoreroom with no other feeling than blank despair.\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s room, and was on her way down again, when the sight of the\r\nstoreroom door suggested a new thought to her. She went toward it, and\r\nleft the children to go down by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the\r\nbrother and sister entered,\xe2\x80\x94both with shrinking reluctance; for though\r\nTom, with a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by\r\nthe strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since\r\nyesterday, had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to\r\npropose to one of his aunts or uncles, he felt by no means amicably\r\ntoward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would have\r\ndreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just\r\nendurable in small draughts. As for Maggie, she was peculiarly\r\ndepressed this morning; she had been called up, after brief rest, at\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from\r\nwatching in a sick-room through the chill hours of early twilight and\r\nbreaking day,\xe2\x80\x94in which the outside day-light life seems to have no\r\nimportance, and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened\r\nchamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation. The shaking of\r\nhands was a melancholy and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet observed,\r\nas Tom approached him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking as we should want your pen and\r\nink; you can write rarely now, after all your schooling, I should\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he meant to be kind,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe must look to see the good of all this schooling, as your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsunk so much money in, now,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98When land is gone and money\xe2\x80\x99s spent,\r\n     Then learning is most excellent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nNow\xe2\x80\x99s the time, Tom, to let us see the good o\xe2\x80\x99 your learning. Let us\r\nsee whether you can do better than I can, as have made my fortin\r\nwithout it. But I began wi\xe2\x80\x99 doing with little, you see; I could live on\r\na basin o\xe2\x80\x99 porridge and a crust o\xe2\x80\x99 bread-and-cheese. But I doubt high\r\nliving and high learning \xe2\x80\x99ull make it harder for you, young man, nor it\r\nwas for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he must do it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed aunt Glegg, energetically, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s hard or no. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got to consider what\xe2\x80\x99s hard; he must\r\nconsider as he isn\xe2\x80\x99t to trusten to his friends to keep him in idleness\r\nand luxury; he\xe2\x80\x99s got to bear the fruits of his father\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, and\r\nbring his mind to fare hard and to work hard. And he must be humble and\r\ngrateful to his aunts and uncles for what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing for his mother\r\nand father, as must be turned out into the streets and go to the\r\nworkhouse if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t help \xe2\x80\x99em. And his sister, too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs\r\nGlegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on the sofa by her\r\naunt Deane, drawn to her by the sense that she was Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\nmust make up her mind to be humble and work; for there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no\r\nservants to wait on her any more,\xe2\x80\x94she must remember that. She must do\r\nthe work o\xe2\x80\x99 the house, and she must respect and love her aunts as have\r\ndone so much for her, and saved their money to leave to their nepheys\r\nand nieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group.\r\nThere was a heightened colour in his face, and he was very far from\r\nlooking humbled, but he was preparing to say, in a respectful tone,\r\nsomething he had previously meditated, when the door opened and his\r\nmother re-entered.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Tulliver had in her hands a small tray, on which she had\r\nplaced her silver teapot, a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors,\r\nand sugar-tongs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at Mrs Deane, as she set the tray\r\non the table, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, perhaps, if you looked at the teapot\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a good while since you saw it,\xe2\x80\x94you might like the pattern\r\nbetter; it makes beautiful tea, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a stand and everything; you\r\nmight use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to\r\nhousekeeping. I should be so loath for \xe2\x80\x99em to buy it at the Golden\r\nLion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its\r\nbeing scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my\r\nletters on it,\xe2\x80\x94see here, E. D.,\xe2\x80\x94and everybody to see \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, shaking her head with deep sadness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very bad,\xe2\x80\x94to think o\xe2\x80\x99 the family initials going about\r\neverywhere\xe2\x80\x94it niver was so before; you\xe2\x80\x99re a very unlucky sister, Bessy.\r\nBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 buying the teapot, when there\xe2\x80\x99s the linen and\r\nspoons and everything to go, and some of \xe2\x80\x99em with your full name,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s got that straight spout, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to disgrace o\xe2\x80\x99 the family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cthat can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 buying teapots. The disgrace is, for one o\xe2\x80\x99 the family to ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarried a man as has brought her to beggary. The disgrace is, as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re to be sold up. We can\xe2\x80\x99t hinder the country from knowing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father, but\r\nTom saw her action and flushed face in time to prevent her from\r\nspeaking. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said authoritatively, pushing her\r\naside. It was a remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical\r\njudgment in a lad of fifteen, that when his aunt Glegg ceased, he began\r\nto speak in a quiet and respectful manner, though with a good deal of\r\ntrembling in his voice; for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s words had cut him to the\r\nquick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking straight at Mrs Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be\r\nbetter to prevent it altogether? And if you and aunt Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, looking at the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cthink of leaving any money to me and\r\nMaggie, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better to give it now, and pay the debt we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with her\r\nfurniture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie,\r\nwas astonished at Tom\xe2\x80\x99s sudden manliness of tone. Uncle Glegg was the\r\nfirst to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, young man, come now! You show some notion o\xe2\x80\x99 things. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the interest, you must remember; your aunts get five per cent\r\non their money, and they\xe2\x80\x99d lose that if they advanced it; you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthought o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could work and pay that every year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nanything to save my mother from parting with her things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Glegg, admiringly. He had been drawing Tom out,\r\nrather than reflecting on the practicability of his proposal. But he\r\nhad produced the unfortunate result of irritating his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr Glegg!\xe2\x80\x9d said that lady, with angry sarcasm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant\r\nwork for you to be giving my money away, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve pretended to leave\r\nat my own disposal. And my money, as was my own father\xe2\x80\x99s gift, and not\r\nyours, Mr Glegg; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved it, and added to it myself, and had\r\nmore to put out almost every year, and it\xe2\x80\x99s to go and be sunk in other\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 furniture, and encourage \xe2\x80\x99em in luxury and extravagance as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve no means of supporting; and I\xe2\x80\x99m to alter my will, or have a\r\ncodicil made, and leave two or three hundred less behind me when I\r\ndie,\xe2\x80\x94me as have allays done right and been careful, and the eldest o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe family; and my money\xe2\x80\x99s to go and be squandered on them as have had\r\nthe same chance as me, only they\xe2\x80\x99ve been wicked and wasteful. Sister\r\nPullet, _you_ may do as you like, and you may let your husband rob you\r\nback again o\xe2\x80\x99 the money he\xe2\x80\x99s given you, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t _my_ sperrit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, Jane, how fiery you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nthe blood in your head, and have to be cupped. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for Bessy and\r\nher children,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I think of \xe2\x80\x99em o\xe2\x80\x99 nights dreadful, for I sleep\r\nvery bad wi\xe2\x80\x99 this new medicine,\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s no use for me to think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoing anything, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t meet me half-way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s this to be considered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use to\r\npay off this debt and save the furniture, when there\xe2\x80\x99s all the law\r\ndebts behind, as \xe2\x80\x99ud take every shilling, and more than could be made\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 land and stock, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve made that out from Lawyer Gore. We\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nneed save our money to keep the poor man with, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 spending it\r\non furniture as he can neither eat nor drink. You _will_ be so hasty,\r\nJane, as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen speak accordingly, Mr Glegg!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, with slow, loud\r\nemphasis, bending her head toward him significantly.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s countenance had fallen during this conversation, and his lip\r\nquivered; but he was determined not to give way. He would behave like a\r\nman. Maggie, on the contrary, after her momentary delight in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech, had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation. Her\r\nmother had been standing close by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s side, and had been clinging to\r\nhis arm ever since he had last spoken; Maggie suddenly started up and\r\nstood in front of them, her eyes flashing like the eyes of a young\r\nlioness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you come, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, \xe2\x80\x9ctalking and interfering with\r\nus and scolding us, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do anything to help my poor\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94your own sister,\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no feeling for her when she\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\ntrouble, and won\xe2\x80\x99t part with anything, though you would never miss it,\r\nto save her from pain? Keep away from us then, and don\xe2\x80\x99t come to find\r\nfault with my father,\xe2\x80\x94he was better than any of you; he was kind,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwould have helped _you_, if you had been in trouble. Tom and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\never want to have any of your money, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t help my mother. We\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather not have it! We\xe2\x80\x99ll do without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way,\r\nstood still, with her large dark eyes glaring at them, as if she were\r\nready to await all consequences.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver was frightened; there was something portentous in this mad\r\noutbreak; she did not see how life could go on after it. Tom was vexed;\r\nit was no _use_ to talk so. The aunts were silent with surprise for\r\nsome moments. At length, in a case of aberration such as this, comment\r\npresented itself as more expedient than any answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the end o\xe2\x80\x99 your trouble wi\xe2\x80\x99 that child, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Pullet; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful. I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 let alone paying for her schooling, for\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s worse nor ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no more than what I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays said,\xe2\x80\x9d followed Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cOther\r\nfolks may be surprised, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said over and over\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x94years ago I\xe2\x80\x99ve said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Mark my words; that child \xe2\x80\x99ull come to no\r\ngood; there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit of our family in her.\xe2\x80\x99 And as for her having so\r\nmuch schooling, I never thought well o\xe2\x80\x99 that. I\xe2\x80\x99d my reasons when I\r\nsaid _I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay anything toward it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s waste no more time in\r\ntalking,\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s go to business. Tom, now, get the pen and ink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Glegg was speaking, a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Moss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bad news must ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreached her, then\xe2\x80\x9d; and she went out to open the door, Maggie eagerly\r\nfollowing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can agree to the list o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings to be bought in. It\xe2\x80\x99s but right she should do her share when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s her own brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Moss was in too much agitation to resist Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s movement,\r\nas she drew her into the parlour automatically, without reflecting that\r\nit was hardly kind to take her among so many persons in the first\r\npainful moment of arrival. The tall, worn, dark-haired woman was a\r\nstrong contrast to the Dodson sisters as she entered in her shabby\r\ndress, with her shawl and bonnet looking as if they had been hastily\r\nhuddled on, and with that entire absence of self-consciousness which\r\nbelongs to keenly felt trouble. Maggie was clinging to her arm; and Mrs\r\nMoss seemed to notice no one else except Tom, whom she went straight up\r\nto and took by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear children,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to think well o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme; I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor aunt to you, for I\xe2\x80\x99m one o\xe2\x80\x99 them as take all and give\r\nnothing. How\xe2\x80\x99s my poor brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Turnbull thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll get better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down, aunt\r\nGritty. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my sweet child, I feel torn i\xe2\x80\x99 two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, allowing\r\nMaggie to lead her to the sofa, but still not seeming to notice the\r\npresence of the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve three hundred pounds o\xe2\x80\x99 my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney, and now he wants it, and you all want it, poor things!\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nwe must be sold up to pay it, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my poor children,\xe2\x80\x94eight of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, and the little un of all can\xe2\x80\x99t speak plain. And I feel as if I was\r\na robber. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d no thought as my brother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred pounds! oh dear, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, who, when she\r\nhad said that her husband had done \xe2\x80\x9cunknown\xe2\x80\x9d things for his sister, had\r\nnot had any particular sum in her mind, and felt a wife\xe2\x80\x99s irritation at\r\nhaving been kept in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat madness, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cA man with a family! He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nno right to lend his money i\xe2\x80\x99 that way; and without security, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound, if the truth was known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s voice had arrested Mrs Moss\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and looking up,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there _was_ security; my husband gave a note for it. We\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nthat sort o\xe2\x80\x99 people, neither of us, as \xe2\x80\x99ud rob my brother\xe2\x80\x99s children;\r\nand we looked to paying back the money, when the times got a bit\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, gently, \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t your husband no way o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nraising this money? Because it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a little fortin, like, for these\r\nfolks, if we can do without Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s being made a bankrupt. Your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s got stock; it is but right he should raise the money, as it\r\nseems to me,\xe2\x80\x94not but what I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you, Mrs Moss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what bad luck my husband\xe2\x80\x99s had with his stock.\r\nThe farm\xe2\x80\x99s suffering so as never was for want o\xe2\x80\x99 stock; and we\xe2\x80\x99ve sold\r\nall the wheat, and we\xe2\x80\x99re behind with our rent,\xe2\x80\x94not but what we\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto do what\xe2\x80\x99s right, and I\xe2\x80\x99d sit up and work half the night, if it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe any good; but there\xe2\x80\x99s them poor children,\xe2\x80\x94four of \xe2\x80\x99em such little\r\nuns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry so, aunt; don\xe2\x80\x99t fret,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Maggie, who had kept hold\r\nof Mrs Moss\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr Tulliver let you have the money all at once?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, still lost in the conception of things which had been \xe2\x80\x9cgoing\r\non\xe2\x80\x9d without her knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; at twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, rubbing her eyes and making an effort to\r\nrestrain her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last was after my bad illness four years ago,\r\nas everything went wrong, and there was a new note made then. What with\r\nillness and bad luck, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been nothing but cumber all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs Moss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, with decision, \xe2\x80\x9cyours is a very\r\nunlucky family; the more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity for _my_ sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o\xe2\x80\x99 what had happened,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Moss, looking at Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI should never ha\xe2\x80\x99 stayed away\r\nall this while, if you\xe2\x80\x99d thought well to let me know. And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking all about ourselves, and nothing about my brother, only\r\nthe money was so on my mind, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help speaking about it. And my\r\nhusband and me desire to do the right thing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking\r\nat Mr Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll make shift and pay the money, come what will,\r\nif that\xe2\x80\x99s all my brother\xe2\x80\x99s got to trust to. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to trouble,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t look for much else. It\xe2\x80\x99s only the thought o\xe2\x80\x99 my poor children\r\npulls me i\xe2\x80\x99 two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s this to be thought on, Mrs Moss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s right to warn you,\xe2\x80\x94if Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s made a bankrupt, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\nnote-of-hand of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s for three hundred pounds, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nobliged to pay it; th\xe2\x80\x99 assignees \xe2\x80\x99ull come on you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, thinking of the bankruptcy, and\r\nnot of Mrs Moss\xe2\x80\x99s concern in it. Poor Mrs Moss herself listened in\r\ntrembling submission, while Maggie looked with bewildered distress at\r\nTom to see if _he_ showed any signs of understanding this trouble, and\r\ncaring about poor aunt Moss. Tom was only looking thoughtful, with his\r\neyes on the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t made bankrupt,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cas I said before,\r\nthree hundred pounds \xe2\x80\x99ud be a little fortin for him, poor man. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow but what he may be partly helpless, if he ever gets up again. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nvery sorry if it goes hard with you, Mrs Moss, but my opinion is,\r\nlooking at it one way, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be right for you to raise the money; and\r\nlooking at it th\xe2\x80\x99 other way, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be obliged to pay it. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink ill o\xe2\x80\x99 me for speaking the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking up suddenly from his meditative view of the\r\ntablecloth, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be right for my aunt Moss to pay\r\nthe money if it would be against my father\xe2\x80\x99s will for her to pay it;\r\nwould it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\r\nperhaps not, Tom; but then he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 destroyed the note, you know. We\r\nmust look for the note. What makes you think it \xe2\x80\x99ud be against his\r\nwill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, colouring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of a\r\nboyish tremor, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember quite well, before I went to school to Mr\r\nStelling, my father said to me one night, when we were sitting by the\r\nfire together, and no one else was in the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom hesitated a little, and then went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said something to me about Maggie, and then he said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nbeen good to my sister, though she married against my will, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlent Moss money; but I shall never think of distressing him to pay it;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather lose it. My children must not mind being the poorer for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99 And now my father\xe2\x80\x99s ill, and not able to speak for himself, I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like anything to be done contrary to what he said to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but then, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Glegg, whose good feeling led him\r\nto enter into Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wish, but who could not at once shake off his\r\nhabitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities, or\r\nalienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference\r\nin a man\xe2\x80\x99s property, \xe2\x80\x9cwe should have to make away wi\xe2\x80\x99 the note, you\r\nknow, if we\xe2\x80\x99re to guard against what may happen, supposing your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s made bankrupt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted his wife, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cmind what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re putting yourself very forrard in other folks\xe2\x80\x99s business. If you\r\nspeak rash, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it was my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as I never heared of before,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet,\r\nwho had been making haste with his lozenge in order to express his\r\namazement,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmaking away with a note! I should think anybody could set\r\nthe constable on you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cif the note\xe2\x80\x99s worth all that money,\r\nwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we pay it away, and save my things from going away? We\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\ncall to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss, Tom, if you think your\r\nfather \xe2\x80\x99ud be angry when he gets well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange, and was\r\nstraining her mind after original ideas on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh, pooh! you women don\xe2\x80\x99t understand these things,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle\r\nGlegg. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way o\xe2\x80\x99 making it safe for Mr and Mrs Moss but\r\ndestroying the note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me do it, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my\r\nfather shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get well, I should be very unhappy to think anything\r\nhad been done against his will that I could hinder. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\r\nmeant me to remember what he said that evening. I ought to obey my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wish about his property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mrs Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom\xe2\x80\x99s words; she\r\nfelt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him, though, if\r\nhis father had been a Dodson, there would never have been this wicked\r\nalienation of money. Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from\r\nleaping on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s neck, if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by\r\nherself rising and taking Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hand, while she said, with rather a\r\nchoked voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a God\r\nabove; and if the money\xe2\x80\x99s wanted for your father, Moss and me \xe2\x80\x99ull pay\r\nit, the same as if there was ever such security. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do as we\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\ndone by; for if my children have got no other luck, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\r\nhonest father and mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing your father\r\n_was_ bankrupt. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 that, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a creditor\r\nmyself, and seen no end o\xe2\x80\x99 cheating. If he meant to give your aunt the\r\nmoney before ever he got into this sad work o\xe2\x80\x99 lawing, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d made away with the note himself; for he\xe2\x80\x99d made up his mind to\r\nbe that much poorer. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 things to be considered,\r\nyoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\r\ncome to money business, and you may be taking one man\xe2\x80\x99s dinner away to\r\nmake another man\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast. You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that, I doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know if I owe money to one man,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to give it to another. But if my father had made up his\r\nmind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt, he had a right to\r\ndo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, young man! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d been so sharp,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle\r\nGlegg, with much candor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps your father _did_ make away with\r\nthe note. Let us go and see if we can find it in the chest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in my father\xe2\x80\x99s room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nMaggie.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nA Vanishing Gleam\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver, even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had\r\nrecurred at intervals ever since he had been found fallen from his\r\nhorse, was usually in so apathetic a condition that the exits and\r\nentrances into his room were not felt to be of great importance. He had\r\nlain so still, with his eyes closed, all this morning, that Maggie told\r\nher aunt Moss she must not expect her father to take any notice of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey entered very quietly, and Mrs Moss took her seat near the head of\r\nthe bed, while Maggie sat in her old place on the bed, and put her hand\r\non her father\xe2\x80\x99s without causing any change in his face.\r\n\r\nMr Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy\r\nselecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had\r\nbrought from his father\xe2\x80\x99s bureau. They succeeded in opening the\r\nchest,\xe2\x80\x94which stood opposite the foot of Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s bed,\xe2\x80\x94and propping\r\nthe lid with the iron holder, without much noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a tin box,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mr Glegg; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d most like put a small\r\nthing like a note in there. Lift it out, Tom; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll just lift up\r\nthese deeds,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re the deeds o\xe2\x80\x99 the house and mill, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsee what there is under \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Glegg had lifted out the parchments, and had fortunately drawn back\r\na little, when the iron holder gave way, and the heavy lid fell with a\r\nloud bang that resounded over the house.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of\r\nthe strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the\r\nframe of the prostrate man, and for the time completely shook off the\r\nobstruction of paralysis. The chest had belonged to his father and his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s father, and it had always been rather a solemn business to\r\nvisit it. All long-known objects, even a mere window fastening or a\r\nparticular door-latch, have sounds which are a sort of recognised voice\r\nto us,\xe2\x80\x94a voice that will thrill and awaken, when it has been used to\r\ntouch deep-lying fibres. In the same moment, when all the eyes in the\r\nroom were turned upon him, he started up and looked at the chest, the\r\nparchments in Mr Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and Tom holding the tin box, with a\r\nglance of perfect consciousness and recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do with those deeds?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his ordinary\r\ntone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Tom.\r\nWhat do you do, going to my chest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom obeyed, with some trembling; it was the first time his father had\r\nrecognised him. But instead of saying anything more to him, his father\r\ncontinued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr Glegg\r\nand the deeds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s been happening, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you meddling\r\nwith my deeds for? Is Wakem laying hold of everything? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntell me what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he added impatiently, as Mr Glegg\r\nadvanced to the foot of the bed before speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, friend Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, in a soothing tone. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting hold of anything as yet. We only came to look and see what was\r\nin the chest. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been ill, you know, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to look after\r\nthings a bit. But let\xe2\x80\x99s hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be well enough to attend to\r\neverything yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver looked around him meditatively, at Tom, at Mr Glegg, and at\r\nMaggie; then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by his\r\nside at the head of the bed he turned sharply round and saw his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Gritty!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which he\r\nhad been wont to speak to her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you\xe2\x80\x99re there, are you? How could\r\nyou manage to leave the children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, brother!\xe2\x80\x9d said good Mrs Moss, too impulsive to be prudent, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthankful I\xe2\x80\x99m come now to see you yourself again; I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nknow us any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! have I had a stroke?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, anxiously, looking at Mr\r\nGlegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fall from your horse\xe2\x80\x94shook you a bit,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nGlegg. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get over it, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver fixed his eyes on the bed-clothes, and remained silent for\r\ntwo or three minutes. A new shadow came over his face. He looked up at\r\nMaggie first, and said in a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou got the letter, then, my\r\nwench?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, kissing him with a full heart. She felt as if\r\nher father were come back to her from the dead, and her yearning to\r\nshow him how she had always loved him could be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, so preoccupied that he received the\r\nkiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s downstairs with my aunts, father. Shall I fetch her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay; poor Bessy!\xe2\x80\x9d and his eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take care of \xe2\x80\x99em both if I die, you know, Tom. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe badly off, I doubt. But you must see and pay everybody. And\r\nmind,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s fifty pound o\xe2\x80\x99 Luke\xe2\x80\x99s as I put into the business,\xe2\x80\x94he gave\r\nme a bit at a time, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing to show for it. You must pay\r\nhim first thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head, and looked more concerned\r\nthan ever, but Tom said firmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father. And haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a note from my uncle Moss for three\r\nhundred pounds? We came to look for that. What do you wish to be done\r\nabout it, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you thought o\xe2\x80\x99 that, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI allays\r\nmeant to be easy about that money, because o\xe2\x80\x99 your aunt. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind losing the money, if they can\xe2\x80\x99t pay it,\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s like enough they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. The note\xe2\x80\x99s in that box, mind! I allays meant to be good to you,\r\nGritty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, turning to his sister; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know you\r\naggravated me when you would have Moss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maggie re-entered with her mother, who came in much\r\nagitated by the news that her husband was quite himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as she kissed him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must forgive me if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re worse off than you ever expected to be.\r\n\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s the fault o\xe2\x80\x99 the law,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s none o\xe2\x80\x99 mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he added angrily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the fault o\xe2\x80\x99 raskills. Tom, you mind this: if ever you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the\r\nchance, you make Wakem smart. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good-for-nothing\r\nson. You might horse-whip him, but he\xe2\x80\x99d set the law on you,\xe2\x80\x94the law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmade to take care o\xe2\x80\x99 raskills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver was getting excited, and an alarming flush was on his face.\r\nMr Glegg wanted to say something soothing, but he was prevented by Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s speaking again to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll make a shift to pay\r\neverything, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet leave you your furniture; and\r\nyour sisters\xe2\x80\x99ll do something for you\xe2\x80\x94and Tom\xe2\x80\x99ll grow up\xe2\x80\x94though what\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s to be I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I could\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve given him a\r\neddication\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s the little wench, she\xe2\x80\x99ll get married\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npoor tale\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with the\r\nlast words the poor man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though this\r\nwas only a recurrence of what had happened before, it struck all\r\npresent as if it had been death, not only from its contrast with the\r\ncompleteness of the revival, but because his words had all had\r\nreference to the possibility that his death was near. But with poor\r\nTulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a long descent under\r\nthickening shadows.\r\n\r\nMr Turnbull was sent for; but when he heard what had passed, he said\r\nthis complete restoration, though only temporary, was a hopeful sign,\r\nproving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nAmong the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up,\r\nhe had omitted the bill of sale; the flash of memory had only lit up\r\nprominent ideas, and he sank into forgetfulness again with half his\r\nhumiliation unlearned.\r\n\r\nBut Tom was clear upon two points,\xe2\x80\x94that his uncle Moss\xe2\x80\x99s note must be\r\ndestroyed; and that Luke\xe2\x80\x99s money must be paid, if in no other way, out\r\nof his own and Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s money now in the savings bank. There were\r\nsubjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the\r\nniceties of classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nTom Applies His Knife to the Oyster\r\n\r\nThe next day, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Tom was on his way to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, to see\r\nhis uncle Deane, who was to come home last night, his aunt had said;\r\nand Tom had made up his mind that his uncle Deane was the right person\r\nto ask for advice about getting some employment. He was in a great way\r\nof business; he had not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg; and he had\r\nrisen in the world on a scale of advancement which accorded with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark, chill, misty morning, likely to end in rain,\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthose mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes. And\r\nTom was very unhappy; he felt the humiliation as well as the\r\nprospective hardships of his lot with all the keenness of a proud\r\nnature; and with all his resolute dutifulness toward his father there\r\nmingled an irrepressible indignation against him which gave misfortune\r\nthe less endurable aspect of a wrong. Since these were the consequences\r\nof going to law, his father was really blamable, as his aunts and\r\nuncles had always said he was; and it was a significant indication of\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s character, that though he thought his aunts ought to do something\r\nmore for his mother, he felt nothing like Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s violent resentment\r\nagainst them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity. There were\r\nno impulses in Tom that led him to expect what did not present itself\r\nto him as a right to be demanded. Why should people give away their\r\nmoney plentifully to those who had not taken care of their own money?\r\nTom saw some justice in severity; and all the more, because he had\r\nconfidence in himself that he should never deserve that just severity.\r\nIt was very hard upon him that he should be put at this disadvantage in\r\nlife by his father\xe2\x80\x99s want of prudence; but he was not going to complain\r\nand to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy\r\nfor him. He would ask no one to help him, more than to give him work\r\nand pay him for it. Poor Tom was not without his hopes to take refuge\r\nin under the chill damp imprisonment of the December fog, which seemed\r\nonly like a part of his home troubles. At sixteen, the mind that has\r\nthe strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and\r\nself-flattery; and Tom, in sketching his future, had no other guide in\r\narranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave\r\nself-reliance. Both Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, he knew, had been very poor\r\nonce; he did not want to save money slowly and retire on a moderate\r\nfortune like his uncle Glegg, but he would be like his uncle Deane\xe2\x80\x94get\r\na situation in some great house of business and rise fast. He had\r\nscarcely seen anything of his uncle Deane for the last three years\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntwo families had been getting wider apart; but for this very reason Tom\r\nwas the more hopeful about applying to him. His uncle Glegg, he felt\r\nsure, would never encourage any spirited project, but he had a vague\r\nimposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane\xe2\x80\x99s command. He had\r\nheard his father say, long ago, how Deane had made himself so valuable\r\nto Guest & Co. that they were glad enough to offer him a share in the\r\nbusiness; that was what Tom resolved _he_ would do. It was intolerable\r\nto think of being poor and looked down upon all one\xe2\x80\x99s life. He would\r\nprovide for his mother and sister, and make every one say that he was a\r\nman of high character. He leaped over the years in this way, and, in\r\nthe haste of strong purpose and strong desire, did not see how they\r\nwould be made up of slow days, hours, and minutes.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was\r\nentering St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, he was thinking that he would buy his father\xe2\x80\x99s mill\r\nand land again when he was rich enough, and improve the house and live\r\nthere; he should prefer it to any smarter, newer place, and he could\r\nkeep as many horses and dogs as he liked.\r\n\r\nWalking along the street with a firm, rapid step, at this point in his\r\nreverie he was startled by some one who had crossed without his notice,\r\nand who said to him in a rough, familiar voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Master Tom, how\xe2\x80\x99s your father this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d It was a publican of\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s customers.\r\n\r\nTom disliked being spoken to just then; but he said civilly, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstill very ill, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a sore chance for you, young man, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nlawsuit turning out against him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the publican, with a confused,\r\nbeery idea of being good-natured.\r\n\r\nTom reddened and passed on; he would have felt it like the handling of\r\na bruise, even if there had been the most polite and delicate reference\r\nto his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the publican to a grocer standing on the\r\nadjacent door-step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the grocer, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I knew his features. He takes after\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s family; she was a Dodson. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine, straight youth;\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s he been brought up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! to turn up his nose at his father\xe2\x80\x99s customers, and be a fine\r\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x94not much else, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of\r\nthe present, made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices\r\nof Guest & Co., where he expected to find his uncle Deane. But this was\r\nMr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s morning at the bank, a clerk told him, and with some\r\ncontempt for his ignorance; Mr Deane was not to be found in River\r\nStreet on a Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nAt the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was,\r\nimmediately after sending in his name. Mr Deane was auditing accounts;\r\nbut he looked up as Tom entered, and putting out his hand, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nTom, nothing fresh the matter at home, I hope? How\xe2\x80\x99s your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch the same, thank you, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, feeling nervous. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nwant to speak to you, please, when you\xe2\x80\x99re at liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, relapsing into his accounts, in\r\nwhich he and the managing-clerk remained so absorbed for the next\r\nhalf-hour that Tom began to wonder whether he should have to sit in\r\nthis way till the bank closed,\xe2\x80\x94there seemed so little tendency toward a\r\nconclusion in the quiet, monotonous procedure of these sleek,\r\nprosperous men of business. Would his uncle give him a place in the\r\nbank? It would be very dull, prosy work, he thought, writing there\r\nforever to the loud ticking of a timepiece. He preferred some other way\r\nof getting rich. But at last there was a change; his uncle took a pen\r\nand wrote something with a flourish at the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll just step up to Torry\xe2\x80\x99s now, Mr Spence, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDeane, and the clock suddenly became less loud and deliberate in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, when they were alone, turning his\r\nsubstantial person a little in his chair, and taking out his snuff-box;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the business, my boy; what\xe2\x80\x99s the business?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Deane, who had\r\nheard from his wife what had passed the day before, thought Tom was\r\ncome to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me for troubling you, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\r\ncolouring, but speaking in a tone which, though, tremulous, had a\r\ncertain proud independence in it; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought you were the best\r\nperson to advise me what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, reserving his pinch of snuff, and looking at Tom\r\nwith new attention, \xe2\x80\x9clet us hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to get a situation, uncle, so that I may earn some money,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom, who never fell into circumlocution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA situation?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, and then took his pinch of snuff with\r\nelaborate justice to each nostril. Tom thought snuff-taking a most\r\nprovoking habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, let me see, how old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, as he threw himself\r\nbackward again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen; I mean, I am going in seventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, hoping his uncle\r\nnoticed how much beard he had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see; your father had some notion of making you an engineer, I\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could get any money at that for a long while,\r\ncould I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true; but people don\xe2\x80\x99t get much money at anything, my boy, when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re only sixteen. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good deal of schooling, however; I\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well up in accounts, eh? You understand book\r\nkeeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, rather falteringly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in Practice. But Mr Stelling\r\nsays I write a good hand, uncle. That\xe2\x80\x99s my writing,\xe2\x80\x9d added Tom, laying\r\non the table a copy of the list he had made yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s good, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. But, you see, the best hand in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99ll not get you a better place than a copying-clerk\xe2\x80\x99s, if you know\r\nnothing of book-keeping,\xe2\x80\x94nothing of accounts. And a copying-clerk\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncheap article. But what have you been learning at school, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education, and had no\r\nprecise conception of what went forward in expensive schools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe learned Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, pausing a little between each item, as if\r\nhe were turning over the books in his school-desk to assist his\r\nmemory,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca good deal of Latin; and the last year I did Themes, one week\r\nin Latin and one in English; and Greek and Roman history; and Euclid;\r\nand I began Algebra, but I left it off again; and we had one day every\r\nweek for Arithmetic. Then I used to have drawing-lessons; and there\r\nwere several other books we either read or learned out of,\xe2\x80\x94English\r\nPoetry, and Hor\xc3\xa6 Paulin\xc3\xa6 and Blair\xe2\x80\x99s Rhetoric, the last half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane tapped his snuff-box again and screwed up his mouth; he felt\r\nin the position of many estimable persons when they had read the New\r\nTariff, and found how many commodities were imported of which they knew\r\nnothing; like a cautious man of business, he was not going to speak\r\nrashly of a raw material in which he had had no experience. But the\r\npresumption was, that if it had been good for anything, so successful a\r\nman as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nAbout Latin he had an opinion, and thought that in case of another war,\r\nsince people would no longer wear hair-powder, it would be well to put\r\na tax upon Latin, as a luxury much run upon by the higher classes, and\r\nnot telling at all on the ship-owning department. But, for what he\r\nknew, the Hor\xc3\xa6 Paulin\xc3\xa6 might be something less neutral. On the whole,\r\nthis list of acquirements gave him a sort of repulsion toward poor Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, in rather a cold, sardonic tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nthree years at these things,\xe2\x80\x94you must be pretty strong in \xe2\x80\x99em. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou better take up some line where they\xe2\x80\x99ll come in handy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom coloured, and burst out, with new energy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not have any employment of that sort, uncle. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nLatin and those things. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I could do with them unless I\r\nwent as usher in a school; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them well enough for that!\r\nbesides, I would as soon carry a pair of panniers. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be\r\nthat sort of person. I should like to enter into some business where I\r\ncan get on,\xe2\x80\x94a manly business, where I should have to look after things,\r\nand get credit for what I did. And I shall want to keep my mother and\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, with that tendency to repress\r\nyouthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of\r\ntheir easiest duties, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s sooner said than done,\xe2\x80\x94sooner said than\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ get on in that way, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, a little\r\nirritated that Mr Deane did not enter more rapidly into his views. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmean, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you rise from one place to another through your abilities\r\nand good conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, spreading himself in his chair a little,\r\nand entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his own career.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how I got on. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t by getting astride a stick\r\nand thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long enough. I\r\nkept my eyes and ears open, sir, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too fond of my own back,\r\nand I made my master\xe2\x80\x99s interest my own. Why, with only looking into\r\nwhat went on in the mill, I found out how there was a waste of five\r\nhundred a-year that might be hindered. Why, sir, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t more\r\nschooling to begin with than a charity boy; but I saw pretty soon that\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on far enough without mastering accounts, and I learned\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em between working hours, after I\xe2\x80\x99d been unlading. Look here.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nDeane opened a book and pointed to the page. \xe2\x80\x9cI write a good hand\r\nenough, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head;\r\nand I got it all by hard work, and paid for it out of my own\r\nearnings,\xe2\x80\x94often out of my own dinner and supper. And I looked into the\r\nnature of all the things we had to do in the business, and picked up\r\nknowledge as I went about my work, and turned it over in my head. Why,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m no mechanic,\xe2\x80\x94I never pretended to be\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of a thing or\r\ntwo that the mechanics never thought of, and it\xe2\x80\x99s made a fine\r\ndifference in our returns. And there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an article shipped or\r\nunshipped at our wharf but I know the quality of it. If I got places,\r\nsir, it was because I made myself fit for \xe2\x80\x99em. If you want to slip into\r\na round hole, you must make a ball of yourself; that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane tapped his box again. He had been led on by pure enthusiasm in\r\nhis subject, and had really forgotten what bearing this retrospective\r\nsurvey had on his listener. He had found occasion for saying the same\r\nthing more than once before, and was not distinctly aware that he had\r\nnot his port-wine before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a slight complaint in his tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I should like to do. Can\xe2\x80\x99t _I_ get on in the same way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the same way?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, eyeing Tom with quiet deliberation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere go two or three questions to that, Master Tom. That depends on\r\nwhat sort of material you are, to begin with, and whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nput into the right mill. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is. Your poor father\r\nwent the wrong way to work in giving you an education. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nbusiness, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere; but it is as I thought it would be.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a sort of learning that\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for a young fellow\r\nlike our Mr Stephen Guest, who\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing to do but sign checks\r\nall his life, and may as well have Latin inside his head as any other\r\nsort of stuffing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why the Latin need\r\nhinder me from getting on in business. I shall soon forget it all; it\r\nmakes no difference to me. I had to do my lessons at school, but I\r\nalways thought they\xe2\x80\x99d never be of any use to me afterward; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, that\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter\r\nwhat I was going to say. Your Latin and rigmarole may soon dry off you,\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99ll be but a bare stick after that. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s whitened your\r\nhands and taken the rough work out of you. And what do you know? Why,\r\nyou know nothing about book-keeping, to begin with, and not so much of\r\nreckoning as a common shopman. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to begin at a low round of\r\nthe ladder, let me tell you, if you mean to get on in life. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nforgetting the education your father\xe2\x80\x99s been paying for, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive yourself a new un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom bit his lips hard; he felt as if the tears were rising, and he\r\nwould rather die than let them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to help you to a situation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Deane went on; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno fault to find with that. I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to do something for you. But\r\nyou youngsters nowadays think you\xe2\x80\x99re to begin with living well and\r\nworking easy; you\xe2\x80\x99ve no notion of running afoot before you get\r\nhorseback. Now, you must remember what you are,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re a lad of\r\nsixteen, trained to nothing particular. There\xe2\x80\x99s heaps of your sort,\r\nlike so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere. Well, you might be\r\napprenticed to some business,\xe2\x80\x94a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s and druggist\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps; your\r\nLatin might come in a bit there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was going to speak, but Mr Deane put up his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! hear what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a \xe2\x80\x99prentice,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow, I know,\xe2\x80\x94you want to make more haste, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stand\r\nbehind a counter. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re a copying-clerk, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stand\r\nbehind a desk, and stare at your ink and paper all day; there isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch out-look there, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t be much wiser at the end of the year\r\nthan at the beginning. The world isn\xe2\x80\x99t made of pen, ink, and paper, and\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re to get on in the world, young man, you must know what the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s made of. Now the best chance for you \xe2\x80\x99ud be to have a place on\r\na wharf, or in a warehouse, where you\xe2\x80\x99d learn the smell of things, but\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound; you\xe2\x80\x99d have to stand cold and\r\nwet, and be shouldered about by rough fellows. You\xe2\x80\x99re too fine a\r\ngentleman for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane paused and looked hard at Tom, who certainly felt some inward\r\nstruggle before he could reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather do what will be best for me in the end, sir; I would\r\nput up with what was disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well, if you can carry it out. But you must remember it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nonly laying hold of a rope, you must go on pulling. It\xe2\x80\x99s the mistake\r\nyou lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your\r\npocket, to think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better start in the world if you stick\r\nyourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean, and have the\r\nshopwenches take you for fine gentlemen. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way _I_\r\nstarted, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of handling cheeses. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason I can wear good\r\nbroadcloth now, and have my legs under the same table with the heads of\r\nthe best firms in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Deane tapped his box, and seemed to expand a little under his\r\nwaistcoat and gold chain, as he squared his shoulders in the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I\r\nshould do for? I should like to set to work at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a\r\nslight tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, stop a bit; we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be in too great a hurry. You must\r\nbear in mind, if I put you in a place you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit young for, because\r\nyou happen to be my nephew, I shall be responsible for you. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because it\r\nremains to be seen whether you\xe2\x80\x99re good for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, hurt, as\r\nall boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel\r\nno ground for trusting them. \xe2\x80\x9cI care about my own credit too much for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Tom, well done! That\xe2\x80\x99s the right spirit, and I never refuse\r\nto help anybody if they\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to do themselves justice. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nyoung man of two-and-twenty I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my eye on now. I shall do what I\r\ncan for that young man; he\xe2\x80\x99s got some pith in him. But then, you see,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s made good use of his time,\xe2\x80\x94a first-rate calculator,\xe2\x80\x94can tell you\r\nthe cubic contents of anything in no time, and put me up the other day\r\nto a new market for Swedish bark; he\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly knowing in\r\nmanufactures, that young fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better set about learning book-keeping, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom, anxious to prove his readiness to exert himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do amiss there. But\xe2\x80\x94Ah, Spence, you\xe2\x80\x99re back again.\r\nWell Tom, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to be said just now, I think, and I must\r\ngo to business again. Good-by. Remember me to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane put out his hand, with an air of friendly dismissal, and Tom\r\nhad not courage to ask another question, especially in the presence of\r\nMr Spence. So he went out again into the cold damp air. He had to call\r\nat his uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s about the money in the Savings Bank, and by the\r\ntime he set out again the mist had thickened, and he could not see very\r\nfar before him; but going along River Street again, he was startled,\r\nwhen he was within two yards of the projecting side of a shop-window,\r\nby the words \xe2\x80\x9cDorlcote Mill\xe2\x80\x9d in large letters on a hand-bill, placed as\r\nif on purpose to stare at him. It was the catalogue of the sale to take\r\nplace the next week; it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nPoor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way\r\nhomeward; he only felt that the present was very hard. It seemed a\r\nwrong toward him that his uncle Deane had no confidence in him,\xe2\x80\x94did not\r\nsee at once that he should acquit himself well, which Tom himself was\r\nas certain of as of the daylight. Apparently he, Tom Tulliver, was\r\nlikely to be held of small account in the world; and for the first time\r\nhe felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he really was very\r\nignorant, and could do very little. Who was that enviable young man\r\nthat could tell the cubic contents of things in no time, and make\r\nsuggestions about Swedish bark! Tom had been used to be so entirely\r\nsatisfied with himself, in spite of his breaking down in a\r\ndemonstration, and construing _nunc illas promite vires_ as \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\npromise those men\xe2\x80\x9d; but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage, because\r\nhe knew less than some one else knew. There must be a world of things\r\nconnected with that Swedish bark, which, if he only knew them, might\r\nhave helped him to get on. It would have been much easier to make a\r\nfigure with a spirited horse and a new saddle.\r\n\r\nTwo hours ago, as Tom was walking to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, he saw the distant\r\nfuture before him as he might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth\r\nsandy beach beyond a belt of flinty shingles; he was on the grassy bank\r\nthen, and thought the shingles might soon be passed. But now his feet\r\nwere on the sharp stones; the belt of shingles had widened, and the\r\nstretch of sand had dwindled into narrowness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did my Uncle Deane say, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, putting her arm\r\nthrough Tom\xe2\x80\x99s as he was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he say he would give you a situation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite promise me anything; he seemed\r\nto think I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a very good situation. I\xe2\x80\x99m too young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t he speak kindly, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly? Pooh! what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking about that? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nabout his speaking kindly, if I could get a situation. But it\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\nnuisance and bother; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at school all this while learning Latin\r\nand things,\xe2\x80\x94not a bit of good to me,\xe2\x80\x94and now my uncle says I must set\r\nabout learning book-keeping and calculation, and those things. He seems\r\nto make out I\xe2\x80\x99m good for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he looked at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a pity we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got Dominie Sampson!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, who\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help mingling some gayety with their sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he had\r\ntaught me book-keeping by double entry and after the Italian method, as\r\nhe did Lucy Bertram, I could teach you, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ teach! Yes, I dare say. That\xe2\x80\x99s always the tone you take,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Tom, I was only joking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, putting her cheek against\r\nhis coat-sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s always the same, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with the little frown he\r\nput on when he was about to be justifiably severe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\nsetting yourself up above me and every one else, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to\r\ntell you about it several times. You ought not to have spoken as you\r\ndid to my uncles and aunts; you should leave it to me to take care of\r\nmy mother and you, and not put yourself forward. You think you know\r\nbetter than any one, but you\xe2\x80\x99re almost always wrong. I can judge much\r\nbetter than you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Tom! he had just come from being lectured and made to feel his\r\ninferiority; the reaction of his strong, self-asserting nature must\r\ntake place somehow; and here was a case in which he could justly show\r\nhimself dominant. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s cheek flushed and her lip quivered with\r\nconflicting resentment and affection, and a certain awe as well as\r\nadmiration of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s firmer and more effective character. She did not\r\nanswer immediately; very angry words rose to her lips, but they were\r\ndriven back again, and she said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou often think I\xe2\x80\x99m conceited, Tom, when I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean what I say at\r\nall in that way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to put myself above you; I know you\r\nbehaved better than I did yesterday. But you are always so harsh to me,\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the last words the resentment was rising again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not harsh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with severe decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always kind\r\nto you, and so I shall be; I shall always take care of you. But you\r\nmust mind what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir mother came in now, and Maggie rushed away, that her burst of\r\ntears, which she felt must come, might not happen till she was safe\r\nupstairs. They were very bitter tears; everybody in the world seemed so\r\nhard and unkind to Maggie; there was no indulgence, no fondness, such\r\nas she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own\r\nthoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or\r\ntender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not\r\nshow their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was\r\nnot a happy one, Maggie felt; it seemed to be a world where people\r\nbehaved the best to those they did not pretend to love, and that did\r\nnot belong to them. And if life had no love in it, what else was there\r\nfor Maggie? Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnarrow griefs, perhaps of her father\xe2\x80\x99s heart-cutting childish\r\ndependence. There is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth,\r\nwhen the soul is made up of wants, and has no long memories, no\r\nsuperadded life in the life of others; though we who looked on think\r\nlightly of such premature despair, as if our vision of the future\r\nlightened the blind sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s present.\r\n\r\nMaggie, in her brown frock, with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair\r\npushed back, looking from the bed where her father lay to the dull\r\nwalls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her world, was a\r\ncreature full of eager, passionate longings for all that was beautiful\r\nand glad; thirsty for all knowledge; with an ear straining after dreamy\r\nmusic that died away and would not come near to her; with a blind,\r\nunconscious yearning for something that would link together the\r\nwonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give her soul a\r\nsense of home in it.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, when there is this contrast between the outward and the\r\ninward, that painful collisions come of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nTending to Refute the Popular Prejudice against the Present of a\r\nPocket-Knife\r\n\r\nIn that dark time of December, the sale of the household furniture\r\nlasted beyond the middle of the second day. Mr Tulliver, who had begun,\r\nin his intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability which\r\noften appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic\r\nrigidity and insensibility, had lain in this living death throughout\r\nthe critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his\r\nchamber. Mr Turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk to let\r\nhim remain where he was than to remove him to Luke\xe2\x80\x99s cottage,\xe2\x80\x94a plan\r\nwhich the good Luke had proposed to Mrs Tulliver, thinking it would be\r\nvery bad if the master were \xe2\x80\x9cto waken up\xe2\x80\x9d at the noise of the sale; and\r\nthe wife and children had sat imprisoned in the silent chamber,\r\nwatching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and trembling lest the\r\nblank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell\r\non their own ears with such obstinate, painful repetition.\r\n\r\nBut it was over at last, that time of importunate certainty and\r\neye-straining suspense. The sharp sound of a voice, almost as metallic\r\nas the rap that followed it, had ceased; the tramping of footsteps on\r\nthe gravel had died out. Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s blond face seemed aged ten\r\nyears by the last thirty hours; the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind had been busy\r\ndivining when her favourite things were being knocked down by the\r\nterrible hammer; her heart had been fluttering at the thought that\r\nfirst one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in\r\nthe hateful publicity of the Golden Lion; and all the while she had to\r\nsit and make no sign of this inward agitation. Such things bring lines\r\nin well-rounded faces, and broaden the streaks of white among the hairs\r\nthat once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine. Already,\r\nat three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Kezia, the good-hearted, bad-tempered housemaid, who\r\nregarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies, the\r\ndirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality, had begun to scrub\r\nand swill with an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering\r\nagainst \xe2\x80\x9cfolks as came to buy up other folk\xe2\x80\x99s things,\xe2\x80\x9d and made light\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cscrazing\xe2\x80\x9d the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than\r\nthemselves had had to\xe2\x80\x94suffer a waste of tissue through evaporation. She\r\nwas not scrubbing indiscriminately, for there would be further dirt of\r\nthe same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away\r\ntheir purchases; but she was bent on bringing the parlour, where that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpipe-smoking pig,\xe2\x80\x9d the bailiff, had sat, to such an appearance of\r\nscant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few\r\narticles of furniture bought in for the family. Her mistress and the\r\nyoung folks should have their tea in it that night, Kezia was\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIt was between five and six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, near the usual teatime, when she\r\ncame upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted. The person who\r\nwanted him was in the kitchen, and in the first moments, by the\r\nimperfect fire and candle light, Tom had not even an indefinite sense\r\nof any acquaintance with the rather broad-set but active figure,\r\nperhaps two years older than himself, that looked at him with a pair of\r\nblue eyes set in a disc of freckles, and pulled some curly red locks\r\nwith a strong intention of respect. A low-crowned oilskin-covered hat,\r\nand a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the costume, as of\r\ntablets prepared for writing upon, suggested a calling that had to do\r\nwith boats; but this did not help Tom\xe2\x80\x99s memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarvant, Master Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said he of the red locks, with a smile which\r\nseemed to break through a self-imposed air of melancholy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow me again, I doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, as Tom continued to look at him\r\ninquiringly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk to you by yourself a bit, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a fire i\xe2\x80\x99 the parlour, Master Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kezia, who objected\r\nto leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, wondering if this young fellow\r\nbelonged to Guest & Co.\xe2\x80\x99s Wharf, for his imagination ran continually\r\ntoward that particular spot; and uncle Deane might any time be sending\r\nfor him to say that there was a situation at liberty.\r\n\r\nThe bright fire in the parlour was the only light that showed the few\r\nchairs, the bureau, the carpetless floor, and the one table\xe2\x80\x94no, not the\r\n_one_ table; there was a second table, in a corner, with a large Bible\r\nand a few other books upon it. It was this new strange bareness that\r\nTom felt first, before he thought of looking again at the face which\r\nwas also lit up by the fire, and which stole a half-shy, questioning\r\nglance at him as the entirely strange voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember Bob, then, as you gen the pocket-knife to, Mr\r\nTom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rough-handled pocket-knife was taken out in the same moment, and\r\nthe largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Bob Jakin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, not with any cordial delight, for he felt\r\na little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolised by the pocket-knife,\r\nand was not at all sure that Bob\xe2\x80\x99s motives for recalling it were\r\nentirely admirable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Bob Jakin, if Jakin it must be, \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s so many Bobs as\r\nyou went arter the squerrils with, that day as I plumped right down\r\nfrom the bough, and bruised my shins a good un\xe2\x80\x94but I got the squerril\r\ntight for all that, an\xe2\x80\x99 a scratter it was. An\xe2\x80\x99 this littlish blade\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbroke, you see, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hev a new un put in, \xe2\x80\x99cause they might\r\nbe cheatin\xe2\x80\x99 me an\xe2\x80\x99 givin\xe2\x80\x99 me another knife instid, for there isn\xe2\x80\x99t such\r\na blade i\xe2\x80\x99 the country,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s got used to my hand, like. An\xe2\x80\x99 there was\r\nniver nobody else gen me nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but what I got by my own sharpness,\r\nonly you, Mr Tom; if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Bill Fawks as gen me the terrier pup\r\nistid o\xe2\x80\x99 drowndin\xe2\x80\x99t it, an\xe2\x80\x99 I had to jaw him a good un afore he\xe2\x80\x99d give\r\nit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility, and got through\r\nhis long speech with surprising despatch, giving the blade of his knife\r\nan affectionate rub on his sleeve when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a slight air of patronage, the foregoing\r\nreminscences having disposed him to be as friendly as was becoming,\r\nthough there was no part of his acquaintance with Bob that he\r\nremembered better than the cause of their parting quarrel; \xe2\x80\x9cis there\r\nanything I can do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no, Mr Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bob, shutting up his knife with a click and\r\nreturning it to his pocket, where he seemed to be feeling for something\r\nelse. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 come back upon you now ye\xe2\x80\x99re i\xe2\x80\x99 trouble, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfolks say as the master, as I used to frighten the birds for, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nflogged me a bit for fun when he catched me eatin\xe2\x80\x99 the turnip, as they\r\nsay he\xe2\x80\x99ll niver lift up his head no more,\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 come now to\r\nax you to gi\xe2\x80\x99 me another knife \xe2\x80\x99cause you gen me one afore. If a chap\r\ngives me one black eye, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me; I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ax him for\r\nanother afore I sarve him out; an\xe2\x80\x99 a good turn\xe2\x80\x99s worth as much as a bad\r\nun, anyhow. I shall niver grow down\xe2\x80\x99ards again, Mr Tom, an\xe2\x80\x99 you war the\r\nlittle chap as I liked the best when _I_ war a little chap, for all you\r\nleathered me, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me again. There\xe2\x80\x99s Dick Brumby,\r\nthere, I could leather him as much as I\xe2\x80\x99d a mind; but lors! you get\r\ntired o\xe2\x80\x99 leatherin\xe2\x80\x99 a chap when you can niver make him see what you\r\nwant him to shy at. I\xe2\x80\x99n seen chaps as \xe2\x80\x99ud stand starin\xe2\x80\x99 at a bough till\r\ntheir eyes shot out, afore they\xe2\x80\x99d see as a bird\xe2\x80\x99s tail warn\xe2\x80\x99t a leaf.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s poor work goin\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 such raff. But you war allays a rare un at\r\nshying, Mr Tom, an\xe2\x80\x99 I could trusten to you for droppin\xe2\x80\x99 down wi\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nstick in the nick o\xe2\x80\x99 time at a runnin\xe2\x80\x99 rat, or a stoat, or that, when I\r\nwar a-beatin\xe2\x80\x99 the bushes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag, and would perhaps not have paused\r\njust then if Maggie had not entered the room and darted a look of\r\nsurprise and curiosity at him, whereupon he pulled his red locks again\r\nwith due respect. But the next moment the sense of the altered room\r\ncame upon Maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence. Her eyes had immediately glanced from him to the place where\r\nthe bookcase had hung; there was nothing now but the oblong unfaded\r\nspace on the wall, and below it the small table with the Bible and the\r\nfew other books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are the books? I\r\nthought my uncle Glegg said he would buy them. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Are those all\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve left us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with a sort of desperate indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nshould they buy many books when they bought so little furniture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, her eyes filling with tears, as she rushed\r\nup to the table to see what books had been rescued. \xe2\x80\x9cOur dear old\r\nPilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress that you coloured with your little paints; and that\r\npicture of Pilgrim with a mantle on, looking just like a turtle\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie went on, half sobbing as she turned over the few books,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should never part with that while we lived; everything is\r\ngoing away from us; the end of our lives will have nothing in it like\r\nthe beginning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair, with\r\nthe big tears ready to roll down her cheeks, quite blinded to the\r\npresence of Bob, who was looking at her with the pursuant gaze of an\r\nintelligent dumb animal, with perceptions more perfect than his\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, feeling that the subject of the books was\r\nunseasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you just came to see me because we\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\ntrouble? That was very good-natured of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it is, Master Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, beginning to untwist\r\nhis canvas bag. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99n been with a barge this two \xe2\x80\x99ear; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow I\xe2\x80\x99n been gettin\xe2\x80\x99 my livin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t when I was tentin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfurnace, between whiles, at Torry\xe2\x80\x99s mill. But a fortni\xe2\x80\x99t ago I\xe2\x80\x99d a rare\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 luck,\xe2\x80\x94I allays thought I was a lucky chap, for I niver set a\r\ntrap but what I catched something; but this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trap, it was a fire\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 Torry\xe2\x80\x99s mill, an\xe2\x80\x99 I doused it, else it \xe2\x80\x99ud set th\xe2\x80\x99 oil alight, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe genelman gen me ten suvreigns; he gen me \xe2\x80\x99em himself last week. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said first, I was a sperrited chap,\xe2\x80\x94but I knowed that afore,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthen he outs wi\xe2\x80\x99 the ten suvreigns, an\xe2\x80\x99 that war summat new. Here they\r\nare, all but one!\xe2\x80\x9d Here Bob emptied the canvas bag on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99d got \xe2\x80\x99em, my head was all of a boil like a kettle o\xe2\x80\x99 broth,\r\nthinkin\xe2\x80\x99 what sort o\xe2\x80\x99 life I should take to, for there war a many\r\ntrades I\xe2\x80\x99d thought on; for as for the barge, I\xe2\x80\x99m clean tired out wi\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nfor it pulls the days out till they\xe2\x80\x99re as long as pigs\xe2\x80\x99 chitterlings.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 I thought first I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 ferrets an\xe2\x80\x99 dogs, an\xe2\x80\x99 be a rat-catcher; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthen I thought as I should like a bigger way o\xe2\x80\x99 life, as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nso well; for I\xe2\x80\x99n seen to the bottom o\xe2\x80\x99 rat-catching; an\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought, till at last I settled I\xe2\x80\x99d be a packman,\xe2\x80\x94for they\xe2\x80\x99re knowin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfellers, the packmen are,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d carry the lightest things I could i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy pack; an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99d be a use for a feller\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, as is no use\r\nneither wi\xe2\x80\x99 rats nor barges. An\xe2\x80\x99 I should go about the country far an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwide, an\xe2\x80\x99 come round the women wi\xe2\x80\x99 my tongue, an\xe2\x80\x99 get my dinner hot at\r\nthe public,\xe2\x80\x94lors! it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a lovely life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob paused, and then said, with defiant decision, as if resolutely\r\nturning his back on that paradisaic picture:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about it, not a chip! An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99n changed one o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsuvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99n bought a blue\r\nplush wescoat, an\xe2\x80\x99 a sealskin cap,\xe2\x80\x94for if I meant to be a packman, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndo it respectable. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about it, not a chip! My yead isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na turnip, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shall p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps have a chance o\xe2\x80\x99 dousing another fire\r\nafore long. I\xe2\x80\x99m a lucky chap. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you to take the nine\r\nsuvreigns, Mr Tom, and set yoursen up with \xe2\x80\x99em somehow, if it\xe2\x80\x99s true as\r\nthe master\xe2\x80\x99s broke. They mayn\xe2\x80\x99t go fur enough, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was touched keenly enough to forget his pride and suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a very kind fellow, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, colouring, with that little\r\ndiffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npride and severity, \xe2\x80\x9cand I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t forget you again, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow you this evening. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t take the nine sovereigns; I should\r\nbe taking your little fortune from you, and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do me much\r\ngood either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they, Mr Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t say so\r\n\xe2\x80\x99cause you think I want \xe2\x80\x99em. I aren\xe2\x80\x99t a poor chap. My mother gets a\r\ngood penn\xe2\x80\x99orth wi\xe2\x80\x99 picking feathers an\xe2\x80\x99 things; an\xe2\x80\x99 if she eats nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut bread-an\xe2\x80\x99-water, it runs to fat. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m such a lucky chap; an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndoubt you aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite so lucky, Mr Tom,\xe2\x80\x94th\xe2\x80\x99 old master isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nanyhow,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 so you might take a slice o\xe2\x80\x99 my luck, an\xe2\x80\x99 no harm done.\r\nLors! I found a leg o\xe2\x80\x99 pork i\xe2\x80\x99 the river one day; it had tumbled out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99 them round-sterned Dutchmen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. Come, think better\r\non it, Mr Tom, for old \xe2\x80\x99quinetance\xe2\x80\x99 sake, else I shall think you bear\r\nme a grudge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob pushed the sovereigns forward, but before Tom could speak Maggie,\r\nclasping her hands, and looking penitently at Bob, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Bob; I never thought you were so good. Why, I think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the kindest person in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which Maggie was\r\nperforming an inward act of penitence, but he smiled with pleasure at\r\nthis handsome eulogy,\xe2\x80\x94especially from a young lass who, as he informed\r\nhis mother that evening, had \xe2\x80\x9csuch uncommon eyes, they looked somehow\r\nas they made him feel nohow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed Bob, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t think I feel\r\nyour kindness less because I say no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take anything from\r\nanybody, but to work my own way. And those sovereigns wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help me\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really\xe2\x80\x94if I were to take them. Let me shake hands\r\nwith you instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom put out his pink palm, and Bob was not slow to place his hard,\r\ngrimy hand within it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me put the sovereigns in the bag again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome and see us when you\xe2\x80\x99ve bought your pack, Bob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like as if I\xe2\x80\x99d come out o\xe2\x80\x99 make believe, o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to show \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, with an air of discontent, as Maggie gave him the bag\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x9ca-taking \xe2\x80\x99em back i\xe2\x80\x99 this way. I _am_ a bit of a Do, you know;\r\nbut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 Do,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y when a feller\xe2\x80\x99s a big rogue, or\r\na big flat, I like to let him in a bit, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be up to any tricks, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9celse you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\ntransported some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; not me, Mr Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, with an air of cheerful confidence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no law again\xe2\x80\x99 flea-bites. If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to take a fool in now\r\nand then, he\xe2\x80\x99d niver get any wiser. But, lors! hev a suvreign to buy\r\nyou and Miss summat, on\xe2\x80\x99y for a token\xe2\x80\x94just to match my pocket-knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Bob was speaking he laid down the sovereign, and resolutely\r\ntwisted up his bag again. Tom pushed back the gold, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nindeed, Bob; thank you heartily, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\xe2\x80\x9d And Maggie,\r\ntaking it between her fingers, held it up to Bob and said, more\r\npersuasively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now, but perhaps another time. If ever Tom or my father wants help\r\nthat you can give, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know; won\xe2\x80\x99t we, Tom? That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nwould like,\xe2\x80\x94to have us always depend on you as a friend that we can go\r\nto,\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss, and thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, reluctantly taking the money;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d like, anything as you like. An\xe2\x80\x99 I wish you good-by,\r\nMiss, and good-luck, Mr Tom, and thank you for shaking hands wi\xe2\x80\x99 me,\r\n_though_ you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKezia\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, with very black looks, to inquire if she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbring in the tea now, or whether the toast was to get hardened to a\r\nbrick, was a seasonable check on Bob\xe2\x80\x99s flux of words, and hastened his\r\nparting bow.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nHow a Hen Takes to Stratagem\r\n\r\nThe days passed, and Mr Tulliver showed, at least to the eyes of the\r\nmedical man, stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his\r\nnormal condition; the paralytic obstruction was, little by little,\r\nlosing its tenacity, and the mind was rising from under it with fitful\r\nstruggles, like a living creature making its way from under a great\r\nsnowdrift, that slides and slides again, and shuts up the newly made\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nTime would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had\r\nonly been measured by the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of\r\nthe moments within the chamber; but it was measured for them by a\r\nfast-approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly. While Mr\r\nTulliver was slowly becoming himself again, his lot was hastening\r\ntoward its moment of most palpable change. The taxing-masters had done\r\ntheir work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the\r\nmusket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will spoil a life or two.\r\nAllocaturs, filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale, are legal\r\nchain-shot or bomb-shells that can never hit a solitary mark, but must\r\nfall with widespread shattering. So deeply inherent is it in this life\r\nof ours that men have to suffer for each other\xe2\x80\x99s sins, so inevitably\r\ndiffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and\r\nwe can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in\r\npulsations of unmerited pain.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out\r\nadvertising the sale, under a decree of Chancery, of Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarming and other stock, to be followed by a sale of the mill and land,\r\nheld in the proper after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion. The miller\r\nhimself, unaware of the lapse of time, fancied himself still in that\r\nfirst stage of his misfortunes when expedients might be thought of; and\r\noften in his conscious hours talked in a feeble, disjointed manner of\r\nplans he would carry out when he \xe2\x80\x9cgot well.\xe2\x80\x9d The wife and children were\r\nnot without hope of an issue that would at least save Mr Tulliver from\r\nleaving the old spot, and seeking an entirely strange life. For uncle\r\nDeane had been induced to interest himself in this stage of the\r\nbusiness. It would not, he acknowledged, be a bad speculation for Guest\r\n& Co. to buy Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the business, which was a good\r\none, and might be increased by the addition of steam power; in which\r\ncase Tulliver might be retained as manager. Still, Mr Deane would say\r\nnothing decided about the matter; the fact that Wakem held the mortgage\r\non the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate, and\r\nfurther, to outbid the cautious firm of Guest & Co., who did not carry\r\non business on sentimental grounds. Mr Deane was obliged to tell Mrs\r\nTulliver something to that effect, when he rode over to the mill to\r\ninspect the books in company with Mrs Glegg; for she had observed that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif Guest &Co. would only think about it, Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s father and\r\ngrandfather had been carrying on Dorlcote Mill long before the oil-mill\r\nof that firm had been so much as thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation\r\nbetween the two mills which would determine their value as investments.\r\nAs for uncle Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond his imagination; the\r\ngood-natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver family, but his\r\nmoney was all locked up in excellent mortgages, and he could run no\r\nrisk; that would be unfair to his own relatives; but he had made up his\r\nmind that Tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats which he had\r\nhimself renounced in favour of a more elastic commodity, and that he\r\nwould buy Mrs Tulliver a pound of tea now and then; it would be a\r\njourney which his benevolence delighted in beforehand, to carry the tea\r\nand see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black.\r\n\r\nStill, it was clear that Mr Deane was kindly disposed toward the\r\nTullivers. One day he had brought Lucy, who was come home for the\r\nChristmas holidays, and the little blond angel-head had pressed itself\r\nagainst Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s darker cheek with many kisses and some tears. These\r\nfair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a\r\nrespectable partner in a respectable firm, and perhaps Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s anxious,\r\npitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle Deane\r\nmore prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse, and in\r\nputting him in the way of getting evening lessons in book-keeping and\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThat might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, if there\r\nhad not come at the same time the much-dreaded blow of finding that his\r\nfather must be a bankrupt, after all; at least, the creditors must be\r\nasked to take less than their due, which to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s untechnical mind was\r\nthe same thing as bankruptcy. His father must not only be said to have\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clost his property,\xe2\x80\x9d but to have \xe2\x80\x9cfailed,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the word that carried the\r\nworst obloquy to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind. For when the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim for costs\r\nhad been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr Gore,\r\nand the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would\r\nmake the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; \xe2\x80\x9cnot more than\r\nten or twelve shillings in the pound,\xe2\x80\x9d predicted Mr Deane, in a decided\r\ntone, tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like a scalding\r\nliquied, leaving a continual smart.\r\n\r\nHe was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in\r\nthe unpleasant newness of his position,\xe2\x80\x94suddenly transported from the\r\neasy carpeted _ennui_ of study-hours at Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s, and the busy\r\nidleness of castle-building in a \xe2\x80\x9clast half\xe2\x80\x9d at school, to the\r\ncompanionship of sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down heavy\r\nweights at his elbow. The first step toward getting on in the world was\r\na chill, dusty, noisy affair, and implied going without one\xe2\x80\x99s tea in\r\norder to stay in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s and have an evening lesson from a one-armed\r\nelderly clerk, in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\npink-and-white face had its colours very much deadened by the time he\r\ntook off his hat at home, and sat down with keen hunger to his supper.\r\nNo wonder he was a little cross if his mother or Maggie spoke to him.\r\n\r\nBut all this while Mrs Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which\r\nshe, and no one else, would avert the result most to be dreaded, and\r\nprevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill.\r\nImagine a truly respectable and amiable hen, by some portentous\r\nanomaly, taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she\r\nmight prevail on Hodge not to wring her neck, or send her and her\r\nchicks to market; the result could hardly be other than much cackling\r\nand fluttering. Mrs Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong,\r\nhad begun to think she had been too passive in life; and that, if she\r\nhad applied her mind to business, and taken a strong resolution now and\r\nthen, it would have been all the better for her and her family. Nobody,\r\nit appeared, had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of\r\nthe mill; and yet, Mrs Tulliver reflected, it would have been quite the\r\nshortest method of securing the right end. It would have been of no\r\nuse, to be sure, for Mr Tulliver to go,\xe2\x80\x94even if he had been able and\r\nwilling,\xe2\x80\x94for he had been \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to law against Wakem\xe2\x80\x9d and abusing him\r\nfor the last ten years; Wakem was always likely to have a spite against\r\nhim. And now that Mrs Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her\r\nhusband was very much in the wrong to bring her into this trouble, she\r\nwas inclined to think that his opinion of Wakem was wrong too. To be\r\nsure, Wakem had \xe2\x80\x9cput the bailies in the house, and sold them up\xe2\x80\x9d; but\r\nshe supposed he did that to please the man that lent Mr Tulliver the\r\nmoney, for a lawyer had more folks to please than one, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlikely to put Mr Tulliver, who had gone to law with him, above\r\neverybody else in the world. The attorney might be a very reasonable\r\nman; why not? He had married a Miss Clint, and at the time Mrs Tulliver\r\nhad heard of that marriage, the summer when she wore her blue satin\r\nspencer, and had not yet any thoughts of Mr Tulliver, she knew no harm\r\nof Wakem. And certainly toward herself, whom he knew to have been a\r\nMiss Dodson, it was out of all possibility that he could entertain\r\nanything but good-will, when it was once brought home to his\r\nobservation that she, for her part, had never wanted to go to law, and\r\nindeed was at present disposed to take Mr Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s view of all subjects\r\nrather than her husband\xe2\x80\x99s. In fact, if that attorney saw a respectable\r\nmatron like herself disposed \xe2\x80\x9cto give him good words,\xe2\x80\x9d why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nlisten to her representations? For she would put the matter clearly\r\nbefore him, which had never been done yet. And he would never go and\r\nbid for the mill on purpose to spite her, an innocent woman, who\r\nthought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at\r\nSquire Darleigh\xe2\x80\x99s, for at those big dances she had often and often\r\ndanced with young men whose names she had forgotten.\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom; for when she had\r\nthrown out a hint to Mr Deane and Mr Glegg that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind going\r\nto speak to Wakem herself, they had said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPooh,\r\npooh,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLet Wakem alone,\xe2\x80\x9d in the tone of men who were not likely to\r\ngive a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her project;\r\nstill less dared she mention the plan to Tom and Maggie, for \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nchildren were always so against everything their mother said\xe2\x80\x9d; and Tom,\r\nshe observed, was almost as much set against Wakem as his father was.\r\nBut this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave Mrs Tulliver\r\nan unusual power of device and determination: and a day or two before\r\nthe sale, to be held at the Golden Lion, when there was no longer any\r\ntime to be lost, she carried out her plan by a stratagem. There were\r\npickles in question, a large stock of pickles and ketchup which Mrs\r\nTulliver possessed, and which Mr Hyndmarsh, the grocer, would certainly\r\npurchase if she could transact the business in a personal interview, so\r\nshe would walk with Tom to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s that morning; and when Tom urged\r\nthat she might let the pickles be at present,\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like her to go\r\nabout just yet,\xe2\x80\x94she appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son,\r\ncontradicting her about pickles which she had made after the family\r\nreceipts inherited from his own grandmother, who had died when his\r\nmother was a little girl, that he gave way, and they walked together\r\nuntil she turned toward Danish Street, where Mr Hyndmarsh retailed his\r\ngrocery, not far from the offices of Mr Wakem.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was not yet come to his office; would Mrs Tulliver sit\r\ndown by the fire in his private room and wait for him? She had not long\r\nto wait before the punctual attorney entered, knitting his brow with an\r\nexamining glance at the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying\r\ndeferentially,\xe2\x80\x94a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant\r\niron-gray hair. You have never seen Mr Wakem before, and are possibly\r\nwondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal, and as crafty,\r\nbitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of Mr Tulliver in\r\nparticular, as he is represented to be in that eidolon or portrait of\r\nhim which we have seen to exist in the miller\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any\r\nchance-shot that grazed him as an attempt on his own life, and was\r\nliable to entanglements in this puzzling world, which, due\r\nconsideration had to his own infallibility, required the hypothesis of\r\na very active diabolical agency to explain them. It is still possible\r\nto believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him than an\r\ningenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is\r\nguilty toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by\r\nsome fly-wheel or other, and suddenly converted into unexpected\r\nmince-meat.\r\n\r\nBut it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his\r\nperson; the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other\r\nsymbols,\xe2\x80\x94not always easy to read without a key. On an _a priori_ view\r\nof Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s aquiline nose, which offended Mr Tulliver, there was not\r\nmore rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirt-collar, though this\r\ntoo along with his nose, might have become fraught with damnatory\r\nmeaning when once the rascality was ascertained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Tulliver, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wakem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray be seated. You have some business with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, beginning to feel alarmed at her\r\nown courage, now she was really in presence of the formidable man, and\r\nreflecting that she had not settled with herself how she should begin.\r\nMr Wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets, and looked at her in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she began at last,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a-thinking\r\nas _I_ bear you any ill-will because o\xe2\x80\x99 my husband\xe2\x80\x99s losing his\r\nlawsuit, and the bailies being put in, and the linen being sold,\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x94for I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up in that way. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you remember my\r\nfather, sir, for he was close friends with Squire Darleigh, and we\r\nallays went to the dances there, the Miss Dodsons,\xe2\x80\x94nobody could be more\r\nlooked on,\xe2\x80\x94and justly, for there was four of us, and you\xe2\x80\x99re quite aware\r\nas Mrs Glegg and Mrs Deane are my sisters. And as for going to law and\r\nlosing money, and having sales before you\xe2\x80\x99re dead, I never saw anything\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 that before I was married, nor for a long while after. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nto be answerable for my bad luck i\xe2\x80\x99 marrying out o\xe2\x80\x99 my own family into\r\none where the goings-on was different. And as for being drawn in t\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabuse you as other folks abuse you, sir, _that_ I niver was, and nobody\r\ncan say it of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver shook her head a little, and looked at the hem of her\r\npocket handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt of what you say, Mrs Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wakem, with cold\r\npoliteness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have some question to ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, yes. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to myself,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhad some nat\xe2\x80\x99ral feeling; and as for my husband, as hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been himself\r\nfor this two months, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a-defending him, in no way, for being so\r\nhot about th\xe2\x80\x99 erigation,\xe2\x80\x94not but what there\xe2\x80\x99s worse men, for he never\r\nwronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny, not willingly; and as for his\r\nfieriness and lawing, what could I do? And him struck as if it was with\r\ndeath when he got the letter as said you\xe2\x80\x99d the hold upo\xe2\x80\x99 the land. But\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe but what you\xe2\x80\x99ll behave as a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does all this mean, Mrs Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wakem rather sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, starting a little,\r\nand speaking more hurriedly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good not to buy the mill\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 the land,\xe2\x80\x94the land wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter, only my husband ull\xe2\x80\x99 be\r\nlike mad at your having it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething like a new thought flashed across Mr Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s face as he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you I meant to buy it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s none o\xe2\x80\x99 my inventing, and I should never ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought of\r\nit; for my husband, as ought to know about the law, he allays used to\r\nsay as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,\xe2\x80\x94either lands or\r\nhouses,\xe2\x80\x94for they allays got \xe2\x80\x99em into their hands other ways. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nshould think that \xe2\x80\x99ud be the way with you, sir; and I niver said as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d be the man to do contrairy to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, who was it that _did_ say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, opening his desk,\r\nand moving things about, with the accompaniment of an almost inaudible\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir, it was Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, as have all the management;\r\nand Mr Deane thinks as Guest &Co. \xe2\x80\x99ud buy the mill and let Mr Tulliver\r\nwork it for \xe2\x80\x99em, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t bid for it and raise the price. And it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is, if he could get\r\nhis living: for it was his father\xe2\x80\x99s before him, the mill was, and his\r\ngrandfather built it, though I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fond o\xe2\x80\x99 the noise of it, when\r\nfirst I was married, for there was no mills in our family,\xe2\x80\x94not the\r\nDodson\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94and if I\xe2\x80\x99d known as the mills had so much to do with the law,\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been me as \xe2\x80\x99ud have been the first Dodson to marry\r\none; but I went into it blindfold, that I did, erigation and\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Guest &Co. would keep the mill in their own hands, I suppose,\r\nand pay your husband wages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs Tulliver, a little\r\ntear making its way, \xe2\x80\x9cas my husband should take wage. But it \xe2\x80\x99ud look\r\nmore like what used to be, to stay at the mill than to go anywhere\r\nelse; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only think\xe2\x80\x94if you was to bid for the mill and buy\r\nit, my husband might be struck worse than he was before, and niver get\r\nbetter again as he\xe2\x80\x99s getting now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my\r\nmanager in the same way, how then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wakem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I doubt he could niver be got to do it, not if the very mill\r\nstood still to beg and pray of him. For your name\xe2\x80\x99s like poison to him,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so as never was; and he looks upon it as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been the ruin of\r\nhim all along, ever since you set the law on him about the road through\r\nthe meadow,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s eight year ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been going on ever since\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve allays told him he was wrong\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a pig-headed, foul-mouthed fool!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Mr Wakem, forgetting\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, frightened at a result so different\r\nfrom the one she had fixed her mind on; \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to contradict\r\nyou, but it\xe2\x80\x99s like enough he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind with this illness,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforgot a many things he used to talk about. And you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nhave a corpse on your mind, if he was to die; and they _do_ say as it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallays unlucky when Dorlcote Mill changes hands, and the water might\r\nall run away, and _then_\xe2\x80\x94not as I\xe2\x80\x99m wishing you any ill-luck, sir, for\r\nI forgot to tell you as I remember your wedding as if it was yesterday;\r\nMrs Wakem was a Miss Clint, I know _that;_ and my boy, as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nnicer, handsomer, straighter boy nowhere, went to school with your\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Wakem rose, opened the door, and called to one of his clerks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs Tulliver; I have business\r\nthat must be attended to; and I think there is nothing more necessary\r\nto be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you _would_ bear it in mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, rising,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not run against me and my children; and I\xe2\x80\x99m not denying Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s been in the wrong, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been punished enough, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s worse men, for it\xe2\x80\x99s been giving to other folks has been his\r\nfault. He\xe2\x80\x99s done nobody any harm but himself and his family,\xe2\x80\x94the more\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe pity,\xe2\x80\x94and I go and look at the bare shelves every day, and think\r\nwhere all my things used to stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear it in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wakem, hastily, looking\r\ntoward the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you\xe2\x80\x99d please not to say as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to speak to you, for my\r\nson \xe2\x80\x99ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself, I know he would,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve trouble enough without being scolded by my children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled a little, and she could make no\r\nanswer to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d but curtsied and walked out in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Wakem to his clerk when they were alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext Friday is the day,\xe2\x80\x94Friday at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just run to Winship\xe2\x80\x99s the auctioneer, and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s at home. I\r\nhave some business for him; ask him to come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough, when Mr Wakem entered his office that morning, he had had no\r\nintention of purchasing Dorlcote Mill, his mind was already made up.\r\nMrs Tulliver had suggested to him several determining motives, and his\r\nmental glance was very rapid; he was one of those men who can be prompt\r\nwithout being rash, because their motives run in fixed tracks, and they\r\nhave no need to reconcile conflicting aims.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward\r\nTulliver that Tulliver had toward him would be like supposing that a\r\npike and a roach can look at each other from a similar point of view.\r\nThe roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his\r\nliving, and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the\r\nmost indignant roach than that he is excellent good eating; it could\r\nonly be when the roach choked him that the pike could entertain a\r\nstrong personal animosity. If Mr Tulliver had ever seriously injured or\r\nthwarted the attorney, Wakem would not have refused him the distinction\r\nof being a special object of his vindictiveness. But when Mr Tulliver\r\ncalled Wakem a rascal at the market dinner-table, the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nclients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him;\r\nand if, when Wakem himself happened to be present, some jocose\r\ncattle-feeder, stimulated by opportunity and brandy, made a thrust at\r\nhim by alluding to old ladies\xe2\x80\x99 wills, he maintained perfect _sang\r\nfroid_, and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men then\r\npresent were perfectly contented with the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cWakem was Wakem\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nthat is to say, a man who always knew the stepping-stones that would\r\ncarry him through very muddy bits of practice. A man who had made a\r\nlarge fortune, had a handsome house among the trees at Tofton, and\r\ndecidedly the finest stock of port-wine in the neighbourhood of St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion. And I\r\nam not sure that even honest Mr Tulliver himself, with his general view\r\nof law as a cockpit, might not, under opposite circumstances, have seen\r\na fine appropriateness in the truth that \xe2\x80\x9cWakem was Wakem\xe2\x80\x9d; since I\r\nhave understood from persons versed in history, that mankind is not\r\ndisposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when their\r\nvictory is on the right side. Tulliver, then, could be no obstruction\r\nto Wakem; on the contrary, he was a poor devil whom the lawyer had\r\ndefeated several times; a hot-tempered fellow, who would always give\r\nyou a handle against him. Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s conscience was not uneasy because he\r\nhad used a few tricks against the miller; why should he hate that\r\nunsuccessful plaintiff, that pitiable, furious bull entangled in the\r\nmeshes of a net?\r\n\r\nStill, among the various excesses to which human nature is subject,\r\nmoralists have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who\r\nopenly revile us. The successful Yellow candidate for the borough of\r\nOld Topping, perhaps, feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the\r\nBlue editor who consoles his subscribers with vituperative rhetoric\r\nagainst Yellow men who sell their country, and are the demons of\r\nprivate life; but he might not be sorry, if law and opportunity\r\nfavoured, to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his favourite\r\ncolour. Prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then, as they\r\ntake a diversion, when it comes easily in their way, and is no\r\nhindrance to business; and such small unimpassioned revenges have an\r\nenormous effect in life, running through all degrees of pleasant\r\ninfliction, blocking the fit men out of places, and blackening\r\ncharacters in unpremeditated talk. Still more, to see people who have\r\nbeen only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and\r\nhumiliated, without any special effort of ours, is apt to have a\r\nsoothing, flattering influence. Providence or some other prince of this\r\nworld, it appears, has undertaken the task of retribution for us; and\r\nreally, by an agreeable constitution of things, our enemies somehow\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ prosper.\r\n\r\nWakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the\r\nuncomplimentary miller; and now Mrs Tulliver had put the notion into\r\nhis head, it presented itself to him as a pleasure to do the very thing\r\nthat would cause Mr Tulliver the most deadly mortification,\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\npleasure of a complex kind, not made up of crude malice, but mingling\r\nwith it the relish of self-approbation. To see an enemy humiliated\r\ngives a certain contentment, but this is jejune compared with the\r\nhighly blent satisfaction of seeing him humiliated by your benevolent\r\naction or concession on his behalf. That is a sort of revenge which\r\nfalls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was not without an intention\r\nof keeping that scale respectably filled. He had once had the pleasure\r\nof putting an old enemy of his into one of the St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s alms-houses, to\r\nthe rebuilding of which he had given a large subscription; and here was\r\nan opportunity of providing for another by making him his own servant.\r\nSuch things give a completeness to prosperity, and contribute elements\r\nof agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that\r\nshort-sighted, overheated vindictiveness which goes out its way to\r\nwreak itself in direct injury. And Tulliver, with his rough tongue\r\nfiled by a sense of obligation, would make a better servant than any\r\nchance-fellow who was cap-in-hand for a situation. Tulliver was known\r\nto be a man of proud honesty, and Wakem was too acute not to believe in\r\nthe existence of honesty. He was given to observing individuals, not\r\nto judging of them according to maxims, and no one knew better than he\r\nthat all men were not like himself. Besides, he intended to overlook\r\nthe whole business of land and mill pretty closely; he was fond of\r\nthese practical rural matters. But there were good reasons for\r\npurchasing Dorlcote Mill, quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on\r\nthe miller. It was really a capital investment; besides, Guest &Co.\r\nwere going to bid for it. Mr Guest and Mr Wakem were on friendly dining\r\nterms, and the attorney liked to predominate over a ship-owner and\r\nmill-owner who was a little too loud in the town affairs as well as in\r\nhis table-talk. For Wakem was not a mere man of business; he was\r\nconsidered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94chatted\r\namusingly over his port-wine, did a little amateur farming, and had\r\ncertainly been an excellent husband and father; at church, when he went\r\nthere, he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments erected to the\r\nmemory of his wife. Most men would have married again under his\r\ncircumstances, but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son\r\nthan most men were to their best-shapen offspring. Not that Mr Wakem\r\nhad not other sons beside Philip; but toward them he held only a\r\nchiaroscuro parentage, and provided for them in a grade of life duly\r\nbeneath his own. In this fact, indeed, there lay the clenching motive\r\nto the purchase of Dorlcote Mill. While Mrs Tulliver was talking, it\r\nhad occurred to the rapid-minded lawyer, among all the other\r\ncircumstances of the case, that this purchase would, in a few years to\r\ncome, furnish a highly suitable position for a certain favourite lad\r\nwhom he meant to bring on in the world.\r\n\r\nThese were the mental conditions on which Mrs Tulliver had undertaken\r\nto act persuasively, and had failed; a fact which may receive some\r\nillustration from the remark of a great philosopher, that fly-fishers\r\nfail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right\r\nquarter, for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nDaylight on the Wreck\r\n\r\nIt was a clear frosty January day on which Mr Tulliver first came\r\ndownstairs. The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs\r\nopposite his window had made him impatiently declare that he would be\r\ncaged up no longer; he thought everywhere would be more cheery under\r\nthis sunshine than his bedroom; for he knew nothing of the bareness\r\nbelow, which made the flood of sunshine importunate, as if it had an\r\nunfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks where\r\nwell-known objects once had been. The impression on his mind that it\r\nwas but yesterday when he received the letter from Mr Gore was so\r\ncontinually implied in his talk, and the attempts to convey to him the\r\nidea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had\r\nbeen so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr\r\nTurnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by\r\nprevious knowledge. The full sense of the present could only be\r\nimparted gradually by new experience,\xe2\x80\x94not by mere words, which must\r\nremain weaker than the impressions left by the _old_ experience. This\r\nresolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and\r\nchildren. Mrs Tulliver said Tom must not go to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s at the usual\r\nhour, he must wait and see his father downstairs; and Tom complied,\r\nthough with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The\r\nhearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the\r\nlast few days. For Guest &Co. had not bought the mill; both mill and\r\nland had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises,\r\nand had laid before Mr Deane and Mr Glegg, in Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nhis willingness to employ Mr Tulliver, in case of his recovery, as a\r\nmanager of the business. This proposition had occasioned much family\r\ndebating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such\r\nan offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but\r\na feeling in Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles\r\nshared it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish,\xe2\x80\x94indeed,\r\nas a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr\r\nTulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his\r\ngeneral quarrelsomeness, and his special exhibition of it in going to\r\nlaw. Here was an opportunity for Mr Tulliver to provide for his wife\r\nand daughter without any assistance from his wife\xe2\x80\x99s relations, and\r\nwithout that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying\r\nto respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the\r\nwayside. Mr Tulliver, Mrs Glegg considered, must be made to feel, when\r\nhe came to his right mind, that he could never humble himself enough;\r\nfor _that_ had come which she had always foreseen would come of his\r\ninsolence in time past \xe2\x80\x9cto them as were the best friends he\xe2\x80\x99d got to\r\nlook to.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Glegg and Mr Deane were less stern in their views, but\r\nthey both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his\r\nhot-tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a\r\nlivelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a right feeling about the\r\nmatter,\xe2\x80\x94_he_ had no grudge against Tulliver.\r\n\r\nTom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike his father to be under Wakem; he thought it would look\r\nmean-spirited; but his mother\xe2\x80\x99s main distress was the utter\r\nimpossibility of ever \xe2\x80\x9cturning Mr Tulliver round about Wakem,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\ngetting him to hear reason; no, they would all have to go and live in a\r\npigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke \xe2\x80\x9cso as nobody could be\r\nfairer.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s mind was reduced to such confusion by\r\nliving in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow, against which\r\nshe continually appealed by asking, \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, what _have_ I done to\r\ndeserve worse than other women?\xe2\x80\x9d that Maggie began to suspect her poor\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s wits were quite going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when they were out of their father\xe2\x80\x99s room together,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe _must_ try to make father understand a little of what has happened\r\nbefore he goes downstairs. But we must get my mother away. She will say\r\nsomething that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her down, and keep her\r\nengaged with something in the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKezia was equal to the task. Having declared her intention of staying\r\ntill the master could get about again, \xe2\x80\x9cwage or no wage,\xe2\x80\x9d she had found\r\na certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress,\r\nscolding her for \xe2\x80\x9cmoithering\xe2\x80\x9d herself, and going about all day without\r\nchanging her cap, and looking as if she was \xe2\x80\x9cmushed.\xe2\x80\x9d Altogether, this\r\ntime of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold\r\nher betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there\r\nwere drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of\r\nhands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that _she_\r\nshould have thought it would be good for Mrs Tulliver to put on her\r\nbonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of\r\nwork. Poor Mrs Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered\r\nabout by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwould soon have no servant to scold her. Mr Tulliver was resting in his\r\nchair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and Maggie and Tom were\r\nseated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver pointing his\r\nstick toward a chair, and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which\r\nconvalescent persons often have for those who have tended them,\r\nreminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had\r\nbeen a constant night-watcher by his master\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the water now, eh, Luke?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cDix hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nchoking you up again, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I thought not; he won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry at that again, now Riley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen to settle him. That was what I said to Riley yesterday\xe2\x80\x94I said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver leaned forward, resting his elbows on the armchair, and\r\nlooking on the ground as if in search of something, striving after\r\nvanishing images like a man struggling against a doze. Maggie looked at\r\nTom in mute distress, their father\xe2\x80\x99s mind was so far off the present,\r\nwhich would by-and-by thrust itself on his wandering consciousness! Tom\r\nwas almost ready to rush away, with that impatience of painful emotion\r\nwhich makes one of the differences between youth and maiden, man and\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, laying her hand on his, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember that\r\nMr Riley is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, sharply, looking in her face with a strange,\r\nexamining glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you say\r\nyou had to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; one\r\nof them is under-teacher at Miss Firniss\xe2\x80\x99s, where I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to school,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, doubtfully, still looking in her face. But as\r\nsoon as Tom began to speak he turned to look at _him_ with the same\r\ninquiring glances, as if he were rather surprised at the presence of\r\nthese two young people. Whenever his mind was wandering in the far\r\npast, he fell into this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not\r\nthose of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long while since you had the dispute with Dix, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTom. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember your talking about it three years ago, before I went\r\nto school at Mr Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at school there three years;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike outward\r\nglance under a rush of new ideas, which diverted him from external\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a minute or two, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve paid a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 money\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas determined my son should have a good eddication; I\xe2\x80\x99d none myself,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt the miss of it. And he\xe2\x80\x99ll want no other fortin, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I say\xe2\x80\x94if Wakem was to get the better of me again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause\r\nhe began to look at the coat he had on, and to feel in his side-pocket.\r\nThen he turned to Tom, and said in his old sharp way, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have they\r\nput Gore\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what there is in the letter, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, as he gave it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, rather angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99 that? If\r\nFurley can\xe2\x80\x99t take to the property, somebody else can; there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npeople in the world besides Furley. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hindering\xe2\x80\x94my not being\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94go and tell \xe2\x80\x99em to get the horse in the gig, Luke; I can get down\r\nto St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s well enough\xe2\x80\x94Gore\xe2\x80\x99s expecting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear father!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie burst out entreatingly; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a very long\r\nwhile since all that; you\xe2\x80\x99ve been ill a great many weeks,\xe2\x80\x94more than two\r\nmonths; everything is changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze;\r\nthe idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often\r\ntransiently arrested him before, but it came upon him now with entire\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in answer to the gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble\r\nyour mind about business until you are quite well; everything is\r\nsettled about that for the present,\xe2\x80\x94about the mill and the land and the\r\ndebts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s settled, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you take on too much bout it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 paid\r\niverybody if you could,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said to Master Tom,\xe2\x80\x94I said you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 paid iverybody if you could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose\r\nlives have been spent in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in\r\nrank which made his master\xe2\x80\x99s downfall a tragedy to him. He was urged,\r\nin his slow way, to say something that would express his share in the\r\nfamily sorrow; and these words, which he had used over and over again\r\nto Tom when he wanted to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds\r\nout of the children\xe2\x80\x99s money, were the most ready to his tongue. They\r\nwere just the words to lay the most painful hold on his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbewildered mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaid everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with vehement agitation, his face flushing,\r\nand his eye lighting up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94have they made me a _bankrupt?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, dear father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, who thought that terrible word\r\nreally represented the fact; \xe2\x80\x9cbear it well, because we love you; your\r\nchildren will always love you. Tom will pay them all; he says he will,\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt her father beginning to tremble; his voice trembled too, as he\r\nsaid, after a few moments:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o\xe2\x80\x99er.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\r\nspeaking with a great effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, shaking his head slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbroke can never be whole again; it \xe2\x80\x99ud be your doing, not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nlooking up at him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re only sixteen; it\xe2\x80\x99s an up-hill fight for you,\r\nbut you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t throw it at your father; the raskills have been too\r\nmany for him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you a good eddication,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll start you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in his throat half choked the last words; the flush, which\r\nhad alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence\r\nof paralysis, had subsided, and his face looked pale and tremulous. Tom\r\nsaid nothing; he was still struggling against his inclination to rush\r\naway. His father remained quiet a minute or two, but his mind did not\r\nseem to be wandering again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they sold me up, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said more calmly, as if he were\r\npossessed simply by the desire to know what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is sold, father; but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know all about the mill and\r\nthe land yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, anxious to ward off any question leading to\r\nthe fact that Wakem was the purchaser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs,\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s your chair and the bureau; _they\xe2\x80\x99re_\r\nnot gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go; help me down, Luke,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nTulliver, leaning on his stick, and stretching out his other hand\r\ntoward Luke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, as he gave his arm to his master, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll make up\r\nyour mind to\xe2\x80\x99t a bit better when you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen iverything; you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nused to\xe2\x80\x99t. That\xe2\x80\x99s what my mother says about her shortness o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbreath,\xe2\x80\x94she says she\xe2\x80\x99s made friends wi\xe2\x80\x99t now, though she fought again\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit sore when it just come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlour,\r\nwhere the fire, dulled by the frosty sunshine, seemed part of the\r\ngeneral shabbiness. She turned her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and pushed aside the\r\ntable to make an easy way for him, and then stood with a beating heart\r\nto see him enter and look round for the first time. Tom advanced before\r\nhim, carrying the leg-rest, and stood beside Maggie on the hearth. Of\r\nthose two young hearts Tom\xe2\x80\x99s suffered the most unmixed pain, for\r\nMaggie, with all her keen susceptibility, yet felt as if the sorrow\r\nmade larger room for her love to flow in, and gave breathing-space to\r\nher passionate nature. No true boy feels that; he would rather go and\r\nslay the Nemean lion, or perform any round of heroic labours, than\r\nendure perpetual appeals to his pity, for evils over which he can make\r\nno conquest.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking\r\nround him at all the bare places, which for him were filled with the\r\nshadows of departed objects,\xe2\x80\x94the daily companions of his life. His\r\nfaculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing\r\non this demonstration of the senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, moving toward his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve sold me\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve sold me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen seating himself, and laying down his stick, while Luke left the\r\nroom, he looked round again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve left the big Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got everything in,\xe2\x80\x94when I\r\nwas born and married; bring it me, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe quarto Bible was laid open before him at the fly-leaf, and while he\r\nwas reading with slowly travelling eyes Mrs Tulliver entered the room,\r\nbut stood in mute surprise to find her husband down already, and with\r\nthe great Bible before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at a spot where his finger rested, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\r\nwas Margaret Beaton; she died when she was forty-seven,\xe2\x80\x94hers wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nlong-lived family; we\xe2\x80\x99re our mother\xe2\x80\x99s children, Gritty and me are,\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nshall go to our last bed before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be pausing over the record of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s birth and\r\nmarriage, as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him; then he\r\nsuddenly looked up at Tom, and said, in a sharp tone of alarm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t come upo\xe2\x80\x99 Moss for the money as I lent him, have they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cthe note was burnt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver turned his eyes on the page again, and presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94Elizabeth Dodson\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s eighteen year since I married her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome next Ladyday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, going up to his side and\r\nlooking at the page.\r\n\r\nHer husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou was a pretty lass then,\xe2\x80\x94everybody said\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x94and I used to think you kept your good looks rarely. But you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsorely aged; don\xe2\x80\x99t you bear me ill-will\xe2\x80\x94I meant to do well by you\xe2\x80\x94we\r\npromised one another for better or for worse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never thought it \xe2\x80\x99ud be so for worse as this,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs\r\nTulliver, with the strange, scared look that had come over her of late;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand my poor father gave me away\xe2\x80\x94and to come on so all at once\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t let your poor mother speak\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s been the way\r\nall my life\xe2\x80\x94your father never minded what I said\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x99ud have been o\xe2\x80\x99 no\r\nuse for me to beg and pray\xe2\x80\x94and it \xe2\x80\x99ud be no use now, not if I was to go\r\ndown o\xe2\x80\x99 my hands and knees\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, whose pride, in these first\r\nmoments of humiliation, was in abeyance to the sense of some justice in\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anything left as I could do to make\r\nyou amends, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say you nay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we might stay here and get a living, and I might keep among my\r\nown sisters,\xe2\x80\x94and me been such a good wife to you, and never crossed you\r\nfrom week\xe2\x80\x99s end to week\xe2\x80\x99s end\xe2\x80\x94and they all say so\xe2\x80\x94they say it \xe2\x80\x99ud be\r\nnothing but right, only you\xe2\x80\x99re so turned against Wakem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not the time to talk about\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cSay what you mean, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, now the mill and the land\xe2\x80\x99s all Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got everything\r\nin his hands, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 setting your face against him, when he\r\nsays you may stay here, and speaks as fair as can be, and says you may\r\nmanage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse to\r\nride about to market? And where have we got to put our heads? We must\r\ngo into one o\xe2\x80\x99 the cottages in the village,\xe2\x80\x94and me and my children\r\nbrought down to that,\xe2\x80\x94and all because you must set your mind against\r\nfolks till there\xe2\x80\x99s no turning you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may do as you like wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen the bringing of you to poverty\xe2\x80\x94this world\xe2\x80\x99s too many for me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnought but a bankrupt; it\xe2\x80\x99s no use standing up for anything now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with my mother or my uncles, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to submit to be under Wakem. I get a pound a-week\r\nnow, and you can find something else to do when you get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more, Tom, say no more; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough for this day. Give me a\r\nkiss, Bessy, and let us bear one another no ill-will; we shall never be\r\nyoung again\xe2\x80\x94this world\xe2\x80\x99s been too many for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nAn Item Added to the Family Register\r\n\r\nThat first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days\r\nof violent struggle in the miller\xe2\x80\x99s mind, as the gradual access of\r\nbodily strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one\r\nview all the conflicting conditions under which he found himself.\r\nFeeble limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered, and when we are\r\nsubdued by sickness it seems possible to us to fulfil pledges which the\r\nold vigor comes back and breaks. There were times when poor Tulliver\r\nthought the fulfilment of his promise to Bessy was something quite too\r\nhard for human nature; he had promised her without knowing what she was\r\ngoing to say,\xe2\x80\x94she might as well have asked him to carry a ton weight on\r\nhis back. But again, there were many feelings arguing on her side,\r\nbesides the sense that life had been made hard to her by having married\r\nhim. He saw a possibility, by much pinching, of saving money out of his\r\nsalary toward paying a second dividend to his creditors, and it would\r\nnot be easy elsewhere to get a situation such as he could fill.\r\n\r\nHe had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no\r\naptitude for any new business. He must perhaps take to day-labour, and\r\nhis wife must have help from her sisters,\xe2\x80\x94a prospect doubly bitter to\r\nhim, now they had let all Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s precious things be sold, probably\r\nbecause they liked to set her against him, by making her feel that he\r\nhad brought her to that pass. He listened to their admonitory talk,\r\nwhen they came to urge on him what he was bound to do for poor Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, with averted eyes, that every now and then flashed on them\r\nfurtively when their backs were turned. Nothing but the dread of\r\nneeding their help could have made it an easier alternative to take\r\ntheir advice.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises\r\nwhere he had run about when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after\r\nhim. The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations, and he had\r\nsat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked\r\nof the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the last great\r\nfloods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and\r\nbuilt the new one. It was when he got able to walk about and look at\r\nall the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection\r\nfor the old home as part of his life, part of himself. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nto think of himself living on any other spot than this, where he knew\r\nthe sound of every gate door, and felt that the shape and colour of\r\nevery roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his\r\ngrowing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed vagrancy, which has\r\nhardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the\r\ntropics, and is at home with palms and banyans,\xe2\x80\x94which is nourished on\r\nbooks of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the\r\nZambesi,\xe2\x80\x94can hardly get a dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like\r\nTulliver felt for this spot, where all his memories centred, and where\r\nlife seemed like a familiar smooth-handled tool that the fingers clutch\r\nwith loving ease. And just now he was living in that freshened memory\r\nof the far-off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery\r\nfrom sickness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Luke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said one afternoon, as he stood looking over the orchard\r\ngate, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember the day they planted those apple-trees. My father was\r\na huge man for planting,\xe2\x80\x94it was like a merry-making to him to get a\r\ncart full o\xe2\x80\x99 young trees; and I used to stand i\xe2\x80\x99 the cold with him, and\r\nfollow him about like a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the\r\nopposite buildings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old mill \xe2\x80\x99ud miss me, I think, Luke. There\xe2\x80\x99s a story as when the\r\nmill changes hands, the river\xe2\x80\x99s angry; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard my father say it many\r\na time. There\xe2\x80\x99s no telling whether there mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be summat _in_ the\r\nstory, for this is a puzzling world, and Old Harry\xe2\x80\x99s got a finger in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s been too many for me, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, with soothing sympathy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat wi\xe2\x80\x99 the rust on the\r\nwheat, an\xe2\x80\x99 the firin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the ricks an\xe2\x80\x99 that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x94things often looks comical; there\xe2\x80\x99s the bacon fat wi\xe2\x80\x99 our last\r\npig run away like butter,\xe2\x80\x94it leaves nought but a scratchin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as if it was yesterday, now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Tulliver went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen my\r\nfather began the malting. I remember, the day they finished the\r\nmalt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it; for we\xe2\x80\x99d a\r\nplum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x94she was a fine dark-eyed woman, my mother was,\xe2\x80\x94the little wench\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull be as like her as two peas.\xe2\x80\x9d Here Mr Tulliver put his stick\r\nbetween his legs, and took out his snuff-box, for the greater enjoyment\r\nof this anecdote, which dropped from him in fragments, as if he every\r\nother moment lost narration in vision. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a little chap no higher\r\nmuch than my mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee,\xe2\x80\x94she was sore fond of us children, Gritty\r\nand me,\xe2\x80\x94and so I said to her, \xe2\x80\x98Mother,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98shall we have\r\nplum-pudding _every_ day because o\xe2\x80\x99 the malt-house? She used to tell me\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 that till her dying day. She was but a young woman when she died, my\r\nmother was. But it\xe2\x80\x99s forty good year since they finished the\r\nmalt-house, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t many days out of \xe2\x80\x99em all as I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked\r\nout into the yard there, the first thing in the morning,\xe2\x80\x94all weathers,\r\nfrom year\xe2\x80\x99s end to year\xe2\x80\x99s end. I should go off my head in a new place.\r\nI should be like as if I\xe2\x80\x99d lost my way. It\xe2\x80\x99s all hard, whichever way I\r\nlook at it,\xe2\x80\x94the harness \xe2\x80\x99ull gall me, but it \xe2\x80\x99ud be summat to draw\r\nalong the old road, instead of a new un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d be a deal better here nor in some new\r\nplace. I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide new places mysen: things is allays\r\nawk\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x94narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all another\r\nsort, an\xe2\x80\x99 oat-cake i\xe2\x80\x99 some places, tow\xe2\x80\x99rt th\xe2\x80\x99 head o\xe2\x80\x99 the Floss, there.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s poor work, changing your country-side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I doubt, Luke, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be for getting rid o\xe2\x80\x99 Ben, and making you\r\ndo with a lad; and I must help a bit wi\xe2\x80\x99 the mill. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a worse\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNe\xe2\x80\x99er mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke, \xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t plague mysen. I\xe2\x80\x99n been wi\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\ntwenty year, an\xe2\x80\x99 you can\xe2\x80\x99t get twenty year wi\xe2\x80\x99 whistlin\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x99em, no\r\nmore nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty\r\nsends \xe2\x80\x99em. I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide new victual nor new faces, _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nniver know but what they\xe2\x80\x99ll gripe you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened\r\nhimself of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources\r\nquite barren, and Mr Tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into\r\na painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him. Maggie\r\nnoticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea; and afterward\r\nhe sat leaning forward in his chair, looking at the ground, moving his\r\nlips, and shaking his head from time to time. Then he looked hard at\r\nMrs Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him, then at Maggie, who, as\r\nshe bent over her sewing, was intensely conscious of some drama going\r\nforward in her father\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Suddenly he took up the poker and broke\r\nthe large coal fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart, Mr Tulliver, what can you be thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife,\r\nlooking up in alarm; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very wasteful, breaking the coal, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot hardly any large coal left, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the rest is to\r\ncome from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re quite so well to-night, are you, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMaggie; \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how is it Tom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart! is it time? I must go and get his supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver, laying down her knitting, and leaving the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nigh upon half-past eight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be here\r\nsoon. Go, go and get the big Bible, and open it at the beginning, where\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s set down. And get the pen and ink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie obeyed, wondering; but her father gave no further orders, and\r\nonly sat listening for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s footfall on the gravel, apparently\r\nirritated by the wind, which had risen, and was roaring so as to drown\r\nall other sounds. There was a strange light in his eyes that rather\r\nfrightened Maggie; _she_ began to wish that Tom would come, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, in an excited way, when the\r\nknock came at last. Maggie went to open the door, but her mother came\r\nout of the kitchen hurriedly, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, Maggie; I\xe2\x80\x99ll open\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy, but she\r\nwas jealous of every office others did for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour supper\xe2\x80\x99s ready by the kitchen-fire, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he took\r\noff his hat and coat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it by yourself, just as you like,\r\nand I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think my father wants Tom, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9che must come into\r\nthe parlour first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom entered with his usual saddened evening face, but his eyes fell\r\nimmediately on the open Bible and the inkstand, and he glanced with a\r\nlook of anxious surprise at his father, who was saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, you\xe2\x80\x99re late; I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything the matter, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sit down, all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Tom, sit down here; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something for you to write i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nBible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all three sat down, looking at him. He began to speak slowly,\r\nlooking first at his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind, Bessy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as good as my word to you.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be the same grave made for us to lie down in, and we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe bearing one another ill-will. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop in the old place, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nserve under Wakem, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve him like an honest man; there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nTulliver but what\xe2\x80\x99s honest, mind that, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here his voice\r\nrose,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll have it to throw up against me as I paid a dividend, but\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault; it was because there\xe2\x80\x99s raskills in the world.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been too many for me, and I must give in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put my neck in\r\nharness,\xe2\x80\x94for you\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to say as I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you into trouble,\r\nBessy,\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve him as honest as if he was no raskill; I\xe2\x80\x99m an\r\nhonest man, though I shall never hold my head up no more. I\xe2\x80\x99m a tree as\r\nis broke\xe2\x80\x94a tree as is broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his head, he\r\nsaid, in a louder yet deeper tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive him! I know what they say, he never meant me any\r\nharm. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way Old Harry props up the rascals. He\xe2\x80\x99s been at the\r\nbottom of everything; but he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine gentleman,\xe2\x80\x94I know, I know. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone to law, they say. But who made it so as there was no\r\narbitratin\xe2\x80\x99, and no justice to be got? It signifies nothing to him, I\r\nknow that; he\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 them fine gentlemen as get money by doing\r\nbusiness for poorer folks, and when he\xe2\x80\x99s made beggars of \xe2\x80\x99em he\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em charity. I won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive him! I wish he might be punished with\r\nshame till his own son \xe2\x80\x99ud like to forget him. I wish he may do summat\r\nas they\xe2\x80\x99d make him work at the treadmill! But he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s too big a\r\nraskill to let the law lay hold on him. And you mind this, Tom,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nnever forgive him neither, if you mean to be my son. There\xe2\x80\x99ll maybe\r\ncome a time when you may make him feel; it\xe2\x80\x99ll never come to me; I\xe2\x80\x99n got\r\nmy head under the yoke. Now write\xe2\x80\x94write it i\xe2\x80\x99 the Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, sinking down by his knee, pale and\r\ntrembling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wicked to curse and bear malice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t wicked, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wicked\r\nas the raskills should prosper; it\xe2\x80\x99s the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Do as I tell\r\nyou, Tom. Write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to write?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with gloomy submission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite as your father, Edward Tulliver, took service under John Wakem,\r\nthe man as had helped to ruin him, because I\xe2\x80\x99d promised my wife to make\r\nher what amends I could for her trouble, and because I wanted to die in\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 old place where I was born and my father was born. Put that i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nright words\xe2\x80\x94you know how\xe2\x80\x94and then write, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Wakem for\r\nall that; and for all I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve him honest, I wish evil may befall\r\nhim. Write that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence as Tom\xe2\x80\x99s pen moved along the paper; Mrs\r\nTulliver looked scared, and Maggie trembled like a leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me hear what you\xe2\x80\x99ve wrote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, Tom read aloud\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow write\xe2\x80\x94write as you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember what Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s done to your father,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll make him and his feel it, if ever the day comes. And sign\r\nyour name Thomas Tulliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, father, dear father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, almost choked with fear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make Tom write that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_ write it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOURTH\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nA Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet\r\n\r\nJourneying down the Rhone on a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day, you have perhaps felt the\r\nsunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in\r\ncertain parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose,\r\nlike an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations\r\nwhose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a\r\ndesolation. Strange contrast, you may have thought, between the effect\r\nproduced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses, which in\r\ntheir best days were but the sign of a sordid life, belonging in all\r\nits details to our own vulgar era, and the effect produced by those\r\nruins on the castled Rhine, which have crumbled and mellowed into such\r\nharmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a\r\nnatural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in the day when they\r\nwere built they must have had this fitness, as if they had been raised\r\nby an earth-born race, who had inherited from their mighty parent a\r\nsublime instinct of form. And that was a day of romance; If those\r\nrobber-barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres, they had a certain\r\ngrandeur of the wild beast in them,\xe2\x80\x94they were forest boars with tusks,\r\ntearing and rending, not the ordinary domestic grunter; they\r\nrepresented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty, virtue,\r\nand the gentle uses of life; they made a fine contrast in the picture\r\nwith the wandering minstrel, the soft-lipped princess, the pious\r\nrecluse, and the timid Israelite. That was a time of colour, when the\r\nsunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners; a time of\r\nadventure and fierce struggle,\xe2\x80\x94nay, of living, religious art and\r\nreligious enthusiasm; for were not cathedrals built in those days, and\r\ndid not great emperors leave their Western palaces to die before the\r\ninfidel strongholds in the sacred East? Therefore it is that these\r\nRhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry; they belong to the\r\ngrand historic life of humanity, and raise up for me the vision of an\r\necho. But these dead-tinted, hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages\r\non the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life\xe2\x80\x94very much of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94is a narrow, ugly, grovelling existence, which even calamity does\r\nnot elevate, but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of\r\nconception; and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins\r\nare the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that\r\nwill be swept into the same oblivion with the generations of ants and\r\nbeavers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon\r\nyou in watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of the\r\nFloss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the\r\ntragi-comic. It is a sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and\r\nDodsons, irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no\r\nactive, self-renouncing faith; moved by none of those wild,\r\nuncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of misery and\r\ncrime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants, that hard,\r\nsubmissive, ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of what nature\r\nhas written, which gives its poetry to peasant life. Here one has\r\nconventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without\r\npolish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud\r\nrespectability in a gig of unfashionable build; worldliness without\r\nside-dishes. Observing these people narrowly, even when the iron hand\r\nof misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the\r\nworld, one sees little trace of religion, still less of a distinctively\r\nChristian creed. Their belief in the Unseen, so far as it manifests\r\nitself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their moral notions,\r\nthough held with strong tenacity, seem to have no standard beyond\r\nhereditary custom. You could not live among such people; you are\r\nstifled for want of an outlet toward something beautiful, great, or\r\nnoble; you are irritated with these dull men and women, as a kind of\r\npopulation out of keeping with the earth on which they live,\xe2\x80\x94with this\r\nrich plain where the great river flows forever onward, and links the\r\nsmall pulse of the old English town with the beatings of the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that lashes its gods or lashes\r\nits own back, seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human\r\nlot, than the mental condition of these emmet-like Dodsons and\r\nTullivers.\r\n\r\nI share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is\r\nnecessary that we should feel it, if we care to understand how it acted\r\non the lives of Tom and Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94how it has acted on young natures in\r\nmany generations, that in the onward tendency of human things have\r\nrisen above the mental level of the generation before them, to which\r\nthey have been nevertheless tied by the strongest fibres of their\r\nhearts. The suffering, whether of martyr or victim, which belongs to\r\nevery historical advance of mankind, is represented in this way in\r\nevery town, and by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we need not shrink\r\nfrom this comparison of small things with great; for does not science\r\ntell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity\r\nwhich shall bind the smallest things with the greatest? In natural\r\nscience, I have understood, there is nothing petty to the mind that has\r\na large vision of relations, and to which every single object suggests\r\na vast sum of conditions. It is surely the same with the observation of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nCertainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers\r\nwere of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the\r\nstatement that they were part of the Protestant population of Great\r\nBritain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all\r\ntheories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been\r\nreared and have flourished; but it had the very slightest tincture of\r\ntheology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters, their Bibles\r\nopened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried\r\ntulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without\r\npreference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their religion\r\nwas of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nheresy properly means choice,\xe2\x80\x94for they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was any other\r\nreligion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in\r\nfamilies, like asthma. How _should_ they know? The vicar of their\r\npleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at\r\nwhist, and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female\r\nparishioner. The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering whatever\r\nwas customary and respectable; it was necessary to be baptised, else\r\none could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take the sacrament\r\nbefore death, as a security against more dimly understood perils; but\r\nit was of equal necessity to have the proper pall-bearers and\r\nwell-cured hams at one\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable will. A\r\nDodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was\r\nbecoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was\r\nplainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners,\r\nand in the family traditions,\xe2\x80\x94such as obedience to parents,\r\nfaithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough\r\nscouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to\r\ndisappear from the currency, the production of first-rate commodities\r\nfor the market, and the general preference of whatever was home-made.\r\nThe Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter\r\nfrustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty\r\nor propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects, since it identified\r\nhonour with perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness\r\nto admitted rules; and society owes some worthy qualities in many of\r\nher members to mothers of the Dodson class, who made their butter and\r\ntheir fromenty well, and would have felt disgraced to make it\r\notherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less\r\nto seem rich though being poor; rather, the family badge was to be\r\nhonest and rich, and not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To\r\nlive respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an\r\nachievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified\r\nif, on the reading of your will, you sank in the opinion of your\r\nfellow-men, either by turning out to be poorer than they expected, or\r\nby leaving your money in a capricious manner, without strict regard to\r\ndegrees of kin. The right thing must always be done toward kindred. The\r\nright thing was to correct them severely, if they were other than a\r\ncredit to the family, but still not to alienate from them the smallest\r\nrightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property. A\r\nconspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its\r\nvices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had\r\na hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest,\r\nand would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient \xe2\x80\x9ckin,\xe2\x80\x9d but would\r\nnever forsake or ignore them,\xe2\x80\x94would not let them want bread, but only\r\nrequire them to eat it with bitter herbs.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins, but it\r\nwas carried in richer blood, having elements of generous imprudence,\r\nwarm affection, and hot-tempered rashness. Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather\r\nhad been heard to say that he was descended from one Ralph Tulliver, a\r\nwonderfully clever fellow, who had ruined himself. It is likely enough\r\nthat the clever Ralph was a high liver, rode spirited horses, and was\r\nvery decidedly of his own opinion. On the other hand, nobody had ever\r\nheard of a Dodson who had ruined himself; it was not the way of that\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIf such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had\r\nbeen reared in the praiseworthy past of Pitt and high prices, you will\r\ninfer from what you already know concerning the state of society in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them\r\nin their maturer life. It was still possible, even in that later time\r\nof anti-Catholic preaching, for people to hold many pagan ideas, and\r\nbelieve themselves good church-people, notwithstanding; so we need\r\nhardly feel any surprise at the fact that Mr Tulliver, though a regular\r\nchurch-goer, recorded his vindictiveness on the fly-leaf of his Bible.\r\nIt was not that any harm could be said concerning the vicar of that\r\ncharming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged; he was a man of\r\nexcellent family, an irreproachable bachelor, of elegant pursuits,\xe2\x80\x94had\r\ntaken honours, and held a fellowship. Mr Tulliver regarded him with\r\ndutiful respect, as he did everything else belonging to the\r\nchurch-service; but he considered that church was one thing and\r\ncommon-sense another, and he wanted nobody to tell _him_ what\r\ncommonsense was. Certain seeds which are required to find a nidus for\r\nthemselves under unfavourable circumstances have been supplied by\r\nnature with an apparatus of hooks, so that they will get a hold on very\r\nunreceptive surfaces. The spiritual seed which had been scattered over\r\nMr Tulliver had apparently been destitute of any corresponding\r\nprovision, and had slipped off to the winds again, from a total absence\r\nof hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nThe Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns\r\n\r\nThere is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies\r\nthe first shocks of trouble, just as an acute pain is often a stimulus,\r\nand produces an excitement which is transient strength. It is in the\r\nslow, changed life that follows; in the time when sorrow has become\r\nstale, and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its\r\npain; in the time when day follows day in dull, unexpectant sameness,\r\nand trial is a dreary routine,\xe2\x80\x94it is then that despair threatens; it is\r\nthen that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt, and eye and ear\r\nare strained after some unlearned secret of our existence, which shall\r\ngive to endurance the nature of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis time of utmost need was come to Maggie, with her short span of\r\nthirteen years. To the usual precocity of the girl, she added that\r\nearly experience of struggle, of conflict between the inward impulse\r\nand outward fact, which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate\r\nnature; and the years since she hammered the nails into her wooden\r\nFetish among the worm-eaten shelves of the attic had been filled with\r\nso eager a life in the triple world of Reality, Books, and Waking\r\nDreams, that Maggie was strangely old for her years in everything\r\nexcept in her entire want of that prudence and self-command which were\r\nthe qualities that made Tom manly in the midst of his intellectual\r\nboyishness. And now her lot was beginning to have a still, sad\r\nmonotony, which threw her more than ever on her inward self. Her father\r\nwas able to attend to business again, his affairs were settled, and he\r\nwas acting as Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s manager on the old spot. Tom went to and fro\r\nevery morning and evening, and became more and more silent in the short\r\nintervals at home; what was there to say? One day was like another; and\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s interest in life, driven back and crushed on every other side,\r\nwas concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious resistance\r\nto misfortune. The peculiarities of his father and mother were very\r\nirksome to him, now they were laid bare of all the softening\r\naccompaniments of an easy, prosperous home; for Tom had very clear,\r\nprosaic eyes, not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination.\r\nPoor Mrs Tulliver, it seemed, would never recover her old self, her\r\nplacid household activity; how could she? The objects among which her\r\nmind had moved complacently were all gone,\xe2\x80\x94all the little hopes and\r\nschemes and speculations, all the pleasant little cares about her\r\ntreasures which had made the world quite comprehensible to her for a\r\nquarter of a century, since she had made her first purchase of the\r\nsugar-tongs, had been suddenly snatched away from her, and she remained\r\nbewildered in this empty life. Why that should have happened to her\r\nwhich had not happened to other women remained an insoluble question by\r\nwhich she expressed her perpetual ruminating comparison of the past\r\nwith the present. It was piteous to see the comely woman getting\r\nthinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness,\r\nwhich made her often wander about the empty house after her work was\r\ndone, until Maggie, becoming alarmed about her, would seek her, and\r\nbring her down by telling her how it vexed Tom that she was injuring\r\nher health by never sitting down and resting herself. Yet amidst this\r\nhelpless imbecility there was a touching trait of humble, self-devoting\r\nmaternity, which made Maggie feel tenderly toward her poor mother\r\namidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental feebleness.\r\nShe would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most\r\nsoiling to the hands, and was quite peevish when Maggie attempted to\r\nrelieve her from her grate-brushing and scouring: \xe2\x80\x9cLet it alone, my\r\ndear; your hands \xe2\x80\x99ull get as hard as hard,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s place to do that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do the sewing\xe2\x80\x94my eyes fail me.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe would still brush and carefully tend Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s hair, which she had\r\nbecome reconciled to, in spite of its refusal to curl, now it was so\r\nlong and massy. Maggie was not her pet child, and, in general, would\r\nhave been much better if she had been quite different; yet the womanly\r\nheart, so bruised in its small personal desires, found a future to rest\r\non in the life of this young thing, and the mother pleased herself with\r\nwearing out her own hands to save the hands that had so much more life\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nBut the constant presence of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s regretful bewilderment was\r\nless painful to Maggie than that of her father\xe2\x80\x99s sullen,\r\nincommunicative depression. As long as the paralysis was upon him, and\r\nit seemed as if he might always be in a childlike condition of\r\ndependence,\xe2\x80\x94as long as he was still only half awakened to his\r\ntrouble,\xe2\x80\x94Maggie had felt the strong tide of pitying love almost as an\r\ninspiration, a new power, that would make the most difficult life easy\r\nfor his sake; but now, instead of childlike dependence, there had come\r\na taciturn, hard concentration of purpose, in strange contrast with his\r\nold vehement communicativeness and high spirit; and this lasted from\r\nday to day, and from week to week, the dull eye never brightening with\r\nany eagerness or any joy. It is something cruelly incomprehensible to\r\nyouthful natures, this sombre sameness in middle-aged and elderly\r\npeople, whose life has resulted in disappointment and discontent, to\r\nwhose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about the\r\nlips and brow seem to take no notice of it, and it hurries away again\r\nfor want of a welcome. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy will they not kindle up and be glad\r\nsometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d thinks young elasticity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be so easy if they only\r\nliked to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d And these leaden clouds that never part are apt to\r\ncreate impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in\r\nnothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious affliction.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home; he hurried away from\r\nmarket, he refused all invitations to stay and chat, as in old times,\r\nin the houses where he called on business. He could not be reconciled\r\nwith his lot. There was no attitude in which his pride did not feel its\r\nbruises; and in all behaviour toward him, whether kind or cold, he\r\ndetected an allusion to the change in his circumstances. Even the days\r\non which Wakem came to ride round the land and inquire into the\r\nbusiness were not so black to him as those market-days on which he had\r\nmet several creditors who had accepted a composition from him. To save\r\nsomething toward the repayment of those creditors was the object toward\r\nwhich he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts; and under the\r\ninfluence of this all-compelling demand of his nature, the somewhat\r\nprofuse man, who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his\r\nown house, was gradually metamorphosed into the keen-eyed grudger of\r\nmorsels. Mrs Tulliver could not economise enough to satisfy him, in\r\ntheir food and firing; and he would eat nothing himself but what was of\r\nthe coarsest quality. Tom, though depressed and strongly repelled by\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s sullenness, and the dreariness of home, entered thoroughly\r\ninto his father\xe2\x80\x99s feelings about paying the creditors; and the poor lad\r\nbrought his first quarter\xe2\x80\x99s money, with a delicious sense of\r\nachievement, and gave it to his father to put into the tin box which\r\nheld the savings. The little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed\r\nto be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\xe2\x80\x94faint and transient, for it was soon dispelled by the\r\nthought that the time would be long\xe2\x80\x94perhaps longer than his\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x94before the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of\r\ndebt. A deficit of more than five hundred pounds, with the accumulating\r\ninterest, seemed a deep pit to fill with the savings from thirty\r\nshillings a-week, even when Tom\xe2\x80\x99s probable savings were to be added. On\r\nthis one point there was entire community of feeling in the four widely\r\ndiffering beings who sat round the dying fire of sticks, which made a\r\ncheap warmth for them on the verge of bedtime. Mrs Tulliver carried the\r\nproud integrity of the Dodsons in her blood, and had been brought up to\r\nthink that to wrong people of their money, which was another phrase for\r\ndebt, was a sort of moral pillory; it would have been wickedness, to\r\nher mind, to have run counter to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s desire to \xe2\x80\x9cdo the right\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x9d and retrieve his name. She had a confused, dreamy notion that,\r\nif the creditors were all paid, her plate and linen ought to come back\r\nto her; but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money\r\nthey were unable to pay, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rightly call anything their own.\r\nShe murmured a little that Mr Tulliver so peremptorily refused to\r\nreceive anything in repayment from Mr and Mrs Moss; but to all his\r\nrequirements of household economy she was submissive to the point of\r\ndenying herself the cheapest indulgences of mere flavour; her only\r\nrebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen something that would make\r\nrather a better supper than usual for Tom.\r\n\r\nThese narrow notions about debt, held by the old fashioned Tullivers,\r\nmay perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days\r\nof wide commercial views and wide philosophy, according to which\r\neverything rights itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my\r\ntradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene\r\ncertainty that somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s tradesman is in pocket by somebody else;\r\nand since there must be bad debts in the world, why, it is mere egoism\r\nnot to like that we in particular should make them instead of our\r\nfellow-citizens. I am telling the history of very simple people, who\r\nhad never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nUnder all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire,\r\nMr Tulliver retained the feeling toward his \xe2\x80\x9clittle wench\xe2\x80\x9d which made\r\nher presence a need to him, though it would not suffice to cheer him.\r\nShe was still the desire of his eyes; but the sweet spring of fatherly\r\nlove was now mingled with bitterness, like everything else. When Maggie\r\nlaid down her work at night, it was her habit to get a low stool and\r\nsit by her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, leaning her cheek against it. How she wished\r\nhe would stroke her head, or give some sign that he was soothed by the\r\nsense that he had a daughter who loved him! But now she got no answer\r\nto her little caresses, either from her father or from Tom,\xe2\x80\x94the two\r\nidols of her life. Tom was weary and abstracted in the short intervals\r\nwhen he was at home, and her father was bitterly preoccupied with the\r\nthought that the girl was growing up, was shooting up into a woman; and\r\nhow was she to do well in life? She had a poor chance for marrying,\r\ndown in the world as they were. And he hated the thought of her\r\nmarrying poorly, as her aunt Gritty had done; _that_ would be a thing\r\nto make him turn in his grave,\xe2\x80\x94the little wench so pulled down by\r\nchildren and toil, as her aunt Moss was. When uncultured minds,\r\nconfined to a narrow range of personal experience, are under the\r\npressure of continued misfortune, their inward life is apt to become a\r\nperpetually repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts; the same words,\r\nthe same scenes, are revolved over and over again, the same mood\r\naccompanies them; the end of the year finds them as much what they were\r\nat the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe sameness of the days was broken by few visitors. Uncles and aunts\r\npaid only short visits now; of course, they could not stay to meals,\r\nand the constraint caused by Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s savage silence, which seemed\r\nto add to the hollow resonance of the bare, uncarpeted room when the\r\naunts were talking, heightened the unpleasantness of these family\r\nvisits on all sides, and tended to make them rare. As for other\r\nacquaintances, there is a chill air surrounding those who are down in\r\nthe world, and people are glad to get away from them, as from a cold\r\nroom; human beings, mere men and women, without furniture, without\r\nanything to offer you, who have ceased to count as anybody, present an\r\nembarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them, or of\r\nsubjects on which to converse with them. At that distant day, there was\r\na dreary isolation in the civilised Christian society of these realms\r\nfor families that had dropped below their original level, unless they\r\nbelonged to a sectarian church, which gets some warmth of brotherhood\r\nby walling in the sacred fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nA Voice from the Past\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when the chestnuts were coming into flower, Maggie had\r\nbrought her chair outside the front door, and was seated there with a\r\nbook on her knees. Her dark eyes had wandered from the book, but they\r\ndid not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of\r\njasmine on the projecting porch at her right, and threw leafy shadows\r\non her pale round cheek; they seemed rather to be searching for\r\nsomething that was not disclosed by the sunshine. It had been a more\r\nmiserable day than usual; her father, after a visit of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s had had\r\na paroxysm of rage, in which for some trifling fault he had beaten the\r\nboy who served in the mill. Once before, since his illness, he had had\r\na similar paroxysm, in which he had beaten his horse, and the scene had\r\nleft a lasting terror in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s mind. The thought had risen, that\r\nsome time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to speak in\r\nher feeble way at the wrong moment. The keenest of all dread with her\r\nwas lest her father should add to his present misfortune the\r\nwretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful. The battered\r\nschool-book of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s which she held on her knees could give her no\r\nfortitude under the pressure of that dread; and again and again her\r\neyes had filled with tears, as they wandered vaguely, seeing neither\r\nthe chestnut-trees, nor the distant horizon, but only future scenes of\r\nhome-sorrow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of\r\nfootsteps on the gravel. It was not Tom who was entering, but a man in\r\na sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat, carrying a pack on his back,\r\nand followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bob, it\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, starting up with a smile of pleased\r\nrecognition, for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the\r\nrecollection of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s generosity; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, lifting his cap and showing a delighted\r\nface, but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying\r\nembarrassment by looking down at his dog, and saying in a tone of\r\ndisgust, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, you thunderin\xe2\x80\x99 sawney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is not at home yet, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9che is always at St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s in the daytime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad to see Mr Tom, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njust what I\xe2\x80\x99m come for,\xe2\x80\x94look here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob was in the act of depositing his pack on the door-step, and with it\r\na row of small books fastened together with string.\r\n\r\nApparently, however, they were not the object to which he wished to\r\ncall Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s attention, but rather something which he had carried\r\nunder his arm, wrapped in a red handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, laying the red parcel on the others and\r\nunfolding it; \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m a-makin\xe2\x80\x99 too free, Miss, I hope, but\r\nI lighted on these books, and I thought they might make up to you a bit\r\nfor them as you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost; for I heared you speak o\xe2\x80\x99 picturs,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 as for\r\npicturs, _look_ here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeepsake\xe2\x80\x9d and six or seven numbers of a \xe2\x80\x9cPortrait Gallery,\xe2\x80\x9d in royal\r\noctavo; and the emphatic request to look referred to a portrait of\r\nGeorge the Fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and\r\nvoluminous neckcloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 genelmen here,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob went on, turning over the\r\nleaves with some excitement, \xe2\x80\x9cwi\xe2\x80\x99 all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 noses,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 some bald an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsome wi\xe2\x80\x99 wigs,\xe2\x80\x94Parlament genelmen, I reckon. An\xe2\x80\x99 here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nopening the \xe2\x80\x9cKeepsake,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_here\xe2\x80\x99s_ ladies for you, some wi\xe2\x80\x99 curly hair\r\nand some wi\xe2\x80\x99 smooth, an\xe2\x80\x99 some a-smiling wi\xe2\x80\x99 their heads o\xe2\x80\x99 one side,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 some as if they were goin\xe2\x80\x99 to cry,\xe2\x80\x94look here,\xe2\x80\x94a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 on the\r\nground out o\xe2\x80\x99 door, dressed like the ladies I\xe2\x80\x99n seen get out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ncarriages at the balls in th\xe2\x80\x99 Old Hall there. My eyes! I wonder what\r\nthe chaps wear as go a-courtin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em! I sot up till the clock was gone\r\ntwelve last night, a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94I did,\xe2\x80\x94till they stared at me out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the picturs as if they\xe2\x80\x99d know when I spoke to \xe2\x80\x99em. But, lors! I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say to \xe2\x80\x99em. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be more fittin\xe2\x80\x99 company for\r\nyou, Miss; and the man at the book-stall, he said they banged\r\niverything for picturs; he said they was a fust-rate article.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve bought them for me, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, deeply touched by\r\nthis simple kindness. \xe2\x80\x9cHow very, very good of you! But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\r\ngave a great deal of money for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 gev three times the money if they\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nup to you a bit for them as was sold away from you, Miss. For I\xe2\x80\x99n niver\r\nforgot how you looked when you fretted about the books bein\xe2\x80\x99 gone; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin\xe2\x80\x99 before me. An\xe2\x80\x99 when I see\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthe book open upo\xe2\x80\x99 the stall, wi\xe2\x80\x99 the lady lookin\xe2\x80\x99 out of it wi\xe2\x80\x99 eyes a\r\nbit like your\xe2\x80\x99n when you was frettin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my takin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nliberty, Miss,\xe2\x80\x94I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d make free to buy it for you, an\xe2\x80\x99 then I\r\nbought the books full o\xe2\x80\x99 genelmen to match; an\xe2\x80\x99 then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Bob took up\r\nthe small stringed packet of books\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might like a bit more\r\nprint as well as the picturs, an\xe2\x80\x99 I got these for a sayso,\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncram-full o\xe2\x80\x99 print, an\xe2\x80\x99 I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d do no harm comin\xe2\x80\x99 along wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthese bettermost books. An\xe2\x80\x99 I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t say me nay, an\xe2\x80\x99 tell me as\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x99em, like Mr Tom did wi\xe2\x80\x99 the suvreigns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very thankful to you for thinking\r\nof me, and being so good to me and Tom. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one ever did\r\nsuch a kind thing for me before. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t many friends who care for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHev a dog, Miss!\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re better friends nor any Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob,\r\nlaying down his pack again, which he had taken up with the intention of\r\nhurrying away; for he felt considerable shyness in talking to a young\r\nlass like Maggie, though, as he usually said of himself, \xe2\x80\x9chis tongue\r\noverrun him\xe2\x80\x9d when he began to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give you Mumps, \xe2\x80\x99cause\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d break his heart to go away from me\xe2\x80\x94eh, Mumps, what do you say, you\r\nriff-raff?\xe2\x80\x9d (Mumps declined to express himself more diffusely than by a\r\nsingle affirmative movement of his tail.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d get you a pup, Miss,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, Bob. We have a yard dog, and I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a dog of my\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pity; else there\xe2\x80\x99s a pup,\xe2\x80\x94if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind about it not\r\nbeing thoroughbred; its mother acts in the Punch show,\xe2\x80\x94an uncommon\r\nsensible bitch; she means more sense wi\xe2\x80\x99 her bark nor half the chaps\r\ncan put into their talk from breakfast to sundown. There\xe2\x80\x99s one chap\r\ncarries pots,\xe2\x80\x94a poor, low trade as any on the road,\xe2\x80\x94he says, \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\nToby\xe2\x80\x99s nought but a mongrel; there\xe2\x80\x99s nought to look at in her.\xe2\x80\x99 But I\r\nsays to him, \xe2\x80\x98Why, what are you yoursen but a mongrel? There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch pickin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 _your_ feyther an\xe2\x80\x99 mother, to look at you.\xe2\x80\x99 Not but I\r\nlike a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 breed myself, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide to see one cur grinnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat another. I wish you good evenin\xe2\x80\x99, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, abruptly taking\r\nup his pack again, under the consciousness that his tongue was acting\r\nin an undisciplined manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in the evening some time, and see my brother, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss, thank you\xe2\x80\x94another time. You\xe2\x80\x99ll give my duty to him, if you\r\nplease. Eh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine growed chap, Mr Tom is; he took to growin\xe2\x80\x99 i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe legs, an\xe2\x80\x99 _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pack was down again, now, the hook of the stick having somehow gone\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t call Mumps a cur, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, divining that any\r\ninterest she showed in Mumps would be gratifying to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss, a fine way off that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, with pitying smile; \xe2\x80\x9cMumps\r\nis as fine a cross as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see anywhere along the Floss, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99n been\r\nup it wi\xe2\x80\x99 the barge times enow. Why, the gentry stops to look at him;\r\nbut you won\xe2\x80\x99t catch Mumps a-looking at the gentry much,\xe2\x80\x94he minds his\r\nown business, he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression of Mump\xe2\x80\x99s face, which seemed to be tolerating the\r\nsuperfluous existence of objects in general, was strongly confirmatory\r\nof this high praise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks dreadfully surly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cWould he let me pat him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that would he, and thank you. He knows his company, Mumps does. He\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a dog as \xe2\x80\x99ull be caught wi\xe2\x80\x99 gingerbread; he\xe2\x80\x99d smell a thief a\r\ngood deal stronger nor the gingerbread, he would. Lors, I talk to him\r\nby th\xe2\x80\x99 hour together, when I\xe2\x80\x99m walking i\xe2\x80\x99 lone places, and if I\xe2\x80\x99n done\r\na bit o\xe2\x80\x99 mischief, I allays tell him. I\xe2\x80\x99n got no secrets but what Mumps\r\nknows \xe2\x80\x99em. He knows about my big thumb, he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour big thumb\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a singularly\r\nbroad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ntells i\xe2\x80\x99 measuring out the flannel, you see. I carry flannel, \xe2\x80\x99cause\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s light for my pack, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s dear stuff, you see, so a big thumb\r\ntells. I clap my thumb at the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the yard and cut o\xe2\x80\x99 the hither\r\nside of it, and the old women aren\xe2\x80\x99t up to\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking serious, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s cheating; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto hear you say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I said it. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so used to talking to Mumps, an\xe2\x80\x99 he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 cheating,\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s them skinflint women, as haggle an\xe2\x80\x99 haggle, an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ud like to\r\nget their flannel for nothing, an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ud niver ask theirselves how I got\r\nmy dinner out on\xe2\x80\x99t. I niver cheat anybody as doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to cheat me,\r\nMiss,\xe2\x80\x94lors, I\xe2\x80\x99m a honest chap, I am; only I must hev a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 sport,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 now I don\xe2\x80\x99t go wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 ferrets, I\xe2\x80\x99n got no varmint to come over but\r\nthem haggling women. I wish you good evening, Miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Bob. Thank you very much for bringing me the books. And come\r\nagain to see Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, moving on a few steps; then turning half round\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave off that trick wi\xe2\x80\x99 my big thumb, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink well on me for it, Miss; but it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a pity, it would. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find another trick so good,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 what \xe2\x80\x99ud be the use o\xe2\x80\x99 havin\xe2\x80\x99\r\na big thumb? It might as well ha\xe2\x80\x99 been narrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, thus exalted into Bob\xe2\x80\x99s exalting Madonna, laughed in spite of\r\nherself; at which her worshipper\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes twinkled too, and under\r\nthese favouring auspices he touched his cap and walked away.\r\n\r\nThe days of chivalry are not gone, notwithstanding Burke\xe2\x80\x99s grand dirge\r\nover them; they live still in that far-off worship paid by many a youth\r\nand man to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so\r\nmuch as her little finger or the hem of her robe. Bob, with the pack on\r\nhis back, had as respectful an adoration for this dark-eyed maiden as\r\nif he had been a knight in armor calling aloud on her name as he\r\npricked on to the fight.\r\n\r\nThat gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, and perhaps\r\nonly made the returning gloom deeper by contrast. She was too\r\ndispirited even to like answering questions about Bob\xe2\x80\x99s present of\r\nbooks, and she carried them away to her bedroom, laying them down there\r\nand seating herself on her one stool, without caring to look at them\r\njust yet. She leaned her cheek against the window-frame, and thought\r\nthat the light-hearted Bob had a lot much happier than hers.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s sense of loneliness, and utter privation of joy, had deepened\r\nwith the brightness of advancing spring. All the favourite outdoor\r\nnooks about home, which seemed to have done their part with her parents\r\nin nurturing and cherishing her, were now mixed up with the\r\nhome-sadness, and gathered no smile from the sunshine. Every affection,\r\nevery delight the poor child had had, was like an aching nerve to her.\r\nThere was no music for her any more,\xe2\x80\x94no piano, no harmonised voices, no\r\ndelicious stringed instruments, with their passionate cries of\r\nimprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration through her frame. And\r\nof all her school-life there was nothing left her now but her little\r\ncollection of school-books, which she turned over with a sickening\r\nsense that she knew them all, and they were all barren of comfort. Even\r\nat school she had often wished for books with _more_ in them;\r\neverything she learned there seemed like the ends of long threads that\r\nsnapped immediately. And now\xe2\x80\x94without the indirect charm of\r\nschool-emulation\xe2\x80\x94T\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9maque was mere bran; so were the hard, dry\r\nquestions on Christian Doctrine; there was no flavour in them, no\r\nstrength. Sometimes Maggie thought she could have been contented with\r\nabsorbing fancies; if she could have had all Scott\xe2\x80\x99s novels and all\r\nByron\xe2\x80\x99s poems!\xe2\x80\x94then, perhaps, she might have found happiness enough to\r\ndull her sensibility to her actual daily life. And yet they were hardly\r\nwhat she wanted. She could make dream-worlds of her own, but no\r\ndream-world would satisfy her now. She wanted some explanation of this\r\nhard, real life,\xe2\x80\x94the unhappy-looking father, seated at the dull\r\nbreakfast-table; the childish, bewildered mother; the little sordid\r\ntasks that filled the hours, or the more oppressive emptiness of weary,\r\njoyless leisure; the need of some tender, demonstrative love; the cruel\r\nsense that Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind what she thought or felt, and that they were\r\nno longer playfellows together; the privation of all pleasant things\r\nthat had come to _her_ more than to others,\xe2\x80\x94she wanted some key that\r\nwould enable her to understand, and in understanding, to endure, the\r\nheavy weight that had fallen on her young heart. If she had been taught\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creal learning and wisdom, such as great men knew,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought she\r\nshould have held the secrets of life; if she had only books, that she\r\nmight learn for herself what wise men knew! Saints and martyrs had\r\nnever interested Maggie so much as sages and poets. She knew little of\r\nsaints and martyrs, and had gathered, as a general result of her\r\nteaching, that they were a temporary provision against the spread of\r\nCatholicism, and had all died at Smithfield.\r\n\r\nIn one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s school-books, which had been sent home in his trunk. But she\r\nfound the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had\r\nbeen well thumbed,\xe2\x80\x94the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus, a torn\r\nEutropius, the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich\xe2\x80\x99s Logic, and the exasperating\r\nEuclid. Still, Latin, Euclid, and Logic would surely be a considerable\r\nstep in masculine wisdom,\xe2\x80\x94in that knowledge which made men contented,\r\nand even glad to live. Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was\r\nquite unmixed; a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert\r\nof the future, in which she seemed to see herself honoured for her\r\nsurprising attainments. And so the poor child, with her soul\xe2\x80\x99s hunger\r\nand her illusions of self-flattery, began to nibble at this\r\nthick-rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling her vacant hours\r\nwith Latin, geometry, and the forms of the syllogism, and feeling a\r\ngleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal to\r\nthese peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two she went on\r\nresolutely enough, though with an occasional sinking of heart, as if\r\nshe had set out toward the Promised Land alone, and found it a thirsty,\r\ntrackless, uncertain journey. In the severity of her early resolution,\r\nshe would take Aldrich out into the fields, and then look off her book\r\ntoward the sky, where the lark was twinkling, or to the reeds and\r\nbushes by the river, from which the waterfowl rustled forth on its\r\nanxious, awkward flight,\xe2\x80\x94with a startled sense that the relation\r\nbetween Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for her. The\r\ndiscouragement deepened as the days went on, and the eager heart gained\r\nfaster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow, when she sat at the\r\nwindow with her book, her eyes _would_ fix themselves blankly on the\r\noutdoor sunshine; then they would fill with tears, and sometimes, if\r\nher mother was not in the room, the studies would all end in sobbing.\r\nShe rebelled against her lot, she fainted under its loneliness, and\r\nfits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother, who were so\r\nunlike what she would have them to be; toward Tom, who checked her, and\r\nmet her thought or feeling always by some thwarting difference,\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nflow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream, and\r\nfrighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a\r\ndemon. Then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from\r\nhome in search of something less sordid and dreary; she would go to\r\nsome great man\xe2\x80\x94Walter Scott, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94and tell him how wretched and how\r\nclever she was, and he would surely do something for her. But, in the\r\nmiddle of her vision, her father would perhaps enter the room for the\r\nevening, and, surprised that she sat still without noticing him, would\r\nsay complainingly, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, am I to fetch my slippers myself?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice\r\npierced through Maggie like a sword; there was another sadness besides\r\nher own, and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and\r\nforsaking it.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, the sight of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful freckled face had given her\r\ndiscontent a new direction. She thought it was part of the hardship of\r\nher life that there was laid upon her the burthen of larger wants than\r\nothers seemed to feel,\xe2\x80\x94that she had to endure this wide, hopeless\r\nyearning for that something, whatever it was, that was greatest and\r\nbest on this earth. She wished she could have been like Bob, with his\r\neasily satisfied ignorance, or like Tom, who had something to do on\r\nwhich he could fix his mind with a steady purpose, and disregard\r\neverything else. Poor child! as she leaned her head against the\r\nwindow-frame, with her hands clasped tighter and tighter, and her foot\r\nbeating the ground, she was as lonely in her trouble as if she had been\r\nthe only girl in the civilised world of that day who had come out of\r\nher school-life with a soul untrained for inevitable struggles, with no\r\nother part of her inherited share in the hard-won treasures of thought\r\nwhich generations of painful toil have laid up for the race of men,\r\nthan shreds and patches of feeble literature and false history, with\r\nmuch futile information about Saxon and other kings of doubtful\r\nexample, but unhappily quite without that knowledge of the irreversible\r\nlaws within and without her, which, governing the habits, becomes\r\nmorality, and developing the feelings of submission and dependence,\r\nbecomes religion,\xe2\x80\x94as lonely in her trouble as if every other girl\r\nbesides herself had been cherished and watched over by elder minds, not\r\nforgetful of their own early time, when need was keen and impulse\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nAt last Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the\r\nwindow-shelf, and she half forsook her reverie to turn over listlessly\r\nthe leaves of the \xe2\x80\x9cPortrait Gallery,\xe2\x80\x9d but she soon pushed this aside to\r\nexamine the little row of books tied together with string. \xe2\x80\x9cBeauties of\r\nthe Spectator,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRasselas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEconomy of Human Life,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGregory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLetters,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she knew the sort of matter that was inside all these; the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian Year,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that seemed to be a hymnbook, and she laid it down\r\nagain; but _Thomas \xc3\xa0 Kempis?_\xe2\x80\x94the name had come across her in her\r\nreading, and she felt the satisfaction, which every one knows, of\r\ngetting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary in the\r\nmemory. She took up the little, old, clumsy book with some curiosity;\r\nit had the corners turned down in many places, and some hand, now\r\nforever quiet, had made at certain passages strong pen-and-ink marks,\r\nlong since browned by time. Maggie turned from leaf to leaf, and read\r\nwhere the quiet hand pointed: \xe2\x80\x9cKnow that the love of thyself doth hurt\r\nthee more than anything in the world.... If thou seekest this or that,\r\nand wouldst be here or there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure, thou\r\nshalt never be quiet nor free from care; for in everything somewhat\r\nwill be wanting, and in every place there will be some that will cross\r\nthee.... Both above and below, which way soever thou dost turn thee,\r\neverywhere thou shalt find the Cross; and everywhere of necessity thou\r\nmust have patience, if thou wilt have inward peace, and enjoy an\r\neverlasting crown.... If thou desirest to mount unto this height, thou\r\nmust set out courageously, and lay the axe to the root, that thou\r\nmayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to\r\nthyself, and unto all private and earthly good. On this sin, that a man\r\ninordinately loveth himself, almost all dependeth, whatsoever is\r\nthoroughly to be overcome; which evil being once overcome and subdued,\r\nthere will presently ensue great peace and tranquillity.... It is but\r\nlittle thou sufferest in comparison of them that have suffered so much,\r\nwere so strongly tempted, so grievously afflicted, so many ways tried\r\nand exercised. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy\r\nsufferings of others, that thou mayest the easier bear thy little\r\nadversities. And if they seem not little unto thee, beware lest thy\r\nimpatience be the cause thereof.... Blessed are those ears that receive\r\nthe whispers of the divine voice, and listen not to the whisperings of\r\nthe world. Blessed are those ears which hearken not unto the voice\r\nwhich soundeth outwardly, but unto the Truth, which teacheth inwardly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she read, as if she\r\nhad been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music, telling of\r\nbeings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor. She went on\r\nfrom one brown mark to another, where the quiet hand seemed to point,\r\nhardly conscious that she was reading, seeming rather to listen while a\r\nlow voice said;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dost thou here gaze about, since this is not the place of thy\r\nrest? In heaven ought to be thy dwelling, and all earthly things are to\r\nbe looked on as they forward thy journey thither. All things pass away,\r\nand thou together with them. Beware thou cleavest not unto them, lest\r\nthou be entangled and perish.... If a man should give all his\r\nsubstance, yet it is as nothing. And if he should do great penances,\r\nyet are they but little. And if he should attain to all knowledge, he\r\nis yet far off. And if he should be of great virtue, and very fervent\r\ndevotion, yet is there much wanting; to wit, one thing, which is most\r\nnecessary for him. What is that? That having left all, he leave\r\nhimself, and go wholly out of himself, and retain nothing of\r\nself-love.... I have often said unto thee, and now again I say the\r\nsame, Forsake thyself, resign thyself, and thou shalt enjoy much inward\r\npeace.... Then shall all vain imaginations, evil perturbations, and\r\nsuperfluous cares fly away; then shall immoderate fear leave thee, and\r\ninordinate love shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back, as if to see\r\na sudden vision more clearly. Here, then, was a secret of life that\r\nwould enable her to renounce all other secrets; here was a sublime\r\nheight to be reached without the help of outward things; here was\r\ninsight, and strength, and conquest, to be won by means entirely within\r\nher own soul, where a supreme Teacher was waiting to be heard. It\r\nflashed through her like the suddenly apprehended solution of a\r\nproblem, that all the miseries of her young life had come from fixing\r\nher heart on her own pleasure, as if that were the central necessity of\r\nthe universe; and for the first time she saw the possibility of\r\nshifting the position from which she looked at the gratification of her\r\nown desires,\xe2\x80\x94of taking her stand out of herself, and looking at her own\r\nlife as an insignificant part of a divinely guided whole. She read on\r\nand on in the old book, devouring eagerly the dialogues with the\r\ninvisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of all strength;\r\nreturning to it after she had been called away, and reading till the\r\nsun went down behind the willows. With all the hurry of an imagination\r\nthat could never rest in the present, she sat in the deepening twilight\r\nforming plans of self-humiliation and entire devotedness; and in the\r\nardor of first discovery, renunciation seemed to her the entrance into\r\nthat satisfaction which she had so long been craving in vain. She had\r\nnot perceived\xe2\x80\x94how could she until she had lived longer?\xe2\x80\x94the inmost\r\ntruth of the old monk\xe2\x80\x99s out-pourings, that renunciation remains sorrow,\r\nthough a sorrow borne willingly. Maggie was still panting for\r\nhappiness, and was in ecstasy because she had found the key to it. She\r\nknew nothing of doctrines and systems, of mysticism or quietism; but\r\nthis voice out of the far-off middle ages was the direct communication\r\nof a human soul\xe2\x80\x99s belief and experience, and came to Maggie as an\r\nunquestioned message.\r\n\r\nI suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned book, for\r\nwhich you need only pay sixpence at a book-stall, works miracles to\r\nthis day, turning bitter waters into sweetness; while expensive sermons\r\nand treatises, newly issued, leave all things as they were before. It\r\nwas written down by a hand that waited for the heart\xe2\x80\x99s prompting; it is\r\nthe chronicle of a solitary, hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and\r\ntriumph, not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who\r\nare treading with bleeding feet on the stones. And so it remains to all\r\ntime a lasting record of human needs and human consolations; the voice\r\nof a brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered and renounced,\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ncloister, perhaps, with serge gown and tonsured head, with much\r\nchanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of speech different from\r\nours,\xe2\x80\x94but under the same silent far-off heavens, and with the same\r\npassionate desires, the same strivings, the same failures, the same\r\nweariness.\r\n\r\nIn writing the history of unfashionable families, one is apt to fall\r\ninto a tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good\r\nsociety, where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely\r\nmoderate kind, but are always presupposed, no subjects being eligible\r\nbut such as can be touched with a light and graceful irony. But then\r\ngood society has its claret and its velvet carpets, its\r\ndinner-engagements six weeks deep, its opera and its fa\xc3\xabry ball-rooms;\r\nrides off its _ennui_ on thoroughbred horses; lounges at the club; has\r\nto keep clear of crinoline vortices; gets its science done by Faraday,\r\nand its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best\r\nhouses,\xe2\x80\x94how should it have time or need for belief and emphasis? But\r\ngood society, floated on gossamer wings of light irony, is of very\r\nexpensive production; requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous\r\nnational life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories, cramping\r\nitself in mines, sweating at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving\r\nunder more or less oppression of carbonic acid, or else, spread over\r\nsheepwalks, and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or\r\nchalky corn-lands, where the rainy days look dreary. This wide national\r\nlife is based entirely on emphasis,\xe2\x80\x94the emphasis of want, which urges\r\nit into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of good\r\nsociety and light irony; it spends its heavy years often in a chill,\r\nuncarpeted fashion, amidst family discord unsoftened by long corridors.\r\nUnder such circumstances, there are many among its myriads of souls who\r\nhave absolutely needed an emphatic belief, life in this unpleasurable\r\nshape demanding some solution even to unspeculative minds,\xe2\x80\x94just as you\r\ninquire into the stuffing of your couch when anything galls you there,\r\nwhereas eider-down and perfect French springs excite no question. Some\r\nhave an emphatic belief in alcohol, and seek their _ekstasis_ or\r\noutside standing-ground in gin; but the rest require something that\r\ngood society calls \xe2\x80\x9centhusiasm,\xe2\x80\x9d something that will present motives in\r\nan entire absence of high prizes; something that will give patience and\r\nfeed human love when the limbs ache with weariness, and human looks are\r\nhard upon us; something, clearly, that lies outside personal desires,\r\nthat includes resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not\r\nourselves. Now and then that sort of enthusiasm finds a far-echoing\r\nvoice that comes from an experience springing out of the deepest need;\r\nand it was by being brought within the long lingering vibrations of\r\nsuch a voice that Maggie, with her girl\xe2\x80\x99s face and unnoted sorrows,\r\nfound an effort and a hope that helped her through years of loneliness,\r\nmaking out a faith for herself without the aid of established\r\nauthorities and appointed guides; for they were not at hand, and her\r\nneed was pressing. From what you know of her, you will not be surprised\r\nthat she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness, some pride and\r\nimpetuosity, even into her self-renunciation; her own life was still a\r\ndrama for her, in which she demanded of herself that her part should be\r\nplayed with intensity. And so it came to pass that she often lost the\r\nspirit of humility by being excessive in the outward act; she often\r\nstrove after too high a flight, and came down with her poor little\r\nhalf-fledged wings dabbled in the mud. For example, she not only\r\ndetermined to work at plain sewing, that she might contribute something\r\ntoward the fund in the tin box, but she went, in the first instance, in\r\nher zeal of self-mortification, to ask for it at a linen shop in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way; and\r\ncould see nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind, nay,\r\npersecuting, in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s reproof of her for this unnecessary act. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike _my_ sister to do such things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ take care that\r\nthe debts are paid, without your lowering yourself in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d Surely\r\nthere was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the worldliness and\r\nself-assertion of that little speech; but Maggie held it as dross,\r\noverlooking the grains of gold, and took Tom\xe2\x80\x99s rebuke as one of her\r\noutward crosses. Tom was very hard to her, she used to think, in her\r\nlong night-watchings,\xe2\x80\x94to her who had always loved him so; and then she\r\nstrove to be contented with that hardness, and to require nothing. That\r\nis the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of\r\negoism,\xe2\x80\x94the path of martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches\r\ngrow, rather than the steep highway of tolerance, just allowance, and\r\nself-blame, where there are no leafy honours to be gathered and worn.\r\n\r\nThe old books, Virgil, Euclid, and Aldrich\xe2\x80\x94that wrinkled fruit of the\r\ntree of knowledge\xe2\x80\x94had been all laid by; for Maggie had turned her back\r\non the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise. In her first\r\nardor she flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had\r\nrisen above the need of them; and if they had been her own, she would\r\nhave burned them, believing that she would never repent. She read so\r\neagerly and constantly in her three books, the Bible, Thomas \xc3\xa0 Kempis,\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cChristian Year\xe2\x80\x9d (no longer rejected as a \xe2\x80\x9chymn-book\xe2\x80\x9d), that\r\nthey filled her mind with a continual stream of rhythmic memories; and\r\nshe was too ardently learning to see all nature and life in the light\r\nof her new faith, to need any other material for her mind to work on,\r\nas she sat with her well-plied needle, making shirts and other\r\ncomplicated stitchings, falsely called \xe2\x80\x9cplain,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by no means plain to\r\nMaggie, since wristband and sleeve and the like had a capability of\r\nbeing sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental wandering.\r\n\r\nHanging diligently over her sewing, Maggie was a sight any one might\r\nhave been pleased to look at. That new inward life of hers,\r\nnotwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet\r\nshone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as\r\nadded loveliness with the gradually enriched colour and outline of her\r\nblossoming youth. Her mother felt the change in her with a sort of\r\npuzzled wonder that Maggie should be \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing up so good\xe2\x80\x9d; it was\r\namazing that this once \xe2\x80\x9ccontrairy\xe2\x80\x9d child was become so submissive, so\r\nbackward to assert her own will. Maggie used to look up from her work\r\nand find her mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed upon her; they were watching and\r\nwaiting for the large young glance, as if her elder frame got some\r\nneedful warmth from it. The mother was getting fond of her tall, brown\r\ngirl,\xe2\x80\x94the only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her\r\nanxiety and pride; and Maggie, in spite of her own ascetic wish to have\r\nno personal adornment, was obliged to give way to her mother about her\r\nhair, and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited into a\r\ncoronet on the summit of her head, after the pitiable fashion of those\r\nantiquated times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your mother have that bit o\xe2\x80\x99 pleasure, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nTulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d trouble enough with your hair once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Maggie, glad of anything that would soothe her mother, and cheer\r\ntheir long day together, consented to the vain decoration, and showed a\r\nqueenly head above her old frocks, steadily refusing, however, to look\r\nat herself in the glass. Mrs Tulliver liked to call the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s hair and other unexpected virtues, but he had a\r\nbrusque reply to give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew well enough what she\xe2\x80\x99d be, before now,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new to me.\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she isn\xe2\x80\x99t made o\xe2\x80\x99 commoner stuff; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be thrown\r\naway, I doubt,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nobody to marry her as is fit for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s graces of mind and body fed his gloom. He sat patiently\r\nenough while she read him a chapter, or said something timidly when\r\nthey were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing. He\r\ntook it all as part of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s goodness, which made his\r\nmisfortunes the sadder to him because they damaged her chance in life.\r\nIn a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied\r\nvindictiveness, there is no room for new feelings; Mr Tulliver did not\r\nwant spiritual consolation\xe2\x80\x94he wanted to shake off the degradation of\r\ndebt, and to have his revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH\r\n\r\nWHEAT AND TARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Deeps\r\n\r\nThe family sitting-room was a long room with a window at each end; one\r\nlooking toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the\r\nFloss, the other into the mill-yard. Maggie was sitting with her work\r\nagainst the latter window when she saw Mr Wakem entering the yard, as\r\nusual, on his fine black horse; but not alone, as usual. Some one was\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x94a figure in a cloak, on a handsome pony. Maggie had hardly\r\ntime to feel that it was Philip come back, before they were in front of\r\nthe window, and he was raising his hat to her; while his father,\r\ncatching the movement by a side-glance, looked sharply round at them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nMaggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs; for\r\nMr Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books, and Maggie felt\r\nthat the meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the\r\npresence of the two fathers. Some day, perhaps, she could see him when\r\nthey could just shake hands, and she could tell him that she remembered\r\nhis goodness to Tom, and the things he had said to her in the old days,\r\nthough they could never be friends any more. It was not at all\r\nagitating to Maggie to see Philip again; she retained her childish\r\ngratitude and pity toward him, and remembered his cleverness; and in\r\nthe early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the\r\nimage of him among the people who had been kind to her in life, often\r\nwishing she had him for a brother and a teacher, as they had fancied it\r\nmight have been, in their talk together. But that sort of wishing had\r\nbeen banished along with other dreams that savored of seeking her own\r\nwill; and she thought, besides, that Philip might be altered by his\r\nlife abroad,\xe2\x80\x94he might have become worldly, and really not care about\r\nher saying anything to him now. And yet his face was wonderfully little\r\naltered,\xe2\x80\x94it was only a larger, more manly copy of the pale,\r\nsmall-featured boy\xe2\x80\x99s face, with the gray eyes, and the boyish waving\r\nbrown hair; there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity; and\r\nafter all her meditations, Maggie felt that she really _should_ like to\r\nsay a few words to him. He might still be melancholy, as he always used\r\nto be, and like her to look at him kindly. She wondered if he\r\nremembered how he used to like her eyes; with that thought Maggie\r\nglanced toward the square looking-glass which was condemned to hang\r\nwith its face toward the wall, and she half started from her seat to\r\nreach it down; but she checked herself and snatched up her work, trying\r\nto repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory to recall snatches\r\nof hymns, until she saw Philip and his father returning along the road,\r\nand she could go down again.\r\n\r\nIt was far on in June now, and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the\r\ndaily walk which was her one indulgence; but this day and the following\r\nshe was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went\r\nbeyond the gate, and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out\r\nof doors. One of her frequent walks, when she was not obliged to go to\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, was to a spot that lay beyond what was called the \xe2\x80\x9cHill,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an\r\ninsignificant rise of ground crowned by trees, lying along the side of\r\nthe road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote Mill. Insignificant I call\r\nit, because in height it was hardly more than a bank; but there may\r\ncome moments when Nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful\r\nresult; and that is why I ask you to imagine this high bank crowned\r\nwith trees, making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the\r\nleft side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it, bounded\r\nby the murmuring Ripple. Just where this line of bank sloped down again\r\nto the level, a by-road turned off and led to the other side of the\r\nrise, where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by\r\nthe working of an exhausted stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both\r\nmounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees, and here\r\nand there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept close-nibbled.\r\nIn her childish days Maggie held this place, called the Red Deeps, in\r\nvery great awe, and needed all her confidence in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s bravery to\r\nreconcile her to an excursion thither,\xe2\x80\x94visions of robbers and fierce\r\nanimals haunting every hollow. But now it had the charm for her which\r\nany broken ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that\r\nrest habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she could sit\r\non a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant\r\nfrom the steep above her, and listen to the hum of insects, like\r\ntiniest bells on the garment of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing\r\nthe distant boughs, as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly\r\nblue of the wild hyacinths. In this June time, too, the dog-roses were\r\nin their glory, and that was an additional reason why Maggie should\r\ndirect her walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot, on the\r\nfirst day she was free to wander at her will,\xe2\x80\x94a pleasure she loved so\r\nwell, that sometimes, in her ardors of renunciation, she thought she\r\nought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.\r\n\r\nYou may see her now, as she walks down the favourite turning and enters\r\nthe Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her tall\r\nfigure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk\r\nshawl of some wide-meshed net-like material; and now she is sure of\r\nbeing unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm. One\r\nwould certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her\r\nseventeenth year\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the\r\nglance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed; perhaps\r\nbecause her broad-chested figure has the mould of early womanhood.\r\nYouth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary\r\nhardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain on the hard\r\nfloor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid,\r\nthe brown cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her dark\r\ncolouring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure, she seems to have\r\na sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs, at which she is looking\r\nup as if she loved them well. Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in\r\nlooking at her,\xe2\x80\x94a sense of opposing elements, of which a fierce\r\ncollision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression, such as one\r\noften sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with\r\nthe resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden,\r\npassionate glance, that will dissipate all the quietude, like a damp\r\nfire leaping out again when all seemed safe.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment. She was calmly\r\nenjoying the free air, while she looked up at the old fir-trees, and\r\nthought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past\r\nstorms, which had only made the red stems soar higher. But while her\r\neyes were still turned upward, she became conscious of a moving shadow\r\ncast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her, and looked down\r\nwith a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who first raised his hat,\r\nand then, blushing deeply, came forward to her and put out his hand.\r\nMaggie, too, coloured with surprise, which soon gave way to pleasure.\r\nShe put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her\r\nwith frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of\r\nher child\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\xe2\x80\x94a memory that was always strong in her. She was\r\nthe first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou startled me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling faintly; \xe2\x80\x9cI never meet any one\r\nhere. How came you to be walking here? Did you come to meet _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, still embarrassed; \xe2\x80\x9cI wished to see you very\r\nmuch. I watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your house to\r\nsee if you would come out, but you never came. Then I watched again\r\nto-day, and when I saw the way you took, I kept you in sight and came\r\ndown the bank, behind there. I hope you will not be displeased with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with simple seriousness, walking on as if she meant\r\nPhilip to accompany her, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad you came, for I wished very\r\nmuch to have an opportunity of speaking to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never forgotten\r\nhow good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure that\r\nyou would remember us so well. Tom and I have had a great deal of\r\ntrouble since then, and I think _that_ makes one think more of what\r\nhappened before the trouble came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that you have thought of me so much as I have thought\r\nof you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, when I was away, I made a\r\npicture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you said\r\nyou would not forget me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip drew a large miniature-case from his pocket, and opened it.\r\nMaggie saw her old self leaning on a table, with her black locks\r\nhanging down behind her ears, looking into space, with strange, dreamy\r\neyes. It was a water-colour sketch, of real merit as a portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, and flushed with pleasure, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nqueer little girl I was! I remember myself with my hair in that way, in\r\nthat pink frock. I really _was_ like a gypsy. I dare say I am now,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, after a little pause; \xe2\x80\x9cam I like what you expected me to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words might have been those of a coquette, but the full, bright\r\nglance Maggie turned on Philip was not that of a coquette. She really\r\ndid hope he liked her face as it was now, but it was simply the rising\r\nagain of her innate delight in admiration and love. Philip met her eyes\r\nand looked at her in silence for a long moment, before he said quietly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light died out a little from Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, and there was a slight\r\ntrembling of the lip. Her eyelids fell lower, but she did not turn away\r\nher head, and Philip continued to look at her. Then he said slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, the pleasure returning in a deeper flush. She\r\nturned her face away from him and took some steps, looking straight\r\nbefore her in silence, as if she were adjusting her consciousness to\r\nthis new idea. Girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main\r\nground of vanity, that, in abstaining from the looking-glass, Maggie\r\nhad thought more of abandoning all care for adornment than of\r\nrenouncing the contemplation of her face. Comparing herself with\r\nelegant, wealthy young ladies, it had not occurred to her that she\r\ncould produce any effect with her person. Philip seemed to like the\r\nsilence well. He walked by her side, watching her face, as if that\r\nsight left no room for any other wish. They had passed from among the\r\nfir-trees, and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an\r\namphitheatre of the pale pink dog-roses. But as the light about them\r\nhad brightened, Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face had lost its glow.\r\n\r\nShe stood still when they were in the hollows, and looking at Philip\r\nagain, she said in a serious, sad voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could have been friends,\xe2\x80\x94I mean, if it would have been good\r\nand right for us. But that is the trial I have to bear in everything; I\r\nmay not keep anything I used to love when I was little. The old books\r\nwent; and Tom is different, and my father. It is like death. I must\r\npart with everything I cared for when I was a child. And I must part\r\nwith you; we must never take any notice of each other again. That was\r\nwhat I wanted to speak to you for. I wanted to let you know that Tom\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t do as we like about such things, and that if I behave as if\r\nI had forgotten all about you, it is not out of envy or pride\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94or any\r\nbad feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on,\r\nand her eyes began to fill with tears. The deepening expression of pain\r\non Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self,\r\nand made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; I see all that you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice that had become\r\nfeebler from discouragement; \xe2\x80\x9cI know what there is to keep us apart on\r\nboth sides. But it is not right, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you be angry with me, I\r\nam so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts,\xe2\x80\x94it is not right to\r\nsacrifice everything to other people\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable feelings. I would\r\ngive up a great deal for _my_ father; but I would not give up a\r\nfriendship or\xe2\x80\x94or an attachment of any sort, in obedience to any wish of\r\nhis that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise as right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOften, when I have been angry\r\nand discontented, it has seemed to me that I was not bound to give up\r\nanything; and I have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that I\r\ncould think away all my duty. But no good has ever come of that; it was\r\nan evil state of mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure that whatever I might do, I\r\nshould wish in the end that I had gone without anything for myself,\r\nrather than have made my father\xe2\x80\x99s life harder to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would it make his life harder if we were to see each other\r\nsometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. He was going to say something else, but\r\nchecked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me why, or anything about\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a distressed tone. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father feels so strongly\r\nabout some things. He is not at all happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, impetuously; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least\xe2\x80\x94I ought not to ask\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m very,\r\nvery sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip turned to walk on, as if he had not patience to stand still any\r\nlonger, and they went out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and\r\nbushes in silence. After that last word of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, Maggie could not\r\nbear to insist immediately on their parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a great deal happier,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, timidly, \xe2\x80\x9csince I\r\nhave given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant, and being\r\ndiscontented because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have my own will. Our life is\r\ndetermined for us; and it makes the mind very free when we give up\r\nwishing, and only think of bearing what is laid upon us, and doing what\r\nis given us to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t give up wishing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly\r\nalive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and\r\nwe _must_ hunger after them. How can we ever be satisfied without them\r\nuntil our feelings are deadened? I delight in fine pictures; I long to\r\nbe able to paint such. I strive and strive, and can\xe2\x80\x99t produce what I\r\nwant. That is pain to me, and always _will_ be pain, until my faculties\r\nlose their keenness, like aged eyes. Then there are many other things I\r\nlong for,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Philip hesitated a little, and then said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthings that\r\nother men have, and that will always be denied me. My life will have\r\nnothing great or beautiful in it; I would rather not have lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so.\xe2\x80\x9d But her heart\r\nbegan to beat with something of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s discontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning quickly round and fixing his gray eyes\r\nentreatingly on her face, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be contented to live, if you would\r\nlet me see you sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, checked by a fear which her face\r\nsuggested, he looked away again and said more calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no friend\r\nto whom I can tell everything, no one who cares enough about me; and if\r\nI could only see you now and then, and you would let me talk to you a\r\nlittle, and show me that you cared for me, and that we may always be\r\nfriends in heart, and help each other, then I might come to be glad of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I see you, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, falteringly. (Could she\r\nreally do him good? It would be very hard to say \xe2\x80\x9cgood-by\xe2\x80\x9d this day,\r\nand not speak to him again. Here was a new interest to vary the days;\r\nit was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would let me see you here sometimes,\xe2\x80\x94walk with you here,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould be contented if it were only once or twice in a month. _That_\r\ncould injure no one\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and it would sweeten my life.\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip went on, with all the inventive astuteness of love at\r\none-and-twenty, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is any enmity between those who belong to us,\r\nwe ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship; I mean,\r\nthat by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing of\r\nthe wounds that have been made in the past, if I could know everything\r\nabout them. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is any enmity in my own father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind; I think he has proved the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie shook her head slowly, and was silent, under conflicting\r\nthoughts. It seemed to her inclination, that to see Philip now and\r\nthen, and keep up the bond of friendship with him, was something not\r\nonly innocent, but good; perhaps she might really help him to find\r\ncontentment as she had found it. The voice that said this made sweet\r\nmusic to Maggie; but athwart it there came an urgent, monotonous\r\nwarning from another voice which she had been learning to obey,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwarning that such interviews implied secrecy; implied doing something\r\nshe would dread to be discovered in, something that, if discovered,\r\nmust cause anger and pain; and that the admission of anything so near\r\ndoubleness would act as a spiritual blight. Yet the music would swell\r\nout again, like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze, persuading\r\nher that the wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others, and\r\nthat there was such a thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury\r\nof another. It was very cruel for Philip that he should be shrunk from,\r\nbecause of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his father,\xe2\x80\x94poor\r\nPhilip, whom some people would shrink from only because he was\r\ndeformed. The idea that he might become her lover or that her meeting\r\nhim could cause disapproval in that light, had not occurred to her; and\r\nPhilip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough, saw it with a\r\ncertain pang, although it made her consent to his request the less\r\nunlikely. There was bitterness to him in the perception that Maggie was\r\nalmost as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say either yes or no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, turning round and\r\nwalking toward the way she come; \xe2\x80\x9cI must wait, lest I should decide\r\nwrongly. I must seek for guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come again, then, to-morrow, or the next day, or next week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I had better write,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, faltering again. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to\r\ngo to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes, and I can put the letter in the post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat would not be so well. My father\r\nmight see the letter\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94he has not any enmity, I believe, but he views\r\nthings differently from me; he thinks a great deal about wealth and\r\nposition. Pray let me come here once more. _Tell_ me when it shall be;\r\nor if you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, I will come as often as I can till I do see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it must be so, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I can\xe2\x80\x99t be quite\r\ncertain of coming here any particular evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision. She was free now\r\nto enjoy the minutes of companionship; she almost thought she might\r\nlinger a little; the next time they met she should have to pain Philip\r\nby telling him her determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking smilingly at him, after a\r\nfew moments of silence, \xe2\x80\x9chow strange it is that we should have met and\r\ntalked to each other, just as if it had been only yesterday when we\r\nparted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those\r\nfive years,\xe2\x80\x94I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a\r\nsort of feeling that I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure\r\nthat you would be the same; I know you are so clever, and you must have\r\nseen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you\r\nwould care about me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I\r\nmight see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, the same in everything that made\r\nme like you better than any one else. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to explain that; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of\r\ncan ever be explained. We can neither detect the process by which they\r\nare arrived at, nor the mode in which they act on us. The greatest of\r\npainters only once painted a mysteriously divine child; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave told how he did it, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t tell why we feel it to be divine.\r\nI think there are stores laid up in our human nature that our\r\nunderstandings can make no complete inventory of. Certain strains of\r\nmusic affect me so strangely; I can never hear them without their\r\nchanging my whole attitude of mind for a time, and if the effect would\r\nlast, I might be capable of heroisms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I know what you mean about music; _I_ feel so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nclasping her hands with her old impetuosity. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in\r\na saddened tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI used to feel so when I had any music; I never have\r\nany now except the organ at church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you long for it, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, looking at her with\r\naffectionate pity. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you can have very little that is beautiful in\r\nyour life. Have you many books? You were so fond of them when you were\r\na little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were come back to the hollow, round which the dog-roses grew, and\r\nthey both paused under the charm of the fa\xc3\xabry evening light, reflected\r\nfrom the pale pink clusters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have given up books,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept a very, very\r\nfew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had already taken from his pocket a small volume, and was\r\nlooking at the back as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is the second volume, I see, else you might have liked to\r\ntake it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am studying a\r\nscene for a picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie had looked at the back too, and saw the title; it revived an old\r\nimpression with overmastering force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Pirate,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking the book from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s hands. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nbegan that once; I read to where Minna is walking with Cleveland, and I\r\ncould never get to read the rest. I went on with it in my own head, and\r\nI made several endings; but they were all unhappy. I could never make a\r\nhappy ending out of that beginning. Poor Minna! I wonder what is the\r\nreal end. For a long while I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get my mind away from the\r\nShetland Isles,\xe2\x80\x94I used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough\r\nsea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie spoke rapidly, with glistening eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that volume home with you, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, watching her\r\nwith delight. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it now. I shall make a picture of you\r\ninstead,\xe2\x80\x94you, among the Scotch firs and the slanting shadows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie had not heard a word he had said; she was absorbed in a page at\r\nwhich she had opened. But suddenly she closed the book, and gave it\r\nback to Philip, shaking her head with a backward movement, as if to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cavaunt\xe2\x80\x9d to floating visions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo keep it, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, entreatingly; \xe2\x80\x9cit will give you\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, putting it aside with her hand and\r\nwalking on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would make me in love with this world again, as I used\r\nto be; it would make me long to see and know many things; it would make\r\nme long for a full life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will not always be shut up in your present lot; why should you\r\nstarve your mind in that way? It is narrow asceticism; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nsee you persisting in it, Maggie. Poetry and art and knowledge are\r\nsacred and pure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not for me, not for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, walking more hurriedly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I should want too much. I must wait; this life will not last\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurry away from me without saying \xe2\x80\x98good-by,\xe2\x80\x99 Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, as they reached the group of Scotch firs, and she continued\r\nstill to walk along without speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI must not go any farther, I\r\nthink, must I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I forgot; good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, pausing, and putting out her\r\nhand to him. The action brought her feeling back in a strong current to\r\nPhilip; and after they had stood looking at each other in silence for a\r\nfew moments, with their hands clasped, she said, withdrawing her hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years. It is\r\nvery sweet to have people love us. What a wonderful, beautiful thing it\r\nseems that God should have made your heart so that you could care about\r\na queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks! I remember\r\nsaying to you that I thought you cared for me more than Tom did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, almost fretfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would never love me\r\nso well as you love your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, simply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then, you know, the first\r\nthing I ever remember in my life is standing with Tom by the side of\r\nthe Floss, while he held my hand; everything before that is dark to me.\r\nBut I shall never forget you, though we must keep apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I kept that little girl in my\r\nmind for five years, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I earn some part in her? She ought not to\r\ntake herself quite away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I were free,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not, I must submit.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhesitated a moment, and then added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wanted to say to you, that\r\nyou had better not take more notice of my brother than just bowing to\r\nhim. He once told me not to speak to you again, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change\r\nhis mind\xe2\x80\x94Oh dear, the sun is set. I am too long away. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ngave him her hand once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come here as often as I can till I see you again, Maggie. Have\r\nsome feeling for _me_ as well as for others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, hurrying away, and quickly\r\ndisappearing behind the last fir-tree; though Philip\xe2\x80\x99s gaze after her\r\nremained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still.\r\n\r\nMaggie went home, with an inward conflict already begun; Philip went\r\nhome to do nothing but remember and hope. You can hardly help blaming\r\nhim severely. He was four or five years older than Maggie, and had a\r\nfull consciousness of his feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing\r\nthe character his contemplated interviews with her would bear in the\r\nopinion of a third person. But you must not suppose that he was capable\r\nof a gross selfishness, or that he could have been satisfied without\r\npersuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some happiness into\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x94seeking this even more than any direct ends for himself.\r\nHe could give her sympathy; he could give her help. There was not the\r\nslightest promise of love toward him in her manner; it was nothing more\r\nthan the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she was\r\ntwelve. Perhaps she would never love him; perhaps no woman ever _could_\r\nlove him. Well, then, he would endure that; he should at least have the\r\nhappiness of seeing her, of feeling some nearness to her. And he\r\nclutched passionately the possibility that she _might_ love him;\r\nperhaps the feeling would grow, if she could come to associate him with\r\nthat watchful tenderness which her nature would be so keenly alive to.\r\nIf any woman could love him, surely Maggie was that woman; there was\r\nsuch wealth of love in her, and there was no one to claim it all. Then,\r\nthe pity of it, that a mind like hers should be withering in its very\r\nyouth, like a young forest-tree, for want of the light and space it was\r\nformed to flourish in! Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out\r\nof her system of privation? He would be her guardian angel; he would do\r\nanything, bear anything, for her sake\xe2\x80\x94except not seeing her.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nAunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Thumb\r\n\r\nWhile Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own\r\nsoul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows forever\r\nrising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling\r\nwith more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests.\r\nSo it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of\r\nhorses; inside the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted\r\nhands offering prayers, watching the world\xe2\x80\x99s combat from afar, filling\r\ntheir long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in\r\nfierce struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the\r\nstronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread and even of wounds\r\nin the hurrying ardor of action.\r\n\r\nFrom what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you\r\nwould prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers\r\nare likely to be on his side, notwithstanding his small success in the\r\nclassics. For Tom had never desired success in this field of\r\nenterprise; and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity\r\nthere is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects\r\nin which it feels no interest. But now Tom\xe2\x80\x99s strong will bound together\r\nhis integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and his personal\r\nambition, and made them one force, concentrating his efforts and\r\nsurmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane, who watched him closely,\r\nsoon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he had\r\nbrought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be\r\nmade of such good commercial stuff. The real kindness of placing him in\r\nthe warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle\r\nbegan to throw out, that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to\r\ntravel at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar\r\ncommodities with which I need not shock refined ears in this place; and\r\nit was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr Deane, when he\r\nexpected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with\r\nhim an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising\r\nconcerning articles of export and import, with an occasional excursus\r\nof more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsubject on which Mr Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few\r\nsparks when he got warmed with talk and wine.\r\n\r\nAlready, in the second year, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s salary was raised; but all, except\r\nthe price of his dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he\r\nshunned comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of\r\nhimself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious\r\nApprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure,\xe2\x80\x94would have\r\nliked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all\r\nneighbouring eyes, dispensing treats and benefits to others with\r\nwell-judged liberality, and being pronounced one of the finest young\r\nfellows of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve these things\r\nsooner or later; but his practical shrewdness told him that the means\r\nto such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and\r\nself-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the\r\nfirst was the payment of his father\xe2\x80\x99s debts. Having made up his mind on\r\nthat point, he strode along without swerving, contracting some rather\r\nsaturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature\r\ncall upon him for self-reliance. Tom felt intensely that common cause\r\nwith his father which springs from family pride, and was bent on being\r\nirreproachable as a son; but his growing experience caused him to pass\r\nmuch silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast conduct; their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nshowed little radiance during his few home hours. Maggie had an awe of\r\nhim, against which she struggled as something unfair to her\r\nconsciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no\r\nuse to struggle. A character at unity with itself\xe2\x80\x94that performs what it\r\nintends, subdues every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond\r\nthe distinctly possible\xe2\x80\x94is strong by its very negations.\r\n\r\nYou may imagine that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s more and more obvious unlikeness to his\r\nfather was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and\r\nMr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s favourable reports and predictions to Mr Glegg concerning\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them\r\nwith various acceptance. He was likely, it appeared, to do the family\r\ncredit without causing it any expense and trouble. Mrs Pullet had\r\nalways thought it strange if Tom\xe2\x80\x99s excellent complexion, so entirely\r\nthat of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he would turn out\r\nwell; his juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and general\r\ndisrespect to his aunts, only indicating a tinge of Tulliver blood\r\nwhich he had doubtless outgrown. Mr Glegg, who had contracted a\r\ncautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour\r\nwhen the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution\r\nto further his prospects actively,\xe2\x80\x94some time, when an opportunity\r\noffered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs\r\nGlegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some\r\npeople were; that those who said least were most likely to find their\r\nwords made good; and that when the right moment came, it would be seen\r\nwho could do something better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after silent\r\nmeditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to the\r\nconclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it was better\r\nnot to meddle with him.\r\n\r\nTom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but\r\nhimself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of\r\nfavourable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him\r\nsometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be\r\ninvited to dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on\r\nthe ground that he was not sure of being punctual. But about a year\r\nago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriendly disposition.\r\n\r\nBob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing\r\nTom and Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s one evening, that they might have a little private talk. He took\r\nthe liberty of asking if Mr Tom had ever thought of making money by\r\ntrading a bit on his own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know.\r\nWhy, by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had\r\na particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in\r\nthat way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr Tom on the\r\nsame footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for full\r\nexplanation, wondering he had not thought of this plan before.\r\n\r\nHe was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might\r\nchange the slow process of addition into multiplication, that he at\r\nonce determined to mention the matter to his father, and get his\r\nconsent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the\r\npurchase of a small cargo. He would rather not have consulted his\r\nfather, but he had just paid his last quarter\xe2\x80\x99s money into the tin box,\r\nand there was no other resource. All the savings were there; for Mr\r\nTulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he\r\nshould lose it. Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn,\r\nand had lost by it, he could not be easy without keeping the money\r\nunder his eye.\r\n\r\nTom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth\r\nwith his father that evening, and Mr Tulliver listened, leaning forward\r\nin his arm-chair and looking up in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face with a sceptical glance.\r\nHis first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some\r\nawe of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, and since he had the sense of being an \xe2\x80\x9cunlucky\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfather, he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to\r\nbe master. He took the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the\r\nkey of the large chest, and fetched down the tin box,\xe2\x80\x94slowly, as if he\r\nwere trying to defer the moment of a painful parting. Then he seated\r\nhimself against the table, and opened the box with that little\r\npadlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant\r\nmoments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the bright\r\nsovereigns, and he counted them out on the table\xe2\x80\x94only a hundred and\r\nsixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you want, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking as if the words burnt\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over\r\nit, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as much as I can save out o\xe2\x80\x99 my pay in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we\r\nget. And in this way we might double our savings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, keeping his hand on the money, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nmight lose it,\xe2\x80\x94you might lose a year o\xe2\x80\x99 my life,\xe2\x80\x94and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nmany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay a dividend with the first hundred, because\r\nI wanted to see it all in a lump,\xe2\x80\x94and when I see it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure on\xe2\x80\x99t. If\r\nyou trust to luck, it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be against me. It\xe2\x80\x99s Old Harry\xe2\x80\x99s got the\r\nluck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up\r\nagain; death \xe2\x80\x99ull o\xe2\x80\x99ertake me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes\r\nbefore he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask\r\nhis uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving\r\nfive per cent. of the profits. That was really a very small thing to\r\nask. So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision,\r\nTom proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s to open\r\nthe business; for his diffident pride clung to him, and made him feel\r\nthat Bobs\xe2\x80\x99 tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment.\r\n\r\nMr Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August\r\nday, was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the\r\nsum total had not varied since yesterday. To him entered Tom, in what\r\nappeared to Mr Glegg very questionable companionship,\xe2\x80\x94that of a man\r\nwith a pack on his back,\xe2\x80\x94for Bob was equipped for a new journey,\xe2\x80\x94and of\r\na huge brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement\r\nfrom side to side, and glanced from under his eye-lids with a surly\r\nindifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nMr Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the\r\nfruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, snatching up\r\na stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were\r\nwithin three yards of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, Mumps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, with a kick. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as quiet as a\r\nlamb, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as\r\nhe retreated behind his master\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what ever does this mean, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought\r\ninformation about the scoundrels as cut my trees?\xe2\x80\x9d If Bob came in the\r\ncharacter of \xe2\x80\x9cinformation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cI came to speak to you about a little matter of\r\nbusiness of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94well; but what has this dog got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\ngentleman, getting mild again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my dog, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ready Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s me as put Mr Tom up\r\nto the bit o\xe2\x80\x99 business; for Mr Tom\xe2\x80\x99s been a friend o\xe2\x80\x99 mine iver since I\r\nwas a little chap; fust thing iver I did was frightenin\xe2\x80\x99 the birds for\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 old master. An\xe2\x80\x99 if a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 luck turns up, I\xe2\x80\x99m allays thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 if I\r\ncan let Mr Tom have a pull at it. An\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s a downright roarin\xe2\x80\x99 shame,\r\nas when he\xe2\x80\x99s got the chance o\xe2\x80\x99 making a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 money wi\xe2\x80\x99 sending goods\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x94ten or twelve per zent clear, when freight an\xe2\x80\x99 commission\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npaid,\xe2\x80\x94as he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay hold o\xe2\x80\x99 the chance for want o\xe2\x80\x99 money. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen there\xe2\x80\x99s the Laceham goods,\xe2\x80\x94lors! they\xe2\x80\x99re made o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for folks\r\nas want to send out a little carguy; light, an\xe2\x80\x99 take up no room,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nmay pack twenty pound so as you can\xe2\x80\x99t see the passill; an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmanifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they aren\xe2\x80\x99t like to want a\r\nmarket. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d go to Laceham an\xe2\x80\x99 buy in the goods for Mr Tom along wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy own. An\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s the shupercargo o\xe2\x80\x99 the bit of a vessel as is goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto take \xe2\x80\x99em out. I know him partic\xe2\x80\x99lar; he\xe2\x80\x99s a solid man, an\xe2\x80\x99 got a\r\nfamily i\xe2\x80\x99 the town here. Salt, his name is,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 a briny chap he is\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, I can take you to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed\r\nloquacity, with which his understanding could hardly keep pace. He\r\nlooked at Bob, first over his spectacles, then through them, then over\r\nthem again; while Tom, doubtful of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s impression, began to\r\nwish he had not brought this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s talk\r\nappeared less seemly, now some one besides himself was listening to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be a knowing fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir, you say true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Bob, nodding his head aside; \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nmy head\xe2\x80\x99s all alive inside like an old cheese, for I\xe2\x80\x99m so full o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nplans, one knocks another over. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t Mumps to talk to, I should\r\nget top-heavy an\xe2\x80\x99 tumble in a fit. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because I niver went\r\nto school much. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I jaw my old mother for. I says, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nshould ha\xe2\x80\x99 sent me to school a bit more,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 then I could ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nread i\xe2\x80\x99 the books like fun, an\xe2\x80\x99 kep\xe2\x80\x99 my head cool an\xe2\x80\x99 empty.\xe2\x80\x99 Lors,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s fine an\xe2\x80\x99 comfor\xe2\x80\x99ble now, my old mother is; she ates her baked\r\nmeat an\xe2\x80\x99 taters as often as she likes. For I\xe2\x80\x99m gettin\xe2\x80\x99 so full o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmoney, I must hev a wife to spend it for me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s botherin,\xe2\x80\x99 a wife\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x94and Mumps mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired\r\nfrom business, was beginning to find Bob amusing, but he had still a\r\ndisapproving observation to make, which kept his face serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you\xe2\x80\x99re at a loss for ways o\xe2\x80\x99 spending\r\nyour money, else you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep that big dog, to eat as much as two\r\nChristians. It\xe2\x80\x99s shameful\xe2\x80\x94shameful!\xe2\x80\x9d But he spoke more in sorrow than\r\nin anger, and quickly added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, come now, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose you\r\nwant a little sum to make a venture with. But where\xe2\x80\x99s all your own\r\nmoney? You don\xe2\x80\x99t spend it all\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, colouring; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my father is unwilling to risk it,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to press him. If I could get twenty or thirty pounds\r\nto begin with, I could pay five per cent for it, and then I could\r\ngradually make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, in an approving tone; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad notion,\r\nand I won\xe2\x80\x99t say as I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be your man. But it \xe2\x80\x99ull be as well for\r\nme to see this Salt, as you talk on. And then\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s this friend o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyours offers to buy the goods for you. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody to\r\nstand surety for you if the money\xe2\x80\x99s put into your hands?\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\ncautious old gentleman, looking over his spectacles at Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I mean it\r\nwould not be necessary for me, because I know Bob well; but perhaps it\r\nwould be right for you to have some security.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get your percentage out o\xe2\x80\x99 the purchase, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nGlegg, looking at Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, rather indignantly; \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to get a apple\r\nfor Mr Tom, o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to hev a bite out of it myself. When I play\r\nfolks tricks, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be more fun in \xe2\x80\x99em nor that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but right you should have a small percentage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no opinion o\xe2\x80\x99 transactions where folks do things\r\nfor nothing. It allays looks bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was implied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I get by\xe2\x80\x99t, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s money in my pocket in the\r\nend,\xe2\x80\x94I make myself look big, wi\xe2\x80\x99 makin\xe2\x80\x99 a bigger purchase. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking on. Lors! I\xe2\x80\x99m a \xe2\x80\x99cute chap,\xe2\x80\x94I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg, Mr Glegg!\xe2\x80\x9d said a severe voice from the open parlour window,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpray are you coming in to tea, or are you going to stand talking with\r\npackmen till you get murdered in the open daylight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurdered?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the woman talking of? Here\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nnephey Tom come about a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurdered,\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t many \xe2\x80\x99sizes ago since a packman murdered a\r\nyoung woman in a lone place, and stole her thimble, and threw her body\r\ninto a ditch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, soothingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 the man wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nno legs, as drove a dog-cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing, Mr Glegg, only you\xe2\x80\x99re fond o\xe2\x80\x99 contradicting\r\nwhat I say; and if my nephey\xe2\x80\x99s come about business, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be more\r\nfitting if you\xe2\x80\x99d bring him into the house, and let his aunt know about\r\nit, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 whispering in corners, in that plotting, underminding\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll come in now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady to Bob, in a loud voice, adapted\r\nto the moral, not the physical, distance between them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nanything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deal wi\xe2\x80\x99 packmen. Mind you shut the gate after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit; not so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg; \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t done with this\r\nyoung man yet. Come in, Tom; come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, stepping in at the\r\nFrench window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs G., in a fatal tone, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re going to let that\r\nman and his dog in on my carpet, before my very face, be so good as to\r\nlet me know. A wife\xe2\x80\x99s got a right to ask that, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be uneasy, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, touching his cap. He saw at once\r\nthat Mrs Glegg was a bit of game worth running down, and longed to be\r\nat the sport; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll stay out upo\xe2\x80\x99 the gravel here,\xe2\x80\x94Mumps and me will.\r\nMumps knows his company,\xe2\x80\x94he does. I might hish at him by th\xe2\x80\x99 hour\r\ntogether, before he\xe2\x80\x99d fly at a real gentlewoman like you. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful how he knows which is the good-looking ladies; and\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npartic\xe2\x80\x99lar fond of \xe2\x80\x99em when they\xe2\x80\x99ve good shapes. Lors!\xe2\x80\x9d added Bob,\r\nlaying down his pack on the gravel, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand pities such a lady\r\nas you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with a packman, i\xe2\x80\x99 stead o\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 into these\r\nnewfangled shops, where there\xe2\x80\x99s half-a-dozen fine gents wi\xe2\x80\x99 their chins\r\npropped up wi\xe2\x80\x99 a stiff stock, a-looking like bottles wi\xe2\x80\x99 ornamental\r\nstoppers, an\xe2\x80\x99 all got to get their dinner out of a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 calico; it\r\nstan\xe2\x80\x99s to reason you must pay three times the price you pay a packman,\r\nas is the nat\xe2\x80\x99ral way o\xe2\x80\x99 gettin\xe2\x80\x99 goods,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 pays no rent, an\xe2\x80\x99 isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him,\r\nwhether he will or no. But lors! mum, you know what it is better nor I\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x94_you_ can see through them shopmen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Glegg,\r\nintending to imply that Bob\xe2\x80\x99s flattery had produced no effect on _her;_\r\nwhile her husband, standing behind her with his hands in his pockets\r\nand legs apart, winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the\r\nprobability of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s being circumvented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, to be sure, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must ha\xe2\x80\x99 dealt wi\xe2\x80\x99 no end o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npackmen when you war a young lass\xe2\x80\x94before the master here had the luck\r\nto set eyes on you. I know where you lived, I do,\xe2\x80\x94seen th\xe2\x80\x99 house many a\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x94close upon Squire Darleigh\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94a stone house wi\xe2\x80\x99 steps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that it had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, pouring out the tea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nsomething o\xe2\x80\x99 my family, then? Are you akin to that packman with a\r\nsquint in his eye, as used to bring th\xe2\x80\x99 Irish linen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you there now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I know as you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nremember the best bargains you\xe2\x80\x99ve made in your life was made wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\npackmen? Why, you see even a squintin\xe2\x80\x99 packman\xe2\x80\x99s better nor a shopman\r\nas can see straight. Lors! if I\xe2\x80\x99d had the luck to call at the stone\r\nhouse wi\xe2\x80\x99 my pack, as lies here,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94stooping and thumping the bundle\r\nemphatically with his fist,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 handsome young lasses all stannin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nout on the stone steps, it ud\xe2\x80\x99 ha\xe2\x80\x99 been summat like openin\xe2\x80\x99 a pack,\r\nthat would. It\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y the poor houses now as a packman calls on, if it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t for the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 the sarvant-maids. They\xe2\x80\x99re paltry times, these\r\nare. Why, mum, look at the printed cottons now, an\xe2\x80\x99 what they was when\r\nyou wore \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94why, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put such a thing on now, I can see. It\r\nmust be first-rate quality, the manifactur as you\xe2\x80\x99d buy,\xe2\x80\x94summat as \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nwear as well as your own faitures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, better quality nor any you\xe2\x80\x99re like to carry; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\r\nfirst-rate but brazenness, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, with a\r\ntriumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg, are you\r\ngoing ever to sit down to your tea? Tom, there\xe2\x80\x99s a cup for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak true there, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cMy pack isn\xe2\x80\x99t for ladies like\r\nyou. The time\xe2\x80\x99s gone by for that. Bargains picked up dirt cheap! A bit\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 damage here an\xe2\x80\x99 there, as can be cut out, or else niver seen i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nwearin\xe2\x80\x99, but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings as nobody sees. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man as \xe2\x80\x99ud offer t\xe2\x80\x99 open my pack to\r\n_you_, mum; no, no; I\xe2\x80\x99m a imperent chap, as you say,\xe2\x80\x94these times makes\r\nfolks imperent,\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m not up to the mark o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what goods do you carry in your pack?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine-coloured things, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x94shawls an\xe2\x80\x99 that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts, mum, all sorts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob,\xe2\x80\x94thumping his bundle; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us\r\nsay no more about that, if _you_ please. I\xe2\x80\x99m here upo\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man to take up the time wi\xe2\x80\x99 my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, what _is_ this business as is to be kept from me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nGlegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the\r\none-half wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little plan o\xe2\x80\x99 nephey Tom\xe2\x80\x99s here,\xe2\x80\x9d said good-natured Mr Glegg; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nnot altogether a bad \xe2\x80\x99un, I think. A little plan for making money;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the right sort o\xe2\x80\x99 plan for young folks as have got their fortin\r\nto make, eh, Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a plan where he expects iverything to be done for\r\nhim by his friends; that\xe2\x80\x99s what the young folks think of mostly\r\nnowadays. And pray, what has this packman got to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 what goes on in\r\nour family? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak for yourself, Tom, and let your aunt know\r\nthings, as a nephey should?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Bob Jakin, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, bridling the irritation that aunt\r\nGlegg\xe2\x80\x99s voice always produced. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known him ever since we were\r\nlittle boys. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very good fellow, and always ready to do me a\r\nkindness. And he has had some experience in sending goods out,\xe2\x80\x94a small\r\npart of a cargo as a private speculation; and he thinks if I could\r\nbegin to do a little in the same way, I might make some money. A large\r\ninterest is got in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge int\xe2\x80\x99rest?\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Glegg, with eagerness; \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you\r\ncall large int\xe2\x80\x99rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen or twelve per cent, Bob says, after expenses are paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I let to know o\xe2\x80\x99 such things before, Mr Glegg?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Glegg, turning to her husband, with a deep grating tone of\r\nreproach. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you allays told me as there was no getting more nor\r\nfive per cent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ninto trade, could you? You can\xe2\x80\x99t get more than five per cent with\r\nsecurity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can turn a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 money for you, an\xe2\x80\x99 welcome, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99d like to risk it,\xe2\x80\x94not as there\xe2\x80\x99s any risk to speak on. But if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d a mind to lend a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 money to Mr Tom, he\xe2\x80\x99d pay you six or\r\nseven per zent, an\xe2\x80\x99 get a trifle for himself as well; an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\ngood-natur\xe2\x80\x99d lady like you \xe2\x80\x99ud like the feel o\xe2\x80\x99 the money better if\r\nyour nephey took part on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, Mrs G.?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade a bit more inquiry, as I shall perhaps start Tom here with a bit\r\nof a nest-egg,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay me int\xe2\x80\x99rest, you know,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some\r\nlittle sums lyin\xe2\x80\x99 idle twisted up in a stockin\xe2\x80\x99 toe, or that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg, it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond iverything! You\xe2\x80\x99ll go and give information to\r\nthe tramps next, as they may come and rob me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, as I was sayin\xe2\x80\x99, if you like to join me wi\xe2\x80\x99 twenty pounds,\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it fifty. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be a pretty good nest-egg, eh,\r\nTom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not counting on me, Mr Glegg, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncould do fine things wi\xe2\x80\x99 my money, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, rather snappishly, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll do without\r\nyou. I shall go with you to see this Salt,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, I suppose, you\xe2\x80\x99ll go all the other way, Mr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nG., \xe2\x80\x9cand want to shut me out o\xe2\x80\x99 my own nephey\xe2\x80\x99s business. I never said\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put money into it,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t say as it shall be twenty pounds,\r\nthough you\xe2\x80\x99re so ready to say it for me,\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99ll see some day as his\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s in the right not to risk the money she\xe2\x80\x99s saved for him till it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproved as it won\xe2\x80\x99t be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant sort o\xe2\x80\x99risk, that is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg,\r\nindiscreetly winking at Tom, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t avoid smiling. But Bob\r\nstemmed the injured lady\xe2\x80\x99s outburst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d he said admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x94you do. An\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing but fair. _You_ see how the first bit of a job answers, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99ll come down handsome. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing to hev good\r\nkin. I got my bit of a nest-egg, as the master calls it, all by my own\r\nsharpness,\xe2\x80\x94ten suvreigns it was,\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 dousing the fire at Torry\xe2\x80\x99s mill,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s growed an\xe2\x80\x99 growed by a bit an\xe2\x80\x99 a bit, till I\xe2\x80\x99n got a matter o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthirty pound to lay out, besides makin\xe2\x80\x99 my mother comfor\xe2\x80\x99ble. I should\r\nget more, on\xe2\x80\x99y I\xe2\x80\x99m such a soft wi\xe2\x80\x99 the women,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t help lettin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nhev such good bargains. There\xe2\x80\x99s this bundle, now,\xe2\x80\x9d thumping it lustily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cany other chap \xe2\x80\x99ud make a pretty penny out on it. But me!\xe2\x80\x94lors, I\r\nshall sell \xe2\x80\x99em for pretty near what I paid for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got a bit of good net, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, in a patronizing\r\ntone, moving from the tea-table, and folding her napkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mum, not what you\xe2\x80\x99d think it worth your while to look at. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nscorn to show it you. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be an insult to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, still patronizing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndamaged goods, they\xe2\x80\x99re like enough to be a bit the better quality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mum, I know my place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, lifting up his pack and\r\nshouldering it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going t\xe2\x80\x99 expose the lowness o\xe2\x80\x99 my trade to a\r\nlady like you. Packs is come down i\xe2\x80\x99 the world; it \xe2\x80\x99ud cut you to th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheart to see the difference. I\xe2\x80\x99m at your sarvice, sir, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nmind to go and see Salt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, really unwilling to cut short the\r\ndialogue. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you wanted at the wharf, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; I left Stowe in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, put down your pack, and let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, drawing a\r\nchair to the window and seating herself with much dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ask it, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake no more words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cbut do as I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh mum, I\xe2\x80\x99m loth, that I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, slowly depositing his pack on\r\nthe step, and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\r\nyou order shall be done\xe2\x80\x9d (much fumbling in pauses between the\r\nsentences). \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as you\xe2\x80\x99ll buy a single thing on me,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry\r\nfor you to do it,\xe2\x80\x94for think o\xe2\x80\x99 them poor women up i\xe2\x80\x99 the villages\r\nthere, as niver stir a hundred yards from home,\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a pity for\r\nanybody to buy up their bargains. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a junketing to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em when they see me wi\xe2\x80\x99 my pack, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shall niver pick up such\r\nbargains for \xe2\x80\x99em again. Least ways, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no time now, for I\xe2\x80\x99m off to\r\nLaceham. See here now,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob went on, becoming rapid again, and holding\r\nup a scarlet woollen Kerchief with an embroidered wreath in the corner;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a thing to make a lass\xe2\x80\x99s mouth water, an\xe2\x80\x99 on\xe2\x80\x99y two shillin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhy? Why, \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a moth-hole \xe2\x80\x99i this plain end. Lors,\r\nI think the moths an\xe2\x80\x99 the mildew was sent by Providence o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to\r\ncheapen the goods a bit for the good-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 women as han\xe2\x80\x99t got much\r\nmoney. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the moths, now, every hankicher on \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 gone to the rich, handsome ladies, like you, mum, at five shillin\xe2\x80\x99\r\napiece,\xe2\x80\x94not a farthin\xe2\x80\x99 less; but what does the moth do? Why, it nibbles\r\noff three shillin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the price i\xe2\x80\x99 no time; an\xe2\x80\x99 then a packman like me\r\ncan carry \xe2\x80\x99t to the poor lasses as live under the dark thack, to make a\r\nbit of a blaze for \xe2\x80\x99em. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a fire, to look at such a\r\nhankicher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob held it at a distance for admiration, but Mrs Glegg said sharply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but nobody wants a fire this time o\xe2\x80\x99 year. Put these coloured\r\nthings by; let me look at your nets, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mum, I told you how it \xe2\x80\x99ud be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, flinging aside the\r\ncoloured things with an air of desperation. \xe2\x80\x9cI knowed it ud\xe2\x80\x99 turn\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99 you to look at such paltry articles as I carry. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a piece\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 figured muslin now, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 you lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at it? You might\r\nas well look at poor folks\xe2\x80\x99s victual, mum; it \xe2\x80\x99ud on\xe2\x80\x99y take away your\r\nappetite. There\xe2\x80\x99s a yard i\xe2\x80\x99 the middle on\xe2\x80\x99t as the pattern\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nmissed,\xe2\x80\x94lors, why, it\xe2\x80\x99s a muslin as the Princess Victoree might ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwore; but,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bob, flinging it behind him on to the turf, as if to\r\nsave Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll be bought up by the huckster\xe2\x80\x99s wife at\r\nFibb\xe2\x80\x99s End,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where _it\xe2\x80\x99ll_ go\xe2\x80\x94ten shillin\xe2\x80\x99 for the whole lot\xe2\x80\x94ten\r\nyards, countin\xe2\x80\x99 the damaged un\xe2\x80\x94five-an\xe2\x80\x99-twenty shillin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nthe price, not a penny less. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more, mum; it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to\r\nyou, a piece o\xe2\x80\x99 muslin like that; you can afford to pay three times the\r\nmoney for a thing as isn\xe2\x80\x99t half so good. It\xe2\x80\x99s nets _you_ talked on;\r\nwell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a piece as \xe2\x80\x99ull serve you to make fun on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me that muslin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a buff; I\xe2\x80\x99m partial to\r\nbuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, but a _damaged_ thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, in a tone of deprecating\r\ndisgust. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d do nothing with it, mum, you\xe2\x80\x99d give it to the cook, I\r\nknow you would, an\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a pity,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d look too much like a lady\r\nin it; it\xe2\x80\x99s unbecoming for servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch it, and let me see you measure it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg,\r\nauthoritatively.\r\n\r\nBob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what there is over measure!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding forth the extra\r\nhalf-yard, while Mrs Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard, and\r\nthrowing her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a\r\ndistant view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you six shilling for it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, throwing it down with\r\nthe air of a person who mentions an ultimatum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you now, mum, as it \xe2\x80\x99ud hurt your feelings to look at my\r\npack? That damaged bit\xe2\x80\x99s turned your stomach now; I see it has,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBob, wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness, and apparently\r\nabout to fasten up his pack. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re used to seein\xe2\x80\x99 a different sort o\xe2\x80\x99\r\narticle carried by packmen, when you lived at the stone house. Packs is\r\ncome down i\xe2\x80\x99 the world; I told you that; _my_ goods are for common\r\nfolks. Mrs Pepper \xe2\x80\x99ull give me ten shillin\xe2\x80\x99 for that muslin, an\xe2\x80\x99 be\r\nsorry as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her more. Such articles answer i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nwearin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94they keep their colour till the threads melt away i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nwash-tub, an\xe2\x80\x99 that won\xe2\x80\x99t be while _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ a young un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, seven shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it out o\xe2\x80\x99 your mind, mum, now do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 net,\r\nthen, for you to look at before I tie up my pack, just for you to see\r\nwhat my trade\xe2\x80\x99s come to,\xe2\x80\x94spotted and sprigged, you see, beautiful but\r\nyallow,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s been lyin\xe2\x80\x99 by an\xe2\x80\x99 got the wrong colour. I could niver ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbought such net, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been yallow. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s took me a deal o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstudy to know the vally o\xe2\x80\x99 such articles; when I begun to carry a pack,\r\nI was as ignirant as a pig; net or calico was all the same to me. I\r\nthought them things the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in\r\ndreadful, for I\xe2\x80\x99m a straightforrard chap,\xe2\x80\x94up to no tricks, mum. I can\r\nonly say my nose is my own, for if I went beyond, I should lose myself\r\npretty quick. An\xe2\x80\x99 I gev five-an\xe2\x80\x99-eightpence for that piece o\xe2\x80\x99 net,\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\nwas to tell y\xe2\x80\x99 anything else I should be tellin\xe2\x80\x99 you fibs,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfive-an\xe2\x80\x99-eightpence I shall ask of it, not a penny more, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s article, an\xe2\x80\x99 I like to \xe2\x80\x99commodate the women.\r\nFive-an\xe2\x80\x99-eightpence for six yards,\xe2\x80\x94as cheap as if it was only the dirt\r\non it as was paid for.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind having three yards of it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s but six altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, mum, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth\r\nyour while; you can go to the shop to-morrow an\xe2\x80\x99 get the same pattern\r\nready whitened. It\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y three times the money; what\xe2\x80\x99s that to a lady\r\nlike you?\xe2\x80\x9d He gave an emphatic tie to his bundle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, lay me out that muslin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s eight shilling\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ be jokin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, looking up with a laughing face; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x99d you was a pleasant lady when I fust come to the winder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, put it me out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I let you have it for ten shillin\xe2\x80\x99, mum, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as\r\nnot tell nobody. I should be a laughin\xe2\x80\x99-stock; the trade \xe2\x80\x99ud hoot me,\r\nif they knowed it. I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to make believe as I ask more nor I do\r\nfor my goods, else they\xe2\x80\x99d find out I was a flat. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninsist upo\xe2\x80\x99 buyin\xe2\x80\x99 the net, for then I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 lost my two best\r\nbargains for Mrs Pepper o\xe2\x80\x99 Fibb\xe2\x80\x99s End, an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s a rare customer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me look at the net again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, yearning after the\r\ncheap spots and sprigs, now they were vanishing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny _you_, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob handing it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!, see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the sort\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 article I\xe2\x80\x99m recommendin\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Tom to send out. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing\r\nfor anybody as has got a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 money; these Laceham goods \xe2\x80\x99ud make it\r\nbreed like maggits. If I was a lady wi\xe2\x80\x99 a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 money!\xe2\x80\x94why, I know one\r\nas put thirty pounds into them goods,\xe2\x80\x94a lady wi\xe2\x80\x99 a cork leg, but as\r\nsharp,\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch _her_ runnin\xe2\x80\x99 her head into a sack; _she\xe2\x80\x99d_\r\nsee her way clear out o\xe2\x80\x99 anything afore she\xe2\x80\x99d be in a hurry to start.\r\nWell, she let out thirty pound to a young man in the drapering line,\r\nand he laid it out i\xe2\x80\x99 Laceham goods, an\xe2\x80\x99 a shupercargo o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nacquinetance (not Salt) took \xe2\x80\x99em out, an\xe2\x80\x99 she got her eight per zent\r\nfust go off; an\xe2\x80\x99 now you can\xe2\x80\x99t hold her but she must be sendin\xe2\x80\x99 out\r\ncarguies wi\xe2\x80\x99 every ship, till she\xe2\x80\x99s gettin\xe2\x80\x99 as rich as a Jew. Bucks her\r\nname is, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live i\xe2\x80\x99 this town. Now then, mum, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll please\r\nto give me the net\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen shilling, then, for the two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na shameful price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, mum, you\xe2\x80\x99ll niver say that when you\xe2\x80\x99re upo\xe2\x80\x99 your knees i\xe2\x80\x99 church\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 five years\xe2\x80\x99 time. I\xe2\x80\x99m makin\xe2\x80\x99 you a present o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 articles; I am,\r\nindeed. That eightpence shaves off my profits as clean as a razor. Now\r\nthen, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bob, shouldering his pack, \xe2\x80\x9cif you please, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe glad to go and see about makin\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Tom\xe2\x80\x99s fortin. Eh, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d got\r\nanother twenty pound to lay out _my_sen; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay to say my\r\nCatechism afore I knowed what to do wi\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit, Mr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, as her husband took his hat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou never _will_ give me the chance o\xe2\x80\x99 speaking. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go away now,\r\nand finish everything about this business, and come back and tell me\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too late for me to speak. As if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my nephey\xe2\x80\x99s own aunt, and\r\nthe head o\xe2\x80\x99 the family on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side! and laid by guineas, all\r\nfull weight, for him, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll know who to respect when I\xe2\x80\x99m laid in my\r\ncoffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs G., say what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr G., hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say as I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t venture twenty pounds, if you make out as\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s right and safe. And if I do, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Mrs Glegg,\r\nturning impressively to her nephew, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll allays bear it in\r\nmind and be grateful for such an aunt. I mean you to pay me interest,\r\nyou know; I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve o\xe2\x80\x99 giving; we niver looked for that in _my_\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, rather proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer having the money\r\nonly lent to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; that\xe2\x80\x99s the Dodson sperrit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, rising to get\r\nher knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be\r\nbathos.\r\n\r\nSalt\xe2\x80\x94that eminently \xe2\x80\x9cbriny chap\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94having been discovered in a cloud of\r\ntobacco-smoke at the Anchor Tavern, Mr Glegg commenced inquiries which\r\nturned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnest-egg,\xe2\x80\x9d to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in this\r\nmodest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise\r\nsurprise you; namely, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s accumulation of a fund, unknown to his\r\nfather, that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy\r\nprocess of saving, and quite cover the deficit. When once his attention\r\nhad been turned to this source of gain, Tom determined to make the most\r\nof it, and lost no opportunity of obtaining information and extending\r\nhis small enterprises. In not telling his father, he was influenced by\r\nthat strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth\r\nto those who blame an action and those who admire it,\xe2\x80\x94partly, it was\r\nthat disinclination to confidence which is seen between near kindred,\r\nthat family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations of our\r\nlives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father with a great\r\njoy. He did not see that it would have been better to soothe the\r\ninterval with a new hope, and prevent the delirium of a too sudden\r\nelation.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s first meeting with Philip, Tom had already\r\nnearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital; and while they\r\nwere walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps, he, by the same\r\nevening light, was riding into Laceham, proud of being on his first\r\njourney on behalf of Guest & Co., and revolving in his mind all the\r\nchances that by the end of another year he should have doubled his\r\ngains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his father\xe2\x80\x99s name, and\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94for he should be twenty-one\xe2\x80\x94have got a new start for himself,\r\non a higher platform of employment. Did he not desire it? He was quite\r\nsure that he did.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nThe Wavering Balance\r\n\r\nI said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a\r\nmental conflict already begun. You have seen clearly enough, in her\r\ninterview with Philip, what that conflict was. Here suddenly was an\r\nopening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of\r\nhumiliation, where all her prospect was the remote, unfathomed sky; and\r\nsome of the memory-haunting earthly delights were no longer out of her\r\nreach. She might have books, converse, affection; she might hear\r\ntidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense of\r\nexile; and it would be a kindness to Philip too, who was\r\npitiable,\xe2\x80\x94clearly not happy. And perhaps here was an opportunity\r\nindicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service;\r\nperhaps the noblest, completest devoutness could hardly exist without\r\nsome width of knowledge; _must_ she always live in this resigned\r\nimprisonment? It was so blameless, so good a thing that there should be\r\nfriendship between her and Philip; the motives that forbade it were so\r\nunreasonable, so unchristian! But the severe monotonous warning came\r\nagain and again,\xe2\x80\x94that she was losing the simplicity and clearness of\r\nher life by admitting a ground of concealment; and that, by forsaking\r\nthe simple rule of renunciation, she was throwing herself under the\r\nseductive guidance of illimitable wants. She thought she had won\r\nstrength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the next week\r\nto turn her steps in the evening to the Red Deeps. But while she was\r\nresolved to say an affectionate farewell to Philip, how she looked\r\nforward to that evening walk in the still, fleckered shade of the\r\nhollows, away from all that was harsh and unlovely; to the\r\naffectionate, admiring looks that would meet her; to the sense of\r\ncomradeship that childish memories would give to wiser, older talk; to\r\nthe certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she said, which\r\nno one else cared for! It was a half-hour that it would be very hard to\r\nturn her back upon, with the sense that there would be no other like\r\nit. Yet she said what she meant to say; she looked firm as well as sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, I have made up my mind; it is right that we should give each\r\nother up, in everything but memory. I could not see you without\r\nconcealment\xe2\x80\x94stay, I know what you are going to say,\xe2\x80\x94it is other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s wrong feelings that make concealment necessary; but\r\nconcealment is bad, however it may be caused. I feel that it would be\r\nbad for me, for us both. And then, if our secret were discovered, there\r\nwould be nothing but misery,\xe2\x80\x94dreadful anger; and then we must part\r\nafter all, and it would be harder, when we were used to seeing each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s face had flushed, and there was a momentary eagerness of\r\nexpression, as if he had been about to resist this decision with all\r\nhis might.\r\n\r\nBut he controlled himself, and said, with assumed calmness: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nMaggie, if we must part, let us try and forget it for one half hour;\r\nlet us talk together a little while, for the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it; his\r\nquietness made her all the more sure she had given him great pain, and\r\nshe wanted to show him how unwillingly she had given it. They walked\r\ntogether hand in hand in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit down in the hollow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we stood the last\r\ntime. See how the dog-roses have strewed the ground, and spread their\r\nopal petals over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down at the roots of the slanting ash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, \xe2\x80\x9cso you must let me study your face a little, while you\r\nstay,\xe2\x80\x94since I am not to see it again. Please turn your head this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was said in an entreating voice, and it would have been very hard\r\nof Maggie to refuse. The full, lustrous face, with the bright black\r\ncoronet, looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be\r\nworshipped, on the pale-hued, small-featured face that was turned up to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be sitting for my second portrait then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be larger than the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You will look like a tall\r\nHamadryad, dark and strong and noble, just issued from one of the\r\nfir-trees, when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the\r\ngrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to think more of painting than of anything now, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, rather sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think of too many\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x94sow all sorts of seeds, and get no great harvest from any one\r\nof them. I\xe2\x80\x99m cursed with susceptibility in every direction, and\r\neffective faculty in none. I care for painting and music; I care for\r\nclassic literature, and medi\xc3\xa6val literature, and modern literature; I\r\nflutter all ways, and fly in none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes,\xe2\x80\x94to enjoy so\r\nmany beautiful things, when they are within your reach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nmusingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to\r\nhave one sort of talent,\xe2\x80\x94almost like a carrier-pigeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other men,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI might get some power and distinction by mere\r\nmediocrity, as they do; at least I should get those middling\r\nsatisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones. I\r\nmight think society at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s agreeable then. But nothing could make\r\nlife worth the purchase-money of pain to me, but some faculty that\r\nwould lift me above the dead level of provincial existence. Yes, there\r\nis one thing,\xe2\x80\x94a passion answers as well as a faculty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie did not hear the last words; she was struggling against the\r\nconsciousness that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s words had set her own discontent vibrating\r\nagain as it used to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I know so much less\r\nthan you do. I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on\r\nbeing the same every day, and I must always be doing things of no\r\nconsequence, and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I think\r\nwe are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of.\r\nIs it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied\r\nus? I have found great peace in that for the last two or three years,\r\neven joy in subduing my own will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, vehemently; \xe2\x80\x9cand you are shutting yourself\r\nup in a narrow, self-delusive fanaticism, which is only a way of\r\nescaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your\r\nnature. Joy and peace are not resignation; resignation is the willing\r\nendurance of a pain that is not allayed, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be\r\nallayed. Stupefaction is not resignation; and it is stupefaction to\r\nremain in ignorance,\xe2\x80\x94to shut up all the avenues by which the life of\r\nyour fellow-men might become known to you. I am not resigned; I am not\r\nsure that life is long enough to learn that lesson. _You_ are not\r\nresigned; you are only trying to stupefy yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s lips trembled; she felt there was some truth in what Philip\r\nsaid, and yet there was a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate\r\napplication it had to her conduct, it was no better than falsity. Her\r\ndouble impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker.\r\nPhilip seriously believed what he said, but he said it with vehemence\r\nbecause it made an argument against the resolution that opposed his\r\nwishes. But Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, made more childlike by the gathering tears,\r\ntouched him with a tenderer, less egotistic feeling. He took her hand\r\nand said gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us think of such things in this short half-hour, Maggie. Let\r\nus only care about being together. We shall be friends in spite of\r\nseparation. We shall always think of each other. I shall be glad to\r\nlive as long as you are alive, because I shall think there may always\r\ncome a time when I can\xe2\x80\x94when you will let me help you in some way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dear, good brother you would have been, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nsmiling through the haze of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you would have made as much\r\nfuss about me, and been as pleased for me to love you, as would have\r\nsatisfied even me. You would have loved me well enough to bear with me,\r\nand forgive me everything. That was what I always longed that Tom\r\nshould do. I was never satisfied with a _little_ of anything. That is\r\nwhy it is better for me to do without earthly happiness altogether. I\r\nnever felt that I had enough music,\xe2\x80\x94I wanted more instruments playing\r\ntogether; I wanted voices to be fuller and deeper. Do you ever sing\r\nnow, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d she added abruptly, as if she had forgotten what went\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cevery day, almost. But my voice is only middling, like\r\neverything else in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sing me something,\xe2\x80\x94just one song. I _may_ listen to that before I\r\ngo,\xe2\x80\x94something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon, when\r\nwe had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and I put my apron over my\r\nhead to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip; and Maggie buried her face in her hands while\r\nhe sang _sotto voce_, \xe2\x80\x9cLove in her eyes sits playing,\xe2\x80\x9d and then said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will only haunt\r\nme. Let us walk, Philip. I must go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved away, so that he was obliged to rise and follow her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t persist in this\r\nwilful, senseless privation. It makes me wretched to see you benumbing\r\nand cramping your nature in this way. You were so full of life when you\r\nwere a child; I thought you would be a brilliant woman,\xe2\x80\x94all wit and\r\nbright imagination. And it flashes out in your face still, until you\r\ndraw that veil of dull quiescence over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you speak so bitterly to me, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I foresee it will not end well; you can never carry on this\r\nself-torture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have strength given me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you will not, Maggie; no one has strength given to do what is\r\nunnatural. It is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations. No\r\ncharacter becomes strong in that way. You will be thrown into the world\r\nsome day, and then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you\r\ndeny now will assault you like a savage appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie started and paused, looking at Philip with alarm in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, how dare you shake me in this way? You are a tempter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not; but love gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives\r\nforeboding. _Listen_ to me,\xe2\x80\x94let _me_ supply you with books; do let me\r\nsee you sometimes,\xe2\x80\x94be your brother and teacher, as you said at Lorton.\r\nIt is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be\r\ncommitting this long suicide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie felt unable to speak. She shook her head and walked on in\r\nsilence, till they came to the end of the Scotch firs, and she put out\r\nher hand in sign of parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you banish me from this place forever, then, Maggie? Surely I may\r\ncome and walk in it sometimes? If I meet you by chance, there is no\r\nconcealment in that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is the moment when our resolution seems about to become\r\nirrevocable\xe2\x80\x94when the fatal iron gates are about to close upon us\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ntests our strength. Then, after hours of clear reasoning and firm\r\nconviction, we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long\r\nstruggles, and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory.\r\n\r\nMaggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, and there\r\npassed over her face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies\r\nany relief. He saw it, and they parted in silence.\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be\r\nvisited with glancing fears lest he had been intervening too\r\npresumptuously in the action of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s conscience, perhaps for a\r\nselfish end. But no!\xe2\x80\x94he persuaded himself his end was not selfish. He\r\nhad little hope that Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had\r\nfor her; and it must be better for Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s future life, when these\r\npetty family obstacles to her freedom had disappeared, that the present\r\nshould not be entirely sacrificed, and that she should have some\r\nopportunity of culture,\xe2\x80\x94some interchange with a mind above the vulgar\r\nlevel of those she was now condemned to live with. If we only look far\r\nenough off for the consequence of our actions, we can always find some\r\npoint in the combination of results by which those actions can be\r\njustified; by adopting the point of view of a Providence who arranges\r\nresults, or of a philosopher who traces them, we shall find it possible\r\nto obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable\r\nto us in the present moment. And it was in this way that Philip\r\njustified his subtle efforts to overcome Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s true prompting\r\nagainst a concealment that would introduce doubleness into her own\r\nmind, and might cause new misery to those who had the primary natural\r\nclaim on her. But there was a surplus of passion in him that made him\r\nhalf independent of justifying motives. His longing to see Maggie, and\r\nmake an element in her life, had in it some of that savage impulse to\r\nsnatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the mental and\r\nbodily constitution have made pain predominate. He had not his full\r\nshare in the common good of men; he could not even pass muster with the\r\ninsignificant, but must be singled out for pity, and excepted from what\r\nwas a matter of course with others. Even to Maggie he was an exception;\r\nit was clear that the thought of his being her lover had never entered\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nDo not think too hardly of Philip. Ugly and deformed people have great\r\nneed of unusual virtues, because they are likely to be extremely\r\nuncomfortable without them; but the theory that unusual virtues spring\r\nby a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages, as animals get\r\nthicker wool in severe climates, is perhaps a little overstrained. The\r\ntemptations of beauty are much dwelt upon, but I fancy they only bear\r\nthe same relation to those of ugliness, as the temptation to excess at\r\na feast, where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as\r\npalate, bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of hunger.\r\nDoes not the Hunger Tower stand as the type of the utmost trial to what\r\nis human in us?\r\n\r\nPhilip had never been soothed by that mother\xe2\x80\x99s love which flows out to\r\nus in the greater abundance because our need is greater, which clings\r\nto us the more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners in\r\nthe game of life; and the sense of his father\xe2\x80\x99s affection and\r\nindulgence toward him was marred by the keener perception of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s faults. Kept aloof from all practical life as Philip had been,\r\nand by nature half feminine in sensitiveness, he had some of the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate\r\npursuit of sensual enjoyment; and this one strong natural tie in his\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x94his relation as a son,\xe2\x80\x94was like an aching limb to him. Perhaps\r\nthere is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any way\r\nunfavourably excepted from ordinary conditions, until the good force\r\nhas had time to triumph; and it has rarely had time for that at\r\ntwo-and-twenty. That force was present in Philip in much strength, but\r\nthe sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nAnother Love-Scene\r\n\r\nEarly in the following April, nearly a year after that dubious parting\r\nyou have just witnessed, you may, if you like, again see Maggie\r\nentering the Red Deeps through the group of Scotch firs. But it is\r\nearly afternoon and not evening, and the edge of sharpness in the\r\nspring air makes her draw her large shawl close about her and trip\r\nalong rather quickly; though she looks round, as usual, that she may\r\ntake in the sight of her beloved trees. There is a more eager,\r\ninquiring look in her eyes than there was last June, and a smile is\r\nhovering about her lips, as if some playful speech were awaiting the\r\nright hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake back your _Corinne_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, drawing a book from under her\r\nshawl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were right in telling me she would do me no good; but you\r\nwere wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the\r\nclouds that promises us a bright heaven once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Muses were uncomfortable\r\ngoddesses, I think,\xe2\x80\x94obliged always to carry rolls and musical\r\ninstruments about with them. If I carried a harp in this climate, you\r\nknow, I must have a green baize cover for it; and I should be sure to\r\nleave it behind me by mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou agree with me in not liking Corinne, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish the book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I came to the\r\nblond-haired young lady reading in the park, I shut it up, and\r\ndetermined to read no further. I foresaw that that light-complexioned\r\ngirl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m determined to read no more books where the blond-haired women carry\r\naway all the happiness. I should begin to have a prejudice against\r\nthem. If you could give me some story, now, where the dark woman\r\ntriumphs, it would restore the balance. I want to avenge Rebecca and\r\nFlora MacIvor and Minna, and all the rest of the dark unhappy ones.\r\nSince you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices;\r\nyou are always arguing against prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and\r\ncarry away all the love from your cousin Lucy. She is sure to have some\r\nhandsome young man of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s at her feet now; and you have only to\r\nshine upon him\xe2\x80\x94your fair little cousin will be quite quenched in your\r\nbeams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, that is not pretty of you, to apply my nonsense to anything\r\nreal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking hurt. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I, with my old gowns and want\r\nof all accomplishments, could be a rival of dear little Lucy,\xe2\x80\x94who knows\r\nand does all sorts of charming things, and is ten times prettier than I\r\nam,\xe2\x80\x94even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival.\r\nBesides, I never go to aunt Deane\xe2\x80\x99s when any one is there; it is only\r\nbecause dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that she comes to see me, and\r\nwill have me go to see her sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not like you to take\r\nplayfulness literally. You must have been in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s this morning, and\r\nbrought away a slight infection of dulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cif you meant that for a joke, it was a\r\npoor one; but I thought it was a very good reproof. I thought you\r\nwanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every one to admire me\r\nmost. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for that that I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous for the dark women,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m dark myself; it\xe2\x80\x99s because I always care the most about the\r\nunhappy people. If the blond girl were forsaken, I should like _her_\r\nbest. I always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you would never have the heart to reject one yourself, should\r\nyou, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, flushing a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with a bright smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink perhaps I could if he were very conceited; and yet, if he got\r\nextremely humiliated afterward, I should relent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often wondered, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip said, with some effort, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be more likely to love a man that other women were\r\nnot likely to love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would depend on what they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might be very disagreeable. He might look at me through\r\nan eye-glass stuck in his eye, making a hideous face, as young Torry\r\ndoes. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never felt\r\nany pity for young Torry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never any pity for conceited people,\r\nbecause I think they carry their comfort about with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94suppose it was a man who was not conceited, who\r\nfelt he had nothing to be conceited about; who had been marked from\r\nchildhood for a peculiar kind of suffering, and to whom you were the\r\nday-star of his life; who loved you, worshipped you, so entirely that\r\nhe felt it happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at\r\nrare moments\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short\r\nthis very happiness,\xe2\x80\x94a pang of the same dread that had kept his love\r\nmute through long months. A rush of self-consciousness told him that he\r\nwas besotted to have said all this. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s manner this morning had\r\nbeen as unconstrained and indifferent as ever.\r\n\r\nBut she was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual\r\nemotion in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s tone, she had turned quickly to look at him; and as\r\nhe went on speaking, a great change came over her face,\xe2\x80\x94a flush and\r\nslight spasm of the features, such as we see in people who hear some\r\nnews that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past.\r\nShe was quite silent, and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree,\r\nshe sat down, as if she had no strength to spare for her muscles. She\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, getting more and more alarmed in every fresh\r\nmoment of silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a fool to say it; forget that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it. I\r\nshall be contented if things can be as they were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distress with which he spoke urged Maggie to say something. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nso surprised, Philip; I had not thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d And the effort to say\r\nthis brought the tears down too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it made you hate me, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m a presumptuous fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you think I have such feelings? As\r\nif I were not grateful for _any_ love. But\xe2\x80\x94but I had never thought of\r\nyour being my lover. It seemed so far off\xe2\x80\x94like a dream\xe2\x80\x94only like one of\r\nthe stories one imagines\xe2\x80\x94that I should ever have a lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen can you bear to think of me as your lover, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\r\nseating himself by her, and taking her hand, in the elation of a sudden\r\nhope. \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie turned rather pale; this direct question seemed not easy to\r\nanswer. But her eyes met Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, which were in this moment liquid and\r\nbeautiful with beseeching love. She spoke with hesitation, yet with\r\nsweet, simple, girlish tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what\r\nI love you for.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a little while, and then added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\r\nwill be better for us not to say any more about it, won\xe2\x80\x99t it, dear\r\nPhilip? You know we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be friends, if our friendship were\r\ndiscovered. I have never felt that I was right in giving way about\r\nseeing you, though it has been so precious to me in some ways; and now\r\nthe fear comes upon me strongly again, that it will lead to evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no evil has come, Maggie; and if you had been guided by that fear\r\nbefore, you would only have lived through another dreary, benumbing\r\nyear, instead of reviving into your real self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been very sweet, I know,\xe2\x80\x94all the talking\r\ntogether, and the books, and the feeling that I had the walk to look\r\nforward to, when I could tell you the thoughts that had come into my\r\nhead while I was away from you. But it has made me restless; it has\r\nmade me think a great deal about the world; and I have impatient\r\nthoughts again,\xe2\x80\x94I get weary of my home; and then it cuts me to the\r\nheart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of my father and\r\nmother. I think what you call being benumbed was better\xe2\x80\x94better for\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94for then my selfish desires were benumbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve often told\r\nyou. What you call self-conquest\xe2\x80\x94blinding and deafening yourself to all\r\nbut one train of impressions\xe2\x80\x94is only the culture of monomania in a\r\nnature like yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken with some irritation, but now he sat down by her again\r\nand took her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If you\r\ncan really cling to me with all your heart, every obstacle will be\r\novercome in time; we need only wait. I can live on hope. Look at me,\r\nMaggie; tell me again it is possible for you to love me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\naway from me to that cloven tree; it is a bad omen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at\r\nLorton. You asked me if I should like you to kiss me,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x94and you promised to kiss me when you met me again. You never\r\nkept the promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to\r\nMaggie. It made the present moment less strange to her. She kissed him\r\nalmost as simply and quietly as she had done when she was twelve years\r\nold. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed with delight, but his next words were words\r\nof discontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem happy enough, Maggie; you are forcing yourself to say\r\nyou love me, out of pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, shaking her head, in her old childish way;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the truth. It is all new and strange to me; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I could love any one better than I love you. I should like\r\nalways to live with you\xe2\x80\x94to make you happy. I have always been happy\r\nwhen I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for\r\nyour sake; I will never do anything to wound my father. You must never\r\nask that from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maggie, I will ask nothing; I will bear everything; I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\nanother year only for a kiss, if you will only give me the first place\r\nin your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t make you wait so long as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut then, looking serious again, she added, as she rose from her seat,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite impossible\r\nwe can ever be more than friends,\xe2\x80\x94brother and sister in secret, as we\r\nhave been. Let us give up thinking of everything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maggie, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you up,\xe2\x80\x94unless you are deceiving me; unless\r\nyou really only care for me as if I were your brother. Tell me the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do, Philip. What happiness have I ever had so great as being\r\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x94since I was a little girl,\xe2\x80\x94the days Tom was good to me? And\r\nyour mind is a sort of world to me; you can tell me all I want to know.\r\nI think I should never be tired of being with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were walking hand in hand, looking at each other; Maggie, indeed,\r\nwas hurrying along, for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that\r\ntheir parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have\r\nunintentionally left some painful impression on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It was\r\none of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and\r\ndeceptive; when feeling, rising high above its average depth, leaves\r\nfloodmarks which are never reached again.\r\n\r\nThey stopped to part among the Scotch firs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my life will be filled with hope, Maggie, and I shall be happier\r\nthan other men, in spite of all? We _do_ belong to each other\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94whether we are apart or together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Philip; I should like never to part; I should like to make your\r\nlife very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for something else. I wonder whether it will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie smiled, with glistening tears, and then stooped her tall head to\r\nkiss the pale face that was full of pleading, timid love,\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe had a moment of real happiness then,\xe2\x80\x94a moment of belief that, if\r\nthere were sacrifice in this love, it was all the richer and more\r\nsatisfying.\r\n\r\nShe turned away and hurried home, feeling that in the hour since she\r\nhad trodden this road before, a new era had begun for her. The tissue\r\nof vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower, and all the threads\r\nof thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nThe Cloven Tree\r\n\r\nSecrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme\r\nour fear has sketched out. Fear is almost always haunted by terrible\r\ndramatic scenes, which recur in spite of the best-argued probabilities\r\nagainst them; and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of\r\nconcealment on her mind, the possibility of discovery had continually\r\npresented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her father or\r\nTom when she was walking with Philip in the Red Deeps. She was aware\r\nthat this was not one of the most likely events; but it was the scene\r\nthat most completely symbolised her inward dread. Those slight indirect\r\nsuggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and\r\nincalculable states of mind, are the favourite machinery of Fact, but\r\nare not the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work.\r\n\r\nCertainly one of the persons about whom Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s fears were furthest\r\nfrom troubling themselves was her aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that she\r\ndid not live in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and was neither sharp-eyed nor\r\nsharp-tempered, it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to\r\nfix rather than on aunt Glegg. And yet the channel of fatality\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npathway of the lightning\xe2\x80\x94was no other than aunt Pullet. She did not\r\nlive at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps, at\r\nthe end opposite that by which Maggie entered.\r\n\r\nThe day after Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on\r\nwhich Mr Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s church, Mrs Pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister\r\nGlegg, and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the one day\r\nin the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and today the\r\nbrighter spirits he had been in of late had flowed over in unusually\r\ncheerful open chat with his father, and in the invitation, \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nMagsie, you come too!\xe2\x80\x9d when he strolled out with his mother in the\r\ngarden to see the advancing cherry-blossoms. He had been better pleased\r\nwith Maggie since she had been less odd and ascetic; he was even\r\ngetting rather proud of her; several persons had remarked in his\r\nhearing that his sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was a\r\npeculiar brightness in her face, due in reality to an undercurrent of\r\nexcitement, which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it; but it\r\nmight pass for a sign of happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet, shaking her head\r\nsadly, as they sat round the tea-table. \xe2\x80\x9cI niver thought your girl \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe so good-looking, Bessy. But you must wear pink, my dear; that blue\r\nthing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower. Jane\r\nnever _was_ tasty. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you wear that gown o\xe2\x80\x99 mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so pretty and so smart, aunt. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too showy for me,\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast for my other clothes, that I must wear with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be unbecoming if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t well known you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthem belonging to you as can afford to give you such things when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve done with \xe2\x80\x99em themselves. It stands to reason I must give my\r\nown niece clothes now and then,\xe2\x80\x94such things as _I_ buy every year, and\r\nnever wear anything out. And as for Lucy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no giving to her, for\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s got everything o\xe2\x80\x99 the choicest; sister Deane may well hold her\r\nhead up,\xe2\x80\x94though she looks dreadful yallow, poor thing\xe2\x80\x94I doubt this\r\nliver complaint \xe2\x80\x99ull carry her off. That\xe2\x80\x99s what this new vicar, this Dr\r\nKenn, said in the funeral sermon to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful preacher, by all account,\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Sophy?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Tulliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs Pullet,\r\nwith her eyes fixed in a ruminating manner, \xe2\x80\x9cas I don\xe2\x80\x99t say I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot as good, but I must look out my best to match it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s called the bell o\xe2\x80\x99 St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, they say; that\xe2\x80\x99s a cur\xe2\x80\x99ous\r\nword,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Pullet, on whom the mysteries of etymology sometimes\r\nfell with an oppressive weight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a small thing, not\r\nmuch of a figure. But fine feathers make fine birds. I see nothing to\r\nadmire so much in those diminutive women; they look silly by the side\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the men,\xe2\x80\x94out o\xe2\x80\x99 proportion. When I chose my wife, I chose her the\r\nright size,\xe2\x80\x94neither too little nor too big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor wife, with her withered beauty, smiled complacently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the men aren\xe2\x80\x99t _all_ big,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet, not without some\r\nself-reference; \xe2\x80\x9ca young fellow may be good-looking and yet not be a\r\nsix-foot, like Master Tom here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s poor talking about littleness and bigness,\xe2\x80\x94anybody may think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy they\xe2\x80\x99re straight,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s that mismade\r\nson o\xe2\x80\x99 Lawyer Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s, I saw him at church to-day. Dear, dear! to think\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the property he\xe2\x80\x99s like to have; and they say he\xe2\x80\x99s very queer and\r\nlonely, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like much company. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he goes out of\r\nhis mind; for we never come along the road but he\xe2\x80\x99s a-scrambling out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe trees and brambles at the Red Deeps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis wide statement, by which Mrs Pullet represented the fact that she\r\nhad twice seen Philip at the spot indicated, produced an effect on\r\nMaggie which was all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her, and\r\nshe was intensely anxious to look indifferent. At Philip\xe2\x80\x99s name she had\r\nblushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness, until\r\nthe mention of the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were\r\nbetrayed, and she dared not even hold her tea-spoon lest she should\r\nshow how she trembled. She sat with her hands clasped under the table,\r\nnot daring to look round. Happily, her father was seated on the same\r\nside with herself, beyond her uncle Pullet, and could not see her face\r\nwithout stooping forward. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice brought the first relief,\r\nturning the conversation; for Mrs Tulliver was always alarmed when the\r\nname of Wakem was mentioned in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Gradually Maggie\r\nrecovered composure enough to look up; her eyes met Tom\xe2\x80\x99s, but he\r\nturned away his head immediately; and she went to bed that night\r\nwondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion. Perhaps\r\nnot; perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s mention\r\nof Wakem before her father; that was the interpretation her mother had\r\nput on it. To her father, Wakem was like a disfiguring disease, of\r\nwhich he was obliged to endure the consciousness, but was exasperated\r\nto have the existence recognised by others; and no amount of\r\nsensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising, Maggie\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBut Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an\r\ninterpretation; he had seen clearly enough that there was something\r\ndistinct from anxiety about her father in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s excessive confusion.\r\nIn trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his\r\nsuspicions, he remembered only lately hearing his mother scold Maggie\r\nfor walking in the Red Deeps when the ground was wet, and bringing home\r\nshoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining all his old repulsion\r\nfor Philip\xe2\x80\x99s deformity, shrank from attributing to his sister the\r\nprobability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an\r\nunfortunate exception to the common run of men. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s was a nature\r\nwhich had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional.\r\nA love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman, in a sister\r\nintolerable. But if she had been carrying on any kind of intercourse\r\nwhatever with Philip, a stop must be put to it at once; she was\r\ndisobeying her father\xe2\x80\x99s strongest feelings and her brother\xe2\x80\x99s express\r\ncommands, besides compromising herself by secret meetings. He left home\r\nthe next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most\r\nordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, about half-past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Tom was standing on the\r\nwharf, talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship\r\nAdelaide coming in, in a day or two, with results highly important to\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, parenthetically, as he looked over the fields on the\r\nother side of the river, \xe2\x80\x9cthere goes that crooked young Wakem. I know\r\nhim or his shadder as far off as I can see \xe2\x80\x99em; I\xe2\x80\x99m allays lighting on\r\nhim o\xe2\x80\x99 that side the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go,\r\nBob,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve something to attend to,\xe2\x80\x9d hurrying off to the\r\nwarehouse, where he left notice for some one to take his place; he was\r\ncalled away home on peremptory business.\r\n\r\nThe swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate, and he\r\nwas pausing to open it deliberately, that he might walk into the house\r\nwith an appearance of perfect composure, when Maggie came out at the\r\nfront door in bonnet and shawl. His conjecture was fulfilled, and he\r\nwaited for her at the gate. She started violently when she saw him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, how is it you are come home? Is there anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMaggie spoke in a low, tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come to walk with you to the Red Deeps, and meet Philip Wakem,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tom, the central fold in his brow, which had become habitual with\r\nhim, deepening as he spoke.\r\n\r\nMaggie stood helpless, pale and cold. By some means, then, Tom knew\r\neverything. At last she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going,\xe2\x80\x9d and turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are; but I want to speak to you first. Where is my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut on horseback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the yard, I think, with the poultry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can go in, then, without her seeing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked in together, and Tom, entering the parlour, said to Maggie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, and he closed the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Maggie, tell me this instant everything that has passed between\r\nyou and Philip Wakem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes my father know anything?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, still trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he _shall_ know, if you attempt to use\r\ndeceit toward me any further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to use deceit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, flushing into resentment at\r\nhearing this word applied to her conduct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the whole truth, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind whether I know it or not. Tell me exactly what has\r\nhappened, or my father shall know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell it for my father\xe2\x80\x99s sake, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it becomes you to profess affection for your father, when you\r\nhave despised his strongest feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never do wrong, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, tauntingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Tom, with proud sincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed\r\nbetween you and Philip Wakem. When did you first meet him in the Red\r\nDeeps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, quietly. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s severity gave her a certain\r\nfund of defiance, and kept her sense of error in abeyance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need\r\nask me no more questions. We have been friendly a year. We have met and\r\nwalked together often. He has lent me books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, looking straight at her with his frown.\r\n\r\nMaggie paused a moment; then, determined to make an end of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nto accuse her of deceit, she said haughtily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not quite all. On Saturday he told me that he loved me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of it before then; I had only thought of him as an old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you _encouraged_ him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with an expression of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him that I loved him too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was silent a few moments, looking on the ground and frowning, with\r\nhis hands in his pockets. At last he looked up and said coldly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, Maggie, there are but two courses for you to take,\xe2\x80\x94either\r\nyou vow solemnly to me, with your hand on my father\xe2\x80\x99s Bible, that you\r\nwill never have another meeting or speak another word in private with\r\nPhilip Wakem, or you refuse, and I tell my father everything; and this\r\nmonth, when by my exertions he might be made happy once more, you will\r\ncause him the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient, deceitful\r\ndaughter, who throws away her own respectability by clandestine\r\nmeetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her father.\r\nChoose!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom ended with cold decision, going up to the large Bible,\r\ndrawing it forward, and opening it at the fly-leaf, where the writing\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIt was a crushing alternative to Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, urged out of pride into pleading, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me that.\r\nI will promise you to give up all intercourse with Philip, if you will\r\nlet me see him once, or even only write to him and explain\r\neverything,\xe2\x80\x94to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to my\r\nfather. I feel something for Philip too. _He_ is not happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to hear anything of your feelings; I have said exactly\r\nwhat I mean. Choose, and quickly, lest my mother should come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I give you my word, that will be as strong a bond to me as if I\r\nlaid my hand on the Bible. I don\xe2\x80\x99t require that to bind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what _I_ require,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t trust you, Maggie. There is\r\nno consistency in you. Put your hand on this Bible, and say, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nrenounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip Wakem from this\r\ntime forth.\xe2\x80\x99 Else you will bring shame on us all, and grief on my\r\nfather; and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up\r\neverything else for the sake of paying my father\xe2\x80\x99s debts, if you are to\r\nbring madness and vexation on him, just when he might be easy and hold\r\nup his head once more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, _will_ the debts be paid soon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, clasping her\r\nhands, with a sudden flash of joy across her wretchedness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf things turn out as I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, his voice\r\ntrembling with indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I have been contriving and working\r\nthat my father may have some peace of mind before he dies,\xe2\x80\x94working for\r\nthe respectability of our family,\xe2\x80\x94you have done all you can to destroy\r\nboth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie felt a deep movement of compunction; for the moment, her mind\r\nceased to contend against what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable,\r\nand in her self-blame she justified her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cit was wrong of me; but I was so\r\nlonely, and I was sorry for Philip. And I think enmity and hatred are\r\nwicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cYour duty was clear enough. Say no more; but\r\npromise, in the words I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ speak to Philip once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go with me now and speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your\r\nknowledge. That is the only thing I will say. I will put my hand on the\r\nBible if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the\r\npromise. Tom closed the book, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken as they walked along. Maggie was suffering in\r\nanticipation of what Philip was about to suffer, and dreading the\r\ngalling words that would fall on him from Tom\xe2\x80\x99s lips; but she felt it\r\nwas in vain to attempt anything but submission. Tom had his terrible\r\nclutch on her conscience and her deepest dread; she writhed under the\r\ndemonstrable truth of the character he had given to her conduct, and\r\nyet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its\r\nincompleteness. He, meanwhile, felt the impetus of his indignation\r\ndiverted toward Philip. He did not know how much of an old boyish\r\nrepulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the\r\nbitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son\r\nand a brother. Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives\r\nany more than into other matters of an intangible kind; he was quite\r\nsure that his own motives as well as actions were good, else he would\r\nhave had nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s only hope was that something might, for the first time, have\r\nprevented Philip from coming. Then there would be delay,\xe2\x80\x94then she might\r\nget Tom\xe2\x80\x99s permission to write to him. Her heart beat with double\r\nviolence when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment of\r\nsuspense, she thought; Philip always met her soon after she got beyond\r\nthem. But they passed across the more open green space, and entered the\r\nnarrow bushy path by the mound. Another turning, and they came so close\r\nupon him that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of\r\neach other. There was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, in which Philip darted a look\r\nof inquiry at Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face. He saw an answer there, in the pale,\r\nparted lips, and the terrified tension of the large eyes. Her\r\nimagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate\r\nimpression, saw her tall, strong brother grasping the feeble Philip\r\nbodily, crushing him and trampling on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom\r\nsaid, in a voice of harsh scorn, as soon as Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were turned\r\non him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what I mean. I mean, taking advantage of a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with you.\r\nI mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a\r\ngood and honest name to support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deny that,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Philip, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI could never trifle\r\nwith anything that affected your sister\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. She is dearer to\r\nme than she is to you; I honour her more than you can ever honour her;\r\nI would give up my life to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend that\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week\r\nafter week? Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of\r\nlove to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither\r\nher father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between\r\nyou? And _you_,\xe2\x80\x94_you_ to try and worm yourself into the affections of a\r\nhandsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been shut out from the world\r\nby her father\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes! That\xe2\x80\x99s your crooked notion of honour, is\r\nit? I call it base treachery; I call it taking advantage of\r\ncircumstances to win what\xe2\x80\x99s too good for you,\xe2\x80\x94what you\xe2\x80\x99d never get by\r\nfair means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is manly of you to talk in this way to _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\r\nbitterly, his whole frame shaken by violent emotions. \xe2\x80\x9cGiants have an\r\nimmemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are incapable\r\neven of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for\r\nher that I could even desire to be at friendship with _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very sorry to understand your feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with\r\nscorching contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wish is that you should understand\r\n_me_,\xe2\x80\x94that I shall take care of _my_ sister, and that if you dare to\r\nmake the least attempt to come near her, or to write to her, or to keep\r\nthe slightest hold on her mind, your puny, miserable body, that ought\r\nto have put some modesty into your mind, shall not protect you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthrash you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at the\r\nidea of _your_ turning lover to a fine girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He burst out, in a\r\nconvulsed voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then\r\nlooking at Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have dragged your sister here, I suppose, that she\r\nmay stand by while you threaten and insult me. These naturally seemed\r\nto you the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken. Let your\r\nsister speak. If she says she is bound to give me up, I shall abide by\r\nher wishes to the slightest word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was for my father\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cTom\r\nthreatens to tell my father, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it; I have promised,\r\nI have vowed solemnly, that we will not have any intercourse without my\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough, Maggie. _I_ shall not change; but I wish you to hold\r\nyourself entirely free. But trust me; remember that I can never seek\r\nfor anything but good to what belongs to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\r\ntalk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now; did you seek\r\nher good before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x94at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her to have a friend for\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x94who would cherish her, who would do her more justice than a\r\ncoarse and narrow-minded brother, that she has always lavished her\r\naffections on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my way of befriending her is different from yours; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what is my way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll save her from disobeying and disgracing her\r\nfather; I\xe2\x80\x99ll save her from throwing herself away on you,\xe2\x80\x94from making\r\nherself a laughing-stock,\xe2\x80\x94from being flouted by a man like _your_\r\nfather, because she\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough for his son. You know well enough\r\nwhat sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nto be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean. Come\r\naway, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s right wrist as he spoke, and she put out her left\r\nhand. Philip clasped it an instant, with one eager look, and then\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\nTom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He was still\r\nholding her wrist tightly, as if he were compelling a culprit from the\r\nscene of action. At last Maggie, with a violent snatch, drew her hand\r\naway, and her pent-up, long-gathered irritation burst into utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to your\r\nwill. I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip; I\r\ndetest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his deformity. You have\r\nbeen reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure\r\nyou yourself are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough\r\nto see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your own\r\npetty aims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that your conduct is\r\nbetter, or your aims either. If your conduct, and Philip Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being known? Answer\r\nme that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded;\r\npray, what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to defend myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, still with vehemence: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrong,\xe2\x80\x94often, continually. But yet, sometimes when I\r\nhave done wrong, it has been because I have feelings that you would be\r\nthe better for, if you had them. If _you_ were in fault ever, if you\r\nhad done anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it brought\r\nyou; I should not want punishment to be heaped on you. But you have\r\nalways enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and cruel to me;\r\neven when I was a little girl, and always loved you better than any one\r\nelse in the world, you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving\r\nme. You have no pity; you have no sense of your own imperfection and\r\nyour own sins. It is a sin to be hard; it is not fitting for a mortal,\r\nfor a Christian. You are nothing but a Pharisee. You thank God for\r\nnothing but your own virtues; you think they are great enough to win\r\nyou everything else. You have not even a vision of feelings by the side\r\nof which your shining virtues are mere darkness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with cold scorn, \xe2\x80\x9cif your feelings are so much better\r\nthan mine, let me see you show them in some other way than by conduct\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s likely to disgrace us all,\xe2\x80\x94than by ridiculous flights first into\r\none extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown your love,\r\nthat you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying and\r\ndeceiving us. I have a different way of showing my affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I _will_ submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I will\r\nsubmit even to what is unreasonable from my father, but I will not\r\nsubmit to it from you. You boast of your virtues as if they purchased\r\nyou a right to be cruel and unmanly, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to-day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The deformity\r\nyou insult would make me cling to him and care for him the more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; that is your view of things.\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, more coldly than\r\never; \xe2\x80\x9cyou need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is\r\nbetween us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom went back to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, to fulfill an appointment with his uncle\r\nDeane, and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set\r\nout the next morning.\r\n\r\nMaggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant\r\nremonstrance, against which Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind was close barred, in bitter\r\ntears. Then, when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by,\r\ncame the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had\r\nended in to-day\xe2\x80\x99s misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of\r\nher life. She used to think in that time that she had made great\r\nconquests, and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly\r\ntemptations and conflict. And here she was down again in the thick of a\r\nhot strife with her own and others\xe2\x80\x99 passions. Life was not so short,\r\nthen, and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she was\r\ntwo years younger. There was more struggle for her, and perhaps more\r\nfalling. If she had felt that she was entirely wrong, and that Tom had\r\nbeen entirely right, she could sooner have recovered more inward\r\nharmony; but now her penitence and submission were constantly\r\nobstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise\r\nthan as a just indignation. Her heart bled for Philip; she went on\r\nrecalling the insults that had been flung at him with so vivid a\r\nconception of what he had felt under them, that it was almost like a\r\nsharp bodily pain to her, making her beat the floor with her foot and\r\ntighten her fingers on her palm.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain\r\ndim background of relief in the forced separation from Philip? Surely\r\nit was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was\r\nwelcome at any cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe Hard-Won Triumph\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in\r\nall the year,\xe2\x80\x94the great chestnuts in blossom, and the grass all deep\r\nand daisied,\xe2\x80\x94Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the\r\nevening, and as he passed over the bridge, he looked with the old\r\ndeep-rooted affection at the respectable red brick house, which always\r\nseemed cheerful and inviting outside, let the rooms be as bare and the\r\nhearts as sad as they might inside. There is a very pleasant light in\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s blue-gray eyes as he glances at the house-windows; that fold in\r\nhis brow never disappears, but it is not unbecoming; it seems to imply\r\na strength of will that may possibly be without harshness, when the\r\neyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm step becomes\r\nquicker, and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression\r\nwhich is meant to forbid a smile.\r\n\r\nThe eyes in the parlour were not turned toward the bridge just then,\r\nand the group there was sitting in unexpectant silence,\xe2\x80\x94Mr Tulliver in\r\nhis arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and ruminating with a worn look,\r\nfixed chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her sewing while her\r\nmother was making the tea.\r\n\r\nThey all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s up now, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bit earlier than\r\nusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well,\r\nmother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom went up to his mother and kissed her, a sign of unusual good-humour\r\nwith him. Hardly a word or look had passed between him and Maggie in\r\nall the three weeks; but his usual incommunicativeness at home\r\nprevented this from being noticeable to their parents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, when they had finished tea, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know exactly\r\nhow much money there is in the tin box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a hundred and ninety-three pound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought less o\xe2\x80\x99 late; but young fellows like to have their own way with\r\ntheir money. Though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as I liked before _I_ was of age.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nspoke with rather timid discontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure that\xe2\x80\x99s the sum, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\r\nwould take the trouble to fetch the tin box down. I think you have\r\nperhaps made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I make a mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve counted\r\nit often enough; but I can fetch it, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was always an incident Mr Tulliver liked, in his gloomy life, to\r\nfetch the tin box and count the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go out of the room, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, as he saw her moving when\r\nhis father was gone upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t Maggie to go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause somebody must\r\ntake away the things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as she likes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom indifferently.\r\n\r\nThat was a cutting word to Maggie. Her heart had leaped with the sudden\r\nconviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts could be\r\npaid; and Tom would have let her be absent when that news was told! But\r\nshe carried away the tray and came back immediately. The feeling of\r\ninjury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment.\r\n\r\nTom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box\r\nwas set down and opened, and the red evening light falling on them made\r\nconspicuous the worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed father and the\r\nsuppressed joy in the face of the fair-complexioned son. The mother and\r\nMaggie sat at the other end of the table, the one in blank patience,\r\nthe other in palpitating expectation.\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table,\r\nand then said, glancing sharply at Tom:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! you see I was right enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more nor three hundred wanting; it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fine while before\r\n_I_ can save that. Losing that forty-two pound wi\xe2\x80\x99 the corn was a sore\r\njob. This world\xe2\x80\x99s been too many for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s took four year to lay\r\n_this_ by; it\xe2\x80\x99s much if I\xe2\x80\x99m above ground for another four year. I must\r\ntrusten to you to pay \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, with a trembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nkeep i\xe2\x80\x99 the same mind now you\xe2\x80\x99re coming o\xe2\x80\x99 age. But you\xe2\x80\x99re like enough\r\nto bury me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face with a querulous desire for some assurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, speaking with energetic decision, though there\r\nwas tremor discernible in his voice too, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will live to see the\r\ndebts all paid. You shall pay them with your own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution. A\r\nslight electric shock seemed to pass through Mr Tulliver, and he kept\r\nhis eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager inquiry, while Maggie,\r\nunable to restrain herself, rushed to her father\xe2\x80\x99s side and knelt down\r\nby him. Tom was silent a little while before he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with,\r\nand that has answered. I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the\r\nbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were\r\nuttered, and she said, half crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my boy, I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d make iverything right again, when you got a\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of\r\nspeech. Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy\r\nmight even be fatal. But the blessed relief of tears came. The broad\r\nchest heaved, the muscles of the face gave way, and the gray-haired man\r\nburst into loud sobs. The fit of weeping gradually subsided, and he sat\r\nquiet, recovering the regularity of his breathing. At last he looked up\r\nat his wife and said, in a gentle tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessy, you must come and kiss me now\xe2\x80\x94the lad has made you amends.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 comfort again, belike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had kissed him, and he had held her hand a minute, his\r\nthoughts went back to the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d brought me the money to look at, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fingering\r\nthe sovereigns on the table; \xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 felt surer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see it to-morrow, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle Deane has\r\nappointed the creditors to meet to-morrow at the Golden Lion, and he\r\nhas ordered a dinner for them at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. My uncle Glegg and he\r\nwill both be there. It was advertised in the \xe2\x80\x98Messenger\xe2\x80\x99 on Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Wakem knows on\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, his eye kindling with\r\ntriumphant fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, with a long-drawn guttural\r\nenunciation, taking out his snuff-box, the only luxury he had left\r\nhimself, and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get from under _his_ thumb now, though I _must_ leave the old\r\nmill. I thought I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 held out to die here\xe2\x80\x94but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\na glass o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing in the house, have we, Bessy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, drawing out her much-reduced bunch of keys,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s some brandy sister Deane brought me when I was ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it me, then; get it me. I feel a bit weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a stronger voice, when he had taken some\r\nbrandy-and-water, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall make a speech to \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x99em it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyou as got the best part o\xe2\x80\x99 the money. They\xe2\x80\x99ll see I\xe2\x80\x99m honest at last,\r\nand ha\xe2\x80\x99 got an honest son. Ah! Wakem \xe2\x80\x99ud be fine and glad to have a son\r\nlike mine,\xe2\x80\x94a fine straight fellow,\xe2\x80\x94i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 that poor crooked\r\ncreatur! You\xe2\x80\x99ll prosper i\xe2\x80\x99 the world, my lad; you\xe2\x80\x99ll maybe see the day\r\nwhen Wakem and his son \xe2\x80\x99ull be a round or two below you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll like\r\nenough be ta\xe2\x80\x99en into partnership, as your uncle Deane was before\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re in the right way for\xe2\x80\x99t; and then there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to hinder\r\nyour getting rich. And if ever you\xe2\x80\x99re rich enough\xe2\x80\x94mind this\xe2\x80\x94try and get\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 old mill again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver threw himself back in his chair; his mind, which had so\r\nlong been the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding,\r\nsuddenly filled, by the magic of joy, with visions of good fortune. But\r\nsome subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as\r\nhappening to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake hands wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly putting out his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing when a man can be proud as he\xe2\x80\x99s got a good son.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had _that_ luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that; and\r\nMaggie couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help forgetting her own grievances. Tom _was_ good; and\r\nin the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true\r\nadmiration and gratitude, she felt that the faults he had to pardon in\r\nher had never been redeemed, as his faults were. She felt no jealousy\r\nthis evening that, for the first time, she seemed to be thrown into the\r\nbackground in her father\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nThere was much more talk before bedtime. Mr Tulliver naturally wanted\r\nto hear all the particulars of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s trading adventures, and he\r\nlistened with growing excitement and delight. He was curious to know\r\nwhat had been said on every occasion; if possible, what had been\r\nthought; and Bob Jakin\xe2\x80\x99s part in the business threw him into peculiar\r\noutbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that\r\nremarkable packman. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile history, so far as it had come under\r\nMr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, was recalled with that sense of astonishing\r\npromise it displayed, which is observable in all reminiscences of the\r\nchildhood of great men.\r\n\r\nIt was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the\r\nvague but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem, which would otherwise\r\nhave been the channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous\r\nforce. Even as it was, that feeling from time to time gave threats of\r\nits ultimate mastery, in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation.\r\n\r\nIt was long before Mr Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the sleep,\r\nwhen it came, was filled with vivid dreams. At half-past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the morning, when Mrs Tulliver was already rising, he alarmed her by\r\nstarting up with a sort of smothered shout, and looking round in a\r\nbewildered way at the walls of the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Mr Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. He looked at her,\r\nstill with a puzzled expression, and said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94I was dreaming\xe2\x80\x94did I make a noise?\xe2\x80\x94I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d got hold of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nA Day of Reckoning\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver was an essentially sober man,\xe2\x80\x94able to take his glass and\r\nnot averse to it, but never exceeding the bounds of moderation. He had\r\nnaturally an active Hotspur temperament, which did not crave liquid\r\nfire to set it aglow; his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting\r\noccasion without any such reinforcements; and his desire for the\r\nbrandy-and-water implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a\r\ndangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and\r\nunaccustomed hard fare. But that first doubtful tottering moment\r\npassed, he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement; and\r\nthe next day, when he was seated at table with his creditors, his eye\r\nkindling and his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about\r\nto make an honourable figure once more, he looked more like the proud,\r\nconfident, warm-hearted, and warm-tempered Tulliver of old times than\r\nmight have seemed possible to any one who had met him a week before,\r\nriding along as had been his wont for the last four years since the\r\nsense of failure and debt had been upon him,\xe2\x80\x94with his head hanging\r\ndown, casting brief, unwilling looks on those who forced themselves on\r\nhis notice. He made his speech, asserting his honest principles with\r\nhis old confident eagerness, alluding to the rascals and the luck that\r\nhad been against him, but that he had triumphed over, to some extent,\r\nby hard efforts and the aid of a good son; and winding up with the\r\nstory of how Tom had got the best part of the needful money. But the\r\nstreak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little\r\nwhile into purer fatherly pride and pleasure, when, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s health having\r\nbeen proposed, and uncle Deane having taken occasion to say a few words\r\nof eulogy on his general character and conduct, Tom himself got up and\r\nmade the single speech of his life. It could hardly have been briefer.\r\nHe thanked the gentlemen for the honour they had done him. He was glad\r\nthat he had been able to help his father in proving his integrity and\r\nregaining his honest name; and, for his own part, he hoped he should\r\nnever undo that work and disgrace that name. But the applause that\r\nfollowed was so great, and Tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall\r\nand straight, that Mr Tulliver remarked, in an explanatory manner, to\r\nhis friends on his right and left, that he had spent a deal of money on\r\nhis son\xe2\x80\x99s education.\r\n\r\nThe party broke up in very sober fashion at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Tom remained\r\nin St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s to attend to some business, and Mr Tulliver mounted his\r\nhorse to go home, and describe the memorable things that had been said\r\nand done, to \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Bessy and the little wench.\xe2\x80\x9d The air of excitement\r\nthat hung about him was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus\r\nbut the potent wine of triumphant joy. He did not choose any back\r\nstreet to-day, but rode slowly, with uplifted head and free glances,\r\nalong the principal street all the way to the bridge.\r\n\r\nWhy did he not happen to meet Wakem? The want of that coincidence vexed\r\nhim, and set his mind at work in an irritating way. Perhaps Wakem was\r\ngone out of town to-day on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything\r\nof an honourable action which might well cause him some unpleasant\r\ntwinges. If Wakem were to meet him then, Mr Tulliver would look\r\nstraight at him, and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a little by\r\nhis cool, domineering impudence. He would know by and by that an honest\r\nman was not going to serve _him_ any longer, and lend his honesty to\r\nfill a pocket already over-full of dishonest gains. Perhaps the luck\r\nwas beginning to turn; perhaps the Devil didn\xe2\x80\x99t always hold the best\r\ncards in this world.\r\n\r\nSimmering in this way, Mr Tulliver approached the yardgates of Dorlcote\r\nMill, near enough to see a well-known figure coming out of them on a\r\nfine black horse. They met about fifty yards from the gates, between\r\nthe great chestnuts and elms and the high bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, abruptly, in a haughtier tone than usual, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\na fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick you did,\xe2\x80\x94spreading those hard lumps on that Far Close! I\r\ntold you how it would be; but you men never learn to farm with any\r\nmethod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tulliver, suddenly boiling up; \xe2\x80\x9cget somebody else to farm\r\nfor you, then, as\xe2\x80\x99ll ask _you_ to teach him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been drinking, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, really believing that\r\nthis was the meaning of Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s flushed face and sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tulliver; \xe2\x80\x9cI want no drinking to\r\nhelp me make up my mind as I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve no longer under a scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well! you may leave my premises to-morrow, then; hold your\r\ninsolent tongue and let me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d (Tulliver was backing his horse\r\nacross the road to hem Wakem in.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I _sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ let you pass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tulliver, getting fiercer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall tell you what I think of you first. You\xe2\x80\x99re too big a raskill to\r\nget hanged\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass, you ignorant brute, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride over you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Tulliver, spurring his horse and raising his whip, made a rush\r\nforward; and Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s horse, rearing and staggering backward, threw his\r\nrider from the saddle and sent him sideways on the ground. Wakem had\r\nhad the presence of mind to loose the bridle at once, and as the horse\r\nonly staggered a few paces and then stood still, he might have risen\r\nand remounted without more inconvenience than a bruise and a shake. But\r\nbefore he could rise, Tulliver was off his horse too. The sight of the\r\nlong-hated predominant man down, and in his power, threw him into a\r\nfrenzy of triumphant vengeance, which seemed to give him preternatural\r\nagility and strength. He rushed on Wakem, who was in the act of trying\r\nto recover his feet, grasped him by the left arm so as to press Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhole weight on the right arm, which rested on the ground, and flogged\r\nhim fiercely across the back with his riding-whip. Wakem shouted for\r\nhelp, but no help came, until a woman\xe2\x80\x99s scream was heard, and the cry\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cFather, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Wakem felt, something had arrested Mr Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s arm; for the\r\nflogging ceased, and the grasp on his own arm was relaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away with you\xe2\x80\x94go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tulliver, angrily. But it was not to Wakem\r\nthat he spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he turned his head, saw\r\nthat Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s arms were being held by a girl, rather by the fear of\r\nhurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Luke\xe2\x80\x94mother\xe2\x80\x94come and help Mr Wakem!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie cried, as she heard\r\nthe longed-for footsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me on to that low horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem to Luke, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall\r\nperhaps manage; though\xe2\x80\x94confound it\xe2\x80\x94I think this arm is sprained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty, Wakem was heaved on to Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s horse. Then he\r\nturned toward the miller and said, with white rage, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer for\r\nthis, sir. Your daughter is a witness that you\xe2\x80\x99ve assaulted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Tulliver, in a thick, fierce voice; \xe2\x80\x9cgo and\r\nshow your back, and tell \xe2\x80\x99em I thrashed you. Tell \xe2\x80\x99em I\xe2\x80\x99ve made things\r\na bit more even i\xe2\x80\x99 the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRide my horse home with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem to Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the Tofton Ferry,\r\nnot through the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, come in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, imploringly. Then, seeing that Wakem\r\nhad ridden off, and that no further violence was possible, she\r\nslackened her hold and burst into hysteric sobs, while poor Mrs\r\nTulliver stood by in silence, quivering with fear. But Maggie became\r\nconscious that as she was slackening her hold her father was beginning\r\nto grasp her and lean on her. The surprise checked her sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel ill\xe2\x80\x94faintish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me in, Bessy\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m giddy\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\npain i\xe2\x80\x99 the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked in slowly, propped by his wife and daughter and tottered into\r\nhis arm-chair. The almost purple flush had given way to paleness, and\r\nhis hand was cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better send for the doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her; but presently,\r\nwhen she said to Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cGo and seek for somebody to fetch the\r\ndoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he looked up at her with full comprehension, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor? No\xe2\x80\x94no doctor. It\xe2\x80\x99s my head, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Help me to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of\r\nbetter times! But mingled seed must bear a mingled crop.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour after his father had lain down Tom came home. Bob Jakin\r\nwas with him, come to congratulate \xe2\x80\x9cthe old master,\xe2\x80\x9d not without some\r\nexcusable pride that he had had his share in bringing about Mr Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood luck; and Tom had thought his father would like nothing better, as\r\na finish to the day, than a talk with Bob. But now Tom could only spend\r\nthe evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant consequences that\r\nmust follow on this mad outbreak of his father\xe2\x80\x99s long-smothered hate.\r\nAfter the painful news had been told, he sat in silence; he had not\r\nspirit or inclination to tell his mother and sister anything about the\r\ndinner; they hardly cared to ask it. Apparently the mingled thread in\r\nthe web of their life was so curiously twisted together that there\r\ncould be no joy without a sorrow coming close upon it. Tom was dejected\r\nby the thought that his exemplary effort must always be baffled by the\r\nwrong-doing of others; Maggie was living through, over and over again,\r\nthe agony of the moment in which she had rushed to throw herself on her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s arm, with a vague, shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to\r\ncome. Not one of the three felt any particular alarm about Mr\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s health; the symptoms did not recall his former dangerous\r\nattack, and it seemed only a necessary consequence that his violent\r\npassion and effort of strength, after many hours of unusual excitement,\r\nshould have made him feel ill. Rest would probably cure him.\r\n\r\nTom, tired out by his active day, fell asleep soon, and slept soundly;\r\nit seemed to him as if he had only just come to bed, when he waked to\r\nsee his mother standing by him in the gray light of early morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, you must get up this minute; I\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for the doctor, and\r\nyour father wants you and Maggie to come to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he worse, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been very ill all night with his head, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworse; he only said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98Bessy, fetch the boy and girl. Tell \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nto make haste.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie and Tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light,\r\nand reached their father\xe2\x80\x99s room almost at the same moment. He was\r\nwatching for them with an expression of pain on his brow, but with\r\nsharpened, anxious consciousness in his eyes. Mrs Tulliver stood at the\r\nfoot of the bed, frightened and trembling, looking worn and aged from\r\ndisturbed rest. Maggie was at the bedside first, but her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglance was toward Tom, who came and stood next to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, my lad, it\xe2\x80\x99s come upon me as I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t get up again. This world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen too many for me, my lad, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve done what you could to make\r\nthings a bit even. Shake hands wi\xe2\x80\x99 me again, my lad, before I go away\r\nfrom you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father and son clasped hands and looked at each other an instant.\r\nThen Tom said, trying to speak firmly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any wish, father\xe2\x80\x94that I can fulfil, when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my lad\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll try and get the old mill back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s your mother\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll try and make her amends, all you can,\r\nfor my bad luck\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s the little wench\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father turned his eyes on Maggie with a still more eager look,\r\nwhile she, with a bursting heart, sank on her knees, to be closer to\r\nthe dear, time-worn face which had been present with her through long\r\nyears, as the sign of her deepest love and hardest trial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take care of her, Tom\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret, my wench\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nsomebody as\xe2\x80\x99ll love you and take your part\xe2\x80\x94and you must be good to her,\r\nmy lad. I was good to _my_ sister. Kiss me, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x94Come, Bessy.\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmanage to pay for a brick grave, Tom, so as your mother and me can lie\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked away from them all when he had said this, and lay silent for\r\nsome minutes, while they stood watching him, not daring to move. The\r\nmorning light was growing clearer for them, and they could see the\r\nheaviness gathering in his face, and the dulness in his eyes. But at\r\nlast he looked toward Tom and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had my turn\xe2\x80\x94I beat him. That was nothing but fair. I never wanted\r\nanything but what was fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father, dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, an unspeakable anxiety\r\npredominating over her grief, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forgive him\xe2\x80\x94you forgive every one\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not move his eyes to look at her, but he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my wench. I don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive him. What\xe2\x80\x99s forgiving to do? I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlove a raskill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had become thicker; but he wanted to say more, and moved his\r\nlips again and again, struggling in vain to speak. At length the words\r\nforced their way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes God forgive raskills?\xe2\x80\x94but if He does, He won\xe2\x80\x99t be hard wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hands moved uneasily, as if he wanted them to remove some\r\nobstruction that weighed upon him. Two or three times there fell from\r\nhim some broken words,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis world\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94too many\xe2\x80\x94honest man\xe2\x80\x94puzzling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon they merged into mere mutterings; the eyes had ceased to discern;\r\nand then came the final silence.\r\n\r\nBut not of death. For an hour or more the chest heaved, the loud, hard\r\nbreathing continued, getting gradually slower, as the cold dews\r\ngathered on the brow.\r\n\r\nAt last there was total stillness, and poor Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s dimly lighted\r\nsoul had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHelp was come now; Luke and his wife were there, and Mr Turnbull had\r\narrived, too late for everything but to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom and Maggie went downstairs together into the room where their\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s place was empty. Their eyes turned to the same spot, and\r\nMaggie spoke,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, forgive me\xe2\x80\x94let us always love each other\xe2\x80\x9d; and they clung and\r\nwept together.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SIXTH\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TEMPTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nA Duet in Paradise\r\n\r\nThe well-furnished drawing-room, with the open grand piano, and the\r\npleasant outlook down a sloping garden to a boat-house by the side of\r\nthe Floss, is Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s. The neat little lady in mourning, whose\r\nlight-brown ringlets are falling over the coloured embroidery with\r\nwhich her fingers are busy, is of course Lucy Deane; and the fine young\r\nman who is leaning down from his chair to snap the scissors in the\r\nextremely abbreviated face of the \xe2\x80\x9cKing Charles\xe2\x80\x9d lying on the young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s feet is no other than Mr Stephen Guest, whose diamond ring,\r\nattar of roses, and air of _nonchalant_ leisure, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe day, are the graceful and odoriferous result of the largest\r\noil-mill and the most extensive wharf in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. There is an apparent\r\ntriviality in the action with the scissors, but your discernment\r\nperceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it eminently\r\nworthy of a large-headed, long-limbed young man; for you see that Lucy\r\nwants the scissors, and is compelled, reluctant as she may be, to shake\r\nher ringlets back, raise her soft hazel eyes, smile playfully down on\r\nthe face that is so very nearly on a level with her knee, and holding\r\nout her little shell-pink palm, to say,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy scissors, please, if you can renounce the great pleasure of\r\npersecuting my poor Minny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles, it seems,\r\nand Hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound the scissors! The oval lies the wrong way. Please draw them\r\noff for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraw them off with your other hand,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Lucy, roguishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my left hand; I\xe2\x80\x99m not left-handed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy laughs, and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from\r\ntiny tips, which naturally dispose Mr Stephen for a repetition _da\r\ncapo_. Accordingly, he watches for the release of the scissors, that he\r\nmay get them into his possession again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, sticking them in her band, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall not have my\r\nscissors again,\xe2\x80\x94you have strained them already. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t set Minny\r\ngrowling again. Sit up and behave properly, and then I will tell you\r\nsome news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, throwing himself back and hanging his\r\nright arm over the corner of his chair. He might have been sitting for\r\nhis portrait, which would have represented a rather striking young man\r\nof five-and-twenty, with a square forehead, short dark-brown hair,\r\nstanding erect, with a slight wave at the end, like a thick crop of\r\ncorn, and a half-ardent, half-sarcastic glance from under his\r\nwell-marked horizontal eyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it very important news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very. Guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to change Minny\xe2\x80\x99s diet, and give him three ratafias\r\nsoaked in a dessert-spoonful of cream daily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Dr Kenn has been preaching against buckram, and you ladies\r\nhave all been sending him a roundrobin, saying, \xe2\x80\x98This is a hard\r\ndoctrine; who can bear it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, adjusting her little mouth gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nrather dull of you not to guess my news, because it is about something\r\nI mentioned to you not very long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have mentioned many things to me not long ago. Does your\r\nfeminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of\r\nseveral things, I should know it immediately by that mark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know you think I am silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are perfectly charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my silliness is part of my charm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know you like women to be rather insipid. Philip Wakem betrayed\r\nyou; he said so one day when you were not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know Phil is fierce on that point; he makes it quite a personal\r\nmatter. I think he must be love-sick for some unknown lady,\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nexalted Beatrice whom he met abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, pausing in her work, \xe2\x80\x9cit has just occurred to\r\nme that I never found out whether my cousin Maggie will object to see\r\nPhilip, as her brother does. Tom will not enter a room where Philip is,\r\nif he knows it; perhaps Maggie may be the same, and then we sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nable to sing our glees, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is your cousin coming to stay with you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, with a\r\nlook of slight annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that was my news, which you have forgotten. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave\r\nher situation, where she has been nearly two years, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x94ever\r\nsince her father\xe2\x80\x99s death; and she will stay with me a month or\r\ntwo,\xe2\x80\x94many months, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I bound to be pleased at that news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a little air of pique. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am\r\npleased, but that, of course, is no reason why _you_ should be pleased.\r\nThere is no girl in the world I love so well as my cousin Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will be inseparable I suppose, when she comes. There will be\r\nno possibility of a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with you any more, unless you can\r\nfind an admirer for her, who will pair off with her occasionally. What\r\nis the ground of dislike to Philip? He might have been a resource.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a family quarrel with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s father. There were very painful\r\ncircumstances, I believe. I never quite understood them, or knew them\r\nall. My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property, and I\r\nthink he considered Mr Wakem was somehow the cause of it. Mr Wakem\r\nbought Dorlcote Mill, my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s old place, where he always lived. You\r\nmust remember my uncle Tulliver, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, with rather supercilious indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nknown the name, and I dare say I knew the man by sight, apart from his\r\nname. I know half the names and faces in the neighbourhood in that\r\ndetached, disjointed way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a very hot-tempered man. I remember, when I was a little girl\r\nand used to go to see my cousins, he often frightened me by talking as\r\nif he were angry. Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel, the very\r\nday before my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death, between him and Mr Wakem, but it was\r\nhushed up. That was when you were in London. Papa says my uncle was\r\nquite mistaken in many ways; his mind had become embittered. But Tom\r\nand Maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these\r\nthings. They have had so much, so very much trouble. Maggie was at\r\nschool with me six years ago, when she was fetched away because of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes, and she has hardly had any pleasure since, I\r\nthink. She has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, because she is determined to be independent, and not live with\r\naunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her to come to me then, because\r\ndear mamma was ill, and everything was so sad. That is why I want her\r\nto come to me now, and have a long, long holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sweet and angelic of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, looking at her with an\r\nadmiring smile; \xe2\x80\x9cand all the more so if she has the conversational\r\nqualities of her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her. She is very valuable to\r\n_me_, I know. She manages the house beautifully,\xe2\x80\x94much better than any\r\nstranger would,\xe2\x80\x94and she was a great comfort to me in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be\r\nrepresented by her brandy-cherries and cream-cakes. I think with a\r\nshudder that her daughter will always be present in person, and have no\r\nagreeable proxies of that kind,\xe2\x80\x94a fat, blond girl, with round blue\r\neyes, who will stare at us silently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy, laughing wickedly, and clapping her hands,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is just my cousin Maggie. You must have seen her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed; I\xe2\x80\x99m only guessing what Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s daughter must be;\r\nand then if she is to banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor, that\r\nwill be an additional bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip\r\nand tell him Maggie is coming to-morrow. He is quite aware of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling, and always keeps out of his way; so he will understand, if you\r\ntell him, that I asked you to warn him not to come until I write to ask\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so\r\nsensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten him off coming at\r\nall, and we had hard work to get him. I can never induce him to come to\r\nthe park; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like my sisters, I think. It is only your fa\xc3\xabry\r\ntouch that can lay his ruffled feathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table,\r\nand touched it lightly with his lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and\r\nhappy. She and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the\r\nmost exquisite moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of\r\npassion,\xe2\x80\x94when each is sure of the other\xe2\x80\x99s love, but no formal\r\ndeclaration has been made, and all is mutual divination, exalting the\r\nmost trivial word, the lightest gesture, into thrills delicate and\r\ndelicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an engagement\r\nwears off this finest edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered\r\nand presented in a large bouquet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance and manners,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cunning Lucy, moving to reach her\r\ndesk, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause she might have been like her brother, you know; and Tom\r\nhas not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose he is like the father; he seems to be as proud as\r\nLucifer. Not a brilliant companion, though, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like Tom. He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very\r\nfond of him: he says Tom has excellent principles. It was through him\r\nthat his father was able to pay all his debts before he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about that. I heard your father and mine talking\r\nabout it a little while ago, after dinner, in one of their interminable\r\ndiscussions about business. They think of doing something for young\r\nTulliver; he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some\r\nmarvellous way, like Turpin, to bring them news about the stoppage of a\r\nbank, or something of that sort. But I was rather drowsy at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen rose from his seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in\r\nfalsetto, \xe2\x80\x9cGraceful Consort,\xe2\x80\x9d as he turned over the volume of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nCreation,\xe2\x80\x9d which stood open on the desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sing this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he saw Lucy rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, \xe2\x80\x98Graceful Consort\xe2\x80\x99? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it suits your voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; it exactly suits my feeling, which, Philip will have it,\r\nis the grand element of good singing. I notice men with indifferent\r\nvoices are usually of that opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip burst into one of his invectives against \xe2\x80\x98The Creation\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nother day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, seating herself at the piano. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says it has a\r\nsort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe in it, as if it\r\nwere written for the birthday _f\xc3\xaate_ of a German Grand-Duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pooh! He is the fallen Adam with a soured temper. We are Adam and\r\nEve unfallen, in Paradise. Now, then,\xe2\x80\x94the recitative, for the sake of\r\nthe moral. You will sing the whole duty of woman,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98And from obedience\r\ngrows my pride and happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I shall not respect an Adam who drags the _tempo_, as you\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, beginning to play the duet.\r\n\r\nSurely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in\r\nwhich the lovers can sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that\r\nsprings from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the\r\nright moment between the notes of the silvery soprano, from the perfect\r\naccord of descending thirds and fifths, from the preconcerted loving\r\nchase of a fugue, is likely enough to supersede any immediate demand\r\nfor less impassioned forms of agreement. The contralto will not care to\r\ncatechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of\r\nremark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the provinces,\r\ntoo, where music was so scarce in that remote time, how could the\r\nmusical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even political\r\nprinciple must have been in danger of relaxation under such\r\ncircumstances; and the violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have\r\nbeen tempted to fraternise in a demoralizing way with a reforming\r\nvioloncello. In that case, the linnet-throated soprano and the\r\nfull-toned bass singing,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWith thee delight is ever new,\r\n     With thee is life incessant bliss,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieved what they sang all the more _because_ they sang it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s great song,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, when they had finished the\r\nduet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do the \xe2\x80\x98heavy beasts\xe2\x80\x99 to perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds complimentary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nJove, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly half-past one! Well, I can just sing this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the\r\ntread of the heavy beasts; but when a singer has an audience of two,\r\nthere is room for divided sentiments. Minny\xe2\x80\x99s mistress was charmed; but\r\nMinny, who had intrenched himself, trembling, in his basket as soon as\r\nthe music began, found this thunder so little to his taste that he\r\nleaped out and scampered under the remotest _chiffonnier_, as the most\r\neligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of doom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, \xe2\x80\x98graceful consort,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, buttoning his coat across\r\nwhen he had done singing, and smiling down from his tall height, with\r\nthe air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the\r\nmusic-stool. \xe2\x80\x9cMy bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I\r\npromised to be there at lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no consequence;\r\nI have said everything in my note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are going to have a little family-party. My cousin Tom will\r\ndine with us; and poor aunty will have her two children together for\r\nthe first time. It will be very pretty; I think a great deal about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I may come the next day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can\r\nhardly be said not to have seen her, you have described her so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And there was that slight pressure of the hands, and\r\nmomentary meeting of the eyes, which will often leave a little lady\r\nwith a slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside\r\nimmediately when the door is closed, and with an inclination to walk up\r\nand down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her\r\nembroidery, or other rational and improving occupation. At least this\r\nwas the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider it an\r\nindication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she\r\njust glanced in the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it. The\r\ndesire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few\r\nhours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a\r\nlaudable benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of\r\nthis benevolence in her nature that I am inclined to think her small\r\negoisms were impregnated with it, just as there are people not\r\naltogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant\r\nand somewhat rank odor of egoism. Even now, that she is walking up and\r\ndown with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish heart at the sense\r\nthat she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her small\r\nworld, you may see in her hazel eyes an ever-present sunny benignity,\r\nin which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite\r\nlost; and if she is happy in thinking of her lover, it is because the\r\nthought of him mingles readily with all the gentle affections and\r\ngood-natured offices with which she fills her peaceful days. Even now,\r\nher mind, with that instantaneous alternation which makes two currents\r\nof feeling or imagination seem simultaneous, is glancing continually\r\nfrom Stephen to the preparations she has only half finished in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. Cousin Maggie should be treated as well as the grandest\r\nlady-visitor,\xe2\x80\x94nay, better, for she should have Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s best prints and\r\ndrawings in her bedroom, and the very finest bouquet of spring flowers\r\non her table. Maggie would enjoy all that, she was so found of pretty\r\nthings! And there was poor aunt Tulliver, that no one made any account\r\nof, she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative\r\nquality, and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner, for which\r\nLucy was going to lay a plot with her father this evening. Clearly, she\r\nhad not time to indulge in long reveries about her own happy\r\nlove-affairs. With this thought she walked toward the door, but paused\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, then, Minny?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, stooping in answer to some\r\nwhimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his glossy head against\r\nher pink cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you think I was going without you? Come, then, let\r\nus go and see Sinbad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSinbad was Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s chestnut horse, that she always fed with her own hand\r\nwhen he was turned out in the paddock. She was fond of feeding\r\ndependent creatures, and knew the private tastes of all the animals\r\nabout the house, delighting in the little rippling sounds of her\r\ncanaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed, and in the small\r\nnibbling pleasures of certain animals which, lest she should appear too\r\ntrivial, I will here call \xe2\x80\x9cthe more familiar rodents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim\r\nmaiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely\r\nto repent of marrying,\xe2\x80\x94a woman who was loving and thoughtful for other\r\nwomen, not giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on their welcome\r\ndefects, but with real care and vision for their half-hidden pains and\r\nmortifications, with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures\r\nprepared for them? Perhaps the emphasis of his admiration did not fall\r\nprecisely on this rarest quality in her; perhaps he approved his own\r\nchoice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable\r\nrarity. A man likes his wife to be pretty; well, Lucy was pretty, but\r\nnot to a maddening extent. A man likes his wife to be accomplished,\r\ngentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and Lucy had all these\r\nqualifications. Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with\r\nher, and was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to Miss\r\nLeyburn, the daughter of the county member, although Lucy was only the\r\ndaughter of his father\xe2\x80\x99s subordinate partner; besides, he had had to\r\ndefy and overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his\r\nfather and sisters,\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable\r\nconsciousness of his own dignity. Stephen was aware that he had sense\r\nand independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him\r\nhappy, unbiassed by any indirect considerations. He meant to choose\r\nLucy; she was a little darling, and exactly the sort of woman he had\r\nalways admired.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nFirst Impressions\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very clever, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. She was kneeling on a footstool\r\nat Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s feet, after placing that dark lady in the large\r\ncrimson-velvet chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sure you will like him. I hope you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very difficult to please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, and\r\nholding up one of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s long curls, that the sunlight might shine\r\nthrough it. \xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman who thinks he is good enough for Lucy must\r\nexpect to be sharply criticised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, he\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal too good for me. And sometimes, when he is\r\naway, I almost think it can\xe2\x80\x99t really be that he loves me. But I can\r\nnever doubt it when he is with me, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear any one but\r\nyou to know that I feel in that way, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then, if I disapprove of him you can give him up, since you are\r\nnot engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with playful gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to\r\nthink of being married soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, too thoroughly preoccupied to\r\nnotice Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s joke; \xe2\x80\x9cand I should like everything to go on for a long\r\nwhile just as it is. Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen\r\nshould say that he has spoken to papa; and from something that fell\r\nfrom papa the other day, I feel sure he and Mr Guest are expecting\r\nthat. And Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s sisters are very civil to me now. At first, I think\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his paying me attention; and that was natural. It\r\n_does_ seem out of keeping that I should ever live in a great place\r\nlike the Park House, such a little insignificant thing as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses\r\nthey live in, like snails,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, are Mr\r\nGuest\xe2\x80\x99s sisters giantesses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; and not handsome,\xe2\x80\x94that is, not very,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, half-penitent\r\nat this uncharitable remark. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _he_ is\xe2\x80\x94at least he is generally\r\nconsidered very handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough you are unable to share that opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, blushing pink over brow and neck. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\na bad plan to raise expectation; you will perhaps be disappointed. But\r\nI have prepared a charming surprise for _him;_ I shall have a glorious\r\nlaugh against him. I shall not tell you what it is, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance, holding her\r\npretty head on one side, as if she had been arranging Maggie for a\r\nportrait, and wished to judge of the general effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand up a moment, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your pleasure now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling languidly as she rose\r\nfrom her chair and looked down on her slight, aerial cousin, whose\r\nfigure was quite subordinate to her faultless drapery of silk and\r\ncrape.\r\n\r\nLucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence, and\r\nthen said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what witchery it is in you, Maggie, that makes you look\r\nbest in shabby clothes; though you really must have a new dress now.\r\nBut do you know, last night I was trying to fancy you in a handsome,\r\nfashionable dress, and do what I would, that old limp merino would come\r\nback as the only right thing for you. I wonder if Marie Antoinette\r\nlooked all the grander when her gown was darned at the elbows. Now, if\r\n_I_ were to put anything shabby on, I should be quite unnoticeable. I\r\nshould be a mere rag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with mock gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would be liable to be\r\nswept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpet-dust, and to find\r\nyourself under the grate, like Cinderella. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I sit down now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, now you may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, laughing. Then, with an air of serious\r\nreflection, unfastening her large jet brooch, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must change\r\nbrooches, Maggie; that little butterfly looks silly on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Maggie, seating herself submissively, while Lucy knelt again and\r\nunfastened the contemptible butterfly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish my mother were of your\r\nopinion, for she was fretting last night because this is my best frock.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been saving my money to pay for some lessons; I shall never get a\r\nbetter situation without more accomplishments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie gave a little sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t put on that sad look again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, pinning the large\r\nbrooch below Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s fine throat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting that you\xe2\x80\x99ve left\r\nthat dreary schoolroom behind you, and have no little girls\xe2\x80\x99 clothes to\r\nmend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is with me as I used to think it would be with\r\nthe poor uneasy white bear I saw at the show. I thought he must have\r\ngot so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that\r\nnarrow space that he would keep doing it if they set him free. One gets\r\na bad habit of being unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you\r\nlose that bad habit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, sticking the black butterfly absently\r\nin her own collar, while her eyes met Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s affectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dear, tiny thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in one of her bursts of loving\r\nadmiration, \xe2\x80\x9cyou enjoy other people\xe2\x80\x99s happiness so much, I believe you\r\nwould do without any of your own. I wish I were like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been tried in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always been so\r\nhappy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I could bear much trouble; I never had any\r\nbut poor mamma\xe2\x80\x99s death. You _have_ been tried, Maggie; and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\r\nfeel for other people quite as much as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, shaking her head slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy their\r\nhappiness as you do, else I should be more contented. I do feel for\r\nthem when they are in trouble; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could ever bear to make\r\nany one _un_happy; and yet I often hate myself, because I get angry\r\nsometimes at the sight of happy people. I think I get worse as I get\r\nolder, more selfish. That seems very dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, in a tone of remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a\r\nword of that. It is all a gloomy fancy, just because you are depressed\r\nby a dull, wearisome life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, resolutely clearing away the clouds\r\nfrom her face with a bright smile, and throwing herself backward in her\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it comes from the school diet,\xe2\x80\x94watery rice-pudding\r\nspiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncustards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie took up the \xe2\x80\x9cSketch Book,\xe2\x80\x9d which lay by her on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, going to\r\nsurvey the effect in the chimney-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Mr Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees\r\nyou in it. Pray make haste and put another on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity\r\nof opening her book; she let it fall on her knees, while her eyes\r\nwandered to the window, where she could see the sunshine falling on the\r\nrich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels, and\r\nbeyond, the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss, that at this\r\ndistance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday. The sweet fresh\r\ngarden-scent came through the open window, and the birds were busy\r\nflitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes began\r\nto fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of\r\nmemories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to\r\nrejoice in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s restored comfort and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s brotherly\r\nfriendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance,\r\nrather than in the presence of a happiness which we share. Memory and\r\nimagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her\r\ntaste what was offered in the transient present. Her future, she\r\nthought, was likely to be worse than her past, for after her years of\r\ncontented renunciation, she had slipped back into desire and longing;\r\nshe found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder; she\r\nfound the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and\r\ndespaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the\r\nopening door roused her, and hastily wiping away her tears, she began\r\nto turn over the leaves of her book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness\r\nwill never resist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she\r\nentered the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is music, and I mean you to have quite a\r\nriotous feast of it. I mean you to get up your playing again, which\r\nused to be so much better than mine, when we were at Laceham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have laughed to see me playing the little girls\xe2\x80\x99 tunes over\r\nand over to them, when I took them to practise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cjust for\r\nthe sake of fingering the dear keys again. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I\r\ncould play anything more difficult now than \xe2\x80\x98Begone, dull care!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee-men\r\ncame round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, taking up her embroidery; \xe2\x80\x9cand we might have\r\nall those old glees that you used to love so, if I were certain that\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel exactly as Tom does about some things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain of,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Maggie, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you feel\r\njust as he does about that, we shall want our third voice. St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s is\r\nso miserably provided with musical gentlemen. There are really only\r\nStephen and Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music, so as to be\r\nable to sing a part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence, and\r\nsaw that there was a change in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie? If it does, I\r\nwill not speak of him again. I know Tom will not see him if he can\r\navoid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at all as Tom does on that subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rising\r\nand going to the window as if she wanted to see more of the landscape.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked Philip Wakem ever since I was a little girl, and saw\r\nhim at Lorton. He was so good when Tom hurt his foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind his coming\r\nsometimes, and we can have much more music than we could without him.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he were not so morbid about\r\nhis deformity. I suppose it _is_ his deformity that makes him so sad,\r\nand sometimes bitter. It is certainly very piteous to see his poor\r\nlittle crooked body and pale face among great, strong people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Lucy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, trying to arrest the prattling stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there is the door-bell. That must be Stephen,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy went on, not\r\nnoticing Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s faint effort to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things I most\r\nadmire in Stephen is that he makes a greater friend of Philip than any\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was too late for Maggie to speak now; the drawingroom door was\r\nopening, and Minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance\r\nof a tall gentleman, who went up to Lucy and took her hand with a\r\nhalf-polite, half-tender glance and tone of inquiry, which seemed to\r\nindicate that he was unconscious of any other presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, turning\r\nwith wicked enjoyment toward Maggie, who now approached from the\r\nfarther window. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mr Stephen Guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight\r\nof this tall, dark-eyed nymph with her jet-black coronet of hair; the\r\nnext, Maggie felt herself, for the first time in her life, receiving\r\nthe tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a person\r\ntoward whom she herself was conscious of timidity.\r\n\r\nThis new experience was very agreeable to her, so agreeable that it\r\nalmost effaced her previous emotion about Philip. There was a new\r\nbrightness in her eyes, and a very becoming flush on her cheek, as she\r\nseated herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x99s confusion; the advantage was usually on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStephen, seating himself by Lucy, and stooping to play with Minny, only\r\nlooking at Maggie furtively. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said you had light hair and blue\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it was you who said so,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cI only refrained\r\nfrom destroying your confidence in your own second-sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could always err in the same way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x9cand find\r\nreality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you have proved yourself equal to the occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsaid what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flashed a slightly defiant look at him; it was clear to her that he\r\nhad been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand. Lucy had said\r\nhe was inclined to be satirical, and Maggie had mentally supplied the\r\naddition, \xe2\x80\x9cand rather conceited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn alarming amount of devil there,\xe2\x80\x9d was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s first thought. The\r\nsecond, when she had bent over her work, was, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish she would look at\r\nme again.\xe2\x80\x9d The next was to answer,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true. A\r\nman is occasionally grateful when he says \xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s rather hard\r\nupon him that he must use the same words with which all the world\r\ndeclines a disagreeable invitation, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, Miss Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; \xe2\x80\x9cif we use\r\ncommon words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because\r\nthey are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners,\r\nor everyday clothes, hung up in a sacred place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my compliment ought to be eloquent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, really not\r\nquite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing that the\r\nwords were so far beneath the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of\r\nindifference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, flushing a little.\r\n\r\nLucy was rather alarmed; she thought Stephen and Maggie were not going\r\nto like each other. She had always feared lest Maggie should appear too\r\nold and clever to please that critical gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have always pretended that you are too fond of\r\nbeing admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some one\r\nventures to admire you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie; \xe2\x80\x9cI like too well to feel that I am admired,\r\nbut compliments never make me feel that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never pay you a compliment again, Miss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; that will be a proof of respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Maggie! She was so unused to society that she could take nothing\r\nas a matter of course, and had never in her life spoken from the lips\r\nmerely, so that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced\r\nladies, from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very\r\ntrivial incidents. But she was even conscious herself of a little\r\nabsurdity in this instance. It was true she had a theoretic objection\r\nto compliments, and had once said impatiently to Philip that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful,\r\nany more than old men were to be told that they were venerable; still,\r\nto be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a stranger like\r\nMr Stephen Guest, and to care about his having spoken slightingly of\r\nher before he had seen her, was certainly unreasonable, and as soon as\r\nshe was silent she began to be ashamed of herself. It did not occur to\r\nher that her irritation was due to the pleasanter emotion which\r\npreceded it, just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing\r\nwarmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden\r\nsmart.\r\n\r\nStephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous\r\nconversation could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to\r\ntalk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was\r\nat length to take place, so that there might be some hope of seeing her\r\nrain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those\r\nworsted flowers that were growing under her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day next month, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your sisters are\r\ndoing more for it than I am; they are to have the largest stall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own\r\nsitting-room, where I don\xe2\x80\x99t intrude on them. I see you are not addicted\r\nto the fashionable vice of fancy-work, Miss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen,\r\nlooking at Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s plain hemming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing more difficult or more elegant\r\nthan shirt-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your plain sewing is so beautiful, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nthink I shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancy-work. Your\r\nexquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me, you used to dislike that\r\nsort of work so much in old days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a mystery easily explained, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking up\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cPlain sewing was the only thing I could get money by, so I\r\nwas obliged to try and do it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy, good and simple as she was, could not help blushing a little. She\r\ndid not quite like that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not have\r\nmentioned it. Perhaps there was some pride in the confession,\xe2\x80\x94the pride\r\nof poverty that will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie had been\r\nthe queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving\r\ngreater piquancy to her beauty in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; I am not sure that\r\nthe quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone,\r\nbut assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike other women\r\neven than she had seemed at first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can knit, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif that will be of any use for\r\nyour bazaar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool\r\nto-morrow. But your sister is the most enviable person,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nLucy, turning to Stephen, \xe2\x80\x9cto have the talent of modelling. She is\r\ndoing a wonderful bust of Dr Kenn entirely from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the\r\ncorners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be\r\nstriking in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that is very wicked of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, looking rather hurt. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think you would speak disrespectfully of Dr Kenn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say anything disrespectful of Dr Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not\r\nbound to respect a libellous bust of him. I think Kenn one of the\r\nfinest fellows in the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care much about the tall\r\ncandlesticks he has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nspoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning. But he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe only man I ever knew personally who seems to me to have anything of\r\nthe real apostle in him,\xe2\x80\x94a man who has eight hundred a-year and is\r\ncontented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he gives away\r\ntwo-thirds of his income. That was a very fine thing of him,\xe2\x80\x94taking\r\ninto his house that poor lad Grattan, who shot his mother by accident.\r\nHe sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare, to save the\r\npoor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it. He takes\r\nthe lad out with him constantly, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, who had let her work fall, and was\r\nlistening with keen interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew any one who did such\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStephen, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause his manners in general are rather cold and severe.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing sugary and maudlin about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect character!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with pretty\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; there I can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, shaking his head with\r\nsarcastic gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what fault can you point out in him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an Anglican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, those are the right views, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat settles the question in the abstract,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not\r\nfrom a parliamentary point of view. He has set the Dissenters and the\r\nChurch people by the ears; and a rising senator like myself, of whose\r\nservices the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient\r\nwhen he puts up for the honour of representing St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s in Parliament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, her eyes brightening with a\r\nproud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of\r\nAnglicanism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, whenever old Mr Leyburn\xe2\x80\x99s public spirit and gout induce him\r\nto give way. My father\xe2\x80\x99s heart is set on it; and gifts like mine, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed his large white hands\r\nover his hair with playful self-admiration\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgifts like mine involve\r\ngreat responsibilities. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, Miss Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; \xe2\x80\x9cso much fluency and\r\nself-possession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see how much penetration you have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ndiscovered already that I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial\r\npeople never discern that, owing to my manner, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me when I talk of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, while his\r\nlisteners were laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI must try other subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDid Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next\r\nweek? was the next question. Then followed the recommendation to choose\r\nSouthey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLife of Cowper,\xe2\x80\x9d unless she were inclined to be\r\nphilosophical, and startle the ladies of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s by voting for one of\r\nthe Bridgewater Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these\r\nalarmingly learned books were; and as it is always pleasant to improve\r\nthe minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of which\r\nthey know nothing, Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of\r\nBuckland\xe2\x80\x99s Treatise, which he had just been reading. He was rewarded by\r\nseeing Maggie let her work fall, and gradually get so absorbed in his\r\nwonderful geological story that she sat looking at him, leaning forward\r\nwith crossed arms, and with an entire absence of self-consciousness, as\r\nif he had been the snuffiest of old professors, and she a downy-lipped\r\nalumna. He was so fascinated by the clear, large gaze that at last he\r\nforgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy; but she, sweet\r\nchild, was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever\r\nhe was, and that they would certainly be good friends after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, when\r\nhe found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare many illustrations in it that you will like to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, blushing with returning\r\nself-consciousness at this direct address, and taking up her work\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI must forbid your plunging Maggie in\r\nbooks. I shall never get her away from them; and I want her to have\r\ndelicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and chatting and riding\r\nand driving; that is the holiday she needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApropos!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go out for a\r\nrow on the river now? The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way, and\r\nwe can walk back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since she\r\nhad been on the river. When she was gone to put on her bonnet, Lucy\r\nlingered to give an order to the servant, and took the opportunity of\r\ntelling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip, so that\r\nit was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday. But she\r\nwould write another to-morrow and invite him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call and beat him up to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring him\r\nwith me in the evening, shall I? My sisters will want to call on you\r\nwhen I tell them your cousin is with you. I must leave the field clear\r\nfor them in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, pray bring him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you _will_ like Maggie,\r\nsha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a beseeching tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she a dear,\r\nnoble-looking creature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo tall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, smiling down upon her, \xe2\x80\x9cand a little too\r\nfiery. She is not my type of woman, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent confidences\r\nto ladies concerning their unfavourable opinion of sister fair ones.\r\nThat is why so many women have the advantage of knowing that they are\r\nsecretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to\r\nthem. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of\r\nLucy than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was\r\ndetermined that Maggie should not know it. But you, who have a higher\r\nlogic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as the\r\ndirect sequence to that unfavourable opinion of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, that he\r\nwalked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid of a vivid\r\nimagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in\r\nconsequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who\r\nwishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is\r\nrowing them in a boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this\r\nsurprising daughter of Mrs Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such\r\npassions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love\r\nalready, and half-engaged to the dearest little creature in the world;\r\nand he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way. But when one\r\nis five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one\xe2\x80\x99s finger-ends that\r\nthe touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was\r\nperfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast under such circumstances as the present. And there was really\r\nsomething very interesting about this girl, with her poverty and\r\ntroubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two\r\ncousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had\r\nany peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of\r\na superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women,\r\nwhy, they certainly make a variety in social intercourse.\r\n\r\nMaggie did not fulfil Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s hope by looking at him during the first\r\nquarter of an hour; her eyes were too full of the old banks that she\r\nknew so well. She felt lonely, cut off from Philip,\xe2\x80\x94the only person who\r\nhad ever seemed to love her devotedly, as she had always longed to be\r\nloved. But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her,\r\nand she thought she should like to learn how to row. This roused her\r\nfrom her reverie, and she asked if she might take an oar. It appeared\r\nthat she required much teaching, and she became ambitious. The exercise\r\nbrought the warm blood into her cheeks, and made her inclined to take\r\nher lesson merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you and\r\nLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat.\r\nMaggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she was doing, and she had\r\nchosen an inopportune moment for her remark; her foot slipped, but\r\nhappily Mr Stephen Guest held her hand, and kept her up with a firm\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bending to look\r\nin her face with anxiety. It was very charming to be taken care of in\r\nthat kind, graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself. Maggie had never felt just in the same way before.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated\r\nwith Mrs Tulliver in the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away, asking\r\nleave to come again in the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cI want Maggie to hear your best songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out\r\nwith Lucy, probably to Park House, was much shocked at the shabbiness\r\nof her clothes, which when witnessed by the higher society of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwould be a discredit to the family, that demanded a strong and prompt\r\nremedy; and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this\r\nend from among the superfluities of Mrs Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe was one that\r\nLucy as well as Mrs Tulliver entered into with some zeal. Maggie must\r\nreally have an evening dress as soon as possible, and she was about the\r\nsame height as aunt Pullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s so much broader across the shoulders than I am, it\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nill-convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9celse she might wear that beautiful\r\nblack brocade o\xe2\x80\x99 mine without any alteration; and her arms are beyond\r\neverything,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Pullet, sorrowfully, as she lifted Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge round arm, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d never get my sleeves on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean Maggie to have long sleeves, and I have abundance of black lace\r\nfor trimming. Her arms will look beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s arms _are_ a pretty shape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re like\r\nmine used to be, only mine was never brown; I wish she\xe2\x80\x99d had _our_\r\nfamily skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, aunty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, patting her aunt Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand those things. A painter would think Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplexion beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, submissively. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know better\r\nthan I do. Only when I was young a brown skin wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought well on\r\namong respectable folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet, who took intense interest in the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconversation as he sucked his lozenges. \xe2\x80\x9cThough there was a song about\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Nut-brown Maid\xe2\x80\x99 too; I think she was crazy,\xe2\x80\x94crazy Kate,\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t justly remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\r\nwill be the end of _my_ brown skin, if it is always to be talked about\r\nso much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nConfidential Moments\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie went up to her bedroom that night, it appeared that she was\r\nnot at all inclined to undress. She set down her candle on the first\r\ntable that presented itself, and began to walk up and down her room,\r\nwhich was a large one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid step,\r\nwhich showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong\r\nexcitement. Her eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy; her\r\nhead was thrown backward, and her hands were clasped with the palms\r\noutward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany\r\nmental absorption.\r\n\r\nHad anything remarkable happened?\r\n\r\nNothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree\r\nunimportant. She had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass\r\nvoice,\xe2\x80\x94but then it was sung in a provincial, amateur fashion, such as\r\nwould have left a critical ear much to desire. And she was conscious of\r\nhaving been looked at a great deal, in rather a furtive manner, from\r\nbeneath a pair of well-marked horizontal eyebrows, with a glance that\r\nseemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence of the voice.\r\nSuch things could have had no perceptible effect on a thoroughly\r\nwell-educated young lady, with a perfectly balanced mind, who had had\r\nall the advantages of fortune, training, and refined society. But if\r\nMaggie had been that young lady, you would probably have known nothing\r\nabout her: her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could\r\nhardly have been written; for the happiest women, like the happiest\r\nnations, have no history.\r\n\r\nIn poor Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s highly-strung, hungry nature,\xe2\x80\x94just come away from a\r\nthird-rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of\r\ntasks,\xe2\x80\x94these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and\r\nexalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself. It\r\nwas not that she thought distinctly of Mr Stephen Guest, or dwelt on\r\nthe indications that he looked at her with admiration; it was rather\r\nthat she felt the half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty\r\nand delight, made up of vague, mingled images from all the poetry and\r\nromance she had ever read, or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries.\r\nHer mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she had courted\r\nprivation, when she had thought all longing, all impatience was\r\nsubdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she recoiled\r\nfrom the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving now, would bring\r\nback that negative peace; the battle of her life, it seemed, was not to\r\nbe decided in that short and easy way,\xe2\x80\x94by perfect renunciation at the\r\nvery threshold of her youth.\r\n\r\nThe music was vibrating in her still,\xe2\x80\x94Purcell\xe2\x80\x99s music, with its wild\r\npassion and fancy,\xe2\x80\x94and she could not stay in the recollection of that\r\nbare, lonely past. She was in her brighter aerial world again, when a\r\nlittle tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered\r\nin ample white dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Maggie, you naughty child, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you begun to undress?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLucy, in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised not to come and talk to you, because\r\nI thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking as if you were\r\nready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown and\r\nunplait your hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you_ are not very forward,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Maggie, hastily reaching\r\nher own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s light-brown hair\r\nbrushed back in curly disorder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you till I see\r\nyou are really on the way to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink\r\ndrapery, Lucy sat down near the toilette-table, watching her with\r\naffectionate eyes, and head a little aside, like a pretty spaniel. If\r\nit appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on\r\nto talk confidentially in a situation of this kind, I will beg you to\r\nremember that human life furnishes many exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really _have_ enjoyed the music to-night, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy. I think I\r\nshould have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of\r\nmusic. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs, and ideas into my\r\nbrain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music.\r\nAt other times one is conscious of carrying a weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nlaughing, as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nnot impartial, and _I_ think any barrel-organ splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me what you think of him, now. Tell me exactly; good and bad\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be\r\nso much at ease, and so self-confident. He ought to tremble more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me! You think he is\r\nconceited, I see that. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike him, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDislike him! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people,\r\nthat I should be very difficult to please? Besides, how could I dislike\r\nany one that promised to make you happy, my dear thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie pinched\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s dimpled chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have more music to-morrow evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, looking happy\r\nalready, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lucy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, turning pale. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I\r\ncould not see him without Tom\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Tom such a tyrant as that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the\r\nresponsibility, then,\xe2\x80\x94tell him it was my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, falteringly, \xe2\x80\x9cI promised Tom very solemnly,\r\nbefore my father\xe2\x80\x99s death,\xe2\x80\x94I promised him I would not speak to Philip\r\nwithout his knowledge and consent. And I have a great dread of opening\r\nthe subject with Tom,\xe2\x80\x94of getting into a quarrel with him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm\r\ncan poor Philip have done? May I speak to Tom about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him myself\r\nto-morrow, and tell him that you wish Philip to come. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought\r\nbefore of asking him to absolve me from my promise, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had\r\nthe courage to determine on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she turned to her and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI _should_ like to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must\r\nnot betray that you know it to any one\xe2\x80\x94least of all to Philip himself,\r\nor to Mr Stephen Guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the relief\r\nof such an outpouring; she had never before told Lucy anything of her\r\ninmost life; and the sweet face bent toward her with sympathetic\r\ninterest, and the little hand pressing hers, encouraged her to speak\r\non. On two points only she was not expansive. She did not betray fully\r\nwhat still rankled in her mind as Tom\xe2\x80\x99s great offence,\xe2\x80\x94the insults he\r\nhad heaped on Philip. Angry as the remembrance still made her, she\r\ncould not bear that any one else should know it at all, both for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s. And she could not bear to tell Lucy of the last\r\nscene between her father and Wakem, though it was this scene which she\r\nhad ever since felt to be a new barrier between herself and Philip. She\r\nmerely said, she saw now that Tom was, on the whole, right in regarding\r\nany prospect of love and marriage between her and Philip as put out of\r\nthe question by the relation of the two families. Of course Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather would never consent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Lucy, you have had my story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling, with the\r\ntears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek. _I_ was\r\nadored once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have\r\nlearned so much since you left school; which always seemed to me\r\nwitchcraft before,\xe2\x80\x94part of your general uncanniness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy.\r\n\r\nShe mused a little with her eyes downward, and then added, looking at\r\nMaggie, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very beautiful that you should love Philip; I never\r\nthought such a happiness would befall him. And in my opinion, you ought\r\nnot to give him up. There are obstacles now; but they may be done away\r\nwith in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help being hopeful about it. There\r\nis something romantic in it,\xe2\x80\x94out of the common way,\xe2\x80\x94just what\r\neverything that happens to you ought to be. And Philip will adore you\r\nlike a husband in a fairy tale. Oh, I shall puzzle my small brain to\r\ncontrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind, so\r\nthat you may marry Philip when I marry\xe2\x80\x94somebody else. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be\r\na pretty ending to all my poor, poor Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s troubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she felt a sudden chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear, you are cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to bed; and so must\r\nI. I dare not think what time it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey kissed each other, and Lucy went away, possessed of a confidence\r\nwhich had a strong influence over her subsequent impressions. Maggie\r\nhad been thoroughly sincere; her nature had never found it easy to be\r\notherwise. But confidences are sometimes blinding, even when they are\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nBrother and Sister\r\n\r\nMaggie was obliged to go to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings in the middle of the day,\r\nwhen he would be coming in to dinner, else she would not have found him\r\nat home. He was not lodging with entire strangers. Our friend Bob Jakin\r\nhad, with Mumps\xe2\x80\x99s tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight\r\nmonths ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with\r\nsurprising passages, by the water-side, where, as he observed, his wife\r\nand mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpleasure-boats,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he had invested some of his savings, and by\r\ntaking in a lodger for the parlour and spare bedroom. Under these\r\ncircumstances, what could be better for the interests of all parties,\r\nsanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be Mr Tom?\r\n\r\nIt was Bob\xe2\x80\x99s wife who opened the door to Maggie. She was a tiny woman,\r\nwith the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison\r\nwith Bob\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much\r\nlike one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently\r\nstanding near a colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny woman\r\ncurtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had\r\nopened the door; but the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIs my brother at home?\xe2\x80\x9d which Maggie\r\nuttered smilingly, made her turn round with sudden excitement, and\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mother, mother\xe2\x80\x94tell Bob!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Maggie! Come in, Miss, for\r\ngoodness do,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to\r\nflatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nSad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlour,\r\nwhich was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of \xe2\x80\x9chome,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nname which had once, so many years ago, meant for both of them the same\r\nsum of dear familiar objects. But everything was not strange to her in\r\nthis new room; the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old\r\nBible, and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories. She\r\nstood without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please to take the privilege o\xe2\x80\x99 sitting down, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nJakin, rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then lifting\r\nup the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of\r\nembarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBob is at home, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling at\r\nthe bashful Dutch doll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo and see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Jakin, disappearing.\r\n\r\nBut she presently came back walking with new courage a little way\r\nbehind her husband, who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and\r\nregular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her\r\nhand to him; \xe2\x80\x9cI always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall come\r\nanother day on purpose for that, if she will let me. But I was obliged\r\nto come to-day to speak to my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be in before long, Miss. He\xe2\x80\x99s doin\xe2\x80\x99 finely, Mr Tom is; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99 the first men hereabouts,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bob, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be indebted to you, whatever he becomes; he\r\nsaid so himself only the other night, when he was talking of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Miss, that\xe2\x80\x99s his way o\xe2\x80\x99 takin\xe2\x80\x99 it. But I think the more on\xe2\x80\x99t when\r\nhe says a thing, because his tongue doesn\xe2\x80\x99t overshoot him as mine does.\r\nLors! I\xe2\x80\x99m no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop mysen\r\nwhen once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see\r\nyou. What do you say now, Prissy?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Bob turned to his wife,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit all come true as I said? Though there isn\xe2\x80\x99t many sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 goods as I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t over-praise when I set my tongue to\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Bob\xe2\x80\x99s small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in\r\nturning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile\r\nand curtsey, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d looked forrard like aenything to seein\xe2\x80\x99 you,\r\nMiss, for my husband\xe2\x80\x99s tongue\xe2\x80\x99s been runnin\xe2\x80\x99 on you, like as if he was\r\nlight-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin\xe2\x80\x99 on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, looking rather silly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo an\xe2\x80\x99 see after the\r\ntaters, else Mr Tom \xe2\x80\x99ull have to wait for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs Jakin, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember you used to say he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like your marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, \xe2\x80\x9che made up his mind to\xe2\x80\x99t when he see\xe2\x80\x99d what a\r\nlittle un she was. He pretends not to see her mostly, or else to think\r\nas she isn\xe2\x80\x99t full-growed. But about Mr Tom, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, speaking\r\nlower and looking serious, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s as close as a iron biler, he is; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a \xe2\x80\x99cutish chap, an\xe2\x80\x99 when I\xe2\x80\x99ve left off carrying my pack, an\xe2\x80\x99 am at\r\na loose end, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got more brains nor I know what to do wi\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nforced to busy myself wi\xe2\x80\x99 other folks\xe2\x80\x99s insides. An\xe2\x80\x99 it worrets me as\r\nMr Tom\xe2\x80\x99ll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin\xe2\x80\x99 his brow, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\na-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at the fire of a night. He should be a bit livelier now, a\r\nfine young fellow like him. My wife says, when she goes in sometimes,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin\xe2\x80\x99 into the fire, and\r\nfrownin\xe2\x80\x99 as if he was watchin\xe2\x80\x99 folks at work in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks so much about business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, speaking lower; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 else,\r\nMiss? He\xe2\x80\x99s close, Mr Tom is; but I\xe2\x80\x99m a \xe2\x80\x99cute chap, I am, an\xe2\x80\x99 I thought\r\ntow\xe2\x80\x99rt last Christmas as I\xe2\x80\x99d found out a soft place in him. It was\r\nabout a little black spaniel\xe2\x80\x94a rare bit o\xe2\x80\x99 breed\xe2\x80\x94as he made a fuss to\r\nget. But since then summat\xe2\x80\x99s come over him, as he\xe2\x80\x99s set his teeth\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99 things more nor iver, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s had such good luck. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nwanted to tell _you_, Miss, \xe2\x80\x99cause I thought you might work it out of\r\nhim a bit, now you\xe2\x80\x99re come. He\xe2\x80\x99s a deal too lonely, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go into\r\ncompany enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I have very little power over him, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, a\r\ngood deal moved by Bob\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. It was a totally new idea to her\r\nmind that Tom could have his love troubles. Poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x94and in love\r\nwith Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s too officious\r\nbrain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and\r\ngratitude. But Bob had already said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d and the outer\r\ndoor was opening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no time to spare, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be\r\nhindering you from taking your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was\r\nseated opposite the light. He noticed that she was tremulous, and he\r\nhad a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about. The\r\npresentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her\r\nrequest in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined\r\non. She rose from her seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or\r\nrather, I promised you not to see him without telling you. I am come to\r\ntell you that I wish to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, still more coldly.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner,\r\nbefore she repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for myself, dear Tom. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked it,\r\nonly that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s and she wishes him to\r\ncome, has invited him to come this evening; and I told her I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee him without telling you. I shall only see him in the presence of\r\nother people. There will never be anything secret between us again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a\r\nlittle while. Then he turned to her and said, slowly and emphatically,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need\r\nfor my repeating anything I said a year ago. While my father was\r\nliving, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you\r\nfrom disgracing him as well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must\r\nleave you to your own choice. You wish to be independent; you told me\r\nso after my father\xe2\x80\x99s death. My opinion is not changed. If you think of\r\nPhilip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it would\r\nlead to misery. But I shall soon go away to another situation, and I\r\nshould like to be friends with him again while I am here. Lucy wishes\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe severity of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face relaxed a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you to make a fuss on the subject. But I have no confidence in\r\nyou, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a cruel word. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s lip began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done\r\nand borne everything as well as I could? And I kept my word to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94My life has not been a happy one, any more than yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was\r\nnot angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the\r\nsunshine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her,\r\nas, in old days, it subdued her in the worm-eaten attic. The brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself\r\nin Tom\xe2\x80\x99s fashion. He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the\r\ntone of a kind pedagogue,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me, Maggie. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I mean. You\xe2\x80\x99re always in\r\nextremes; you have no judgment and self-command; and yet you think you\r\nknow best, and will not submit to be guided. You know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish you\r\nto take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good\r\nhome, and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations,\r\nuntil I could have provided a home for you with my mother. And that is\r\nwhat I should like to do. I wished my sister to be a lady, and I always\r\nhave taken care of you, as my father desired, until you were well\r\nmarried. But your ideas and mine never accord, and you will not give\r\nway. Yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother, who goes\r\nout into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows better what is\r\nright and respectable for his sister than she can know herself. You\r\nthink I am not kind; but my kindness can only be directed by what I\r\nbelieve to be good for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know, dear Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying to\r\ncontrol her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you would do a great deal for me; I know how\r\nyou work, and don\xe2\x80\x99t spare yourself. I am grateful to you. But, indeed,\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t quite judge for me; our natures are very different. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how differently things affect me from what they do you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _do_ know; I know it too well. I know how differently you must\r\nfeel about all that affects our family, and your own dignity as a young\r\nwoman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip\r\nWakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should\r\nobject to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s name being associated for a moment with that of a\r\nyoung man whose father must hate the very thought of us all, and would\r\nspurn you. With any one but you, I should think it quite certain that\r\nwhat you witnessed just before my father\xe2\x80\x99s death would secure you from\r\never thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\ncertain of it with you; I never feel certain about anything with _you_.\r\nAt one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self-denial, and at\r\nanother you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible cutting truth in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s words,\xe2\x80\x94that hard rind of\r\ntruth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie\r\nalways writhed under this judgment of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s; she rebelled and was\r\nhumiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before\r\nher to show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic\r\nvoice predicting her future fallings; and yet, all the while, she\r\njudged him in return; she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust,\r\nthat he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the\r\nsource of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her life a planless\r\nriddle to him.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down,\r\nleaning her arm on the table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel\r\nthat she was near to him. He always repelled her. Her feeling under his\r\nwords was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her\r\nfather and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory surmounted\r\nthe immediate grievance. No! She did not think of such things with\r\nfrivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her of that. She looked\r\nup at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say. But I\r\nam not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I\r\nsee as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94not on other grounds\xe2\x80\x94it would be unreasonable, it would be\r\nwrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up\r\nthinking of him as a lover. I am telling you the truth, and you have no\r\nright to disbelieve me; I have kept my word to you, and you have never\r\ndetected me in a falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I should\r\ncarefully avoid, any intercourse with Philip on any other footing than\r\nof quiet friendship. You may think that I am unable to keep my\r\nresolutions; but at least you ought not to treat me with hard contempt\r\non the ground of faults that I have not committed yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, softening under this appeal, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\noverstrain matters. I think, all things considered, it will be best for\r\nyou to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him to come to the house. I\r\nbelieve what you say,\xe2\x80\x94at least you believe it yourself, I know; I can\r\nonly warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little tremor in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s voice as he uttered the last words,\r\nand Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when\r\nthey were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of\r\nconciliation. She rose and laid her hand on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great deal\r\nto bear, and have done a great deal. I should like to be a comfort to\r\nyou, not to vex you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m altogether naughty, now, do\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom smiled at the eager face; his smiles were very pleasant to see when\r\nthey did come, for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may turn out better than you expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I come some day and make tea for you, and see this extremely\r\nsmall wife of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but trot away now, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more time to spare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom,\r\nlooking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to give me a kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom bent to kiss her cheek, and then said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! Be a good girl. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great deal to think of to-day. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to aunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow? We\xe2\x80\x99re going all to dine early,\r\nthat we may go there to tea. You _must_ come; Lucy told me to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pooh! I\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty else to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, pulling his bell\r\nviolently, and bringing down the small bell-rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened; I shall run away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, making a laughing\r\nretreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to\r\nthe farther end of the room; not very far either,\xe2\x80\x94a touch of human\r\nexperience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a\r\nfew substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of\r\ntheir rise in the world, and were cherishing very large hopes in very\r\nsmall lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nShowing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we\xe2\x80\x99ve settled this Newcastle business, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane,\r\nthat same afternoon, as they were seated in the private room at the\r\nBank together, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s another matter I want to talk to you about.\r\nSince you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at\r\nNewcastle for the next few weeks, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want a good prospect of some\r\nsort to keep up your spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this\r\napartment, while his uncle took out his snuff-box and gratified each\r\nnostril with deliberate impartiality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane at last, throwing himself backward, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nworld goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a young\r\nfellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was much such a strapping\r\nyoungster as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts the best\r\npart of his life, before he got the whip in his hand. The looms went\r\nslowish, and fashions didn\xe2\x80\x99t alter quite so fast; I\xe2\x80\x99d a best suit that\r\nlasted me six years. Everything was on a lower scale, sir,\xe2\x80\x94in point of\r\nexpenditure, I mean. It\xe2\x80\x99s this steam, you see, that has made the\r\ndifference; it drives on every wheel double pace, and the wheel of\r\nfortune along with \xe2\x80\x99em, as our Mr Stephen Guest said at the anniversary\r\ndinner (he hits these things off wonderfully, considering he\xe2\x80\x99s seen\r\nnothing of business). I don\xe2\x80\x99t find fault with the change, as some\r\npeople do. Trade, sir, opens a man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; and if the population is to\r\nget thicker upon the ground, as it\xe2\x80\x99s doing, the world must use its wits\r\nat inventions of one sort or other. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my share as an\r\nordinary man of business. Somebody has said it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing to make\r\ntwo ears of corn grow where only one grew before; but, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine\r\nthing, too, to further the exchange of commodities, and bring the\r\ngrains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And that\xe2\x80\x99s our line of\r\nbusiness; and I consider it as honourable a position as a man can hold,\r\nto be connected with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr\r\nDeane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his\r\nreminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of trade. Indeed, for\r\nthe last month or two, there had been hints thrown out to Tom which\r\nenabled him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his\r\nown benefit. With the beginning of the last speech he had stretched out\r\nhis legs, thrust his hands in his pockets, and prepared himself for\r\nsome introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr Deane had\r\nsucceeded by his own merit, and that what he had to say to young men in\r\ngeneral was, that if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed too it was because of their\r\nown demerit. He was rather surprised, then, when his uncle put a direct\r\nquestion to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s going on for seven years now since you applied to me\r\nfor a situation, eh, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m three-and-twenty now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s as well not to say that, though; for you\xe2\x80\x99d pass for a good\r\ndeal older, and age tells well in business. I remember your coming very\r\nwell; I remember I saw there was some pluck in you, and that was what\r\nmade me give you encouragement. And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say I was right; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve done me credit, sir; and if I\xe2\x80\x99d had a son\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 my own, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been sorry to see him like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane tapped his box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of\r\nsome feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been sorry to see him like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you satisfaction, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tom, in his proud, independent way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tom, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me satisfaction. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your conduct\r\nas a son; though that weighs with me in my opinion of you. But what I\r\nhave to do with, as a partner in our firm, is the qualities you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nshown as a man o\xe2\x80\x99 business. Ours is a fine business,\xe2\x80\x94a splendid\r\nconcern, sir,\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on growing;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a growing capital, and growing outlets for it; but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother thing that\xe2\x80\x99s wanted for the prosperity of every concern, large\r\nor small, and that\xe2\x80\x99s men to conduct it,\xe2\x80\x94men of the right habits; none\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 your flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended on. Now this is\r\nwhat Mr Guest and I see clear enough. Three years ago we took Gell into\r\nthe concern; we gave him a share in the oil-mill. And why? Why, because\r\nGell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it will\r\nalways be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near ten\r\nyears older than you, there are other points in your favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was getting a little nervous as Mr Deane went on speaking; he was\r\nconscious of something he had in his mind to say, which might not be\r\nagreeable to his uncle, simply because it was a new suggestion rather\r\nthan an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stands to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Deane went on, when he had finished his new\r\npinch, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your being my nephew weighs in your favour; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny that if you\xe2\x80\x99d been no relation of mine at all, your conduct in\r\nthat affair of Pelley\xe2\x80\x99s bank would have led Mr Guest and myself to make\r\nsome acknowledgment of the service you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to us; and, backed by\r\nyour general conduct and business ability, it has made us determine on\r\ngiving you a share in the business,\xe2\x80\x94a share which we shall be glad to\r\nincrease as the years go on. We think that\xe2\x80\x99ll be better, on all\r\ngrounds, than raising your salary. It\xe2\x80\x99ll give you more importance, and\r\nprepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by\r\nand by. I\xe2\x80\x99m equal to a good deal o\xe2\x80\x99 work at present, thank God; but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngetting older,\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that. I told Mr Guest I would open\r\nthe subject to you; and when you come back from this northern business,\r\nwe can go into particulars. This is a great stride for a young fellow\r\nof three-and-twenty, but I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful to Mr Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the most\r\nindebted to _you_, who first took me into the business, and have taken\r\na good deal of pains with me since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he had said this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t spare pains when I see they\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nof any use. I gave myself some trouble with Gell, else he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen what he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I should like to mention to you uncle. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever spoken to you of it before. If you remember, at the time my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s property was sold, there was some thought of your firm buying\r\nthe Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment,\r\nespecially if steam were applied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure. But Wakem outbid us; he\xe2\x80\x99d made up his mind to\r\nthat. He\xe2\x80\x99s rather fond of carrying everything over other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use my mentioning it at present,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI wish you to know what I have in my mind about the Mill. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a strong\r\nfeeling about it. It was my father\xe2\x80\x99s dying wish that I should try and\r\nget it back again whenever I could; it was in his family for five\r\ngenerations. I promised my father; and besides that, I\xe2\x80\x99m attached to\r\nthe place. I shall never like any other so well. And if it should ever\r\nsuit your views to buy it for the firm, I should have a better chance\r\nof fulfilling my father\xe2\x80\x99s wish. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked to mention the\r\nthing to you, only you\xe2\x80\x99ve been kind enough to say my services have been\r\nof some value. And I\xe2\x80\x99d give up a much greater chance in life for the\r\nsake of having the Mill again,\xe2\x80\x94I mean having it in my own hands, and\r\ngradually working off the price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a while; \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing would be possible if\r\nthere were any chance of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s parting with the property. But that I\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ see. He\xe2\x80\x99s put that young Jetsome in the place; and he had his\r\nreasons when he bought it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a loose fish, that young Jetsome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taking to\r\ndrinking, and they say he\xe2\x80\x99s letting the business go down. Luke told me\r\nabout it,\xe2\x80\x94our old miller. He says he sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t stay unless there\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nalteration. I was thinking, if things went on that way, Wakem might be\r\nmore willing to part with the Mill. Luke says he\xe2\x80\x99s getting very sour\r\nabout the way things are going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over, Tom. I must inquire into the matter, and go\r\ninto it with Mr Guest. But, you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather striking out a new\r\nbranch, and putting you to that, instead of keeping you where you are,\r\nwhich was what we\xe2\x80\x99d wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once\r\nset properly going, sir. I want to have plenty of work. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nelse I care about much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of\r\nthree-and-twenty, even in uncle Deane\xe2\x80\x99s business-loving ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh! you\xe2\x80\x99ll be having a wife to care about one of these days,\r\nif you get on at this pace in the world. But as to this Mill, we\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t reckon on our chickens too early. However, I promise you to\r\nbear it in mind, and when you come back we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of it again. I am\r\ngoing to dinner now. Come and breakfast with us to-morrow morning, and\r\nsay good-bye to your mother and sister before you start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the Laws of Attraction\r\n\r\nIt is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her\r\nlife which must be considered by all prudent persons as a great\r\nopportunity for a young woman. Launched into the higher society of St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, with a striking person, which had the advantage of being quite\r\nunfamiliar to the majority of beholders, and with such moderate\r\nassistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed in Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s anxious\r\ncolloquy with aunt Pullet, Maggie was certainly at a new starting-point\r\nin life. At Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s first evening party, young Torry fatigued his facial\r\nmuscles more than usual in order that \xe2\x80\x9cthe dark-eyed girl there in the\r\ncorner\xe2\x80\x9d might see him in all the additional style conferred by his\r\neyeglass; and several young ladies went home intending to have short\r\nsleeves with black lace, and to plait their hair in a broad coronet at\r\nthe back of their head,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat cousin of Miss Deane\xe2\x80\x99s looked so very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, poor Maggie, with all her inward consciousness of a\r\npainful past and her presentiment of a troublous future, was on the way\r\nto become an object of some envy,\xe2\x80\x94a topic of discussion in the newly\r\nestablished billiard-room, and between fair friends who had no secrets\r\nfrom each other on the subject of trimmings. The Miss Guests, who\r\nassociated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s, and were the glass of fashion there, took some exception to\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s manners. She had a way of not assenting at once to the\r\nobservations current in good society, and of saying that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether those observations were true or not, which gave her an air\r\nof _gaucherie_, and impeded the even flow of conversation; but it is a\r\nfact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the worst\r\ndisposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has\r\npoints of inferiority. And Maggie was so entirely without those pretty\r\nairs of coquetry which have the traditional reputation of driving\r\ngentlemen to despair that she won some feminine pity for being so\r\nineffective in spite of her beauty. She had not had many advantages,\r\npoor thing! and it must be admitted there was no pretension about her;\r\nher abruptness and unevenness of manner were plainly the result of her\r\nsecluded and lowly circumstances. It was only a wonder that there was\r\nno tinge of vulgarity about her, considering what the rest of poor\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s relations were\xe2\x80\x94an allusion which always made the Miss Guests\r\nshudder a little. It was not agreeable to think of any connection by\r\nmarriage with such people as the Gleggs and the Pullets; but it was of\r\nno use to contradict Stephen when once he had set his mind on anything,\r\nand certainly there was no possible objection to Lucy in herself,\xe2\x80\x94no\r\none could help liking her. She would naturally desire that the Miss\r\nGuests should behave kindly to this cousin of whom she was so fond, and\r\nStephen would make a great fuss if they were deficient in civility.\r\nUnder these circumstances the invitations to Park House were not\r\nwanting; and elsewhere, also, Miss Deane was too popular and too\r\ndistinguished a member of society in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s for any attention toward\r\nher to be neglected.\r\n\r\nThus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nand knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative\r\nreason for doing one thing more than another. This new sense of leisure\r\nand unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing airs and\r\ngarden-scents of advancing spring\xe2\x80\x94amidst the new abundance of music,\r\nand lingering strolls in the sunshine, and the delicious dreaminess of\r\ngliding on the river\xe2\x80\x94could hardly be without some intoxicating effect\r\non her, after her years of privation; and even in the first week Maggie\r\nbegan to be less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations. Life\r\nwas certainly very pleasant just now; it was becoming very pleasant to\r\ndress in the evening, and to feel that she was one of the beautiful\r\nthings of this spring-time. And there were admiring eyes always\r\nawaiting her now; she was no longer an unheeded person, liable to be\r\nchid, from whom attention was continually claimed, and on whom no one\r\nfelt bound to confer any. It was pleasant, too, when Stephen and Lucy\r\nwere gone out riding, to sit down at the piano alone, and find that the\r\nold fitness between her fingers and the keys remained, and revived,\r\nlike a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation; to get the\r\ntunes she had heard the evening before, and repeat them again and again\r\nuntil she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a\r\nmore pregnant, passionate language to her. The mere concord of octaves\r\nwas a delight to Maggie, and she would often take up a book of studies\r\nrather than any melody, that she might taste more keenly by abstraction\r\nthe more primitive sensation of intervals. Not that her enjoyment of\r\nmusic was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent; it was\r\nrather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only\r\none form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole\r\nnature, and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other; made\r\nher affections sometimes an impatient demand, but also prevented her\r\nvanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device, and\r\ngave it the poetry of ambition. But you have known Maggie a long while,\r\nand need to be told, not her characteristics, but her history, which is\r\na thing hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of\r\ncharacteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely\r\nfrom within. \xe2\x80\x9cCharacter,\xe2\x80\x9d says Novalis, in one of his questionable\r\naphorisms,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccharacter is destiny.\xe2\x80\x9d But not the whole of our destiny.\r\nHamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and irresolute, and we have\r\na great tragedy in consequence. But if his father had lived to a good\r\nold age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can conceive\r\nHamlet\xe2\x80\x99s having married Ophelia, and got through life with a reputation\r\nof sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody sarcasms\r\ntoward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the frankest\r\nincivility to his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it\r\nto reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river; we only know\r\nthat the river is full and rapid, and that for all rivers there is the\r\nsame final home. Under the charm of her new pleasures, Maggie herself\r\nwas ceasing to think, with her eager prefiguring imagination, of her\r\nfuture lot; and her anxiety about her first interview with Philip was\r\nlosing its predominance; perhaps, unconsciously to herself, she was not\r\nsorry that the interview had been deferred.\r\n\r\nFor Philip had not come the evening he was expected, and Mr Stephen\r\nGuest brought word that he was gone to the coast,\xe2\x80\x94probably, he thought,\r\non a sketching expedition; but it was not certain when he would return.\r\nIt was just like Philip, to go off in that way without telling any one.\r\nIt was not until the twelfth day that he returned, to find both Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotes awaiting him; he had left before he knew of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the\r\nfeelings that were crowded for Maggie into those twelve days; of the\r\nlength to which they were stretched for her by the novelty of her\r\nexperience in them, and the varying attitudes of her mind. The early\r\ndays of an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us, and\r\nfill up a larger space in our memory than longer subsequent periods,\r\nwhich have been less filled with discovery and new impressions. There\r\nwere not many hours in those ten days in which Mr Stephen Guest was not\r\nseated by Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s side, or standing near her at the piano, or\r\naccompanying her on some outdoor excursion; his attentions were clearly\r\nbecoming more assiduous, and that was what every one had expected. Lucy\r\nwas very happy, all the happier because Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s society seemed to\r\nhave become much more interesting and amusing since Maggie had been\r\nthere. Playful discussions\xe2\x80\x94sometimes serious ones\xe2\x80\x94were going forward,\r\nin which both Stephen and Maggie revealed themselves, to the admiration\r\nof the gentle, unobtrusive Lucy; and it more than once crossed her mind\r\nwhat a charming quartet they should have through life when Maggie\r\nmarried Philip. Is it an inexplicable thing that a girl should enjoy\r\nher lover\xe2\x80\x99s society the more for the presence of a third person, and be\r\nwithout the slightest spasm of jealousy that the third person had the\r\nconversation habitually directed to her? Not when that girl is as\r\ntranquil-hearted as Lucy, thoroughly possessed with a belief that she\r\nknows the state of her companions\xe2\x80\x99 affections, and not prone to the\r\nfeelings which shake such a belief in the absence of positive evidence\r\nagainst it. Besides, it was Lucy by whom Stephen sat, to whom he gave\r\nhis arm, to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree with him; and\r\nevery day there was the same tender politeness toward her, the same\r\nconsciousness of her wants and care to supply them. Was there really\r\nthe same? It seemed to Lucy that there was more; and it was no wonder\r\nthat the real significance of the change escaped her. It was a subtle\r\nact of conscience in Stephen that even he himself was not aware of. His\r\npersonal attentions to Maggie were comparatively slight, and there had\r\neven sprung up an apparent distance between them, that prevented the\r\nrenewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had fallen\r\nthe first day in the boat. If Stephen came in when Lucy was out of the\r\nroom, if Lucy left them together, they never spoke to each other;\r\nStephen, perhaps, seemed to be examining books or music, and Maggie\r\nbent her head assiduously over her work. Each was oppressively\r\nconscious of the other\xe2\x80\x99s presence, even to the finger-ends. Yet each\r\nlooked and longed for the same thing to happen the next day. Neither of\r\nthem had begun to reflect on the matter, or silently to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cTo what\r\ndoes all this tend?\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie only felt that life was revealing something\r\nquite new to her; and she was absorbed in the direct, immediate\r\nexperience, without any energy left for taking account of it and\r\nreasoning about it. Stephen wilfully abstained from self-questioning,\r\nand would not admit to himself that he felt an influence which was to\r\nhave any determining effect on his conduct. And when Lucy came into the\r\nroom again, they were once more unconstrained; Maggie could contradict\r\nStephen, and laugh at him, and he could recommend to her consideration\r\nthe example of that most charming heroine, Miss Sophia Western, who had\r\na great \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the understandings of men.\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie could look at\r\nStephen, which, for some reason or other she always avoided when they\r\nwere alone; and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for\r\nhim, since Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were so busy with that bazaar-work, and\r\nlecture her on hurrying the tempo, which was certainly Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s weak\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nOne day\xe2\x80\x94it was the day of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s return\xe2\x80\x94Lucy had formed a sudden\r\nengagement to spend the evening with Mrs Kenn, whose delicate state of\r\nhealth, threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack of\r\nbronchitis, obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar\r\ninto the hands of other ladies, of whom she wished Lucy to be one. The\r\nengagement had been formed in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and he had heard Lucy\r\npromise to dine early and call at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock for Miss Torry, who\r\nbrought Mrs Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen\r\nburst forth, as soon as Miss Torry had left the room,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctaking young\r\nladies from the duties of the domestic hearth into scenes of\r\ndissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered reticules! I should like to\r\nknow what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons\r\nfor husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors\r\nto go out. If this goes on much longer, the bonds of society will be\r\ndissolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it will not go on much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nbazaar is to take place on Monday week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cKenn himself said the other day that he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like this plan of making vanity do the work of charity; but just\r\nas the British public is not reasonable enough to bear direct taxation,\r\nso St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s has not got force of motive enough to build and endow\r\nschools without calling in the force of folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said little Lucy, her hazel eyes opening wide with\r\nanxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard him say anything of that kind; I thought he\r\napproved of what we were doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure he approves _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, smiling at her\r\naffectionately; \xe2\x80\x9cyour conduct in going out to-night looks vicious, I\r\nown, but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you think too well of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, shaking her head, with a\r\npretty blush, and there the subject ended. But it was tacitly\r\nunderstood that Stephen would not come in the evening; and on the\r\nstrength of that tacit understanding he made his morning visit the\r\nlonger, not saying good-bye until after four.\r\n\r\nMaggie was seated in the drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner,\r\nwith Minny on her lap, having left her uncle to his wine and his nap,\r\nand her mother to the compromise between knitting and nodding, which,\r\nwhen there was no company, she always carried on in the dining-room\r\ntill tea-time. Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet, and\r\ncomforting him for his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s absence, when the sound of a footstep\r\non the gravel made her look up, and she saw Mr Stephen Guest walking up\r\nthe garden, as if he had come straight from the river. It was very\r\nunusual to see him so soon after dinner! He often complained that their\r\ndinner-hour was late at Park House. Nevertheless, there he was, in his\r\nblack dress; he had evidently been home, and must have come again by\r\nthe river. Maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating; it was\r\nnatural she should be nervous, for she was not accustomed to receive\r\nvisitors alone. He had seen her look up through the open window, and\r\nraised his hat as he walked toward it, to enter that way instead of by\r\nthe door. He blushed too, and certainly looked as foolish as a young\r\nman of some wit and self-possession can be expected to look, as he\r\nwalked in with a roll of music in his hand, and said, with an air of\r\nhesitating improvisation,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are surprised to see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to apologise\r\nfor coming upon you by surprise, but I wanted to come into the town,\r\nand I got our man to row me; so I thought I would bring these things\r\nfrom the \xe2\x80\x98Maid of Artois\xe2\x80\x99 for your cousin; I forgot them this morning.\r\nWill you give them to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her arms,\r\nand now, not quite knowing what else to do, sat down again.\r\n\r\nStephen laid down his hat, with the music, which rolled on the floor,\r\nand sat down in the chair close by her. He had never done so before,\r\nand both he and Maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you pampered minion!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, leaning to pull the long\r\ncurly ears that drooped over Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s arm. It was not a suggestive\r\nremark, and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development,\r\nit naturally left the conversation at a standstill. It seemed to\r\nStephen like some action in a dream that he was obliged to do, and\r\nwonder at himself all the while,\xe2\x80\x94to go on stroking Minny\xe2\x80\x99s head. Yet it\r\nwas very pleasant; he only wished he dared look at Maggie, and that she\r\nwould look at him,\xe2\x80\x94let him have one long look into those deep, strange\r\neyes of hers, and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after\r\nthat. He thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him, to want\r\nthat long look from Maggie; and he was racking his invention\r\ncontinually to find out some means by which he could have it without\r\nits appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment. As for\r\nMaggie, she had no distinct thought, only the sense of a presence like\r\nthat of a closely hovering broad-winged bird in the darkness, for she\r\nwas unable to look up, and saw nothing but Minny\xe2\x80\x99s black wavy coat.\r\n\r\nBut this must end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only\r\n_seemed_ long, as a minute\xe2\x80\x99s dream does. Stephen at last sat upright\r\nsideways in his chair, leaning one hand and arm over the back and\r\nlooking at Maggie. What should he say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a splendid sunset, I think; sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you go out and see\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. Then courageously raising her eyes and\r\nlooking out of the window, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing cribbage with my uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause; during which Minny is stroked again, but has sufficient\r\ninsight not to be grateful for it, to growl rather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like sitting alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA rather arch look came over Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, and, just glancing at\r\nStephen, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be quite civil to say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStephen, delighted with that glance, and getting determined to stay for\r\nanother. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I\r\nam gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cI know Mr Deane never comes\r\nin till half-past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause, during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window,\r\ntill by a great effort she moved her head to look down at Minny\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\nagain, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a new voice to-morrow night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\ntell your cousin that our friend Philip Wakem is come back? I saw him\r\nas I went home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie gave a little start,\xe2\x80\x94it seemed hardly more than a vibration that\r\npassed from head to foot in an instant. But the new images summoned by\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s name dispersed half the oppressive spell she had been under.\r\nShe rose from her chair with a sudden resolution, and laying Minny on\r\nhis cushion, went to reach Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s large work-basket from its corner.\r\nStephen was vexed and disappointed; he thought perhaps Maggie didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her in that abrupt way, for\r\nhe now recalled what Lucy had told him of the family quarrel. It was of\r\nno use to stay any longer. Maggie was seating herself at the table with\r\nher work, and looking chill and proud; and he\xe2\x80\x94he looked like a\r\nsimpleton for having come. A gratuitous, entirely superfluous visit of\r\nthat sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous. Of course\r\nit was palpable to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s thinking that he had dined hastily in his\r\nown room for the sake of setting off again and finding her alone.\r\n\r\nA boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of\r\nfive-and-twenty, not without legal knowledge! But a reference to\r\nhistory, perhaps, may make it not incredible.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground,\r\nand she started up to reach it. Stephen rose too, and picking up the\r\nball, met her with a vexed, complaining look that gave his eyes quite a\r\nnew expression to Maggie, whose own eyes met them as he presented the\r\nball to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching\r\ndiscontent as his eyes. He dared not put out his hand; he thrust both\r\nhands into his tail-pockets as he spoke. Maggie thought she had perhaps\r\nbeen rude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you stay?\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly, not looking away, for that would\r\nhave seemed rude again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, looking still into the half-unwilling,\r\nhalf-fascinated eyes, as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the\r\ndistant brook. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boat is waiting for me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I brought the music, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Philip is come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d (Maggie did not notice Philip\xe2\x80\x99s name this time.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come out a little way into the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, in a\r\nstill gentler tone; but the next moment he was vexed that she did not\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d for she moved away now toward the open window, and he was\r\nobliged to take his hat and walk by her side. But he thought of\r\nsomething to make him amends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo take my arm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.\r\n\r\nThere is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the\r\nfirm arm; the help is not wanted physically at that moment, but the\r\nsense of help, the presence of strength that is outside them and yet\r\ntheirs, meets a continual want of the imagination. Either on that\r\nground or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they walked together\r\nround the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums, in\r\nthe same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without yet\r\nperceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and\r\nMaggie had darting thoughts across the dimness,\xe2\x80\x94how came he to be\r\nthere? Why had she come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had been,\r\neach would have been less intensely conscious of the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of this step,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will go in now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, feeling that the step had come\r\nlike a rescue. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant she had withdrawn her arm, and was running back to the\r\nhouse. She did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to\r\nthe embarrassing recollections of the last half-hour. She had no\r\nthought left for that. She only threw herself into the low arm-chair,\r\nand burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, Philip, I wish we were together again\xe2\x80\x94so quietly\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nRed Deeps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen looked after her a moment, then went on to the boat, and was\r\nsoon landed at the wharf. He spent the evening in the billiard-room,\r\nsmoking one cigar after another, and losing \xe2\x80\x9clives\xe2\x80\x9d at pool. But he\r\nwould not leave off. He was determined not to think,\xe2\x80\x94not to admit any\r\nmore distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual\r\npresence of Maggie. He was looking at her, and she was on his arm.\r\n\r\nBut there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight, and\r\nwith it the necessity of cursing his own folly, and bitterly\r\ndetermining that he would never trust himself alone with Maggie again.\r\nIt was all madness; he was in love, thoroughly attached to Lucy, and\r\nengaged,\xe2\x80\x94engaged as strongly as an honourable man need be. He wished he\r\nhad never seen this Maggie Tulliver, to be thrown into a fever by her\r\nin this way; she would make a sweet, strange, troublesome, adorable\r\nwife to some man or other, but he would never have chosen her himself.\r\nDid she feel as he did? He hoped she did\xe2\x80\x94not. He ought not to have\r\ngone. He would master himself in future. He would make himself\r\ndisagreeable to her, quarrel with her perhaps. Quarrel with her? Was it\r\npossible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes,\xe2\x80\x94defying and\r\ndeprecating, contradicting and clinging, imperious and beseeching,\xe2\x80\x94full\r\nof delicious opposites? To see such a creature subdued by love for one\r\nwould be a lot worth having\xe2\x80\x94to another man.\r\n\r\nThere was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as\r\nStephen threw away the end of his last cigar, and thrusting his hands\r\ninto his pockets, stalked along at a quieter pace through the\r\nshrubbery. It was not of a benedictory kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nPhilip Re-enters\r\n\r\nThe next morning was very wet,\xe2\x80\x94the sort of morning on which male\r\nneighbours who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay\r\ntheir fair friends an illimitable visit. The rain, which has been\r\nendurable enough for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so\r\nheavy, and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by, that\r\nnothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit; latent\r\ndetestation will not do at all. And if people happen to be lovers, what\r\ncan be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning? English sunshine\r\nis dubious; bonnets are never quite secure; and if you sit down on the\r\ngrass, it may lead to catarrhs. But the rain is to be depended on. You\r\ngallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find yourself in the\r\nseat you like best,\xe2\x80\x94a little above or a little below the one on which\r\nyour goddess sits (it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind, and\r\nthat is the reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down\r\nupon), with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no\r\nlady-callers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStephen will come earlier this morning, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9che always\r\ndoes when it\xe2\x80\x99s rainy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie made no answer. She was angry with Stephen; she began to think\r\nshe should dislike him; and if it had not been for the rain, she would\r\nhave gone to her aunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s this morning, and so have avoided him\r\naltogether. As it was, she must find some reason for remaining out of\r\nthe room with her mother.\r\n\r\nBut Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nnearer neighbour\xe2\x80\x94who preceded him. When Philip entered the room, he was\r\ngoing merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their acquaintance was a\r\nsecret which he was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward\r\nhim and put out her hand, he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken\r\ninto her confidence. It was a moment of some agitation to both, though\r\nPhilip had spent many hours in preparing for it; but like all persons\r\nwho have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy, he\r\nseldom lost his self-control, and shrank with the most sensitive pride\r\nfrom any noticeable betrayal of emotion. A little extra paleness, a\r\nlittle tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the voice pitched in\r\nrather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold\r\nindifference, were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama\r\nthat was not without its fierceness. But Maggie, who had little more\r\npower of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been\r\nconstructed of musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears\r\nas they took each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands in silence. They were not painful\r\ntears; they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women\r\nand children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and\r\nlook back on the threatened danger. For Philip, who a little while ago\r\nwas associated continually in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s mind with the sense that Tom\r\nmight reproach her with some justice, had now, in this short space,\r\nbecome a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might fly to for\r\nrescue and strength. Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with\r\nits root deep down in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet\r\ntalk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first\r\ninstinctive bias,\xe2\x80\x94the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to\r\nher pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic\r\nexcitability of her nature,\xe2\x80\x94seemed now to make a sort of sacred place,\r\na sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence\r\nwhich the best part of herself must resist; which must bring horrible\r\ntumult within, wretchedness without. This new sense of her relation to\r\nPhilip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt,\r\nlest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that Tom\r\nwould sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the tears in\r\nher eyes without any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was\r\njust what Lucy expected, and her kind heart delighted in bringing\r\nPhilip and Maggie together again; though, even with all _her_ regard\r\nfor Philip, she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had\r\nsome excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the\r\ntwo,\xe2\x80\x94a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t like poetry and fairy\r\ntales. But she began to speak as soon as possible, to set them at ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was very good and virtuous of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her pretty\r\ntreble, like the low conversational notes of little birds, \xe2\x80\x9cto come so\r\nsoon after your arrival. And as it is, I think I will pardon you for\r\nrunning away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no\r\nnotice. Come and sit down here,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, placing the chair that\r\nwould suit him best, \xe2\x80\x9cand you shall find yourself treated mercifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never govern well, Miss Deane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, as he seated\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause no one will ever believe in your severity. People\r\nwill always encourage themselves in misdemeanours by the certainty that\r\nyou will be indulgent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it\r\nwas, for he had naturally turned toward Maggie, and she was looking at\r\nhim with that open, affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend\r\nfrom whom we have been long separated. What a moment their parting had\r\nbeen! And Philip felt as if he were only in the morrow of it. He felt\r\nthis so keenly,\xe2\x80\x94with such intense, detailed remembrance, with such\r\npassionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last\r\nconversation,\xe2\x80\x94that with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident\r\nnatures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling, he thought\r\nhe read in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s glance and manner the evidence of a change. The\r\nvery fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to make\r\nthis thought rush in, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am having a great holiday, am I not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cLucy is like a\r\nfairy godmother; she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no\r\ntime. I do nothing but indulge myself all day long, and she always\r\nfinds out what I want before I know it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she is the happier for having you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her. And you look\r\nwell. You are benefiting by the change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArtificial conversation of this sort went on a little while, till Lucy,\r\ndetermined to put an end to it, exclaimed, with a good imitation of\r\nannoyance, that she had forgotten something, and was quickly out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward, and the hands were\r\nclasped again, with a look of sad contentment, like that of friends who\r\nmeet in the memory of recent sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told my brother I wished to see you, Philip; I asked him to release\r\nme from my promise, and he consented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, in her impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at once the\r\nposition they must hold toward each other; but she checked herself. The\r\nthings that had happened since he had spoken of his love for her were\r\nso painful that she shrank from being the first to allude to them. It\r\nseemed almost like an injury toward Philip even to mention her\r\nbrother,\xe2\x80\x94her brother, who had insulted him. But he was thinking too\r\nentirely of her to be sensitive on any other point at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we can at least be friends, Maggie? There is nothing to hinder\r\nthat now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill not your father object?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, withdrawing her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not give you up on any ground but your own wish, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip, colouring. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are points on which I should always\r\nresist my father, as I used to tell you. _That_ is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is nothing to hinder our being friends, Philip,\xe2\x80\x94seeing each\r\nother and talking to each other while I am here; I shall soon go away\r\nagain. I mean to go very soon, to a new situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that inevitable, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I must not stay here long. It would unfit me for the life I must\r\nbegin again at last. I can\xe2\x80\x99t live in dependence,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t live with my\r\nbrother, though he is very good to me. He would like to provide for me;\r\nbut that would be intolerable to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent a few moments, and then said, in that high, feeble\r\nvoice which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no other alternative, Maggie? Is that life, away from those\r\nwho love you, the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at him pleadingly, as if she entreated\r\nhim to believe that she was compelled to this course. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, as\r\nthings are; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may be in years to come. But I begin to\r\nthink there can never come much happiness to me from loving; I have\r\nalways had so much pain mingled with it. I wish I could make myself a\r\nworld outside it, as men do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are returning to your old thought in a new form, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nthought I used to combat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with a slight tinge of\r\nbitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be\r\nan escape from pain. I tell you again, there is no such escape possible\r\nexcept by perverting or mutilating one\xe2\x80\x99s nature. What would become of\r\nme, if I tried to escape from pain? Scorn and cynicism would be my only\r\nopium; unless I could fall into some kind of conceited madness, and\r\nfancy myself a favourite of Heaven because I am not a favourite with\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on\r\nspeaking; the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling\r\nof his own, as well as an answer to Maggie. There was a pain pressing\r\non him at that moment. He shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest\r\nallusion to the words of love, of plighted love that had passed between\r\nthem. It would have seemed to him like reminding Maggie of a promise;\r\nit would have had for him something of the baseness of compulsion. He\r\ncould not dwell on the fact that he himself had not changed; for that\r\ntoo would have had the air of an appeal. His love for Maggie was\r\nstamped, even more than the rest of his experience, with the\r\nexaggerated sense that he was an exception,\xe2\x80\x94that she, that every one,\r\nsaw him in the light of an exception.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie was conscience-stricken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her childish contrition when he used to\r\nchide her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right, I know. I do always think too much of my own\r\nfeelings, and not enough of others\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94not enough of yours. I had need\r\nhave you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many things have\r\ncome true that you used to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was resting her elbow on the table, leaning her head on her hand\r\nand looking at Philip with half-penitent dependent affection, as she\r\nsaid this; while he was returning her gaze with an expression that, to\r\nher consciousness, gradually became less vague,\xe2\x80\x94became charged with a\r\nspecific recollection. Had his mind flown back to something that _she_\r\nnow remembered,\xe2\x80\x94something about a lover of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s? It was a thought\r\nthat made her shudder; it gave new definiteness to her present\r\nposition, and to the tendency of what had happened the evening before.\r\nShe moved her arm from the table, urged to change her position by that\r\npositive physical oppression at the heart that sometimes accompanies a\r\nsudden mental pang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Maggie? Has something happened?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip said, in\r\ninexpressible anxiety, his imagination being only too ready to weave\r\neverything that was fatal to them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rousing her latent will. Philip must not\r\nhave that odious thought in his mind; she would banish it from her own.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in my own mind. You used to say I\r\nshould feel the effect of my starved life, as you called it; and I do.\r\nI am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries, now they are\r\ncome to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up her work and occupied herself resolutely, while Philip\r\nwatched her, really in doubt whether she had anything more than this\r\ngeneral allusion in her mind. It was quite in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s character to be\r\nagitated by vague self-reproach. But soon there came a violent\r\nwell-known ring at the door-bell resounding through the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a startling announcement!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, quite mistress of\r\nherself, though not without some inward flutter. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where Lucy\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy had not been deaf to the signal, and after an interval long enough\r\nfor a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries, she herself ushered\r\nStephen in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, going straight up to Philip and shaking\r\nhim heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s glorious\r\nto have you back again; only I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d conduct yourself a little\r\nless like a sparrow with a residence on the house-top, and not go in\r\nand out constantly without letting the servants know. This is about the\r\ntwentieth time I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to scamper up those countless stairs to that\r\npainting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people thought\r\nyou were at home. Such incidents embitter friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve so few visitors, it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of\r\nmy exit and entrances,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, feeling rather oppressed just then\r\nby Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s bright strong presence and strong voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite well this morning, Miss Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, turning\r\nto Maggie with stiff politeness, and putting out his hand with the air\r\nof fulfilling a social duty.\r\n\r\nMaggie gave the tips of her fingers, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a tone of proud indifference. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were watching them\r\nkeenly; but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each\r\nother, and only thought with regret that there was some natural\r\nantipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual good-will.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie is not the sort of woman Stephen admires, and she is irritated\r\nby something in him which she interprets as conceit,\xe2\x80\x9d was the silent\r\nobservation that accounted for everything to guileless Lucy. Stephen\r\nand Maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each felt\r\nhurt by the other\xe2\x80\x99s coldness. And Stephen, while rattling on in\r\nquestions to Philip about his recent sketching expedition, was thinking\r\nall the more about Maggie because he was not drawing her into the\r\nconversation as he had invariably done before. \xe2\x80\x9cMaggie and Philip are\r\nnot looking happy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cthis first interview has been\r\nsaddening to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we people who have not been galloping,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Stephen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care all a little damped by the rain. Let us have some music. We ought\r\nto take advantage of having Philip and you together. Give us the duet\r\nin \xe2\x80\x98Masaniello\xe2\x80\x99; Maggie has not heard that, and I know it will suit\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, going toward the piano, and giving a\r\nforetaste of the tune in his deep \xe2\x80\x9cbrum-brum,\xe2\x80\x9d very pleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, please, Philip,\xe2\x80\x94you play the accompaniment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cand then\r\nI can go on with my work. You _will_ like to play, sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, with a pretty, inquiring look, anxious, as usual, lest she\r\nshould have proposed what was not pleasant to another; but with\r\nyearnings toward her unfinished embroidery.\r\n\r\nPhilip had brightened at the proposition, for there is no feeling,\r\nperhaps, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find\r\nrelief in music,\xe2\x80\x94that does not make a man sing or play the better; and\r\nPhilip had an abundance of pent-up feeling at this moment, as complex\r\nas any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy\r\nand resignation and fierce suspicion, all at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, seating himself at the piano, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a way of eking\r\nout one\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect life and being three people at once,\xe2\x80\x94to sing and\r\nmake the piano sing, and hear them both all the while,\xe2\x80\x94or else to sing\r\nand paint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there you are an enviable fellow. I can do nothing with my hands,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cThat has generally been observed in men of great\r\nadministrative capacity, I believe,\xe2\x80\x94a tendency to predominance of the\r\nreflective powers in me! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you observed that, Miss Tulliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to\r\nMaggie, and she could not repress the answering flush and epigram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ observed a tendency to predominance,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling; and\r\nPhilip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cmusic, music! We will discuss each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nqualities another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie always tried in vain to go on with her work when music began.\r\nShe tried harder than ever to-day; for the thought that Stephen knew\r\nhow much she cared for his singing was one that no longer roused a\r\nmerely playful resistance; and she knew, too, that it was his habit\r\nalways to stand so that he could look at her. But it was of no use; she\r\nsoon threw her work down, and all her intentions were lost in the vague\r\nstate of emotion produced by the inspiring duet,\xe2\x80\x94emotion that seemed to\r\nmake her at once strong and weak; strong for all enjoyment, weak for\r\nall resistance. When the strain passed into the minor, she half started\r\nfrom her seat with the sudden thrill of that change. Poor Maggie! She\r\nlooked very beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way by\r\nthe inexorable power of sound. You might have seen the slightest\r\nperceptible quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a little\r\nforward, clasping her hands as if to steady herself; while her eyes\r\ndilated and brightened into that wide-open, childish expression of\r\nwondering delight which always came back in her happiest moments. Lucy,\r\nwho at other times had always been at the piano when Maggie was looking\r\nin this way, could not resist the impulse to steal up to her and kiss\r\nher. Philip, too, caught a glimpse of her now and then round the open\r\nbook on the desk, and felt that he had never before seen her under so\r\nstrong an influence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore, more!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, when the duet had been encored. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething\r\nspirited again. Maggie always says she likes a great rush of sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be \xe2\x80\x98Let us take the road,\xe2\x80\x99 then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso suitable\r\nfor a wet morning. But are you prepared to abandon the most sacred\r\nduties of life, and come and sing with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will look out the \xe2\x80\x98Beggar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nOpera\xe2\x80\x99 from the large canterbury. It has a dingy cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a great clue, considering there are about a score covers here\r\nof rival dinginess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, drawing out the canterbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, play something the while, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, noticing that his\r\nfingers were wandering over the keys. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that you are falling\r\ninto?\xe2\x80\x94something delicious that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, bringing out the tune more\r\ndefinitely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s from the \xe2\x80\x98Sonnambula\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Ah! perch\xc3\xa8 non posso odiarti.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the opera, but it appears the tenor is telling the heroine\r\nthat he shall always love her though she may forsake him. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nme sing it to the English words, \xe2\x80\x98I love thee still.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not quite unintentionally that Philip had wandered into this\r\nsong, which might be an indirect expression to Maggie of what he could\r\nnot prevail on himself to say to her directly. Her ears had been open\r\nto what he was saying, and when he began to sing, she understood the\r\nplaintive passion of the music. That pleading tenor had no very fine\r\nqualities as a voice, but it was not quite new to her; it had sung to\r\nher by snatches, in a subdued way, among the grassy walks and hollows,\r\nand underneath the leaning ash-tree in the Red Deeps. There seemed to\r\nbe some reproach in the words; did Philip mean that? She wished she had\r\nassured him more distinctly in their conversation that she desired not\r\nto renew the hope of love between them, _only_ because it clashed with\r\nher inevitable circumstances. She was touched, not thrilled by the\r\nsong; it suggested distinct memories and thoughts, and brought quiet\r\nregret in the place of excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way with you tenors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, who was waiting with\r\nmusic in his hand while Philip finished the song. \xe2\x80\x9cYou demoralise the\r\nfair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under all\r\nsorts of vile treatment. Nothing short of having your heads served up\r\nin a dish like that medi\xc3\xa6val tenor or troubadour, would prevent you\r\nfrom expressing your entire resignation. I must administer an antidote,\r\nwhile Miss Deane prepares to tear herself away from her bobbins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen rolled out, with saucy energy,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cShall I, wasting in despair,\r\n     Die because a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence.\r\nLucy, always proud of what Stephen did, went toward the piano with\r\nlaughing, admiring looks at him; and Maggie, in spite of her resistance\r\nto the spirit of the song and to the singer, was taken hold of and\r\nshaken by the invisible influence,\xe2\x80\x94was borne along by a wave too strong\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nBut, angrily resolved not to betray herself, she seized her work, and\r\nwent on making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much\r\nperseverance, not looking up or taking notice of what was going\r\nforward, until all the three voices united in \xe2\x80\x9cLet us take the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am afraid there would have been a subtle, stealing gratification in\r\nher mind if she had known how entirely this saucy, defiant Stephen was\r\noccupied with her; how he was passing rapidly from a determination to\r\ntreat her with ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for\r\nsome sign of inclination from her,\xe2\x80\x94some interchange of subdued word or\r\nlook with her. It was not long before he found an opportunity, when\r\nthey had passed to the music of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tempest.\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie, feeling the need\r\nof a footstool, was walking across the room to get one, when Stephen,\r\nwho was not singing just then, and was conscious of all her movements,\r\nguessed her want, and flew to anticipate her, lifting the footstool\r\nwith an entreating look at her, which made it impossible not to return\r\na glance of gratitude. And then, to have the footstool placed carefully\r\nby a too self-confident personage,\xe2\x80\x94not _any_ self-confident personage,\r\nbut one in particular, who suddenly looks humble and anxious, and\r\nlingers, bending still, to ask if there is not some draught in that\r\nposition between the window and the fireplace, and if he may not be\r\nallowed to move the work-table for her,\xe2\x80\x94these things will summon a\r\nlittle of the too ready, traitorous tenderness into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\ncompelled as she is in her girlish time to learn her life-lessons in\r\nvery trivial language. And to Maggie such things had not been everyday\r\nincidents, but were a new element in her life, and found her keen\r\nappetite for homage quite fresh. That tone of gentle solicitude obliged\r\nher to look at the face that was bent toward her, and to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nthank you\xe2\x80\x9d; and nothing could prevent that mutual glance from being\r\ndelicious to both, as it had been the evening before.\r\n\r\nIt was but an ordinary act of politeness in Stephen; it had hardly\r\ntaken two minutes; and Lucy, who was singing, scarcely noticed it. But\r\nto Philip\xe2\x80\x99s mind, filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely\r\nto find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident, this\r\nsudden eagerness in Stephen, and the change in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, which was\r\nplainly reflecting a beam from his, seemed so strong a contrast with\r\nthe previous overwrought signs of indifference, as to be charged with\r\npainful meaning. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s voice, pouring in again, jarred upon his\r\nnervous susceptibility as if it had been the clang of sheet-iron, and\r\nhe felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord. He had\r\nreally seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling\r\nbetween Stephen and Maggie; his own reason told him so, and he wanted\r\nto go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images,\r\ntill he had convinced himself of their nullity. But then, again, he\r\nwanted to stay as long as Stephen stayed,\xe2\x80\x94always to be present when\r\nStephen was present with Maggie. It seemed to poor Philip so natural,\r\nnay, inevitable, that any man who was near Maggie should fall in love\r\nwith her! There was no promise of happiness for her if she were\r\nbeguiled into loving Stephen Guest; and this thought emboldened Philip\r\nto view his own love for her in the light of a less unequal offering.\r\nHe was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward\r\ntumult, and Lucy was looking at him in astonishment, when Mrs\r\nTulliver\xe2\x80\x99s entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for\r\nabruptly breaking off the music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr Philip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, when they entered the dining-room,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you for a long while. Your father\xe2\x80\x99s not at home, I\r\nthink, is he? I went after him to the office the other day, and they\r\nsaid he was out of town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been to Mudport on business for several days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s come back now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs fond of his farming hobby as ever, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, rather wondering at this sudden interest\r\nin his father\xe2\x80\x99s pursuits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s got some land in his own hands on this side\r\nthe river as well as the other, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Deane, as he dispensed the pigeonpie, \xe2\x80\x9che must find\r\nfarming a heavy item,\xe2\x80\x94an expensive hobby. I never had a hobby myself,\r\nnever would give in to that. And the worst of all hobbies are those\r\nthat people think they can get money at. They shoot their money down\r\nlike corn out of a sack then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy felt a little nervous under her father\xe2\x80\x99s apparently gratuitous\r\ncriticism of Mr Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure. But it ceased there, and Mr Deane\r\nbecame unusually silent and meditative during his luncheon. Lucy,\r\naccustomed to watch all indications in her father, and having reasons,\r\nwhich had recently become strong, for an extra interest in what\r\nreferred to the Wakems, felt an unusual curiosity to know what had\r\nprompted her father\xe2\x80\x99s questions. His subsequent silence made her\r\nsuspect there had been some special reason for them in his mind.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when she\r\nwanted to tell or ask her father anything particular: she found a\r\nreason for her aunt Tulliver to leave the dining-room after dinner, and\r\nseated herself on a small stool at her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee. Mr Deane, under\r\nthose circumstances, considered that he tasted some of the most\r\nagreeable moments his merits had purchased him in life, notwithstanding\r\nthat Lucy, disliking to have her hair powdered with snuff, usually\r\nbegan by mastering his snuff-box on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to sleep yet, papa, _do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she\r\nbrought up her stool and opened the large fingers that clutched the\r\nsnuff-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, glancing at the reward of merit in the\r\ndecanter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do _you_ want?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pinching the dimpled chin\r\nfondly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket for your bazaar?\r\nEh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have no base motives at all to-day. I only want to talk, not to\r\nbeg. I want to know what made you ask Philip Wakem about his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarming to-day, papa? It seemed rather odd, because you never hardly\r\nsay anything to him about his father; and why should you care about Mr\r\nWakem\xe2\x80\x99s losing money by his hobby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to do with business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, waving his hands, as if\r\nto repel intrusion into that mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, papa, you always say Mr Wakem has brought Philip up like a girl;\r\nhow came you to think you should get any business knowledge out of him?\r\nThose abrupt questions sounded rather oddly. Philip thought them\r\nqueer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, willing to justify his social\r\ndemeanour, with which he had taken some pains in his upward progress.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a report that Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s mill and farm on the other side of the\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x94Dorlcote Mill, your uncle Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s, you know\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t answering so\r\nwell as it did. I wanted to see if your friend Philip would let\r\nanything out about his father\xe2\x80\x99s being tired of farming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Would you buy the mill, papa, if he would part with it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLucy, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell me everything; here, you shall have your\r\nsnuff-box if you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me. Because Maggie says all their hearts are\r\nset on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s getting back the mill some time. It was one of the last\r\nthings her father said to Tom, that he must get back the mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, you little puss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, availing himself of the\r\nrestored snuff-box. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not say a word about this thing; do you\r\nhear? There\xe2\x80\x99s very little chance of their getting the mill or of\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s getting it out of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s hands. And if he knew that we\r\nwanted it with a view to the Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s getting it again, he\xe2\x80\x99d be the\r\nless likely to part with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural, after what happened. He\r\nbehaved well enough to Tulliver before; but a horsewhipping is not\r\nlikely to be paid for with sugar-plums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a little air of solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you trust\r\nme? You must not ask me all my reasons for what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say, but I\r\nhave very strong reasons. And I\xe2\x80\x99m very cautious; I am, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I believe, if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our\r\nconfidence,\xe2\x80\x94let me tell him all about your wish to buy, and what it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor; that my cousins wish to have it, and why they wish to have it,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve Philip would help to bring it about. I know he would desire to\r\ndo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how that can be, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Deane, looking puzzled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should _he_ care?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then, with a sudden penetrating look at his\r\ndaughter, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s fond of you, and so you can\r\nmake him do what you like?\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr Deane felt quite safe about his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s affections.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, papa; he cares very little about me,\xe2\x80\x94not so much as I care about\r\nhim. But I have a reason for being quite sure of what I say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nask me. And if you ever guess, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. Only give me leave to do\r\nas I think fit about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and\r\nkissed him with that last request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t do mischief, now?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at her with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, papa, quite sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m very wise; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all your business\r\ntalents. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you admire my accompt-book, now, when I showed it you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, if this youngster will keep his counsel, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmuch harm done. And to tell the truth, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s not much chance\r\nfor us any other way. Now, let me go off to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nWakem in a New Light\r\n\r\nBefore three days had passed after the conversation you have just\r\noverheard between Lucy and her father she had contrived to have a\r\nprivate interview with Philip during a visit of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s to her aunt\r\nGlegg. For a day and a night Philip turned over in his mind with\r\nrestless agitation all that Lucy had told him in that interview, till\r\nhe had thoroughly resolved on a course of action. He thought he saw\r\nbefore him now a possibility of altering his position with respect to\r\nMaggie, and removing at least one obstacle between them. He laid his\r\nplan and calculated all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a\r\nchess-player in the days of his first ardor, and was amazed himself at\r\nhis sudden genius as a tactician. His plan was as bold as it was\r\nthoroughly calculated. Having watched for a moment when his father had\r\nnothing more urgent on his hands than the newspaper, he went behind\r\nhim, laid a hand on his shoulder, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, will you come up into my sanctum, and look at my new sketches?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged them now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting terrible stiff in the joints, Phil, for climbing those\r\nstairs of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, looking kindly at his son as he laid down\r\nhis paper. \xe2\x80\x9cBut come along, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a nice place for you, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Phil?\xe2\x80\x94a capital light that\r\nfrom the roof, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d was, as usual, the first thing he said on entering\r\nthe painting-room. He liked to remind himself and his son too that his\r\nfatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He had been a good\r\nfather. Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there, if she\r\ncame back again from her grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his double eye-glass over his nose, and\r\nseating himself to take a general view while he rested, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nfamous show here. Upon my word, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that your things aren\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\ngood as that London artist\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s his name\xe2\x80\x94that Leyburn gave so much\r\nmoney for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shook his head and smiled. He had seated himself on his\r\npainting-stool, and had taken a lead pencil in his hand, with which he\r\nwas making strong marks to counteract the sense of tremulousness. He\r\nwatched his father get up, and walk slowly round, good-naturedly\r\ndwelling on the pictures much longer than his amount of genuine taste\r\nfor landscape would have prompted, till he stopped before a stand on\r\nwhich two pictures were placed,\xe2\x80\x94one much larger than the other, the\r\nsmaller one in a leather case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me! what have you here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, startled by a sudden\r\ntransition from landscape to portrait. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d left off\r\nfigures. Who are these?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the same person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with calm promptness, \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\ndifferent ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what person?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, sharply fixing his eyes with a growing\r\nlook of suspicion on the larger picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tulliver. The small one is something like what she was when I was\r\nat school with her brother at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton; the larger one is not\r\nquite so good a likeness of what she was when I came from abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWakem turned round fiercely, with a flushed face, letting his eye-glass\r\nfall, and looking at his son with a savage expression for a moment, as\r\nif he was ready to strike that daring feebleness from the stool. But he\r\nthrew himself into the armchair again, and thrust his hands into his\r\ntrouser-pockets, still looking angrily at his son, however. Philip did\r\nnot return the look, but sat quietly watching the point of his pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with\r\nher since you came from abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, at last, with that vain\r\neffort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it\r\ndesires to inflict into words and tones, since blows are forbidden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. We met often in that thicket\xe2\x80\x94the Red Deeps\xe2\x80\x94near Dorlcote Mill. I\r\nlove her dearly; I shall never love any other woman. I have thought of\r\nher ever since she was a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, sir! And you have corresponded with her all this while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I never told her I loved her till just before we parted, and she\r\npromised her brother not to see me again or to correspond with me. I am\r\nnot sure that she loves me or would consent to marry me. But if she\r\nwould consent,\xe2\x80\x94if she _did_ love me well enough,\xe2\x80\x94I should marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I\xe2\x80\x99ve heaped\r\non you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, getting white, and beginning to tremble under an\r\nenraged sense of impotence before Philip\xe2\x80\x99s calm defiance and\r\nconcentration of purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, looking up at him for the first time; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t regard it as a return. You have been an indulgent father to me;\r\nbut I have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate wish\r\nto give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit, not\r\nthat it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances\r\nof happiness to satisfy feelings of yours which I can never share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think most sons would share their father\xe2\x80\x99s feelings in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Wakem, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s father was an ignorant mad brute, who\r\nwas within an inch of murdering me. The whole town knows it. And the\r\nbrother is just as insolent, only in a cooler way. He forbade her\r\nseeing you, you say; he\xe2\x80\x99ll break every bone in your body, for your\r\ngreater happiness, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care. But you seem to have made up\r\nyour mind; you have counted the consequences, I suppose. Of course you\r\nare independent of me; you can marry this girl to-morrow, if you like;\r\nyou are a man of five-and-twenty,\xe2\x80\x94you can go your way, and I can go\r\nmine. We need have no more to do with each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWakem rose and walked toward the door, but something held him back, and\r\ninstead of leaving the room, he walked up and down it. Philip was slow\r\nto reply, and when he spoke, his tone had a more incisive quietness and\r\nclearness than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I can\xe2\x80\x99t marry Miss Tulliver, even if she would have me, if I have\r\nonly my own resources to maintain her with. I have been brought up to\r\nno profession. I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer her poverty as well as deformity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _there_ is a reason for your clinging to me, doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWakem, still bitterly, though Philip\xe2\x80\x99s last words had given him a pang;\r\nthey had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter of a\r\ncentury. He threw himself into the chair again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI know these scenes are often\r\nhappening between father and son. If I were like other men of my age, I\r\nmight answer your angry words by still angrier; we might part; I should\r\nmarry the woman I love, and have a chance of being as happy as the\r\nrest. But if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very\r\nobject of everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me, you have an advantage over\r\nmost fathers; you can completely deprive me of the only thing that\r\nwould make my life worth having.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip paused, but his father was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best what satisfaction you would have, beyond that of\r\ngratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRidiculous rancor!\xe2\x80\x9d Wakem burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Damn it! is a\r\nman to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him for it? Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat cold, proud devil of a son, who said a word to me I shall not\r\nforget when we had the settling. He would be as pleasant a mark for a\r\nbullet as I know, if he were worth the expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean your resentment toward them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, who had his\r\nreasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cthough a feeling of\r\nrevenge is not worth much, that you should care to keep it. I mean your\r\nextending the enmity to a helpless girl, who has too much sense and\r\ngoodness to share their narrow prejudices. _She_ has never entered into\r\nthe family quarrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that signify? We don\xe2\x80\x99t ask what a woman does; we ask whom\r\nshe belongs to. It\xe2\x80\x99s altogether a degrading thing to you, to think of\r\nmarrying old Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the dialogue, Philip lost some of his\r\nself-control, and coloured with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with bitter incisiveness, \xe2\x80\x9chas the only\r\ngrounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to\r\nthe middle class; she is thoroughly refined, and her friends, whatever\r\nelse they may be, are respected for irreproachable honour and\r\nintegrity. All St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, I fancy, would pronounce her to be more than\r\nmy equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son; but Philip was not\r\nlooking at him, and with a certain penitent consciousness went on, in a\r\nfew moments, as if in amplification of his last words,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind a single person in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s who will not tell you that a\r\nbeautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a\r\npitiable object like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot she!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else in\r\na burst of resentful pride, half fatherly, half personal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be\r\na deuced fine match for her. It\xe2\x80\x99s all stuff about an accidental\r\ndeformity, when a girl\xe2\x80\x99s really attached to a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his\r\nprevious position, \xe2\x80\x9cif she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for you, you might have spared\r\nyourself the trouble of talking to me about her, and you might have\r\nspared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely\r\nto happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately\r\nwrought upon as he had expected, by what had passed; but the scene had\r\njarred upon his nerves, which were as sensitive as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s. He\r\ndetermined not to go down to dinner; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet his father again\r\nthat day. It was Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s habit, when he had no company at home, to go\r\nout in the evening, often as early as half-past seven; and as it was\r\nfar on in the afternoon now, Philip locked up his room and went out for\r\na long ramble, thinking he would not return until his father was out of\r\nthe house again. He got into a boat, and went down the river to a\r\nfavourite village, where he dined, and lingered till it was late enough\r\nfor him to return. He had never had any sort of quarrel with his father\r\nbefore, and had a sickening fear that this contest, just begun, might\r\ngo on for weeks; and what might not happen in that time? He would not\r\nallow himself to define what that involuntary question meant. But if he\r\ncould once be in the position of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s accepted, acknowledged lover,\r\nthere would be less room for vague dread. He went up to his\r\npainting-room again, and threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the\r\narmchair, looking round absently at the views of water and rock that\r\nwere ranged around, till he fell into a doze, in which he fancied\r\nMaggie was slipping down a glistening, green, slimy channel of a\r\nwaterfall, and he was looking on helpless, till he was awakened by what\r\nseemed a sudden, awful crash.\r\n\r\nIt was the opening of the door, and he could hardly have dozed more\r\nthan a few moments, for there was no perceptible change in the evening\r\nlight. It was his father who entered; and when Philip moved to vacate\r\nthe chair for him, he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit still. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather walk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stalked up and down the room once or twice, and then, standing\r\nopposite Philip with his hands thrust in his side pockets, he said, as\r\nif continuing a conversation that had not been broken off,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this girl seems to have been fond of you, Phil, else she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave met you in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating rapidly, and a transient flush passed over\r\nhis face like a gleam. It was not quite easy to speak at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe liked me at King\xe2\x80\x99s Lorton, when she was a little girl, because I\r\nused to sit with her brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot.\r\nShe had kept that in her memory, and thought of me as a friend of a\r\nlong while ago. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of me as a lover when she met me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you made love to her at last. What did she say then?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWakem, walking about again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said she _did_ love me then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, then; what else do you want? Is she a jilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was very young then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she\r\nhardly knew what she felt. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid our long separation, and the idea\r\nthat events must always divide us, may have made a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s in the town. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her at church. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you spoken to\r\nher since you came back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t renew my proposals to her on\r\nseveral grounds. One obstacle would be removed if you would give your\r\nconsent,\xe2\x80\x94if you would be willing to think of her as a daughter-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWakem was silent a little while, pausing before Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not the sort of woman your mother was, though, Phil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nat last. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw her at church,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s handsomer than this,\xe2\x80\x94deuced fine\r\neyes and fine figure, I saw; but rather dangerous and unmanageable,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very tender and affectionate, and so simple,\xe2\x80\x94without the airs\r\nand petty contrivances other women have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wakem. Then looking round at his son, \xe2\x80\x9cBut your mother\r\nlooked gentler; she had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes, like yours.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t remember her very well. It was a thousand pities I\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nlikeness of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be glad for me to have the same sort of happiness,\r\nfather, to sweeten my life for me? There can never be another tie so\r\nstrong to you as that which began eight-and-twenty years ago, when you\r\nmarried my mother, and you have been tightening it ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Phil, you\xe2\x80\x99re the only fellow that knows the best of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWakem, giving his hand to his son. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep together if we can.\r\nAnd now, what am I to do? You must come downstairs and tell me. Am I to\r\ngo and call on this dark-eyed damsel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barrier once thrown down in this way, Philip could talk freely to\r\nhis father of their entire relation with the Tullivers,\xe2\x80\x94of the desire\r\nto get the mill and land back into the family, and of its transfer to\r\nGuest & Co. as an intermediate step. He could venture now to be\r\npersuasive and urgent, and his father yielded with more readiness than\r\nhe had calculated on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the mill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, with a sort of angry\r\ncompliance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had an infernal deal of bother lately about the mill.\r\nLet them pay me for my improvements, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing\r\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. I shall have no direct transactions with young\r\nTulliver. If you like to swallow him for his sister\xe2\x80\x99s sake, you may;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve no sauce that will make him go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went to\r\nMr Deane the next day, to say that Mr Wakem was ready to open the\r\nnegotiations, and Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s pretty triumph as she appealed to her father\r\nwhether she had not proved her great business abilities. Mr Deane was\r\nrather puzzled, and suspected that there had been something \xe2\x80\x9cgoing on\xe2\x80\x9d\r\namong the young people to which he wanted a clew. But to men of Mr\r\nDeane\xe2\x80\x99s stamp, what goes on among the young people is as extraneous to\r\nthe real business of life as what goes on among the birds and\r\nbutterflies, until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on monetary\r\naffairs. And in this case the bearing appeared to be entirely\r\npropitious.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nCharity in Full-Dress\r\n\r\nThe culmination of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s career as an admired member of society in\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s was certainly the day of the bazaar, when her simple noble\r\nbeauty, clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating kind, which I\r\nsuspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe,\r\nappeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and\r\nconventional women around her. We perhaps never detect how much of our\r\nsocial demeanour is made up of artificial airs until we see a person\r\nwho is at once beautiful and simple; without the beauty, we are apt to\r\ncall simplicity awkwardness. The Miss Guests were much too well-bred to\r\nhave any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to pretentious\r\nvulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat, it\r\nseemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her chin too high, and\r\nthat Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect.\r\n\r\nAll well-dressed St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s and its neighbourhood were there; and it\r\nwould have been worth while to come even from a distance, to see the\r\nfine old hall, with its open roof and carved oaken rafters, and great\r\noaken folding-doors, and light shed down from a height on the\r\nmany-coloured show beneath; a very quaint place, with broad faded\r\nstripes painted on the walls, and here and there a show of heraldic\r\nanimals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems of\r\na noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall. A grand arch,\r\ncut in the upper wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra, with\r\nan open room behind it, where hothouse plants and stalls for\r\nrefreshments were disposed; an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed\r\nto loiter, and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a\r\nmore commodious point of view. In fact, the perfect fitness of this\r\nancient building for an admirable modern purpose, that made charity\r\ntruly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit,\r\nwas so striking that hardly a person entered the room without\r\nexchanging the remark more than once. Near the great arch over the\r\norchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one of the\r\nvenerable inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this\r\nthat Lucy had her stall, for the convenience of certain large plain\r\narticles which she had taken charge of for Mrs Kenn. Maggie had begged\r\nto sit at the open end of the stall, and to have the sale of these\r\narticles rather than of bead-mats and other elaborate products of which\r\nshe had but a dim understanding. But it soon appeared that the\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-gowns, which were among her commodities, were\r\nobjects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so\r\ntroublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits,\r\ntogether with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make her\r\npost a very conspicuous one. The ladies who had commodities of their\r\nown to sell, and did not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the frivolity\r\nand bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which any tailor\r\ncould furnish; and it is possible that the emphatic notice of various\r\nkinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public occasion,\r\nthrew a very strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in\r\nmany minds then present. Not that anger, on account of spurned beauty\r\ncan dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies, but rather\r\nthat the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily\r\ntake a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast; and also, that\r\nto-day Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s conspicuous position, for the first time, made evident\r\ncertain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an\r\nexplanatory bearing. There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirect gaze, and something undefinably coarse in the style of her\r\nbeauty, which placed her, in the opinion of all feminine judges, far\r\nbelow her cousin Miss Deane; for the ladies of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s had now\r\ncompletely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of\r\nMr Stephen Guest.\r\n\r\nAs for dear little Lucy herself, her late benevolent triumph about the\r\nMill, and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for Maggie\r\nand Philip, helped to give her the highest spirits to-day, and she felt\r\nnothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s attractiveness. It is\r\ntrue, she was looking very charming herself, and Stephen was paying her\r\nthe utmost attention on this public occasion; jealously buying up the\r\narticles he had seen under her fingers in the process of making, and\r\ngayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the\r\nmost effeminate futilities. He chose to lay aside his hat and wear a\r\nscarlet fez of her embroidering; but by superficial observers this was\r\nnecessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to Lucy than\r\nas a mark of coxcombry. \xe2\x80\x9cGuest is a great coxcomb,\xe2\x80\x9d young Torry\r\nobserved; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then he is a privileged person in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he carries\r\nall before him; if another fellow did such things, everybody would say\r\nhe made a fool of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said,\r\nin rather a vexed undertone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, now; all the things of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s knitting will be gone, and you\r\nwill not have bought one. There are those deliciously soft warm things\r\nfor the wrists,\xe2\x80\x94do buy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must be intended for imaginative persons,\r\nwho can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty\r\nCaucasus. Stern reason is my forte, you know. You must get Philip to\r\nbuy those. By the way, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined\r\nhim to come. He said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of\r\nthe world rejected. But now, do go and buy something of Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; see, she has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just\r\ncoming up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she\r\nwent through this first interview, since a sadly memorable time, with a\r\nman toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings; but she\r\nwas pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once into\r\ntalk about the bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing,\r\nsmiling now and then kindly at Maggie, and not calling on her to speak\r\nmuch, as if he observed that she was rather pale and tremulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cis it pure magnanimity? You\r\ntalked of a family quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, becoming a\r\nlittle indiscreet in her satisfaction, and speaking with an air of\r\nsignificance. But Stephen did not appear to notice this, and as some\r\nlady-purchasers came up, he lounged on toward Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s end, handling\r\ntrifles and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his purse,\r\nhad finished his transactions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son came with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he overheard Wakem saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has vanished\r\ninto some other part of the building, and has left all these charitable\r\ngallantries to me. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll reproach him for his shabby conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned his smile and bow without speaking, and he turned away,\r\nonly then observing Stephen and nodding to him. Maggie, conscious that\r\nStephen was still there, busied herself with counting money, and\r\navoided looking up. She had been well pleased that he had devoted\r\nhimself to Lucy to-day, and had not come near her. They had begun the\r\nmorning with an indifferent salutation, and both had rejoiced in being\r\naloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done without his\r\nopium, in spite of former failures in resolution. And during the last\r\nfew days they had even been making up their minds to failures, looking\r\nto the outward events that must soon come to separate them, as a reason\r\nfor dispensing with self-conquest in detail.\r\n\r\nStephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged,\r\nuntil he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden\r\nby a screen of draperies. Maggie went on counting her money till she\r\nsuddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you very tired? Do\r\nlet me bring you something,\xe2\x80\x94some fruit or jelly, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a\r\nharp close by her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly, and only half looking up for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look so pale,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you\xe2\x80\x99re exhausted. I must disobey you, and bring something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me? What have I done? _Do_ look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking at him helplessly, her eyes\r\nglancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra,\r\nwhich was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain.\r\nMaggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the\r\nadmission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and following\r\nher upward glance, he saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half-hidden\r\ncorner, so that he could command little more than that angle of the\r\nhall in which Maggie sat. An entirely new thought occurred to Stephen,\r\nand linking itself with what he had observed of Wakem\xe2\x80\x99s manner, and\r\nwith Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s reply to his observation, it convinced him that there had\r\nbeen some former relation between Philip and Maggie beyond that\r\nchildish one of which he had heard. More than one impulse made him\r\nimmediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshment-room,\r\nwhere, walking up to Philip, he sat down behind him, and put his hand\r\non his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you studying for a portrait, Phil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor for a sketch of\r\nthat oriel window? By George, it makes a capital bit from this dark\r\ncorner, with the curtain just marking it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been studying expression,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Miss Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s? It\xe2\x80\x99s rather of the savage-moody order to-day, I\r\nthink,\xe2\x80\x94something of the fallen princess serving behind a counter. Her\r\ncousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some refreshment,\r\nbut I have been snubbed, as usual. There\xe2\x80\x99s natural antipathy between\r\nus, I suppose; I have seldom the honour to please her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hypocrite you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, flushing angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! because experience must have told me that I\xe2\x80\x99m universally\r\npleasing? I admit the law, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some disturbing force here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, rising abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I\xe2\x80\x94to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive. I\r\nthink I have done suit and service long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends walked downstairs together without speaking. Philip\r\nturned through the outer door into the court-yard; but Stephen, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the by, I must call in here,\xe2\x80\x9d went on along the passage to one\r\nof the rooms at the other end of the building, which were appropriated\r\nto the town library. He had the room all to himself, and a man requires\r\nnothing less than this when he wants to dash his cap on the table,\r\nthrow himself astride a chair, and stare at a high brick wall with a\r\nfrown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been\r\nslaying \xe2\x80\x9cthe giant Python.\xe2\x80\x9d The conduct that issues from a moral\r\nconflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that the distinction\r\nescapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of actions.\r\nIt is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was not a hypocrite,\xe2\x80\x94capable\r\nof deliberate doubleness for a selfish end; and yet his fluctuations\r\nbetween the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic concealment of\r\nit might have made a good case in support of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s accusation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling, with that\r\npainful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed\r\ntears. Was her life to be always like this,\xe2\x80\x94always bringing some new\r\nsource of inward strife? She heard confusedly the busy, indifferent\r\nvoices around her, and wished her mind could flow into that easy\r\nbabbling current. It was at this moment that Dr Kenn, who had quite\r\nlately come into the hall, and was now walking down the middle with his\r\nhands behind him, taking a general view, fixed his eyes on Maggie for\r\nthe first time, and was struck with the expression of pain on her\r\nbeautiful face. She was sitting quite still, for the stream of\r\ncustomers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the\r\ngentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day, and Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s stall\r\nwas looking rather bare. This, with her absent, pained expression,\r\nfinished the contrast between her and her companions, who were all\r\nbright, eager, and busy. He was strongly arrested. Her face had\r\nnaturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church, and\r\nhe had been introduced to her during a short call on business at Mr\r\nDeane\xe2\x80\x99s, but he had never spoken more than three words to her. He\r\nwalked toward her now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching,\r\nroused herself to look up and be prepared to speak. She felt a\r\nchildlike, instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this\r\nexertion, when she saw it was Dr Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s face that was looking at her;\r\nthat plain, middle-aged face, with a grave, penetrating kindness in it,\r\nseeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm, safe strand,\r\nbut was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still tossed by\r\nthe waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was afterward\r\nremembered by her as if it had been a promise. The middle-aged, who\r\nhave lived through their strongest emotions, but are yet in the time\r\nwhen memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative,\r\nshould surely be a sort of natural priesthood, whom life has\r\ndisciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of early\r\nstumblers and victims of self-despair. Most of us, at some moment in\r\nour young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in\r\nany sort of canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to scramble upward into\r\nall the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid, as Maggie\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Dr Kenn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to simpler\r\namiable denials of obvious facts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can tell Mrs Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very\r\nquickly,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cshe will be very much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the\r\ndressing-gowns and embroidered waistcoats, but I think any of the other\r\nladies would have sold more; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr Kenn smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have you as a permanent\r\nparishioner now, Miss Tulliver; am I? You have been at a distance from\r\nus hitherto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a teacher in a school, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going into another\r\nsituation of the same kind very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh? I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in\r\nthis neighbourhood, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I must go_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr Kenn with an\r\nexpression of reliance, as if she had told him her history in those\r\nthree words. It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which\r\nwill sometimes happen even between people who meet quite\r\ntransiently,\xe2\x80\x94on a mile\xe2\x80\x99s journey, perhaps, or when resting by the\r\nwayside. There is always this possibility of a word or look from a\r\nstranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood.\r\n\r\nDr Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence\r\nof Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s was charged with meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou feel it right to go. But that will not\r\nprevent our meeting again, I hope; it will not prevent my knowing you\r\nbetter, if I can be of any service to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has some trouble or other at heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child! she\r\nlooks as if she might turn out to be one of\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98The souls by nature pitched too high,\r\n     By suffering plunged too low.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an\r\nexcessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not\r\nabsent now, any more than when she was instructing the gypsies with a\r\nview toward achieving a royal position among them, was not more elated\r\non a day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles,\r\ntogether with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily\r\ncome from being taken before Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s chevalglass, and made to look at\r\nthe full length of her tall beauty, crowned by the night of her massy\r\nhair. Maggie had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had\r\nforgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty. If that state of\r\nmind could have lasted, her choice would have been to have Stephen\r\nGuest at her feet, offering her a life filled with all luxuries, with\r\ndaily incense of adoration near and distant, and with all possibilities\r\nof culture at her command. But there were things in her stronger than\r\nvanity,\xe2\x80\x94passion and affection, and long, deep memories of early\r\ndiscipline and effort, of early claims on her love and pity; and the\r\nstream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled imperceptibly with\r\nthat wider current which was at its highest force today, under the\r\ndouble urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nPhilip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles\r\nbetween them on his father\xe2\x80\x99s side,\xe2\x80\x94he shrank from that; but he had told\r\neverything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie, being informed through\r\nher, might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus\r\nmuch nearer to each other was a happiness to her. The rush of\r\nconflicting feelings was too great for Maggie to say much when Lucy,\r\nwith a face breathing playful joy, like one of Correggio\xe2\x80\x99s cherubs,\r\npoured forth her triumphant revelation; and Lucy could hardly be\r\nsurprised that she could do little more than cry with gladness at the\r\nthought of her father\xe2\x80\x99s wish being fulfilled, and of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s getting the\r\nMill again in reward for all his hard striving. The details of\r\npreparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s attention for\r\nthe next few days, and nothing had been said by the cousins on subjects\r\nthat were likely to rouse deeper feelings. Philip had been to the house\r\nmore than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation with him,\r\nand thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nBut when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone again,\r\nresting together at home, Lucy said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after\r\nto-morrow, Maggie; write a note to her, and tell her you have put it\r\noff at my request, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the man with it. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndispleased; you\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you to go out of the way just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed I must go, dear; I can\xe2\x80\x99t put it off. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave aunt\r\nGritty out for the world. And I shall have very little time, for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing away to a new situation on the 25th of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, almost white with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, making a great effort to\r\ncommand herself, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so busy. But some time ago I\r\nwrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her to let me know if\r\nshe met with any situation that I could fill, and the other day I had a\r\nletter from her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of\r\nhers to the coast during the holidays, and then make trial of a\r\nsituation with her as teacher. I wrote yesterday to accept the offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9chow could you be so unkind to me\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\ntell me\xe2\x80\x94to take _such_ a step\xe2\x80\x94and now!\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated a little, and\r\nthen added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Philip? I thought everything was going to be so happy.\r\nOh, Maggie, what is the reason? Give it up; let me write. There is\r\nnothing now to keep you and Philip apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is Tom\xe2\x80\x99s feeling. He said I must\r\ngive him up if I married Philip. And I know he will not change\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\nnot for a long while\xe2\x80\x94unless something happened to soften him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will talk to him; he\xe2\x80\x99s coming back this week. And this good news\r\nabout the Mill will soften him. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to him about Philip.\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s always very compliant to me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s so obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a distressed voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave some\r\ntime to pack. Don\xe2\x80\x99t press me to stay, dear Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy was silent for two or three minutes, looking away and ruminating.\r\nAt length she knelt down by her cousin, and looking up in her face with\r\nanxious seriousness, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, is it that you don\xe2\x80\x99t love Philip well enough to marry him?\r\nTell me\xe2\x80\x94trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie held Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s hands tightly in silence a little while. Her own\r\nhands were quite cold. But when she spoke, her voice was quite clear\r\nand distinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lucy, I would choose to marry him. I think it would be the best\r\nand highest lot for me,\xe2\x80\x94to make his life happy. He loved me first. No\r\none else could be quite what he is to me. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t divide myself\r\nfrom my brother for life. I must go away, and wait. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to\r\nme again about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy obeyed in pain and wonder. The next word she said was,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear Maggie, at least you will go to the dance at Park House\r\nto-morrow, and have some music and brightness, before you go to pay\r\nthese dull dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and the tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nThe Spell Seems Broken\r\n\r\nThe suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly\r\nbrilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen\r\ncouples, with attendant parents and guardians. The focus of brilliancy\r\nwas the long drawing-room, where the dancing went forward, under the\r\ninspiration of the grand piano; the library, into which it opened at\r\none end, had the more sober illumination of maturity, with caps and\r\ncards; and at the other end the pretty sitting-room, with a\r\nconservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool retreat. Lucy,\r\nwho had laid aside her black for the first time, and had her pretty\r\nslimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the\r\nacknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss\r\nGuests\xe2\x80\x99 thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any\r\naristocracy higher than that of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and stretching to the extreme\r\nlimits of commercial and professional gentility.\r\n\r\nMaggie at first refused to dance, saying that she had forgotten all the\r\nfigures\xe2\x80\x94it was so many years since she had danced at school; and she\r\nwas glad to have that excuse, for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart.\r\nBut at length the music wrought in her young limbs, and the longing\r\ncame; even though it was the horrible young Torry, who walked up a\r\nsecond time to try and persuade her. She warned him that she could not\r\ndance anything but a country-dance; but he, of course, was willing to\r\nwait for that high felicity, meaning only to be complimentary when he\r\nassured her at several intervals that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat bore\xe2\x80\x9d that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waltz, he would have liked so much to waltz with her. But at\r\nlast it was the turn of the good old-fashioned dance which has the\r\nleast of vanity and the most of merriment in it, and Maggie quite\r\nforgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that half-rustic\r\nrhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette. She felt quite\r\ncharitably toward young Torry, as his hand bore her along and held her\r\nup in the dance; her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them\r\nwhich will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it; and her\r\nsimple black dress, with its bit of black lace, seemed like the dim\r\nsetting of a jewel.\r\n\r\nStephen had not yet asked her to dance; had not yet paid her more than\r\na passing civility. Since yesterday, that inward vision of her which\r\nperpetually made part of his consciousness, had been half screened by\r\nthe image of Philip Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there was\r\nsome attachment between her and Philip; at least there was an\r\nattachment on his side, which made her feel in some bondage. Here,\r\nthen, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honour which called on\r\nhim to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to\r\noverpower him. He told himself so; and yet he had once or twice felt a\r\ncertain savage resistance, and at another moment a shuddering\r\nrepugnance, to this intrusion of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s image, which almost made it a\r\nnew incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself.\r\nNevertheless, he had done what he meant to do this evening,\xe2\x80\x94he had kept\r\naloof from her; he had hardly looked at her; and he had been gayly\r\nassiduous to Lucy. But now his eyes were devouring Maggie; he felt\r\ninclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and take his place. Then\r\nhe wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his partner. The\r\npossibility that he too should dance with Maggie, and have her hand in\r\nhis so long, was beginning to possess him like a thirst. But even now\r\ntheir hands were meeting in the dance,\xe2\x80\x94were meeting still to the very\r\nend of it, though they were far off each other.\r\n\r\nStephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got\r\nthrough the duties of politeness in the interval, until he was free and\r\nsaw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of the room. He made\r\nhis way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz;\r\nand when Maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought, she\r\nfelt, in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before, a glowing\r\ngladness at heart. Her eyes and cheeks were still brightened with her\r\nchildlike enthusiasm in the dance; her whole frame was set to joy and\r\ntenderness; even the coming pain could not seem bitter,\xe2\x80\x94she was ready\r\nto welcome it as a part of life, for life at this moment seemed a keen,\r\nvibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain. This one, this\r\nlast night, she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the\r\npresent, without those chill, eating thoughts of the past and the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to waltz again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, bending to speak to her,\r\nwith that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams\r\ncreate to themselves in the summer woods when low, cooing voices fill\r\nthe air. Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them\r\ninto a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are going to waltz again. It is rather dizzy work to look on, and\r\nthe room is very warm; shall we walk about a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and placed it within his arm, and they walked on into\r\nthe sitting-room, where the tables were strewn with engravings for the\r\naccommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them. But no\r\nvisitors were here at this moment. They passed on into the\r\nconservatory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights\r\namong them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThey look as if they\r\nbelonged to an enchanted land, and would never fade away; I could fancy\r\nthey were all made of jewels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke, and Stephen made\r\nno answer; but he was looking at her; and does not a supreme poet blend\r\nlight and sound into one, calling darkness mute, and light eloquent?\r\nSomething strangely powerful there was in the light of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s long\r\ngaze, for it made Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face turn toward it and look upward at it,\r\nslowly, like a flower at the ascending brightness. And they walked\r\nunsteadily on, without feeling that they were walking; without feeling\r\nanything but that long, grave, mutual gaze which has the solemnity\r\nbelonging to all deep human passion. The hovering thought that they\r\nmust and would renounce each other made this moment of mute confession\r\nmore intense in its rapture.\r\n\r\nBut they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to\r\npause and turn. The change of movement brought a new consciousness to\r\nMaggie; she blushed deeply, turned away her head, and drew her arm from\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s, going up to some flowers to smell them. Stephen stood\r\nmotionless, and still pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, may I get this rose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, making a great effort to say\r\nsomething, and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am quite wicked with roses; I like to gather them and smell\r\nthem till they have no scent left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen was mute; he was incapable of putting a sentence together, and\r\nMaggie bent her arm a little upward toward the large half-opened rose\r\nthat had attracted her. Who has not felt the beauty of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm?\r\nThe unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled\r\nelbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves, down to the delicate\r\nwrist, with its tiniest, almost imperceptible nicks in the firm\r\nsoftness. A woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two\r\nthousand years ago, so that he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon\r\nwhich moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a\r\nheadless trunk. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s was such an arm as that, and it had the warm\r\ntints of life.\r\n\r\nA mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted toward the arm, and showered\r\nkisses on it, clasping the wrist.\r\n\r\nBut the next moment Maggie snatched it from him, and glared at him like\r\na wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have I given you to insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe darted from him into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the\r\nsofa, panting and trembling.\r\n\r\nA horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that was treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her own\r\nbetter soul. That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight, a\r\nleprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of _her_ than he did of Lucy.\r\n\r\nAs for Stephen, he leaned back against the framework of the\r\nconservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,\xe2\x80\x94love, rage, and\r\nconfused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that\r\nhe had offended Maggie.\r\n\r\nThe last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her side again and\r\nentreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive\r\nfor him, and she had not been seated more than a few minutes when he\r\ncame and stood humbly before her. But Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s bitter rage was unspent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me to myself, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with impetuous\r\nhaughtiness, \xe2\x80\x9cand for the future avoid me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end\r\nof the room. There was the dire necessity of going back into the\r\ndancing-room again, and he was beginning to be conscious of that. They\r\nhad been absent so short a time, that when he went in again the waltz\r\nwas not ended.\r\n\r\nMaggie, too, was not long before she re-entered. All the pride of her\r\nnature was stung into activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged\r\nher within reach of this wound to her self-respect had at least wrought\r\nits own cure. The thoughts and temptations of the last month should all\r\nbe flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory. There was nothing to\r\nallure her now; duty would be easy, and all the old calm purposes would\r\nreign peacefully once more. She re-entered the drawing-room still with\r\nsome excited brightness in her face, but with a sense of proud\r\nself-command that defied anything to agitate her. She refused to dance\r\nagain, but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one who\r\naddressed her. And when they got home that night, she kissed Lucy with\r\na free heart, almost exulting in this scorching moment, which had\r\ndelivered her from the possibility of another word or look that would\r\nhave the stamp of treachery toward that gentle, unsuspicious sister.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she\r\nhad expected. Her mother was to accompany her in the carriage, and\r\nhousehold business could not be dispatched hastily by Mrs Tulliver. So\r\nMaggie, who had been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit waiting,\r\nequipped for the drive, in the garden. Lucy was busy in the house\r\nwrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at Basset, and\r\nwhen there was a loud ring at the door-bell, Maggie felt some alarm\r\nlest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her; it was sure to be Stephen.\r\n\r\nBut presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated\r\nhimself by her on the garden-chair. It was not Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs, Maggie, from this\r\nseat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThey had taken each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands in silence, but Maggie had looked at\r\nhim with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate\r\nsmile than he had seen before, and he felt encouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI often look at them, and wish I could see the low\r\nsunlight on the stems again. But I have never been that way but\r\nonce,\xe2\x80\x94to the churchyard with my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been there, I go there, continually,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnothing but the past to live upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her hand in\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s. They had so often walked hand in hand!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember all the spots,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cjust where you told me of\r\nparticular things, beautiful stories that I had never heard of before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go there again soon, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, getting\r\ntimid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mill will soon be your brother\xe2\x80\x99s home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I shall not be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall only hear of\r\nthat happiness. I am going away again; Lucy has not told you, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the future will never join on to the past again, Maggie? That\r\nbook is quite closed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating\r\nworship, looked up at her now, with a last struggling ray of hope in\r\nthem, and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat book never will be closed, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with grave sadness;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire no future that will break the ties of the past. But the tie\r\nto my brother is one of the strongest. I can do nothing willingly that\r\nwill divide me always from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the only reason that would keep us apart forever, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip, with a desperate determination to have a definite answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with calm decision. And she believed\r\nit. At that moment she felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to\r\nthe ground. The reactionary excitement that gave her a proud\r\nself-mastery had not subsided, and she looked at the future with a\r\nsense of calm choice.\r\n\r\nThey sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a\r\nfew minutes; in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s mind the first scenes of love and parting were\r\nmore present than the actual moment, and she was looking at Philip in\r\nthe Red Deeps.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer\r\nof hers; she was as open and transparent as a rock-pool. Why was he not\r\nthoroughly happy? Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an\r\nomniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nIn the Lane\r\n\r\nMaggie had been four days at her aunt Moss\xe2\x80\x99s giving the early June\r\nsunshine quite a new brightness in the care-dimmed eyes of that\r\naffectionate woman, and making an epoch for her cousins great and\r\nsmall, who were learning her words and actions by heart, as if she had\r\nbeen a transient avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty.\r\n\r\nShe was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins\r\nfeeding the chickens, at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards\r\nbefore the afternoon milking-time. The great buildings round the hollow\r\nyard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the old\r\ngarden-wall the straggling rose-bushes were beginning to toss their\r\nsummer weight, and the gray wood and old bricks of the house, on its\r\nhigher level, had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon sunlight,\r\nthat suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her bonnet over her arm,\r\nwas smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens, when her aunt\r\nexclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the\r\nhorse were streaked black with fast riding. Maggie felt a beating at\r\nhead and heart, horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage\r\nenemy who had feigned death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss, seeing in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face the\r\nevidence that she knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Mr Stephen Guest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, rather faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a gentleman who is very intimate at my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen was already close to them, had jumped off his horse, and now\r\nraised his hat as he advanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold the horse, Willy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, pulling at the horse\xe2\x80\x99s impatiently\r\ntossing head. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be going again immediately. I have a message to\r\ndeliver to you, Miss Tulliver, on private business. May I take the\r\nliberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a half-jaded, half-irritated look, such as a man gets when he\r\nhas been dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his bed and his\r\ndinner of little use to him. He spoke almost abruptly, as if his errand\r\nwere too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be\r\nthought by Mrs Moss of his visit and request. Good Mrs Moss, rather\r\nnervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman, was\r\ninwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong to invite\r\nhim again to leave his horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling all the\r\nembarrassment of the situation, and unable to say anything, put on her\r\nbonnet, and turned to walk toward the gate.\r\n\r\nStephen turned too, and walked by her side, leading his horse.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked\r\nfour or five yards, when Maggie, who had been looking straight before\r\nher all the while, turned again to walk back, saying, with haughty\r\nresentment,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for me to go any farther. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you\r\nconsider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position\r\nthat forced me to come out with you, or whether you wished to insult me\r\nstill further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are angry with me for coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, bitterly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer; it is only\r\nyour woman\xe2\x80\x99s dignity that you care about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie gave a slight start, such as might have come from the slightest\r\npossible electric shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if it were not enough that I\xe2\x80\x99m entangled in this way; that I\xe2\x80\x99m mad\r\nwith love for you; that I resist the strongest passion a man can feel,\r\nbecause I try to be true to other claims; but you must treat me as if I\r\nwere a coarse brute, who would willingly offend you. And when, if I had\r\nmy own choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my\r\nwhole life, and do what you liked with them! I know I forgot myself. I\r\ntook an unwarrantable liberty. I hate myself for having done it. But I\r\nrepented immediately; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been repenting ever since. You ought not to\r\nthink it unpardonable; a man who loves with his whole soul, as I do\r\nyou, is liable to be mastered by his feelings for a moment; but you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94you must believe\xe2\x80\x94that the worst pain I could have is to have\r\npained you; that I would give the world to recall the error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie dared not speak, dared not turn her head. The strength that had\r\ncome from resentment was all gone, and her lips were quivering visibly.\r\nShe could not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness that rose in\r\nanswer to that confession.\r\n\r\nThey were come nearly in front of the gate again, and she paused,\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not say these things; I must not hear them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nlooking down in misery, as Stephen came in front of her, to prevent her\r\nfrom going farther toward the gate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for any pain you\r\nhave to go through; but it is of no use to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ of use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be of use\r\nif you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration, instead\r\nof doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could bear everything more\r\nquietly if I knew you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hate me for an insolent coxcomb. Look at\r\nme; see what a hunted devil I am; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been riding thirty miles every\r\nday to get away from the thought of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie did not\xe2\x80\x94dared not\xe2\x80\x94look. She had already seen the harassed face.\r\nBut she said gently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think any evil of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, dearest, look at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, in deepest, tenderest tones\r\nof entreaty. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away from me yet. Give me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s happiness;\r\nmake me feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgiven me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do forgive you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, shaken by those tones, and all\r\nthe more frightened at herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut pray let me go in again. Pray go\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go away from you; I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, with still\r\nmore passionate pleading. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall come back again if you send me away\r\nwith this coldness; I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for myself. But if you will go with\r\nme only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly enough that\r\nyour anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited\r\nremonstrances against this frequent change of direction, that Stephen,\r\ncatching sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate, called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! just come and hold my horse for five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cmy aunt will think it so strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen answered impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know the people\r\nat St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Lead him up and down just here for five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nto Willy, who was now close to them; and then he turned to Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, and they walked on. It was clear that she _must_ go on now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, entreatingly; and she took it, feeling all\r\nthe while as if she were sliding downward in a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no end to this misery,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, struggling to repel the\r\ninfluence by speech. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is wicked\xe2\x80\x94base\xe2\x80\x94ever allowing a word or look\r\nthat Lucy\xe2\x80\x94that others might not have seen. Think of Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think of her\xe2\x80\x94bless her. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen had laid his hand\r\non Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s that rested on his arm, and they both felt it difficult to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have other ties,\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie went on, at last, with a desperate\r\neffort, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if Lucy did not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are engaged to Philip Wakem?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider myself engaged to him; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to marry any one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a\r\nside lane, all grassy and sheltered. Then he burst out impetuously,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love\r\nyou, we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of\r\nbelonging to each other. We should break all these mistaken ties that\r\nwere made in blindness, and determine to marry each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather die than fall into that temptation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with\r\ndeep, slow distinctness, all the gathered spiritual force of painful\r\nyears coming to her aid in this extremity. She drew her arm from his as\r\nshe spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, then, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, almost violently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me that you love some one else better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt darted through Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s mind that here was a mode of releasing\r\nherself from outward struggle,\xe2\x80\x94to tell Stephen that her whole heart was\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s. But her lips would not utter that, and she was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do love me, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, gently, taking her hand\r\nagain and laying it within his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cit is better\xe2\x80\x94it is right that we\r\nshould marry each other. We can\xe2\x80\x99t help the pain it will give. It is\r\ncome upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of\r\nme in spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen trying to be faithful to tacit engagements, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only made\r\nthings worse; I\xe2\x80\x99d better have given way at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was silent. If it were _not_ wrong\xe2\x80\x94if she were once convinced of\r\nthat, and need no longer beat and struggle against this current, soft\r\nand yet strong as the summer stream!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, leaning to look entreatingly in her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could we care about in the whole world beside, if we\r\nbelonged to each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer breath was on his face, his lips were very near hers, but there was\r\na great dread dwelling in his love for her.\r\n\r\nHer lips and eyelids quivered; she opened her eyes full on his for an\r\ninstant, like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses,\r\nand then turned sharp round toward home again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat his\r\nown scruples as well as hers, \xe2\x80\x9cI am breaking no positive engagement; if\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one\r\nelse, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her. If you are\r\nnot absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that; it is not your real feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie,\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel, as I do, that the real tie lies in the feelings\r\nand expectations we have raised in other minds. Else all pledges might\r\nbe broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such\r\nthing as faithfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen was silent; he could not pursue that argument; the opposite\r\nconviction had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of\r\nstruggle. But it soon presented itself in a new form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pledge _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be fulfilled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with impetuous insistence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unnatural; we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one\r\nelse. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery in it for _them_\r\nas well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance;\r\nhis large, firm, gentle grasp was on her hand. She was silent for a few\r\nmoments, with her eyes fixed on the ground; then she drew a deep\r\nbreath, and said, looking up at him with solemn sadness,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is difficult,\xe2\x80\x94life is very difficult! It seems right to me\r\nsometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such\r\nfeelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has\r\nmade for us,\xe2\x80\x94the ties that have made others dependent on us,\xe2\x80\x94and would\r\ncut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might have\r\nbeen in Paradise, and we could always see that one being first toward\r\nwhom\xe2\x80\x94I mean, if life did not make duties for us before love comes, love\r\nwould be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other. But I\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94I feel it is not so now; there are things we must renounce in life;\r\nsome of us must resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me;\r\nbut I see one thing quite clearly,\xe2\x80\x94that I must not, cannot, seek my own\r\nhappiness by sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely pity and\r\nfaithfulness and memory are natural too. And they would live in me\r\nstill, and punish me if I did not obey them. I should be haunted by the\r\nsuffering I had caused. Our love would be poisoned. Don\xe2\x80\x99t urge me; help\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94help me, _because_ I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie had become more and more earnest as she went on; her face had\r\nbecome flushed, and her eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love.\r\nStephen had the fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated to her appeal;\r\nbut in the same moment\xe2\x80\x94how could it be otherwise?\xe2\x80\x94that pleading beauty\r\ngained new power over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his arm\r\nstole round her, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear anything you wish. But\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nkiss\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x94the last\xe2\x80\x94before we part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne kiss, and then a long look, until Maggie said tremulously, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\ngo,\xe2\x80\x94let me make haste back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hurried along, and not another word was spoken. Stephen stood still\r\nand beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse, and\r\nMaggie went on through the gate. Mrs Moss was standing alone at the\r\ndoor of the old porch; she had sent all the cousins in, with kind\r\nthoughtfulness. It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and\r\nhandsome lover, but she would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in\r\nagain; and it might _not_ be joyful. In either case Mrs Moss waited\r\nanxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face told plainly\r\nenough that, if there was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down here a bit, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew Maggie into the porch, and sat\r\ndown on the bench by her; there was no privacy in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt Gritty, I\xe2\x80\x99m very wretched! I wish I could have died when I\r\nwas fifteen. It seemed so easy to give things up then; it is so hard\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor child threw her arms round her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and fell into\r\nlong, deep sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nA Family Party\r\n\r\nMaggie left her good aunt Gritty at the end of the week, and went to\r\nGarum Firs to pay her visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement. In\r\nthe mean time very unexpected things had happened, and there was to be\r\na family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the\r\nfortunes of the Tullivers, which was likely finally to carry away the\r\nshadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse, and cause\r\ntheir hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full-rounded\r\nsplendor. It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into\r\noffice are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high\r\nappreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families\r\nthroughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a\r\nsimilar cordiality of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the\r\ncoercion of any antecedents, suggests the hopeful possibility that we\r\nmay some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium, with\r\ncockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer show\r\ntheir teeth with any but the blandest intentions.\r\n\r\nLucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she\r\nlonged to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful\r\nnews. It seemed, did it not? said Lucy, with her prettiest air of\r\nwisdom, as if everything, even other people\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes (poor\r\ncreatures!) were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver, and\r\ncousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she were not obstinately bent on\r\nthe contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles.\r\nTo think that the very day\xe2\x80\x94the _very day_\xe2\x80\x94after Tom had come back from\r\nNewcastle, that unfortunate young Jetsome, whom Mr Wakem had placed at\r\nthe Mill, had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit, and was\r\nlying at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s in a dangerous state, so that Wakem had signified his\r\nwish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once!\r\n\r\nIt was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if\r\nthe misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in\r\norder that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his\r\nexemplary conduct,\xe2\x80\x94papa thought so very highly of him. Aunt Tulliver\r\nmust certainly go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was\r\nrather a loss to Lucy in the matter of household comfort; but then, to\r\nthink of poor aunty being in her old place again, and gradually getting\r\ncomforts about her there!\r\n\r\nOn this last point Lucy had her cunning projects, and when she and\r\nMaggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the\r\nhandsome parlour, where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than\r\nelsewhere, she directed her man\xc5\x93uvres, as any other great tactician\r\nwould have done, against the weaker side of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, seating herself on the sofa, and caressingly\r\nadjusting that lady\xe2\x80\x99s floating cap-string, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to make up your\r\nmind what linen and things you will give Tom toward housekeeping;\r\nbecause you are always so generous,\xe2\x80\x94you give such nice things, you\r\nknow; and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she never can, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, with unusual vigor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the linen to follow suit wi\xe2\x80\x99 mine, I can tell you.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d niver the taste, not if she\xe2\x80\x99d spend the money. Big checks and\r\nlive things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen is,\xe2\x80\x94not a spot\r\nnor a diamond among \xe2\x80\x99em. But it\xe2\x80\x99s poor work dividing one\xe2\x80\x99s linen before\r\none dies,\xe2\x80\x94I niver thought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 done that, Bessy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Pullet\r\ncontinued, shaking her head and looking at her sister Tulliver, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nyou and me chose the double diamont, the first flax iver we\xe2\x80\x99d spun, and\r\nthe Lord knows where yours is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no choice, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs Tulliver, accustomed\r\nto consider herself in the light of an accused person. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was\r\nno wish o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, iver, as I should lie awake o\xe2\x80\x99 nights thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nbest bleached linen all over the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a peppermint, Mrs Tulliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Pullet, feeling that he\r\nwas offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort, which he was\r\nrecommending by example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, aunt Pullet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve so much beautiful linen. And\r\nsuppose you had had daughters! Then you must have divided it when they\r\nwere married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say as I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cfor now Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso lucky, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but right his friends should look on him and\r\nhelp him. There\xe2\x80\x99s the tablecloths I bought at your sale, Bessy; it was\r\nnothing but good natur\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 me to buy \xe2\x80\x99em, for they\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying in the\r\nchest ever since. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give Maggie any more o\xe2\x80\x99 my Indy\r\nmuslin and things, if she\xe2\x80\x99s to go into service again, when she might\r\nstay and keep me company, and do my sewing for me, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted\r\nat her brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing into service\xe2\x80\x9d was the expression by which the Dodson mind\r\nrepresented to itself the position of teacher or governess; and\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s return to that menial condition, now circumstances offered her\r\nmore eligible prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all her\r\nrelatives, besides Lucy. Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down\r\nher back, and altogether in a state of dubious promise, was a most\r\nundesirable niece; but now she was capable of being at once ornamental\r\nand useful. The subject was revived in aunt and uncle Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nover the tea and muffins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, hegh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the back,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnonsense, nonsense! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us hear of you taking a place again,\r\nMaggie. Why, you must ha\xe2\x80\x99 picked up half-a-dozen sweethearts at the\r\nbazaar; isn\xe2\x80\x99t there one of \xe2\x80\x99em the right sort of article? Come, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, with that shade of increased politeness in\r\nher severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexcuse me, but you\xe2\x80\x99re far too light for a man of your years. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespect and duty to her aunts, and the rest of her kin as are so good\r\nto her, should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again\r\nwithout consulting us; not sweethearts, if I\xe2\x80\x99m to use such a word,\r\nthough it was never heared in _my_ family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what did they call us, when we went to see \xe2\x80\x99em, then, eh,\r\nneighbour Pullet? They thought us sweet enough then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg,\r\nwinking pleasantly; while Mr Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness,\r\ntook a little more sugar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs G., \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be undelicate, let me\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, Jane, your husband\xe2\x80\x99s only joking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet; \xe2\x80\x9clet him joke\r\nwhile he\xe2\x80\x99s got health and strength. There\xe2\x80\x99s poor Mr Tilt got his mouth\r\ndrawn all o\xe2\x80\x99 one side, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh if he was to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr Glegg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs G., \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nI may be so bold to interrupt your joking. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s other people\r\nmust see the joke in a niece\xe2\x80\x99s putting a slight on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s eldest\r\nsister, as is the head o\xe2\x80\x99 the family; and only coming in and out on\r\nshort visits, all the time she\xe2\x80\x99s been in the town, and then settling to\r\ngo away without my knowledge,\xe2\x80\x94as I\xe2\x80\x99d laid caps out on purpose for her\r\nto make \xe2\x80\x99em up for me,\xe2\x80\x94and me as have divided my money so equal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Tulliver broke in anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Maggie never\r\nthought o\xe2\x80\x99 going away without staying at your house as well as the\r\nothers. Not as it\xe2\x80\x99s my wish she should go away at all, but quite\r\ncontrairy. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m innocent. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said over and over again, \xe2\x80\x98My\r\ndear, you\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to go away.\xe2\x80\x99 But there\xe2\x80\x99s ten days or a fortnight\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99ll have before she\xe2\x80\x99s fixed to go; she can stay at your house\r\njust as well, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll step in when I can, and so will Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99d exercise a little more thought, you\r\nmight know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed, and\r\ngo to all that trouble now, just at the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the time, when our house\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t above a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk from Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s. She can come\r\nthe first thing in the morning, and go back the last at night, and be\r\nthankful she\xe2\x80\x99s got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with. I\r\nknow _I_ should, when I was her age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pullet, \xe2\x80\x9cit \xe2\x80\x99ud do your beds good to have somebody\r\nto sleep in \xe2\x80\x99em. There\xe2\x80\x99s that striped room smells dreadful mouldy, and\r\nthe glass mildewed like anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I thought I should be struck\r\nwith death when you took me in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there is Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy, clapping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s come on\r\nSindbad, as I told him. I was afraid he was not going to keep his\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at\r\nthis first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been\r\nopened to him; and she kept his hand, leading him to the chair by her\r\nside. To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a perpetual\r\nyearning in her, that had its root deeper than all change. He smiled at\r\nher very kindly this evening, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Magsie, how\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\r\nMoss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Glegg putting out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsuch a big man, you carry all before you, it, seems. You\xe2\x80\x99re come into\r\nyour luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did; but I wish you\r\njoy, I wish you joy. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get the Mill all for your own again some\r\nday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. You won\xe2\x80\x99t stop half-way up the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll bear in mind as it\xe2\x80\x99s his mother\xe2\x80\x99s family as he owes\r\nit to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had them to take after, he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen poorly off. There was never any failures, nor lawing, nor\r\nwastefulness in our family, nor dying without wills\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor sudden deaths,\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt Pullet; \xe2\x80\x9callays the doctor called\r\nin. But Tom had the Dodson skin; I said that from the first. And I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what _you_ mean to do, sister Glegg, but I mean to give him\r\na tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say what more I shall do; but _that_ I shall do, and if I should\r\ndie to-morrow, Mr Pullet, you\xe2\x80\x99ll bear it in mind,\xe2\x80\x94though you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nblundering with the keys, and never remember as that on the third shelf\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the broad\r\nties,\xe2\x80\x94not the narrow-frilled uns,\xe2\x80\x94is the key of the drawer in the Blue\r\nRoom, where the key o\xe2\x80\x99 the Blue Closet is. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make a mistake, and I\r\nshall niver be worthy to know it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve a memory for my pills and\r\ndraughts, wonderful,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll allays say that of you,\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99re lost among\r\nthe keys.\xe2\x80\x9d This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on\r\nher decease was very affecting to Mrs Pullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou carry it too far, Sophy,\xe2\x80\x94that locking in and out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Glegg,\r\nin a tone of some disgust at this folly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go beyond your own\r\nfamily. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody can say I don\xe2\x80\x99t lock up; but I do what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreasonable, and no more. And as for the linen, I shall look out what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nserviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got cloth as has\r\nnever been whitened, better worth having than other people\xe2\x80\x99s fine\r\nholland; and I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down in it and think of his aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom thanked Mrs Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on\r\nher virtues; and Mr Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about\r\nMr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s intentions concerning steam.\r\n\r\nLucy had had her far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad.\r\nIt appeared, when it was time to go home, that the man-servant was to\r\nride the horse, and cousin Tom was to drive home his mother and Lucy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must sit by yourself, aunty,\xe2\x80\x9d said that contriving young lady,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I must sit by Tom; I\xe2\x80\x99ve a great deal to say to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not\r\npersuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she\r\nthought, with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of\r\nhis wish about the Mill, must become pliant and flexible. Her nature\r\nsupplied her with no key to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s; and she was puzzled as well as\r\npained to notice the unpleasant change on his countenance when she gave\r\nhim the history of the way in which Philip had used his influence with\r\nhis father. She had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of\r\npolicy, which was to turn Tom\xe2\x80\x99s heart toward Philip at once, and,\r\nbesides that, prove that the elder Wakem was ready to receive Maggie\r\nwith all the honours of a daughter-in-law. Nothing was wanted, then,\r\nbut for dear Tom, who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at\r\ncousin Lucy, to turn completely round, say the opposite of what he had\r\nalways said before, and declare that he, for his part, was delighted\r\nthat all the old grievances should be healed, and that Maggie should\r\nhave Philip with all suitable despatch; in cousin Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\r\nnothing could be easier.\r\n\r\nBut to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities\r\nthat create severity,\xe2\x80\x94strength of will, conscious rectitude of purpose,\r\nnarrowness of imagination and intellect, great power of self-control,\r\nand a disposition to exert control over others,\xe2\x80\x94prejudices come as the\r\nnatural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that\r\ncomplex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking knowledge which we call truth.\r\nLet a prejudice be bequeathed, carried in the air, adopted by hearsay,\r\ncaught in through the eye,\xe2\x80\x94however it may come, these minds will give\r\nit a habitation; it is something to assert strongly and bravely,\r\nsomething to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas, something to impose\r\non others with the authority of conscious right; it is at once a staff\r\nand a baton. Every prejudice that will answer these purposes is\r\nself-evident. Our good, upright Tom Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s mind was of this class;\r\nhis inward criticism of his father\xe2\x80\x99s faults did not prevent him from\r\nadopting his father\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice; it was a prejudice against a man of\r\nlax principle and lax life, and it was a meeting-point for all the\r\ndisappointed feelings of family and personal pride. Other feelings\r\nadded their force to produce Tom\xe2\x80\x99s bitter repugnance to Philip, and to\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s union with him; and notwithstanding Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s power over her\r\nstrong-willed cousin, she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to\r\nsanction such a marriage; \xe2\x80\x9cbut of course Maggie could do as she\r\nliked,\xe2\x80\x94she had declared her determination to be independent. For Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, he held himself bound by his duty to his father\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and by\r\nevery manly feeling, never to consent to any relation with the Wakems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, all that Lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s mind with the expectation that Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s perverse resolve to go\r\ninto a situation again would presently metamorphose itself, as her\r\nresolves were apt to do, into something equally perverse, but entirely\r\ndifferent,\xe2\x80\x94a marriage with Philip Wakem.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nBorne Along by the Tide\r\n\r\nIn less than a week Maggie was at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s again,\xe2\x80\x94outwardly in much the\r\nsame position as when her visit there had just begun. It was easy for\r\nher to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort;\r\nfor she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg, and it was\r\nnatural that she should give her mother more than usual of her\r\ncompanionship in these last weeks, especially as there were\r\npreparations to be thought of for Tom\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping. But Lucy would\r\nhear of no pretext for her remaining away in the evenings; she must\r\nalways come from aunt Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s before dinner,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9celse what shall I have of\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a tearful pout that could not be resisted.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\noften as possible, instead of avoiding that, as he used to do. At first\r\nhe began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there,\r\nnot even go in the evening, till Maggie was away. He had even devised a\r\nplan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable June weather; the\r\nheadaches which he had constantly been alleging as a ground for\r\nstupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive. But the\r\njourney was not taken, and by the fourth morning no distinct resolution\r\nwas formed about the evenings; they were only foreseen as times when\r\nMaggie would still be present for a little while,\xe2\x80\x94when one more touch,\r\none more glance, might be snatched. For why not? There was nothing to\r\nconceal between them; they knew, they had confessed their love, and\r\nthey had renounced each other; they were going to part. Honour and\r\nconscience were going to divide them; Maggie, with that appeal from her\r\ninmost soul, had decided it; but surely they might cast a lingering\r\nlook at each other across the gulf, before they turned away never to\r\nlook again till that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes.\r\n\r\nMaggie, all this time, moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of\r\nmanner, so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that\r\nLucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change, if she\r\nhad not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between\r\nPhilip and her brother, and the prospect of her self-imposed wearisome\r\nbanishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount of\r\ndepression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of\r\nemotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or\r\nforeboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in\r\nambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous,\r\noverpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness\r\nseemed to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should\r\nnot Philip, suffer? _She_ had had to suffer through many years of her\r\nlife; and who had renounced anything for her? And when something like\r\nthat fulness of existence\xe2\x80\x94love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her\r\nnature craved\xe2\x80\x94was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it,\r\nthat another might have it,\xe2\x80\x94another, who perhaps needed it less? But\r\namidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making\r\nthemselves heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult\r\nseemed quelled. _Was_ that existence which tempted her the full\r\nexistence she dreamed? Where, then, would be all the memories of early\r\nstriving; all the deep pity for another\xe2\x80\x99s pain, which had been nurtured\r\nin her through years of affection and hardship; all the divine\r\npresentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment, which\r\nhad made the sacredness of life? She might as well hope to enjoy\r\nwalking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in which she\r\nset out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of\r\nher soul. And then, if pain were so hard to _her_, what was it to\r\nothers? \xe2\x80\x9cAh, God! preserve me from inflicting\xe2\x80\x94give me strength to bear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she\r\nwould once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate\r\ncrime? When was that first hateful moment in which she had been\r\nconscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and\r\ngratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had\r\nbeen a loathsome thing? And yet, since this strange, sweet, subduing\r\ninfluence did not, should not, conquer her,\xe2\x80\x94since it was to remain\r\nsimply her own suffering,\xe2\x80\x94her mind was meeting Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s in that\r\nthought of his, that they might still snatch moments of mute confession\r\nbefore the parting came. For was not he suffering too? She saw it\r\ndaily\xe2\x80\x94saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which, as soon as he\r\nwas not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference\r\ntoward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse\r\nsometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following\r\nher like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less,\r\ntill at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmutual gaze; they thought of it till it came, and when it had come,\r\nthey thought of nothing else.\r\n\r\nOne other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for, and that was\r\nto sing; it was a way of speaking to Maggie. Perhaps he was not\r\ndistinctly conscious that he was impelled to it by a secret\r\nlonging\xe2\x80\x94running counter to all his self-confessed resolves\xe2\x80\x94to deepen\r\nthe hold he had on her. Watch your own speech, and notice how it is\r\nguided by your less conscious purposes, and you will understand that\r\ncontradiction in Stephen.\r\n\r\nPhilip Wakem was a less frequent visitor, but he came occasionally in\r\nthe evening, and it happened that he was there when Lucy said, as they\r\nsat out on the lawn, near sunset,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed, I mean that we\r\nshall go out boating every day until she goes. She has not had half\r\nenough boating because of these tiresome visits, and she likes it\r\nbetter than anything. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than any sort of locomotion, I hope you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\r\nsmiling at Maggie, who was lolling backward in a low garden-chair;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9celse she will be selling her soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts\r\nthe Floss, only for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to be her boatman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if you would,\r\nyou can come with us and take an oar. If the Floss were but a quiet\r\nlake instead of a river, we should be independent of any gentleman, for\r\nMaggie can row splendidly. As it is, we are reduced to ask services of\r\nknights and squires, who do not seem to offer them with great\r\nalacrity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked playful reproach at Stephen, who was sauntering up and down,\r\nand was just singing in pianissimo falsetto,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe thirst that from the soul doth rise\r\n     Doth ask a drink divine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe took no notice, but still kept aloof; he had done so frequently\r\nduring Philip\xe2\x80\x99s recent visits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem inclined for boating,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, when he came to sit\r\ndown by her on the bench. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t rowing suit you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hate a large party in a boat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, almost irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome when you have no one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy coloured, fearing that Philip would be hurt; it was quite a new\r\nthing for Stephen to speak in that way; but he had certainly not been\r\nwell of late. Philip coloured too, but less from a feeling of personal\r\noffence than from a vague suspicion that Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s moodiness had some\r\nrelation to Maggie, who had started up from her chair as he spoke, and\r\nhad walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending\r\nsunlight on the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Miss Deane didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was excluding others by inviting me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cI am bound to resign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, you shall not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, much vexed. \xe2\x80\x9cI particularly\r\nwish for your company to-morrow. The tide will suit at half-past ten;\r\nit will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth\r\nand walk back, before the sun gets too hot. And how can you object to\r\nfour people in a boat?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking at Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t object to the people, but the number,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, who had\r\nrecovered himself, and was rather ashamed of his rudeness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I voted\r\nfor a fourth at all, of course it would be you, Phil. But we won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndivide the pleasure of escorting the ladies; we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it alternately.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go the next day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis incident had the effect of drawing Philip\xe2\x80\x99s attention with\r\nfreshened solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie; but when they\r\nre-entered the house, music was proposed, and Mrs Tulliver and Mr Deane\r\nbeing occupied with cribbage, Maggie sat apart near the table where the\r\nbooks and work were placed, doing nothing, however, but listening\r\nabstractedly to the music. Stephen presently turned to a duet which he\r\ninsisted that Lucy and Philip should sing; he had often done the same\r\nthing before; but this evening Philip thought he divined some double\r\nintention in every word and look of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, and watched him keenly,\r\nangry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion. For had\r\nnot Maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side? And\r\nshe was truth itself; it was impossible not to believe her word and\r\nglance when they had last spoken together in the garden. Stephen might\r\nbe strongly fascinated by her (what was more natural?), but Philip felt\r\nhimself rather base for intruding on what must be his friend\xe2\x80\x99s painful\r\nsecret. Still he watched. Stephen, moving away from the piano,\r\nsauntered slowly toward the table near which Maggie sat, and turned\r\nover the newspapers, apparently in mere idleness. Then he seated\r\nhimself with his back to the piano, dragging a newspaper under his\r\nelbow, and thrusting his hand through his hair, as if he had been\r\nattracted by some bit of local news in the \xe2\x80\x9cLaceham Courier.\xe2\x80\x9d He was in\r\nreality looking at Maggie who had not taken the slightest notice of his\r\napproach. She had always additional strength of resistance when Philip\r\nwas present, just as we can restrain our speech better in a spot that\r\nwe feel to be hallowed. But at last she heard the word \xe2\x80\x9cdearest\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nuttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty, like that of a patient\r\nwho asks for something that ought to have been given without asking.\r\nShe had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at Basset,\r\nwhen it had come from Stephen again and again, almost as involuntarily\r\nas if it had been an inarticulate cry. Philip could hear no word, but\r\nhe had moved to the opposite side of the piano, and could see Maggie\r\nstart and blush, raise her eyes an instant toward Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face, but\r\nimmediately look apprehensively toward himself. It was not evident to\r\nher that Philip had observed her; but a pang of shame, under the sense\r\nof this concealment, made her move from her chair and walk to her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s side to watch the game at cribbage.\r\n\r\nPhilip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with\r\nwretched certainty. It was impossible for him now to resist the\r\nconviction that there was some mutual consciousness between Stephen and\r\nMaggie; and for half the night his irritable, susceptible nerves were\r\npressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact; he could\r\nattempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her words and\r\nactions. When, at last, the need for belief in Maggie rose to its\r\nhabitual predominance, he was not long in imagining the truth,\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nstruggling, she was banishing herself; this was the clue to all he had\r\nseen since his return. But athwart that belief there came other\r\npossibilities that would not be driven out of sight. His imagination\r\nwrought out the whole story; Stephen was madly in love with her; he\r\nmust have told her so; she had rejected him, and was hurrying away. But\r\nwould he give her up, knowing\xe2\x80\x94Philip felt the fact with heart-crushing\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94that she was made half helpless by her feeling toward him?\r\n\r\nWhen the morning came, Philip was too ill to think of keeping his\r\nengagement to go in the boat. In his present agitation he could decide\r\non nothing; he could only alternate between contradictory intentions.\r\nFirst, he thought he must have an interview with Maggie, and entreat\r\nher to confide in him; then, again, he distrusted his own interference.\r\nHad he not been thrusting himself on Maggie all along? She had uttered\r\nwords long ago in her young ignorance; it was enough to make her hate\r\nhim that these should be continually present with her as a bond. And\r\nhad he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had\r\nevidently intended to withhold from him? He would not trust himself to\r\nsee her, till he had assured himself that he could act from pure\r\nanxiety for her, and not from egoistic irritation. He wrote a brief\r\nnote to Stephen, and sent it early by the servant, saying that he was\r\nnot well enough to fulfil his engagement to Miss Deane. Would Stephen\r\ntake his excuse, and fill his place?\r\n\r\nLucy had arranged a charming plan, which had made her quite content\r\nwith Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to go in the boat. She discovered that her\r\nfather was to drive to Lindum this morning at ten; Lindum was the very\r\nplace she wanted to go to, to make purchases,\xe2\x80\x94important purchases,\r\nwhich must by no means be put off to another opportunity; and aunt\r\nTulliver must go too, because she was concerned in some of the\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have your row in the boat just the same, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nto Maggie when they went out of the breakfast-room and upstairs\r\ntogether; \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip will be here at half-past ten, and it is a delicious\r\nmorning. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word against it, you dear dolorous thing. What\r\nis the use of my being a fairy godmother, if you set your face against\r\nall the wonders I work for you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of awful cousin Tom; you\r\nmay disobey him a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie did not persist in objecting. She was almost glad of the plan,\r\nfor perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone\r\nwith Philip again; it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life,\r\nin which the very struggles were repose, compared with the daily tumult\r\nof the present. She prepared herself for the boat and at half-past ten\r\nsat waiting in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe ring of the door-bell was punctual, and she was thinking with\r\nhalf-sad, affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in\r\nfinding that he was to be with her alone, when she distinguished a\r\nfirm, rapid step across the hall, that was certainly not Philip\xe2\x80\x99s; the\r\ndoor opened, and Stephen Guest entered.\r\n\r\nIn the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak; for\r\nStephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out.\r\nMaggie had started up and sat down again, with her heart beating\r\nviolently; and Stephen, throwing down his cap and gloves, came and sat\r\nby her in silence. She thought Philip would be coming soon; and with\r\ngreat effort\xe2\x80\x94for she trembled visibly\xe2\x80\x94she rose to go to a distant\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going in the\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we can\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, sinking into her chair again. \xe2\x80\x9cLucy did\r\nnot expect\xe2\x80\x94she would be hurt. Why is not Philip come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not well; he asked me to come instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy is gone to Lindum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, taking off her bonnet with\r\nhurried, trembling fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, dreamily, looking at her, as he rested his\r\narm on the back of his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking into her deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the\r\nstarlit blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving. Maggie sat\r\nperfectly still\xe2\x80\x94perhaps for moments, perhaps for minutes\xe2\x80\x94until the\r\nhelpless trembling had ceased, and there was a warm glow on her check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is waiting; he has taken the cushions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go\r\nand tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, almost in a whisper. He was\r\nlooking at the lips now.\r\n\r\nMaggie made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, and taking her hand\r\nto raise her too. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not be long together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they went. Maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among\r\nthe roses, being helped with firm, tender care into the boat, having\r\nthe cushion and cloak arranged for her feet, and her parasol opened for\r\nher (which she had forgotten), all by this stronger presence that\r\nseemed to bear her along without any act of her own will, like the\r\nadded self which comes with the sudden exalting influence of a strong\r\ntonic, and she felt nothing else. Memory was excluded.\r\n\r\nThey glided rapidly along, Stephen rowing, helped by the\r\nbackward-flowing tide, past the Tofton trees and houses; on between the\r\nsilent sunny fields and pastures, which seemed filled with a natural\r\njoy that had no reproach for theirs. The breath of the young, unwearied\r\nday, the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars, the fragmentary song of a\r\npassing bird heard now and then, as if it were only the overflowing of\r\nbrimful gladness, the sweet solitude of a twofold consciousness that\r\nwas mingled into one by that grave, untiring gaze which need not be\r\naverted,\xe2\x80\x94what else could there be in their minds for the first hour?\r\nSome low, subdued, languid exclamation of love came from Stephen from\r\ntime to time, as he went on rowing idly, half automatically; otherwise\r\nthey spoke no word; for what could words have been but an inlet to\r\nthought? and thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which\r\nthey were enveloped,\xe2\x80\x94it belonged to the past and the future that lay\r\noutside the haze. Maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks, as they\r\npassed them, and dwelt with no recognition on the villages; she knew\r\nthere were several to be passed before they reached Luckreth, where\r\nthey always stopped and left the boat. At all times she was so liable\r\nto fits of absence, that she was likely enough to let her waymarks pass\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\nBut at last Stephen, who had been rowing more and more idly, ceased to\r\nrow, laid down the oars, folded his arms, and looked down on the water\r\nas if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help. This\r\nsudden change roused Maggie. She looked at the far-stretching fields,\r\nat the banks close by, and felt that they were entirely strange to her.\r\nA terrible alarm took possession of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, have we passed Luckreth, where we were to stop?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed,\r\nlooking back to see if the place were out of sight. No village was to\r\nbe seen. She turned around again, with a look of distressed questioning\r\nat Stephen.\r\n\r\nHe went on watching the water, and said, in a strange, dreamy, absent\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, a long way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maggie, in an agony. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not get\r\nhome for hours, and Lucy? O God, help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child;\r\nshe thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy, and seeing her look of\r\npained surprise and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding.\r\n\r\nStephen moved and sat near her, and gently drew down the clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a deep tone of slow decision, \xe2\x80\x9clet us never go\r\nhome again, till no one can part us,\xe2\x80\x94till we are married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s sob, and she\r\nsat quite still, wondering; as if Stephen might have seen some\r\npossibilities that would alter everything, and annul the wretched\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,\xe2\x80\x94in spite of\r\nall our efforts. We never thought of being alone together again; it has\r\nall been done by others. See how the tide is carrying us out, away from\r\nall those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round\r\nus, and trying in vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can land\r\nthere, and get some carriage, and hurry on to York and then to\r\nScotland,\xe2\x80\x94and never pause a moment till we are bound to each other, so\r\nthat only death can part us. It is the only right thing, dearest; it is\r\nthe only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement. Everything\r\nhas concurred to point it out to us. We have contrived nothing, we have\r\nthought of nothing ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing\r\nfrom her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the\r\ntide was doing it all, that she might glide along with the swift,\r\nsilent stream, and not struggle any more. But across that stealing\r\ninfluence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts; and the sudden\r\nhorror lest now, at last, the moment of fatal intoxication was close\r\nupon her, called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant look\r\nat him, and trying to get her hands free. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have wanted to deprive\r\nme of any choice. You knew we were come too far; you have dared to take\r\nadvantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into such a\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStung by this reproach, he released her hands, moved back to his former\r\nplace, and folded his arms, in a sort of desperation at the difficulty\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s words had made present to him. If she would not consent to go\r\non, he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her into.\r\nBut the reproach was the unendurable thing; the one thing worse than\r\nparting with her was, that she should feel he had acted unworthily\r\ntoward her. At last he said, in a tone of suppressed rage,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the\r\nnext village; and then it came into my mind that we would go on. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t justify it; I ought to have told you. It is enough to make you\r\nhate me, since you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me well enough to make everything else\r\nindifferent to you, as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get\r\nyou out here? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and\r\nyou shall be clear of me forever. No one can blame you, because I have\r\nbehaved unpardonably to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s pleading than\r\nthis picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was\r\nvindicated; easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than\r\nfrom this look of angry misery, that seemed to place her in selfish\r\nisolation from him. He had called up a state of feeling in which the\r\nreasons which had acted on her conscience seemed to be transmitted into\r\nmere self-regard. The indignant fire in her eyes was quenched, and she\r\nbegan to look at him with timid distress. She had reproached him for\r\nbeing hurried into irrevocable trespass,\xe2\x80\x94she, who had been so weak\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel what happened to you\xe2\x80\x94just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith reproach of another kind,\xe2\x80\x94the reproach of love, asking for more\r\ntrust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s suffering was more fatal\r\nthan the other yielding, because it was less distinguishable from that\r\nsense of others\xe2\x80\x99 claims which was the moral basis of her resistance.\r\n\r\nHe felt all the relenting in her look and tone; it was heaven opening\r\nagain. He moved to her side, and took her hand, leaning his elbow on\r\nthe back of the boat, and saying nothing. He dreaded to utter another\r\nword, he dreaded to make another movement, that might provoke another\r\nreproach or denial from her. Life hung on her consent; everything else\r\nwas hopeless, confused, sickening misery. They glided along in this\r\nway, both resting in that silence as in a haven, both dreading lest\r\ntheir feelings should be divided again,\xe2\x80\x94till they became aware that the\r\nclouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible freshening of\r\nthe breeze was growing and growing, so that the whole character of the\r\nday was altered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak\r\nover your shoulders. Get up an instant, dearest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do,\r\nand having everything decided for her. She sat down again covered with\r\nthe cloak, and Stephen took to his oars again, making haste; for they\r\nmust try to get to Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly\r\nconscious of having said or done anything decisive. All yielding is\r\nattended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance; it is the\r\npartial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of our own personality\r\nby another. Every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence. That\r\ndreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours, and had\r\nbrought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil of her fatigued\r\nsensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat\r\nat this unknown distance from home, and walking for long miles,\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nhelped to bring her into more complete subjection to that strong,\r\nmysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen seem the death\r\nof all joy, and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch\r\nof the torturing iron before which resolution shrank. And then there\r\nwas the present happiness of being with him, which was enough to absorb\r\nall her languid energy.\r\n\r\nPresently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several vessels,\r\namong them the steamer to Mudport, had passed them with the early tide,\r\nbut for the last hour they had seen none. He looked more and more\r\neagerly at this vessel, as if a new thought had come into his mind\r\nalong with it, and then he looked at Maggie hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cif this vessel should be going to\r\nMudport, or to any convenient place on the coast northward, it would be\r\nour best plan to get them to take us on board. You are fatigued, and it\r\nmay soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this\r\nboat. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be made\r\ntolerably comfortable. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the cushions out of the boat. It is\r\nreally our best plan. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad enough to take us. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nplenty of money about me. I can pay them well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new\r\nproposition; but she was silent,\xe2\x80\x94one course seemed as difficult as\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nStephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the\r\nEnglish mate informed him, and, if this wind held, would be there in\r\nless than two days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had got out too far with our boat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to\r\nmake for Torby. But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of the weather; and this lady\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger. Take us on board\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94and haul up the boat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was taken on board,\r\nmaking an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen. The\r\nmate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board, for they\r\nhad no accommodation for such entirely unlooked-for passengers,\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nprivate cabin larger than an old-fashioned church-pew. But at least\r\nthey had Dutch cleanliness, which makes all other inconveniences\r\ntolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for Maggie on\r\nthe poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and down the deck leaning on\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x94being upheld by his strength\xe2\x80\x94was the first change that she\r\nneeded; then came food, and then quiet reclining on the cushions, with\r\nthe sense that no new resolution _could_ be taken that day. Everything\r\nmust wait till to-morrow. Stephen sat beside her with her hand in his;\r\nthey could only speak to each other in low tones; only look at each\r\nother now and then, for it would take a long while to dull the\r\ncuriosity of the five men on board, and reduce these handsome young\r\nstrangers to that minor degree of interest which belongs, in a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nregard, to all objects nearer than the horizon. But Stephen was\r\ntriumphantly happy. Every other thought or care was thrown into\r\nunmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his. The leap\r\nhad been taken now; he had been tortured by scruples, he had fought\r\nfiercely with overmastering inclination, he had hesitated; but\r\nrepentance was impossible. He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences\r\nhis happiness, his adoration, his tenderness, his belief that their\r\nlife together must be heaven, that her presence with him would give\r\nrapture to every common day; that to satisfy her lightest wish was\r\ndearer to him than all other bliss; that everything was easy for her\r\nsake, except to part with her; and now they never _would_ part; he\r\nwould belong to her forever, and all that was his was hers,\xe2\x80\x94had no\r\nvalue for him except as it was hers. Such things, uttered in low,\r\nbroken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young\r\npassion, have only a feeble effect\xe2\x80\x94on experienced minds at a distance\r\nfrom them. To poor Maggie they were very near; they were like nectar\r\nheld close to thirsty lips; there was, there _must_ be, then, a life\r\nfor mortals here below which was not hard and chill,\xe2\x80\x94in which affection\r\nwould no longer be self-sacrifice. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s passionate words made the\r\nvision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been\r\nbefore; and the vision for the time excluded all realities,\xe2\x80\x94all except\r\nthe returning sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening\r\napproached, and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised\r\nhappiness; all except the hand that pressed hers, and the voice that\r\nspoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with grave, unspeakable\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThere was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the\r\nhorizon again, making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of\r\nthat wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x94the land that the evening star watches over. Maggie was to sleep\r\nall night on the poop; it was better than going below; and she was\r\ncovered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish. It was still\r\nearly, when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing for\r\nperfect rest, and she laid down her head, looking at the faint, dying\r\nflush in the west, where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and\r\nbrighter. Then she looked up at Stephen, who was still seated by her,\r\nhanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side. Behind\r\nall the delicious visions of these last hours, which had flowed over\r\nher like a soft stream, and made her entirely passive, there was the\r\ndim consciousness that the condition was a transient one, and that the\r\nmorrow must bring back the old life of struggle; that there were\r\nthoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion. But\r\nnow nothing was distinct to her; she was being lulled to sleep with\r\nthat soft stream still flowing over her, with those delicious visions\r\nmelting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nWaking\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his unaccustomed\r\namount of rowing, and with the intense inward life of the last twelve\r\nhours, but too restless to sleep, walked and lounged about the deck\r\nwith his cigar far on into midnight, not seeing the dark water, hardly\r\nconscious there were stars, living only in the near and distant future.\r\nAt last fatigue conquered restlessness, and he rolled himself up in a\r\npiece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nShe had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours\r\nbefore the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She\r\nawoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper\r\nrest. She was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen, and in the\r\ngathering darkness something like a star appeared, that grew and grew\r\ntill they saw it was the Virgin seated in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s boat, and it came\r\nnearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin was Lucy and the boatman\r\nwas Philip,\xe2\x80\x94no, not Philip, but her brother, who rowed past without\r\nlooking at her; and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him,\r\nand their own boat turned over with the movement, and they began to\r\nsink, till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake, and find she\r\nwas a child again in the parlour at evening twilight, and Tom was not\r\nreally angry. From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to\r\nthe real waking,\xe2\x80\x94to the plash of water against the vessel, and the\r\nsound of a footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit sky. There was a\r\nmoment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled\r\nfrom the confused web of dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth\r\nurged itself upon her. Stephen was not by her now; she was alone with\r\nher own memory and her own dread. The irrevocable wrong that must blot\r\nher life had been committed; she had brought sorrow into the lives of\r\nothers,\xe2\x80\x94into the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love.\r\nThe feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her\r\nnature had most recoiled from,\xe2\x80\x94breach of faith and cruel selfishness;\r\nshe had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made\r\nherself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her\r\nown passion. And where would that lead her? Where had it led her now?\r\nShe had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation. She\r\nfelt it now,\xe2\x80\x94now that the consequences of such a fall had come before\r\nthe outward act was completed. There was at least this fruit from all\r\nher years of striving after the highest and best,\xe2\x80\x94that her soul though\r\nbetrayed, beguiled, ensnared, could never deliberately consent to a\r\nchoice of the lower. And a choice of what? O God! not a choice of joy,\r\nbut of conscious cruelty and hardness; for could she ever cease to see\r\nbefore her Lucy and Philip, with their murdered trust and hopes? Her\r\nlife with Stephen could have no sacredness; she must forever sink and\r\nwander vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she had let go the\r\nclue of life,\xe2\x80\x94that clue which once in the far-off years her young need\r\nhad clutched so strongly. She had renounced all delights then, before\r\nshe knew them, before they had come within her reach. Philip had been\r\nright when he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation; she had\r\nthought it was quiet ecstasy; she saw it face to face now,\xe2\x80\x94that sad,\r\npatient, loving strength which holds the clue of life,\xe2\x80\x94and saw that the\r\nthorns were forever pressing on its brow. The yesterday, which could\r\nnever be revoked,\xe2\x80\x94if she could have changed it now for any length of\r\ninward silent endurance, she would have bowed beneath that cross with a\r\nsense of rest.\r\n\r\nDay break came and the reddening eastern light, while her past life was\r\ngrasping her in this way, with that tightening clutch which comes in\r\nthe last moments of possible rescue. She could see Stephen now lying on\r\nthe deck still fast asleep, and with the sight of him there came a wave\r\nof anguish that found its way in a long-suppressed sob. The worst\r\nbitterness of parting\xe2\x80\x94the thought that urged the sharpest inward cry\r\nfor help\xe2\x80\x94was the pain it must give to _him_. But surmounting everything\r\nwas the horror at her own possible failure, the dread lest her\r\nconscience should be benumbed again, and not rise to energy till it was\r\ntoo late. Too late! it was too late already not to have caused misery;\r\ntoo late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away from the last act of\r\nbaseness,\xe2\x80\x94the tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts.\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a day\r\nof resistance was beginning for her. Her eyelashes were still wet with\r\ntears, as, with her shawl over her head, she sat looking at the slowly\r\nrounding sun. Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his\r\nhard bed, he came to sit beside her. The sharp instinct of anxious love\r\nsaw something to give him alarm in the very first glance. He had a\r\nhovering dread of some resistance in Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s nature that he would be\r\nunable to overcome. He had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed\r\nher of perfect freedom yesterday; there was too much native honour in\r\nhim, for him not to feel that, if her will should recoil, his conduct\r\nwould have been odious, and she would have a right to reproach him.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie did not feel that right; she was too conscious of fatal\r\nweakness in herself, too full of the tenderness that comes with the\r\nforeseen need for inflicting a wound. She let him take her hand when he\r\ncame to sit down beside her, and smiled at him, only with rather a sad\r\nglance; she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible\r\nparting was nearer. And so they drank their cup of coffee together, and\r\nwalked about the deck, and heard the captain\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that they\r\nshould be in at Mudport by five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, each with an inward burthen;\r\nbut in him it was an undefined fear, which he trusted to the coming\r\nhours to dissipate; in her it was a definite resolve on which she was\r\ntrying silently to tighten her hold. Stephen was continually, through\r\nthe morning, expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she\r\nwas suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and\r\nrepose she would have in a carriage, wanting to assure himself more\r\ncompletely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged\r\nit. For a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that\r\nshe had had a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, and that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind about being\r\non the vessel,\xe2\x80\x94it was not like being on the open sea, it was only a\r\nlittle less pleasant than being in a boat on the Floss. But a\r\nsuppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes, and Stephen became\r\nmore and more uneasy as the day advanced, under the sense that Maggie\r\nhad entirely lost her passiveness. He longed, but did not dare, to\r\nspeak of their marriage, of where they would go after it, and the steps\r\nhe would take to inform his father, and the rest, of what had happened.\r\nHe longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her. But each time\r\nhe looked at her, he gathered a stronger dread of the new, quiet\r\nsadness with which she met his eyes. And they were more and more\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are in sight of Mudport,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, turning toward her with a look that was half beseeching, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nworst part of your fatigue is over. On the land we can command\r\nswiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together,\r\nand that will seem rest to you after this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to assent\r\nby silence. She spoke in the lowest tone, as he had done, but with\r\ndistinct decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not be together; we shall have parted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll die first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as he had dreaded\xe2\x80\x94there was a struggle coming. But neither of\r\nthem dared to say another word till the boat was let down, and they\r\nwere taken to the landing-place. Here there was a cluster of gazers and\r\npassengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Maggie\r\nhad a dim sense, when she had landed, and Stephen was hurrying her\r\nalong on his arm, that some one had advanced toward her from that\r\ncluster as if he were coming to speak to her. But she was hurried\r\nalong, and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial.\r\n\r\nA porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen\r\ngave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie\r\ntook no notice of this, and only said, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk them to show us into a room\r\nwhere we can sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face had\r\na desperate determination in it, was about to ring the bell, when she\r\nsaid, in a firm voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going; we must part here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning round toward her, and speaking in the tones\r\nof a man who feels a process of torture beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean to kill\r\nme? What is the use of it now? The whole thing is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much is done,\xe2\x80\x94more than we can\r\never remove the trace of. But I will go no farther. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\nprevail with me again. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t choose yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? He dared not go near her; her anger might leap out,\r\nand make a new barrier. He walked backward and forward in maddening\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, pausing before her, and speaking in a tone\r\nof imploring wretchedness, \xe2\x80\x9chave some pity\xe2\x80\x94hear me\xe2\x80\x94forgive me for what\r\nI did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will do nothing without your\r\nfull consent. But don\xe2\x80\x99t blight our lives forever by a rash perversity\r\nthat can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only create new\r\nevils. Sit down, dearest; wait\xe2\x80\x94think what you are going to do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntreat me as if you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s will was fixed\r\nunswervingly on the coming wrench. She had made up her mind to suffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low but distinct voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must\r\npart at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ part, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, more impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear it. What is the use of inflicting that misery on me? The\r\nblow\xe2\x80\x94whatever it may have been\xe2\x80\x94has been struck now. Will it help any\r\none else that you should drive me mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not begin any future, even for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, tremulously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been. What I told\r\nyou at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died than fall into this\r\ntemptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then.\r\nBut we must part now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will _not_ part,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen burst out, instinctively placing his back\r\nagainst the door, forgetting everything he had said a few moments\r\nbefore; \xe2\x80\x9cI will not endure it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make me desperate; I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie trembled. She felt that the parting could not be effected\r\nsuddenly. She must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s better self;\r\nshe must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while\r\nresolution was fresh. She sat down. Stephen, watching her with that\r\nlook of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light,\r\napproached slowly from the door, seated himself close beside her, and\r\ngrasped her hand. Her heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird;\r\nbut this direct opposition helped her. She felt her determination\r\ngrowing stronger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember what you felt weeks ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, with beseeching\r\nearnestness; \xe2\x80\x9cremember what we both felt,\xe2\x80\x94that we owed ourselves to\r\nothers, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to\r\nthat debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong\r\nremains the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it does _not_ remain the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have proved that\r\nit was impossible to keep our resolutions. We have proved that the\r\nfeeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome.\r\nThat natural law surmounts every other; we can\xe2\x80\x99t help what it clashes\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so, Stephen; I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure that is wrong. I have tried to\r\nthink it again and again; but I see, if we judged in that way, there\r\nwould be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty; we should justify\r\nbreaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the\r\npast is not to bind us, where can duty lie? We should have no law but\r\nthe inclination of the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are ties that can\xe2\x80\x99t be kept by mere resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStephen, starting up and walking about again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is outward\r\nfaithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as\r\nconstancy without love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie did not answer immediately. She was undergoing an inward as well\r\nas an outward contest. At last she said, with a passionate assertion of\r\nher conviction, as much against herself as against him,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems right\xe2\x80\x94at first; but when I look further, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it is\r\n_not_ right. Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides\r\ndoing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves. They mean\r\nrenouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x94whatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives\r\nhas made dependent on us. If we\xe2\x80\x94if I had been better, nobler, those\r\nclaims would have been so strongly present with me,\xe2\x80\x94I should have felt\r\nthem pressing on my heart so continually, just as they do now in the\r\nmoments when my conscience is awake,\xe2\x80\x94that the opposite feeling would\r\nnever have grown in me, as it has done; it would have been quenched at\r\nonce, I should have prayed for help so earnestly, I should have rushed\r\naway as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no excuse for myself, none.\r\nI should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I have done, if I\r\nhad not been weak, selfish, and hard,\xe2\x80\x94able to think of their pain\r\nwithout a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation. Oh,\r\nwhat is Lucy feeling now? She believed in me\xe2\x80\x94she loved me\xe2\x80\x94she was so\r\ngood to me. Think of her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ think of her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, stamping as if with pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan think of nothing but you, Maggie. You demand of a man what is\r\nimpossible. I felt that once; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to it now. And where\r\nis the use of _your_ thinking of it, except to torture me? You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsave them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and make\r\nmy life worthless to me. And even if we could go back, and both fulfil\r\nour engagements,\xe2\x80\x94if that were possible now,\xe2\x80\x94it would be hateful,\r\nhorrible, to think of your ever being Philip\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x94of your ever being\r\nthe wife of a man you didn\xe2\x80\x99t love. We have both been rescued from a\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep flush came over Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak. Stephen\r\nsaw this. He sat down again, taking her hand in his, and looking at her\r\nwith passionate entreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great a\r\nclaim on you as I have? My life is bound up in your love. There is\r\nnothing in the past that can annul our right to each other; it is the\r\nfirst time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was\r\nin a flutter of new hope; he was going to triumph. But she raised her\r\neyes and met his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of\r\nregret, not with yielding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with timid\r\nresolution. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never consented to it with my whole mind. There are\r\nmemories, and affections, and longings after perfect goodness, that\r\nhave such a strong hold on me; they would never quit me for long; they\r\nwould come back and be pain to me\xe2\x80\x94repentance. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in peace\r\nif I put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God. I have\r\ncaused sorrow already\xe2\x80\x94I know\xe2\x80\x94I feel it; but I have never deliberately\r\nconsented to it; I have never said, \xe2\x80\x98They shall suffer, that I may have\r\njoy.\xe2\x80\x99 It has never been my will to marry you; if you were to win\r\nconsent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you, you would not\r\nhave my whole soul. If I could wake back again into the time before\r\nyesterday, I would choose to be true to my calmer affections, and live\r\nwithout the joy of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen loosed her hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down the\r\nroom in suppressed rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a miserable thing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove is to a man\xe2\x80\x99s! I could commit crimes for you,\xe2\x80\x94and you can balance\r\nand choose in that way. But you _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ love me; if you had a tithe of\r\nthe feeling for me that I have for you, it would be impossible to you\r\nto think for a moment of sacrificing me. But it weighs nothing with you\r\nthat you are robbing me of _my_ life\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held\r\nthem clasped on her lap. A great terror was upon her, as if she were\r\never and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning, and\r\nthen again stretched forth her hands in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sacrifice you\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sacrifice you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon\r\nas she could speak again; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a good for you, that\r\nI feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward others. We can\xe2\x80\x99t choose\r\nhappiness either for ourselves or for another; we can\xe2\x80\x99t tell where that\r\nwill lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the\r\npresent moment, or whether we will renounce that, for the sake of\r\nobeying the divine voice within us,\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of being true to all\r\nthe motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is hard; it has\r\nslipped away from me again and again; but I have felt that if I let it\r\ngo forever, I should have no light through the darkness of this life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, seating himself by her again, \xe2\x80\x9cis it\r\npossible you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that what happened yesterday has altered the\r\nwhole position of things? What infatuation is it, what obstinate\r\nprepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we\r\nmight have done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very worst\r\nview of what has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our\r\nposition is altered; the right course is no longer what it was before.\r\nWe must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we\r\nhad been married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on\r\nothers would not have been different. It would only have made this\r\ndifference to ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen added bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you might have\r\nacknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain a deep flush came over Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s face, and she was silent. Stephen\r\nthought again that he was beginning to prevail,\xe2\x80\x94he had never yet\r\nbelieved that he should _not_ prevail; there are possibilities which\r\nour minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward her,\r\nand putting his arm round her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _are_ mine now,\xe2\x80\x94the world believes\r\nit; duty must spring out of that now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on\r\nus will submit,\xe2\x80\x94they will see that there was a force which declared\r\nagainst their claims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was\r\nclose to hers, and she started up, pale again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice almost of agony; \xe2\x80\x9cStephen,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t urge me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t argue any longer,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nis wise; but my heart will not let me do it. I see,\xe2\x80\x94I feel their\r\ntrouble now; it is as if it were branded on my mind. _I_ have suffered,\r\nand had no one to pity me; and now I have made others suffer. It would\r\nnever leave me; it would embitter your love to me. I _do_ care for\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x94in a different way; I remember all we said to each other; I know\r\nhow he thought of me as the one promise of his life. He was given to me\r\nthat I might make his lot less hard; and I have forsaken him. And\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x94she has been deceived; she who trusted me more than any one. I\r\ncannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung\r\nout of their misery. It is not the force that ought to rule us,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nthat we feel for each other; it would rend me away from all that my\r\npast life has made dear and holy to me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t set out on a fresh\r\nlife, and forget that; I must go back to it, and cling to it, else I\r\nshall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen, rising too and grasping her arm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nrave. How can you go back without marrying me? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will\r\nbe said, dearest. You see nothing as it really is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do. But they will believe me. I will confess everything. Lucy\r\nwill believe me\xe2\x80\x94she will forgive you, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94oh, _some_ good will come\r\nby clinging to the right. Dear, dear Stephen, let me go!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t drag me\r\ninto deeper remorse. My whole soul has never consented; it does not\r\nconsent now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStephen let go her arm, and sank back on his chair, half-stunned by\r\ndespairing rage. He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while\r\nher eyes were turned toward him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden\r\nchange. At last he said, still without looking at her,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, then,\xe2\x80\x94leave me; don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me any longer,\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his.\r\nBut he shrank from it as if it had been burning iron, and said again,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that\r\ngloomy averted face, and walked out of the room; it was like an\r\nautomatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention. What came after? A\r\nsense of stairs descended as if in a dream, of flagstones, of a chaise\r\nand horses standing, then a street, and a turning into another street\r\nwhere a stage-coach was standing, taking in passengers, and the darting\r\nthought that that coach would take her away, perhaps toward home. But\r\nshe could ask nothing yet; she only got into the coach.\r\n\r\nHome\xe2\x80\x94where her mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of her\r\nvery cares and trials\xe2\x80\x94was the haven toward which her mind tended; the\r\nsanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she would be rescued from more\r\nfalling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain,\r\nwhich yet, as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts into\r\nactivity. But among her thoughts, what others would say and think of\r\nher conduct was hardly present. Love and deep pity and remorseful\r\nanguish left no room for that.\r\n\r\nThe coach was taking her to York, farther away from home; but she did\r\nnot learn that until she was set down in the old city at midnight. It\r\nwas no matter; she could sleep there, and start home the next day. She\r\nhad her purse in her pocket, with all her money in it,\xe2\x80\x94a bank-note and\r\na sovereign; she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness, after\r\ngoing out to make purchases the day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nDid she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with\r\nher will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice? The great\r\nstruggles of life are not so easy as that; the great problems of life\r\nare not so clear. In the darkness of that night she saw Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nturned toward her in passionate, reproachful misery; she lived through\r\nagain all the tremulous delights of his presence with her that made\r\nexistence an easy floating in a stream of joy, instead of a quiet\r\nresolved endurance and effort. The love she had renounced came back\r\nupon her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening her arms to\r\nreceive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and\r\nvanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGone, forever gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SEVENTH\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL RESCUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nThe Return to the Mill\r\n\r\nBetween four and five o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from\r\nthat on which Stephen and Maggie had left St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, Tom Tulliver was\r\nstanding on the gravel walk outside the old house at Dorlcote Mill. He\r\nwas master there now; he had half fulfilled his father\xe2\x80\x99s dying wish,\r\nand by years of steady self-government and energetic work he had\r\nbrought himself near to the attainment of more than the old\r\nrespectability which had been the proud inheritance of the Dodsons and\r\nTullivers.\r\n\r\nBut Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer\r\nafternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it. His mouth wore its\r\nbitterest expression, his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as\r\nhe drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the\r\nsun, and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, began to walk up\r\nand down the gravel. No news of his sister had been heard since Bob\r\nJakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put an end to all\r\nimprobable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he\r\nhad seen her land from a vessel with Mr Stephen Guest. Would the next\r\nnews be that she was married,\xe2\x80\x94or what? Probably that she was not\r\nmarried; Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could\r\nhappen,\xe2\x80\x94not death, but disgrace.\r\n\r\nAs he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face\r\ntoward the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know\r\nwell, approached the gate, and paused to look at him with a\r\nfast-beating heart. Her brother was the human being of whom she had\r\nbeen most afraid from her childhood upward; afraid with that fear which\r\nsprings in us when we love one who is inexorable, unbending,\r\nunmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and\r\nyet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.\r\n\r\nThat deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was\r\nunswervingly bent on returning to her brother, as the natural refuge\r\nthat had been given her. In her deep humiliation under the retrospect\r\nof her own weakness,\xe2\x80\x94in her anguish at the injury she had\r\ninflicted,\xe2\x80\x94she almost desired to endure the severity of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s reproof,\r\nto submit in patient silence to that harsh, disapproving judgment\r\nagainst which she had so often rebelled; it seemed no more than just to\r\nher now,\xe2\x80\x94who was weaker than she was? She craved that outward help to\r\nher better purpose which would come from complete, submissive\r\nconfession; from being in the presence of those whose looks and words\r\nwould be a reflection of her own conscience.\r\n\r\nMaggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating\r\nheadache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the\r\nprevious day and night. There was an expression of physical pain still\r\nabout her brow and eyes, and her whole appearance, with her dress so\r\nlong unchanged, was worn and distressed. She lifted the latch of the\r\ngate and walked in slowly. Tom did not hear the gate; he was just then\r\nclose upon the roaring dam; but he presently turned, and lifting up his\r\neyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a\r\nconfirmation of his worst conjectures. He paused, trembling and white\r\nwith disgust and indignation.\r\n\r\nMaggie paused too, three yards before him. She felt the hatred in his\r\nface, felt it rushing through her fibres; but she must speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she began faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come back to you,\xe2\x80\x94I am come back\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94for refuge\xe2\x80\x94to tell you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find no home with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with tremulous rage. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave disgraced us all. You have disgraced my father\xe2\x80\x99s name. You have\r\nbeen a curse to your best friends. You have been base, deceitful; no\r\nmotives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you\r\nforever. You don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir mother had come to the door now. She stood paralyzed by the\r\ndouble shock of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with more courage, \xe2\x80\x9cI am perhaps not so guilty as\r\nyou believe me to be. I never meant to give way to my feelings. I\r\nstruggled against them. I was carried too far in the boat to come back\r\non Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe in you any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, gradually passing from the\r\ntremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave been carrying on a clandestine relation with Stephen Guest,\xe2\x80\x94as you\r\ndid before with another. He went to see you at my aunt Moss\xe2\x80\x99s; you\r\nwalked alone with him in the lanes; you must have behaved as no modest\r\ngirl would have done to her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s lover, else that could never have\r\nhappened. The people at Luckreth saw you pass; you passed all the other\r\nplaces; you knew what you were doing. You have been using Philip Wakem\r\nas a screen to deceive Lucy,\xe2\x80\x94the kindest friend you ever had. Go and\r\nsee the return you have made her. She\xe2\x80\x99s ill; unable to speak. My mother\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t go near her, lest she should remind her of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was half stunned,\xe2\x80\x94too heavily pressed upon by her anguish even\r\nto discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccusations, still less to vindicate herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, crushing her hands together under her cloak, in the\r\neffort to speak again, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever I have done, I repent it bitterly. I\r\nwant to make amends. I will endure anything. I want to be kept from\r\ndoing wrong again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _will_ keep you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with cruel bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cNot religion;\r\nnot your natural feelings of gratitude and honour. And he\xe2\x80\x94he would\r\ndeserve to be shot, if it were not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But you are ten times worse than he\r\nis. I loathe your character and your conduct. You struggled with your\r\nfeelings, you say. Yes! _I_ have had feelings to struggle with; but I\r\nconquered them. I have had a harder life than you have had; but I have\r\nfound _my_ comfort in doing my duty. But I will sanction no such\r\ncharacter as yours; the world shall know that _I_ feel the difference\r\nbetween right and wrong. If you are in want, I will provide for you;\r\nlet my mother know. But you shall not come under my roof. It is enough\r\nthat I have to bear the thought of your disgrace; the sight of you is\r\nhateful to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her heart. But the poor\r\nfrightened mother\xe2\x80\x99s love leaped out now, stronger than all dread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart-stricken Maggie! More\r\nhelpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will\r\nnot forsake us.\r\n\r\nTom turned and walked into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Tulliver whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll let you stay and\r\nsleep in my bed. He won\xe2\x80\x99t deny that if I ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a low tone, like a moan. \xe2\x80\x9cI will never go\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait for me outside. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get ready and come with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen his mother appeared with her bonnet on, Tom came out to her in the\r\npassage, and put money into her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy house is yours, mother, always,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will come and let me\r\nknow everything you want; you will come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Tulliver took the money, too frightened to say anything. The\r\nonly thing clear to her was the mother\xe2\x80\x99s instinct that she would go\r\nwith her unhappy child.\r\n\r\nMaggie was waiting outside the gate; she took her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand and\r\nthey walked a little way in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go to Luke\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Luke\r\nwill take me in. He was very good to me when I was a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got no room for us, my dear, now; his wife\xe2\x80\x99s got so many\r\nchildren. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to go, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to one o\xe2\x80\x99 your aunts;\r\nand I hardly durst,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs Tulliver, quite destitute of mental\r\nresources in this extremity.\r\n\r\nMaggie was silent a little while, and then said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to Bob Jakin\xe2\x80\x99s, mother; his wife will have room for us, if\r\nthey have no other lodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they went on their way to St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, to the old house by the\r\nriver-side.\r\n\r\nBob himself was at home, with a heaviness at heart which resisted even\r\nthe new joy and pride of possessing a two-months\xe2\x80\x99-old baby, quite the\r\nliveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman. He\r\nwould perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s appearance with Mr Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if he\r\nhad not witnessed the effect it produced on Tom when he went to report\r\nit; and since then, the circumstances which in any case gave a\r\ndisastrous character to her elopement had passed beyond the more polite\r\ncircles of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and had become matter of common talk, accessible\r\nto the grooms and errand-boys. So that when he opened the door and saw\r\nMaggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness, he had no\r\nquestions to ask except one which he dared only ask himself,\xe2\x80\x94where was\r\nMr Stephen Guest? Bob, for his part, hoped he might be in the warmest\r\ndepartment of an asylum understood to exist in the other world for\r\ngentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there.\r\n\r\nThe lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs Jakin the larger and Mrs Jakin\r\nthe less were commanded to make all things comfortable for \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\r\nMissis and the young Miss\xe2\x80\x9d; alas that she was still \xe2\x80\x9cMiss!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ningenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have\r\ncome about; how Mr Stephen Guest could have gone away from her, or\r\ncould have let her go away from him, when he had the chance of keeping\r\nher with him. But he was silent, and would not allow his wife to ask\r\nhim a question; would not present himself in the room, lest it should\r\nappear like intrusion and a wish to pry; having the same chivalry\r\ntoward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days when he had bought her the\r\nmemorable present of books.\r\n\r\nBut after a day or two Mrs Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a\r\nfew hours to see to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s household matters. Maggie had wished this;\r\nafter the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she\r\nhad no longer any active purpose to fulfil, she was less in need of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s presence; she even desired to be alone with her grief. But she\r\nhad been solitary only a little while in the old sitting-room that\r\nlooked on the river, when there came a tap at the door, and turning\r\nround her sad face as she said \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d she saw Bob enter, with the\r\nbaby in his arms and Mumps at his heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she could smile.\r\n\r\nBob, closing the door behind him, came and stood before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little un, Miss, and I want\xe2\x80\x99d you to look at it,\r\nand take it in your arms, if you\xe2\x80\x99d be so good. For we made free to name\r\nit after you, and it \xe2\x80\x99ud be better for your takin\xe2\x80\x99 a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 notice on\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie could not speak, but she put out her arms to receive the tiny\r\nbaby, while Mumps snuffed at it anxiously, to ascertain that this\r\ntransference was all right. Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart had swelled at this action\r\nand speech of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s; she knew well enough that it was a way he had\r\nchosen to show his sympathy and respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d she said presently, and he sat down in silence,\r\nfinding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion, refusing to say\r\nwhat he wanted it to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBob,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and\r\nholding it anxiously, as if she feared it might slip from her mind and\r\nher fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a favour to ask of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you speak so, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, grasping the skin of Mumps\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck; \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do for you, I should look upon it as a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s earnings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to go to Dr Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s, and ask to speak to him, and tell him\r\nthat I am here, and should be very grateful if he would come to me\r\nwhile my mother is away. She will not come back till evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it in a minute,\xe2\x80\x94it is but a step,\xe2\x80\x94but Dr Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nlies dead; she\xe2\x80\x99s to be buried to-morrow; died the day I come from\r\nMudport. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the more pity she should ha\xe2\x80\x99 died just now, if you\r\nwant him. I hardly like to go a-nigh him yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must let it be,\xe2\x80\x94till after a few days,\r\nperhaps, when you hear that he is going about again. But perhaps he may\r\nbe going out of town\xe2\x80\x94to a distance,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a new sense of\r\ndespondency at this idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob. \xe2\x80\x9c_He\xe2\x80\x99ll_ none go away. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\ngentlefolks as go to cry at waterin\xe2\x80\x99-places when their wives die; he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot summat else to do. He looks fine and sharp after the parish, he\r\ndoes. He christened the little un; an\xe2\x80\x99 he was _at_ me to know what I\r\ndid of a Sunday, as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to church. But I told him I was upo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe travel three parts o\xe2\x80\x99 the Sundays,\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 then I\xe2\x80\x99m so used to bein\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nmy legs, I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit so long on end,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 lors, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\npackman can do wi\xe2\x80\x99 a small \xe2\x80\x99lowance o\xe2\x80\x99 church; it tastes strong,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nI; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no call to lay it on thick.\xe2\x80\x99 Eh, Miss, how good the little\r\nun is wi\xe2\x80\x99 you! It\xe2\x80\x99s like as if it knowed you; it partly does, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound,\xe2\x80\x94like the birds know the mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob\xe2\x80\x99s tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage, and\r\nmight even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it. But\r\nthe subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and\r\ndifficult of approach, that his tongue was likely to run on along the\r\nlevel rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road. He felt this, and\r\nwas silent again for a little while, ruminating much on the possible\r\nforms in which he might put a question. At last he said, in a more\r\ntimid voice than usual,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie was rather startled, but she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Bob, if it is about\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94not about any one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss, it\xe2\x80\x99s this. _Do_ you owe anybody a grudge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not any one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, looking up at him inquiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lors, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, pinching Mumps\xe2\x80\x99s neck harder than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you did, an\xe2\x80\x99 tell me; I\xe2\x80\x99d leather him till I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 the Justice might do what he liked to me arter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, smiling faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a very good friend to\r\nme. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to punish any one, even if they\xe2\x80\x99d done me\r\nwrong; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done wrong myself too often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis view of things was puzzling to Bob, and threw more obscurity than\r\never over what could possibly have happened between Stephen and Maggie.\r\nBut further questions would have been too intrusive, even if he could\r\nhave framed them suitably, and he was obliged to carry baby away again\r\nto an expectant mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappen you\xe2\x80\x99d like Mumps for company, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when he had taken\r\nthe baby again. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s rare company, Mumps is; he knows iverything, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmakes no bother about it. If I tell him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll lie before you an\xe2\x80\x99 watch\r\nyou, as still,\xe2\x80\x94just as he watches my pack. You\xe2\x80\x99d better let me leave\r\nhim a bit; he\xe2\x80\x99ll get fond on you. Lors, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing to hev a dumb\r\nbrute fond on you; it\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to you, an\xe2\x80\x99 make no jaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do leave him, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like to\r\nhave Mumps for a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMumps, lie down there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, pointing to a place in front of\r\nMaggie, \xe2\x80\x9cand niver do you stir till you\xe2\x80\x99re spoke to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMumps lay down at once, and made no sign of restlessness when his\r\nmaster left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nSt Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s Passes Judgment\r\n\r\nIt was soon known throughout St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s that Miss Tulliver was come back;\r\nshe had not, then, eloped in order to be married to Mr Stephen\r\nGuest,\xe2\x80\x94at all events, Mr Stephen Guest had not married her; which came\r\nto the same thing, so far as her culpability was concerned. We judge\r\nothers according to results; how else?\xe2\x80\x94not knowing the process by which\r\nresults are arrived at. If Miss Tulliver, after a few months of\r\nwell-chosen travel, had returned as Mrs Stephen Guest, with a\r\npost-marital _trousseau_, and all the advantages possessed even by the\r\nmost unwelcome wife of an only son, public opinion, which at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nas else where, always knew what to think, would have judged in strict\r\nconsistency with those results. Public opinion, in these cases, is\r\nalways of the feminine gender,\xe2\x80\x94not the world, but the world\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and\r\nshe would have seen that two handsome young people\xe2\x80\x94the gentleman of\r\nquite the first family in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94having found themselves in a false\r\nposition, had been led into a course which, to say the least of it, was\r\nhighly injudicious, and productive of sad pain and disappointment,\r\nespecially to that sweet young thing, Miss Deane. Mr Stephen Guest had\r\ncertainly not behaved well; but then, young men were liable to those\r\nsudden infatuated attachments; and bad as it might seem in Mrs Stephen\r\nGuest to admit the faintest advances from her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s lover (indeed it\r\n_had_ been said that she was actually engaged to young Wakem,\xe2\x80\x94old Wakem\r\nhimself had mentioned it), still, she was very young,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand a deformed\r\nyoung man, you know!\xe2\x80\x94and young Guest so very fascinating; and, they\r\nsay, he positively worships her (to be sure, that can\xe2\x80\x99t last!), and he\r\nran away with her in the boat quite against her will, and what could\r\nshe do? She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back then; no one would have spoken to her;\r\nand how very well that maize-coloured satinette becomes her complexion!\r\nIt seems as if the folds in front were quite come in; several of her\r\ndresses are made so,\xe2\x80\x94they say he thinks nothing too handsome to buy for\r\nher. Poor Miss Deane! She is very pitiable; but then there was no\r\npositive engagement; and the air at the coast will do her good. After\r\nall, if young Guest felt no more for her than _that_ it was better for\r\nher not to marry him. What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss\r\nTulliver,\xe2\x80\x94quite romantic? Why, young Guest will put up for the borough\r\nat the next election. Nothing like commerce nowadays! That young Wakem\r\nnearly went out of his mind; he always _was_ rather queer; but he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone abroad again to be out of the way,\xe2\x80\x94quite the best thing for a\r\ndeformed young man. Miss Unit declares she will never visit Mr and Mrs\r\nStephen Guest,\xe2\x80\x94such nonsense! pretending to be better than other\r\npeople. Society couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be carried on if we inquired into private\r\nconduct in that way,\xe2\x80\x94and Christianity tells us to think no evil,\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\nbelief is, that Miss Unit had no cards sent her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the results, we know, were not of a kind to warrant this\r\nextenuation of the past. Maggie had returned without a _trousseau_,\r\nwithout a husband,\xe2\x80\x94in that degraded and outcast condition to which\r\nerror is well known to lead; and the world\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with that fine\r\ninstinct which is given her for the preservation of Society, saw at\r\nonce that Miss Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s conduct had been of the most aggravated kind.\r\nCould anything be more detestable? A girl so much indebted to her\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94whose mother as well as herself had received so much kindness\r\nfrom the Deanes\xe2\x80\x94to lay the design of winning a young man\xe2\x80\x99s affections\r\naway from her own cousin, who had behaved like a sister to her! Winning\r\nhis affections? That was not the phrase for such a girl as Miss\r\nTulliver; it would have been more correct to say that she had been\r\nactuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion. There was\r\nalways something questionable about her. That connection with young\r\nWakem, which, they said, had been carried on for years, looked very\r\nill,\xe2\x80\x94disgusting, in fact! But with a girl of that disposition! To the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\n_physique_ that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm. As for\r\npoor Mr Stephen Guest, he was rather pitiable than otherwise; a young\r\nman of five-and-twenty is not to be too severely judged in these\r\ncases,\xe2\x80\x94he is really very much at the mercy of a designing, bold girl.\r\nAnd it was clear that he had given way in spite of himself: he had\r\nshaken her off as soon as he could; indeed, their having parted so soon\r\nlooked very black indeed\xe2\x80\x94_for her_. To be sure, he had written a\r\nletter, laying all the blame on himself, and telling the story in a\r\nromantic fashion so as to try and make her appear quite innocent; of\r\ncourse he would do that! But the refined instinct of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwas not to be deceived; providentially!\xe2\x80\x94else what would become of\r\nSociety? Why, her own brother had turned her from his door; he had seen\r\nenough, you might be sure, before he would do that. A truly respectable\r\nyoung man, Mr Tom Tulliver; quite likely to rise in the world! His\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him. It was to be hoped\r\nthat she would go out of the neighbourhood,\xe2\x80\x94to America, or anywhere,\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nas to purify the air of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s from the stain of her presence,\r\nextremely dangerous to daughters there! No good could happen to her; it\r\nwas only to be hoped she would repent, and that God would have mercy on\r\nher: He had not the care of society on His hands, as the world\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nIt required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of\r\nthese inspirations; indeed, it was a whole week before Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\ncame, telling his father the facts, and adding that he was gone across\r\nto Holland,\xe2\x80\x94had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for money,\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nincapable of any resolution at present.\r\n\r\nMaggie, all this while, was too entirely filled with a more agonizing\r\nanxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her\r\nconduct by the world of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s; anxiety about Stephen, Lucy, Philip,\r\nbeat on her poor heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of mingled\r\nlove, remorse, and pity. If she had thought of rejection and injustice\r\nat all, it would have seemed to her that they had done their worst;\r\nthat she could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable since the\r\nwords she had heard from her brother\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Across all her anxiety for\r\nthe loved and the injured, those words shot again and again, like a\r\nhorrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even into a\r\nheaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering happiness never\r\nglimmered in her mind for a moment; it seemed as if every sensitive\r\nfibre in her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate\r\nagain to another influence. Life stretched before her as one act of\r\npenitence; and all she craved, as she dwelt on her future lot, was\r\nsomething to guarantee her from more falling; her own weakness haunted\r\nher like a vision of hideous possibilities, that made no peace\r\nconceivable except such as lay in the sense of a sure refuge.\r\n\r\nBut she was not without practical intentions; the love of independence\r\nwas too strong an inheritance and a habit for her not to remember that\r\nshe must get her bread; and when other projects looked vague, she fell\r\nback on that of returning to her plain sewing, and so getting enough to\r\npay for her lodging at Bob\xe2\x80\x99s. She meant to persuade her mother to\r\nreturn to the Mill by and by, and live with Tom again; and somehow or\r\nother she would maintain herself at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Dr Kenn would perhaps\r\nhelp her and advise her. She remembered his parting words at the\r\nbazaar. She remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had\r\nsprung in her when he was talking with her, and she waited with\r\nyearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to\r\nhim. Her mother called every day at Mr Deane\xe2\x80\x99s to learn how Lucy was;\r\nthe report was always sad,\xe2\x80\x94nothing had yet roused her from the feeble\r\npassivity which had come on with the first shock. But of Philip, Mrs\r\nTulliver had learned nothing; naturally, no one whom she met would\r\nspeak to her about what related to her daughter. But at last she\r\nsummoned courage to go and see sister Glegg, who of course would know\r\neverything, and had been even to see Tom at the Mill in Mrs Tulliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, though he had said nothing of what had passed on the occasion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her mother was gone, Maggie put on her bonnet. She had\r\nresolved on walking to the Rectory and asking to see Dr Kenn; he was in\r\ndeep grief, but the grief of another does not jar upon us in such\r\ncircumstances. It was the first time she had been beyond the door since\r\nher return; nevertheless her mind was so bent on the purpose of her\r\nwalk, that the unpleasantness of meeting people on the way, and being\r\nstared at, did not occur to her. But she had no sooner passed beyond\r\nthe narrower streets which she had to thread from Bob\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling, than\r\nshe became aware of unusual glances cast at her; and this consciousness\r\nmade her hurry along nervously, afraid to look to right or left.\r\nPresently, however, she came full on Mrs and Miss Turnbull, old\r\nacquaintances of her family; they both looked at her strangely, and\r\nturned a little aside without speaking. All hard looks were pain to\r\nMaggie, but her self-reproach was too strong for resentment. No wonder\r\nthey will not speak to me, she thought; they are very fond of Lucy. But\r\nnow she knew that she was about to pass a group of gentlemen, who were\r\nstanding at the door of the billiard-rooms, and she could not help\r\nseeing young Torry step out a little with his glass at his eye, and bow\r\nto her with that air of _nonchalance_ which he might have bestowed on a\r\nfriendly barmaid.\r\n\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting, even in\r\nthe midst of her sorrow; and for the first time the thought took strong\r\nhold of her that she would have other obloquy cast on her besides that\r\nwhich was felt to be due to her breach of faith toward Lucy. But she\r\nwas at the Rectory now; there, perhaps, she would find something else\r\nthan retribution. Retribution may come from any voice; the hardest,\r\ncruelest, most imbruted urchin at the street-corner can inflict it;\r\nsurely help and pity are rarer things, more needful for the righteous\r\nto bestow.\r\n\r\nShe was shown up at once, after being announced, into Dr Kenn\xe2\x80\x99s study,\r\nwhere he sat amongst piled-up books, for which he had little appetite,\r\nleaning his cheek against the head of his youngest child, a girl of\r\nthree. The child was sent away with the servant, and when the door was\r\nclosed, Dr Kenn said, placing a chair for Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to see you, Miss Tulliver; you have anticipated me; I am\r\nglad you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at\r\nthe bazaar, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d But her eyes\r\nfilled fast with tears as she said it, and all the pent-up excitement\r\nof her humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Kenn said, with quiet kindness in his\r\ngrave, firm voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of me as one to whom a long experience has\r\nbeen granted, which may enable him to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn rather broken sentences, and with some effort at first, but soon\r\nwith the greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the\r\nconfidence, Maggie told the brief story of a struggle that must be the\r\nbeginning of a long sorrow. Only the day before, Dr Kenn had been made\r\nacquainted with the contents of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and he had believed\r\nthem at once, without the confirmation of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s statement. That\r\ninvoluntary plaint of hers, \xe2\x80\x9c_Oh, I must go_,\xe2\x80\x9d had remained with him as\r\nthe sign that she was undergoing some inward conflict.\r\n\r\nMaggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to\r\nher mother and brother, which made her cling to all the memories of the\r\npast. When she had ended, Dr Kenn was silent for some minutes; there\r\nwas a difficulty on his mind. He rose, and walked up and down the\r\nhearth with his hands behind him. At last he seated himself again, and\r\nsaid, looking at Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour prompting to go to your nearest friends,\xe2\x80\x94to remain where all the\r\nties of your life have been formed,\xe2\x80\x94is a true prompting, to which the\r\nChurch in its original constitution and discipline responds, opening\r\nits arms to the penitent, watching over its children to the last; never\r\nabandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate. And the Church\r\nought to represent the feeling of the community, so that every parish\r\nshould be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood under a\r\nspiritual father. But the ideas of discipline and Christian fraternity\r\nare entirely relaxed,\xe2\x80\x94they can hardly be said to exist in the public\r\nmind; they hardly survive except in the partial, contradictory form\r\nthey have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics; and if I were\r\nnot supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately recover\r\nthe full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human\r\nneeds, I should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship\r\nand sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock. At present\r\neverything seems tending toward the relaxation of ties,\xe2\x80\x94toward the\r\nsubstitution of wayward choice for the adherence to obligation, which\r\nhas its roots in the past. Your conscience and your heart have given\r\nyou true light on this point, Miss Tulliver; and I have said all this\r\nthat you may know what my wish about you\xe2\x80\x94what my advice to you\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nbe, if they sprang from my own feeling and opinion unmodified by\r\ncounteracting circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr Kenn paused a little while. There was an entire absence of effusive\r\nbenevolence in his manner; there was something almost cold in the\r\ngravity of his look and voice. If Maggie had not known that his\r\nbenevolence was persevering in proportion to its reserve, she might\r\nhave been chilled and frightened. As it was, she listened expectantly,\r\nquite sure that there would be some effective help in his words. He\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour inexperience of the world, Miss Tulliver, prevents you from\r\nanticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be\r\nformed concerning your conduct,\xe2\x80\x94conceptions which will have a baneful\r\neffect, even in spite of known evidence to disprove them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do,\xe2\x80\x94I begin to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, unable to repress this\r\nutterance of her recent pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I shall be insulted. I shall be\r\nthought worse than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou perhaps do not yet know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr Kenn, with a touch of more\r\npersonal pity, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one\r\nwho has known anything of you, that you chose the steep and difficult\r\npath of a return to the right, at the moment when that return was most\r\nof all difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Maggie, with a flush and tremor that no\r\npresence could have hindered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is gone abroad; he has written of all that passed to his father. He\r\nhas vindicated you to the utmost; and I hope the communication of that\r\nletter to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr Kenn waited for her to get calm again before he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat letter, as I said, ought to suffice to prevent false impressions\r\nconcerning you. But I am bound to tell you, Miss Tulliver, that not\r\nonly the experience of my whole life, but my observation within the\r\nlast three days, makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which\r\nwill save you from the painful effect of false imputations. The persons\r\nwho are the most incapable of a conscientious struggle such as yours\r\nare precisely those who will be likely to shrink from you, because they\r\nwill not believe in your struggle. I fear your life here will be\r\nattended not only with much pain, but with many obstructions. For this\r\nreason\xe2\x80\x94and for this only\xe2\x80\x94I ask you to consider whether it will not\r\nperhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance, according\r\nto your former intention. I will exert myself at once to obtain one for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I could but stop here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no heart to begin\r\na strange life again. I should have no stay. I should feel like a\r\nlonely wanderer, cut off from the past. I have written to the lady who\r\noffered me a situation to excuse myself. If I remained here, I could\r\nperhaps atone in some way to Lucy\xe2\x80\x94to others; I could convince them that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. And,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with some of the old proud fire flashing\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not go away because people say false things of me. They\r\nshall learn to retract them. If I must go away at last, because\xe2\x80\x94because\r\nothers wish it, I will not go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr Kenn, after some consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cif you determine on\r\nthat, Miss Tulliver, you may rely on all the influence my position\r\ngives me. I am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of\r\nmy office as a parish priest. I will add, that personally I have a deep\r\ninterest in your peace of mind and welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get my\r\nbread and be independent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not want much. I can\r\ngo on lodging where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must think over the subject maturely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr Kenn, \xe2\x80\x9cand in a few\r\ndays I shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling. I shall\r\ncome to see you; I shall bear you constantly in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie had left him, Dr Kenn stood ruminating with his hands\r\nbehind him, and his eyes fixed on the carpet, under a painful sense of\r\ndoubt and difficulty. The tone of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which he had read,\r\nand the actual relations of all the persons concerned, forced upon him\r\npowerfully the idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie\r\nas the least evil; and the impossibility of their proximity in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non any other supposition, until after years of separation, threw an\r\ninsurmountable prospective difficulty over Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s stay there. On the\r\nother hand, he entered with all the comprehension of a man who had\r\nknown spiritual conflict, and lived through years of devoted service to\r\nhis fellow-men, into that state of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart and conscience which\r\nmade the consent to the marriage a desecration to her; her conscience\r\nmust not be tampered with; the principle on which she had acted was a\r\nsafer guide than any balancing of consequences. His experience told him\r\nthat intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be lightly\r\nincurred; the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the\r\nformer relations with Lucy and Philip, or of counselling submission to\r\nthis irruption of a new feeling, was hidden in a darkness all the more\r\nimpenetrable because each immediate step was clogged with evil.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is\r\nclear to no man who is capable of apprehending it; the question whether\r\nthe moment has come in which a man has fallen below the possibility of\r\na renunciation that will carry any efficacy, and must accept the sway\r\nof a passion against which he had struggled as a trespass, is one for\r\nwhich we have no master-key that will fit all cases. The casuists have\r\nbecome a byword of reproach; but their perverted spirit of minute\r\ndiscrimination was the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are\r\ntoo often fatally sealed,\xe2\x80\x94the truth, that moral judgments must remain\r\nfalse and hollow, unless they are checked and enlightened by a\r\nperpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the\r\nindividual lot.\r\n\r\nAll people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the\r\nmen of maxims; because such people early discern that the mysterious\r\ncomplexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims, and that to\r\nlace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine\r\npromptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and\r\nsympathy. And the man of maxims is the popular representative of the\r\nminds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by general rules,\r\nthinking that these will lead them to justice by a ready-made patent\r\nmethod, without the trouble of exerting patience, discrimination,\r\nimpartiality,\xe2\x80\x94without any care to assure themselves whether they have\r\nthe insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of temptation, or\r\nfrom a life vivid and intense enough to have created a wide\r\nfellow-feeling with all that is human.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nShowing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie was at home again, her mother brought her news of an\r\nunexpected line of conduct in aunt Glegg. As long as Maggie had not\r\nbeen heard of, Mrs Glegg had half closed her shutters and drawn down\r\nher blinds. She felt assured that Maggie was drowned; that was far more\r\nprobable than that her niece and legatee should have done anything to\r\nwound the family honour in the tenderest point. When at last she\r\nlearned from Tom that Maggie had come home, and gathered from him what\r\nwas her explanation of her absence, she burst forth in severe reproof\r\nof Tom for admitting the worst of his sister until he was compelled. If\r\nyou were not to stand by your \xe2\x80\x9ckin\xe2\x80\x9d as long as there was a shred of\r\nhonour attributable to them, pray what were you to stand by? Lightly to\r\nadmit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to alter\r\nyour will, had never been the way of the Dodsons; and though Mrs Glegg\r\nhad always augured ill of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s future at a time when other people\r\nwere perhaps less clear-sighted, yet fair play was a jewel, and it was\r\nnot for her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame, and\r\nto cast her out from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world,\r\nuntil she had become unequivocally a family disgrace. The circumstances\r\nwere unprecedented in Mrs Glegg\xe2\x80\x99s experience; nothing of that kind had\r\nhappened among the Dodsons before; but it was a case in which her\r\nhereditary rectitude and personal strength of character found a common\r\nchannel along with her fundamental ideas of clanship, as they did in\r\nher lifelong regard to equity in money matters. She quarrelled with Mr\r\nGlegg, whose kindness, flowing entirely into compassion for Lucy, made\r\nhim as hard in his judgment of Maggie as Mr Deane himself was; and\r\nfuming against her sister Tulliver because she did not at once come to\r\nher for advice and help, shut herself up in her own room with Baxter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaints\xe2\x80\x99 Rest\xe2\x80\x9d from morning till night, denying herself to all\r\nvisitors, till Mr Glegg brought from Mr Deane the news of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. Then Mrs Glegg felt that she had adequate fighting-ground; then\r\nshe laid aside Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers. While Mrs\r\nPullet could do nothing but shake her head and cry, and wish that\r\ncousin Abbot had died, or any number of funerals had happened rather\r\nthan this, which had never happened before, so that there was no\r\nknowing how to act, and Mrs Pullet could never enter St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s again,\r\nbecause \xe2\x80\x9cacquaintances\xe2\x80\x9d knew of it all, Mrs Glegg only hoped that Mrs\r\nWooll, or any one else, would come to her with their false tales about\r\nher own niece, and she would know what to say to that ill-advised\r\nperson!\r\n\r\nAgain she had a scene of remonstrance with Tom, all the more severe in\r\nproportion to the greater strength of her present position. But Tom,\r\nlike other immovable things, seemed only the more rigidly fixed under\r\nthat attempt to shake him. Poor Tom! he judged by what he had been able\r\nto see; and the judgment was painful enough to himself. He thought he\r\nhad the demonstration of facts observed through years by his own eyes,\r\nwhich gave no warning of their imperfection, that Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s nature was\r\nutterly untrustworthy, and too strongly marked with evil tendencies to\r\nbe safely treated with leniency. He would act on that demonstration at\r\nany cost; but the thought of it made his days bitter to him. Tom, like\r\nevery one of us, was imprisoned within the limits of his own nature,\r\nand his education had simply glided over him, leaving a slight deposit\r\nof polish; if you are inclined to be severe on his severity, remember\r\nthat the responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider\r\nvision. There had arisen in Tom a repulsion toward Maggie that derived\r\nits very intensity from their early childish love in the time when they\r\nhad clasped tiny fingers together, and their later sense of nearness in\r\na common duty and a common sorrow; the sight of her, as he had told\r\nher, was hateful to him. In this branch of the Dodson family aunt Glegg\r\nfound a stronger nature than her own; a nature in which family feeling\r\nhad lost the character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of\r\npersonal pride.\r\n\r\nMrs Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished,\xe2\x80\x94she was not a woman\r\nto deny that; she knew what conduct was,\xe2\x80\x94but punished in proportion to\r\nthe misdeeds proved against her, not to those which were cast upon her\r\nby people outside her own family who might wish to show that their own\r\nkin were better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mrs\r\nTulliver, when she came back to Maggie, \xe2\x80\x9cas I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to her before;\r\nshe said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for her to come to me first. But she spoke like a\r\nsister, too; _having_ she allays was, and hard to please,\xe2\x80\x94oh dear!\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you yet, my\r\nchild. For she says, for all she\xe2\x80\x99s been so set again\xe2\x80\x99 having one extry\r\nin the house, and making extry spoons and things, and putting her about\r\nin her ways, you shall have a shelter in her house, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to her\r\ndutiful, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll uphold you against folks as say harm of you when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve no call. And I told her I thought you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see\r\nanybody but me, you were so beat down with trouble; but she said, \xe2\x80\x98_I_\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t throw ill words at her; there\xe2\x80\x99s them out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 family \xe2\x80\x99ull be\r\nready enough to do that. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her good advice; an\xe2\x80\x99 she must be\r\nhumble.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful o\xe2\x80\x99 Jane; for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she used to throw\r\neverything I did wrong at me,\xe2\x80\x94if it was the raisin-wine as turned out\r\nbad, or the pies too hot, or whativer it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Maggie, shrinking from the thought of all the\r\ncontact her bruised mind would have to bear, \xe2\x80\x9ctell her I\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\ngrateful; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to see her as soon as I can; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any one\r\njust yet, except Dr Kenn. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to him,\xe2\x80\x94he will advise me, and help\r\nme to get some occupation. I can\xe2\x80\x99t live with any one, or be dependent\r\non them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread. But did you hear\r\nnothing of Philip\xe2\x80\x94Philip Wakem? Have you never seen any one that has\r\nmentioned him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s, and I saw your uncle, and he\r\nsays they got her to listen to the letter, and she took notice o\xe2\x80\x99 Miss\r\nGuest, and asked questions, and the doctor thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s on the turn to\r\nbe better. What a world this is,\xe2\x80\x94what trouble, oh dear! The law was the\r\nfirst beginning, and it\xe2\x80\x99s gone from bad to worse, all of a sudden, just\r\nwhen the luck seemed on the turn.\xe2\x80\x9d This was the first lamentation that\r\nMrs Tulliver had let slip to Maggie, but old habit had been revived by\r\nthe interview with sister Glegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor, poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie burst out, cut to the heart with pity\r\nand compunction, and throwing her arms round her mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck; \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nalways naughty and troublesome to you. And now you might have been\r\nhappy if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Tulliver, leaning toward the warm young cheek;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 my children,\xe2\x80\x94I shall never have no more; and if they\r\nbring me bad luck, I must be fond on it. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else much to\r\nbe fond on, for my furnitur\xe2\x80\x99 went long ago. And you\xe2\x80\x99d got to be very\r\ngood once; I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how it\xe2\x80\x99s turned out the wrong way so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of\r\nPhilip; anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble, and she\r\nsummoned courage at last to inquire about him of Dr Kenn, on his next\r\nvisit to her. He did not even know if Philip was at home. The elder\r\nWakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance; the\r\ndisappointment in this young Jetsome, to whom, apparently, he was a\r\ngood deal attached, had been followed close by the catastrophe to his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s hopes after he had done violence to his own strong feeling by\r\nconceding to them, and had incautiously mentioned this concession in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s; and he was almost fierce in his brusqueness when any one asked\r\nhim a question about his son.\r\n\r\nBut Philip could hardly have been ill, or it would have been known\r\nthrough the calling in of the medical man; it was probable that he was\r\ngone out of the town for a little while. Maggie sickened under this\r\nsuspense, and her imagination began to live more and more persistently\r\nin what Philip was enduring. What did he believe about her?\r\n\r\nAt last Bob brought her a letter, without a postmark, directed in a\r\nhand which she knew familiarly in the letters of her own name,\xe2\x80\x94a hand\r\nin which her name had been written long ago, in a pocket Shakespeare\r\nwhich she possessed. Her mother was in the room, and Maggie, in violent\r\nagitation, hurried upstairs that she might read the letter in solitude.\r\nShe read it with a throbbing brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x94I believe in you; I know you never meant to deceive me; I know\r\nyou tried to keep faith to me and to all. I believed this before I had\r\nany other evidence of it than your own nature. The night after I last\r\nparted from you I suffered torments. I had seen what convinced me that\r\nyou were not free; that there was another whose presence had a power\r\nover you which mine never possessed; but through all the\r\nsuggestions\xe2\x80\x94almost murderous suggestions\xe2\x80\x94of rage and jealousy, my mind\r\nmade its way to believe in your truthfulness. I was sure that you meant\r\nto cleave to me, as you had said; that you had rejected him; that you\r\nstruggled to renounce him, for Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s sake and for mine. But I could\r\nsee no issue that was not fatal for _you;_ and that dread shut out the\r\nvery thought of resignation. I foresaw that he would not relinquish\r\nyou, and I believed then, as I believe now, that the strong attraction\r\nwhich drew you together proceeded only from one side of your\r\ncharacters, and belonged to that partial, divided action of our nature\r\nwhich makes half the tragedy of the human lot. I have felt the\r\nvibration of chords in your nature that I have continually felt the\r\nwant of in his. But perhaps I am wrong; perhaps I feel about you as the\r\nartist does about the scene over which his soul has brooded with love;\r\nhe would tremble to see it confided to other hands; he would never\r\nbelieve that it could bear for another all the meaning and the beauty\r\nit bears for him.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI dared not trust myself to see you that morning; I was filled\r\n    with selfish passion; I was shattered by a night of conscious\r\n    delirium. I told you long ago that I had never been resigned even\r\n    to the mediocrity of my powers; how could I be resigned to the loss\r\n    of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the\r\n    promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to\r\n    the foregoing pain,\xe2\x80\x94the promise of another self that would lift my\r\n    aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever-springing,\r\n    ever-satisfied want?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came\r\n    before the next. It was no surprise to me. I was certain that he\r\n    had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him, and I waited\r\n    with equal certainty to hear of your marriage. I measured your love\r\n    and his by my own. But I was wrong, Maggie. There is something\r\n    stronger in you than your love for him.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI will not tell you what I went through in that interval. But even\r\n    in its utmost agony\xe2\x80\x94even in those terrible throes that love must\r\n    suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desire\xe2\x80\x94my love for\r\n    you sufficed to withhold me from suicide, without the aid of any\r\n    other motive. In the midst of my egoism, I yet could not bear to\r\n    come like a death-shadow across the feast of your joy. I could not\r\n    bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need\r\n    me; it was part of the faith I had vowed to you,\xe2\x80\x94to wait and\r\n    endure. Maggie, that is a proof of what I write now to assure you\r\n    of,\xe2\x80\x94that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been too\r\n    heavy a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered in\r\n    loving you. I want you to put aside all grief because of the grief\r\n    you have caused me. I was nurtured in the sense of privation; I\r\n    never expected happiness; and in knowing you, in loving you, I have\r\n    had, and still have, what reconciles me to life. You have been to\r\n    my affections what light, what colour is to my eyes, what music is\r\n    to the inward ear, you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid\r\n    consciousness. The new life I have found in caring for your joy and\r\n    sorrow more than for what is directly my own, has transformed the\r\n    spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is\r\n    the birth of strong sympathy. I think nothing but such complete and\r\n    intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which\r\n    grows and grows by appropriating the life of others; for before, I\r\n    was always dragged back from it by ever-present painful\r\n    self-consciousness. I even think sometimes that this gift of\r\n    transferred life which has come to me in loving you, may be a new\r\n    power to me.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThen, dear one, in spite of all, you have been the blessing of my\r\n    life. Let no self-reproach weigh on you because of me. It is I who\r\n    should rather reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon\r\n    you, and hurried you into words that you have felt as fetters. You\r\n    meant to be true to those words; you _have_ been true. I can\r\n    measure your sacrifice by what I have known in only one half-hour\r\n    of your presence with me, when I dreamed that you might love me\r\n    best. But, Maggie, I have no just claim on you for more than\r\n    affectionate remembrance.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cFor some time I have shrunk from writing to you, because I have\r\n    shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before\r\n    you, and so repeating my original error. But you will not\r\n    misconstrue me. I know that we must keep apart for a long while;\r\n    cruel tongues would force us apart, if nothing else did. But I\r\n    shall not go away. The place where you are is the one where my mind\r\n    must live, wherever I might travel. And remember that I am\r\n    unchangeably yours,\xe2\x80\x94yours not with selfish wishes, but with a\r\n    devotion that excludes such wishes.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cGod comfort you, my loving, large-souled Maggie. If every one else\r\n    has misconceived you, remember that you have never been doubted by\r\n    him whose heart recognised you ten years ago.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo not believe any one who says I am ill, because I am not seen\r\n    out of doors. I have only had nervous headaches,\xe2\x80\x94no worse than I\r\n    have sometimes had them before. But the overpowering heat inclines\r\n    me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime. I am strong enough to\r\n    obey any word which shall tell me that I can serve you by word or\r\n    deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours to the last,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Philip Wakem_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing, with that letter pressed under her,\r\nher feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry,\r\nalways in the same words,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, is there any happiness in love that could make me forget\r\n_their_ pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nMaggie and Lucy\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week Dr Kenn had made up his mind that there was only\r\none way in which he could secure to Maggie a suitable living at St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s. Even with his twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 experience as a parish priest, he\r\nwas aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in\r\nthe face of evidence. Hitherto he had been rather more adored and\r\nappealed to than was quite agreeable to him; but now, in attempting to\r\nopen the ears of women to reason, and their consciences to justice, on\r\nbehalf of Maggie Tulliver, he suddenly found himself as powerless as he\r\nwas aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape\r\nof bonnets. Dr Kenn could not be contradicted; he was listened to in\r\nsilence; but when he left the room, a comparison of opinions among his\r\nhearers yielded much the same result as before. Miss Tulliver had\r\nundeniably acted in a blamable manner, even Dr Kenn did not deny that;\r\nhow, then, could he think so lightly of her as to put that favourable\r\ninterpretation on everything she had done? Even on the supposition that\r\nrequired the utmost stretch of belief,\xe2\x80\x94namely, that none of the things\r\nsaid about Miss Tulliver were true,\xe2\x80\x94still, since they _had_ been said\r\nabout her, they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be\r\nshrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own\r\nreputation\xe2\x80\x94and of Society. To have taken Maggie by the hand and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not believe unproved evil of you; my lips shall not utter it;\r\nmy ears shall be closed against it; I, too, am an erring mortal, liable\r\nto stumble, apt to come short of my most earnest efforts; your lot has\r\nbeen harder than mine, your temptation greater; let us help each other\r\nto stand and walk without more falling,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to have done this would have\r\ndemanded courage, deep pity, self-knowledge, generous trust; would have\r\ndemanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evil-speaking, that felt no\r\nself-exaltation in condemning, that cheated itself with no large words\r\ninto the belief that life can have any moral end, any high religion,\r\nwhich excludes the striving after perfect truth, justice, and love\r\ntoward the individual men and women who come across our own path. The\r\nladies of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s were not beguiled by any wide speculative\r\nconceptions; but they had their favourite abstraction, called Society,\r\nwhich served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what\r\nsatisfied their own egoism,\xe2\x80\x94thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie\r\nTulliver, and turning their backs upon her. It was naturally\r\ndisappointing to Dr Kenn, after two years of superfluous incense from\r\nhis feminine parishioners, to find them suddenly maintaining their\r\nviews in opposition to his; but then they maintained them in opposition\r\nto a higher Authority, which they had venerated longer. That Authority\r\nhad furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where\r\ntheir social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as\r\nto the starting-point. The answer had not turned on the ultimate good\r\nof Society, but on \xe2\x80\x9ca certain man\xe2\x80\x9d who was found in trouble by the\r\nwayside.\r\n\r\nNot that St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and\r\nconscience; probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in\r\nit as any other small trading town of that day. But until every good\r\nman is brave, we must expect to find many good women timid,\xe2\x80\x94too timid\r\neven to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings, when\r\nthese would place them in a minority. And the men at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s were not\r\nall brave, by any means; some of them were even fond of scandal, and to\r\nan extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate\r\ncharacter, if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes, and by\r\nan occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women. It\r\nwas the general feeling of the masculine mind at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s that women\r\nwere not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other.\r\n\r\nAnd thus every direction in which Dr Kenn had turned, in the hope of\r\nprocuring some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie, proved\r\na disappointment to him. Mrs James Torry could not think of taking\r\nMaggie as a nursery governess, even temporarily,\xe2\x80\x94a young woman about\r\nwhom \xe2\x80\x9csuch things had been said,\xe2\x80\x9d and about whom \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen joked\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nMiss Kirke, who had a spinal complaint, and wanted a reader and\r\ncompanion, felt quite sure that Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s mind must be of a quality with\r\nwhich she, for her part, could not risk _any_ contact. Why did not Miss\r\nTulliver accept the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg? It did not\r\nbecome a girl like her to refuse it. Or else, why did she not go out of\r\nthe neighbourhood, and get a situation where she was not known? (It was\r\nnot, apparently, of so much importance that she should carry her\r\ndangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s.) She\r\nmust be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish where she\r\nwas so much stared at and whispered about.\r\n\r\nDr Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of this\r\nopposition, as every firm man would have done, to contract a certain\r\nstrength of determination over and above what would have been called\r\nforth by the end in view. He himself wanted a daily governess for his\r\nyounger children; and though he had hesitated in the first instance to\r\noffer this position to Maggie, the resolution to protest with the\r\nutmost force of his personal and priestly character against her being\r\ncrushed and driven away by slander, was now decisive. Maggie gratefully\r\naccepted an employment that gave her duties as well as a support; her\r\ndays would be filled now, and solitary evenings would be a welcome\r\nrest. She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying\r\nwith her, and Mrs Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill.\r\n\r\nBut now it began to be discovered that Dr Kenn, exemplary as he had\r\nhitherto appeared, had his crotchets, possibly his weaknesses. The\r\nmasculine mind of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s smiled pleasantly, and did not wonder that\r\nKenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily, or that he was inclined to\r\ntake so lenient a view of the past; the feminine mind, regarded at that\r\nperiod as less powerful, took a more melancholy view of the case. If Dr\r\nKenn should be beguiled into marrying that Miss Tulliver! It was not\r\nsafe to be too confident, even about the best of men; an apostle had\r\nfallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter\xe2\x80\x99s denial was not\r\na close precedent, his repentance was likely to be.\r\n\r\nMaggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks,\r\nbefore the dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the\r\nRector\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been talked of so often in confidence, that ladies\r\nwere beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that\r\nposition. For Dr Kenn, it had been understood, had sat in the\r\nschoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss Tulliver was giving her\r\nlessons,\xe2\x80\x94nay, he had sat there every morning; he had once walked home\r\nwith her,\xe2\x80\x94he almost _always_ walked home with her,\xe2\x80\x94and if not, he went\r\nto see her in the evening. What an artful creature she was! What a\r\n_mother_ for those children! It was enough to make poor Mrs Kenn turn\r\nin her grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl only\r\na few weeks after her death. Would he be so lost to propriety as to\r\nmarry her before the year was out? The masculine mind was sarcastic,\r\nand thought _not_.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly\r\nin their Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and their\r\nknowledge of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them,\r\nlest he should come back and marry Maggie. They were not among those\r\nwho disbelieved their brother\xe2\x80\x99s letter; but they had no confidence in\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she\r\nhad shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage, and that\r\nshe lingered in St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s, relying on his return to her. They had always\r\nthought her disagreeable; they now thought her artful and proud; having\r\nquite as good grounds for that judgment as you and I probably have for\r\nmany strong opinions of the same kind. Formerly they had not altogether\r\ndelighted in the contemplated match with Lucy, but now their dread of a\r\nmarriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine\r\npity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making\r\nthem desire that he should return to her. As soon as Lucy was able to\r\nleave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this\r\nAugust by going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their\r\nplans that Stephen should be induced to join them. On the very first\r\nhint of gossip concerning Maggie and Dr Kenn, the report was conveyed\r\nin Miss Guest\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her brother.\r\n\r\nMaggie had frequent tidings through her mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr\r\nKenn, of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s gradual progress toward recovery, and her thoughts\r\ntended continually toward her uncle Deane\xe2\x80\x99s house; she hungered for an\r\ninterview with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word\r\nof penitence, to be assured by Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes and lips that she did\r\nnot believe in the willing treachery of those whom she had loved and\r\ntrusted. But she knew that even if her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s indignation had not\r\nclosed his house against her, the agitation of such an interview would\r\nhave been forbidden to Lucy. Only to have seen her without speaking\r\nwould have been some relief; for Maggie was haunted by a face cruel in\r\nits very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers with glad,\r\nsweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory; changed\r\nnow to a sad and weary face by a first heart-stroke. And as the days\r\npassed on, that pale image became more and more distinct; the picture\r\ngrew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand\r\nof remorse; the soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain, were bent\r\nforever on Maggie, and pierced her the more because she could see no\r\nanger in them. But Lucy was not yet able to go to church, or any place\r\nwhere Maggie could see her; and even the hope of that departed, when\r\nthe news was told her by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was really going away in\r\na few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests, who had been heard to\r\nsay that they expected their brother to meet them there.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know\r\nwhat Maggie felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing\r\nthat news from Mrs Glegg,\xe2\x80\x94only those who have known what it is to dread\r\ntheir own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread the\r\nsleeping-potion that was to still her own pain.\r\n\r\nShe sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open\r\ntoward the river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself\r\nundistinguishably to the burthen of her lot. Seated on a chair against\r\nthe window, with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at\r\nthe flowing river, swift with the backward-rushing tide, struggling to\r\nsee still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness, that seemed now\r\nfrom moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that\r\nthrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing the door open, she\r\nthought Mrs Jakin was coming in with her supper, as usual; and with\r\nthat repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and\r\nwretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted\r\nnothing; good little Mrs Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant\r\nremarks. But the next moment, without her having discerned the sound of\r\na footstep, she felt a light hand on her shoulder, and heard a voice\r\nclose to her saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMaggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe face was there,\xe2\x80\x94changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were\r\nthere, with their heart-piercing tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie!\xe2\x80\x9d the soft voice said. \xe2\x80\x9cLucy!\xe2\x80\x9d answered a voice with a sharp\r\nring of anguish in it; and Lucy threw her arms round Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and\r\nleaned her pale cheek against the burning brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stole out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, almost in a whisper, while she sat down close\r\nto Maggie and held her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen papa and the rest were away. Alice\r\nis come with me. I asked her to help me. But I must only stay a little\r\nwhile, because it is so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was easier to say that at first than to say anything else. They sat\r\nlooking at each other. It seemed as if the interview must end without\r\nmore speech, for speech was very difficult. Each felt that there would\r\nbe something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable\r\nwrong. But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct thought began to be\r\noverflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and words burst forth with a\r\nsob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you for coming, Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sobs came thick on each other after that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie, dear, be comforted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy now, putting her cheek against\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s again. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t grieve.\xe2\x80\x9d And she sat still, hoping to soothe\r\nMaggie with that gentle caress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to deceive you, Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, as soon as she could\r\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt always made me wretched that I felt what I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like you\r\nto know. It was because I thought it would all be conquered, and you\r\nmight never see anything to wound you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you never meant to make me unhappy.\r\nIt is a trouble that has come on us all; you have more to bear than I\r\nhave\xe2\x80\x94and you gave him up, when\xe2\x80\x94you did what it must have been very hard\r\nto do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent again a little while, sitting with clasped hands, and\r\ncheeks leaned together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie began again, \xe2\x80\x9c_he_ struggled too. He wanted to be true\r\nto you. He will come back to you. Forgive him\xe2\x80\x94he will be happy then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were wrung forth from Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s deepest soul, with an effort\r\nlike the convulsed clutch of a drowning man. Lucy trembled and was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nA gentle knock came at the door. It was Alice, the maid, who entered\r\nand said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t stay any longer, Miss Deane. They\xe2\x80\x99ll find it out, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be such anger at your coming out so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy rose and said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Alice,\xe2\x80\x94in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to go away on Friday, Maggie,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, when Alice had closed\r\nthe door again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I come back, and am strong, they will let me do\r\nas I like. I shall come to you when I please then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie, with another great effort, \xe2\x80\x9cI pray to God\r\ncontinually that I may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed the little hand that she held between hers, and looked up\r\ninto the face that was bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, that had the solemnity of\r\nconfession in it, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are better than I am. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off there, and said no more. But they clasped each other\r\nagain in a last embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nThe Last Conflict\r\n\r\nIn the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her lonely\r\nroom, battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and\r\nrising again. It was past midnight, and the rain was beating heavily\r\nagainst the window, driven with fitful force by the rushing,\r\nloud-moaning wind. For the day after Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s visit there had been a\r\nsudden change in the weather; the heat and drought had given way to\r\ncold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at intervals; and she had\r\nbeen forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather\r\nshould become more settled. In the counties higher up the Floss the\r\nrains had been continuous, and the completion of the harvest had been\r\narrested. And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower\r\ncourse of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken\r\ntheir heads and talked of sixty years ago, when the same sort of\r\nweather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great floods,\r\nwhich swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery. But\r\nthe younger generation, who had seen several small floods, thought\r\nlightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings; and Bob Jakin,\r\nnaturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck, laughed at his\r\nmother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside,\r\nobserving that but for that they would have had no boats, which were\r\nthe most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to\r\ngo to a distance for food.\r\n\r\nBut the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now.\r\nThere was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of\r\na worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls of snow, had often passed\r\noff, in the experience of the younger ones; and at the very worst, the\r\nbanks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in\r\nwith violence, and so the waters would be carried off, without causing\r\nmore than temporary inconvenience, and losses that would be felt only\r\nby the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.\r\n\r\nAll were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some\r\nsolitary watchers such as Maggie. She was seated in her little parlour\r\ntoward the river, with one candle, that left everything dim in the room\r\nexcept a letter which lay before her on the table. That letter, which\r\nhad come to her to-day, was one of the causes that had kept her up far\r\non into the night, unconscious how the hours were going, careless of\r\nseeking rest, with no image of rest coming across her mind, except of\r\nthat far, far off rest from which there would be no more waking for her\r\ninto this struggling earthly life.\r\n\r\nTwo days before Maggie received that letter, she had been to the\r\nRectory for the last time. The heavy rain would have prevented her from\r\ngoing since; but there was another reason. Dr Kenn, at first\r\nenlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and\r\nslander had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more\r\nfully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male\r\nparishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to\r\novercome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance.\r\nDr Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still\r\ninclined to persevere,\xe2\x80\x94was still averse to give way before a public\r\nsentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he was finally wrought\r\nupon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to\r\nhis office, of avoiding the appearance of evil,\xe2\x80\x94an \xe2\x80\x9cappearance\xe2\x80\x9d that is\r\nalways dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds. Where\r\nthese minds are low and gross, the area of that \xe2\x80\x9cappearance\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nproportionately widened. Perhaps he was in danger of acting from\r\nobstinacy; perhaps it was his duty to succumb. Conscientious people are\r\napt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course; and to\r\nrecede was always painful to Dr Kenn. He made up his mind that he must\r\nadvise Maggie to go away from St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s for a time; and he performed\r\nthat difficult task with as much delicacy as he could, only stating in\r\nvague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a\r\nsource of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely\r\nto obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman. He begged her to allow him\r\nto write to a clerical friend of his, who might possibly take her into\r\nhis own family as governess; and, if not, would probably know of some\r\nother available position for a young woman in whose welfare Dr Kenn\r\nfelt a strong interest.\r\n\r\nPoor Maggie listened with a trembling lip; she could say nothing but a\r\nfaint \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, I shall be grateful\xe2\x80\x9d; and she walked back to her\r\nlodgings, through the driving rain, with a new sense of desolation. She\r\nmust be a lonely wanderer; she must go out among fresh faces, that\r\nwould look at her wonderingly, because the days did not seem joyful to\r\nher; she must begin a new life, in which she would have to rouse\r\nherself to receive new impressions; and she was so unspeakably,\r\nsickeningly weary! There was no home, no help for the erring; even\r\nthose who pitied were constrained to hardness. But ought she to\r\ncomplain? Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of\r\nlife, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to\r\nsome other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new\r\nforce of unselfish human love? All the next day she sat in her lonely\r\nroom, with a window darkened by the cloud and the driving rain,\r\nthinking of that future, and wrestling for patience; for what repose\r\ncould poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling?\r\n\r\nAnd on the third day\xe2\x80\x94this day of which she had just sat out the\r\nclose\xe2\x80\x94the letter had come which was lying on the table before her.\r\n\r\nThe letter was from Stephen. He was come back from Holland; he was at\r\nMudport again, unknown to any of his friends, and had written to her\r\nfrom that place, enclosing the letter to a person whom he trusted in St\r\nOgg\xe2\x80\x99s. From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach; an\r\nappeal against her useless sacrifice of him, of herself, against that\r\nperverted notion of right which led her to crush all his hopes, for the\r\nsake of a mere idea, and not any substantial good,\xe2\x80\x94_his_ hopes, whom\r\nshe loved, and who loved her with that single overpowering passion,\r\nthat worship, which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have written to me that you are to marry Kenn. As if I should\r\nbelieve that! Perhaps they have told you some such fables about me.\r\nPerhaps they tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x98travelling.\xe2\x80\x99 My body has been dragged\r\nabout somewhere; but _I_ have never travelled from the hideous place\r\nwhere you left me; where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage\r\nto find you gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaggie! whose pain can have been like mine? Whose injury is like mine?\r\nWho besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself\r\ninto my soul, so that no other image can come there? Maggie, call me\r\nback to you! Call me back to life and goodness! I am banished from both\r\nnow. I have no motives; I am indifferent to everything. Two months have\r\nonly deepened the certainty that I can never care for life without you.\r\nWrite me one word; say \xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 In two days I should be with you.\r\nMaggie, have you forgotten what it was to be together,\xe2\x80\x94to be within\r\nreach of a look, to be within hearing of each other\xe2\x80\x99s voice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation\r\nhad only just begun. At the entrance of the chill dark cavern, we turn\r\nwith unworn courage from the warm light; but how, when we have trodden\r\nfar in the damp darkness, and have begun to be faint and weary; how, if\r\nthere is a sudden opening above us, and we are invited back again to\r\nthe life-nourishing day? The leap of natural longing from under the\r\npressure of pain is so strong, that all less immediate motives are\r\nlikely to be forgotten\xe2\x80\x94till the pain has been escaped from.\r\n\r\nFor hours Maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain. For hours\r\nevery other thought that she strove to summon was thrust aside by the\r\nimage of Stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him to\r\nher. She did not _read_ the letter: she heard him uttering it, and the\r\nvoice shook her with its old strange power. All the day before she had\r\nbeen filled with the vision of a lonely future through which she must\r\ncarry the burthen of regret, upheld only by clinging faith. And here,\r\nclose within her reach, urging itself upon her even as a claim, was\r\nanother future, in which hard endurance and effort were to be exchanged\r\nfor easy, delicious leaning on another\xe2\x80\x99s loving strength! And yet that\r\npromise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the dire force of\r\nthe temptation to Maggie.\r\n\r\nIt was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s tone of misery, it was the doubt in the justice of her\r\nown resolve, that made the balance tremble, and made her once start\r\nfrom her seat to reach the pen and paper, and write \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut close upon that decisive act, her mind recoiled; and the sense of\r\ncontradiction with her past self in her moments of strength and\r\nclearness came upon her like a pang of conscious degradation. No, she\r\nmust wait; she must pray; the light that had forsaken her would come\r\nagain; she should feel again what she had felt when she had fled away,\r\nunder an inspiration strong enough to conquer agony,\xe2\x80\x94to conquer love;\r\nshe should feel again what she had felt when Lucy stood by her, when\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer\r\npast.\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still, far on into the night, with no impulse to change\r\nher attitude, without active force enough even for the mental act of\r\nprayer; only waiting for the light that would surely come again. It\r\ncame with the memories that no passion could long quench; the long past\r\ncame back to her, and with it the fountains of self-renouncing pity and\r\naffection, of faithfulness and resolve. The words that were marked by\r\nthe quiet hand in the little old book that she had long ago learned by\r\nheart, rushed even to her lips, and found a vent for themselves in a\r\nlow murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of the rain against\r\nthe window and the loud moan and roar of the wind. \xe2\x80\x9cI have received the\r\nCross, I have received it from Thy hand; I will bear it, and bear it\r\ntill death, as Thou hast laid it upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a\r\nsob,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Stephen! It will pass away. You will come back to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the letter, held it to the candle, and let it burn slowly\r\non the hearth. To-morrow she would write to him the last word of\r\nparting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bear it, and bear it till death. But how long it will be before\r\ndeath comes! I am so young, so healthy. How shall I have patience and\r\nstrength? Am I to struggle and fall and repent again? Has life other\r\ntrials as hard for me still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that cry of self-despair, Maggie fell on her knees against the\r\ntable, and buried her sorrow-stricken face. Her soul went out to the\r\nUnseen Pity that would be with her to the end. Surely there was\r\nsomething being taught her by this experience of great need; and she\r\nmust be learning a secret of human tenderness and long-suffering, that\r\nthe less erring could hardly know? \xe2\x80\x9cO God, if my life is to be long,\r\nlet me live to bless and comfort\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about\r\nher knees and feet; it was water flowing under her. She started up; the\r\nstream was flowing under the door that led into the passage. She was\r\nnot bewildered for an instant; she knew it was the flood!\r\n\r\nThe tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last twelve hours\r\nseemed to have left a great calm in her; without screaming, she hurried\r\nwith the candle upstairs to Bob Jakin\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. The door was ajar; she\r\nwent in and shook him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBob, the flood is come! it is in the house; let us see if we can make\r\nthe boats safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lighted his candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her baby,\r\nburst into screams; and then she hurried down again to see if the\r\nwaters were rising fast. There was a step down into the room at the\r\ndoor leading from the staircase; she saw that the water was already on\r\na level with the step. While she was looking, something came with a\r\ntremendous crash against the window, and sent the leaded panes and the\r\nold wooden framework inward in shivers, the water pouring in after it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the boat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cBob, come down to get the boats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s shudder of fear, she plunged through the water,\r\nwhich was rising fast to her knees, and by the glimmering light of the\r\ncandle she had left on the stairs, she mounted on to the window-sill,\r\nand crept into the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and\r\nprotruding through the window. Bob was not long after her, hurrying\r\nwithout shoes or stockings, but with the lanthorn in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99re both here,\xe2\x80\x94both the boats,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, as he got into the\r\none where Maggie was. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful this fastening isn\xe2\x80\x99t broke too,\r\nas well as the mooring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening it, and\r\nmastering an oar, Bob was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred.\r\nWe are not apt to fear for the fearless, when we are companions in\r\ntheir danger, and Bob\xe2\x80\x99s mind was absorbed in possible expedients for\r\nthe safety of the helpless indoors. The fact that Maggie had been up,\r\nhad waked him, and had taken the lead in activity, gave Bob a vague\r\nimpression of her as one who would help to protect, not need to be\r\nprotected. She too had got possession of an oar, and had pushed off, so\r\nas to release the boat from the overhanging window-frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water\xe2\x80\x99s rising so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it\xe2\x80\x99ll be in at the\r\nchambers before long,\xe2\x80\x94th\xe2\x80\x99 house is so low. I\xe2\x80\x99ve more mind to get Prissy\r\nand the child and the mother into the boat, if I could, and trusten to\r\nthe water,\xe2\x80\x94for th\xe2\x80\x99 old house is none so safe. And if I let go the\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x94but _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly lifting the light of his\r\nlanthorn on Maggie, as she stood in the rain with the oar in her hand\r\nand her black hair streaming.\r\n\r\nMaggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept along the\r\nline of the houses, and drove both the boats out on to the wide water,\r\nwith a force that carried them far past the meeting current of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIn the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that\r\nshe had suddenly passed away from that life which she had been\r\ndreading; it was the transition of death, without its agony,\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nwas alone in the darkness with God.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of\r\nordinary association were broken; she sank down on the seat clutching\r\nthe oar mechanically, and for a long while had no distinct conception\r\nof her position. The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness\r\nwas the cessation of the rain, and a perception that the darkness was\r\ndivided by the faintest light, which parted the overhanging gloom from\r\nthe immeasurable watery level below. She was driven out upon the\r\nflood,\xe2\x80\x94that awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of;\r\nwhich had made the nightmare of her childish dreams. And with that\r\nthought there rushed in the vision of the old home, and Tom, and her\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x94they had all listened together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, where am I? Which is the way home?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, in the dim\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening to them at the Mill? The flood had once nearly\r\ndestroyed it. They might be in danger, in distress,\xe2\x80\x94her mother and her\r\nbrother, alone there, beyond reach of help! Her whole soul was strained\r\nnow on that thought; and she saw the long-loved faces looking for help\r\ninto the darkness, and finding none.\r\n\r\nShe was floating in smooth water now,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps far on the overflooded\r\nfields. There was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of\r\nher mind to the old home; and she strained her eyes against the curtain\r\nof gloom that she might seize the first sight of her whereabout,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nshe might catch some faint suggestion of the spot toward which all her\r\nanxieties tended.\r\n\r\nOh, how welcome, the widening of that dismal watery level, the gradual\r\nuplifting of the cloudy firmament, the slowly defining blackness of\r\nobjects above the glassy dark! Yes, she must be out on the fields;\r\nthose were the tops of hedgerow trees. Which way did the river lie?\r\nLooking behind her, she saw the lines of black trees; looking before\r\nher, there were none; then the river lay before her. She seized an oar\r\nand began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope;\r\nthe dawning seemed to advance more swiftly, now she was in action; and\r\nshe could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound\r\nwhere they had taken refuge. Onward she paddled and rowed by turns in\r\nthe growing twilight; her wet clothes clung round her, and her\r\nstreaming hair was dashed about by the wind, but she was hardly\r\nconscious of any bodily sensations,\xe2\x80\x94except a sensation of strength,\r\ninspired by mighty emotion. Along with the sense of danger and possible\r\nrescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home, there was an\r\nundefined sense of reconcilement with her brother; what quarrel, what\r\nharshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a\r\ngreat calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our life is gone,\r\nand we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs? Vaguely\r\nMaggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that\r\nswept away all the later impressions of hard, cruel offence and\r\nmisunderstanding, and left only the deep, underlying, unshakable\r\nmemories of early union.\r\n\r\nBut now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and near to her\r\nMaggie could discern the current of the river. The dark mass must\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94yes, it was\xe2\x80\x94St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Ah, now she knew which way to look for the\r\nfirst glimpse of the well-known trees\xe2\x80\x94the gray willows, the now\r\nyellowing chestnuts\xe2\x80\x94and above them the old roof! But there was no\r\ncolour, no shape yet; all was faint and dim. More and more strongly the\r\nenergies seemed to come and put themselves forth, as if her life were a\r\nstored-up force that was being spent in this hour, unneeded for any\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nShe must get her boat into the current of the Floss, else she would\r\nnever be able to pass the Ripple and approach the house; this was the\r\nthought that occurred to her, as she imagined with more and more\r\nvividness the state of things round the old home. But then she might be\r\ncarried very far down, and be unable to guide her boat out of the\r\ncurrent again. For the first time distinct ideas of danger began to\r\npress upon her; but there was no choice of courses, no room for\r\nhesitation, and she floated into the current. Swiftly she went now\r\nwithout effort; more and more clearly in the lessening distance and the\r\ngrowing light she began to discern the objects that she knew must be\r\nthe well-known trees and roofs; nay, she was not far off a rushing,\r\nmuddy current that must be the strangely altered Ripple.\r\n\r\nGreat God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash against\r\nher boat as she passed, and cause her to perish too soon. What were\r\nthose masses?\r\n\r\nFor the first time Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat in an agony of dread.\r\nShe sat helpless, dimly conscious that she was being floated along,\r\nmore intensely conscious of the anticipated clash. But the horror was\r\ntransient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St Ogg\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nShe had passed the mouth of the Ripple, then; _now_, she must use all\r\nher skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of\r\nthe current. She could see now that the bridge was broken down; she\r\ncould see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field.\r\nBut no boats were to be seen moving on the river,\xe2\x80\x94such as had been laid\r\nhands on were employed in the flooded streets.\r\n\r\nWith new resolution, Maggie seized her oar, and stood up again to\r\npaddle; but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river,\r\nand she was carried along beyond the bridge. She could hear shouts from\r\nthe windows overlooking the river, as if the people there were calling\r\nto her. It was not till she had passed on nearly to Tofton that she\r\ncould get the boat clear of the current. Then with one yearning look\r\ntoward her uncle Deane\xe2\x80\x99s house that lay farther down the river, she\r\ntook to both her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery\r\nfields, back toward the Mill. Colour was beginning to awake now, and as\r\nshe approached the Dorlcote fields, she could discern the tints of the\r\ntrees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the right, and the home\r\nchestnuts,\xe2\x80\x94oh, how deep they lay in the water,\xe2\x80\x94deeper than the trees on\r\nthis side the hill! And the roof of the Mill\xe2\x80\x94where was it? Those heavy\r\nfragments hurrying down the Ripple,\xe2\x80\x94what had they meant? But it was not\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x94the house stood firm; drowned up to the first story, but\r\nstill firm,\xe2\x80\x94or was it broken in at the end toward the Mill?\r\n\r\nWith panting joy that she was there at last,\xe2\x80\x94joy that overcame all\r\ndistress,\xe2\x80\x94Maggie neared the front of the house. At first she heard no\r\nsound; she saw no object moving. Her boat was on a level with the\r\nupstairs window. She called out in a loud, piercing voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she heard\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? Have you brought a boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, Tom,\xe2\x80\x94Maggie. Where is mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\ndown to the lower window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he\r\nopened the middle window, on a level with the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in\r\nquickly. Is there no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, stepping into the boat; \xe2\x80\x9cI fear the man is drowned; he\r\nwas carried down the Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell with\r\nthe crash of trees and stones against it; I\xe2\x80\x99ve shouted again and again,\r\nand there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nface to face with Maggie,\xe2\x80\x94that the full meaning of what had happened\r\nrushed upon his mind. It came with so overpowering a force,\xe2\x80\x94it was such\r\na new revelation to his spirit, of the depths in life that had lain\r\nbeyond his vision, which he had fancied so keen and clear,\xe2\x80\x94that he was\r\nunable to ask a question. They sat mutely gazing at each other,\xe2\x80\x94Maggie\r\nwith eyes of intense life looking out from a weary, beaten face; Tom\r\npale, with a certain awe and humiliation. Thought was busy though the\r\nlips were silent; and though he could ask no question, he guessed a\r\nstory of almost miraculous, divinely protected effort. But at last a\r\nmist gathered over the blue-gray eyes, and the lips found a word they\r\ncould utter,\xe2\x80\x94the old childish \xe2\x80\x9cMagsie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that mysterious,\r\nwondrous happiness that is one with pain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could speak, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go to Lucy, Tom; we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo and see if she is safe, and then we can help the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed from poor\r\nMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s. The boat was soon in the current of the river again, and soon\r\nthey would be at Tofton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPark House stands high up out of the flood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maggie. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nthey have got Lucy there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing else was said; a new danger was being carried toward them by\r\nthe river. Some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the\r\nwharves, and huge fragments were being floated along. The sun was\r\nrising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in\r\ndreadful clearness around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward\r\nthe hurrying, threatening masses. A large company in a boat that was\r\nworking its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger,\r\nand shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of the current!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him, saw\r\ndeath rushing on them. Huge fragments, clinging together in fatal\r\nfellowship, made one wide mass across the stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is coming, Maggie!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice, loosing the\r\noars, and clasping her.\r\n\r\nThe next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water, and the\r\nhuge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph.\r\n\r\nBut soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on the golden\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace\r\nnever to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days\r\nwhen they had clasped their little hands in love, and roamed the\r\ndaisied fields together.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nNature repairs her ravages,\xe2\x80\x94repairs them with her sunshine, and with\r\nhuman labour. The desolation wrought by that flood had left little\r\nvisible trace on the face of the earth, five years after. The fifth\r\nautumn was rich in golden cornstacks, rising in thick clusters among\r\nthe distant hedgerows; the wharves and warehouses on the Floss were\r\nbusy again, with echoes of eager voices, with hopeful lading and\r\nunlading.\r\n\r\nAnd every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living,\r\nexcept those whose end we know.\r\n\r\nNature repairs her ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees are not\r\nrooted again; the parted hills are left scarred; if there is a new\r\ngrowth, the trees are not the same as the old, and the hills underneath\r\ntheir green vesture bear the marks of the past rending. To the eyes\r\nthat have dwelt on the past, there is no thorough repair.\r\n\r\nDorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote churchyard\xe2\x80\x94where the brick\r\ngrave that held a father whom we know, was found with the stone laid\r\nprostrate upon it after the flood\xe2\x80\x94had recovered all its grassy order\r\nand decent quiet.\r\n\r\nNear that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon after the\r\nflood, for two bodies that were found in close embrace; and it was\r\nvisited at different moments by two men who both felt that their\r\nkeenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there.\r\n\r\nOne of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him; but\r\nthat was years after.\r\n\r\nThe other was always solitary. His great companionship was among the\r\ntrees of the Red Deeps, where the buried joy seemed still to hover,\r\nlike a revisiting spirit.\r\n\r\nThe tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and below the names\r\nit was written,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn their death they were not divided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MILL ON THE FLOSS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
