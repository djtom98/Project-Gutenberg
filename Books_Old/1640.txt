I saw the setting\r\nsun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine wood. Its golden\r\nrays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble hall. I\r\nwas impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining\r\nfamily had settled there in that part of the land called Concord,\r\nunknown to me,--to whom the sun was servant,--who had not gone into\r\nsociety in the village,--who had not been called on. I saw their\r\npark, their pleasure-ground, beyond through the wood, in Spaulding\'s\r\ncranberry-meadow. The pines furnished them with gables as they grew.\r\nTheir house was not obvious to vision; their trees grew through it. I\r\ndo not know whether I heard the sounds of a suppressed hilarity or not.\r\nThey seemed to recline on the sunbeams. They have sons and daughters.\r\nThey are quite well. The farmer\'s cart-path, which leads directly\r\nthrough their hall, does not in the least put them out,--as the muddy\r\nbottom of a pool is sometimes seen through the reflected skies.\r\nThey never heard of Spaulding, and do not know that he is their\r\nneighbor,--notwithstanding I heard him whistle as he drove his team\r\nthrough the house. Nothing can equal the serenity of their lives. Their\r\ncoat of arms is simply a lichen. I saw it painted on the pines and oaks.\r\nTheir attics were in the tops of the trees. They are of no politics.\r\nThere was no noise of labor. I did not perceive that they were weaving\r\nor spinning. Yet I did detect, when the wind lulled and hearing was done\r\naway, the finest imaginable sweet musical hum,--as of a distant hive in\r\nMay, which perchance was the sound of their thinking. They had no idle\r\nthoughts, and no one without could see their work, for their industry\r\nwas not as in knots and excrescences embayed.\r\n\r\nBut I find it difficult to remember them. They fade irrevocably out\r\nof my mind even now while I speak and endeavor to recall them, and\r\nrecollect myself. It is only after a long and serious effort to\r\nrecollect my best thoughts that I become again aware of their\r\ncohabitancy. If it were not for such families as this, I think I should\r\nmove out of Concord.\r\n\r\nThoreau: "WALKING."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\nI had just finished my studies at Oxford, and was taking a brief holiday\r\nfrom work before assuming definitely the management of the estate. My\r\nfather died when I was yet a child; my mother followed him within a\r\nyear; and I was nearly as much alone in the world as a man might find\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI had made little acquaintance with the history of my ancestors. Almost\r\nthe only thing I knew concerning them was, that a notable number of them\r\nhad been given to study. I had myself so far inherited the tendency as\r\nto devote a good deal of my time, though, I confess, after a somewhat\r\ndesultory fashion, to the physical sciences. It was chiefly the wonder\r\nthey woke that drew me. I was constantly seeing, and on the outlook to\r\nsee, strange analogies, not only between the facts of different sciences\r\nof the same order, or between physical and metaphysical facts, but\r\nbetween physical hypotheses and suggestions glimmering out of the\r\nmetaphysical dreams into which I was in the habit of falling. I was at\r\nthe same time much given to a premature indulgence of the impulse to\r\nturn hypothesis into theory. Of my mental peculiarities there is no\r\noccasion to say more.\r\n\r\nThe house as well as the family was of some antiquity, but no\r\ndescription of it is necessary to the understanding of my narrative.\r\nIt contained a fine library, whose growth began before the invention\r\nof printing, and had continued to my own time, greatly influenced, of\r\ncourse, by changes of taste and pursuit. Nothing surely can more impress\r\nupon a man the transitory nature of possession than his succeeding to\r\nan ancient property! Like a moving panorama mine has passed from before\r\nmany eyes, and is now slowly flitting from before my own.\r\n\r\nThe library, although duly considered in many alterations of the house\r\nand additions to it, had nevertheless, like an encroaching state,\r\nabsorbed one room after another until it occupied the greater part of\r\nthe ground floor. Its chief room was large, and the walls of it were\r\ncovered with books almost to the ceiling; the rooms into which it\r\noverflowed were of various sizes and shapes, and communicated in modes\r\nas various--by doors, by open arches, by short passages, by steps up and\r\nsteps down.\r\n\r\nIn the great room I mainly spent my time, reading books of science,\r\nold as well as new; for the history of the human mind in relation to\r\nsupposed knowledge was what most of all interested me. Ptolemy, Dante,\r\nthe two Bacons, and Boyle were even more to me than Darwin or Maxwell,\r\nas so much nearer the vanished van breaking into the dark of ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of a gloomy day of August I was sitting in my usual\r\nplace, my back to one of the windows, reading. It had rained the greater\r\npart of the morning and afternoon, but just as the sun was setting, the\r\nclouds parted in front of him, and he shone into the room. I rose and\r\nlooked out of the window. In the centre of the great lawn the feathering\r\ntop of the fountain column was filled with his red glory. I turned to\r\nresume my seat, when my eye was caught by the same glory on the one\r\npicture in the room--a portrait, in a sort of niche or little shrine\r\nsunk for it in the expanse of book-filled shelves. I knew it as the\r\nlikeness of one of my ancestors, but had never even wondered why it hung\r\nthere alone, and not in the gallery, or one of the great rooms, among\r\nthe other family portraits. The direct sunlight brought out the painting\r\nwonderfully; for the first time I seemed to see it, and for the first\r\ntime it seemed to respond to my look. With my eyes full of the light\r\nreflected from it, something, I cannot tell what, made me turn and cast\r\na glance to the farther end of the room, when I saw, or seemed to see,\r\na tall figure reaching up a hand to a bookshelf. The next instant, my\r\nvision apparently rectified by the comparative dusk, I saw no one,\r\nand concluded that my optic nerves had been momentarily affected from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nI resumed my reading, and would doubtless have forgotten the vague,\r\nevanescent impression, had it not been that, having occasion a moment\r\nafter to consult a certain volume, I found but a gap in the row where it\r\nought to have stood, and the same instant remembered that just there I\r\nhad seen, or fancied I saw, the old man in search of a book. I looked\r\nall about the spot but in vain. The next morning, however, there it\r\nwas, just where I had thought to find it! I knew of no one in the house\r\nlikely to be interested in such a book.\r\n\r\nThree days after, another and yet odder thing took place.\r\n\r\nIn one of the walls was the low, narrow door of a closet, containing\r\nsome of the oldest and rarest of the books. It was a very thick door,\r\nwith a projecting frame, and it had been the fancy of some ancestor to\r\ncross it with shallow shelves, filled with book-backs only. The harmless\r\ntrick may be excused by the fact that the titles on the sham backs\r\nwere either humorously original, or those of books lost beyond hope of\r\nrecovery. I had a great liking for the masked door.\r\n\r\nTo complete the illusion of it, some inventive workman apparently had\r\nshoved in, on the top of one of the rows, a part of a volume thin enough\r\nto lie between it and the bottom of the next shelf: he had cut away\r\ndiagonally a considerable portion, and fixed the remnant with one of\r\nits open corners projecting beyond the book-backs. The binding of the\r\nmutilated volume was limp vellum, and one could open the corner far\r\nenough to see that it was manuscript upon parchment.\r\n\r\nHappening, as I sat reading, to raise my eyes from the page, my glance\r\nfell upon this door, and at once I saw that the book described, if\r\nbook it may be called, was gone. Angrier than any worth I knew in it\r\njustified, I rang the bell, and the butler appeared. When I asked him if\r\nhe knew what had befallen it, he turned pale, and assured me he did not.\r\nI could less easily doubt his word than my own eyes, for he had been all\r\nhis life in the family, and a more faithful servant never lived. He left\r\non me the impression, nevertheless, that he could have said something\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I was again reading in the library, and coming to a\r\npoint which demanded reflection, I lowered the book and let my eyes go\r\nwandering. The same moment I saw the back of a slender old man, in a\r\nlong, dark coat, shiny as from much wear, in the act of disappearing\r\nthrough the masked door into the closet beyond. I darted across the\r\nroom, found the door shut, pulled it open, looked into the closet,\r\nwhich had no other issue, and, seeing nobody, concluded, not without\r\nuneasiness, that I had had a recurrence of my former illusion, and sat\r\ndown again to my reading.\r\n\r\nNaturally, however, I could not help feeling a little nervous, and\r\npresently glancing up to assure myself that I was indeed alone,\r\nstarted again to my feet, and ran to the masked door--for there was\r\nthe mutilated volume in its place! I laid hold of it and pulled: it was\r\nfirmly fixed as usual!\r\n\r\nI was now utterly bewildered. I rang the bell; the butler came; I told\r\nhim all I had seen, and he told me all he knew.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped, he said, that the old gentleman was going to be forgotten;\r\nit was well no one but myself had seen him. He had heard a good deal\r\nabout him when first he served in the house, but by degrees he had\r\nceased to be mentioned, and he had been very careful not to allude to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"The place was haunted by an old gentleman, was it?" I said.\r\n\r\nHe answered that at one time everybody believed it, but the fact that I\r\nhad never heard of it seemed to imply that the thing had come to an end\r\nand was forgotten.\r\n\r\nI questioned him as to what he had seen of the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen him, he said, although he had been in the house from\r\nthe day my father was eight years old. My grandfather would never hear\r\na word on the matter, declaring that whoever alluded to it should be\r\ndismissed without a moment\'s warning: it was nothing but a pretext of\r\nthe maids, he said, for running into the arms of the men! but old Sir\r\nRalph believed in nothing he could not see or lay hold of. Not one of\r\nthe maids ever said she had seen the apparition, but a footman had left\r\nthe place because of it.\r\n\r\nAn ancient woman in the village had told him a legend concerning a Mr.\r\nRaven, long time librarian to "that Sir Upward whose portrait hangs\r\nthere among the books." Sir Upward was a great reader, she said--not\r\nof such books only as were wholesome for men to read, but of strange,\r\nforbidden, and evil books; and in so doing, Mr. Raven, who was probably\r\nthe devil himself, encouraged him. Suddenly they both disappeared, and\r\nSir Upward was never after seen or heard of, but Mr. Raven continued to\r\nshow himself at uncertain intervals in the library. There were some who\r\nbelieved he was not dead; but both he and the old woman held it easier\r\nto believe that a dead man might revisit the world he had left, than\r\nthat one who went on living for hundreds of years should be a man at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe had never heard that Mr. Raven meddled with anything in the house,\r\nbut he might perhaps consider himself privileged in regard to the books.\r\nHow the old woman had learned so much about him he could not tell; but\r\nthe description she gave of him corresponded exactly with the figure I\r\nhad just seen.\r\n\r\n"I hope it was but a friendly call on the part of the old gentleman!" he\r\nconcluded, with a troubled smile.\r\n\r\nI told him I had no objection to any number of visits from Mr. Raven,\r\nbut it would be well he should keep to his resolution of saying nothing\r\nabout him to the servants. Then I asked him if he had ever seen the\r\nmutilated volume out of its place; he answered that he never had, and\r\nhad always thought it a fixture. With that he went to it, and gave it a\r\npull: it seemed immovable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE MIRROR\r\n\r\nNothing more happened for some days. I think it was about a week after,\r\nwhen what I have now to tell took place.\r\n\r\nI had often thought of the manuscript fragment, and repeatedly tried\r\nto discover some way of releasing it, but in vain: I could not find out\r\nwhat held it fast.\r\n\r\nBut I had for some time intended a thorough overhauling of the books in\r\nthe closet, its atmosphere causing me uneasiness as to their condition.\r\nOne day the intention suddenly became a resolve, and I was in the act of\r\nrising from my chair to make a beginning, when I saw the old librarian\r\nmoving from the door of the closet toward the farther end of the room.\r\nI ought rather to say only that I caught sight of something shadowy from\r\nwhich I received the impression of a slight, stooping man, in a shabby\r\ndress-coat reaching almost to his heels, the tails of which, disparting\r\na little as he walked, revealed thin legs in black stockings, and large\r\nfeet in wide, slipper-like shoes.\r\n\r\nAt once I followed him: I might be following a shadow, but I never\r\ndoubted I was following something. He went out of the library into the\r\nhall, and across to the foot of the great staircase, then up the stairs\r\nto the first floor, where lay the chief rooms. Past these rooms, I\r\nfollowing close, he continued his way, through a wide corridor, to the\r\nfoot of a narrower stair leading to the second floor. Up that he went\r\nalso, and when I reached the top, strange as it may seem, I found myself\r\nin a region almost unknown to me. I never had brother or sister to\r\nincite to such romps as make children familiar with nook and cranny; I\r\nwas a mere child when my guardian took me away; and I had never seen the\r\nhouse again until, about a month before, I returned to take possession.\r\n\r\nThrough passage after passage we came to a door at the bottom of a\r\nwinding wooden stair, which we ascended. Every step creaked under my\r\nfoot, but I heard no sound from that of my guide. Somewhere in the\r\nmiddle of the stair I lost sight of him, and from the top of it the\r\nshadowy shape was nowhere visible. I could not even imagine I saw him.\r\nThe place was full of shadows, but he was not one of them.\r\n\r\nI was in the main garret, with huge beams and rafters over my head,\r\ngreat spaces around me, a door here and there in sight, and long vistas\r\nwhose gloom was thinned by a few lurking cobwebbed windows and small\r\ndusky skylights. I gazed with a strange mingling of awe and pleasure:\r\nthe wide expanse of garret was my own, and unexplored!\r\n\r\nIn the middle of it stood an unpainted inclosure of rough planks, the\r\ndoor of which was ajar. Thinking Mr. Raven might be there, I pushed the\r\ndoor, and entered.\r\n\r\nThe small chamber was full of light, but such as dwells in places\r\ndeserted: it had a dull, disconsolate look, as if it found itself of no\r\nuse, and regretted having come. A few rather dim sunrays, marking their\r\ntrack through the cloud of motes that had just been stirred up,\r\nfell upon a tall mirror with a dusty face, old-fashioned and rather\r\nnarrow--in appearance an ordinary glass. It had an ebony frame, on the\r\ntop of which stood a black eagle, with outstretched wings, in his beak a\r\ngolden chain, from whose end hung a black ball.\r\n\r\nI had been looking at rather than into the mirror, when suddenly I\r\nbecame aware that it reflected neither the chamber nor my own person. I\r\nhave an impression of having seen the wall melt away, but what followed\r\nis enough to account for any uncertainty:--could I have mistaken for a\r\nmirror the glass that protected a wonderful picture?\r\n\r\nI saw before me a wild country, broken and heathy. Desolate hills of\r\nno great height, but somehow of strange appearance, occupied the middle\r\ndistance; along the horizon stretched the tops of a far-off mountain\r\nrange; nearest me lay a tract of moorland, flat and melancholy.\r\n\r\nBeing short-sighted, I stepped closer to examine the texture of a stone\r\nin the immediate foreground, and in the act espied, hopping toward me\r\nwith solemnity, a large and ancient raven, whose purply black was here\r\nand there softened with gray. He seemed looking for worms as he came.\r\nNowise astonished at the appearance of a live creature in a picture,\r\nI took another step forward to see him better, stumbled over\r\nsomething--doubtless the frame of the mirror--and stood nose to beak\r\nwith the bird: I was in the open air, on a houseless heath!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE RAVEN\r\n\r\nI turned and looked behind me: all was vague and uncertain, as when\r\none cannot distinguish between fog and field, between cloud and\r\nmountain-side. One fact only was plain--that I saw nothing I knew.\r\nImagining myself involved in a visual illusion, and that touch would\r\ncorrect sight, I stretched my arms and felt about me, walking in this\r\ndirection and that, if haply, where I could see nothing, I might yet\r\ncome in contact with something; but my search was vain. Instinctively\r\nthen, as to the only living thing near me, I turned to the raven,\r\nwhich stood a little way off, regarding me with an expression at once\r\nrespectful and quizzical. Then the absurdity of seeking counsel from\r\nsuch a one struck me, and I turned again, overwhelmed with bewilderment,\r\nnot unmingled with fear. Had I wandered into a region where both the\r\nmaterial and psychical relations of our world had ceased to hold? Might\r\na man at any moment step beyond the realm of order, and become the sport\r\nof the lawless? Yet I saw the raven, felt the ground under my feet, and\r\nheard a sound as of wind in the lowly plants around me!\r\n\r\n"How DID I get here?" I said--apparently aloud, for the question was\r\nimmediately answered.\r\n\r\n"You came through the door," replied an odd, rather harsh voice.\r\n\r\nI looked behind, then all about me, but saw no human shape. The terror\r\nthat madness might be at hand laid hold upon me: must I henceforth place\r\nno confidence either in my senses or my consciousness? The same instant\r\nI knew it was the raven that had spoken, for he stood looking up at me\r\nwith an air of waiting. The sun was not shining, yet the bird seemed to\r\ncast a shadow, and the shadow seemed part of himself.\r\n\r\nI beg my reader to aid me in the endeavour to make myself\r\nintelligible--if here understanding be indeed possible between us. I was\r\nin a world, or call it a state of things, an economy of conditions, an\r\nidea of existence, so little correspondent with the ways and modes of\r\nthis world--which we are apt to think the only world, that the best\r\nchoice I can make of word or phrase is but an adumbration of what\r\nI would convey. I begin indeed to fear that I have undertaken an\r\nimpossibility, undertaken to tell what I cannot tell because no speech\r\nat my command will fit the forms in my mind. Already I have set down\r\nstatements I would gladly change did I know how to substitute a truer\r\nutterance; but as often as I try to fit the reality with nearer words, I\r\nfind myself in danger of losing the things themselves, and feel like one\r\nin process of awaking from a dream, with the thing that seemed familiar\r\ngradually yet swiftly changing through a succession of forms until its\r\nvery nature is no longer recognisable.\r\n\r\nI bethought me that a bird capable of addressing a man must have the\r\nright of a man to a civil answer; perhaps, as a bird, even a greater\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nA tendency to croak caused a certain roughness in his speech, but his\r\nvoice was not disagreeable, and what he said, although conveying little\r\nenlightenment, did not sound rude.\r\n\r\n"I did not come through any door," I rejoined.\r\n\r\n"I saw you come through it!--saw you with my own ancient eyes!" asserted\r\nthe raven, positively but not disrespectfully.\r\n\r\n"I never saw any door!" I persisted.\r\n\r\n"Of course not!" he returned; "all the doors you had yet seen--and you\r\nhaven\'t seen many--were doors in; here you came upon a door out! The\r\nstrange thing to you," he went on thoughtfully, "will be, that the more\r\ndoors you go out of, the farther you get in!"\r\n\r\n"Oblige me by telling me where I am."\r\n\r\n"That is impossible. You know nothing about whereness. The only way to\r\ncome to know where you are is to begin to make yourself at home."\r\n\r\n"How am I to begin that where everything is so strange?"\r\n\r\n"By doing something."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Anything; and the sooner you begin the better! for until you are at\r\nhome, you will find it as difficult to get out as it is to get in."\r\n\r\n"I have, unfortunately, found it too easy to get in; once out I shall\r\nnot try again!"\r\n\r\n"You have stumbled in, and may, possibly, stumble out again. Whether you\r\nhave got in UNFORTUNATELY remains to be seen."\r\n\r\n"Do you never go out, sir?"\r\n\r\n"When I please I do, but not often, or for long. Your world is such\r\na half-baked sort of place, it is at once so childish and so\r\nself-satisfied--in fact, it is not sufficiently developed for an old\r\nraven--at your service!"\r\n\r\n"Am I wrong, then, in presuming that a man is superior to a bird?"\r\n\r\n"That is as it may be. We do not waste our intellects in generalising,\r\nbut take man or bird as we find him.--I think it is now my turn to ask\r\nyou a question!"\r\n\r\n"You have the best of rights," I replied, "in the fact that you CAN do\r\nso!"\r\n\r\n"Well answered!" he rejoined. "Tell me, then, who you are--if you happen\r\nto know."\r\n\r\n"How should I help knowing? I am myself, and must know!"\r\n\r\n"If you know you are yourself, you know that you are not somebody else;\r\nbut do you know that you are yourself? Are you sure you are not your own\r\nfather?--or, excuse me, your own fool?--Who are you, pray?"\r\n\r\nI became at once aware that I could give him no notion of who I was.\r\nIndeed, who was I? It would be no answer to say I was who! Then I\r\nunderstood that I did not know myself, did not know what I was, had no\r\ngrounds on which to determine that I was one and not another. As for the\r\nname I went by in my own world, I had forgotten it, and did not care to\r\nrecall it, for it meant nothing, and what it might be was plainly of\r\nno consequence here. I had indeed almost forgotten that there it was a\r\ncustom for everybody to have a name! So I held my peace, and it was my\r\nwisdom; for what should I say to a creature such as this raven, who saw\r\nthrough accident into entity?\r\n\r\n"Look at me," he said, "and tell me who I am."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he turned his back, and instantly I knew him. He was no\r\nlonger a raven, but a man above the middle height with a stoop, very\r\nthin, and wearing a long black tail-coat. Again he turned, and I saw him\r\na raven.\r\n\r\n"I have seen you before, sir," I said, feeling foolish rather than\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n"How can you say so from seeing me behind?" he rejoined. "Did you ever\r\nsee yourself behind? You have never seen yourself at all!--Tell me now,\r\nthen, who I am."\r\n\r\n"I humbly beg your pardon," I answered: "I believe you were once the\r\nlibrarian of our house, but more WHO I do not know."\r\n\r\n"Why do you beg my pardon?"\r\n\r\n"Because I took you for a raven," I said--seeing him before me as\r\nplainly a raven as bird or man could look.\r\n\r\n"You did me no wrong," he returned. "Calling me a raven, or thinking me\r\none, you allowed me existence, which is the sum of what one can\r\ndemand of his fellow-beings. Therefore, in return, I will give you a\r\nlesson:--No one can say he is himself, until first he knows that he IS,\r\nand then what HIMSELF is. In fact, nobody is himself, and himself is\r\nnobody. There is more in it than you can see now, but not more than you\r\nneed to see. You have, I fear, got into this region too soon, but none\r\nthe less you must get to be at home in it; for home, as you may or\r\nmay not know, is the only place where you can go out and in. There are\r\nplaces you can go into, and places you can go out of; but the one place,\r\nif you do but find it, where you may go out and in both, is home."\r\n\r\nHe turned to walk away, and again I saw the librarian. He did not appear\r\nto have changed, only to have taken up his shadow. I know this seems\r\nnonsense, but I cannot help it.\r\n\r\nI gazed after him until I saw him no more; but whether distance hid him,\r\nor he disappeared among the heather, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nCould it be that I was dead, I thought, and did not know it? Was I in\r\nwhat we used to call the world beyond the grave? and must I wander about\r\nseeking my place in it? How was I to find myself at home? The raven\r\nsaid I must do something: what could I do here?--And would that make me\r\nsomebody? for now, alas, I was nobody!\r\n\r\nI took the way Mr. Raven had gone, and went slowly after him. Presently\r\nI saw a wood of tall slender pine-trees, and turned toward it. The odour\r\nof it met me on my way, and I made haste to bury myself in it.\r\n\r\nPlunged at length in its twilight glooms, I spied before me something\r\nwith a shine, standing between two of the stems. It had no colour,\r\nbut was like the translucent trembling of the hot air that rises, in a\r\nradiant summer noon, from the sun-baked ground, vibrant like the smitten\r\nchords of a musical instrument. What it was grew no plainer as I went\r\nnearer, and when I came close up, I ceased to see it, only the form\r\nand colour of the trees beyond seemed strangely uncertain. I would have\r\npassed between the stems, but received a slight shock, stumbled,\r\nand fell. When I rose, I saw before me the wooden wall of the garret\r\nchamber. I turned, and there was the mirror, on whose top the black\r\neagle seemed but that moment to have perched.\r\n\r\nTerror seized me, and I fled. Outside the chamber the wide garret\r\nspaces had an UNCANNY look. They seemed to have long been waiting for\r\nsomething; it had come, and they were waiting again! A shudder went\r\nthrough me on the winding stair: the house had grown strange to me!\r\nsomething was about to leap upon me from behind! I darted down the\r\nspiral, struck against the wall and fell, rose and ran. On the next\r\nfloor I lost my way, and had gone through several passages a second time\r\nere I found the head of the stair. At the top of the great stair I had\r\ncome to myself a little, and in a few moments I sat recovering my breath\r\nin the library.\r\n\r\nNothing should ever again make me go up that last terrible stair!\r\nThe garret at the top of it pervaded the whole house! It sat upon it,\r\nthreatening to crush me out of it! The brooding brain of the building,\r\nit was full of mysterious dwellers, one or other of whom might any\r\nmoment appear in the library where I sat! I was nowhere safe! I would\r\nlet, I would sell the dreadful place, in which an aerial portal stood\r\never open to creatures whose life was other than human! I would purchase\r\na crag in Switzerland, and thereon build a wooden nest of one story with\r\nnever a garret above it, guarded by some grand old peak that would send\r\ndown nothing worse than a few tons of whelming rock!\r\n\r\nI knew all the time that my thinking was foolish, and was even aware of\r\na certain undertone of contemptuous humour in it; but suddenly it was\r\nchecked, and I seemed again to hear the croak of the raven.\r\n\r\n"If I know nothing of my own garret," I thought, "what is there\r\nto secure me against my own brain? Can I tell what it is even now\r\ngenerating?--what thought it may present me the next moment, the next\r\nmonth, or a year away? What is at the heart of my brain? What is behind\r\nmy THINK? Am I there at all?--Who, what am I?"\r\n\r\nI could no more answer the question now than when the raven put it to\r\nme in--at--"Where in?--where at?" I said, and gave myself up as knowing\r\nanything of myself or the universe.\r\n\r\nI started to my feet, hurried across the room to the masked door, where\r\nthe mutilated volume, sticking out from the flat of soulless, bodiless,\r\nnon-existent books, appeared to beckon me, went down on my knees, and\r\nopened it as far as its position would permit, but could see nothing. I\r\ngot up again, lighted a taper, and peeping as into a pair of reluctant\r\njaws, perceived that the manuscript was verse. Further I could not carry\r\ndiscovery. Beginnings of lines were visible on the left-hand page,\r\nand ends of lines on the other; but I could not, of course, get at the\r\nbeginning and end of a single line, and was unable, in what I could\r\nread, to make any guess at the sense. The mere words, however, woke in\r\nme feelings which to describe was, from their strangeness, impossible.\r\nSome dreams, some poems, some musical phrases, some pictures, wake\r\nfeelings such as one never had before, new in colour and form--spiritual\r\nsensations, as it were, hitherto unproved: here, some of the phrases,\r\nsome of the senseless half-lines, some even of the individual words\r\naffected me in similar fashion--as with the aroma of an idea, rousing\r\nin me a great longing to know what the poem or poems might, even yet in\r\ntheir mutilation, hold or suggest.\r\n\r\nI copied out a few of the larger shreds attainable, and tried hard to\r\ncomplete some of the lines, but without the least success. The only\r\nthing I gained in the effort was so much weariness that, when I went to\r\nbed, I fell asleep at once and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nIn the morning all that horror of the empty garret spaces had left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. SOMEWHERE OR NOWHERE?\r\n\r\nThe sun was very bright, but I doubted if the day would long be fine,\r\nand looked into the milky sapphire I wore, to see whether the star in it\r\nwas clear. It was even less defined than I had expected. I rose from the\r\nbreakfast-table, and went to the window to glance at the stone again.\r\nThere had been heavy rain in the night, and on the lawn was a thrush\r\nbreaking his way into the shell of a snail.\r\n\r\nAs I was turning my ring about to catch the response of the star to the\r\nsun, I spied a keen black eye gazing at me out of the milky misty blue.\r\nThe sight startled me so that I dropped the ring, and when I picked it\r\nup the eye was gone from it. The same moment the sun was obscured;\r\na dark vapour covered him, and in a minute or two the whole sky was\r\nclouded. The air had grown sultry, and a gust of wind came suddenly.\r\nA moment more and there was a flash of lightning, with a single sharp\r\nthunder-clap. Then the rain fell in torrents.\r\n\r\nI had opened the window, and stood there looking out at the precipitous\r\nrain, when I descried a raven walking toward me over the grass, with\r\nsolemn gait, and utter disregard of the falling deluge. Suspecting who\r\nhe was, I congratulated myself that I was safe on the ground-floor. At\r\nthe same time I had a conviction that, if I were not careful, something\r\nwould happen.\r\n\r\nHe came nearer and nearer, made a profound bow, and with a sudden winged\r\nleap stood on the window-sill. Then he stepped over the ledge, jumped\r\ndown into the room, and walked to the door. I thought he was on his way\r\nto the library, and followed him, determined, if he went up the stair,\r\nnot to take one step after him. He turned, however, neither toward the\r\nlibrary nor the stair, but to a little door that gave upon a grass-patch\r\nin a nook between two portions of the rambling old house. I made haste\r\nto open it for him. He stepped out into its creeper-covered porch, and\r\nstood looking at the rain, which fell like a huge thin cataract; I stood\r\nin the door behind him. The second flash came, and was followed by a\r\nlengthened roll of more distant thunder. He turned his head over his\r\nshoulder and looked at me, as much as to say, "You hear that?" then\r\nswivelled it round again, and anew contemplated the weather, apparently\r\nwith approbation. So human were his pose and carriage and the way he\r\nkept turning his head, that I remarked almost involuntarily,\r\n\r\n"Fine weather for the worms, Mr. Raven!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered, in the rather croaky voice I had learned to know,\r\n"the ground will be nice for them to get out and in!--It must be a\r\ngrand time on the steppes of Uranus!" he added, with a glance upward; "I\r\nbelieve it is raining there too; it was, all the last week!"\r\n\r\n"Why should that make it a grand time?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Because the animals there are all burrowers," he answered, "--like the\r\nfield-mice and the moles here.--They will be, for ages to come."\r\n\r\n"How do you know that, if I may be so bold?" I rejoined.\r\n\r\n"As any one would who had been there to see," he replied. "It is a great\r\nsight, until you get used to it, when the earth gives a heave, and\r\nout comes a beast. You might think it a hairy elephant or a\r\ndeinotherium--but none of the animals are the same as we have ever\r\nhad here. I was almost frightened myself the first time I saw the\r\ndry-bog-serpent come wallowing out--such a head and mane! and SUCH\r\neyes!--but the shower is nearly over. It will stop directly after the\r\nnext thunder-clap. There it is!"\r\n\r\nA flash came with the words, and in about half a minute the thunder.\r\nThen the rain ceased.\r\n\r\n"Now we should be going!" said the raven, and stepped to the front of\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\n"Going where?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Going where we have to go," he answered. "You did not surely think you\r\nhad got home? I told you there was no going out and in at pleasure until\r\nyou were at home!"\r\n\r\n"I do not want to go," I said.\r\n\r\n"That does not make any difference--at least not much," he answered.\r\n"This is the way!"\r\n\r\n"I am quite content where I am."\r\n\r\n"You think so, but you are not. Come along."\r\n\r\nHe hopped from the porch onto the grass, and turned, waiting.\r\n\r\n"I will not leave the house to-day," I said with obstinacy.\r\n\r\n"You will come into the garden!" rejoined the raven.\r\n\r\n"I give in so far," I replied, and stepped from the porch.\r\n\r\nThe sun broke through the clouds, and the raindrops flashed and sparkled\r\non the grass. The raven was walking over it.\r\n\r\n"You will wet your feet!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"And mire my beak," he answered, immediately plunging it deep in the\r\nsod, and drawing out a great wriggling red worm. He threw back his head,\r\nand tossed it in the air. It spread great wings, gorgeous in red and\r\nblack, and soared aloft.\r\n\r\n"Tut! tut!" I exclaimed; "you mistake, Mr. Raven: worms are not the\r\nlarvae of butterflies!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," he croaked; "it will do for once! I\'m not a reading man\r\nat present, but sexton at the--at a certain graveyard--cemetery, more\r\nproperly--in--at--no matter where!"\r\n\r\n"I see! you can\'t keep your spade still: and when you have nothing to\r\nbury, you must dig something up! Only you should mind what it is before\r\nyou make it fly! No creature should be allowed to forget what and where\r\nit came from!"\r\n\r\n"Why?" said the raven.\r\n\r\n"Because it will grow proud, and cease to recognise its superiors."\r\n\r\nNo man knows it when he is making an idiot of himself.\r\n\r\n"Where DO the worms come from?" said the raven, as if suddenly grown\r\ncurious to know.\r\n\r\n"Why, from the earth, as you have just seen!" I answered.\r\n\r\n"Yes, last!" he replied. "But they can\'t have come from it first--for\r\nthat will never go back to it!" he added, looking up.\r\n\r\nI looked up also, but could see nothing save a little dark cloud, the\r\nedges of which were red, as if with the light of the sunset.\r\n\r\n"Surely the sun is not going down!" I exclaimed, struck with amazement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" returned the raven. "That red belongs to the worm."\r\n\r\n"You see what comes of making creatures forget their origin!" I cried\r\nwith some warmth.\r\n\r\n"It is well, surely, if it be to rise higher and grow larger!" he\r\nreturned. "But indeed I only teach them to find it!"\r\n\r\n"Would you have the air full of worms?"\r\n\r\n"That is the business of a sexton. If only the rest of the clergy\r\nunderstood it as well!"\r\n\r\nIn went his beak again through the soft turf, and out came the wriggling\r\nworm. He tossed it in the air, and away it flew.\r\n\r\nI looked behind me, and gave a cry of dismay: I had but that moment\r\ndeclared I would not leave the house, and already I was a stranger in\r\nthe strange land!\r\n\r\n"What right have you to treat me so, Mr. Raven?" I said with deep\r\noffence. "Am I, or am I not, a free agent?"\r\n\r\n"A man is as free as he chooses to make himself, never an atom freer,"\r\nanswered the raven.\r\n\r\n"You have no right to make me do things against my will!"\r\n\r\n"When you have a will, you will find that no one can."\r\n\r\n"You wrong me in the very essence of my individuality!" I persisted.\r\n\r\n"If you were an individual I could not, therefore now I do not. You are\r\nbut beginning to become an individual."\r\n\r\nAll about me was a pine-forest, in which my eyes were already searching\r\ndeep, in the hope of discovering an unaccountable glimmer, and so\r\nfinding my way home. But, alas! how could I any longer call that house\r\nHOME, where every door, every window opened into OUT, and even the\r\ngarden I could not keep inside!\r\n\r\nI suppose I looked discomfited.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it may comfort you," said the raven, "to be told that you have\r\nnot yet left your house, neither has your house left you. At the same\r\ntime it cannot contain you, or you inhabit it!"\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you," I replied. "Where am I?"\r\n\r\n"In the region of the seven dimensions," he answered, with a curious\r\nnoise in his throat, and a flutter of his tail. "You had better follow\r\nme carefully now for a moment, lest you should hurt some one!"\r\n\r\n"There is nobody to hurt but yourself, Mr. Raven! I confess I should\r\nrather like to hurt you!"\r\n\r\n"That you see nobody is where the danger lies. But you see that large\r\ntree to your left, about thirty yards away?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do: why should I not?" I answered testily.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes ago you did not see it, and now you do not know where it\r\nstands!"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Where do you think it stands?"\r\n\r\n"Why THERE, where you know it is!"\r\n\r\n"Where is THERE?"\r\n\r\n"You bother me with your silly questions!" I cried. "I am growing tired\r\nof you!"\r\n\r\n"That tree stands on the hearth of your kitchen, and grows nearly\r\nstraight up its chimney," he said.\r\n\r\n"Now I KNOW you are making game of me!" I answered, with a laugh of\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n"Was I making game of you when you discovered me looking out of your\r\nstar-sapphire yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"That was this morning--not an hour ago!"\r\n\r\n"I have been widening your horizon longer than that, Mr. Vane; but never\r\nmind!"\r\n\r\n"You mean you have been making a fool of me!" I said, turning from him.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me: no one can do that but yourself!"\r\n\r\n"And I decline to do it."\r\n\r\n"You mistake."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"In declining to acknowledge yourself one already. You make yourself\r\nsuch by refusing what is true, and for that you will sorely punish\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"How, again?"\r\n\r\n"By believing what is not true."\r\n\r\n"Then, if I walk to the other side of that tree, I shall walk through\r\nthe kitchen fire?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. You would first, however, walk through the lady at the piano\r\nin the breakfast-room. That rosebush is close by her. You would give her\r\na terrible start!"\r\n\r\n"There is no lady in the house!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Is not your housekeeper a lady? She is counted such in a\r\ncertain country where all are servants, and the liveries one and\r\nmultitudinous!"\r\n\r\n"She cannot use the piano, anyhow!"\r\n\r\n"Her niece can: she is there--a well-educated girl and a capital\r\nmusician."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me; I cannot help it: you seem to me to be talking sheer\r\nnonsense!"\r\n\r\n"If you could but hear the music! Those great long heads of wild\r\nhyacinth are inside the piano, among the strings of it, and give that\r\npeculiar sweetness to her playing!--Pardon me: I forgot your deafness!"\r\n\r\n"Two objects," I said, "cannot exist in the same place at the same\r\ntime!"\r\n\r\n"Can they not? I did not know!--I remember now they do teach that with\r\nyou. It is a great mistake--one of the greatest ever wiseacre made! No\r\nman of the universe, only a man of the world could have said so!"\r\n\r\n"You a librarian, and talk such rubbish!" I cried. "Plainly, you did not\r\nread many of the books in your charge!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! I went through all in your library--at the time, and came out\r\nat the other side not much the wiser. I was a bookworm then, but when I\r\ncame to know it, I woke among the butterflies. To be sure I have given\r\nup reading for a good many years--ever since I was made sexton.--There!\r\nI smell Grieg\'s Wedding March in the quiver of those rose-petals!"\r\n\r\nI went to the rose-bush and listened hard, but could not hear the\r\nthinnest ghost of a sound; I only smelt something I had never before\r\nsmelt in any rose. It was still rose-odour, but with a difference,\r\ncaused, I suppose, by the Wedding March.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked up, there was the bird by my side.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Raven," I said, "forgive me for being so rude: I was irritated.\r\nWill you kindly show me my way home? I must go, for I have an\r\nappointment with my bailiff. One must not break faith with his\r\nservants!"\r\n\r\n"You cannot break what was broken days ago!" he answered.\r\n\r\n"Do show me the way," I pleaded.\r\n\r\n"I cannot," he returned. "To go back, you must go through yourself, and\r\nthat way no man can show another."\r\n\r\nEntreaty was vain. I must accept my fate! But how was life to be lived\r\nin a world of which I had all the laws to learn? There would, however,\r\nbe adventure! that held consolation; and whether I found my way home or\r\nnot, I should at least have the rare advantage of knowing two worlds!\r\n\r\nI had never yet done anything to justify my existence; my former world\r\nwas nothing the better for my sojourn in it: here, however, I must earn,\r\nor in some way find, my bread! But I reasoned that, as I was not to\r\nblame in being here, I might expect to be taken care of here as well as\r\nthere! I had had nothing to do with getting into the world I had just\r\nleft, and in it I had found myself heir to a large property! If that\r\nworld, as I now saw, had a claim upon me because I had eaten, and could\r\neat again, upon this world I had a claim because I must eat--when it\r\nwould in return have a claim on me!\r\n\r\n"There is no hurry," said the raven, who stood regarding me; "we do not\r\ngo much by the clock here. Still, the sooner one begins to do what has\r\nto be done, the better! I will take you to my wife."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Let us go!" I answered, and immediately he led the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE OLD CHURCH\r\n\r\nI followed him deep into the pine-forest. Neither of us said much while\r\nyet the sacred gloom of it closed us round. We came to larger and yet\r\nlarger trees--older, and more individual, some of them grotesque with\r\nage. Then the forest grew thinner.\r\n\r\n"You see that hawthorn?" said my guide at length, pointing with his\r\nbeak.\r\n\r\nI looked where the wood melted away on the edge of an open heath.\r\n\r\n"I see a gnarled old man, with a great white head," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Look again," he rejoined: "it is a hawthorn."\r\n\r\n"It seems indeed an ancient hawthorn; but this is not the season for the\r\nhawthorn to blossom!" I objected.\r\n\r\n"The season for the hawthorn to blossom," he replied, "is when the\r\nhawthorn blossoms. That tree is in the ruins of the church on your\r\nhome-farm. You were going to give some directions to the bailiff about\r\nits churchyard, were you not, the morning of the thunder?"\r\n\r\n"I was going to tell him I wanted it turned into a wilderness of\r\nrose-trees, and that the plough must never come within three yards of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said the raven, seeming to hold his breath.\r\n\r\nI listened, and heard--was it the sighing of a far-off musical wind--or\r\nthe ghost of a music that had once been glad? Or did I indeed hear\r\nanything?\r\n\r\n"They go there still," said the raven.\r\n\r\n"Who goes there? and where do they go?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Some of the people who used to pray there, go to the ruins still," he\r\nreplied. "But they will not go much longer, I think."\r\n\r\n"What makes them go now?"\r\n\r\n"They need help from each other to get their thinking done, and their\r\nfeelings hatched, so they talk and sing together; and then, they say,\r\nthe big thought floats out of their hearts like a great ship out of the\r\nriver at high water."\r\n\r\n"Do they pray as well as sing?"\r\n\r\n"No; they have found that each can best pray in his own silent\r\nheart.--Some people are always at their prayers.--Look! look! There goes\r\none!"\r\n\r\nHe pointed right up into the air. A snow-white pigeon was mounting, with\r\nquick and yet quicker wing-flap, the unseen spiral of an ethereal stair.\r\nThe sunshine flashed quivering from its wings.\r\n\r\n"I see a pigeon!" I said.\r\n\r\n"Of course you see a pigeon," rejoined the raven, "for there is the\r\npigeon! I see a prayer on its way.--I wonder now what heart is that\r\ndove\'s mother! Some one may have come awake in my cemetery!"\r\n\r\n"How can a pigeon be a prayer?" I said. "I understand, of course, how\r\nit should be a fit symbol or likeness for one; but a live pigeon to come\r\nout of a heart!"\r\n\r\n"It MUST puzzle you! It cannot fail to do so!"\r\n\r\n"A prayer is a thought, a thing spiritual!" I pursued.\r\n\r\n"Very true! But if you understood any world besides your own, you would\r\nunderstand your own much better.--When a heart is really alive, then it\r\nis able to think live things. There is one heart all whose thoughts\r\nare strong, happy creatures, and whose very dreams are lives. When some\r\npray, they lift heavy thoughts from the ground, only to drop them on it\r\nagain; others send up their prayers in living shapes, this or that, the\r\nnearest likeness to each. All live things were thoughts to begin with,\r\nand are fit therefore to be used by those that think. When one says to\r\nthe great Thinker:--\'Here is one of thy thoughts: I am thinking it now!\'\r\nthat is a prayer--a word to the big heart from one of its own little\r\nhearts.--Look, there is another!"\r\n\r\nThis time the raven pointed his beak downward--to something at the foot\r\nof a block of granite. I looked, and saw a little flower. I had never\r\nseen one like it before, and cannot utter the feeling it woke in me by\r\nits gracious, trusting form, its colour, and its odour as of a new world\r\nthat was yet the old. I can only say that it suggested an anemone, was\r\nof a pale rose-hue, and had a golden heart.\r\n\r\n"That is a prayer-flower," said the raven.\r\n\r\n"I never saw such a flower before!" I rejoined.\r\n\r\n"There is no other such. Not one prayer-flower is ever quite like\r\nanother," he returned.\r\n\r\n"How do you know it a prayer-flower?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"By the expression of it," he answered. "More than that I cannot tell\r\nyou. If you know it, you know it; if you do not, you do not."\r\n\r\n"Could you not teach me to know a prayer-flower when I see it?" I said.\r\n\r\n"I could not. But if I could, what better would you be? you would not\r\nknow it of YOURSELF and ITself! Why know the name of a thing when the\r\nthing itself you do not know? Whose work is it but your own to open your\r\neyes? But indeed the business of the universe is to make such a fool of\r\nyou that you will know yourself for one, and so begin to be wise!"\r\n\r\nBut I did see that the flower was different from any flower I had ever\r\nseen before; therefore I knew that I must be seeing a shadow of the\r\nprayer in it; and a great awe came over me to think of the heart\r\nlistening to the flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE SEXTON\'S COTTAGE\r\n\r\nWe had been for some time walking over a rocky moorland covered with\r\ndry plants and mosses, when I descried a little cottage in the farthest\r\ndistance. The sun was not yet down, but he was wrapt in a gray cloud.\r\nThe heath looked as if it had never been warm, and the wind blew\r\nstrangely cold, as if from some region where it was always night.\r\n\r\n"Here we are at last!" said the raven. "What a long way it is! In half\r\nthe time I could have gone to Paradise and seen my cousin--him, you\r\nremember, who never came back to Noah! Dear! dear! it is almost winter!"\r\n\r\n"Winter!" I cried; "it seems but half a day since we left home!"\r\n\r\n"That is because we have travelled so fast," answered the raven. "In\r\nyour world you cannot pull up the plumb-line you call gravitation, and\r\nlet the world spin round under your feet! But here is my wife\'s house!\r\nShe is very good to let me live with her, and call it the sexton\'s\r\ncottage!"\r\n\r\n"But where is your churchyard--your cemetery--where you make your\r\ngraves, I mean?" said I, seeing nothing but the flat heath.\r\n\r\nThe raven stretched his neck, held out his beak horizontally, turned it\r\nslowly round to all the points of the compass, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nI followed the beak with my eyes, and lo, without church or graves, all\r\nwas a churchyard! Wherever the dreary wind swept, there was the raven\'s\r\ncemetery! He was sexton of all he surveyed! lord of all that was laid\r\naside! I stood in the burial-ground of the universe; its compass the\r\nunenclosed heath, its wall the gray horizon, low and starless! I had\r\nleft spring and summer, autumn and sunshine behind me, and come to the\r\nwinter that waited for me! I had set out in the prime of my youth, and\r\nhere I was already!--But I mistook. The day might well be long in that\r\nregion, for it contained the seasons. Winter slept there, the night\r\nthrough, in his winding-sheet of ice; with childlike smile, Spring came\r\nawake in the dawn; at noon, Summer blazed abroad in her gorgeous beauty;\r\nwith the slow-changing afternoon, old Autumn crept in, and died at the\r\nfirst breath of the vaporous, ghosty night.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the cottage, the clouded sun was rushing down the\r\nsteepest slope of the west, and he sank while we were yet a few yards\r\nfrom the door. The same instant I was assailed by a cold that seemed\r\nalmost a material presence, and I struggled across the threshold as if\r\nfrom the clutches of an icy death. A wind swelled up on the moor, and\r\nrushed at the door as with difficulty I closed it behind me. Then all\r\nwas still, and I looked about me.\r\n\r\nA candle burned on a deal table in the middle of the room, and the first\r\nthing I saw was the lid of a coffin, as I thought, set up against the\r\nwall; but it opened, for it was a door, and a woman entered. She was all\r\nin white--as white as new-fallen snow; and her face was as white as her\r\ndress, but not like snow, for at once it suggested warmth. I thought her\r\nfeatures were perfect, but her eyes made me forget them. The life of\r\nher face and her whole person was gathered and concentrated in her eyes,\r\nwhere it became light. It might have been coming death that made her\r\nface luminous, but the eyes had life in them for a nation--large, and\r\ndark with a darkness ever deepening as I gazed. A whole night-heaven\r\nlay condensed in each pupil; all the stars were in its blackness, and\r\nflashed; while round it for a horizon lay coiled an iris of the eternal\r\ntwilight. What any eye IS, God only knows: her eyes must have been\r\ncoming direct out of his own! the still face might be a primeval\r\nperfection; the live eyes were a continuous creation.\r\n\r\n"Here is Mr. Vane, wife!" said the raven.\r\n\r\n"He is welcome," she answered, in a low, rich, gentle voice. Treasures\r\nof immortal sound seemed to be buried in it.\r\n\r\nI gazed, and could not speak.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would be glad to see him!" added the raven.\r\n\r\nShe stood in front of the door by which she had entered, and did not\r\ncome nearer.\r\n\r\n"Will he sleep?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I fear not," he replied; "he is neither weary nor heavy laden."\r\n\r\n"Why then have you brought him?"\r\n\r\n"I have my fears it may prove precipitate."\r\n\r\n"I do not quite understand you," I said, with an uneasy foreboding as to\r\nwhat she meant, but a vague hope of some escape. "Surely a man must do a\r\nday\'s work first!"\r\n\r\nI gazed into the white face of the woman, and my heart fluttered. She\r\nreturned my gaze in silence.\r\n\r\n"Let me first go home," I resumed, "and come again after I have found or\r\nmade, invented, or at least discovered something!"\r\n\r\n"He has not yet learned that the day begins with sleep!" said the\r\nwoman, turning to her husband. "Tell him he must rest before he can do\r\nanything!"\r\n\r\n"Men," he answered, "think so much of having done, that they fall asleep\r\nupon it. They cannot empty an egg but they turn into the shell, and lie\r\ndown!"\r\n\r\nThe words drew my eyes from the woman to the raven.\r\n\r\nI saw no raven, but the librarian--the same slender elderly man, in a\r\nrusty black coat, large in the body and long in the tails. I had seen\r\nonly his back before; now for the first time I saw his face. It was\r\nso thin that it showed the shape of the bones under it, suggesting the\r\nskulls his last-claimed profession must have made him familiar with. But\r\nin truth I had never before seen a face so alive, or a look so keen or\r\nso friendly as that in his pale blue eyes, which yet had a haze about\r\nthem as if they had done much weeping.\r\n\r\n"You knew I was not a raven!" he said with a smile.\r\n\r\n"I knew you were Mr. Raven," I replied; "but somehow I thought you a\r\nbird too!"\r\n\r\n"What made you think me a bird?"\r\n\r\n"You looked a raven, and I saw you dig worms out of the earth with your\r\nbeak."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Toss them in the air." "And then?"\r\n\r\n"They grew butterflies, and flew away."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see a raven do that? I told you I was a sexton!"\r\n\r\n"Does a sexton toss worms in the air, and turn them into butterflies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I never saw one do it!"\r\n\r\n"You saw me do it!--But I am still librarian in your house, for I never\r\nwas dismissed, and never gave up the office. Now I am librarian here as\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"But you have just told me you were sexton here!"\r\n\r\n"So I am. It is much the same profession. Except you are a true sexton,\r\nbooks are but dead bodies to you, and a library nothing but a catacomb!"\r\n\r\n"You bewilder me!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right!"\r\n\r\nA few moments he stood silent. The woman, moveless as a statue, stood\r\nsilent also by the coffin-door.\r\n\r\n"Upon occasion," said the sexton at length, "it is more convenient to\r\nput one\'s bird-self in front. Every one, as you ought to know, has a\r\nbeast-self--and a bird-self, and a stupid fish-self, ay, and a creeping\r\nserpent-self too--which it takes a deal of crushing to kill! In truth\r\nhe has also a tree-self and a crystal-self, and I don\'t know how many\r\nselves more--all to get into harmony. You can tell what sort a man is by\r\nhis creature that comes oftenest to the front."\r\n\r\nHe turned to his wife, and I considered him more closely. He was above\r\nthe ordinary height, and stood more erect than when last I saw him. His\r\nface was, like his wife\'s, very pale; its nose handsomely encased the\r\nbeak that had retired within it; its lips were very thin, and even they\r\nhad no colour, but their curves were beautiful, and about them quivered\r\na shadowy smile that had humour in it as well as love and pity.\r\n\r\n"We are in want of something to eat and drink, wife," he said; "we have\r\ncome a long way!"\r\n\r\n"You know, husband," she answered, "we can give only to him that asks."\r\n\r\nShe turned her unchanging face and radiant eyes upon mine.\r\n\r\n"Please give me something to eat, Mrs. Raven," I said, "and\r\nsomething--what you will--to quench my thirst."\r\n\r\n"Your thirst must be greater before you can have what will quench it,"\r\nshe replied; "but what I can give you, I will gladly."\r\n\r\nShe went to a cupboard in the wall, brought from it bread and wine, and\r\nset them on the table.\r\n\r\nWe sat down to the perfect meal; and as I ate, the bread and wine\r\nseemed to go deeper than the hunger and thirst. Anxiety and discomfort\r\nvanished; expectation took their place.\r\n\r\nI grew very sleepy, and now first felt weary.\r\n\r\n"I have earned neither food nor sleep, Mrs. Raven," I said, "but you\r\nhave given me the one freely, and now I hope you will give me the other,\r\nfor I sorely need it."\r\n\r\n"Sleep is too fine a thing ever to be earned," said the sexton; "it must\r\nbe given and accepted, for it is a necessity. But it would be perilous\r\nto use this house as a half-way hostelry--for the repose of a night,\r\nthat is, merely."\r\n\r\nA wild-looking little black cat jumped on his knee as he spoke. He\r\npatted it as one pats a child to make it go to sleep: he seemed to me\r\npatting down the sod upon a grave--patting it lovingly, with an inward\r\nlullaby.\r\n\r\n"Here is one of Mara\'s kittens!" he said to his wife: "will you give it\r\nsomething and put it out? she may want it!"\r\n\r\nThe woman took it from him gently, gave it a little piece of bread, and\r\nwent out with it, closing the door behind her.\r\n\r\n"How then am I to make use of your hospitality?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"By accepting it to the full," he answered.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand."\r\n\r\n"In this house no one wakes of himself."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because no one anywhere ever wakes of himself. You can wake yourself no\r\nmore than you can make yourself."\r\n\r\n"Then perhaps you or Mrs. Raven would kindly call me!" I said, still\r\nnowise understanding, but feeling afresh that vague foreboding.\r\n\r\n"We cannot."\r\n\r\n"How dare I then go to sleep?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"If you would have the rest of this house, you must not trouble yourself\r\nabout waking. You must go to sleep heartily, altogether and outright."\r\nMy soul sank within me.\r\n\r\nThe sexton sat looking me in the face. His eyes seemed to say, "Will you\r\nnot trust me?" I returned his gaze, and answered,\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\n"Then come," he said; "I will show you your couch."\r\n\r\nAs we rose, the woman came in. She took up the candle, turned to the\r\ninner door, and led the way. I went close behind her, and the sexton\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE CEMETERY\r\n\r\nThe air as of an ice-house met me crossing the threshold. The door\r\nfell-to behind us. The sexton said something to his wife that made her\r\nturn toward us.--What a change had passed upon her! It was as if the\r\nsplendour of her eyes had grown too much for them to hold, and, sinking\r\ninto her countenance, made it flash with a loveliness like that of\r\nBeatrice in the white rose of the redeemed. Life itself, life eternal,\r\nimmortal, streamed from it, an unbroken lightning. Even her hands\r\nshone with a white radiance, every "pearl-shell helmet" gleaming like\r\na moonstone. Her beauty was overpowering; I was glad when she turned it\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\nBut the light of the candle reached such a little way, that at first I\r\ncould see nothing of the place. Presently, however, it fell on something\r\nthat glimmered, a little raised from the floor. Was it a bed? Could\r\nlive thing sleep in such a mortal cold? Then surely it was no wonder\r\nit should not wake of itself! Beyond that appeared a fainter shine; and\r\nthen I thought I descried uncertain gleams on every side.\r\n\r\nA few paces brought us to the first; it was a human form under a sheet,\r\nstraight and still--whether of man or woman I could not tell, for the\r\nlight seemed to avoid the face as we passed.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that we were walking along an aisle of couches, on\r\nalmost every one of which, with its head to the passage, lay something\r\nasleep or dead, covered with a sheet white as snow. My soul grew\r\nsilent with dread. Through aisle after aisle we went, among couches\r\ninnumerable. I could see only a few of them at once, but they were on\r\nall sides, vanishing, as it seemed, in the infinite.--Was it here lay my\r\nchoice of a bed? Must I go to sleep among the unwaking, with no one to\r\nrouse me? Was this the sexton\'s library? were these his books? Truly it\r\nwas no half-way house, this chamber of the dead!\r\n\r\n"One of the cellars I am placed to watch!" remarked Mr. Raven--in a low\r\nvoice, as if fearing to disturb his silent guests. "Much wine is set\r\nhere to ripen!--But it is dark for a stranger!" he added.\r\n\r\n"The moon is rising; she will soon be here," said his wife, and her\r\nclear voice, low and sweet, sounded of ancient sorrow long bidden adieu.\r\n\r\nEven as she spoke the moon looked in at an opening in the wall, and a\r\nthousand gleams of white responded to her shine. But not yet could I\r\ndescry beginning or end of the couches. They stretched away and away, as\r\nif for all the disparted world to sleep upon. For along the far receding\r\nnarrow ways, every couch stood by itself, and on each slept a lonely\r\nsleeper. I thought at first their sleep was death, but I soon saw it was\r\nsomething deeper still--a something I did not know.\r\n\r\nThe moon rose higher, and shone through other openings, but I could\r\nnever see enough of the place at once to know its shape or character;\r\nnow it would resemble a long cathedral nave, now a huge barn made into\r\na dwelling of tombs. She looked colder than any moon in the frostiest\r\nnight of the world, and where she shone direct upon them, cast a bluish,\r\nicy gleam on the white sheets and the pallid countenances--but it might\r\nbe the faces that made the moon so cold!\r\n\r\nOf such as I could see, all were alike in the brotherhood of death, all\r\nunlike in the character and history recorded upon them. Here lay a man\r\nwho had died--for although this was not death, I have no other name to\r\ngive it--in the prime of manly strength; his dark beard seemed to flow\r\nlike a liberated stream from the glacier of his frozen countenance; his\r\nforehead was smooth as polished marble; a shadow of pain lingered about\r\nhis lips, but only a shadow. On the next couch lay the form of a girl,\r\npassing lovely to behold. The sadness left on her face by parting was\r\nnot yet absorbed in perfect peace, but absolute submission possessed the\r\nplacid features, which bore no sign of wasting disease, of "killing care\r\nor grief of heart": if pain had been there, it was long charmed asleep,\r\nnever again to wake. Many were the beautiful that there lay very\r\nstill--some of them mere children; but I did not see one infant. The\r\nmost beautiful of all was a lady whose white hair, and that alone,\r\nsuggested her old when first she fell asleep. On her stately countenance\r\nrested--not submission, but a right noble acquiescence, an assurance,\r\nfirm as the foundations of the universe, that all was as it should\r\nbe. On some faces lingered the almost obliterated scars of strife, the\r\nmarrings of hopeless loss, the fading shadows of sorrows that had seemed\r\ninconsolable: the aurora of the great morning had not yet quite melted\r\nthem away; but those faces were few, and every one that bore such brand\r\nof pain seemed to plead, "Pardon me: I died only yesterday!" or, "Pardon\r\nme: I died but a century ago!" That some had been dead for ages I knew,\r\nnot merely by their unutterable repose, but by something for which I\r\nhave neither word nor symbol.\r\n\r\nWe came at last to three empty couches, immediately beyond which lay the\r\nform of a beautiful woman, a little past the prime of life. One of her\r\narms was outside the sheet, and her hand lay with the palm upward, in\r\nits centre a dark spot. Next to her was the stalwart figure of a man of\r\nmiddle age. His arm too was outside the sheet, the strong hand almost\r\nclosed, as if clenched on the grip of a sword. I thought he must be a\r\nking who had died fighting for the truth.\r\n\r\n"Will you hold the candle nearer, wife?" whispered the sexton, bending\r\ndown to examine the woman\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"It heals well," he murmured to himself: "the nail found in her nothing\r\nto hurt!"\r\n\r\nAt last I ventured to speak.\r\n\r\n"Are they not dead?" I asked softly.\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer you," he replied in a subdued voice. "I almost forget\r\nwhat they mean by DEAD in the old world. If I said a person was dead, my\r\nwife would understand one thing, and you would imagine another.--This is\r\nbut one of my treasure vaults," he went on, "and all my guests are not\r\nlaid in vaults: out there on the moor they lie thick as the leaves of a\r\nforest after the first blast of your winter--thick, let me say rather,\r\nas if the great white rose of heaven had shed its petals over it. All\r\nnight the moon reads their faces, and smiles."\r\n\r\n"But why leave them in the corrupting moonlight?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Our moon," he answered, "is not like yours--the old cinder of a\r\nburnt-out world; her beams embalm the dead, not corrupt them. You\r\nobserve that here the sexton lays his dead on the earth; he buries very\r\nfew under it! In your world he lays huge stones on them, as if to keep\r\nthem down; I watch for the hour to ring the resurrection-bell, and wake\r\nthose that are still asleep. Your sexton looks at the clock to know when\r\nto ring the dead-alive to church; I hearken for the cock on the spire to\r\ncrow; \'AWAKE, THOU THAT SLEEPEST, AND ARISE FROM THE DEAD!\'"\r\n\r\nI began to conclude that the self-styled sexton was in truth an insane\r\nparson: the whole thing was too mad! But how was I to get away from it?\r\nI was helpless! In this world of the dead, the raven and his wife were\r\nthe only living I had yet seen: whither should I turn for help? I was\r\nlost in a space larger than imagination; for if here two things, or\r\nany parts of them, could occupy the same space, why not twenty or ten\r\nthousand?--But I dared not think further in that direction.\r\n\r\n"You seem in your dead to see differences beyond my perception!" I\r\nventured to remark.\r\n\r\n"None of those you see," he answered, "are in truth quite dead yet, and\r\nsome have but just begun to come alive and die. Others had begun to die,\r\nthat is to come alive, long before they came to us; and when such are\r\nindeed dead, that instant they will wake and leave us. Almost every\r\nnight some rise and go. But I will not say more, for I find my words\r\nonly mislead you!--This is the couch that has been waiting for you," he\r\nended, pointing to one of the three.\r\n\r\n"Why just this?" I said, beginning to tremble, and anxious by parley to\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n"For reasons which one day you will be glad to know," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Why not know them now?"\r\n\r\n"That also you will know when you wake."\r\n\r\n"But these are all dead, and I am alive!" I objected, shuddering.\r\n\r\n"Not much," rejoined the sexton with a smile, "--not nearly enough!\r\nBlessed be the true life that the pauses between its throbs are not\r\ndeath!"\r\n\r\n"The place is too cold to let one sleep!" I said.\r\n\r\n"Do these find it so?" he returned. "They sleep well--or will soon. Of\r\ncold they feel not a breath: it heals their wounds.--Do not be a coward,\r\nMr. Vane. Turn your back on fear, and your face to whatever may come.\r\nGive yourself up to the night, and you will rest indeed. Harm will not\r\ncome to you, but a good you cannot foreknow."\r\n\r\nThe sexton and I stood by the side of the couch, his wife, with the\r\ncandle in her hand, at the foot of it. Her eyes were full of light, but\r\nher face was again of a still whiteness; it was no longer radiant.\r\n\r\n"Would they have me make of a charnel-house my bed-chamber?" I cried\r\naloud. "I will not. I will lie abroad on the heath; it cannot be colder\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\n"I have just told you that the dead are there also,\r\n\r\n     \'Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks\r\n      In Vallombrosa,\'"\r\n\r\nsaid the librarian.\r\n\r\n"I will NOT," I cried again; and in the compassing dark, the two gleamed\r\nout like spectres that waited on the dead; neither answered me; each\r\nstood still and sad, and looked at the other.\r\n\r\n"Be of good comfort; we watch the flock of the great shepherd," said the\r\nsexton to his wife.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to me.\r\n\r\n"Didst thou not find the air of the place pure and sweet when thou\r\nenteredst it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but oh, so cold!" I answered.\r\n\r\n"Then know," he returned, and his voice was stern, "that thou who\r\ncallest thyself alive, hast brought into this chamber the odours of\r\ndeath, and its air will not be wholesome for the sleepers until thou art\r\ngone from it!"\r\n\r\nThey went farther into the great chamber, and I was left alone in the\r\nmoonlight with the dead.\r\n\r\nI turned to escape.\r\n\r\nWhat a long way I found it back through the dead! At first I was too\r\nangry to be afraid, but as I grew calm, the still shapes grew terrible.\r\nAt last, with loud offence to the gracious silence, I ran, I fled\r\nwildly, and, bursting out, flung-to the door behind me. It closed with\r\nan awful silence.\r\n\r\nI stood in pitch-darkness. Feeling about me, I found a door, opened it,\r\nand was aware of the dim light of a lamp. I stood in my library, with\r\nthe handle of the masked door in my hand.\r\n\r\nHad I come to myself out of a vision?--or lost myself by going back to\r\none? Which was the real--what I now saw, or what I had just ceased to\r\nsee? Could both be real, interpenetrating yet unmingling?\r\n\r\nI threw myself on a couch, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the library was one small window to the east, through which, at this\r\ntime of the year, the first rays of the sun shone upon a mirror whence\r\nthey were reflected on the masked door: when I woke, there they shone,\r\nand thither they drew my eyes. With the feeling that behind it must lie\r\nthe boundless chamber I had left by that door, I sprang to my feet,\r\nand opened it. The light, like an eager hound, shot before me into the\r\ncloset, and pounced upon the gilded edges of a large book.\r\n\r\n"What idiot," I cried, "has put that book in the shelf the wrong way?"\r\n\r\nBut the gilded edges, reflecting the light a second time, flung it on\r\na nest of drawers in a dark corner, and I saw that one of them was half\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n"More meddling!" I cried, and went to close the drawer.\r\n\r\nIt contained old papers, and seemed more than full, for it would\r\nnot close. Taking the topmost one out, I perceived that it was in my\r\nfather\'s writing and of some length. The words on which first my eyes\r\nfell, at once made me eager to learn what it contained. I carried it\r\nto the library, sat down in one of the western windows, and read what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. MY FATHER\'S MANUSCRIPT\r\n\r\nI am filled with awe of what I have to write. The sun is shining golden\r\nabove me; the sea lies blue beneath his gaze; the same world sends its\r\ngrowing things up to the sun, and its flying things into the air which\r\nI have breathed from my infancy; but I know the outspread splendour a\r\npassing show, and that at any moment it may, like the drop-scene of a\r\nstage, be lifted to reveal more wonderful things.\r\n\r\nShortly after my father\'s death, I was seated one morning in the\r\nlibrary. I had been, somewhat listlessly, regarding the portrait that\r\nhangs among the books, which I knew only as that of a distant ancestor,\r\nand wishing I could learn something of its original. Then I had taken a\r\nbook from the shelves and begun to read.\r\n\r\nGlancing up from it, I saw coming toward me--not between me and the\r\ndoor, but between me and the portrait--a thin pale man in rusty black.\r\nHe looked sharp and eager, and had a notable nose, at once reminding me\r\nof a certain jug my sisters used to call Mr. Crow.\r\n\r\n"Finding myself in your vicinity, Mr. Vane, I have given myself the\r\npleasure of calling," he said, in a peculiar but not disagreeable\r\nvoice. "Your honoured grandfather treated me--I may say it without\r\npresumption--as a friend, having known me from childhood as his father\'s\r\nlibrarian."\r\n\r\nIt did not strike me at the time how old the man must be.\r\n\r\n"May I ask where you live now, Mr. Crow?" I said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled an amused smile.\r\n\r\n"You nearly hit my name," he rejoined, "which shows the family insight.\r\nYou have seen me before, but only once, and could not then have heard\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Where was that?"\r\n\r\n"In this very room. You were quite a child, however!"\r\n\r\nI could not be sure that I remembered him, but for a moment I fancied I\r\ndid, and I begged him to set me right as to his name.\r\n\r\n"There is such a thing as remembering without recognising the memory in\r\nit," he remarked. "For my name--which you have near enough--it used to\r\nbe Raven."\r\n\r\nI had heard the name, for marvellous tales had brought it me.\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of you to come and see me," I said. "Will you not sit\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\nHe seated himself at once.\r\n\r\n"You knew my father, then, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"I knew him," he answered with a curious smile, "but he did not care\r\nabout my acquaintance, and we never met.--That gentleman, however," he\r\nadded, pointing to the portrait,--"old Sir Up\'ard, his people called\r\nhim,--was in his day a friend of mine yet more intimate than ever your\r\ngrandfather became."\r\n\r\nThen at length I began to think the interview a strange one. But in\r\ntruth it was hardly stranger that my visitor should remember Sir Upward,\r\nthan that he should have been my great-grandfather\'s librarian!\r\n\r\n"I owe him much," he continued; "for, although I had read many more\r\nbooks than he, yet, through the special direction of his studies, he was\r\nable to inform me of a certain relation of modes which I should never\r\nhave discovered of myself, and could hardly have learned from any one\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind telling me all about that?" I said.\r\n\r\n"By no means--as much at least as I am able: there are not such things\r\nas wilful secrets," he answered--and went on.\r\n\r\n"That closet held his library--a hundred manuscripts or so, for printing\r\nwas not then invented. One morning I sat there, working at a catalogue\r\nof them, when he looked in at the door, and said, \'Come.\' I laid down my\r\npen and followed him--across the great hall, down a steep rough descent,\r\nand along an underground passage to a tower he had lately built,\r\nconsisting of a stair and a room at the top of it. The door of this room\r\nhad a tremendous lock, which he undid with the smallest key I ever saw.\r\nI had scarcely crossed the threshold after him, when, to my eyes, he\r\nbegan to dwindle, and grew less and less. All at once my vision seemed\r\nto come right, and I saw that he was moving swiftly away from me. In a\r\nminute more he was the merest speck in the distance, with the tops\r\nof blue mountains beyond him, clear against a sky of paler blue. I\r\nrecognised the country, for I had gone there and come again many a time,\r\nalthough I had never known this way to it.\r\n\r\n"Many years after, when the tower had long disappeared, I taught one of\r\nhis descendants what Sir Upward had taught me; and now and then to this\r\nday I use your house when I want to go the nearest way home. I must\r\nindeed--without your leave, for which I ask your pardon--have by this\r\ntime well established a right of way through it--not from front to back,\r\nbut from bottom to top!"\r\n\r\n"You would have me then understand, Mr. Raven," I said, "that you go\r\nthrough my house into another world, heedless of disparting space?"\r\n\r\n"That I go through it is an incontrovertible acknowledgement of space,"\r\nreturned the old librarian.\r\n\r\n"Please do not quibble, Mr. Raven," I rejoined. "Please to take my\r\nquestion as you know I mean it."\r\n\r\n"There is in your house a door, one step through which carries me into a\r\nworld very much another than this."\r\n\r\n"A better?"\r\n\r\n"Not throughout; but so much another that most of its physical, and many\r\nof its mental laws are different from those of this world. As for moral\r\nlaws, they must everywhere be fundamentally the same."\r\n\r\n"You try my power of belief!" I said.\r\n\r\n"You take me for a madman, probably?"\r\n\r\n"You do not look like one."\r\n\r\n"A liar then?"\r\n\r\n"You give me no ground to think you such."\r\n\r\n"Only you do not believe me?"\r\n\r\n"I will go out of that door with you if you like: I believe in you\r\nenough to risk the attempt."\r\n\r\n"The blunder all my children make!" he murmured. "The only door out is\r\nthe door in!"\r\n\r\nI began to think he must be crazy. He sat silent for a moment, his head\r\nresting on his hand, his elbow on the table, and his eyes on the books\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n"A book," he said louder, "is a door in, and therefore a door out.--I\r\nsee old Sir Up\'ard," he went on, closing his eyes, "and my heart swells\r\nwith love to him:--what world is he in?"\r\n\r\n"The world of your heart!" I replied; "--that is, the idea of him is\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"There is one world then at least on which your hall-door does not\r\nopen?"\r\n\r\n"I grant you so much; but the things in that world are not things to\r\nhave and to hold."\r\n\r\n"Think a little farther," he rejoined: "did anything ever become yours,\r\nexcept by getting into that world?--The thought is beyond you, however,\r\nat present!--I tell you there are more worlds, and more doors to them,\r\nthan you will think of in many years!"\r\n\r\nHe rose, left the library, crossed the hall, and went straight up to\r\nthe garret, familiar evidently with every turn. I followed, studying his\r\nback. His hair hung down long and dark, straight and glossy. His coat\r\nwas wide and reached to his heels. His shoes seemed too large for him.\r\n\r\nIn the garret a light came through at the edges of the great roofing\r\nslabs, and showed us parts where was no flooring, and we must step from\r\njoist to joist: in the middle of one of these spaces rose a partition,\r\nwith a door: through it I followed Mr. Raven into a small, obscure\r\nchamber, whose top contracted as it rose, and went slanting through the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n"That is the door I spoke of," he said, pointing to an oblong mirror\r\nthat stood on the floor and leaned against the wall. I went in front\r\nof it, and saw our figures dimly reflected in its dusty face. There\r\nwas something about it that made me uneasy. It looked old-fashioned and\r\nneglected, but, notwithstanding its ordinary seeming, the eagle, perched\r\nwith outstretched wings on the top, appeared threatful.\r\n\r\n"As a mirror," said the librarian, "it has grown dingy with age; but\r\nthat is no matter: its clearness depends on the light."\r\n\r\n"Light!" I rejoined; "there is no light here!"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer me, but began to pull at a little chain on the\r\nopposite wall. I heard a creaking: the top of the chamber was turning\r\nslowly round. He ceased pulling, looked at his watch, and began to pull\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"We arrive almost to the moment!" he said; "it is on the very stroke of\r\nnoon!"\r\n\r\nThe top went creaking and revolving for a minute or so. Then he pulled\r\ntwo other chains, now this, now that, and returned to the first. A\r\nmoment more and the chamber grew much clearer: a patch of sunlight had\r\nfallen upon a mirror on the wall opposite that against which the other\r\nleaned, and on the dust I saw the path of the reflected rays to the\r\nmirror on the ground. But from the latter none were returned; they\r\nseemed to go clean through; there was nowhere in the chamber a second\r\npatch of light!\r\n\r\n"Where are the sunrays gone?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"That I cannot tell," returned Mr. Raven; "--back, perhaps, to where\r\nthey came from first. They now belong, I fancy, to a sense not yet\r\ndeveloped in us."\r\n\r\nHe then talked of the relations of mind to matter, and of senses to\r\nqualities, in a way I could only a little understand, whence he went\r\non to yet stranger things which I could not at all comprehend. He spoke\r\nmuch about dimensions, telling me that there were many more than three,\r\nsome of them concerned with powers which were indeed in us, but of which\r\nas yet we knew absolutely nothing. His words, however, I confess, took\r\nlittle more hold of me than the light did of the mirror, for I thought\r\nhe hardly knew what he was saying.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was aware that our forms had gone from the mirror, which\r\nseemed full of a white mist. As I gazed I saw, growing gradually visible\r\nbeyond the mist, the tops of a range of mountains, which became clearer\r\nand clearer. Soon the mist vanished entirely, uncovering the face of a\r\nwide heath, on which, at some distance, was the figure of a man moving\r\nswiftly away. I turned to address my companion; he was no longer by my\r\nside. I looked again at the form in the mirror, and recognised the wide\r\ncoat flying, the black hair lifting in a wind that did not touch me. I\r\nrushed in terror from the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. I REPENT\r\n\r\nI laid the manuscript down, consoled to find that my father had had a\r\npeep into that mysterious world, and that he knew Mr. Raven.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that I had never heard the cause or any circumstance\r\nof my father\'s death, and began to believe that he must at last have\r\nfollowed Mr. Raven, and not come back; whereupon I speedily grew ashamed\r\nof my flight. What wondrous facts might I not by this time have gathered\r\nconcerning life and death, and wide regions beyond ordinary perception!\r\nAssuredly the Ravens were good people, and a night in their house would\r\nnowise have hurt me! They were doubtless strange, but it was faculty\r\nin which the one was peculiar, and beauty in which the other was\r\nmarvellous! And I had not believed in them! had treated them as unworthy\r\nof my confidence, as harbouring a design against me! The more I thought\r\nof my behaviour to them, the more disgusted I became with myself. Why\r\nshould I have feared such dead? To share their holy rest was an honour\r\nof which I had proved myself unworthy! What harm could that sleeping\r\nking, that lady with the wound in her palm, have done me? I fell a\r\nlonging after the sweet and stately stillness of their two countenances,\r\nand wept. Weeping I threw myself on a couch, and suddenly fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAs suddenly I woke, feeling as if some one had called me. The house was\r\nstill as an empty church. A blackbird was singing on the lawn. I said to\r\nmyself, "I will go and tell them I am ashamed, and will do whatever\r\nthey would have me do!" I rose, and went straight up the stairs to the\r\ngarret.\r\n\r\nThe wooden chamber was just as when first I saw it, the mirror dimly\r\nreflecting everything before it. It was nearly noon, and the sun would\r\nbe a little higher than when first I came: I must raise the hood a\r\nlittle, and adjust the mirrors accordingly! If I had but been in time to\r\nsee Mr. Raven do it!\r\n\r\nI pulled the chains, and let the light fall on the first mirror.\r\nI turned then to the other: there were the shapes of the former\r\nvision--distinguishable indeed, but tremulous like a landscape in a\r\npool ruffled by "a small pipling wind!" I touched the glass; it was\r\nimpermeable.\r\n\r\nSuspecting polarisation as the thing required, I shifted and shifted the\r\nmirrors, changing their relation, until at last, in a great degree, so\r\nfar as I was concerned, by chance, things came right between them, and\r\nI saw the mountains blue and steady and clear. I stepped forward, and my\r\nfeet were among the heather.\r\n\r\nAll I knew of the way to the cottage was that we had gone through a\r\npine-forest. I passed through many thickets and several small fir-woods,\r\ncontinually fancying afresh that I recognised something of the country;\r\nbut I had come upon no forest, and now the sun was near the horizon,\r\nand the air had begun to grow chill with the coming winter, when, to my\r\ndelight, I saw a little black object coming toward me: it was indeed the\r\nraven!\r\n\r\nI hastened to meet him.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, sir, for my rudeness last night," I said. "Will you\r\ntake me with you now? I heartily confess I do not deserve it."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he returned, and looked up. Then, after a brief pause, "My wife\r\ndoes not expect you to-night," he said. "She regrets that we at all\r\nencouraged your staying last week."\r\n\r\n"Take me to her that I may tell her how sorry I am," I begged humbly.\r\n\r\n"It is of no use," he answered. "Your night was not come then, or you\r\nwould not have left us. It is not come now, and I cannot show you the\r\nway. The dead were rejoicing under their daisies--they all lie among the\r\nroots of the flowers of heaven--at the thought of your delight when the\r\nwinter should be past, and the morning with its birds come: ere you\r\nleft them, they shivered in their beds. When the spring of the universe\r\narrives,--but that cannot be for ages yet! how many, I do not know--and\r\ndo not care to know."\r\n\r\n"Tell me one thing, I beg of you, Mr. Raven: is my father with you? Have\r\nyou seen him since he left the world?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is with us, fast asleep. That was he you saw with his arm on\r\nthe coverlet, his hand half closed."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me? That I should have been so near him, and not\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\n"And turn your back on him!" corrected the raven.\r\n\r\n"I would have lain down at once had I known!"\r\n\r\n"I doubt it. Had you been ready to lie down, you would have known\r\nhim!--Old Sir Up\'ard," he went on, "and your twice great-grandfather,\r\nboth are up and away long ago. Your great-grandfather has been with us\r\nfor many a year; I think he will soon begin to stir. You saw him last\r\nnight, though of course you did not know him."\r\n\r\n"Why OF COURSE?"\r\n\r\n"Because he is so much nearer waking than you. No one who will not sleep\r\ncan ever wake."\r\n\r\n"I do not at all understand you!"\r\n\r\n"You turned away, and would not understand!" I held my peace.--But if I\r\ndid not say something, he would go!\r\n\r\n"And my grandfather--is he also with you?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No; he is still in the Evil Wood, fighting the dead."\r\n\r\n"Where is the Evil Wood, that I may find him?"\r\n\r\n"You will not find him; but you will hardly miss the wood. It is the\r\nplace where those who will not sleep, wake up at night, to kill their\r\ndead and bury them."\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand you!"\r\n\r\n"Naturally not. Neither do I understand you; I can read neither your\r\nheart nor your face. When my wife and I do not understand our children,\r\nit is because there is not enough of them to be understood. God alone\r\ncan understand foolishness."\r\n\r\n"Then," I said, feeling naked and very worthless, "will you be so good\r\nas show me the nearest way home? There are more ways than one, I know,\r\nfor I have gone by two already."\r\n\r\n"There are indeed many ways."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, please, how to recognise the nearest."\r\n\r\n"I cannot," answered the raven; "you and I use the same words with\r\ndifferent meanings. We are often unable to tell people what they NEED to\r\nknow, because they WANT to know something else, and would therefore only\r\nmisunderstand what we said. Home is ever so far away in the palm of your\r\nhand, and how to get there it is of no use to tell you. But you will get\r\nthere; you must get there; you have to get there. Everybody who is not\r\nat home, has to go home. You thought you were at home where I found you:\r\nif that had been your home, you could not have left it. Nobody can leave\r\nhome. And nobody ever was or ever will be at home without having gone\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Enigma treading on enigma!" I exclaimed. "I did not come here to be\r\nasked riddles."\r\n\r\n"No; but you came, and found the riddles waiting for you! Indeed you\r\nare yourself the only riddle. What you call riddles are truths, and seem\r\nriddles because you are not true."\r\n\r\n"Worse and worse!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"And you MUST answer the riddles!" he continued. "They will go on asking\r\nthemselves until you understand yourself. The universe is a riddle\r\ntrying to get out, and you are holding your door hard against it."\r\n\r\n"Will you not in pity tell me what I am to do--where I must go?"\r\n\r\n"How should I tell YOUR to-do, or the way to it?"\r\n\r\n"If I am not to go home, at least direct me to some of my kind."\r\n\r\n"I do not know of any. The beings most like you are in that direction."\r\n\r\nHe pointed with his beak. I could see nothing but the setting sun, which\r\nblinded me.\r\n\r\n"Well," I said bitterly, "I cannot help feeling hardly treated--taken\r\nfrom my home, abandoned in a strange world, and refused instruction as\r\nto where I am to go or what I am to do!"\r\n\r\n"You forget," said the raven, "that, when I brought you and you declined\r\nmy hospitality, you reached what you call home in safety: now you are\r\ncome of yourself! Good night."\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked slowly away, with his beak toward the ground. I\r\nstood dazed. It was true I had come of myself, but had I not come with\r\nintent of atonement? My heart was sore, and in my brain was neither\r\nquest nor purpose, hope nor desire. I gazed after the raven, and would\r\nhave followed him, but felt it useless.\r\n\r\nAll at once he pounced on a spot, throwing the whole weight of his body\r\non his bill, and for some moments dug vigorously. Then with a flutter of\r\nhis wings he threw back his head, and something shot from his bill, cast\r\nhigh in the air. That moment the sun set, and the air at once grew very\r\ndusk, but the something opened into a soft radiance, and came pulsing\r\ntoward me like a fire-fly, but with a much larger and a yellower light.\r\nIt flew over my head. I turned and followed it.\r\n\r\nHere I interrupt my narrative to remark that it involves a constant\r\nstruggle to say what cannot be said with even an approach to precision,\r\nthe things recorded being, in their nature and in that of the creatures\r\nconcerned in them, so inexpressibly different from any possible events\r\nof this economy, that I can present them only by giving, in the forms\r\nand language of life in this world, the modes in which they affected\r\nme--not the things themselves, but the feelings they woke in me. Even\r\nthis much, however, I do with a continuous and abiding sense of\r\nfailure, finding it impossible to present more than one phase of a\r\nmultitudinously complicated significance, or one concentric sphere of a\r\ngraduated embodiment. A single thing would sometimes seem to be and mean\r\nmany things, with an uncertain identity at the heart of them, which kept\r\nconstantly altering their look. I am indeed often driven to set down\r\nwhat I know to be but a clumsy and doubtful representation of the mere\r\nfeeling aimed at, none of the communicating media of this world being\r\nfit to convey it, in its peculiar strangeness, with even an approach\r\nto clearness or certainty. Even to one who knew the region better than\r\nmyself, I should have no assurance of transmitting the reality of\r\nmy experience in it. While without a doubt, for instance, that I was\r\nactually regarding a scene of activity, I might be, at the same moment,\r\nin my consciousness aware that I was perusing a metaphysical argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE BAD BURROW\r\n\r\nAs the air grew black and the winter closed swiftly around me, the\r\nfluttering fire blazed out more luminous, and arresting its flight,\r\nhovered waiting. So soon as I came under its radiance, it flew slowly\r\non, lingering now and then above spots where the ground was rocky. Every\r\ntime I looked up, it seemed to have grown larger, and at length gave me\r\nan attendant shadow. Plainly a bird-butterfly, it flew with a certain\r\nswallowy double. Its wings were very large, nearly square, and flashed\r\nall the colours of the rainbow. Wondering at their splendour, I became\r\nso absorbed in their beauty that I stumbled over a low rock, and lay\r\nstunned. When I came to myself, the creature was hovering over my head,\r\nradiating the whole chord of light, with multitudinous gradations and\r\nsome kinds of colour I had never before seen. I rose and went on, but,\r\nunable to take my eyes off the shining thing to look to my steps, I\r\nstruck my foot against a stone. Fearing then another fall, I sat down to\r\nwatch the little glory, and a great longing awoke in me to have it in my\r\nhand. To my unspeakable delight, it began to sink toward me. Slowly at\r\nfirst, then swiftly it sank, growing larger as it came nearer. I felt\r\nas if the treasure of the universe were giving itself to me--put out my\r\nhand, and had it. But the instant I took it, its light went out; all was\r\ndark as pitch; a dead book with boards outspread lay cold and heavy in\r\nmy hand. I threw it in the air--only to hear it fall among the heather.\r\nBurying my face in my hands, I sat in motionless misery.\r\n\r\nBut the cold grew so bitter that, fearing to be frozen, I got up. The\r\nmoment I was on my feet, a faint sense of light awoke in me. "Is it\r\ncoming to life?" I cried, and a great pang of hope shot through me.\r\nAlas, no! it was the edge of a moon peering up keen and sharp over a\r\nlevel horizon! She brought me light--but no guidance! SHE would not\r\nhover over me, would not wait on my faltering steps! She could but offer\r\nme an ignorant choice!\r\n\r\nWith a full face she rose, and I began to see a little about me.\r\nWestward of her, and not far from me, a range of low hills broke the\r\nhorizon-line: I set out for it.\r\n\r\nBut what a night I had to pass ere I reached it! The moon seemed to know\r\nsomething, for she stared at me oddly. Her look was indeed icy-cold, but\r\nfull of interest, or at least curiosity. She was not the same moon I\r\nhad known on the earth; her face was strange to me, and her light yet\r\nstranger. Perhaps it came from an unknown sun! Every time I looked up,\r\nI found her staring at me with all her might! At first I was annoyed,\r\nas at the rudeness of a fellow creature; but soon I saw or fancied a\r\ncertain wondering pity in her gaze: why was I out in her night? Then\r\nfirst I knew what an awful thing it was to be awake in the universe: I\r\nWAS, and could not help it!\r\n\r\nAs I walked, my feet lost the heather, and trod a bare spongy soil,\r\nsomething like dry, powdery peat. To my dismay it gave a momentary heave\r\nunder me; then presently I saw what seemed the ripple of an earthquake\r\nrunning on before me, shadowy in the low moon. It passed into the\r\ndistance; but, while yet I stared after it, a single wave rose up, and\r\ncame slowly toward me. A yard or two away it burst, and from it, with a\r\nscramble and a bound, issued an animal like a tiger. About his mouth and\r\nears hung clots of mould, and his eyes winked and flamed as he rushed\r\nat me, showing his white teeth in a soundless snarl. I stood fascinated,\r\nunconscious of either courage or fear. He turned his head to the ground,\r\nand plunged into it.\r\n\r\n"That moon is affecting my brain," I said as I resumed my journey. "What\r\nlife can be here but the phantasmic--the stuff of which dreams are made?\r\nI am indeed walking in a vain show!"\r\n\r\nThus I strove to keep my heart above the waters of fear, nor knew that\r\nshe whom I distrusted was indeed my defence from the realities I took\r\nfor phantoms: her light controlled the monsters, else had I scarce taken\r\na second step on the hideous ground. "I will not be appalled by that\r\nwhich only seems!" I said to myself, yet felt it a terrible thing to\r\nwalk on a sea where such fishes disported themselves below. With that, a\r\nstep or two from me, the head of a worm began to come slowly out of the\r\nearth, as big as that of a polar bear and much resembling it, with a\r\nwhite mane to its red neck. The drawing wriggles with which its huge\r\nlength extricated itself were horrible, yet I dared not turn my eyes\r\nfrom them. The moment its tail was free, it lay as if exhausted,\r\nwallowing in feeble effort to burrow again.\r\n\r\n"Does it live on the dead," I wondered, "and is it unable to hurt the\r\nliving? If they scent their prey and come out, why do they leave me\r\nunharmed?"\r\n\r\nI know now it was that the moon paralysed them.\r\n\r\nAll the night through as I walked, hideous creatures, no two alike,\r\nthreatened me. In some of them, beauty of colour enhanced loathliness\r\nof shape: one large serpent was covered from head to distant tail with\r\nfeathers of glorious hues.\r\n\r\nI became at length so accustomed to their hurtless menaces that I\r\nfell to beguiling the way with the invention of monstrosities, never\r\nsuspecting that I owed each moment of life to the staring moon. Though\r\nhers was no primal radiance, it so hampered the evil things, that I\r\nwalked in safety. For light is yet light, if but the last of a countless\r\nseries of reflections! How swiftly would not my feet have carried me\r\nover the restless soil, had I known that, if still within their range\r\nwhen her lamp ceased to shine on the cursed spot, I should that moment\r\nbe at the mercy of such as had no mercy, the centre of a writhing heap\r\nof hideousness, every individual of it as terrible as before it had but\r\nseemed! Fool of ignorance, I watched the descent of the weary, solemn,\r\nanxious moon down the widening vault above me, with no worse uneasiness\r\nthan the dread of losing my way--where as yet I had indeed no way to\r\nlose.\r\n\r\nI was drawing near the hills I had made my goal, and she was now not far\r\nfrom their sky-line, when the soundless wallowing ceased, and the burrow\r\nlay motionless and bare. Then I saw, slowly walking over the light soil,\r\nthe form of a woman. A white mist floated about her, now assuming, now\r\nlosing to reassume the shape of a garment, as it gathered to her or was\r\nblown from her by a wind that dogged her steps.\r\n\r\nShe was beautiful, but with such a pride at once and misery on her\r\ncountenance that I could hardly believe what yet I saw. Up and down she\r\nwalked, vainly endeavouring to lay hold of the mist and wrap it around\r\nher. The eyes in the beautiful face were dead, and on her left side was\r\na dark spot, against which she would now and then press her hand, as\r\nif to stifle pain or sickness. Her hair hung nearly to her feet, and\r\nsometimes the wind would so mix it with the mist that I could not\r\ndistinguish the one from the other; but when it fell gathering together\r\nagain, it shone a pale gold in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly pressing both hands on her heart, she fell to the ground, and\r\nthe mist rose from her and melted in the air. I ran to her. But she\r\nbegan to writhe in such torture that I stood aghast. A moment more\r\nand her legs, hurrying from her body, sped away serpents. From her\r\nshoulders fled her arms as in terror, serpents also. Then something\r\nflew up from her like a bat, and when I looked again, she was gone. The\r\nground rose like the sea in a storm; terror laid hold upon me; I turned\r\nto the hills and ran.\r\n\r\nI was already on the slope of their base, when the moon sank behind one\r\nof their summits, leaving me in its shadow. Behind me rose a waste and\r\nsickening cry, as of frustrate desire--the only sound I had heard since\r\nthe fall of the dead butterfly; it made my heart shake like a flag in\r\nthe wind. I turned, saw many dark objects bounding after me, and made\r\nfor the crest of a ridge on which the moon still shone. She seemed to\r\nlinger there that I might see to defend myself. Soon I came in sight of\r\nher, and climbed the faster.\r\n\r\nCrossing the shadow of a rock, I heard the creatures panting at my\r\nheels. But just as the foremost threw himself upon me with a snarl of\r\ngreedy hate, we rushed into the moon together. She flashed out an angry\r\nlight, and he fell from me a bodiless blotch. Strength came to me, and\r\nI turned on the rest. But one by one as they darted into the light, they\r\ndropped with a howl; and I saw or fancied a strange smile on the round\r\nface above me.\r\n\r\nI climbed to the top of the ridge: far away shone the moon, sinking to\r\na low horizon. The air was pure and strong. I descended a little way,\r\nfound it warmer, and sat down to wait the dawn.\r\n\r\nThe moon went below, and the world again was dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE EVIL WOOD\r\n\r\nI fell fast asleep, and when I woke the sun was rising. I went to the\r\ntop again, and looked back: the hollow I had crossed in the moonlight\r\nlay without sign of life. Could it be that the calm expanse before me\r\nswarmed with creatures of devouring greed?\r\n\r\nI turned and looked over the land through which my way must lie. It\r\nseemed a wide desert, with a patch of a different colour in the\r\ndistance that might be a forest. Sign of presence, human or animal, was\r\nnone--smoke or dust or shadow of cultivation. Not a cloud floated in\r\nthe clear heaven; no thinnest haze curtained any segment of its circling\r\nrim.\r\n\r\nI descended, and set out for the imaginable forest: something alive\r\nmight be there; on this side of it could not well be anything!\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the plain, I found it, as far as my sight could go, of\r\nrock, here flat and channeled, there humped and pinnacled--evidently the\r\nwide bed of a vanished river, scored by innumerable water-runs, without\r\na trace of moisture in them. Some of the channels bore a dry moss, and\r\nsome of the rocks a few lichens almost as hard as themselves. The air,\r\nonce "filled with pleasant noise of waters," was silent as death.\r\nIt took me the whole day to reach the patch,--which I found indeed a\r\nforest--but not a rudiment of brook or runnel had I crossed! Yet through\r\nthe glowing noon I seemed haunted by an aural mirage, hearing so plainly\r\nthe voice of many waters that I could hardly believe the opposing\r\ntestimony of my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe sun was approaching the horizon when I left the river-bed, and\r\nentered the forest. Sunk below the tree-tops, and sending his rays\r\nbetween their pillar-like boles, he revealed a world of blessed shadows\r\nwaiting to receive me. I had expected a pine-wood, but here were trees\r\nof many sorts, some with strong resemblances to trees I knew, others\r\nwith marvellous differences from any I had ever seen. I threw myself\r\nbeneath the boughs of what seemed a eucalyptus in blossom: its flowers\r\nhad a hard calyx much resembling a skull, the top of which rose like a\r\nlid to let the froth-like bloom-brain overfoam its cup. From beneath\r\nthe shadow of its falchion-leaves my eyes went wandering into deep after\r\ndeep of the forest.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, its doors and windows began to close, shutting up aisle\r\nand corridor and roomier glade. The night was about me, and instant\r\nand sharp the cold. Again what a night I found it! How shall I make my\r\nreader share with me its wild ghostiness?\r\n\r\nThe tree under which I lay rose high before it branched, but the boughs\r\nof it bent so low that they seemed ready to shut me in as I leaned\r\nagainst the smooth stem, and let my eyes wander through the brief\r\ntwilight of the vanishing forest. Presently, to my listless roving\r\ngaze, the varied outlines of the clumpy foliage began to assume or\r\nimitate--say rather SUGGEST other shapes than their own. A light wind\r\nbegan to blow; it set the boughs of a neighbour tree rocking, and all\r\ntheir branches aswing, every twig and every leaf blending its individual\r\nmotion with the sway of its branch and the rock of its bough. Among\r\nits leafy shapes was a pack of wolves that struggled to break from\r\na wizard\'s leash: greyhounds would not have strained so savagely! I\r\nwatched them with an interest that grew as the wind gathered force, and\r\ntheir motions life.\r\n\r\nAnother mass of foliage, larger and more compact, presented my fancy\r\nwith a group of horses\' heads and forequarters projecting caparisoned\r\nfrom their stalls. Their necks kept moving up and down, with an\r\nimpatience that augmented as the growing wind broke their vertical\r\nrhythm with a wilder swaying from side to side. What heads they were!\r\nhow gaunt, how strange!--several of them bare skulls--one with the skin\r\ntight on its bones! One had lost the under jaw and hung low, looking\r\nunutterably weary--but now and then hove high as if to ease the bit.\r\nAbove them, at the end of a branch, floated erect the form of a woman,\r\nwaving her arms in imperious gesture. The definiteness of these and\r\nother leaf masses first surprised and then discomposed me: what if they\r\nshould overpower my brain with seeming reality? But the twilight became\r\ndarkness; the wind ceased; every shape was shut up in the night; I fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark when I began to be aware of a far-off, confused,\r\nrushing noise, mingled with faint cries. It grew and grew until a tumult\r\nas of gathering multitudes filled the wood. On all sides at once\r\nthe sounds drew nearer; the spot where I lay seemed the centre of a\r\ncommotion that extended throughout the forest. I scarce moved hand or\r\nfoot lest I should betray my presence to hostile things.\r\n\r\nThe moon at length approached the forest, and came slowly into it: with\r\nher first gleam the noises increased to a deafening uproar, and I began\r\nto see dim shapes about me. As she ascended and grew brighter, the\r\nnoises became yet louder, and the shapes clearer. A furious battle was\r\nraging around me. Wild cries and roars of rage, shock of onset, struggle\r\nprolonged, all mingled with words articulate, surged in my ears. Curses\r\nand credos, snarls and sneers, laughter and mockery, sacred names and\r\nhowls of hate, came huddling in chaotic interpenetration. Skeletons and\r\nphantoms fought in maddest confusion. Swords swept through the phantoms:\r\nthey only shivered. Maces crashed on the skeletons, shattering them\r\nhideously: not one fell or ceased to fight, so long as a single joint\r\nheld two bones together. Bones of men and horses lay scattered and\r\nheaped; grinding and crunching them under foot fought the skeletons.\r\nEverywhere charged the bone-gaunt white steeds; everywhere on foot or\r\non wind-blown misty battle-horses, raged and ravened and raved the\r\nindestructible spectres; weapons and hoofs clashed and crushed; while\r\nskeleton jaws and phantom-throats swelled the deafening tumult with the\r\nwar-cry of every opinion, bad or good, that had bred strife, injustice,\r\ncruelty in any world. The holiest words went with the most hating blow.\r\nLie-distorted truths flew hurtling in the wind of javelins and bones.\r\nEvery moment some one would turn against his comrades, and fight more\r\nwildly than before, THE TRUTH! THE TRUTH! still his cry. One I noted who\r\nwheeled ever in a circle, and smote on all sides. Wearied out, a pair\r\nwould sit for a minute side by side, then rise and renew the fierce\r\ncombat. None stooped to comfort the fallen, or stepped wide to spare\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe moon shone till the sun rose, and all the night long I had glimpses\r\nof a woman moving at her will above the strife-tormented multitude, now\r\non this front now on that, one outstretched arm urging the fight, the\r\nother pressed against her side. "Ye are men: slay one another!" she\r\nshouted. I saw her dead eyes and her dark spot, and recalled what I had\r\nseen the night before.\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle of the dead, which I saw and heard as I lay under\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nJust before sunrise, a breeze went through the forest, and a voice\r\ncried, "Let the dead bury their dead!" At the word the contending\r\nthousands dropped noiseless, and when the sun looked in, he saw never a\r\nbone, but here and there a withered branch.\r\n\r\nI rose and resumed my journey, through as quiet a wood as ever grew out\r\nof the quiet earth. For the wind of the morning had ceased when the sun\r\nappeared, and the trees were silent. Not a bird sang, not a squirrel,\r\nmouse, or weasel showed itself, not a belated moth flew athwart my path.\r\nBut as I went I kept watch over myself, nor dared let my eyes rest on\r\nany forest-shape. All the time I seemed to hear faint sounds of mattock\r\nand spade and hurtling bones: any moment my eyes might open on things I\r\nwould not see! Daylight prudence muttered that perhaps, to appear, ten\r\nthousand phantoms awaited only my consenting fancy.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the afternoon I came out of the wood--to find before\r\nme a second net of dry water-courses. I thought at first that I had\r\nwandered from my attempted line, and reversed my direction; but I soon\r\nsaw it was not so, and concluded presently that I had come to another\r\nbranch of the same river-bed. I began at once to cross it, and was in\r\nthe bottom of a wide channel when the sun set.\r\n\r\nI sat down to await the moon, and growing sleepy, stretched myself on\r\nthe moss. The moment my head was down, I heard the sounds of rushing\r\nstreams--all sorts of sweet watery noises. The veiled melody of the\r\nmolten music sang me into a dreamless sleep, and when I woke the sun\r\nwas already up, and the wrinkled country widely visible. Covered with\r\nshadows it lay striped and mottled like the skin of some wild animal. As\r\nthe sun rose the shadows diminished, and it seemed as if the rocks were\r\nre-absorbing the darkness that had oozed out of them during the night.\r\n\r\nHitherto I had loved my Arab mare and my books more, I fear, than live\r\nman or woman; now at length my soul was athirst for a human presence,\r\nand I longed even after those inhabitants of this alien world whom the\r\nraven had so vaguely described as nearest my sort. With heavy yet hoping\r\nheart, and mind haunted by a doubt whether I was going in any direction\r\nat all, I kept wearily travelling "north-west and by south."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. FRIENDS AND FOES\r\n\r\nComing, in one of the channels, upon what seemed a little shrub, the\r\noutlying picket, I trusted, of an army behind it, I knelt to look at\r\nit closer. It bore a small fruit, which, as I did not recognise it,\r\nI feared to gather and eat. Little I thought that I was watched from\r\nbehind the rocks by hundreds of eyes eager with the question whether I\r\nwould or would not take it.\r\n\r\nI came to another plant somewhat bigger, then to another larger still,\r\nand at length to clumps of a like sort; by which time I saw that they\r\nwere not shrubs but dwarf-trees. Before I reached the bank of this\r\nsecond branch of the river-bed, I found the channels so full of them\r\nthat it was with difficulty I crossed such as I could not jump. In one\r\nI heard a great rush, as of a multitude of birds from an ivied wall, but\r\nsaw nothing.\r\n\r\nI came next to some large fruit-bearing trees, but what they bore looked\r\ncoarse. They stood on the edge of a hollow, which evidently had once\r\nbeen the basin of a lake. From the left a forest seemed to flow into\r\nand fill it; but while the trees above were of many sorts, those in the\r\nhollow were almost entirely fruit-bearing.\r\n\r\nI went a few yards down the slope of grass mingled with moss, and\r\nstretched myself upon it weary. A little farther down stood a tiny tree\r\nfull of rosiest apples no bigger than small cherries, its top close to\r\nmy hand; I pulled and ate one of them. Finding it delicious, I was in\r\nthe act of taking another, when a sudden shouting of children, mingled\r\nwith laughter clear and sweet as the music of a brook, startled me with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n"He likes our apples! He likes our apples! He\'s a good giant! He\'s a\r\ngood giant!" cried many little voices.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a giant!" objected one.\r\n\r\n"He IS rather big," assented another, "but littleness isn\'t everything!\r\nIt won\'t keep you from growing big and stupid except you take care!"\r\n\r\nI rose on my elbow and stared. Above and about and below me stood a\r\nmultitude of children, apparently of all ages, some just able to run\r\nalone, and some about twelve or thirteen. Three or four seemed older.\r\nThey stood in a small knot, a little apart, and were less excited\r\nthan the rest. The many were chattering in groups, declaiming and\r\ncontradicting, like a crowd of grown people in a city, only with greater\r\nmerriment, better manners, and more sense.\r\n\r\nI gathered that, by the approach of my hand to a second apple, they knew\r\nthat I liked the first; but how from that they argued me good, I did not\r\nsee, nor wondered that one of them at least should suggest caution. I\r\ndid not open my mouth, for I was afraid of frightening them, and sure\r\nI should learn more by listening than by asking questions. For I\r\nunderstood nearly all they said--at which I was not surprised: to\r\nunderstand is not more wonderful than to love.\r\n\r\nThere came a movement and slight dispersion among them, and presently a\r\nsweet, innocent-looking, lovingly roguish little fellow handed me a huge\r\ngreen apple. Silence fell on the noisy throng; all waited expectant.\r\n\r\n"Eat, good giant," he said.\r\n\r\nI sat up, took the apple, smiled thanks, and would have eaten; but the\r\nmoment I bit into it, I flung it far away.\r\n\r\nAgain rose a shout of delight; they flung themselves upon me, so as\r\nnearly to smother me; they kissed my face and hands; they laid hold of\r\nmy legs; they clambered about my arms and shoulders, embracing my head\r\nand neck. I came to the ground at last, overwhelmed with the lovely\r\nlittle goblins.\r\n\r\n"Good, good giant!" they cried. "We knew you would come! Oh you dear,\r\ngood, strong giant!"\r\n\r\nThe babble of their talk sprang up afresh, and ever the jubilant shout\r\nwould rise anew from hundreds of clear little throats.\r\n\r\nAgain came a sudden silence. Those around me drew back; those atop of me\r\ngot off and began trying to set me on my feet. Upon their sweet faces,\r\nconcern had taken the place of merriment.\r\n\r\n"Get up, good giant!" said a little girl. "Make haste! much haste! He\r\nsaw you throw his apple away!"\r\n\r\nBefore she ended, I was on my feet. She stood pointing up the slope. On\r\nthe brow of it was a clownish, bad-looking fellow, a few inches taller\r\nthan myself. He looked hostile, but I saw no reason to fear him, for he\r\nhad no weapon, and my little friends had vanished every one.\r\n\r\nHe began to descend, and I, in the hope of better footing and position,\r\nto go up. He growled like a beast as he turned toward me.\r\n\r\nReaching a more level spot, I stood and waited for him. As he came near,\r\nhe held out his hand. I would have taken it in friendly fashion, but\r\nhe drew it back, threatened a blow, and held it out again. Then I\r\nunderstood him to claim the apple I had flung away, whereupon I made a\r\ngrimace of dislike and a gesture of rejection.\r\n\r\nHe answered with a howl of rage that seemed to say, "Do you dare tell me\r\nmy apple was not fit to eat?"\r\n\r\n"One bad apple may grow on the best tree," I said.\r\n\r\nWhether he perceived my meaning I cannot tell, but he made a stride\r\nnearer, and I stood on my guard. He delayed his assault, however, until\r\na second giant, much like him, who had been stealing up behind me, was\r\nclose enough, when he rushed upon me. I met him with a good blow in the\r\nface, but the other struck me on the back of the head, and between them\r\nI was soon overpowered.\r\n\r\nThey dragged me into the wood above the valley, where their tribe\r\nlived--in wretched huts, built of fallen branches and a few stones. Into\r\none of these they pushed me, there threw me on the ground, and kicked\r\nme. A woman was present, who looked on with indifference.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that during my captivity I hardly learned to\r\ndistinguish the women from the men, they differed so little. Often I\r\nwondered whether I had not come upon a sort of fungoid people, with just\r\nenough mind to give them motion and the expressions of anger and greed.\r\nTheir food, which consisted of tubers, bulbs, and fruits, was to me\r\ninexpressibly disagreeable, but nothing offended them so much as to show\r\ndislike to it. I was cuffed by the women and kicked by the men because I\r\nwould not swallow it.\r\n\r\nI lay on the floor that night hardly able to move, but I slept a good\r\ndeal, and woke a little refreshed. In the morning they dragged me to the\r\nvalley, and tying my feet, with a long rope, to a tree, put a flat stone\r\nwith a saw-like edge in my left hand. I shifted it to the right; they\r\nkicked me, and put it again in the left; gave me to understand that I\r\nwas to scrape the bark off every branch that had no fruit on it; kicked\r\nme once more, and left me.\r\n\r\nI set about the dreary work in the hope that by satisfying them I should\r\nbe left very much to myself--to make my observations and choose my time\r\nfor escape. Happily one of the dwarf-trees grew close by me, and\r\nevery other minute I plucked and ate a small fruit, which wonderfully\r\nrefreshed and strengthened me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE LITTLE ONES\r\n\r\nI had been at work but a few moments, when I heard small voices near me,\r\nand presently the Little Ones, as I soon found they called themselves,\r\ncame creeping out from among the tiny trees that like brushwood filled\r\nthe spaces between the big ones. In a minute there were scores and\r\nscores about me. I made signs that the giants had but just left me,\r\nand were not far off; but they laughed, and told me the wind was quite\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n"They are too blind to see us," they said, and laughed like a multitude\r\nof sheep-bells.\r\n\r\n"Do you like that rope about your ankles?" asked one.\r\n\r\n"I want them to think I cannot take it off," I replied.\r\n\r\n"They can scarcely see their own feet!" he rejoined. "Walk with short\r\nsteps and they will think the rope is all right."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he danced with merriment.\r\n\r\nOne of the bigger girls got down on her knees to untie the clumsy knot.\r\nI smiled, thinking those pretty fingers could do nothing with it, but in\r\na moment it was loose.\r\n\r\nThey then made me sit down, and fed me with delicious little fruits;\r\nafter which the smaller of them began to play with me in the wildest\r\nfashion, so that it was impossible for me to resume my work. When the\r\nfirst grew tired, others took their places, and this went on until the\r\nsun was setting, and heavy steps were heard approaching. The little\r\npeople started from me, and I made haste to put the rope round my\r\nankles.\r\n\r\n"We must have a care," said the girl who had freed me; "a crush of one\r\nof their horrid stumpy feet might kill a very little one!"\r\n\r\n"Can they not perceive you at all then?"\r\n\r\n"They might see something move; and if the children were in a heap on\r\nthe top of you, as they were a moment ago, it would be terrible; for\r\nthey hate every live thing but themselves.--Not that they are much alive\r\neither!"\r\n\r\nShe whistled like a bird. The next instant not one of them was to be\r\nseen or heard, and the girl herself had disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was my master, as doubtless he counted himself, come to take me home.\r\nHe freed my ankles, and dragged me to the door of his hut; there he\r\nthrew me on the ground, again tied my feet, gave me a kick, and left me.\r\n\r\nNow I might at once have made my escape; but at length I had friends,\r\nand could not think of leaving them. They were so charming, so full of\r\nwinsome ways, that I must see more of them! I must know them better!\r\n"To-morrow," I said to myself with delight, "I shall see them again!"\r\nBut from the moment there was silence in the huts until I fell asleep, I\r\nheard them whispering all about me, and knew that I was lovingly watched\r\nby a multitude. After that, I think they hardly ever left me quite\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI did not come to know the giants at all, and I believe there was\r\nscarcely anything in them to know. They never became in the least\r\nfriendly, but they were much too stupid to invent cruelties. Often I\r\navoided a bad kick by catching the foot and giving its owner a fall,\r\nupon which he never, on that occasion, renewed his attempt.\r\n\r\nBut the little people were constantly doing and saying things that\r\npleased, often things that surprised me. Every day I grew more loath\r\nto leave them. While I was at work, they would keep coming and going,\r\namusing and delighting me, and taking all the misery, and much of the\r\nweariness out of my monotonous toil. Very soon I loved them more than\r\nI can tell. They did not know much, but they were very wise, and seemed\r\ncapable of learning anything. I had no bed save the bare ground, but\r\nalmost as often as I woke, it was in a nest of children--one or other of\r\nthem in my arms, though which I seldom could tell until the light came,\r\nfor they ordered the succession among themselves. When one crept into my\r\nbosom, unconsciously I clasped him there, and the rest lay close around\r\nme, the smaller nearer. It is hardly necessary to say that I did not\r\nsuffer much from the nightly cold! The first thing they did in the\r\nmorning, and the last before sunset, was to bring the good giant plenty\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nOne morning I was surprised on waking to find myself alone. As I came\r\nto my senses, however, I heard subdued sounds of approach, and presently\r\nthe girl already mentioned, the tallest and gravest of the community,\r\nand regarded by all as their mother, appeared from the wood, followed by\r\nthe multitude in jubilation manifest--but silent lest they should rouse\r\nthe sleeping giant at whose door I lay. She carried a boy-baby in her\r\narms: hitherto a girl-baby, apparently about a year old, had been the\r\nyoungest. Three of the bigger girls were her nurses, but they shared\r\ntheir treasure with all the rest. Among the Little Ones, dolls were\r\nunknown; the bigger had the smaller, and the smaller the still less, to\r\ntend and play with.\r\n\r\nLona came to me and laid the infant in my arms. The baby opened his eyes\r\nand looked at me, closed them again, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n"He loves you already!" said the girl.\r\n\r\n"Where did you find him?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"In the wood, of course," she answered, her eyes beaming with delight,\r\n"--where we always find them. Isn\'t he a beauty? We\'ve been out all\r\nnight looking for him. Sometimes it is not easy to find!"\r\n\r\n"How do you know when there is one to find?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell," she replied. "Every one makes haste to tell the other,\r\nbut we never find out who told first. Sometimes I think one must have\r\nsaid it asleep, and another heard it half-awake. When there is a baby in\r\nthe wood, no one can stop to ask questions; and when we have found it,\r\nthen it is too late."\r\n\r\n"Do more boy or girl babies come to the wood?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t come to the wood; we go to the wood and find them."\r\n\r\n"Are there more boys or girls of you now?"\r\n\r\nI had found that to ask precisely the same question twice, made them\r\nknit their brows.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," she answered.\r\n\r\n"You can count them, surely!"\r\n\r\n"We never do that. We shouldn\'t like to be counted."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be smooth. We would rather not know."\r\n\r\n"Where do the babies come from first?"\r\n\r\n"From the wood--always. There is no other place they can come from."\r\n\r\nShe knew where they came from last, and thought nothing else was to be\r\nknown about their advent.\r\n\r\n"How often do you find one?"\r\n\r\n"Such a happy thing takes all the glad we\'ve got, and we forget the last\r\ntime. You too are glad to have him--are you not, good giant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, I am!" I answered. "But how do you feed him?"\r\n\r\n"I will show you," she rejoined, and went away--to return directly with\r\ntwo or three ripe little plums. She put one to the baby\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"He would open his mouth if he were awake," she said, and took him in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\nShe squeezed a drop to the surface, and again held the fruit to the\r\nbaby\'s lips. Without waking he began at once to suck it, and she went on\r\nslowly squeezing until nothing but skin and stone were left.\r\n\r\n"There!" she cried, in a tone of gentle triumph. "A big-apple world it\r\nwould be with nothing for the babies! We wouldn\'t stop in it--would we,\r\ndarling? We would leave it to the bad giants!"\r\n\r\n"But what if you let the stone into the baby\'s mouth when you were\r\nfeeding him?" I said.\r\n\r\n"No mother would do that," she replied. "I shouldn\'t be fit to have a\r\nbaby!"\r\n\r\nI thought what a lovely woman she would grow. But what became of them\r\nwhen they grew up? Where did they go? That brought me again to the\r\nquestion--where did they come from first?\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me where you lived before?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Here," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Have you NEVER lived anywhere else?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Never. We all came from the wood. Some think we dropped out of the\r\ntrees."\r\n\r\n"How is it there are so many of you quite little?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand. Some are less and some are bigger. I am very big."\r\n\r\n"Baby will grow bigger, won\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he will!"\r\n\r\n"And will you grow bigger?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. I hope not. I am the biggest. It frightens me\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\n"Why should it frighten you?"\r\n\r\nShe gave me no answer.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" I resumed.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you mean. We are all just that."\r\n\r\n"How big will the baby grow?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell.--Some," she added, with a trouble in her voice, "begin\r\nto grow after we think they have stopped.--That is a frightful thing. We\r\ndon\'t talk about it!"\r\n\r\n"What makes it frightful?"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, then answered,\r\n\r\n"We fear they may be beginning to grow giants."\r\n\r\n"Why should you fear that?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is so terrible.--I don\'t want to talk about it!"\r\n\r\nShe pressed the baby to her bosom with such an anxious look that I dared\r\nnot further question her.\r\n\r\nBefore long I began to perceive in two or three of the smaller children\r\nsome traces of greed and selfishness, and noted that the bigger girls\r\ncast on these a not infrequent glance of anxiety.\r\n\r\nNone of them put a hand to my work: they would do nothing for the\r\ngiants! But they never relaxed their loving ministrations to me. They\r\nwould sing to me, one after another, for hours; climb the tree to reach\r\nmy mouth and pop fruit into it with their dainty little fingers; and\r\nthey kept constant watch against the approach of a giant.\r\n\r\nSometimes they would sit and tell me stories--mostly very childish, and\r\noften seeming to mean hardly anything. Now and then they would call a\r\ngeneral assembly to amuse me. On one such occasion a moody little\r\nfellow sang me a strange crooning song, with a refrain so pathetic that,\r\nalthough unintelligible to me, it caused the tears to run down my face.\r\nThis phenomenon made those who saw it regard me with much perplexity.\r\nThen first I bethought myself that I had not once, in that world, looked\r\non water, falling or lying or running. Plenty there had been in some\r\nlong vanished age--that was plain enough--but the Little Ones had never\r\nseen any before they saw my tears! They had, nevertheless, it seemed,\r\nsome dim, instinctive perception of their origin; for a very small child\r\nwent up to the singer, shook his clenched pud in his face, and said\r\nsomething like this: "\'Ou skeeze ze juice out of ze good giant\'s\r\nseeberries! Bad giant!"\r\n\r\n"How is it," I said one day to Lona, as she sat with the baby in her\r\narms at the foot of my tree, "that I never see any children among the\r\ngiants?"\r\n\r\nShe stared a little, as if looking in vain for some sense in the\r\nquestion, then replied,\r\n\r\n"They are giants; there are no little ones."\r\n\r\n"Have they never any children?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No; there are never any in the wood for them. They do not love them. If\r\nthey saw ours, they would stamp them."\r\n\r\n"Is there always the same number of the giants then? I thought, before I\r\nhad time to know better, that they were your fathers and mothers."\r\n\r\nShe burst into the merriest laughter, and said,\r\n\r\n"No, good giant; WE are THEIR firsters."\r\n\r\nBut as she said it, the merriment died out of her, and she looked\r\nscared.\r\n\r\nI stopped working, and gazed at her, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"How CAN that be?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I do not say; I do not understand," she answered. "But we were here and\r\nthey not. They go from us. I am sorry, but we cannot help it. THEY could\r\nhave helped it."\r\n\r\n"How long have you been here?" I asked, more and more puzzled--in the\r\nhope of some side-light on the matter.\r\n\r\n"Always, I think," she replied. "I think somebody made us always."\r\n\r\nI turned to my scraping.\r\n\r\nShe saw I did not understand.\r\n\r\n"The giants were not made always," she resumed. "If a Little One doesn\'t\r\ncare, he grows greedy, and then lazy, and then big, and then stupid, and\r\nthen bad. The dull creatures don\'t know that they come from us. Very\r\nfew of them believe we are anywhere. They say NONSENSE!--Look at little\r\nBlunty: he is eating one of their apples! He will be the next! Oh! oh!\r\nhe will soon be big and bad and ugly, and not know it!"\r\n\r\nThe child stood by himself a little way off, eating an apple nearly\r\nas big as his head. I had often thought he did not look so good as the\r\nrest; now he looked disgusting.\r\n\r\n"I will take the horrid thing from him!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"It is no use," she answered sadly. "We have done all we can, and it\r\nis too late! We were afraid he was growing, for he would not believe\r\nanything told him; but when he refused to share his berries, and said\r\nhe had gathered them for himself, then we knew it! He is a glutton, and\r\nthere is no hope of him.--It makes me sick to see him eat!"\r\n\r\n"Could not some of the boys watch him, and not let him touch the\r\npoisonous things?"\r\n\r\n"He may have them if he will: it is all one--to eat the apples, and to\r\nbe a boy that would eat them if he could. No; he must go to the giants!\r\nHe belongs to them. You can see how much bigger he is than when first\r\nyou came! He is bigger since yesterday."\r\n\r\n"He is as like that hideous green lump in his hand as boy could look!"\r\n\r\n"It suits what he is making himself."\r\n\r\n"His head and it might change places!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they do!"\r\n\r\n"Does he want to be a giant?"\r\n\r\n"He hates the giants, but he is making himself one all the same: he\r\nlikes their apples! Oh baby, baby, he was just such a darling as you\r\nwhen we found him!"\r\n\r\n"He will be very miserable when he finds himself a giant!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; he will like it well enough! That is the worst of it."\r\n\r\n"Will he hate the Little Ones?"\r\n\r\n"He will be like the rest; he will not remember us--most likely will\r\nnot believe there are Little Ones. He will not care; he will eat his\r\napples."\r\n\r\n"Do tell me how it will come about. I understand your world so little! I\r\ncome from a world where everything is different."\r\n\r\n"I do not know about WORLD. What is it? What more but a word in your\r\nbeautiful big mouth?--That makes it something!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind about the word; tell me what next will happen to Blunty."\r\n\r\n"He will wake one morning and find himself a giant--not like you, good\r\ngiant, but like any other bad giant. You will hardly know him, but I\r\nwill tell you which. He will think he has been a giant always, and will\r\nnot know you, or any of us. The giants have lost themselves, Peony says,\r\nand that is why they never smile. I wonder whether they are not glad\r\nbecause they are bad, or bad because they are not glad. But they can\'t\r\nbe glad when they have no babies! I wonder what BAD means, good giant!"\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew no more about it than you!" I returned. "But I try to be\r\ngood, and mean to keep on trying."\r\n\r\n"So do I--and that is how I know you are good."\r\n\r\nA long pause followed.\r\n\r\n"Then you do not know where the babies come from into the wood?" I said,\r\nmaking one attempt more.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to know there," she answered. "They are in the wood;\r\nthey grow there."\r\n\r\n"Then how is it you never find one before it is quite grown?" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe knitted her brows and was silent a moment:\r\n\r\n"They\'re not there till they\'re finished," she said.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity the little sillies can\'t speak till they\'ve forgotten\r\neverything they had to tell!" I remarked.\r\n\r\n"Little Tolma, the last before this baby, looked as if she had something\r\nto tell, when I found her under a beech-tree, sucking her thumb, but she\r\nhadn\'t. She only looked up at me--oh, so sweetly! SHE will never go\r\nbad and grow big! When they begin to grow big they care for nothing but\r\nbigness; and when they cannot grow any bigger, they try to grow fatter.\r\nThe bad giants are very proud of being fat."\r\n\r\n"So they are in my world," I said; "only they do not say FAT there, they\r\nsay RICH."\r\n\r\n"In one of their houses," continued Lona, "sits the biggest and fattest\r\nof them--so proud that nobody can see him; and the giants go to his\r\nhouse at certain times, and call out to him, and tell him how fat he is,\r\nand beg him to make them strong to eat more and grow fat like him."\r\n\r\nThe rumour at length reached my ears that Blunty had vanished. I saw a\r\nfew grave faces among the bigger ones, but he did not seem to be much\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lona came to me and whispered,\r\n\r\n"Look! look there--by that quince-tree: that is the giant that was\r\nBlunty!--Would you have known him?"\r\n\r\n"Never," I answered. "--But now you tell me, I could fancy it might be\r\nBlunty staring through a fog! He DOES look stupid!"\r\n\r\n"He is for ever eating those apples now!" she said. "That is what comes\r\nof Little Ones that WON\'T be little!"\r\n\r\n"They call it growing-up in my world!" I said to myself. "If only she\r\nwould teach me to grow the other way, and become a Little One!--Shall I\r\never be able to laugh like them?"\r\n\r\nI had had the chance, and had flung it from me! Blunty and I were alike!\r\nHe did not know his loss, and I had to be taught mine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. A CRISIS\r\n\r\nFor a time I had no desire save to spend my life with the Little Ones.\r\nBut soon other thoughts and feelings began to influence me. First awoke\r\nthe vague sense that I ought to be doing something; that I was not\r\nmeant for the fattening of boors! Then it came to me that I was in a\r\nmarvellous world, of which it was assuredly my business to discover\r\nthe ways and laws; and that, if I would do anything in return for the\r\nchildren\'s goodness, I must learn more about them than they could tell\r\nme, and to that end must be free. Surely, I thought, no suppression of\r\ntheir growth can be essential to their loveliness and truth and purity!\r\nNot in any world could the possibility exist of such a discord between\r\nconstitution and its natural outcome! Life and law cannot be so at\r\nvariance that perfection must be gained by thwarting development! But\r\nthe growth of the Little Ones WAS arrested! something interfered with\r\nit: what was it? Lona seemed the eldest of them, yet not more than\r\nfifteen, and had been long in charge of a multitude, in semblance and\r\nmostly in behaviour merest children, who regarded her as their mother!\r\nWere they growing at all? I doubted it. Of time they had scarcely the\r\nidea; of their own age they knew nothing! Lona herself thought she had\r\nlived always! Full of wisdom and empty of knowledge, she was at once\r\ntheir Love and their Law! But what seemed to me her ignorance might in\r\ntruth be my own lack of insight! Her one anxiety plainly was, that her\r\nLittle Ones should not grow, and change into bad giants! Their "good\r\ngiant" was bound to do his best for them: without more knowledge of\r\ntheir nature, and some knowledge of their history, he could do nothing,\r\nand must therefore leave them! They would only be as they were\r\nbefore; they had in no way become dependent on me; they were still\r\nmy protectors, I was not theirs; my presence but brought them more in\r\ndanger of their idiotic neighbours! I longed to teach them many things:\r\nI must first understand more of those I would teach! Knowledge no\r\ndoubt made bad people worse, but it must make good people better! I was\r\nconvinced they would learn mathematics; and might they not be taught to\r\nwrite down the dainty melodies they murmured and forgot?\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was, that I must rise and continue my travels, in the\r\nhope of coming upon some elucidation of the fortunes and destiny of the\r\nbewitching little creatures.\r\n\r\nMy design, however, would not so soon have passed into action, but for\r\nwhat now occurred.\r\n\r\nTo prepare them for my temporary absence, I was one day telling them\r\nwhile at work that I would long ago have left the bad giants, but that I\r\nloved the Little Ones so much--when, as by one accord, they came rushing\r\nand crowding upon me; they scrambled over each other and up the tree and\r\ndropped on my head, until I was nearly smothered. With three very little\r\nones in my arms, one on each shoulder clinging to my neck, one standing\r\nstraight up on my head, four or five holding me fast by the legs, others\r\ngrappling my body and arms, and a multitude climbing and descending upon\r\nthese, I was helpless as one overwhelmed by lava. Absorbed in the merry\r\nstruggle, not one of them saw my tyrant coming until he was almost upon\r\nme. With just one cry of "Take care, good giant!" they ran from me like\r\nmice, they dropped from me like hedgehogs, they flew from me up the tree\r\nlike squirrels, and the same moment, sharp round the stem came the bad\r\ngiant, and dealt me such a blow on the head with a stick that I fell to\r\nthe ground. The children told me afterwards that they sent him "such\r\na many bumps of big apples and stones" that he was frightened, and ran\r\nblundering home.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself it was night. Above me were a few pale stars that\r\nexpected the moon. I thought I was alone. My head ached badly, and I was\r\nterribly athirst.\r\n\r\nI turned wearily on my side. The moment my ear touched the ground, I\r\nheard the gushing and gurgling of water, and the soft noises made me\r\ngroan with longing. At once I was amid a multitude of silent children,\r\nand delicious little fruits began to visit my lips. They came and came\r\nuntil my thirst was gone.\r\n\r\nThen I was aware of sounds I had never heard there before; the air was\r\nfull of little sobs.\r\n\r\nI tried to sit up. A pile of small bodies instantly heaped itself at my\r\nback. Then I struggled to my feet, with much pushing and pulling from\r\nthe Little Ones, who were wonderfully strong for their size.\r\n\r\n"You must go away, good giant," they said. "When the bad giants see you\r\nhurt, they will all trample on you."\r\n\r\n"I think I must," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Go and grow strong, and come again," they said.\r\n\r\n"I will," I replied--and sat down.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you must go at once!" whispered Lona, who had been supporting\r\nme, and now knelt beside me.\r\n\r\n"I listened at his door," said one of the bigger boys, "and heard the\r\nbad giant say to his wife that he had found you idle, talking to a lot\r\nof moles and squirrels, and when he beat you, they tried to kill him. He\r\nsaid you were a wizard, and they must knock you, or they would have no\r\npeace."\r\n\r\n"I will go at once," I said, "and come back as soon as I have found out\r\nwhat is wanted to make you bigger and stronger."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want to be bigger," they answered, looking very serious.\r\n"We WON\'T grow bad giants!--We are strong now; you don\'t know how much\r\nstrong!"\r\n\r\nIt was no use holding them out a prospect that had not any attraction\r\nfor them! I said nothing more, but rose and moved slowly up the slope of\r\nthe valley. At once they formed themselves into a long procession; some\r\nled the way, some walked with me helping me, and the rest followed. They\r\nkept feeding me as we went.\r\n\r\n"You are broken," they said, "and much red juice has run out of you: put\r\nsome in."\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the edge of the valley, there was the moon just lifting\r\nher forehead over the rim of the horizon.\r\n\r\n"She has come to take care of you, and show you the way," said Lona.\r\n\r\nI questioned those about me as we walked, and learned there was a great\r\nplace with a giant-girl for queen. When I asked if it was a city, they\r\nsaid they did not know. Neither could they tell how far off, or in what\r\ndirection it was, or what was the giant-girl\'s name; all they knew was,\r\nthat she hated the Little Ones, and would like to kill them, only she\r\ncould not find them. I asked how they knew that; Lona answered that she\r\nhad always known it. If the giant-girl came to look for them, they must\r\nhide hard, she said. When I told them I should go and ask her why she\r\nhated them, they cried out,\r\n\r\n"No, no! she will kill you, good giant; she will kill you! She is an\r\nawful bad-giant witch!"\r\n\r\nI asked them where I was to go then. They told me that, beyond the\r\nbaby-forest, away where the moon came from, lay a smooth green country,\r\npleasant to the feet, without rocks or trees. But when I asked how I was\r\nto set out for it.\r\n\r\n"The moon will tell you, we think," they said.\r\n\r\nThey were taking me up the second branch of the river bed: when they saw\r\nthat the moon had reached her height, they stopped to return.\r\n\r\n"We have never gone so far from our trees before," they said. "Now mind\r\nyou watch how you go, that you may see inside your eyes how to come back\r\nto us."\r\n\r\n"And beware of the giant-woman that lives in the desert," said one of\r\nthe bigger girls as they were turning, "I suppose you have heard of\r\nher!"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Then take care not to go near her. She is called the Cat-woman. She is\r\nawfully ugly--AND SCRATCHES."\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bigger ones stopped, the smaller had begun to run back.\r\nThe others now looked at me gravely for a moment, and then walked slowly\r\naway. Last to leave me, Lona held up the baby to be kissed, gazed in\r\nmy eyes, whispered, "The Cat-woman will not hurt YOU," and went without\r\nanother word. I stood a while, gazing after them through the moonlight,\r\nthen turned and, with a heavy heart, began my solitary journey. Soon the\r\nlaughter of the Little Ones overtook me, like sheep-bells innumerable,\r\nrippling the air, and echoing in the rocks about me. I turned again, and\r\nagain gazed after them: they went gamboling along, with never a care in\r\ntheir sweet souls. But Lona walked apart with her baby.\r\n\r\nPondering as I went, I recalled many traits of my little friends.\r\n\r\nOnce when I suggested that they should leave the country of the bad\r\ngiants, and go with me to find another, they answered, "But that would\r\nbe to NOT ourselves!"--so strong in them was the love of place that\r\ntheir country seemed essential to their very being! Without ambition or\r\nfear, discomfort or greed, they had no motive to desire any change; they\r\nknew of nothing amiss; and, except their babies, they had never had a\r\nchance of helping any one but myself:--How were they to grow? But again,\r\nWhy should they grow? In seeking to improve their conditions, might\r\nI not do them harm, and only harm? To enlarge their minds after the\r\nnotions of my world--might it not be to distort and weaken them? Their\r\nfear of growth as a possible start for gianthood might be instinctive!\r\n\r\nThe part of philanthropist is indeed a dangerous one; and the man who\r\nwould do his neighbour good must first study how not to do him evil, and\r\nmust begin by pulling the beam out of his own eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A STRANGE HOSTESS\r\n\r\nI travelled on attended by the moon. As usual she was full--I had never\r\nseen her other--and to-night as she sank I thought I perceived something\r\nlike a smile on her countenance.\r\n\r\nWhen her under edge was a little below the horizon, there appeared in\r\nthe middle of her disc, as if it had been painted upon it, a cottage,\r\nthrough the open door and window of which she shone; and with the sight\r\ncame the conviction that I was expected there. Almost immediately the\r\nmoon was gone, and the cottage had vanished; the night was rapidly\r\ngrowing dark, and my way being across a close succession of small\r\nravines, I resolved to remain where I was and expect the morning. I\r\nstretched myself, therefore, in a sandy hollow, made my supper off the\r\nfruits the children had given me at parting, and was soon asleep.\r\n\r\nI woke suddenly, saw above me constellations unknown to my former world,\r\nand had lain for a while gazing at them, when I became aware of a figure\r\nseated on the ground a little way from and above me. I was startled, as\r\none is on discovering all at once that he is not alone. The figure was\r\nbetween me and the sky, so that I saw its outline well. From where I lay\r\nlow in the hollow, it seemed larger than human.\r\n\r\nIt moved its head, and then first I saw that its back was toward me.\r\n\r\n"Will you not come with me?" said a sweet, mellow voice, unmistakably a\r\nwoman\'s.\r\n\r\nWishing to learn more of my hostess,\r\n\r\n"I thank you," I replied, "but I am not uncomfortable here. Where would\r\nyou have me go? I like sleeping in the open air."\r\n\r\n"There is no hurt in the air," she returned; "but the creatures that\r\nroam the night in these parts are not such as a man would willingly have\r\nabout him while he sleeps."\r\n\r\n"I have not been disturbed," I said.\r\n\r\n"No; I have been sitting by you ever since you lay down."\r\n\r\n"That is very kind of you! How came you to know I was here? Why do you\r\nshow me such favour?"\r\n\r\n"I saw you," she answered, still with her back to me, "in the light of\r\nthe moon, just as she went down. I see badly in the day, but at night\r\nperfectly. The shadow of my house would have hidden you, but both\r\nits doors were open. I was out on the waste, and saw you go into this\r\nhollow. You were asleep, however, before I could reach you, and I was\r\nnot willing to disturb you. People are frightened if I come on them\r\nsuddenly. They call me the Cat-woman. It is not my name."\r\n\r\nI remembered what the children had told me--that she was very ugly, and\r\nscratched. But her voice was gentle, and its tone a little apologetic:\r\nshe could not be a bad giantess!\r\n\r\n"You shall not hear it from me," I answered, "Please tell me what I MAY\r\ncall you!"\r\n\r\n"When you know me, call me by the name that seems to you to fit me," she\r\nreplied: "that will tell me what sort you are. People do not often give\r\nme the right one. It is well when they do."\r\n\r\n"I suppose, madam, you live in the cottage I saw in the heart of the\r\nmoon?"\r\n\r\n"I do. I live there alone, except when I have visitors. It is a poor\r\nplace, but I do what I can for my guests, and sometimes their sleep is\r\nsweet to them."\r\n\r\nHer voice entered into me, and made me feel strangely still.\r\n\r\n"I will go with you, madam," I said, rising.\r\n\r\nShe rose at once, and without a glance behind her led the way. I could\r\nsee her just well enough to follow. She was taller than myself, but not\r\nso tall as I had thought her. That she never turned her face to me made\r\nme curious--nowise apprehensive, her voice rang so true. But how was I\r\nto fit her with a name who could not see her? I strove to get alongside\r\nof her, but failed: when I quickened my pace she quickened hers, and\r\nkept easily ahead of me. At length I did begin to grow a little afraid.\r\nWhy was she so careful not to be seen? Extraordinary ugliness would\r\naccount for it: she might fear terrifying me! Horror of an inconceivable\r\nmonstrosity began to assail me: was I following through the dark\r\nan unheard of hideousness? Almost I repented of having accepted her\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nNeither spoke, and the silence grew unbearable. I MUST break it!\r\n\r\n"I want to find my way," I said, "to a place I have heard of, but whose\r\nname I have not yet learned. Perhaps you can tell it me!"\r\n\r\n"Describe it, then, and I will direct you. The stupid Bags know nothing,\r\nand the careless little Lovers forget almost everything."\r\n\r\n"Where do those live?"\r\n\r\n"You are just come from them!"\r\n\r\n"I never heard those names before!"\r\n\r\n"You would not hear them. Neither people knows its own name!"\r\n\r\n"Strange!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so! but hardly any one anywhere knows his own name! It would\r\nmake many a fine gentleman stare to hear himself addressed by what is\r\nreally his name!"\r\n\r\nI held my peace, beginning to wonder what my name might be.\r\n\r\n"What now do you fancy yours?" she went on, as if aware of my thought.\r\n"But, pardon me, it is a matter of no consequence."\r\n\r\nI had actually opened my mouth to answer her, when I discovered that my\r\nname was gone from me. I could not even recall the first letter of it!\r\nThis was the second time I had been asked my name and could not tell it!\r\n\r\n"Never mind," she said; "it is not wanted. Your real name, indeed, is\r\nwritten on your forehead, but at present it whirls about so irregularly\r\nthat nobody can read it. I will do my part to steady it. Soon it will go\r\nslower, and, I hope, settle at last."\r\n\r\nThis startled me, and I was silent.\r\n\r\nWe had left the channels and walked a long time, but no sign of the\r\ncottage yet appeared.\r\n\r\n"The Little Ones told me," I said at length, "of a smooth green country,\r\npleasant to the feet!"\r\n\r\n"Yes?" she returned.\r\n\r\n"They told me too of a girl giantess that was queen somewhere: is that\r\nher country?"\r\n\r\n"There is a city in that grassy land," she replied, "where a woman is\r\nprincess. The city is called Bulika. But certainly the princess is not\r\na girl! She is older than this world, and came to it from yours--with\r\na terrible history, which is not over yet. She is an evil person, and\r\nprevails much with the Prince of the Power of the Air. The people of\r\nBulika were formerly simple folk, tilling the ground and pasturing\r\nsheep. She came among them, and they received her hospitably. She taught\r\nthem to dig for diamonds and opals and sell them to strangers, and made\r\nthem give up tillage and pasturage and build a city. One day they found\r\na huge snake and killed it; which so enraged her that she declared\r\nherself their princess, and became terrible to them. The name of the\r\ncountry at that time was THE LAND OF WATERS; for the dry channels,\r\nof which you have crossed so many, were then overflowing with live\r\ntorrents; and the valley, where now the Bags and the Lovers have their\r\nfruit-trees, was a lake that received a great part of them. But the\r\nwicked princess gathered up in her lap what she could of the water over\r\nthe whole country, closed it in an egg, and carried it away. Her lap,\r\nhowever, would not hold more than half of it; and the instant she was\r\ngone, what she had not yet taken fled away underground, leaving the\r\ncountry as dry and dusty as her own heart. Were it not for the waters\r\nunder it, every living thing would long ago have perished from it. For\r\nwhere no water is, no rain falls; and where no rain falls, no springs\r\nrise. Ever since then, the princess has lived in Bulika, holding the\r\ninhabitants in constant terror, and doing what she can to keep them from\r\nmultiplying. Yet they boast and believe themselves a prosperous, and\r\ncertainly are a self-satisfied people--good at bargaining and buying,\r\ngood at selling and cheating; holding well together for a common\r\ninterest, and utterly treacherous where interests clash; proud of their\r\nprincess and her power, and despising every one they get the better of;\r\nnever doubting themselves the most honourable of all the nations, and\r\neach man counting himself better than any other. The depth of their\r\nworthlessness and height of their vainglory no one can understand who\r\nhas not been there to see, who has not learned to know the miserable\r\nmisgoverned and self-deceived creatures."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, madam. And now, if you please, will you tell me something\r\nabout the Little Ones--the Lovers? I long heartily to serve them. Who\r\nand what are they? and how do they come to be there? Those children are\r\nthe greatest wonder I have found in this world of wonders."\r\n\r\n"In Bulika you may, perhaps, get some light on those matters. There is\r\nan ancient poem in the library of the palace, I am told, which of course\r\nno one there can read, but in which it is plainly written that after the\r\nLovers have gone through great troubles and learned their own name, they\r\nwill fill the land, and make the giants their slaves."\r\n\r\n"By that time they will have grown a little, will they not?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they will have grown; yet I think too they will not have grown.\r\nIt is possible to grow and not to grow, to grow less and to grow bigger,\r\nboth at once--yes, even to grow by means of not growing!"\r\n\r\n"Your words are strange, madam!" I rejoined. "But I have heard it said\r\nthat some words, because they mean more, appear to mean less!"\r\n\r\n"That is true, and such words HAVE to be understood. It were well for\r\nthe princess of Bulika if she heard what the very silence of the land\r\nis shouting in her ears all day long! But she is far too clever to\r\nunderstand anything."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose, when the little Lovers are grown, their land will have\r\nwater again?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly so: when they are thirsty enough, they will have water,\r\nand when they have water, they will grow. To grow, they must have water.\r\nAnd, beneath, it is flowing still."\r\n\r\n"I have heard that water twice," I said; "--once when I lay down to wait\r\nfor the moon--and when I woke the sun was shining! and once when I\r\nfell, all but killed by the bad giant. Both times came the voices of the\r\nwater, and healed me."\r\n\r\nThe woman never turned her head, and kept always a little before me, but\r\nI could hear every word that left her lips, and her voice much reminded\r\nme of the woman\'s in the house of death. Much of what she said, I did\r\nnot understand, and therefore cannot remember. But I forgot that I had\r\never been afraid of her.\r\n\r\nWe went on and on, and crossed yet a wide tract of sand before reaching\r\nthe cottage. Its foundation stood in deep sand, but I could see that\r\nit was a rock. In character the cottage resembled the sexton\'s, but had\r\nthicker walls. The door, which was heavy and strong, opened immediately\r\ninto a large bare room, which had two little windows opposite each\r\nother, without glass. My hostess walked in at the open door out of which\r\nthe moon had looked, and going straight to the farthest corner, took a\r\nlong white cloth from the floor, and wound it about her head and face.\r\nThen she closed the other door, in at which the moon had looked, trimmed\r\na small horn lantern that stood on the hearth, and turned to receive me.\r\n\r\n"You are very welcome, Mr. Vane!" she said, calling me by the name I had\r\nforgotten. "Your entertainment will be scanty, but, as the night is not\r\nfar spent, and the day not at hand, it is better you should be indoors.\r\nHere you will be safe, and a little lack is not a great misery."\r\n\r\n"I thank you heartily, madam," I replied. "But, seeing you know the name\r\nI could not tell you, may I not now know yours?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Mara," she answered.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered the sexton and the little black cat.\r\n\r\n"Some people," she went on, "take me for Lot\'s wife, lamenting over\r\nSodom; and some think I am Rachel, weeping for her children; but I am\r\nneither of those."\r\n\r\n"I thank you again, Mara," I said. "--May I lie here on your floor till\r\nthe morning?"\r\n\r\n"At the top of that stair," she answered, "you will find a bed--on which\r\nsome have slept better than they expected, and some have waked all the\r\nnight and slept all the next day. It is not a very soft one, but it is\r\nbetter than the sand--and there are no hyenas sniffing about it!"\r\n\r\nThe stair, narrow and steep, led straight up from the room to an\r\nunceiled and unpartitioned garret, with one wide, low dormer window.\r\nClose under the sloping roof stood a narrow bed, the sight of which with\r\nits white coverlet made me shiver, so vividly it recalled the couches in\r\nthe chamber of death. On the table was a dry loaf, and beside it a cup\r\nof cold water. To me, who had tasted nothing but fruit for months, they\r\nwere a feast.\r\n\r\n"I must leave you in the dark," my hostess called from the bottom of the\r\nstair. "This lantern is all the light I have, and there are things to do\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"It is of no consequence, thank you, madam," I returned. "To eat and\r\ndrink, to lie down and sleep, are things that can be done in the dark."\r\n\r\n"Rest in peace," she said.\r\n\r\nI ate up the loaf, drank the water every drop, and laid myself down.\r\nThe bed was hard, the covering thin and scanty, and the night cold: I\r\ndreamed that I lay in the chamber of death, between the warrior and the\r\nlady with the healing wound.\r\n\r\nI woke in the middle of the night, thinking I heard low noises of wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n"Creatures of the desert scenting after me, I suppose!" I said to\r\nmyself, and, knowing I was safe, would have gone to sleep again. But\r\nthat instant a rough purring rose to a howl under my window, and I\r\nsprang from my bed to see what sort of beast uttered it.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of the cottage, in the full radiance of the moon, a tall\r\nwoman stood, clothed in white, with her back toward me. She was stooping\r\nover a large white animal like a panther, patting and stroking it with\r\none hand, while with the other she pointed to the moon half-way up the\r\nheaven, then drew a perpendicular line to the horizon. Instantly the\r\ncreature darted off with amazing swiftness in the direction indicated.\r\nFor a moment my eyes followed it, then sought the woman; but she was\r\ngone, and not yet had I seen her face! Again I looked after the animal,\r\nbut whether I saw or only fancied a white speck in the distance, I could\r\nnot tell.--What did it mean? What was the monster-cat sent off to do? I\r\nshuddered, and went back to my bed. Then I remembered that, when I lay\r\ndown in the sandy hollow outside, the moon was setting; yet here\r\nshe was, a few hours after, shining in all her glory! "Everything is\r\nuncertain here," I said to myself, "--even the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies!"\r\n\r\nI learned afterward that there were several moons in the service of this\r\nworld, but the laws that ruled their times and different orbits I failed\r\nto discover.\r\n\r\nAgain I fell asleep, and slept undisturbed.\r\n\r\nWhen I went down in the morning, I found bread and water waiting me, the\r\nloaf so large that I ate only half of it. My hostess sat muffled beside\r\nme while I broke my fast, and except to greet me when I entered, never\r\nopened her mouth until I asked her to instruct me how to arrive at\r\nBulika. She then told me to go up the bank of the river-bed until it\r\ndisappeared; then verge to the right until I came to a forest--in which\r\nI might spend a night, but which I must leave with my face to the rising\r\nmoon. Keeping in the same direction, she said, until I reached a running\r\nstream, I must cross that at right angles, and go straight on until I\r\nsaw the city on the horizon.\r\n\r\nI thanked her, and ventured the remark that, looking out of the window\r\nin the night, I was astonished to see her messenger understand her so\r\nwell, and go so straight and so fast in the direction she had indicated.\r\n\r\n"If I had but that animal of yours to guide me--" I went on, hoping to\r\nlearn something of its mission, but she interrupted me, saying,\r\n\r\n"It was to Bulika she went--the shortest way."\r\n\r\n"How wonderfully intelligent she looked!"\r\n\r\n"Astarte knows her work well enough to be sent to do it," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Have you many messengers like her?"\r\n\r\n"As many as I require."\r\n\r\n"Are they hard to teach?"\r\n\r\n"They need no teaching. They are all of a certain breed, but not one of\r\nthe breed is like another. Their origin is so natural it would seem to\r\nyou incredible."\r\n\r\n"May I not know it?"\r\n\r\n"A new one came to me last night--from your head while you slept."\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n"All in this world seem to love mystery!" I said to myself. "Some chance\r\nword of mine suggested an idea--and in this form she embodies the small\r\nfact!"\r\n\r\n"Then the creature is mine!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Not at all!" she answered. "That only can be ours in whose existence\r\nour will is a factor."\r\n\r\n"Ha! a metaphysician too!" I remarked inside, and was silent.\r\n\r\n"May I take what is left of the loaf?" I asked presently.\r\n\r\n"You will want no more to-day," she replied.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow I may!" I rejoined.\r\n\r\nShe rose and went to the door, saying as she went,\r\n\r\n"It has nothing to do with to-morrow--but you may take it if you will."\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, and stood holding it. I rose, taking up the\r\nbread--but lingered, much desiring to see her face.\r\n\r\n"Must I go, then?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No one sleeps in my house two nights together!" she answered.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, then, for your hospitality, and bid you farewell!" I said,\r\nand turned to go.\r\n\r\n"The time will come when you must house with me many days and many\r\nnights," she murmured sadly through her muffling.\r\n\r\n"Willingly," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Nay, NOT willingly!" she answered.\r\n\r\nI said to myself that she was right--I would not willingly be her guest\r\na second time! but immediately my heart rebuked me, and I had scarce\r\ncrossed the threshold when I turned again.\r\n\r\nShe stood in the middle of the room; her white garments lay like foamy\r\nwaves at her feet, and among them the swathings of her face: it was\r\nlovely as a night of stars. Her great gray eyes looked up to heaven;\r\ntears were flowing down her pale cheeks. She reminded me not a little\r\nof the sexton\'s wife, although the one looked as if she had not wept for\r\nthousands of years, and the other as if she wept constantly behind the\r\nwrappings of her beautiful head. Yet something in the very eyes that\r\nwept seemed to say, "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in\r\nthe morning."\r\n\r\nI had bowed my head for a moment, about to kneel and beg her\r\nforgiveness, when, looking up in the act, I found myself outside a\r\ndoorless house. I went round and round it, but could find no entrance.\r\n\r\nI had stopped under one of the windows, on the point of calling aloud my\r\nrepentant confession, when a sudden wailing, howling scream invaded my\r\nears, and my heart stood still. Something sprang from the window above\r\nmy head, and lighted beyond me. I turned, and saw a large gray cat, its\r\nhair on end, shooting toward the river-bed. I fell with my face in the\r\nsand, and seemed to hear within the house the gentle sobbing of one who\r\nsuffered but did not repent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. A GRUESOME DANCE\r\n\r\nI rose to resume my journey, and walked many a desert mile. How I longed\r\nfor a mountain, or even a tall rock, from whose summit I might see\r\nacross the dismal plain or the dried-up channels to some bordering hope!\r\nYet what could such foresight have availed me? That which is within a\r\nman, not that which lies beyond his vision, is the main factor in what\r\nis about to befall him: the operation upon him is the event. Foreseeing\r\nis not understanding, else surely the prophecy latent in man would come\r\noftener to the surface!\r\n\r\nThe sun was half-way to the horizon when I saw before me a rugged rocky\r\nascent; but ere I reached it my desire to climb was over, and I longed\r\nto lie down. By that time the sun was almost set, and the air had begun\r\nto grow dark. At my feet lay a carpet of softest, greenest moss, couch\r\nfor a king: I threw myself upon it, and weariness at once began to ebb,\r\nfor, the moment my head was down, the third time I heard below me many\r\nwaters, playing broken airs and ethereal harmonies with the stones of\r\ntheir buried channels. Loveliest chaos of music-stuff the harp aquarian\r\nkept sending up to my ears! What might not a Haendel have done with that\r\never-recurring gurgle and bell-like drip, to the mingling and mutually\r\ndestructive melodies their common refrain!\r\n\r\nAs I lay listening, my eyes went wandering up and down the rocky slope\r\nabrupt above me, reading on its face the record that down there, ages\r\nago, rushed a cataract, filling the channels that had led me to its\r\nfoot. My heart swelled at the thought of the splendid tumult, where\r\nthe waves danced revelling in helpless fall, to mass their music in one\r\norgan-roar below. But soon the hidden brooks lulled me to sleep, and\r\ntheir lullabies mingled with my dreams.\r\n\r\nI woke before the sun, and eagerly climbed to see what lay beyond. Alas,\r\nnothing but a desert of finest sand! Not a trace was left of the river\r\nthat had plunged adown the rocks! The powdery drift had filled its\r\ncourse to the level of the dreary expanse! As I looked back I saw that\r\nthe river had divided into two branches as it fell, that whose bank I\r\nhad now followed to the foot of the rocky scaur, and that which first I\r\ncrossed to the Evil Wood. The wood I descried between the two on the\r\nfar horizon. Before me and to the left, the desert stretched beyond my\r\nvision, but far to the right I could see a lift in the sky-line, giving\r\nhope of the forest to which my hostess had directed me.\r\n\r\nI sat down, and sought in my pocket the half-loaf I had brought with\r\nme--then first to understand what my hostess had meant concerning it.\r\nVerily the bread was not for the morrow: it had shrunk and hardened to a\r\nstone! I threw it away, and set out again.\r\n\r\nAbout noon I came to a few tamarisk and juniper trees, and then to a few\r\nstunted firs. As I went on, closer thickets and larger firs met me, and\r\nat length I was in just such a forest of pines and other trees as that\r\nin which the Little Ones found their babies, and believed I had returned\r\nupon a farther portion of the same. But what mattered WHERE while\r\nEVERYWHERE was the same as NOWHERE! I had not yet, by doing something in\r\nit, made ANYWHERE into a place! I was not yet alive; I was only dreaming\r\nI lived! I was but a consciousness with an outlook! Truly I had been\r\nnothing else in the world I had left, but now I knew the fact! I said\r\nto myself that if in this forest I should catch the faint gleam of the\r\nmirror, I would turn far aside lest it should entrap me unawares, and\r\ngive me back to my old existence: here I might learn to be something by\r\ndoing something! I could not endure the thought of going back, with so\r\nmany beginnings and not an end achieved. The Little Ones would meet what\r\nfate was appointed them; the awful witch I should never meet; the dead\r\nwould ripen and arise without me; I should but wake to know that I had\r\ndreamed, and that all my going was nowhither! I would rather go on and\r\non than come to such a close!\r\n\r\nI went deeper into the wood: I was weary, and would rest in it.\r\n\r\nThe trees were now large, and stood in regular, almost geometric,\r\nfashion, with roomy spaces between. There was little undergrowth, and\r\nI could see a long way in every direction. The forest was like a great\r\nchurch, solemn and silent and empty, for I met nothing on two feet or\r\nfour that day. Now and then, it is true, some swift thing, and again\r\nsome slow thing, would cross the space on which my eye happened that\r\nmoment to settle; but it was always at some distance, and only enhanced\r\nthe sense of wideness and vacancy. I heard a few birds, and saw plenty\r\nof butterflies, some of marvellously gorgeous colouring and combinations\r\nof colour, some of a pure and dazzling whiteness.\r\n\r\nComing to a spot where the pines stood farther apart and gave room for\r\nflowering shrubs, and hoping it a sign of some dwelling near, I took the\r\ndirection where yet more and more roses grew, for I was hungry after the\r\nvoice and face of my kind--after any live soul, indeed, human or not,\r\nwhich I might in some measure understand. What a hell of horror, I\r\nthought, to wander alone, a bare existence never going out of itself,\r\nnever widening its life in another life, but, bound with the cords of\r\nits poor peculiarities, lying an eternal prisoner in the dungeon of its\r\nown being! I began to learn that it was impossible to live for oneself\r\neven, save in the presence of others--then, alas, fearfully possible!\r\nevil was only through good! selfishness but a parasite on the tree\r\nof life! In my own world I had the habit of solitary song; here not a\r\ncrooning murmur ever parted my lips! There I sang without thinking; here\r\nI thought without singing! there I had never had a bosom-friend; here\r\nthe affection of an idiot would be divinely welcome! "If only I had a\r\ndog to love!" I sighed--and regarded with wonder my past self, which\r\npreferred the company of book or pen to that of man or woman; which, if\r\nthe author of a tale I was enjoying appeared, would wish him away that I\r\nmight return to his story. I had chosen the dead rather than the living,\r\nthe thing thought rather than the thing thinking! "Any man," I said\r\nnow, "is more than the greatest of books!" I had not cared for my\r\nlive brothers and sisters, and now I was left without even the dead to\r\ncomfort me!\r\n\r\nThe wood thinned yet more, and the pines grew yet larger, sending up\r\nhuge stems, like columns eager to support the heavens. More trees of\r\nother kinds appeared; the forest was growing richer! The roses wore now\r\ntrees, and their flowers of astonishing splendour.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I spied what seemed a great house or castle; but its forms were\r\nso strangely indistinct, that I could not be certain it was more than a\r\nchance combination of tree-shapes. As I drew nearer, its lines yet held\r\ntogether, but neither they nor the body of it grew at all more definite;\r\nand when at length I stood in front of it, I remained as doubtful of its\r\nnature as before. House or castle habitable, it certainly was not; it\r\nmight be a ruin overgrown with ivy and roses! Yet of building hid in the\r\nfoliage, not the poorest wall-remnant could I discern. Again and again\r\nI seemed to descry what must be building, but it always vanished before\r\ncloser inspection. Could it be, I pondered, that the ivy had embraced a\r\nhuge edifice and consumed it, and its interlaced branches retained the\r\nshapes of the walls it had assimilated?--I could be sure of nothing\r\nconcerning the appearance.\r\n\r\nBefore me was a rectangular vacancy--the ghost of a doorway without a\r\ndoor: I stepped through it, and found myself in an open space like a\r\ngreat hall, its floor covered with grass and flowers, its walls and roof\r\nof ivy and vine, mingled with roses.\r\n\r\nThere could be no better place in which to pass the night! I gathered\r\na quantity of withered leaves, laid them in a corner, and threw myself\r\nupon them. A red sunset filled the hall, the night was warm, and my\r\ncouch restful; I lay gazing up at the live ceiling, with its tracery\r\nof branches and twigs, its clouds of foliage, and peeping patches of\r\nloftier roof. My eyes went wading about as if tangled in it, until the\r\nsun was down, and the sky beginning to grow dark. Then the red roses\r\nturned black, and soon the yellow and white alone were visible. When\r\nthey vanished, the stars came instead, hanging in the leaves like\r\nlive topazes, throbbing and sparkling and flashing many colours: I was\r\ncanopied with a tree from Aladdin\'s cave!\r\n\r\nThen I discovered that it was full of nests, whence tiny heads,\r\nnearly indistinguishable, kept popping out with a chirp or two, and\r\ndisappearing again. For a while there were rustlings and stirrings and\r\nlittle prayers; but as the darkness grew, the small heads became still,\r\nand at last every feathered mother had her brood quiet under her wings,\r\nthe talk in the little beds was over, and God\'s bird-nursery at rest\r\nbeneath the waves of sleep. Once more a few flutterings made me look\r\nup: an owl went sailing across. I had only a glimpse of him, but several\r\ntimes felt the cool wafture of his silent wings. The mother birds did\r\nnot move again; they saw that he was looking for mice, not children.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight I came wide awake, roused by a revelry, whose noises\r\nwere yet not loud. Neither were they distant; they were close to me, but\r\nattenuate. My eyes were so dazzled, however, that for a while I could\r\nsee nothing; at last they came to themselves.\r\n\r\nI was lying on my withered leaves in the corner of a splendid hall.\r\nBefore me was a crowd of gorgeously dressed men and gracefully robed\r\nwomen, none of whom seemed to see me. In dance after dance they vaguely\r\nembodied the story of life, its meetings, its passions, its partings. A\r\nstudent of Shakspere, I had learned something of every dance alluded\r\nto in his plays, and hence partially understood several of those I\r\nnow saw--the minuet, the pavin, the hey, the coranto, the lavolta. The\r\ndancers were attired in fashion as ancient as their dances.\r\n\r\nA moon had risen while I slept, and was shining through the\r\ncountless-windowed roof; but her light was crossed by so many shadows\r\nthat at first I could distinguish almost nothing of the faces of\r\nthe multitude; I could not fail, however, to perceive that there was\r\nsomething odd about them: I sat up to see them better.--Heavens! could\r\nI call them faces? They were skull fronts!--hard, gleaming bone, bare\r\njaws, truncated noses, lipless teeth which could no more take part in\r\nany smile! Of these, some flashed set and white and murderous; others\r\nwere clouded with decay, broken and gapped, coloured of the earth in\r\nwhich they seemed so long to have lain! Fearfuller yet, the eye-sockets\r\nwere not empty; in each was a lidless living eye! In those wrecks of\r\nfaces, glowed or flashed or sparkled eyes of every colour, shape, and\r\nexpression. The beautiful, proud eye, dark and lustrous, condescending\r\nto whatever it rested upon, was the more terrible; the lovely,\r\nlanguishing eye, the more repulsive; while the dim, sad eyes, less at\r\nvariance with their setting, were sad exceedingly, and drew the heart in\r\nspite of the horror out of which they gazed.\r\n\r\nI rose and went among the apparitions, eager to understand something\r\nof their being and belongings. Were they souls, or were they and their\r\nrhythmic motions but phantasms of what had been? By look nor by gesture,\r\nnot by slightest break in the measure, did they show themselves aware\r\nof me; I was not present to them: how much were they in relation to each\r\nother? Surely they saw their companions as I saw them! Or was each only\r\ndreaming itself and the rest? Did they know each how they appeared to\r\nthe others--a death with living eyes? Had they used their faces, not for\r\ncommunication, not to utter thought and feeling, not to share existence\r\nwith their neighbours, but to appear what they wished to appear, and\r\nconceal what they were? and, having made their faces masks, were they\r\ntherefore deprived of those masks, and condemned to go without faces\r\nuntil they repented?\r\n\r\n"How long must they flaunt their facelessness in faceless eyes?" I\r\nwondered. "How long will the frightful punition endure? Have they at\r\nlength begun to love and be wise? Have they yet yielded to the shame\r\nthat has found them?"\r\n\r\nI heard not a word, saw not a movement of one naked mouth. Were they\r\nbecause of lying bereft of speech? With their eyes they spoke as if\r\nlonging to be understood: was it truth or was it falsehood that spoke\r\nin their eyes? They seemed to know one another: did they see one skull\r\nbeautiful, and another plain? Difference must be there, and they had had\r\nlong study of skulls!\r\n\r\nMy body was to theirs no obstacle: was I a body, and were they but\r\nforms? or was I but a form, and were they bodies? The moment one of the\r\ndancers came close against me, that moment he or she was on the other\r\nside of me, and I could tell, without seeing, which, whether man or\r\nwoman, had passed through my house.\r\n\r\nOn many of the skulls the hair held its place, and however dressed, or\r\nin itself however beautiful, to my eyes looked frightful on the bones\r\nof the forehead and temples. In such case, the outer ear often remained\r\nalso, and at its tip, the jewel of the ear as Sidney calls it,\r\nwould hang, glimmering, gleaming, or sparkling, pearl or opal or\r\ndiamond--under the night of brown or of raven locks, the sunrise\r\nof golden ripples, or the moonshine of pale, interclouded, fluffy\r\ncirri--lichenous all on the ivory-white or damp-yellow naked bone. I\r\nlooked down and saw the daintily domed instep; I looked up and saw the\r\nplump shoulders basing the spring of the round full neck--which withered\r\nat half-height to the fluted shaft of a gibbose cranium.\r\n\r\nThe music became wilder, the dance faster and faster; eyes flared and\r\nflashed, jewels twinkled and glittered, casting colour and fire on the\r\npallid grins that glode through the hall, weaving a ghastly rhythmic\r\nwoof in intricate maze of multitudinous motion, when sudden came a\r\npause, and every eye turned to the same spot:--in the doorway stood a\r\nwoman, perfect in form, in holding, and in hue, regarding the company\r\nas from the pedestal of a goddess, while the dancers stood "like one\r\nforbid," frozen to a new death by the vision of a life that killed.\r\n"Dead things, I live!" said her scornful glance. Then, at once, like\r\nleaves in which an instant wind awakes, they turned each to another, and\r\nbroke afresh into melodious consorted motion, a new expression in\r\ntheir eyes, late solitary, now filled with the interchange of a common\r\ntriumph. "Thou also," they seemed to say, "wilt soon become weak as\r\nwe! thou wilt soon become like unto us!" I turned mine again to the\r\nwoman--and saw upon her side a small dark shadow.\r\n\r\nShe had seen the change in the dead stare; she looked down; she\r\nunderstood the talking eyes; she pressed both her lovely hands on the\r\nshadow, gave a smothered cry, and fled. The birds moved rustling in\r\ntheir nests, and a flash of joy lit up the eyes of the dancers, when\r\nsuddenly a warm wind, growing in strength as it swept through the place,\r\nblew out every light. But the low moon yet glimmered on the horizon with\r\n"sick assay" to shine, and a turbid radiance yet gleamed from so many\r\neyes, that I saw well enough what followed. As if each shape had been\r\nbut a snow-image, it began to fall to pieces, ruining in the warm wind.\r\nIn papery flakes the flesh peeled from its bones, dropping like soiled\r\nsnow from under its garments; these fell fluttering in rags and strips,\r\nand the whole white skeleton, emerging from garment and flesh together,\r\nstood bare and lank amid the decay that littered the floor. A faint\r\nrattling shiver went through the naked company; pair after pair\r\nthe lamping eyes went out; and the darkness grew round me with the\r\nloneliness. For a moment the leaves were still swept fluttering all one\r\nway; then the wind ceased, and the owl floated silent through the silent\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment had I been afraid. It is true that whoever would cross\r\nthe threshold of any world, must leave fear behind him; but, for myself,\r\nI could claim no part in its absence. No conscious courage was operant\r\nin me; simply, I was not afraid. I neither knew why I was not afraid,\r\nnor wherefore I might have been afraid. I feared not even fear--which of\r\nall dangers is the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nI went out into the wood, at once to resume my journey. Another moon was\r\nrising, and I turned my face toward it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. A GROTESQUE TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nI had not gone ten paces when I caught sight of a strange-looking\r\nobject, and went nearer to know what it might be. I found it a\r\nmouldering carriage of ancient form, ruinous but still upright on its\r\nheavy wheels. On each side of the pole, still in its place, lay the\r\nskeleton of a horse; from their two grim white heads ascended the\r\nshrivelled reins to the hand of the skeleton-coachman seated on his\r\ntattered hammer-cloth; both doors had fallen away; within sat two\r\nskeletons, each leaning back in its corner.\r\n\r\nEven as I looked, they started awake, and with a cracking rattle of\r\nbones, each leaped from the door next it. One fell and lay; the other\r\nstood a moment, its structure shaking perilously; then with difficulty,\r\nfor its joints were stiff, crept, holding by the back of the carriage,\r\nto the opposite side, the thin leg-bones seeming hardly strong enough to\r\ncarry its weight, where, kneeling by the other, it sought to raise it,\r\nalmost falling itself again in the endeavour.\r\n\r\nThe prostrate one rose at length, as by a sudden effort, to the sitting\r\nposture. For a few moments it turned its yellowish skull to this side\r\nand that; then, heedless of its neighbour, got upon its feet by grasping\r\nthe spokes of the hind wheel. Half erected thus, it stood with its back\r\nto the other, both hands holding one of its knee-joints. With little\r\nless difficulty and not a few contortions, the kneeling one rose next,\r\nand addressed its companion.\r\n\r\n"Have you hurt yourself, my lord?" it said, in a voice that sounded\r\nfar-off, and ill-articulated as if blown aside by some spectral wind.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have," answered the other, in like but rougher tone. "You would\r\ndo nothing to help me, and this cursed knee is out!"\r\n\r\n"I did my best, my lord."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, my lady, for it was bad! I thought I should never find my\r\nfeet again!--But, bless my soul, madam! are you out in your bones?"\r\n\r\nShe cast a look at herself.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing else to be out in," she returned; "--and YOU at least\r\ncannot complain! But what on earth does it mean? Am I dreaming?"\r\n\r\n"YOU may be dreaming, madam--I cannot tell; but this knee of mine\r\nforbids me the grateful illusion.--Ha! I too, I perceive, have nothing\r\nto walk in but bones!--Not so unbecoming to a man, however! I trust to\r\ngoodness they are not MY bones! every one aches worse than another, and\r\nthis loose knee worst of all! The bed must have been damp--and I too\r\ndrunk to know it!"\r\n\r\n"Probably, my lord of Cokayne!"\r\n\r\n"What! what!--You make me think I too am dreaming--aches and all! How\r\ndo YOU know the title my roistering bullies give me? I don\'t remember\r\nyou!--Anyhow, you have no right to take liberties! My name is--I am\r\nlord----tut, tut! What do you call me when I\'m--I mean when you are\r\nsober? I cannot--at the moment,--Why, what IS my name?--I must have been\r\nVERY drunk when I went to bed! I often am!"\r\n\r\n"You come so seldom to mine, that I do not know, my lord; but I may take\r\nyour word for THAT!"\r\n\r\n"I hope so!"\r\n\r\n"--if for nothing else!" "Hoity toity! I never told you a lie in my\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n"You never told me anything but lies."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour!--Why, I never saw the woman before!"\r\n\r\n"You knew me well enough to lie to, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"I do seem to begin to dream I have met you before, but, upon my oath,\r\nthere is nothing to know you by! Out of your clothes, who is to tell\r\nwho you may not be?--One thing I MAY swear--that I never saw you so much\r\nundressed before!--By heaven, I have no recollection of you!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it: my recollections of you are the less\r\ndistasteful!--Good morning, my lord!"\r\n\r\nShe turned away, hobbled, clacking, a few paces, and stood again.\r\n\r\n"You are just as heartless as--as--any other woman, madam!--Where in\r\nthis hell of a place shall I find my valet?--What was the cursed name I\r\nused to call the fool?"\r\n\r\nHe turned his bare noddle this way and that on its creaking pivot, still\r\nholding his knee with both hands.\r\n\r\n"I will be your valet for once, my lord," said the lady, turning once\r\nmore to him. "--What can I do for you? It is not easy to tell!"\r\n\r\n"Tie my leg on, of course, you fool! Can\'t you see it is all but off?\r\nHeigho, my dancing days!"\r\n\r\nShe looked about with her eyeless sockets and found a piece of fibrous\r\ngrass, with which she proceeded to bind together the adjoining parts\r\nthat had formed the knee. When she had done, he gave one or two\r\ncarefully tentative stamps.\r\n\r\n"You used to stamp rather differently, my lord!" she said, as she rose\r\nfrom her knees.\r\n\r\n"Eh? what!--Now I look at you again, it seems to me I used to hate\r\nyou!--Eh?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally, my lord! You hated a good many people!--your wife, of\r\ncourse, among the rest!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I begin, I be-gin---- But--I must have been a long time\r\nsomewhere!--I really forget!--There! your damned, miserable bit of grass\r\nis breaking!--We used to get on PRETTY well together--eh?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I remember, my lord. The only happy moments I had in your\r\ncompany were scattered over the first week of our marriage."\r\n\r\n"Was that the way of it? Ha! ha!--Well, it\'s over now, thank goodness!"\r\n\r\n"I wish I could believe it! Why were we sitting there in that carriage\r\ntogether? It wakes apprehension!"\r\n\r\n"I think we were divorced, my lady!"\r\n\r\n"Hardly enough: we are still together!"\r\n\r\n"A sad truth, but capable of remedy: the forest seems of some extent!"\r\n\r\n"I doubt! I doubt!"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I cannot think of a compliment to pay you--without lying,\r\nthat is. To judge by your figure and complexion you have lived hard\r\nsince I saw you last! I cannot surely be QUITE so naked as your\r\nladyship!--I beg your pardon, madam! I trust you will take it I am\r\nbut jesting in a dream! It is of no consequence, however; dreaming\r\nor waking, all\'s one--all merest appearance! You can\'t be certain of\r\nanything, and that\'s as good as knowing there is nothing! Life may teach\r\nany fool that!"\r\n\r\n"It has taught me the fool I was to love you!"\r\n\r\n"You were not the only fool to do that! Women had a trick of falling in\r\nlove with me:--I had forgotten that you were one of them!" "I did love\r\nyou, my lord--a little--at one time!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, there was your mistake, my lady! You should have loved me much,\r\nloved me devotedly, loved me savagely--loved me eternally! Then I should\r\nhave tired of you the sooner, and not hated you so much afterward!--But\r\nlet bygones be bygones!--WHERE are we? Locality is the question! To be\r\nor not to be, is NOT the question!"\r\n\r\n"We are in the other world, I presume!"\r\n\r\n"Granted!--but in which or what sort of other world? This can\'t be\r\nhell!"\r\n\r\n"It must: there\'s marriage in it! You and I are damned in each other."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m not like Othello, damned in a fair wife!--Oh, I remember my\r\nShakspeare, madam!"\r\n\r\nShe picked up a broken branch that had fallen into a bush, and steadying\r\nherself with it, walked away, tossing her little skull.\r\n\r\n"Give that stick to me," cried her late husband; "I want it more than\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nShe returned him no answer.\r\n\r\n"You mean to make me beg for it?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, my lord. I mean to keep it," she replied, continuing her\r\nslow departure.\r\n\r\n"Give it me at once; I mean to have it! I require it."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, I think I require it myself!" returned the lady, walking\r\na little quicker, with a sharper cracking of her joints and clinking of\r\nher bones.\r\n\r\nHe started to follow her, but nearly fell: his knee-grass had burst, and\r\nwith an oath he stopped, grasping his leg again.\r\n\r\n"Come and tie it up properly!" he would have thundered, but he only\r\npiped and whistled!\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"Come and tie it up instantly!" he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe walked a step or two farther from him.\r\n\r\n"I swear I will not touch you!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Swear on, my lord! there is no one here to believe you. But, pray, do\r\nnot lose your temper, or you will shake yourself to pieces, and where to\r\nfind string enough to tie up all your crazy joints, is more than I can\r\ntell."\r\n\r\nShe came back, and knelt once more at his side--first, however, laying\r\nthe stick in dispute beyond his reach and within her own.\r\n\r\nThe instant she had finished retying the joint, he made a grab at her,\r\nthinking, apparently, to seize her by the hair; but his hard fingers\r\nslipped on the smooth poll.\r\n\r\n"Disgusting!" he muttered, and laid hold of her upper arm-bone.\r\n\r\n"You will break it!" she said, looking up from her knees.\r\n\r\n"I will, then!" he answered, and began to strain at it.\r\n\r\n"I shall not tie your leg again the next time it comes loose!" she\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nHe gave her arm a vicious twist, but happily her bones were in better\r\ncondition than his. She stretched her other hand toward the broken\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right: reach me the stick!" he grinned.\r\n\r\nShe brought it round with such a swing that one of the bones of the\r\nsounder leg snapped. He fell, choking with curses. The lady laughed.\r\n\r\n"Now you will have to wear splints always!" she said; "such dry bones\r\nnever mend!"\r\n\r\n"You devil!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"At your service, my lord! Shall I fetch you a couple of wheel-spokes?\r\nNeat--but heavy, I fear!"\r\n\r\nHe turned his bone-face aside, and did not answer, but lay and groaned.\r\nI marvelled he had not gone to pieces when he fell. The lady rose and\r\nwalked away--not all ungracefully, I thought.\r\n\r\n"What can come of it?" I said to myself. "These are too wretched for any\r\nworld, and this cannot be hell, for the Little Ones are in it, and\r\nthe sleepers too! What can it all mean? Can things ever come right for\r\nskeletons?"\r\n\r\n"There are words too big for you and me: ALL is one of them, and EVER is\r\nanother," said a voice near me which I knew.\r\n\r\nI looked about, but could not see the speaker.\r\n\r\n"You are not in hell," it resumed. "Neither am I in hell. But those\r\nskeletons are in hell!"\r\n\r\nEre he ended I caught sight of the raven on the bough of a beech, right\r\nover my head. The same moment he left it, and alighting on the ground,\r\nstood there, the thin old man of the library, with long nose and long\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n"The male was never a gentleman," he went on, "and in the bony stage\r\nof retrogression, with his skeleton through his skin, and his character\r\noutside his manners, does not look like one. The female is less vulgar,\r\nand has a little heart. But, the restraints of society removed, you see\r\nthem now just as they are and always were!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mr. Raven, what will become of them," I said.\r\n\r\n"We shall see," he replied. "In their day they were the handsomest\r\ncouple at court; and now, even in their dry bones, they seem to regard\r\ntheir former repute as an inalienable possession; to see their faces,\r\nhowever, may yet do something for them! They felt themselves rich too\r\nwhile they had pockets, but they have already begun to feel rather\r\npinched! My lord used to regard my lady as a worthless encumbrance, for\r\nhe was tired of her beauty and had spent her money; now he needs her\r\nto cobble his joints for him! These changes have roots of hope in them.\r\nBesides, they cannot now get far away from each other, and they see none\r\nelse of their own kind: they must at last grow weary of their mutual\r\nrepugnance, and begin to love one another! for love, not hate, is\r\ndeepest in what Love \'loved into being.\'"\r\n\r\n"I saw many more of their kind an hour ago, in the hall close by!" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Of their kind, but not of their sort," he answered. "For many years\r\nthese will see none such as you saw last night. Those are centuries\r\nin advance of these. You saw that those could even dress themselves a\r\nlittle! It is true they cannot yet retain their clothes so long as they\r\nwould--only, at present, for a part of the night; but they are pretty\r\nsteadily growing more capable, and will by and by develop faces; for\r\nevery grain of truthfulness adds a fibre to the show of their humanity.\r\nNothing but truth can appear; and whatever is must seem."\r\n\r\n"Are they upheld by this hope?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"They are upheld by hope, but they do not in the least know their hope;\r\nto understand it, is yet immeasurably beyond them," answered Mr. Raven.\r\n\r\nHis unexpected appearance had caused me no astonishment. I was like a\r\nchild, constantly wondering, and surprised at nothing.\r\n\r\n"Did you come to find me, sir?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," he replied. "I have no anxiety about you. Such as you\r\nalways come back to us."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, please, who am I such as?" I said.\r\n\r\n"I cannot make my friend the subject of conversation," he answered, with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n"But when that friend is present!" I urged.\r\n\r\n"I decline the more strongly," he rejoined.\r\n\r\n"But when that friend asks you!" I persisted.\r\n\r\n"Then most positively I refuse," he returned.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because he and I would be talking of two persons as if they were one\r\nand the same. Your consciousness of yourself and my knowledge of you are\r\nfar apart!"\r\n\r\nThe lapels of his coat flew out, and the lappets lifted, and I thought\r\nthe metamorphosis of HOMO to CORVUS was about to take place before my\r\neyes. But the coat closed again in front of him, and he added, with\r\nseeming inconsequence,\r\n\r\n"In this world never trust a person who has once deceived you. Above\r\nall, never do anything such a one may ask you to do."\r\n\r\n"I will try to remember," I answered; "--but I may forget!"\r\n\r\n"Then some evil that is good for you will follow."\r\n\r\n"And if I remember?"\r\n\r\n"Some evil that is not good for you, will not follow."\r\n\r\nThe old man seemed to sink to the ground, and immediately I saw the\r\nraven several yards from me, flying low and fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. DEAD OR ALIVE?\r\n\r\nI went walking on, still facing the moon, who, not yet high, was staring\r\nstraight into the forest. I did not know what ailed her, but she\r\nwas dark and dented, like a battered disc of old copper, and looked\r\ndispirited and weary. Not a cloud was nigh to keep her company, and the\r\nstars were too bright for her. "Is this going to last for ever?" she\r\nseemed to say. She was going one way and I was going the other, yet\r\nthrough the wood we went a long way together. We did not commune much,\r\nfor my eyes were on the ground; but her disconsolate look was fixed on\r\nme: I felt without seeing it. A long time we were together, I and the\r\nmoon, walking side by side, she the dull shine, and I the live shadow.\r\n\r\nSomething on the ground, under a spreading tree, caught my eye with its\r\nwhiteness, and I turned toward it. Vague as it was in the shadow of\r\nthe foliage, it suggested, as I drew nearer, a human body. "Another\r\nskeleton!" I said to myself, kneeling and laying my hand upon it. A body\r\nit was, however, and no skeleton, though as nearly one as body could\r\nwell be. It lay on its side, and was very cold--not cold like a stone,\r\nbut cold like that which was once alive, and is alive no more. The\r\ncloser I looked at it, the oftener I touched it, the less it seemed\r\npossible it should be other than dead. For one bewildered moment, I\r\nfancied it one of the wild dancers, a ghostly Cinderella, perhaps,\r\nthat had lost her way home, and perished in the strange night of an\r\nout-of-door world! It was quite naked, and so worn that, even in the\r\nshadow, I could, peering close, have counted without touching them,\r\nevery rib in its side. All its bones, indeed, were as visible as if\r\ntight-covered with only a thin elastic leather. Its beautiful yet\r\nterrible teeth, unseemly disclosed by the retracted lips, gleamed\r\nghastly through the dark. Its hair was longer than itself, thick and\r\nvery fine to the touch, and black as night.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of a tall, probably graceful woman.--How had she come\r\nthere? Not of herself, and already in such wasted condition, surely! Her\r\nstrength must have failed her; she had fallen, and lain there until she\r\ndied of hunger! But how, even so, could she be thus emaciated? And how\r\ncame she to be naked? Where were the savages to strip and leave her?\r\nor what wild beasts would have taken her garments? That her body should\r\nhave been left was not wonderful!\r\n\r\nI rose to my feet, stood, and considered. I must not, could not let her\r\nlie exposed and forsaken! Natural reverence forbade it. Even the\r\ngarment of a woman claims respect; her body it were impossible to leave\r\nuncovered! Irreverent eyes might look on it! Brutal claws might toss\r\nit about! Years would pass ere the friendly rains washed it into the\r\nsoil!--But the ground was hard, almost solid with interlacing roots, and\r\nI had but my bare hands!\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed plain that she had not long been dead: there was not\r\na sign of decay about her! But then what had the slow wasting of life\r\nleft of her to decay?\r\n\r\nCould she be still alive? Might she not? What if she were! Things went\r\nvery strangely in this strange world! Even then there would be little\r\nchance of bringing her back, but I must know she was dead before I\r\nburied her!\r\n\r\nAs I left the forest-hall, I had spied in the doorway a bunch of ripe\r\ngrapes, and brought it with me, eating as I came: a few were yet left on\r\nthe stalk, and their juice might possibly revive her! Anyhow it was all\r\nI had with which to attempt her rescue! The mouth was happily a little\r\nopen; but the head was in such an awkward position that, to move the\r\nbody, I passed my arm under the shoulder on which it lay, when I found\r\nthe pine-needles beneath it warm: she could not have been any time dead,\r\nand MIGHT still be alive, though I could discern no motion of the heart,\r\nor any indication that she breathed! One of her hands was clenched hard,\r\napparently inclosing something small. I squeezed a grape into her mouth,\r\nbut no swallowing followed.\r\n\r\nTo do for her all I could, I spread a thick layer of pine-needles and\r\ndry leaves, laid one of my garments over it, warm from my body, lifted\r\nher upon it, and covered her with my clothes and a great heap of leaves:\r\nI would save the little warmth left in her, hoping an increase to it\r\nwhen the sun came back. Then I tried another grape, but could perceive\r\nno slightest movement of mouth or throat.\r\n\r\n"Doubt," I said to myself, "may be a poor encouragement to do anything,\r\nbut it is a bad reason for doing nothing." So tight was the skin upon\r\nher bones that I dared not use friction.\r\n\r\nI crept into the heap of leaves, got as close to her as I could, and\r\ntook her in my arms. I had not much heat left in me, but what I had\r\nI would share with her! Thus I spent what remained of the night,\r\nsleepless, and longing for the sun. Her cold seemed to radiate into me,\r\nbut no heat to pass from me to her.\r\n\r\nHad I fled from the beautiful sleepers, I thought, each on her "dim,\r\nstraight" silver couch, to lie alone with such a bedfellow! I had\r\nrefused a lovely privilege: I was given over to an awful duty! Beneath\r\nthe sad, slow-setting moon, I lay with the dead, and watched for the\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nThe darkness had given way, and the eastern horizon was growing dimly\r\nclearer, when I caught sight of a motion rather than of anything\r\nthat moved--not far from me, and close to the ground. It was the low\r\nundulating of a large snake, which passed me in an unswerving line.\r\nPresently appeared, making as it seemed for the same point, what I took\r\nfor a roebuck-doe and her calf. Again a while, and two creatures like\r\nbear-cubs came, with three or four smaller ones behind them. The light\r\nwas now growing so rapidly that when, a few minutes after, a troop of\r\nhorses went trotting past, I could see that, although the largest of\r\nthem were no bigger than the smallest Shetland pony, they must yet be\r\nfull-grown, so perfect were they in form, and so much had they all the\r\nways and action of great horses. They were of many breeds. Some seemed\r\nmodels of cart-horses, others of chargers, hunters, racers. Dwarf cattle\r\nand small elephants followed.\r\n\r\n"Why are the children not here!" I said to myself. "The moment I am free\r\nof this poor woman, I must go back and fetch them!"\r\n\r\nWhere were the creatures going? What drew them? Was this an exodus, or\r\na morning habit? I must wait for the sun! Till he came I must not leave\r\nthe woman! I laid my hand on the body, and could not help thinking it\r\nfelt a trifle warmer. It might have gained a little of the heat I had\r\nlost! it could hardly have generated any! What reason for hope there was\r\nhad not grown less!\r\n\r\nThe forehead of the day began to glow, and soon the sun came peering up,\r\nas if to see for the first time what all this stir of a new world was\r\nabout. At sight of his great innocent splendour, I rose full of life,\r\nstrong against death. Removing the handkerchief I had put to protect the\r\nmouth and eyes from the pine-needles, I looked anxiously to see whether\r\nI had found a priceless jewel, or but its empty case.\r\n\r\nThe body lay motionless as when I found it. Then first, in the morning\r\nlight, I saw how drawn and hollow was the face, how sharp were the bones\r\nunder the skin, how every tooth shaped itself through the lips. The\r\nhuman garment was indeed worn to its threads, but the bird of heaven\r\nmight yet be nestling within, might yet awake to motion and song!\r\n\r\nBut the sun was shining on her face! I re-arranged the handkerchief,\r\nlaid a few leaves lightly over it, and set out to follow the creatures.\r\nTheir main track was well beaten, and must have long been used--likewise\r\nmany of the tracks that, joining it from both sides, merged in, and\r\nbroadened it. The trees retreated as I went, and the grass grew thicker.\r\nPresently the forest was gone, and a wide expanse of loveliest green\r\nstretched away to the horizon. Through it, along the edge of the forest,\r\nflowed a small river, and to this the track led. At sight of the water a\r\nnew though undefined hope sprang up in me. The stream looked everywhere\r\ndeep, and was full to the brim, but nowhere more than a few yards wide.\r\nA bluish mist rose from it, vanishing as it rose. On the opposite side,\r\nin the plentiful grass, many small animals were feeding. Apparently they\r\nslept in the forest, and in the morning sought the plain, swimming the\r\nriver to reach it. I knelt and would have drunk, but the water was hot,\r\nand had a strange metallic taste.\r\n\r\nI leapt to my feet: here was the warmth I sought--the first necessity of\r\nlife! I sped back to my helpless charge.\r\n\r\nWithout well considering my solitude, no one will understand what seemed\r\nto lie for me in the redemption of this woman from death. "Prove what\r\nshe may," I thought with myself, "I shall at least be lonely no more!" I\r\nhad found myself such poor company that now first I seemed to know what\r\nhope was. This blessed water would expel the cold death, and drown my\r\ndesolation!\r\n\r\nI bore her to the stream. Tall as she was, I found her marvellously\r\nlight, her bones were so delicate, and so little covered them. I grew\r\nyet more hopeful when I found her so far from stiff that I could carry\r\nher on one arm, like a sleeping child, leaning against my shoulder. I\r\nwent softly, dreading even the wind of my motion, and glad there was no\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe water was too hot to lay her at once in it: the shock might scare\r\nfrom her the yet fluttering life! I laid her on the bank, and dipping\r\none of my garments, began to bathe the pitiful form. So wasted was it\r\nthat, save from the plentifulness and blackness of the hair, it was\r\nimpossible even to conjecture whether she was young or old. Her eyelids\r\nwere just not shut, which made her look dead the more: there was a crack\r\nin the clouds of her night, at which no sun shone through!\r\n\r\nThe longer I went on bathing the poor bones, the less grew my hope that\r\nthey would ever again be clothed with strength, that ever those eyelids\r\nwould lift, and a soul look out; still I kept bathing continuously,\r\nallowing no part time to grow cold while I bathed another; and gradually\r\nthe body became so much warmer, that at last I ventured to submerge it:\r\nI got into the stream and drew it in, holding the face above the water,\r\nand letting the swift, steady current flow all about the rest. I noted,\r\nbut was able to conclude nothing from the fact, that, for all the heat,\r\nthe shut hand never relaxed its hold.\r\n\r\nAfter about ten minutes, I lifted it out and laid it again on the bank,\r\ndried it, and covered it as well as I could, then ran to the forest for\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe grass and soil were dry and warm; and when I returned I thought it\r\nhad scarcely lost any of the heat the water had given it. I spread the\r\nleaves upon it, and ran for more--then for a third and a fourth freight.\r\n\r\nI could now leave it and go to explore, in the hope of discovering\r\nsome shelter. I ran up the stream toward some rocky hills I saw in that\r\ndirection, which were not far off.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached them, I found the river issuing full grown from a rock\r\nat the bottom of one of them. To my fancy it seemed to have run down a\r\nstair inside, an eager cataract, at every landing wild to get out, but\r\nonly at the foot finding a door of escape.\r\n\r\nIt did not fill the opening whence it rushed, and I crept through into a\r\nlittle cave, where I learned that, instead of hurrying tumultuously down\r\na stair, it rose quietly from the ground at the back like the base of\r\na large column, and ran along one side, nearly filling a deep, rather\r\nnarrow channel. I considered the place, and saw that, if I could find\r\na few fallen boughs long enough to lie across the channel, and large\r\nenough to bear a little weight without bending much, I might, with\r\nsmaller branches and plenty of leaves, make upon them a comfortable\r\ncouch, which the stream under would keep constantly warm. Then I ran\r\nback to see how my charge fared.\r\n\r\nShe was lying as I had left her. The heat had not brought her to life,\r\nbut neither had it developed anything to check farther hope. I got a few\r\nboulders out of the channel, and arranged them at her feet and on both\r\nsides of her.\r\n\r\nRunning again to the wood, I had not to search long ere I found some\r\nsmall boughs fit for my purpose--mostly of beech, their dry yellow\r\nleaves yet clinging to them. With these I had soon laid the floor of a\r\nbridge-bed over the torrent. I crossed the boughs with smaller branches,\r\ninterlaced these with twigs, and buried all deep in leaves and dry moss.\r\n\r\nWhen thus at length, after not a few journeys to the forest, I had\r\ncompleted a warm, dry, soft couch, I took the body once more, and set\r\nout with it for the cave. It was so light that now and then as I went\r\nI almost feared lest, when I laid it down, I should find it a skeleton\r\nafter all; and when at last I did lay it gently on the pathless bridge,\r\nit was a greater relief to part with that fancy than with the weight.\r\nOnce more I covered the body with a thick layer of leaves; and trying\r\nagain to feed her with a grape, found to my joy that I could open the\r\nmouth a little farther. The grape, indeed, lay in it unheeded, but I\r\nhoped some of the juice might find its way down.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or two on the couch, she was no longer cold. The warmth of\r\nthe brook had interpenetrated her frame--truly it was but a frame!--and\r\nshe was warm to the touch;--not, probably, with the warmth of life, but\r\nwith a warmth which rendered it more possible, if she were alive, that\r\nshe might live. I had read of one in a trance lying motionless for\r\nweeks!\r\n\r\nIn that cave, day after day, night after night, seven long days and\r\nnights, I sat or lay, now waking now sleeping, but always watching.\r\nEvery morning I went out and bathed in the hot stream, and every morning\r\nfelt thereupon as if I had eaten and drunk--which experience gave me\r\ncourage to lay her in it also every day.  Once as I did so, a shadow of\r\ndiscoloration on her left side gave me a terrible shock, but the next\r\nmorning it had vanished, and I continued the treatment--every morning,\r\nafter her bath, putting a fresh grape in her mouth.\r\n\r\nI too ate of the grapes and other berries I found in the forest; but I\r\nbelieved that, with my daily bath in that river, I could have done very\r\nwell without eating at all.\r\n\r\nEvery time I slept, I dreamed of finding a wounded angel, who, unable to\r\nfly, remained with me until at last she loved me and would not leave me;\r\nand every time I woke, it was to see, instead of an angel-visage with\r\nlustrous eyes, the white, motionless, wasted face upon the couch. But\r\nAdam himself, when first he saw her asleep, could not have looked more\r\nanxiously for Eve\'s awaking than I watched for this woman\'s. Adam knew\r\nnothing of himself, perhaps nothing of his need of another self; I, an\r\nalien from my fellows, had learned to love what I had lost! Were this\r\none wasted shred of womanhood to disappear, I should have nothing in me\r\nbut a consuming hunger after life! I forgot even the Little Ones: things\r\nwere not amiss with them! here lay what might wake and be a woman! might\r\nactually open eyes, and look out of them upon me!\r\n\r\nNow first I knew what solitude meant--now that I gazed on one who\r\nneither saw nor heard, neither moved nor spoke. I saw now that a man\r\nalone is but a being that may become a man--that he is but a need, and\r\ntherefore a possibility. To be enough for himself, a being must be\r\nan eternal, self-existent worm! So superbly constituted, so simply\r\ncomplicate is man; he rises from and stands upon such a pedestal of\r\nlower physical organisms and spiritual structures, that no atmosphere\r\nwill comfort or nourish his life, less divine than that offered by other\r\nsouls; nowhere but in other lives can he breathe. Only by the reflex of\r\nother lives can he ripen his specialty, develop the idea of himself,\r\nthe individuality that distinguishes him from every other. Were all men\r\nalike, each would still have an individuality, secured by his personal\r\nconsciousness, but there would be small reason why there should be more\r\nthan two or three such; while, for the development of the differences\r\nwhich make a large and lofty unity possible, and which alone can\r\nmake millions into a church, an endless and measureless influence and\r\nreaction are indispensable. A man to be perfect--complete, that is,\r\nin having reached the spiritual condition of persistent and universal\r\ngrowth, which is the mode wherein he inherits the infinitude of his\r\nFather--must have the education of a world of fellow-men. Save for the\r\nhope of the dawn of life in the form beside me, I should have fled for\r\nfellowship to the beasts that grazed and did not speak. Better to go\r\nabout with them--infinitely better--than to live alone! But with the\r\nfaintest prospect of a woman to my friend, I, poorest of creatures, was\r\nyet a possible man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. THE WHITE LEECH\r\n\r\nI woke one morning from a profound sleep, with one of my hands very\r\npainful. The back of it was much swollen, and in the centre of the\r\nswelling was a triangular wound, like the bite of a leech. As the day\r\nwent on, the swelling subsided, and by the evening the hurt was all but\r\nhealed. I searched the cave, turning over every stone of any size, but\r\ndiscovered nothing I could imagine capable of injuring me.\r\n\r\nSlowly the days passed, and still the body never moved, never opened\r\nits eyes. It could not be dead, for assuredly it manifested no sign of\r\ndecay, and the air about it was quite pure. Moreover, I could imagine\r\nthat the sharpest angles of the bones had begun to disappear, that\r\nthe form was everywhere a little rounder, and the skin had less of the\r\nparchment-look: if such change was indeed there, life must be there! the\r\ntide which had ebbed so far toward the infinite, must have begun again\r\nto flow! Oh joy to me, if the rising ripples of life\'s ocean were indeed\r\nburying under lovely shape the bones it had all but forsaken! Twenty\r\ntimes a day I looked for evidence of progress, and twenty times a day I\r\ndoubted--sometimes even despaired; but the moment I recalled the mental\r\npicture of her as I found her, hope revived.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks had passed thus, when one night, after lying a long time\r\nawake, I rose, thinking to go out and breathe the cooler air; for,\r\nalthough from the running of the stream it was always fresh in the cave,\r\nthe heat was not seldom a little oppressive. The moon outside was full,\r\nthe air within shadowy clear, and naturally I cast a lingering look on\r\nmy treasure ere I went. "Bliss eternal!" I cried aloud, "do I see her\r\neyes?" Great orbs, dark as if cut from the sphere of a starless night,\r\nand luminous by excess of darkness, seemed to shine amid the glimmering\r\nwhiteness of her face. I stole nearer, my heart beating so that I feared\r\nthe noise of it startling her. I bent over her. Alas, her eyelids were\r\nclose shut! Hope and Imagination had wrought mutual illusion! my heart\'s\r\ndesire would never be! I turned away, threw myself on the floor of the\r\ncave, and wept. Then I bethought me that her eyes had been a little\r\nopen, and that now the awful chink out of which nothingness had peered,\r\nwas gone: it might be that she had opened them for a moment, and was\r\nagain asleep!--it might be she was awake and holding them close! In\r\neither case, life, less or more, must have shut them! I was comforted,\r\nand fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThat night I was again bitten, and awoke with a burning thirst.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I searched yet more thoroughly, but again in vain. The\r\nwound was of the same character, and, as before, was nearly well by the\r\nevening. I concluded that some large creature of the leech kind came\r\noccasionally from the hot stream. "But, if blood be its object," I said\r\nto myself, "so long as I am there, I need hardly fear for my treasure!"\r\n\r\nThat same morning, when, having peeled a grape as usual and taken away\r\nthe seeds, I put it in her mouth, her lips made a slight movement of\r\nreception, and I KNEW she lived!\r\n\r\nMy hope was now so much stronger that I began to think of some attire\r\nfor her: she must be able to rise the moment she wished! I betook myself\r\ntherefore to the forest, to investigate what material it might afford,\r\nand had hardly begun to look when fibrous skeletons, like those of the\r\nleaves of the prickly pear, suggested themselves as fit for the purpose.\r\nI gathered a stock of them, laid them to dry in the sun, pulled apart\r\nthe reticulated layers, and of these had soon begun to fashion two loose\r\ngarments, one to hang from her waist, the other from her shoulders.\r\nWith the stiletto-point of an aloe-leaf and various filaments, I sewed\r\ntogether three thicknesses of the tissue.\r\n\r\nDuring the week that followed, there was no farther sign except that she\r\nmore evidently took the grapes. But indeed all the signs became surer:\r\nplainly she was growing plumper, and her skin fairer. Still she did not\r\nopen her eyes; and the horrid fear would at times invade me, that her\r\ngrowth was of some hideous fungoid nature, the few grapes being nowise\r\nsufficient to account for it.\r\n\r\nAgain I was bitten; and now the thing, whatever it was, began to pay me\r\nregular visits at intervals of three days. It now generally bit me in\r\nthe neck or the arm, invariably with but one bite, always while I slept,\r\nand never, even when I slept, in the daytime. Hour after hour would I\r\nlie awake on the watch, but never heard it coming, or saw sign of its\r\napproach. Neither, I believe, did I ever feel it bite me. At length\r\nI became so hopeless of catching it, that I no longer troubled myself\r\neither to look for it by day, or lie in wait for it at night. I knew\r\nfrom my growing weakness that I was losing blood at a dangerous rate,\r\nbut I cared little for that: in sight of my eyes death was yielding to\r\nlife; a soul was gathering strength to save me from loneliness; we would\r\ngo away together, and I should speedily recover!\r\n\r\nThe garments were at length finished, and, contemplating my handiwork\r\nwith no small satisfaction, I proceeded to mat layers of the fibre into\r\nsandals.\r\n\r\nOne night I woke suddenly, breathless and faint, and longing after air,\r\nand had risen to crawl from the cave, when a slight rustle in the leaves\r\nof the couch set me listening motionless.\r\n\r\n"I caught the vile thing," said a feeble voice, in my mother-tongue; "I\r\ncaught it in the very act!"\r\n\r\nShe was alive! she spoke! I dared not yield to my transport lest I\r\nshould terrify her.\r\n\r\n"What creature?" I breathed, rather than said.\r\n\r\n"The creature," she answered, "that was biting you."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"A great white leech."\r\n\r\n"How big?" I pursued, forcing myself to be calm.\r\n\r\n"Not far from six feet long, I should think," she answered.\r\n\r\n"You have saved my life, perhaps!--But how could you touch the horrid\r\nthing! How brave of you!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"I did!" was all her answer, and I thought she shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Where is it? What could you do with such a monster?"\r\n\r\n"I threw it in the river."\r\n\r\n"Then it will come again, I fear!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think I could have killed it, even had I known how!--I heard\r\nyou moaning, and got up to see what disturbed you; saw the frightful\r\nthing at your neck, and pulled it away. But I could not hold it, and was\r\nhardly able to throw it from me. I only heard it splash in the water!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll kill it next time!" I said; but with that I turned faint, sought\r\nthe open air, but fell.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself the sun was up. The lady stood a little way off,\r\nlooking, even in the clumsy attire I had fashioned for her, at once\r\ngrand and graceful. I HAD seen those glorious eyes! Through the night\r\nthey had shone! Dark as the darkness primeval, they now outshone the\r\nday! She stood erect as a column, regarding me. Her pale cheek indicated\r\nno emotion, only question. I rose.\r\n\r\n"We must be going!" I said. "The white leech----"\r\n\r\nI stopped: a strange smile had flickered over her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n"Did you find me there?" she asked, pointing to the cave.\r\n\r\n"No; I brought you there," I replied.\r\n\r\n"You brought me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"From where?"\r\n\r\n"From the forest."\r\n\r\n"What have you done with my clothes--and my jewels?"\r\n\r\n"You had none when I found you."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you not leave me?"\r\n\r\n"Because I hoped you were not dead."\r\n\r\n"Why should you have cared?"\r\n\r\n"Because I was very lonely, and wanted you to live."\r\n\r\n"You would have kept me enchanted for my beauty!" she said, with proud\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\nHer words and her look roused my indignation.\r\n\r\n"There was no beauty left in you," I said.\r\n\r\n"Why, then, again, did you not let me alone?"\r\n\r\n"Because you were of my own kind."\r\n\r\n"Of YOUR kind?" she cried, in a tone of utter contempt.\r\n\r\n"I thought so, but find I was mistaken!"\r\n\r\n"Doubtless you pitied me!"\r\n\r\n"Never had woman more claim on pity, or less on any other feeling!"\r\n\r\nWith an expression of pain, mortification, and anger unutterable, she\r\nturned from me and stood silent. Starless night lay profound in the\r\ngulfs of her eyes: hate of him who brought it back had slain their\r\nsplendour. The light of life was gone from them.\r\n\r\n"Had you failed to rouse me, what would you have done?" she asked\r\nsuddenly without moving.\r\n\r\n"I would have buried it."\r\n\r\n"It! What?--You would have buried THIS?" she exclaimed, flashing round\r\nupon me in a white fury, her arms thrown out, and her eyes darting forks\r\nof cold lightning.\r\n\r\n"Nay; that I saw not! That, weary weeks of watching and tending have\r\nbrought back to you," I answered--for with such a woman I must be plain!\r\n"Had I seen the smallest sign of decay, I would at once have buried\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Dog of a fool!" she cried, "I was but in a trance--Samoil! what a\r\nfate!--Go and fetch the she-savage from whom you borrowed this hideous\r\ndisguise."\r\n\r\n"I made it for you. It is hideous, but I did my best."\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up to her tall height.\r\n\r\n"How long have I been insensible?" she demanded. "A woman could not have\r\nmade that dress in a day!"\r\n\r\n"Not in twenty days," I rejoined, "hardly in thirty!"\r\n\r\n"Ha! How long do you pretend I have lain unconscious?--Answer me at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell how long you had lain when I found you, but there was\r\nnothing left of you save skin and bone: that is more than three months\r\nago.--Your hair was beautiful, nothing else! I have done for it what I\r\ncould."\r\n\r\n"My poor hair!" she said, and brought a great armful of it round from\r\nbehind her; "--it will be more than a three-months\' care to bring YOU\r\nto life again!--I suppose I must thank you, although I cannot say I am\r\ngrateful!"\r\n\r\n"There is no need, madam: I would have done the same for any woman--yes,\r\nor for any man either!"\r\n\r\n"How is it my hair is not tangled?" she said, fondling it.\r\n\r\n"It always drifted in the current."\r\n\r\n"How?--What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I could not have brought you to life but by bathing you in the hot\r\nriver every morning."\r\n\r\nShe gave a shudder of disgust, and stood for a while with her gaze fixed\r\non the hurrying water. Then she turned to me:\r\n\r\n"We must understand each other!" she said. "--You have done me the two\r\nworst of wrongs--compelled me to live, and put me to shame: neither of\r\nthem can I pardon!"\r\n\r\nShe raised her left hand, and flung it out as if repelling me. Something\r\nice-cold struck me on the forehead. When I came to myself, I was on the\r\nground, wet and shivering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. GONE!--BUT HOW?\r\n\r\nI rose, and looked around me, dazed at heart. For a moment I could not\r\nsee her: she was gone, and loneliness had returned like the cloud after\r\nthe rain! She whom I brought back from the brink of the grave, had fled\r\nfrom me, and left me with desolation! I dared not one moment remain thus\r\nhideously alone. Had I indeed done her a wrong? I must devote my life to\r\nsharing the burden I had compelled her to resume!\r\n\r\nI descried her walking swiftly over the grass, away from the river, took\r\none plunge for a farewell restorative, and set out to follow her. The\r\nlast visit of the white leech, and the blow of the woman, had enfeebled\r\nme, but already my strength was reviving, and I kept her in sight\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\n"Is this, then, the end?" I said as I went, and my heart brooded a\r\nsad song. Her angry, hating eyes haunted me. I could understand her\r\nresentment at my having forced life upon her, but how had I further\r\ninjured her? Why should she loathe me? Could modesty itself be indignant\r\nwith true service? How should the proudest woman, conscious of my every\r\naction, cherish against me the least sense of disgracing wrong? How\r\nreverently had I not touched her! As a father his motherless child, I\r\nhad borne and tended her! Had all my labour, all my despairing hope gone\r\nto redeem only ingratitude? "No," I answered myself; "beauty must have\r\na heart! However profoundly hidden, it must be there! The deeper buried,\r\nthe stronger and truer will it wake at last in its beautiful grave! To\r\nrouse that heart were a better gift to her than the happiest life! It\r\nwould be to give her a nobler, a higher life!"\r\n\r\nShe was ascending a gentle slope before me, walking straight and steady\r\nas one that knew whither, when I became aware that she was increasing\r\nthe distance between us. I summoned my strength, and it came in\r\nfull tide. My veins filled with fresh life! My body seemed to become\r\nethereal, and, following like an easy wind, I rapidly overtook her.\r\n\r\nNot once had she looked behind. Swiftly she moved, like a Greek goddess\r\nto rescue, but without haste. I was within three yards of her, when she\r\nturned sharply, yet with grace unbroken, and stood. Fatigue or heat she\r\nshowed none. Her paleness was not a pallor, but a pure whiteness; her\r\nbreathing was slow and deep. Her eyes seemed to fill the heavens, and\r\ngive light to the world. It was nearly noon, but the sense was upon\r\nme as of a great night in which an invisible dew makes the stars look\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n"Why do you follow me?" she asked, quietly but rather sternly, as if she\r\nhad never before seen me.\r\n\r\n"I have lived so long," I answered, "on the mere hope of your eyes, that\r\nI must want to see them again!"\r\n\r\n"You WILL not be spared!" she said coldly. "I command you to stop where\r\nyou stand."\r\n\r\n"Not until I see you in a place of safety will I leave you," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Then take the consequences," she said, and resumed her swift-gliding\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nBut as she turned she cast on me a glance, and I stood as if run through\r\nwith a spear. Her scorn had failed: she would kill me with her beauty!\r\n\r\nDespair restored my volition; the spell broke; I ran, and overtook her.\r\n\r\n"Have pity upon me!" I cried.\r\n\r\nShe gave no heed. I followed her like a child whose mother pretends to\r\nabandon him. "I will be your slave!" I said, and laid my hand on her\r\narm.\r\n\r\nShe turned as if a serpent had bit her. I cowered before the blaze of\r\nher eyes, but could not avert my own.\r\n\r\n"Pity me," I cried again.\r\n\r\nShe resumed her walking.\r\n\r\nThe whole day I followed her. The sun climbed the sky, seemed to pause\r\non its summit, went down the other side. Not a moment did she pause, not\r\na moment did I cease to follow. She never turned her head, never relaxed\r\nher pace.\r\n\r\nThe sun went below, and the night came up. I kept close to her: if I\r\nlost sight of her for a moment, it would be for ever!\r\n\r\nAll day long we had been walking over thick soft grass: abruptly she\r\nstopped, and threw herself upon it. There was yet light enough to show\r\nthat she was utterly weary. I stood behind her, and gazed down on her\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nDid I love her? I knew she was not good! Did I hate her? I could not\r\nleave her! I knelt beside her.\r\n\r\n"Begone! Do not dare touch me," she cried.\r\n\r\nHer arms lay on the grass by her sides as if paralyzed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they closed about my neck, rigid as those of the\r\ntorture-maiden. She drew down my face to hers, and her lips clung to my\r\ncheek. A sting of pain shot somewhere through me, and pulsed. I could\r\nnot stir a hair\'s breadth. Gradually the pain ceased. A slumberous\r\nweariness, a dreamy pleasure stole over me, and then I knew nothing.\r\n\r\nAll at once I came to myself. The moon was a little way above the\r\nhorizon, but spread no radiance; she was but a bright thing set in\r\nblackness. My cheek smarted; I put my hand to it, and found a wet spot.\r\nMy neck ached: there again was a wet spot! I sighed heavily, and felt\r\nvery tired. I turned my eyes listlessly around me--and saw what had\r\nbecome of the light of the moon: it was gathered about the lady! she\r\nstood in a shimmering nimbus! I rose and staggered toward her.\r\n\r\n"Down!" she cried imperiously, as to a rebellious dog. "Follow me a step\r\nif you dare!"\r\n\r\n"I will!" I murmured, with an agonised effort.\r\n\r\n"Set foot within the gates of my city, and my people will stone you:\r\nthey do not love beggars!"\r\n\r\nI was deaf to her words. Weak as water, and half awake, I did not know\r\nthat I moved, but the distance grew less between us. She took one step\r\nback, raised her left arm, and with the clenched hand seemed to strike\r\nme on the forehead. I received as it were a blow from an iron hammer,\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet, cold and wet, but clear-headed and strong. Had the\r\nblow revived me? it had left neither wound nor pain!--But how came I\r\nwet?--I could not have lain long, for the moon was no higher!\r\n\r\nThe lady stood some yards away, her back toward me. She was doing\r\nsomething, I could not distinguish what. Then by her sudden gleam I knew\r\nshe had thrown off her garments, and stood white in the dazed moon. One\r\nmoment she stood--and fell forward.\r\n\r\nA streak of white shot away in a swift-drawn line. The same instant the\r\nmoon recovered herself, shining out with a full flash, and I saw that\r\nthe streak was a long-bodied thing, rushing in great, low-curved bounds\r\nover the grass. Dark spots seemed to run like a stream adown its back,\r\nas if it had been fleeting along under the edge of a wood, and catching\r\nthe shadows of the leaves.\r\n\r\n"God of mercy!" I cried, "is the terrible creature speeding to the\r\nnight-infolded city?" and I seemed to hear from afar the sudden burst\r\nand spread of outcrying terror, as the pale savage bounded from house to\r\nhouse, rending and slaying.\r\n\r\nWhile I gazed after it fear-stricken, past me from behind, like a swift,\r\nall but noiseless arrow, shot a second large creature, pure white. Its\r\npath was straight for the spot where the lady had fallen, and, as I\r\nthought, lay. My tongue clave to the roof of my mouth. I sprang forward\r\npursuing the beast. But in a moment the spot I made for was far behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"It was well," I thought, "that I could not cry out: if she had risen,\r\nthe monster would have been upon her!"\r\n\r\nBut when I reached the place, no lady was there; only the garments she\r\nhad dropped lay dusk in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nI stood staring after the second beast. It tore over the ground with yet\r\ngreater swiftness than the former--in long, level, skimming leaps, the\r\nvery embodiment of wasteless speed. It followed the line the other had\r\ntaken, and I watched it grow smaller and smaller, until it disappeared\r\nin the uncertain distance.\r\n\r\nBut where was the lady? Had the first beast surprised her, creeping upon\r\nher noiselessly? I had heard no shriek! and there had not been time to\r\ndevour her! Could it have caught her up as it ran, and borne her away to\r\nits den? So laden it could not have run so fast! and I should have seen\r\nthat it carried something!\r\n\r\nHorrible doubts began to wake in me. After a thorough but fruitless\r\nsearch, I set out in the track of the two animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE FUGITIVE MOTHER\r\n\r\nAs I hastened along, a cloud came over the moon, and from the gray dark\r\nsuddenly emerged a white figure, clasping a child to her bosom, and\r\nstooping as she ran. She was on a line parallel with my own, but did not\r\nperceive me as she hurried along, terror and anxiety in every movement\r\nof her driven speed.\r\n\r\n"She is chased!" I said to myself. "Some prowler of this terrible night\r\nis after her!"\r\n\r\nTo follow would have added to her fright: I stepped into her track to\r\nstop her pursuer.\r\n\r\nAs I stood for a moment looking after her through the dusk, behind me\r\ncame a swift, soft-footed rush, and ere I could turn, something sprang\r\nover my head, struck me sharply on the forehead, and knocked me down.\r\nI was up in an instant, but all I saw of my assailant was a vanishing\r\nwhiteness. I ran after the beast, with the blood trickling from my\r\nforehead; but had run only a few steps, when a shriek of despair tore\r\nthe quivering night. I ran the faster, though I could not but fear it\r\nmust already be too late.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two I spied a low white shape approaching me through the\r\nvapour-dusted moonlight. It must be another beast, I thought at first,\r\nfor it came slowly, almost crawling, with strange, floundering leaps,\r\nas of a creature in agony! I drew aside from its path, and waited. As it\r\nneared me, I saw it was going on three legs, carrying its left fore-paw\r\nhigh from the ground. It had many dark, oval spots on a shining white\r\nskin, and was attended by a low rushing sound, as of water falling upon\r\ngrass. As it went by me, I saw something streaming from the lifted paw.\r\n\r\n"It is blood!" I said to myself, "some readier champion than I has\r\nwounded the beast!" But, strange to tell, such a pity seized me at sight\r\nof the suffering creature, that, though an axe had been in my hand I\r\ncould not have struck at it. In a broken succession of hobbling leaps\r\nit went out of sight, its blood, as it seemed, still issuing in a small\r\ntorrent, which kept flowing back softly through the grass beside me. "If\r\nit go on bleeding like that," I thought, "it will soon be hurtless!"\r\n\r\nI went on, for I might yet be useful to the woman, and hoped also to see\r\nher deliverer.\r\n\r\nI descried her a little way off, seated on the grass, with her child in\r\nher lap.\r\n\r\n"Can I do anything for you?" I asked.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice she started violently, and would have risen. I\r\nthrew myself on the ground.\r\n\r\n"You need not be frightened," I said. "I was following the beast when\r\nhappily you found a nearer protector! It passed me now with its foot\r\nbleeding so much that by this time it must be all but dead!"\r\n\r\n"There is little hope of that!" she answered, trembling. "Do you not\r\nknow whose beast she is?"\r\n\r\nNow I had certain strange suspicions, but I answered that I knew nothing\r\nof the brute, and asked what had become of her champion.\r\n\r\n"What champion?" she rejoined. "I have seen no one."\r\n\r\n"Then how came the monster to grief?"\r\n\r\n"I pounded her foot with a stone--as hard as I could strike. Did you not\r\nhear her cry?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you are a brave woman!" I answered. "I thought it was you gave\r\nthe cry!"\r\n\r\n"It was the leopardess."\r\n\r\n"I never heard such a sound from the throat of an animal! it was like\r\nthe scream of a woman in torture!"\r\n\r\n"My voice was gone; I could not have shrieked to save my baby! When I\r\nsaw the horrid mouth at my darling\'s little white neck, I caught up a\r\nstone and mashed her lame foot."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about the creature," I said; "I am a stranger in these parts."\r\n\r\n"You will soon know about her if you are going to Bulika!" she answered.\r\n"Now, I must never go back there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am going to Bulika," I said, "--to see the princess."\r\n\r\n"Have a care; you had better not go!--But perhaps you are--! The\r\nprincess is a very good, kind woman!"\r\n\r\nI heard a little movement. Clouds had by this time gathered so thick\r\nover the moon that I could scarcely see my companion: I feared she was\r\nrising to run from me.\r\n\r\n"You are in no danger of any sort from me," I said. "What oath would you\r\nlike me to take?"\r\n\r\n"I know by your speech that you are not of the people of Bulika," she\r\nreplied; "I will trust you!--I am not of them, either, else I should not\r\nbe able: they never trust any one--If only I could see you! But I like\r\nyour voice!--There, my darling is asleep! The foul beast has not hurt\r\nher!--Yes: it was my baby she was after!" she went on, caressing the\r\nchild. "And then she would have torn her mother to pieces for carrying\r\nher off!--Some say the princess has two white leopardesses," she\r\ncontinued: "I know only one--with spots. Everybody knows HER! If the\r\nprincess hear of a baby, she sends her immediately to suck its blood,\r\nand then it either dies or grows up an idiot. I would have gone away\r\nwith my baby, but the princess was from home, and I thought I might wait\r\nuntil I was a little stronger. But she must have taken the beast with\r\nher, and been on her way home when I left, and come across my track. I\r\nheard the SNIFF-SNUFF of the leopardess behind me, and ran;--oh, how I\r\nran!--But my darling will not die! There is no mark on her!"\r\n\r\n"Where are you taking her?"\r\n\r\n"Where no one ever tells!"\r\n\r\n"Why is the princess so cruel?"\r\n\r\n"There is an old prophecy that a child will be the death of her. That is\r\nwhy she will listen to no offer of marriage, they say."\r\n\r\n"But what will become of her country if she kill all the babies?"\r\n\r\n"She does not care about her country. She sends witches around to teach\r\nthe women spells that keep babies away, and give them horrible things\r\nto eat. Some say she is in league with the Shadows to put an end to the\r\nrace. At night we hear the questing beast, and lie awake and shiver. She\r\ncan tell at once the house where a baby is coming, and lies down at the\r\ndoor, watching to get in. There are words that have power to shoo her\r\naway, only they do not always work--But here I sit talking, and the\r\nbeast may by this time have got home, and her mistress be sending the\r\nother after us!"\r\n\r\nAs thus she ended, she rose in haste.\r\n\r\n"I do not think she will ever get home.--Let me carry the baby for you!"\r\nI said, as I rose also.\r\n\r\nShe returned me no answer, and when I would have taken it, only clasped\r\nit the closer.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think," I said, walking by her side, "how the brute could be\r\nbleeding so much!"\r\n\r\n"Take my advice, and don\'t go near the palace," she answered. "There are\r\nsounds in it at night as if the dead were trying to shriek, but could\r\nnot open their mouths!"\r\n\r\nShe bade me an abrupt farewell. Plainly she did not want more of my\r\ncompany; so I stood still, and heard her footsteps die away on the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. BULIKA\r\n\r\nI had lost all notion of my position, and was walking about in pure,\r\nhelpless impatience, when suddenly I found myself in the path of the\r\nleopardess, wading in the blood from her paw. It ran against my ankles\r\nwith the force of a small brook, and I got out of it the more quickly\r\nbecause of an unshaped suspicion in my mind as to whose blood it might\r\nbe. But I kept close to the sound of it, walking up the side of the\r\nstream, for it would guide me in the direction of Bulika.\r\n\r\nI soon began to reflect, however, that no leopardess, no elephant, no\r\nhugest animal that in our world preceded man, could keep such a torrent\r\nflowing, except every artery in its body were open, and its huge system\r\nwent on filling its vessels from fields and lakes and forests as fast as\r\nthey emptied themselves: it could not be blood! I dipped a finger in it,\r\nand at once satisfied myself that it was not. In truth, however it might\r\nhave come there, it was a softly murmuring rivulet of water that ran,\r\nwithout channel, over the grass! But sweet as was its song, I dared not\r\ndrink of it; I kept walking on, hoping after the light, and listening to\r\nthe familiar sound so long unheard--for that of the hot stream was very\r\ndifferent. The mere wetting of my feet in it, however, had so refreshed\r\nme, that I went on without fatigue till the darkness began to grow\r\nthinner, and I knew the sun was drawing nigh. A few minutes more, and\r\nI could discern, against the pale aurora, the wall-towers of a\r\ncity--seemingly old as time itself. Then I looked down to get a sight of\r\nthe brook.\r\n\r\nIt was gone. I had indeed for a long time noted its sound growing\r\nfainter, but at last had ceased to attend to it. I looked back: the\r\ngrass in its course lay bent as it had flowed, and here and there\r\nglimmered a small pool. Toward the city, there was no trace of it. Near\r\nwhere I stood, the flow of its fountain must at least have paused!\r\n\r\nAround the city were gardens, growing many sorts of vegetables, hardly\r\none of which I recognised. I saw no water, no flowers, no sign of\r\nanimals. The gardens came very near the walls, but were separated from\r\nthem by huge heaps of gravel and refuse thrown from the battlements.\r\n\r\nI went up to the nearest gate, and found it but half-closed, nowise\r\nsecured, and without guard or sentinel. To judge by its hinges, it could\r\nnot be farther opened or shut closer. Passing through, I looked down\r\na long ancient street. It was utterly silent, and with scarce an\r\nindication in it of life present. Had I come upon a dead city? I turned\r\nand went out again, toiled a long way over the dust-heaps, and crossed\r\nseveral roads, each leading up to a gate: I would not re-enter until\r\nsome of the inhabitants should be stirring.\r\n\r\nWhat was I there for? what did I expect or hope to find? what did I mean\r\nto do?\r\n\r\nI must see, if but once more, the woman I had brought to life! I did\r\nnot desire her society: she had waked in me frightful suspicions; and\r\nfriendship, not to say love, was wildly impossible between us! But her\r\npresence had had a strange influence upon me, and in her presence I\r\nmust resist, and at the same time analyse that influence! The seemingly\r\ninscrutable in her I would fain penetrate: to understand something of\r\nher mode of being would be to look into marvels such as imagination\r\ncould never have suggested! In this I was too daring: a man must not,\r\nfor knowledge, of his own will encounter temptation! On the other hand,\r\nI had reinstated an evil force about to perish, and was, to the extent\r\nof my opposing faculty, accountable for what mischief might ensue! I had\r\nlearned that she was the enemy of children: the Little Ones might be in\r\nher danger! It was in the hope of finding out something of their history\r\nthat I had left them; on that I had received a little light: I must have\r\nmore; I must learn how to protect them!\r\n\r\nHearing at length a little stir in the place, I walked through the\r\nnext gate, and thence along a narrow street of tall houses to a little\r\nsquare, where I sat down on the base of a pillar with a hideous bat-like\r\ncreature atop. Ere long, several of the inhabitants came sauntering\r\npast. I spoke to one: he gave me a rude stare and ruder word, and went\r\non.\r\n\r\nI got up and went through one narrow street after another, gradually\r\nfilling with idlers, and was not surprised to see no children. By\r\nand by, near one of the gates, I encountered a group of young men who\r\nreminded me not a little of the bad giants. They came about me staring,\r\nand presently began to push and hustle me, then to throw things at me.\r\nI bore it as well as I could, wishing not to provoke enmity where\r\nwanted to remain for a while. Oftener than once or twice I appealed to\r\npassers-by whom I fancied more benevolent-looking, but none would halt\r\na moment to listen to me. I looked poor, and that was enough: to the\r\ncitizens of Bulika, as to house-dogs, poverty was an offence! Deformity\r\nand sickness were taxed; and no legislation of their princess was more\r\nheartily approved of than what tended to make poverty subserve wealth.\r\n\r\nI took to my heels at last, and no one followed me beyond the gate. A\r\nlumbering fellow, however, who sat by it eating a hunch of bread, picked\r\nup a stone to throw after me, and happily, in his stupid eagerness,\r\nthrew, not the stone but the bread. I took it, and he did not dare\r\nfollow to reclaim it: beyond the walls they were cowards every one. I\r\nwent off a few hundred yards, threw myself down, ate the bread, fell\r\nasleep, and slept soundly in the grass, where the hot sunlight renewed\r\nmy strength.\r\n\r\nIt was night when I woke. The moon looked down on me in friendly\r\nfashion, seeming to claim with me old acquaintance. She was very bright,\r\nand the same moon, I thought, that saw me through the terrors of my\r\nfirst night in that strange world. A cold wind blew from the gate,\r\nbringing with it an evil odour; but it did not chill me, for the sun had\r\nplenished me with warmth. I crept again into the city. There I found the\r\nfew that were still in the open air crouched in corners to escape the\r\nshivering blast.\r\n\r\nI was walking slowly through the long narrow street, when, just before\r\nme, a huge white thing bounded across it, with a single flash in the\r\nmoonlight, and disappeared. I turned down the next opening, eager to get\r\nsight of it again.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow lane, almost too narrow to pass through, but it led\r\nme into a wider street. The moment I entered the latter, I saw on\r\nthe opposite side, in the shadow, the creature I had followed, itself\r\nfollowing like a dog what I took for a man. Over his shoulder, every\r\nother moment, he glanced at the animal behind him, but neither spoke to\r\nit, nor attempted to drive it away. At a place where he had to cross a\r\npatch of moonlight, I saw that he cast no shadow, and was himself but\r\na flat superficial shadow, of two dimensions. He was, nevertheless, an\r\nopaque shadow, for he not merely darkened any object on the other\r\nside of him, but rendered it, in fact, invisible. In the shadow he was\r\nblacker than the shadow; in the moonlight he looked like one who had\r\ndrawn his shadow up about him, for not a suspicion of it moved beside\r\nor under him; while the gleaming animal, which followed so close at his\r\nheels as to seem the white shadow of his blackness, and which I now saw\r\nto be a leopardess, drew her own gliding shadow black over the ground by\r\nher side. When they passed together from the shadow into the moonlight,\r\nthe Shadow deepened in blackness, the animal flashed into radiance. I\r\nwas at the moment walking abreast of them on the opposite side, my bare\r\nfeet sounding on the flat stones: the leopardess never turned head\r\nor twitched ear; the shadow seemed once to look at me, for I lost his\r\nprofile, and saw for a second only a sharp upright line. That instant\r\nthe wind found me and blew through me: I shuddered from head to foot,\r\nand my heart went from wall to wall of my bosom, like a pebble in a\r\nchild\'s rattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. A WOMAN OF BULIKA\r\n\r\nI turned aside into an alley, and sought shelter in a small archway. In\r\nthe mouth of it I stopped, and looked out at the moonlight which filled\r\nthe alley. The same instant a woman came gliding in after me, turned,\r\ntrembling, and looked out also. A few seconds passed; then a huge\r\nleopard, its white skin dappled with many blots, darted across the\r\narchway. The woman pressed close to me, and my heart filled with pity. I\r\nput my arm round her.\r\n\r\n"If the brute come here, I will lay hold of it," I said, "and you must\r\nrun."\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen it before?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Several times," she answered, still trembling. "She is a pet of the\r\nprincess\'s. You are a stranger, or you would know her!"\r\n\r\n"I am a stranger," I answered. "But is she, then, allowed to run loose?"\r\n\r\n"She is kept in a cage, her mouth muzzled, and her feet in gloves of\r\ncrocodile leather. Chained she is too; but she gets out often, and sucks\r\nthe blood of any child she can lay hold of. Happily there are not many\r\nmothers in Bulika!"\r\n\r\nHere she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"I wish I were at home!" she sobbed. "The princess returned only last\r\nnight, and there is the leopardess out already! How am I to get into the\r\nhouse? It is me she is after, I know! She will be lying at my own door,\r\nwatching for me!--But I am a fool to talk to a stranger!"\r\n\r\n"All strangers are not bad!" I said. "The beast shall not touch you till\r\nshe has done with me, and by that time you will be in. You are happy to\r\nhave a house to go to! What a terrible wind it is!"\r\n\r\n"Take me home safe, and I will give you shelter from it," she rejoined.\r\n"But we must wait a little!"\r\n\r\nI asked her many questions. She told me the people never did anything\r\nexcept dig for precious stones in their cellars. They were rich, and had\r\neverything made for them in other towns.\r\n\r\n"Why?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Because it is a disgrace to work," she answered. "Everybody in Bulika\r\nknows that!"\r\n\r\nI asked how they were rich if none of them earned money. She replied\r\nthat their ancestors had saved for them, and they never spent. When they\r\nwanted money they sold a few of their gems.\r\n\r\n"But there must be some poor!" I said.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there must be, but we never think of such people. When one\r\ngoes poor, we forget him. That is how we keep rich. We mean to be rich\r\nalways."\r\n\r\n"But when you have dug up all your precious stones and sold them, you\r\nwill have to spend your money, and one day you will have none left!"\r\n\r\n"We have so many, and there are so many still in the ground, that that\r\nday will never come," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Suppose a strange people were to fall upon you, and take everything you\r\nhave!"\r\n\r\n"No strange people will dare; they are all horribly afraid of our\r\nprincess. She it is who keeps us safe and free and rich!"\r\n\r\nEvery now and then as she spoke, she would stop and look behind her.\r\n\r\nI asked why her people had such a hatred of strangers. She answered that\r\nthe presence of a stranger defiled the city.\r\n\r\n"How is that?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Because we are more ancient and noble than any other\r\nnation.--Therefore," she added, "we always turn strangers out before\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"How, then, can you take me into your house?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I will make an exception of you," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Is there no place in the city for the taking in of strangers?"\r\n\r\n"Such a place would be pulled down, and its owner burned. How is purity\r\nto be preserved except by keeping low people at a proper distance?\r\nDignity is such a delicate thing!"\r\n\r\nShe told me that their princess had reigned for thousands of years; that\r\nshe had power over the air and the water as well as the earth--and, she\r\nbelieved, over the fire too; that she could do what she pleased, and was\r\nanswerable to nobody.\r\n\r\nWhen at length she was willing to risk the attempt, we took our way\r\nthrough lanes and narrow passages, and reached her door without having\r\nmet a single live creature. It was in a wider street, between two\r\ntall houses, at the top of a narrow, steep stair, up which she climbed\r\nslowly, and I followed. Ere we reached the top, however, she seemed to\r\ntake fright, and darted up the rest of the steps: I arrived just in time\r\nto have the door closed in my face, and stood confounded on the landing,\r\nwhere was about length enough, between the opposite doors of the two\r\nhouses, for a man to lie down.\r\n\r\nWeary, and not scrupling to defile Bulika with my presence, I took\r\nadvantage of the shelter, poor as it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE WHITE LEOPARDESS\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stair lay the moonlit street, and I could hear the\r\nunwholesome, inhospitable wind blowing about below. But not a breath of\r\nit entered my retreat, and I was composing myself to rest, when suddenly\r\nmy eyes opened, and there was the head of the shining creature I had\r\nseen following the Shadow, just rising above the uppermost step! The\r\nmoment she caught sight of my eyes, she stopped and began to retire,\r\ntail foremost. I sprang up; whereupon, having no room to turn, she threw\r\nherself backward, head over tail, scrambled to her feet, and in a moment\r\nwas down the stair and gone. I followed her to the bottom, and looked\r\nall up and down the street. Not seeing her, I went back to my hard\r\ncouch.\r\n\r\nThere were, then, two evil creatures prowling about the city, one with,\r\nand one without spots! I was not inclined to risk much for man or woman\r\nin Bulika, but the life of a child might well be worth such a poor\r\none as mine, and I resolved to keep watch at that door the rest of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nPresently I heard the latch move, slow, slow: I looked up, and seeing\r\nthe door half-open, rose and slid softly in. Behind it stood, not the\r\nwoman I had befriended, but the muffled woman of the desert. Without a\r\nword she led me a few steps to an empty stone-paved chamber, and pointed\r\nto a rug on the floor. I wrapped myself in it, and once more lay down.\r\nShe shut the door of the room, and I heard the outer door open and close\r\nagain. There was no light save what came from the moonlit air.\r\n\r\nAs I lay sleepless, I began to hear a stifled moaning. It went on for\r\na good while, and then came the cry of a child, followed by a terrible\r\nshriek. I sprang up and darted into the passage: from another door in it\r\ncame the white leopardess with a new-born baby in her mouth, carrying\r\nit like a cub of her own. I threw myself upon her, and compelled her to\r\ndrop the infant, which fell on the stone slabs with a piteous wail.\r\n\r\nAt the cry appeared the muffled woman. She stepped over us, the beast\r\nand myself, where we lay struggling in the narrow passage, took up the\r\nchild, and carried it away. Returning, she lifted me off the animal,\r\nopened the door, and pushed me gently out. At my heels followed the\r\nleopardess.\r\n\r\n"She too has failed me!" thought I; "--given me up to the beast to be\r\nsettled with at her leisure! But we shall have a tussle for it!"\r\n\r\nI ran down the stair, fearing she would spring on my back, but she\r\nfollowed me quietly. At the foot I turned to lay hold of her, but\r\nshe sprang over my head; and when again I turned to face her, she was\r\ncrouching at my feet! I stooped and stroked her lovely white skin;\r\nshe responded by licking my bare feet with her hard dry tongue. Then I\r\npatted and fondled her, a well of tenderness overflowing in my heart:\r\nshe might be treacherous too, but if I turned from every show of love\r\nlest it should be feigned, how was I ever to find the real love which\r\nmust be somewhere in every world?\r\n\r\nI stood up; she rose, and stood beside me.\r\n\r\nA bulky object fell with a heavy squelch in the middle of the street, a\r\nfew yards from us. I ran to it, and found a pulpy mass, with just form\r\nenough left to show it the body of a woman. It must have been thrown\r\nfrom some neighbouring window! I looked around me: the Shadow was\r\nwalking along the other side of the way, with the white leopardess again\r\nat his heel!\r\n\r\nI followed and gained upon them, urging in my heart for the leopardess\r\nthat probably she was not a free agent. When I got near them, however,\r\nshe turned and flew at me with such a hideous snarl, that instinctively\r\nI drew back: instantly she resumed her place behind the Shadow. Again\r\nI drew near; again she flew at me, her eyes flaming like live emeralds.\r\nOnce more I made the experiment: she snapped at me like a dog, and\r\nbit me. My heart gave way, and I uttered a cry; whereupon the creature\r\nlooked round with a glance that plainly meant--"Why WOULD you make me do\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nI turned away angry with myself: I had been losing my time ever since\r\nI entered the place! night as it was I would go straight to the palace!\r\nFrom the square I had seen it--high above the heart of the city,\r\ncompassed with many defences, more a fortress than a palace!\r\n\r\nBut I found its fortifications, like those of the city, much neglected,\r\nand partly ruinous. For centuries, clearly, they had been of no account!\r\nIt had great and strong gates, with something like a drawbridge to them\r\nover a rocky chasm; but they stood open, and it was hard to believe that\r\nwater had ever occupied the hollow before them. All was so still that\r\nsleep seemed to interpenetrate the structure, causing the very moonlight\r\nto look discordantly awake. I must either enter like a thief, or break a\r\nsilence that rendered frightful the mere thought of a sound!\r\n\r\nLike an outcast dog I was walking about the walls, when I came to a\r\nlittle recess with a stone bench: I took refuge in it from the wind, lay\r\ndown, and in spite of the cold fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nI was wakened by something leaping upon me, and licking my face with\r\nthe rough tongue of a feline animal. "It is the white leopardess!" I\r\nthought. "She is come to suck my blood!--and why should she not have\r\nit?--it would cost me more to defend than to yield it!" So I lay still,\r\nexpecting a shoot of pain. But the pang did not arrive; a pleasant\r\nwarmth instead began to diffuse itself through me. Stretched at my back,\r\nshe lay as close to me as she could lie, the heat of her body slowly\r\npenetrating mine, and her breath, which had nothing of the wild beast in\r\nit, swathing my head and face in a genial atmosphere. A full conviction\r\nthat her intention toward me was good, gained possession of me. I\r\nturned like a sleepy boy, threw my arm over her, and sank into profound\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to come to myself, I fancied I lay warm and soft in my own\r\nbed. "Is it possible I am at home?" I thought. The well-known scents of\r\nthe garden seemed to come crowding in. I rubbed my eyes, and looked out:\r\nI lay on a bare stone, in the heart of a hateful city!\r\n\r\nI sprang from the bench. Had I indeed had a leopardess for my bedfellow,\r\nor had I but dreamed it? She had but just left me, for the warmth of her\r\nbody was with me yet!\r\n\r\nI left the recess with a new hope, as strong as it was shapeless. One\r\nthing only was clear to me: I must find the princess! Surely I had some\r\npower with her, if not over her! Had I not saved her life, and had she\r\nnot prolonged it at the expense of my vitality? The reflection gave me\r\ncourage to encounter her, be she what she might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. THE PRINCESS\r\n\r\nMaking a circuit of the castle, I came again to the open gates, crossed\r\nthe ravine-like moat, and found myself in a paved court, planted at\r\nregular intervals with towering trees like poplars. In the centre was\r\none taller than the rest, whose branches, near the top, spread a little\r\nand gave it some resemblance to a palm. Between their great stems I\r\ngot glimpses of the palace, which was of a style strange to me, but\r\nsuggested Indian origin. It was long and low, with lofty towers at the\r\ncorners, and one huge dome in the middle, rising from the roof to half\r\nthe height of the towers. The main entrance was in the centre of the\r\nfront--a low arch that seemed half an ellipse. No one was visible, the\r\ndoors stood wide open, and I went unchallenged into a large hall, in\r\nthe form of a longish ellipse. Toward one side stood a cage, in which\r\ncouched, its head on its paws, a huge leopardess, chained by a steel\r\ncollar, with its mouth muzzled and its paws muffled. It was white\r\nwith dark oval spots, and lay staring out of wide-open eyes, with\r\ncanoe-shaped pupils, and great green irids. It appeared to watch me, but\r\nnot an eyeball, not a foot, not a whisker moved, and its tail stretched\r\nout behind it rigid as an iron bar. I could not tell whether it was a\r\nlive thing or not.\r\n\r\nFrom this vestibule two low passages led; I took one of them, and\r\nfound it branch into many, all narrow and irregular. At a spot where was\r\nscarce room for two to pass, a page ran against me. He started back in\r\nterror, but having scanned me, gathered impudence, puffed himself out,\r\nand asked my business.\r\n\r\n"To see the princess," I answered.\r\n\r\n"A likely thing!" he returned. "I have not seen her highness this\r\nmorning myself!"\r\n\r\nI caught him by the back of the neck, shook him, and said, "Take me to\r\nher at once, or I will drag you with me till I find her. She shall know\r\nhow her servants receive her visitors."\r\n\r\nHe gave a look at me, and began to pull like a blind man\'s dog, leading\r\nme thus to a large kitchen, where were many servants, feebly busy, and\r\nhardly awake. I expected them to fall upon me and drive me out, but they\r\nstared instead, with wide eyes--not at me, but at something behind me,\r\nand grew more ghastly as they stared. I turned my head, and saw the\r\nwhite leopardess, regarding them in a way that might have feared stouter\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, one of them, seeing, I suppose, that attack was not\r\nimminent, began to recover himself; I turned to him, and let the boy go.\r\n\r\n"Take me to the princess," I said.\r\n\r\n"She has not yet left her room, your lordship," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Let her know that I am here, waiting audience of her."\r\n\r\n"Will your lordship please to give me your name?"\r\n\r\n"Tell her that one who knows the white leech desires to see her."\r\n\r\n"She will kill me if I take such a message: I must not. I dare not."\r\n\r\n"You refuse?"\r\n\r\nHe cast a glance at my attendant, and went.\r\n\r\nThe others continued staring--too much afraid of her to take their eyes\r\noff her. I turned to the graceful creature, where she stood, her muzzle\r\ndropped to my heel, white as milk, a warm splendour in the gloomy place,\r\nand stooped and patted her. She looked up at me; the mere movement of\r\nher head was enough to scatter them in all directions. She rose on her\r\nhind legs, and put her paws on my shoulders; I threw my arms round her.\r\nShe pricked her ears, broke from me, and was out of sight in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe man I had sent to the princess entered.\r\n\r\n"Please to come this way, my lord," he said.\r\n\r\nMy heart gave a throb, as if bracing itself to the encounter. I followed\r\nhim through many passages, and was at last shown into a room so large\r\nand so dark that its walls were invisible. A single spot on the floor\r\nreflected a little light, but around that spot all was black. I looked\r\nup, and saw at a great height an oval aperture in the roof, on the\r\nperiphery of which appeared the joints between blocks of black marble.\r\nThe light on the floor showed close fitting slabs of the same material.\r\nI found afterward that the elliptical wall as well was of black marble,\r\nabsorbing the little light that reached it. The roof was the long half\r\nof an ellipsoid, and the opening in it was over one of the foci of the\r\nellipse of the floor. I fancied I caught sight of reddish lines, but\r\nwhen I would have examined them, they were gone.\r\n\r\nAll at once, a radiant form stood in the centre of the darkness,\r\nflashing a splendour on every side. Over a robe of soft white, her hair\r\nstreamed in a cataract, black as the marble on which it fell. Her\r\neyes were a luminous blackness; her arms and feet like warm ivory. She\r\ngreeted me with the innocent smile of a girl--and in face, figure, and\r\nmotion seemed but now to have stepped over the threshold of womanhood.\r\n"Alas," thought I, "ill did I reckon my danger! Can this be the woman I\r\nrescued--she who struck me, scorned me, left me?" I stood gazing at her\r\nout of the darkness; she stood gazing into it, as if searching for me.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared. "She will not acknowledge me!" I thought. But the next\r\ninstant her eyes flashed out of the dark straight into mine. She had\r\ndescried me and come to me!\r\n\r\n"You have found me at last!" she said, laying her hand on my shoulder.\r\n"I knew you would!"\r\n\r\nMy frame quivered with conflicting consciousnesses, to analyse which\r\nI had no power. I was simultaneously attracted and repelled: each\r\nsensation seemed either.\r\n\r\n"You shiver!" she said. "This place is cold for you! Come."\r\n\r\nI stood silent: she had struck me dumb with beauty; she held me dumb\r\nwith sweetness.\r\n\r\nTaking me by the hand, she drew me to the spot of light, and again\r\nflashed upon me. An instant she stood there.\r\n\r\n"You have grown brown since last I saw you," she said.\r\n\r\n"This is almost the first roof I have been under since you left me," I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"Whose was the other?" she rejoined.\r\n\r\n"I do not know the woman\'s name."\r\n\r\n"I would gladly learn it! The instinct of hospitality is not strong\r\nin my people!" She took me again by the hand, and led me through the\r\ndarkness many steps to a curtain of black. Beyond it was a white stair,\r\nup which she conducted me to a beautiful chamber.\r\n\r\n"How you must miss the hot flowing river!" she said. "But there is a\r\nbath in the corner with no white leeches in it! At the foot of your\r\ncouch you will find a garment. When you come down, I shall be in the\r\nroom to your left at the foot of the stair."\r\n\r\nI stood as she left me, accusing my presumption: how was I to treat\r\nthis lovely woman as a thing of evil, who behaved to me like a\r\nsister?--Whence the marvellous change in her? She left me with a blow;\r\nshe received me almost with an embrace! She had reviled me; she said\r\nshe knew I would follow and find her! Did she know my doubts concerning\r\nher--how much I should want explained? COULD she explain all? Could I\r\nbelieve her if she did? As to her hospitality, I had surely earned\r\nand might accept that--at least until I came to a definite judgment\r\nconcerning her!\r\n\r\nCould such beauty as I saw, and such wickedness as I suspected, exist\r\nin the same person? If they could, HOW was it possible? Unable to answer\r\nthe former question, I must let the latter wait!\r\n\r\nClear as crystal, the water in the great white bath sent a sparkling\r\nflash from the corner where it lay sunk in the marble floor, and seemed\r\nto invite me to its embrace. Except the hot stream, two draughts in the\r\ncottage of the veiled woman, and the pools in the track of the wounded\r\nleopardess, I had not seen water since leaving home: it looked a thing\r\ncelestial. I plunged in.\r\n\r\nImmediately my brain was filled with an odour strange and delicate,\r\nwhich yet I did not altogether like. It made me doubt the princess\r\nafresh: had she medicated it? had she enchanted it? was she in any way\r\nworking on me unlawfully? And how was there water in the palace, and not\r\na drop in the city? I remembered the crushed paw of the leopardess, and\r\nsprang from the bath.\r\n\r\nWhat had I been bathing in? Again I saw the fleeing mother, again I\r\nheard the howl, again I saw the limping beast. But what matter whence it\r\nflowed? was not the water sweet? Was it not very water the pitcher-plant\r\nsecreted from its heart, and stored for the weary traveller? Water came\r\nfrom heaven: what mattered the well where it gathered, or the spring\r\nwhence it burst? But I did not re-enter the bath.\r\n\r\nI put on the robe of white wool, embroidered on the neck and hem, that\r\nlay ready for me, and went down the stair to the room whither my hostess\r\nhad directed me. It was round, all of alabaster, and without a single\r\nwindow: the light came through everywhere, a soft, pearly shimmer rather\r\nthan shine. Vague shadowy forms went flitting about over the walls and\r\nlow dome, like loose rain-clouds over a grey-blue sky.\r\n\r\nThe princess stood waiting me, in a robe embroidered with argentine\r\nrings and discs, rectangles and lozenges, close together--a silver\r\nmail. It fell unbroken from her neck and hid her feet, but its long open\r\nsleeves left her arms bare.\r\n\r\nIn the room was a table of ivory, bearing cakes and fruit, an ivory jug\r\nof milk, a crystal jug of wine of a pale rose-colour, and a white loaf.\r\n\r\n"Here we do not kill to eat," she said; "but I think you will like what\r\nI can give you."\r\n\r\nI told her I could desire nothing better than what I saw. She seated\r\nherself on a couch by the table, and made me a sign to sit by her.\r\n\r\nShe poured me out a bowlful of milk, and, handing me the loaf, begged\r\nme to break from it such a piece as I liked. Then she filled from the\r\nwine-jug two silver goblets of grotesquely graceful workmanship.\r\n\r\n"You have never drunk wine like this!" she said.\r\n\r\nI drank, and wondered: every flower of Hybla and Hymettus must have sent\r\nits ghost to swell the soul of that wine!\r\n\r\n"And now that you will be able to listen," she went on, "I must do what\r\nI can to make myself intelligible to you. Our natures, however, are so\r\ndifferent, that this may not be easy. Men and women live but to die; we,\r\nthat is such as I--we are but a few--live to live on. Old age is to you\r\na horror; to me it is a dear desire: the older we grow, the nearer we\r\nare to our perfection. Your perfection is a poor thing, comes soon, and\r\nlasts but a little while; ours is a ceaseless ripening. I am not yet\r\nripe, and have lived thousands of your years--how many, I never cared to\r\nnote. The everlasting will not be measured.\r\n\r\n"Many lovers have sought me; I have loved none of them: they sought but\r\nto enslave me; they sought me but as the men of my city seek gems of\r\nprice.--When you found me, I found a man! I put you to the test; you\r\nstood it; your love was genuine!--It was, however, far from ideal--far\r\nfrom such love as I would have. You loved me truly, but not with true\r\nlove. Pity has, but is not love. What woman of any world would return\r\nlove for pity? Such love as yours was then, is hateful to me. I knew\r\nthat, if you saw me as I am, you would love me--like the rest of\r\nthem--to have and to hold: I would none of that either! I would be\r\notherwise loved! I would have a love that outlived hopelessness,\r\noutmeasured indifference, hate, scorn! Therefore did I put on cruelty,\r\ndespite, ingratitude. When I left you, I had shown myself such as you\r\ncould at least no longer follow from pity: I was no longer in need\r\nof you! But you must satisfy my desire or set me free--prove yourself\r\npriceless or worthless! To satisfy the hunger of my love, you must\r\nfollow me, looking for nothing, not gratitude, not even pity in\r\nreturn!--follow and find me, and be content with merest presence, with\r\nscantest forbearance!--I, not you, have failed; I yield the contest."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me tenderly, and hid her face in her hands. But I had\r\ncaught a flash and a sparkle behind the tenderness, and did not believe\r\nher. She laid herself out to secure and enslave me; she only fascinated\r\nme!\r\n\r\n"Beautiful princess," I said, "let me understand how you came to be\r\nfound in such evil plight."\r\n\r\n"There are things I cannot explain," she replied, "until you have become\r\ncapable of understanding them--which can only be when love is grown\r\nperfect. There are many things so hidden from you that you cannot even\r\nwish to know them; but any question you can put, I can in some measure\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"I had set out to visit a part of my dominions occupied by a savage\r\ndwarf-people, strong and fierce, enemies to law and order, opposed to\r\nevery kind of progress--an evil race. I went alone, fearing nothing,\r\nunaware of the least necessity for precaution. I did not know that upon\r\nthe hot stream beside which you found me, a certain woman, by no means\r\nso powerful as myself, not being immortal, had cast what you call a\r\nspell--which is merely the setting in motion of a force as natural as\r\nany other, but operating primarily in a region beyond the ken of the\r\nmortal who makes use of the force.\r\n\r\n"I set out on my journey, reached the stream, bounded across it,----"\r\n\r\nA shadow of embarrassment darkened her cheek: I understood it, but\r\nshowed no sign. Checked for the merest moment, she went on:\r\n\r\n"--you know what a step it is in parts!--But in the very act, an\r\nindescribable cold invaded me. I recognised at once the nature of the\r\nassault, and knew it could affect me but temporarily. By sheer force of\r\nwill I dragged myself to the wood--nor knew anything more until I saw\r\nyou asleep, and the horrible worm at your neck. I crept out, dragged the\r\nmonster from you, and laid my lips to the wound. You began to wake; I\r\nburied myself among the leaves."\r\n\r\nShe rose, her eyes flashing as never human eyes flashed, and threw her\r\narms high over her head.\r\n\r\n"What you have made me is yours!" she cried. "I will repay you as never\r\nyet did woman! My power, my beauty, my love are your own: take them."\r\n\r\nShe dropt kneeling beside me, laid her arms across my knees, and looked\r\nup in my face.\r\n\r\nThen first I noted on her left hand a large clumsy glove. In my mind\'s\r\neye I saw hair and claws under it, but I knew it was a hand shut\r\nhard--perhaps badly bruised. I glanced at the other: it was lovely as\r\nhand could be, and I felt that, if I did less than loathe her, I should\r\nlove her. Not to dally with usurping emotions, I turned my eyes aside.\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet. I sat motionless, looking down.\r\n\r\n"To me she may be true!" said my vanity. For a moment I was tempted to\r\nlove a lie.\r\n\r\nAn odour, rather than the gentlest of airy pulses, was fanning me.\r\nI glanced up. She stood erect before me, waving her lovely arms in\r\nseemingly mystic fashion.\r\n\r\nA frightful roar made my heart rebound against the walls of its cage.\r\nThe alabaster trembled as if it would shake into shivers. The princess\r\nshuddered visibly.\r\n\r\n"My wine was too strong for you!" she said, in a quavering voice; "I\r\nought not to have let you take a full draught! Go and sleep now, and\r\nwhen you wake ask me what you please.--I will go with you: come."\r\n\r\nAs she preceded me up the stair,--\r\n\r\n"I do not wonder that roar startled you!" she said. "It startled me, I\r\nconfess: for a moment I feared she had escaped. But that is impossible."\r\n\r\nThe roar seemed to me, however--I could not tell why--to come from the\r\nWHITE leopardess, and to be meant for me, not the princess.\r\n\r\nWith a smile she left me at the door of my room, but as she turned I\r\nread anxiety on her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. A BATTLE ROYAL\r\n\r\nI threw myself on the bed, and began to turn over in my mind the tale\r\nshe had told me. She had forgotten herself, and, by a single incautious\r\nword, removed one perplexity as to the condition in which I found her in\r\nthe forest! The leopardess BOUNDED over; the princess lay prostrate on\r\nthe bank: the running stream had dissolved her self-enchantment! Her own\r\naccount of the object of her journey revealed the danger of the Little\r\nOnes then imminent: I had saved the life of their one fearful enemy!\r\n\r\nI had but reached this conclusion when I fell asleep. The lovely wine\r\nmay not have been quite innocent.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, it was night. A lamp, suspended from the ceiling,\r\ncast a clear, although soft light through the chamber. A delicious\r\nlanguor infolded me. I seemed floating, far from land, upon the bosom of\r\na twilight sea. Existence was in itself pleasure. I had no pain. Surely\r\nI was dying!\r\n\r\nNo pain!--ah, what a shoot of mortal pain was that! what a sickening\r\nsting! It went right through my heart! Again! That was sharpness\r\nitself!--and so sickening! I could not move my hand to lay it on my\r\nheart; something kept it down!\r\n\r\nThe pain was dying away, but my whole body seemed paralysed. Some evil\r\nthing was upon me!--something hateful! I would have struggled, but could\r\nnot reach a struggle. My will agonised, but in vain, to assert itself.\r\nI desisted, and lay passive. Then I became aware of a soft hand on my\r\nface, pressing my head into the pillow, and of a heavy weight lying\r\nacross me.\r\n\r\nI began to breathe more freely; the weight was gone from my chest; I\r\nopened my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe princess was standing above me on the bed, looking out into the\r\nroom, with the air of one who dreamed. Her great eyes were clear and\r\ncalm. Her mouth wore a look of satisfied passion; she wiped from it a\r\nstreak of red.\r\n\r\nShe caught my gaze, bent down, and struck me on the eyes with the\r\nhandkerchief in her hand: it was like drawing the edge of a knife across\r\nthem, and for a moment or two I was blind.\r\n\r\nI heard a dull heavy sound, as of a large soft-footed animal alighting\r\nfrom a little jump. I opened my eyes, and saw the great swing of a long\r\ntail as it disappeared through the half-open doorway. I sprang after it.\r\n\r\nThe creature had vanished quite. I shot down the stair, and into the\r\nhall of alabaster. The moon was high, and the place like the inside of\r\na faint, sun-blanched moon. The princess was not there. I must find her:\r\nin her presence I might protect myself; out of it I could not! I was\r\na tame animal for her to feed upon; a human fountain for a thirst\r\ndemoniac! She showed me favour the more easily to use me! My waking eyes\r\ndid not fear her, but they would close, and she would come! Not seeing\r\nher, I felt her everywhere, for she might be anywhere--might even now\r\nbe waiting me in some secret cavern of sleep! Only with my eyes upon her\r\ncould I feel safe from her!\r\n\r\nOutside the alabaster hall it was pitch-dark, and I had to grope my way\r\nalong with hands and feet. At last I felt a curtain, put it aside, and\r\nentered the black hall. There I found a great silent assembly. How it\r\nwas visible I neither saw nor could imagine, for the walls, the floor,\r\nthe roof, were shrouded in what seemed an infinite blackness, blacker\r\nthan the blackest of moonless, starless nights; yet my eyes could\r\nseparate, although vaguely, not a few of the individuals in the mass\r\ninterpenetrated and divided, as well as surrounded, by the darkness.\r\nIt seemed as if my eyes would never come quite to themselves. I pressed\r\ntheir balls and looked and looked again, but what I saw would not grow\r\ndistinct. Blackness mingled with form, silence and undefined motion\r\npossessed the wide space. All was a dim, confused dance, filled with\r\nrecurrent glimpses of shapes not unknown to me. Now appeared a woman,\r\nwith glorious eyes looking out of a skull; now an armed figure on a\r\nskeleton horse; now one now another of the hideous burrowing phantasms.\r\nI could trace no order and little relation in the mingling and crossing\r\ncurrents and eddies. If I seemed to catch the shape and rhythm of a\r\ndance, it was but to see it break, and confusion prevail. With the\r\nshifting colours of the seemingly more solid shapes, mingled a multitude\r\nof shadows, independent apparently of originals, each moving after\r\nits own free shadow-will. I looked everywhere for the princess, but\r\nthroughout the wildly changing kaleidoscopic scene, could not see her\r\nnor discover indication of her presence. Where was she? What might she\r\nnot be doing? No one took the least notice of me as I wandered hither\r\nand thither seeking her. At length losing hope, I turned away to look\r\nelsewhere. Finding the wall, and keeping to it with my hand, for even\r\nthen I could not see it, I came, groping along, to a curtained opening\r\ninto the vestibule.\r\n\r\nDimly moonlighted, the cage of the leopardess was the arena of what\r\nseemed a desperate although silent struggle. Two vastly differing forms,\r\nhuman and bestial, with entangled confusion of mingling bodies and\r\nlimbs, writhed and wrestled in closest embrace. It had lasted but an\r\ninstant when I saw the leopardess out of the cage, walking quietly to\r\nthe open door. As I hastened after her I threw a glance behind me: there\r\nwas the leopardess in the cage, couching motionless as when I saw her\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe moon, half-way up the sky, was shining round and clear; the bodiless\r\nshadow I had seen the night before, was walking through the trees\r\ntoward the gate; and after him went the leopardess, swinging her tail.\r\nI followed, a little way off, as silently as they, and neither of them\r\nonce looked round. Through the open gate we went down to the city, lying\r\nquiet as the moonshine upon it. The face of the moon was very still, and\r\nits stillness looked like that of expectation.\r\n\r\nThe Shadow took his way straight to the stair at the top of which I had\r\nlain the night before. Without a pause he went up, and the leopardess\r\nfollowed. I quickened my pace, but, a moment after, heard a cry of\r\nhorror. Then came the fall of something soft and heavy between me and\r\nthe stair, and at my feet lay a body, frightfully blackened and crushed,\r\nbut still recognisable as that of the woman who had led me home and shut\r\nme out. As I stood petrified, the spotted leopardess came bounding down\r\nthe stair with a baby in her mouth. I darted to seize her ere she\r\ncould turn at the foot; but that instant, from behind me, the white\r\nleopardess, like a great bar of glowing silver, shot through the\r\nmoonlight, and had her by the neck. She dropped the child; I caught it\r\nup, and stood to watch the battle between them.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight it was--now the one, now the other uppermost, both too\r\nintent for any noise beyond a low growl, a whimpered cry, or a snarl of\r\nhate--followed by a quicker scrambling of claws, as each, worrying\r\nand pushing and dragging, struggled for foothold on the pavement! The\r\nspotted leopardess was larger than the white, and I was anxious for my\r\nfriend; but I soon saw that, though neither stronger nor more active,\r\nthe white leopardess had the greater endurance. Not once did she lose\r\nher hold on the neck of the other. From the spotted throat at length\r\nissued a howl of agony, changing, by swift-crowded gradations, into the\r\nlong-drawn CRESCENDO of a woman\'s uttermost wail. The white one relaxed\r\nher jaws; the spotted one drew herself away, and rose on her hind legs.\r\nErect in the moonlight stood the princess, a confused rush of shadows\r\ncareering over her whiteness--the spots of the leopard crowding,\r\nhurrying, fleeing to the refuge of her eyes, where merging they\r\nvanished. The last few, outsped and belated, mingled with the cloud\r\nof her streamy hair, leaving her radiant as the moon when a legion of\r\nlittle vapours has flown, wind-hunted, off her silvery disc--save that,\r\nadown the white column of her throat, a thread of blood still trickled\r\nfrom every wound of her adversary\'s terrible teeth. She turned away,\r\ntook a few steps with the gait of a Hecate, fell, covered afresh with\r\nher spots, and fled at a long, stretching gallop.\r\n\r\nThe white leopardess turned also, sprang upon me, pulled my arms\r\nasunder, caught the baby as it fell, and flew with it along the street\r\ntoward the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE SILENT FOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nI turned and followed the spotted leopardess, catching but one glimpse\r\nof her as she tore up the brow of the hill to the gate of the palace.\r\nWhen I reached the entrance-hall, the princess was just throwing the\r\nrobe around her which she had left on the floor. The blood had ceased to\r\nflow from her wounds, and had dried in the wind of her flight.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw me, a flash of anger crossed her face, and she turned her\r\nhead aside. Then, with an attempted smile, she looked at me, and said,\r\n\r\n"I have met with a small accident! Happening to hear that the cat-woman\r\nwas again in the city, I went down to send her away. But she had one of\r\nher horrid creatures with her: it sprang upon me, and had its claws in\r\nmy neck before I could strike it!"\r\n\r\nShe gave a shiver, and I could not help pitying her, although I knew\r\nshe lied, for her wounds were real, and her face reminded me of how she\r\nlooked in the cave. My heart began to reproach me that I had let her\r\nfight unaided, and I suppose I looked the compassion I felt.\r\n\r\n"Child of folly!" she said, with another attempted smile, "--not crying,\r\nsurely!--Wait for me here; I am going into the black hall for a moment.\r\nI want you to get me something for my scratches."\r\n\r\nBut I followed her close. Out of my sight I feared her.\r\n\r\nThe instant the princess entered, I heard a buzzing sound as of many\r\nlow voices, and, one portion after another, the assembly began to be\r\nshiftingly illuminated, as by a ray that went travelling from spot to\r\nspot. Group after group would shine out for a space, then sink back into\r\nthe general vagueness, while another part of the vast company would grow\r\nmomently bright.\r\n\r\nSome of the actions going on when thus illuminated, were not unknown to\r\nme; I had been in them, or had looked on them, and so had the princess:\r\npresent with every one of them I now saw her. The skull-headed dancers\r\nfooted the grass in the forest-hall: there was the princess looking in\r\nat the door! The fight went on in the Evil Wood: there was the princess\r\nurging it! Yet I was close behind her all the time, she standing\r\nmotionless, her head sunk on her bosom. The confused murmur continued,\r\nthe confused commotion of colours and shapes; and still the ray went\r\nshifting and showing. It settled at last on the hollow in the heath, and\r\nthere was the princess, walking up and down, and trying in vain to wrap\r\nthe vapour around her! Then first I was startled at what I saw: the old\r\nlibrarian walked up to her, and stood for a moment regarding her; she\r\nfell; her limbs forsook her and fled; her body vanished.\r\n\r\nA wild shriek rang through the echoing place, and with the fall of her\r\neidolon, the princess herself, till then standing like a statue in front\r\nof me, fell heavily, and lay still. I turned at once and went out: not\r\nagain would I seek to restore her! As I stood trembling beside the\r\ncage, I knew that in the black ellipsoid I had been in the brain of the\r\nprincess!--I saw the tail of the leopardess quiver once.\r\n\r\nWhile still endeavouring to compose myself, I heard the voice of the\r\nprincess beside me.\r\n\r\n"Come now," she said; "I will show you what I want you to do for me."\r\n\r\nShe led the way into the court. I followed in dazed compliance.\r\n\r\nThe moon was near the zenith, and her present silver seemed brighter\r\nthan the gold of the absent sun. She brought me through the trees to the\r\ntallest of them, the one in the centre. It was not quite like the rest,\r\nfor its branches, drawing their ends together at the top, made a clump\r\nthat looked from beneath like a fir-cone. The princess stood close under\r\nit, gazing up, and said, as if talking to herself,\r\n\r\n"On the summit of that tree grows a tiny blossom which would at once\r\nheal my scratches! I might be a dove for a moment and fetch it, but I\r\nsee a little snake in the leaves whose bite would be worse to a dove\r\nthan the bite of a tiger to me!--How I hate that cat-woman!"\r\n\r\nShe turned to me quickly, saying with one of her sweetest smiles,\r\n\r\n"Can you climb?"\r\n\r\nThe smile vanished with the brief question, and her face changed to a\r\nlook of sadness and suffering. I ought to have left her to suffer, but\r\nthe way she put her hand to her wounded neck went to my heart.\r\n\r\nI considered the tree. All the way up to the branches, were projections\r\non the stem like the remnants on a palm of its fallen leaves.\r\n\r\n"I can climb that tree," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Not with bare feet!" she returned.\r\n\r\nIn my haste to follow the leopardess disappearing, I had left my sandals\r\nin my room.\r\n\r\n"It is no matter," I said; "I have long gone barefoot!"\r\n\r\nAgain I looked at the tree, and my eyes went wandering up the stem until\r\nmy sight lost itself in the branches. The moon shone like silvery\r\nfoam here and there on the rugged bole, and a little rush of wind went\r\nthrough the top with a murmurous sound as of water falling softly into\r\nwater. I approached the tree to begin my ascent of it. The princess\r\nstopped me.\r\n\r\n"I cannot let you attempt it with your feet bare!" she insisted. "A fall\r\nfrom the top would kill you!"\r\n\r\n"So would a bite from the snake!" I answered--not believing, I confess,\r\nthat there was any snake.\r\n\r\n"It would not hurt YOU!" she replied. "--Wait a moment."\r\n\r\nShe tore from her garment the two wide borders that met in front, and\r\nkneeling on one knee, made me put first my left foot, then my right on\r\nthe other, and bound them about with the thick embroidered strips.\r\n\r\n"You have left the ends hanging, princess!" I said.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to cut them off with; but they are not long enough to\r\nget entangled," she replied.\r\n\r\nI turned to the tree, and began to climb.\r\n\r\nNow in Bulika the cold after sundown was not so great as in certain\r\nother parts of the country--especially about the sexton\'s cottage; yet\r\nwhen I had climbed a little way, I began to feel very cold, grew still\r\ncolder as I ascended, and became coldest of all when I got among the\r\nbranches. Then I shivered, and seemed to have lost my hands and feet.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any wind, and the branches did not sway in the\r\nleast, yet, as I approached the summit, I became aware of a peculiar\r\nunsteadiness: every branch on which I placed foot or laid hold, seemed\r\non the point of giving way. When my head rose above the branches\r\nnear the top, and in the open moonlight I began to look about for the\r\nblossom, that instant I found myself drenched from head to foot. The\r\nnext, as if plunged in a stormy water, I was flung about wildly, and\r\nfelt myself sinking. Tossed up and down, tossed this way and tossed that\r\nway, rolled over and over, checked, rolled the other way and tossed up\r\nagain, I was sinking lower and lower. Gasping and gurgling and choking,\r\nI fell at last upon a solid bottom.\r\n\r\n"I told you so!" croaked a voice in my ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. I AM SILENCED\r\n\r\nI rubbed the water out of my eyes, and saw the raven on the edge of a\r\nhuge stone basin. With the cold light of the dawn reflected from his\r\nglossy plumage, he stood calmly looking down upon me. I lay on my back\r\nin water, above which, leaning on my elbows, I just lifted my face. I\r\nwas in the basin of the large fountain constructed by my father in the\r\nmiddle of the lawn. High over me glimmered the thick, steel-shiny stalk,\r\nshooting, with a torrent uprush, a hundred feet into the air, to spread\r\nin a blossom of foam.\r\n\r\nNettled at the coolness of the raven\'s remark,\r\n\r\n"You told me nothing!" I said.\r\n\r\n"I told you to do nothing any one you distrusted asked you!"\r\n\r\n"Tut! how was mortal to remember that?"\r\n\r\n"You will not forget the consequences of having forgotten it!" replied\r\nMr. Raven, who stood leaning over the margin of the basin, and stretched\r\nhis hand across to me.\r\n\r\nI took it, and was immediately beside him on the lawn, dripping and\r\nstreaming.\r\n\r\n"You must change your clothes at once!" he said. "A wetting does not\r\nsignify where you come from--though at present such an accident is\r\nunusual; here it has its inconveniences!"\r\n\r\nHe was again a raven, walking, with something stately in his step,\r\ntoward the house, the door of which stood open.\r\n\r\n"I have not much to change!" I laughed; for I had flung aside my robe to\r\nclimb the tree.\r\n\r\n"It is a long time since I moulted a feather!" said the raven.\r\n\r\nIn the house no one seemed awake. I went to my room, found a\r\ndressing-gown, and descended to the library.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, the librarian came from the closet. I threw myself on a\r\ncouch. Mr. Raven drew a chair to my side and sat down. For a minute or\r\ntwo neither spoke. I was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n"What does it all mean?" I said.\r\n\r\n"A good question!" he rejoined: "nobody knows what anything is; a man\r\ncan learn only what a thing means! Whether he do, depends on the use he\r\nis making of it."\r\n\r\n"I have made no use of anything yet!"\r\n\r\n"Not much; but you know the fact, and that is something! Most people\r\ntake more than a lifetime to learn that they have learned nothing, and\r\ndone less! At least you have not been without the desire to be of use!"\r\n\r\n"I did want to do something for the children--the precious Little Ones,\r\nI mean."\r\n\r\n"I know you did--and started the wrong way!"\r\n\r\n"I did not know the right way."\r\n\r\n"That is true also--but you are to blame that you did not."\r\n\r\n"I am ready to believe whatever you tell me--as soon as I understand\r\nwhat it means."\r\n\r\n"Had you accepted our invitation, you would have known the right way.\r\nWhen a man will not act where he is, he must go far to find his work."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have gone far, and got nowhere, for I have not found my work!\r\nI left the children to learn how to serve them, and have only learned\r\nthe danger they are in."\r\n\r\n"When you were with them, you were where you could help them: you left\r\nyour work to look for it! It takes a wise man to know when to go away; a\r\nfool may learn to go back at once!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean, sir, I could have done something for the Little Ones by\r\nstaying with them?"\r\n\r\n"Could you teach them anything by leaving them?"\r\n\r\n"No; but how could I teach them? I did not know how to begin. Besides,\r\nthey were far ahead of me!"\r\n\r\n"That is true. But you were not a rod to measure them with! Certainly,\r\nif they knew what you know, not to say what you might have known, they\r\nwould be ahead of you--out of sight ahead! but you saw they were not\r\ngrowing--or growing so slowly that they had not yet developed the\r\nidea of growing! they were even afraid of growing!--You had never seen\r\nchildren remain children!"\r\n\r\n"But surely I had no power to make them grow!"\r\n\r\n"You might have removed some of the hindrances to their growing!"\r\n\r\n"What are they? I do not know them. I did think perhaps it was the want\r\nof water!"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is! they have none to cry with!"\r\n\r\n"I would gladly have kept them from requiring any for that purpose!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt you would--the aim of all stupid philanthropists! Why, Mr.\r\nVane, but for the weeping in it, your world would never have become\r\nworth saving! You confess you thought it might be water they wanted: why\r\ndid not you dig them a well or two?"\r\n\r\n"That never entered my mind!"\r\n\r\n"Not when the sounds of the waters under the earth entered your ears?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it did once. But I was afraid of the giants for them. That\r\nwas what made me bear so much from the brutes myself!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed you almost taught the noble little creatures to be afraid of the\r\nstupid Bags! While they fed and comforted and worshipped you, all the\r\ntime you submitted to be the slave of bestial men! You gave the darlings\r\na seeming coward for their hero! A worse wrong you could hardly have\r\ndone them. They gave you their hearts; you owed them your soul!--You\r\nmight by this time have made the Bags hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater to the Little Ones!"\r\n\r\n"I fear what you say is true, Mr. Raven! But indeed I was afraid that\r\nmore knowledge might prove an injury to them--render them less innocent,\r\nless lovely."\r\n\r\n"They had given you no reason to harbour such a fear!"\r\n\r\n"Is not a little knowledge a dangerous thing?"\r\n\r\n"That is one of the pet falsehoods of your world! Is man\'s greatest\r\nknowledge more than a little? or is it therefore dangerous? The fancy\r\nthat knowledge is in itself a great thing, would make any degree of\r\nknowledge more dangerous than any amount of ignorance. To know all\r\nthings would not be greatness."\r\n\r\n"At least it was for love of them, not from cowardice that I served the\r\ngiants!"\r\n\r\n"Granted. But you ought to have served the Little Ones, not the giants!\r\nYou ought to have given the Little Ones water; then they would soon\r\nhave taught the giants their true position. In the meantime you could\r\nyourself have made the giants cut down two-thirds of their coarse\r\nfruit-trees to give room to the little delicate ones! You lost your\r\nchance with the Lovers, Mr. Vane! You speculated about them instead of\r\nhelping them!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE PERSIAN CAT\r\n\r\nI sat in silence and shame. What he said was true: I had not been a wise\r\nneighbour to the Little Ones!\r\n\r\nMr. Raven resumed:\r\n\r\n"You wronged at the same time the stupid creatures themselves. For them\r\nslavery would have been progress. To them a few such lessons as you\r\ncould have given them with a stick from one of their own trees, would\r\nhave been invaluable."\r\n\r\n"I did not know they were cowards!"\r\n\r\n"What difference does that make? The man who grounds his action on\r\nanother\'s cowardice, is essentially a coward himself.--I fear worse will\r\ncome of it! By this time the Little Ones might have been able to protect\r\nthemselves from the princess, not to say the giants--they were always\r\nfit enough for that; as it was they laughed at them! but now, through\r\nyour relations with her,----"\r\n\r\n"I hate her!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Did you let her know you hated her?"\r\n\r\nAgain I was silent.\r\n\r\n"Not even to her have you been faithful!--But hush! we were followed\r\nfrom the fountain, I fear!"\r\n\r\n"No living creature did I see!--except a disreputable-looking cat that\r\nbolted into the shrubbery."\r\n\r\n"It was a magnificent Persian--so wet and draggled, though, as to look\r\nwhat she was--worse than disreputable!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Mr. Raven?" I cried, a fresh horror taking me by the\r\nthroat. "--There was a beautiful blue Persian about the house, but\r\nshe fled at the very sound of water!--Could she have been after the\r\ngoldfish?"\r\n\r\n"We shall see!" returned the librarian. "I know a little about cats of\r\nseveral sorts, and there is that in the room which will unmask this one,\r\nor I am mistaken in her."\r\n\r\nHe rose, went to the door of the closet, brought from it the mutilated\r\nvolume, and sat down again beside me. I stared at the book in his hand:\r\nit was a whole book, entire and sound!\r\n\r\n"Where was the other half of it?" I gasped.\r\n\r\n"Sticking through into my library," he answered.\r\n\r\nI held my peace. A single question more would have been a plunge into a\r\nbottomless sea, and there might be no time!\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said: "I am going to read a stanza or two. There is one\r\npresent who, I imagine, will hardly enjoy the reading!"\r\n\r\nHe opened the vellum cover, and turned a leaf or two. The parchment was\r\ndiscoloured with age, and one leaf showed a dark stain over two-thirds\r\nof it. He slowly turned this also, and seemed looking for a certain\r\npassage in what appeared a continuous poem. Somewhere about the middle\r\nof the book he began to read.\r\n\r\nBut what follows represents--not what he read, only the impression it\r\nmade upon me. The poem seemed in a language I had never before heard,\r\nwhich yet I understood perfectly, although I could not write the words,\r\nor give their meaning save in poor approximation. These fragments, then,\r\nare the shapes which those he read have finally taken in passing again\r\nthrough my brain:--\r\n\r\n     "But if I found a man that could believe\r\n        In what he saw not, felt not, and yet knew,\r\n      From him I should take substance, and receive\r\n        Firmness and form relate to touch and view;\r\n        Then should I clothe me in the likeness true\r\n      Of that idea where his soul did cleave!"\r\n\r\nHe turned a leaf and read again:--\r\n\r\n     "In me was every woman.  I had power\r\n        Over the soul of every living man,\r\n      Such as no woman ever had in dower--\r\n        Could what no woman ever could, or can;\r\n        All women, I, the woman, still outran,\r\n      Outsoared, outsank, outreigned, in hall or bower.\r\n\r\n     "For I, though me he neither saw nor heard,\r\n        Nor with his hand could touch finger of mine,\r\n      Although not once my breath had ever stirred\r\n        A hair of him, could trammel brain and spine\r\n        With rooted bonds which Death could not untwine--\r\n      Or life, though hope were evermore deferred."\r\n\r\nAgain he paused, again turned a leaf, and again began:--\r\n\r\n     "For by his side I lay, a bodiless thing;\r\n        I breathed not, saw not, felt not, only thought,\r\n      And made him love me--with a hungering\r\n        After he knew not what--if it was aught\r\n        Or but a nameless something that was wrought\r\n      By him out of himself; for I did sing\r\n\r\n     "A song that had no sound into his soul;\r\n        I lay a heartless thing against his heart,\r\n      Giving him nothing where he gave his whole\r\n        Being to clothe me human, every part:\r\n        That I at last into his sense might dart,\r\n      Thus first into his living mind I stole.\r\n\r\n     "Ah, who was ever conquering Love but I!\r\n        Who else did ever throne in heart of man!\r\n      To visible being, with a gladsome cry\r\n        Waking, life\'s tremor through me throbbing ran!"\r\n\r\nA strange, repulsive feline wail arose somewhere in the room. I started\r\nup on my elbow and stared about me, but could see nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Raven turned several leaves, and went on:--\r\n\r\n     "Sudden I woke, nor knew the ghastly fear\r\n        That held me--not like serpent coiled about,\r\n      But like a vapour moist, corrupt, and drear,\r\n        Filling heart, soul, and breast and brain throughout;\r\n        My being lay motionless in sickening doubt,\r\n      Nor dared to ask how came the horror here.\r\n\r\n     "My past entire I knew, but not my now;\r\n        I understood nor what I was, nor where;\r\n      I knew what I had been: still on my brow\r\n        I felt the touch of what no more was there!\r\n        I was a fainting, dead, yet live Despair;\r\n      A life that flouted life with mop and mow!\r\n\r\n     "That I was a queen I knew right well,\r\n        And sometimes wore a splendour on my head\r\n      Whose flashing even dead darkness could not quell--\r\n        The like on neck and arms and girdle-stead;\r\n        And men declared a light my closed eyes shed\r\n      That killed the diamond in its silver cell."\r\n\r\nAgain I heard the ugly cry of feline pain. Again I looked, but saw\r\nneither shape nor motion. Mr. Raven seemed to listen a moment, but again\r\nturned several pages, and resumed:--\r\n\r\n     "Hideously wet, my hair of golden hue\r\n        Fouled my fair hands: to have it swiftly shorn\r\n      I had given my rubies, all for me dug new--\r\n        No eyes had seen, and such no waist had worn!\r\n        For a draught of water from a drinking horn,\r\n      For one blue breath, I had given my sapphires blue!\r\n\r\n     "Nay, I had given my opals for a smock,\r\n        A peasant-maiden\'s garment, coarse and clean:\r\n      My shroud was rotting!  Once I heard a cock\r\n        Lustily crow upon the hillock green\r\n        Over my coffin.  Dulled by space between,\r\n      Came back an answer like a ghostly mock."\r\n\r\nOnce more arose the bestial wail.\r\n\r\n"I thought some foul thing was in the room!" said the librarian, casting\r\na glance around him; but instantly he turned a leaf or two, and again\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n     "For I had bathed in milk and honey-dew,\r\n        In rain from roses shook, that ne\'er touched earth,\r\n      And ointed me with nard of amber hue;\r\n        Never had spot me spotted from my birth,\r\n        Or mole, or scar of hurt, or fret of dearth;\r\n      Never one hair superfluous on me grew.\r\n\r\n     "Fleeing cold whiteness, I would sit alone--\r\n        Not in the sun--I feared his bronzing light,\r\n      But in his radiance back around me thrown\r\n        By fulgent mirrors tempering his might;\r\n        Thus bathing in a moon-bath not too bright,\r\n      My skin I tinted slow to ivory tone.\r\n\r\n     "But now, all round was dark, dark all within!\r\n        My eyes not even gave out a phantom-flash;\r\n      My fingers sank in pulp through pulpy skin;\r\n        My body lay death-weltered in a mash\r\n        Of slimy horrors----"\r\n\r\nWith a fearsome yell, her clammy fur staring in clumps, her tail thick\r\nas a cable, her eyes flashing green as a chrysoprase, her distended\r\nclaws entangling themselves so that she floundered across the carpet, a\r\nhuge white cat rushed from somewhere, and made for the chimney. Quick as\r\nthought the librarian threw the manuscript between her and the hearth.\r\nShe crouched instantly, her eyes fixed on the book. But his voice went\r\non as if still he read, and his eyes seemed also fixed on the book:--\r\n\r\n     "Ah, the two worlds! so strangely are they one,\r\n        And yet so measurelessly wide apart!\r\n      Oh, had I lived the bodiless alone\r\n        And from defiling sense held safe my heart,\r\n        Then had I scaped the canker and the smart,\r\n      Scaped life-in-death, scaped misery\'s endless moan!"\r\n\r\nAt these words such a howling, such a prolonged yell of agony burst from\r\nthe cat, that we both stopped our ears. When it ceased, Mr. Raven walked\r\nto the fire-place, took up the book, and, standing between the creature\r\nand the chimney, pointed his finger at her for a moment. She lay\r\nperfectly still. He took a half-burnt stick from the hearth, drew with\r\nit some sign on the floor, put the manuscript back in its place, with a\r\nlook that seemed to say, "Now we have her, I think!" and, returning to\r\nthe cat, stood over her and said, in a still, solemn voice:--\r\n\r\n"Lilith, when you came here on the way to your evil will, you little\r\nthought into whose hands you were delivering yourself!--Mr. Vane, when\r\nGod created me,--not out of Nothing, as say the unwise, but out of His\r\nown endless glory--He brought me an angelic splendour to be my wife:\r\nthere she lies! For her first thought was POWER; she counted it slavery\r\nto be one with me, and bear children for Him who gave her being. One\r\nchild, indeed, she bore; then, puffed with the fancy that she had\r\ncreated her, would have me fall down and worship her! Finding, however,\r\nthat I would but love and honour, never obey and worship her, she poured\r\nout her blood to escape me, fled to the army of the aliens, and soon\r\nhad so ensnared the heart of the great Shadow, that he became her slave,\r\nwrought her will, and made her queen of Hell. How it is with her now,\r\nshe best knows, but I know also. The one child of her body she fears and\r\nhates, and would kill, asserting a right, which is a lie, over what God\r\nsent through her into His new world. Of creating, she knows no more than\r\nthe crystal that takes its allotted shape, or the worm that makes two\r\nworms when it is cloven asunder. Vilest of God\'s creatures, she lives\r\nby the blood and lives and souls of men. She consumes and slays, but is\r\npowerless to destroy as to create."\r\n\r\nThe animal lay motionless, its beryl eyes fixed flaming on the man: his\r\neyes on hers held them fixed that they could not move from his.\r\n\r\n"Then God gave me another wife--not an angel but a woman--who is to this\r\nas light is to darkness."\r\n\r\nThe cat gave a horrible screech, and began to grow bigger. She went on\r\ngrowing and growing. At last the spotted leopardess uttered a roar that\r\nmade the house tremble. I sprang to my feet. I do not think Mr. Raven\r\nstarted even with his eyelids.\r\n\r\n"It is but her jealousy that speaks," he said, "jealousy self-kindled,\r\nfoiled and fruitless; for here I am, her master now whom she, would\r\nnot have for her husband! while my beautiful Eve yet lives, hoping\r\nimmortally! Her hated daughter lives also, but beyond her evil ken,\r\none day to be what she counts her destruction--for even Lilith shall\r\nbe saved by her childbearing. Meanwhile she exults that my human wife\r\nplunged herself and me in despair, and has borne me a countless race of\r\nmiserables; but my Eve repented, and is now beautiful as never was woman\r\nor angel, while her groaning, travailing world is the nursery of our\r\nFather\'s children. I too have repented, and am blessed.--Thou, Lilith,\r\nhast not yet repented; but thou must.--Tell me, is the great\r\nShadow beautiful? Knowest thou how long thou wilt thyself remain\r\nbeautiful?--Answer me, if thou knowest."\r\n\r\nThen at last I understood that Mr. Raven was indeed Adam, the old and\r\nthe new man; and that his wife, ministering in the house of the dead,\r\nwas Eve, the mother of us all, the lady of the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe leopardess reared; the flickering and fleeing of her spots began;\r\nthe princess at length stood radiant in her perfect shape.\r\n\r\n"I AM beautiful--and immortal!" she said--and she looked the goddess she\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\n"As a bush that burns, and is consumed," answered he who had been her\r\nhusband. "--What is that under thy right hand?"\r\n\r\nFor her arm lay across her bosom, and her hand was pressed to her side.\r\n\r\nA swift pang contorted her beautiful face, and passed.\r\n\r\n"It is but a leopard-spot that lingers! it will quickly follow those I\r\nhave dismissed," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Thou art beautiful because God created thee, but thou art the slave of\r\nsin: take thy hand from thy side."\r\n\r\nHer hand sank away, and as it dropt she looked him in the eyes with a\r\nquailing fierceness that had in it no surrender.\r\n\r\nHe gazed a moment at the spot.\r\n\r\n"It is not on the leopard; it is in the woman!" he said. "Nor will it\r\nleave thee until it hath eaten to thy heart, and thy beauty hath flowed\r\nfrom thee through the open wound!"\r\n\r\nShe gave a glance downward, and shivered.\r\n\r\n"Lilith," said Adam, and his tone had changed to a tender beseeching,\r\n"hear me, and repent, and He who made thee will cleanse thee!"\r\n\r\nHer hand returned quivering to her side. Her face grew dark. She gave\r\nthe cry of one from whom hope is vanishing. The cry passed into a howl.\r\nShe lay writhing on the floor, a leopardess covered with spots.\r\n\r\n"The evil thou meditatest," Adam resumed, "thou shalt never compass,\r\nLilith, for Good and not Evil is the Universe. The battle between them\r\nmay last for countless ages, but it must end: how will it fare with\r\nthee when Time hath vanished in the dawn of the eternal morn? Repent, I\r\nbeseech thee; repent, and be again an angel of God!"\r\n\r\nShe rose, she stood upright, a woman once more, and said,\r\n\r\n"I will not repent. I will drink the blood of thy child." My eyes were\r\nfastened on the princess; but when Adam spoke, I turned to him: he stood\r\ntowering above her; the form of his visage was altered, and his voice\r\nwas terrible.\r\n\r\n"Down!" he cried; "or by the power given me I will melt thy very bones."\r\n\r\nShe flung herself on the floor, dwindled and dwindled, and was again a\r\ngray cat. Adam caught her up by the skin of her neck, bore her to\r\nthe closet, and threw her in. He described a strange figure on the\r\nthreshold, and closing the door, locked it.\r\n\r\nThen he returned to my side the old librarian, looking sad and worn, and\r\nfurtively wiping tears from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. ADAM EXPLAINS\r\n\r\n"We must be on our guard," he said, "or she will again outwit us. She\r\nwould befool the very elect!"\r\n\r\n"How are we to be on our guard?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Every way," he answered. "She fears, therefore hates her child, and is\r\nin this house on her way to destroy her. The birth of children is in her\r\neyes the death of their parents, and every new generation the enemy of\r\nthe last. Her daughter appears to her an open channel through which her\r\nimmortality--which yet she counts self-inherent--is flowing fast away:\r\nto fill it up, almost from her birth she has pursued her with an utter\r\nenmity. But the result of her machinations hitherto is, that in the\r\nregion she claims as her own, has appeared a colony of children, to\r\nwhich that daughter is heart and head and sheltering wings. My Eve\r\nlonged after the child, and would have been to her as a mother to her\r\nfirst-born, but we were then unfit to train her: she was carried into\r\nthe wilderness, and for ages we knew nothing of her fate. But she was\r\ndivinely fostered, and had young angels for her playmates; nor did she\r\never know care until she found a baby in the wood, and the mother-heart\r\nin her awoke. One by one she has found many children since, and that\r\nheart is not yet full. Her family is her absorbing charge, and never\r\nchildren were better mothered. Her authority over them is without\r\nappeal, but it is unknown to herself, and never comes to the surface\r\nexcept in watchfulness and service. She has forgotten the time when she\r\nlived without them, and thinks she came herself from the wood, the first\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\n"You have saved the life of her and their enemy; therefore your life\r\nbelongs to her and them. The princess was on her way to destroy them,\r\nbut as she crossed that stream, vengeance overtook her, and she would\r\nhave died had you not come to her aid. You did; and ere now she would\r\nhave been raging among the Little Ones, had she dared again cross the\r\nstream. But there was yet a way to the blessed little colony through the\r\nworld of the three dimensions; only, from that, by the slaying of her\r\nformer body, she had excluded herself, and except in personal contact\r\nwith one belonging to it, could not re-enter it. You provided the\r\nopportunity: never, in all her long years, had she had one before. Her\r\nhand, with lightest touch, was on one or other of your muffled feet,\r\nevery step as you climbed. In that little chamber, she is now watching\r\nto leave it as soon as ever she may."\r\n\r\n"She cannot know anything about the door!--she cannot at least know how\r\nto open it!" I said; but my heart was not so confident as my words.\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush!" whispered the librarian, with uplifted hand; "she can hear\r\nthrough anything!--You must go at once, and make your way to my wife\'s\r\ncottage. I will remain to keep guard over her."\r\n\r\n"Let me go to the Little Ones!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Beware of that, Mr. Vane. Go to my wife, and do as she tells you."\r\n\r\nHis advice did not recommend itself: why haste to encounter measureless\r\ndelay? If not to protect the children, why go at all? Alas, even now I\r\nbelieved him only enough to ask him questions, not to obey him!\r\n\r\n"Tell me first, Mr. Raven," I said, "why, of all places, you have shut\r\nher up there! The night I ran from your house, it was immediately into\r\nthat closet!"\r\n\r\n"The closet is no nearer our cottage, and no farther from it, than any\r\nor every other place."\r\n\r\n"But," I returned, hard to persuade where I could not understand, "how\r\nis it then that, when you please, you take from that same door a whole\r\nbook where I saw and felt only a part of one? The other part, you have\r\njust told me, stuck through into your library: when you put it again on\r\nthe shelf, will it not again stick through into that? Must not then the\r\ntwo places, in which parts of the same volume can at the same moment\r\nexist, lie close together? Or can one part of the book be in space, or\r\nSOMEWHERE, and the other out of space, or NOWHERE?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I cannot explain the thing to you," he answered; "but there\r\nis no provision in you for understanding it. Not merely, therefore,\r\nis the phenomenon inexplicable to you, but the very nature of it is\r\ninapprehensible by you. Indeed I but partially apprehend it myself. At\r\nthe same time you are constantly experiencing things which you not only\r\ndo not, but cannot understand. You think you understand them, but your\r\nunderstanding of them is only your being used to them, and therefore not\r\nsurprised at them. You accept them, not because you understand them,\r\nbut because you must accept them: they are there, and have unavoidable\r\nrelations with you! The fact is, no man understands anything; when he\r\nknows he does not understand, that is his first tottering step--not\r\ntoward understanding, but toward the capability of one day\r\nunderstanding. To such things as these you are not used, therefore you\r\ndo not fancy you understand them. Neither I nor any man can here help\r\nyou to understand; but I may, perhaps, help you a little to believe!"\r\n\r\nHe went to the door of the closet, gave a low whistle, and stood\r\nlistening. A moment after, I heard, or seemed to hear, a soft whir of\r\nwings, and, looking up, saw a white dove perch for an instant on the top\r\nof the shelves over the portrait, thence drop to Mr. Raven\'s shoulder,\r\nand lay her head against his cheek. Only by the motions of their two\r\nheads could I tell that they were talking together; I heard nothing.\r\nNeither had I moved my eyes from them, when suddenly she was not there,\r\nand Mr. Raven came back to his seat.\r\n\r\n"Why did you whistle?" I asked. "Surely sound here is not sound there!"\r\n\r\n"You are right," he answered. "I whistled that you might know I called\r\nher. Not the whistle, but what the whistle meant reached her.--There is\r\nnot a minute to lose: you must go!"\r\n\r\n"I will at once!" I replied, and moved for the door.\r\n\r\n"You will sleep to-night at my hostelry!" he said--not as a question,\r\nbut in a tone of mild authority.\r\n\r\n"My heart is with the children," I replied. "But if you insist----"\r\n\r\n"I do insist. You can otherwise effect nothing.--I will go with you as\r\nfar as the mirror, and see you off."\r\n\r\nHe rose. There came a sudden shock in the closet. Apparently the\r\nleopardess had flung herself against the heavy door. I looked at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"Come; come!" he said.\r\n\r\nEre we reached the door of the library, a howling yell came after\r\nus, mingled with the noise of claws that scored at the hard oak. I\r\nhesitated, and half turned.\r\n\r\n"To think of her lying there alone," I murmured, "--with that terrible\r\nwound!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing will ever close that wound," he answered, with a sigh. "It must\r\neat into her heart! Annihilation itself is no death to evil. Only good\r\nwhere evil was, is evil dead. An evil thing must live with its evil\r\nuntil it chooses to be good. That alone is the slaying of evil."\r\n\r\nI held my peace until a sound I did not understand overtook us.\r\n\r\n"If she should break loose!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Make haste!" he rejoined. "I shall hurry down the moment you are gone,\r\nand I have disarranged the mirrors."\r\n\r\nWe ran, and reached the wooden chamber breathless. Mr. Raven seized the\r\nchains and adjusted the hood. Then he set the mirrors in their proper\r\nrelation, and came beside me in front of the standing one. Already I saw\r\nthe mountain range emerging from the mist.\r\n\r\nBetween us, wedging us asunder, darted, with the yell of a demon, the\r\nhuge bulk of the spotted leopardess. She leaped through the mirror as\r\nthrough an open window, and settled at once into a low, even, swift\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nI cast a look of dismay at my companion, and sprang through to follow\r\nher. He came after me leisurely.\r\n\r\n"You need not run," he called; "you cannot overtake her. This is our\r\nway."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n"She has more magic at her finger-tips than I care to know!" he added\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n"We must do what we can!" I said, and ran on, but sickening as I saw her\r\ndwindle in the distance, stopped, and went back to him.\r\n\r\n"Doubtless we must," he answered. "But my wife has warned Mara, and she\r\nwill do her part; you must sleep first: you have given me your word!"\r\n\r\n"Nor do I mean to break it. But surely sleep is not the first thing!\r\nSurely, surely, action takes precedence of repose!"\r\n\r\n"A man can do nothing he is not fit to do.--See! did I not tell you Mara\r\nwould do her part?"\r\n\r\nI looked whither he pointed, and saw a white spot moving at an acute\r\nangle with the line taken by the leopardess.\r\n\r\n"There she is!" he cried. "The spotted leopardess is strong, but the\r\nwhite is stronger!"\r\n\r\n"I have seen them fight: the combat did not appear decisive as to that."\r\n\r\n"How should such eyes tell which have never slept? The princess did\r\nnot confess herself beaten--that she never does--but she fled! When she\r\nconfesses her last hope gone, that it is indeed hard to kick against\r\nthe goad, then will her day begin to dawn! Come; come! He who cannot act\r\nmust make haste to sleep!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. THE SEXTON\'S OLD HORSE\r\n\r\nI stood and watched the last gleam of the white leopardess melt away,\r\nthen turned to follow my guide--but reluctantly. What had I to do with\r\nsleep? Surely reason was the same in every world, and what reason could\r\nthere be in going to sleep with the dead, when the hour was calling the\r\nlive man? Besides, no one would wake me, and how could I be certain of\r\nwaking early--of waking at all?--the sleepers in that house let morning\r\nglide into noon, and noon into night, nor ever stirred! I murmured, but\r\nfollowed, for I knew not what else to do.\r\n\r\nThe librarian walked on in silence, and I walked silent as he. Time and\r\nspace glided past us. The sun set; it began to grow dark, and I felt in\r\nthe air the spreading cold of the chamber of death. My heart sank lower\r\nand lower. I began to lose sight of the lean, long-coated figure, and at\r\nlength could no more hear his swishing stride through the heather.\r\nBut then I heard instead the slow-flapping wings of the raven; and, at\r\nintervals, now a firefly, now a gleaming butterfly rose into the rayless\r\nair.\r\n\r\nBy and by the moon appeared, slow crossing the far horizon.\r\n\r\n"You are tired, are you not, Mr. Vane?" said the raven, alighting on a\r\nstone. "You must make acquaintance with the horse that will carry you in\r\nthe morning!"\r\n\r\nHe gave a strange whistle through his long black beak. A spot appeared\r\non the face of the half-risen moon. To my ears came presently the\r\ndrumming of swift, soft-galloping hoofs, and in a minute or two, out of\r\nthe very disc of the moon, low-thundered the terrible horse. His mane\r\nflowed away behind him like the crest of a wind-fighting wave, torn\r\nseaward in hoary spray, and the whisk of his tail kept blinding the eye\r\nof the moon. Nineteen hands he seemed, huge of bone, tight of skin, hard\r\nof muscle--a steed the holy Death himself might choose on which to ride\r\nabroad and slay! The moon seemed to regard him with awe; in her scary\r\nlight he looked a very skeleton, loosely roped together. Terrifically\r\nlarge, he moved with the lightness of a winged insect. As he drew near,\r\nhis speed slackened, and his mane and tail drifted about him settling.\r\n\r\nNow I was not merely a lover of horses, but I loved every horse I saw.\r\nI had never spent money except upon horses, and had never sold a horse.\r\nThe sight of this mighty one, terrible to look at, woke in me longing to\r\npossess him. It was pure greed, nay, rank covetousness, an evil thing\r\nin all the worlds. I do not mean that I could have stolen him, but that,\r\nregardless of his proper place, I would have bought him if I could. I\r\nlaid my hands on him, and stroked the protuberant bones that humped a\r\nhide smooth and thin, and shiny as satin--so shiny that the very shape\r\nof the moon was reflected in it; I fondled his sharp-pointed ears,\r\nwhispered words in them, and breathed into his red nostrils the breath\r\nof a man\'s life. He in return breathed into mine the breath of a horse\'s\r\nlife, and we loved one another. What eyes he had! Blue-filmy like the\r\neyes of the dead, behind each was a glowing coal! The raven, with wings\r\nhalf extended, looked on pleased at my love-making to his magnificent\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n"That is well! be friends with him," he said: "he will carry you all the\r\nbetter to-morrow!--Now we must hurry home!"\r\n\r\nMy desire to ride the horse had grown passionate.\r\n\r\n"May I not mount him at once, Mr. Raven?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"By all means!" he answered. "Mount, and ride him home."\r\n\r\nThe horse bent his head over my shoulder lovingly. I twisted my hands\r\nin his mane and scrambled onto his back, not without aid from certain\r\nprotuberant bones.\r\n\r\n"He would outspeed any leopard in creation!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Not that way at night," answered the raven; "the road is\r\ndifficult.--But come; loss now will be gain then! To wait is harder\r\nthan to run, and its meed is the fuller. Go on, my son--straight to\r\nthe cottage. I shall be there as soon as you. It will rejoice my wife\'s\r\nheart to see son of hers on that horse!"\r\n\r\nI sat silent. The horse stood like a block of marble.\r\n\r\n"Why do you linger?" asked the raven.\r\n\r\n"I long so much to ride after the leopardess," I answered, "that I can\r\nscarce restrain myself!"\r\n\r\n"You have promised!"\r\n\r\n"My debt to the Little Ones appears, I confess, a greater thing than my\r\nbond to you."\r\n\r\n"Yield to the temptation and you will bring mischief upon them--and on\r\nyourself also."\r\n\r\n"What matters it for me? I love them; and love works no evil. I will\r\ngo."\r\n\r\nBut the truth was, I forgot the children, infatuate with the horse.\r\n\r\nEyes flashed through the darkness, and I knew that Adam stood in his\r\nown shape beside me. I knew also by his voice that he repressed an\r\nindignation almost too strong for him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vane," he said, "do you not know why you have not yet done anything\r\nworth doing?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have been a fool," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Wherein?"\r\n\r\n"In everything."\r\n\r\n"Which do you count your most indiscreet action?"\r\n\r\n"Bringing the princess to life: I ought to have left her to her just\r\nfate."\r\n\r\n"Nay, now you talk foolishly! You could not have done otherwise than you\r\ndid, not knowing she was evil!--But you never brought any one to life!\r\nHow could you, yourself dead?"\r\n\r\n"I dead?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered; "and you will be dead, so long as you refuse to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Back to the old riddling!" I returned scornfully.\r\n\r\n"Be persuaded, and go home with me," he continued gently. "The\r\nmost--nearly the only foolish thing you ever did, was to run from our\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nI pressed the horse\'s ribs, and he was off like a sudden wind. I gave\r\nhim a pat on the side of the neck, and he went about in a sharp-driven\r\ncurve, "close to the ground, like a cat when scratchingly she wheels\r\nabout after a mouse," leaning sideways till his mane swept the tops of\r\nthe heather.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark I heard the wings of the raven. Five quick flaps I\r\nheard, and he perched on the horse\'s head. The horse checked himself\r\ninstantly, ploughing up the ground with his feet.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vane," croaked the raven, "think what you are doing! Twice already\r\nhas evil befallen you--once from fear, and once from heedlessness:\r\nbreach of word is far worse; it is a crime."\r\n\r\n"The Little Ones are in frightful peril, and I brought it upon them!" I\r\ncried. "--But indeed I will not break my word to you. I will return, and\r\nspend in your house what nights--what days--what years you please."\r\n\r\n"I tell you once more you will do them other than good if you go\r\nto-night," he insisted.\r\n\r\nBut a false sense of power, a sense which had no root and was merely\r\nvibrated into me from the strength of the horse, had, alas, rendered me\r\ntoo stupid to listen to anything he said!\r\n\r\n"Would you take from me my last chance of reparation?" I cried. "This\r\ntime there shall be no shirking! It is my duty, and I will go--if I\r\nperish for it!"\r\n\r\n"Go, then, foolish boy!" he returned, with anger in his croak. "Take the\r\nhorse, and ride to failure! May it be to humility!"\r\n\r\nHe spread his wings and flew. Again I pressed the lean ribs under me.\r\n\r\n"After the spotted leopardess!" I whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head this way and that, snuffing the air; then started,\r\nand went a few paces in a slow, undecided walk. Suddenly he quickened\r\nhis walk; broke into a trot; began to gallop, and in a few moments his\r\nspeed was tremendous. He seemed to see in the dark; never stumbled, not\r\nonce faltered, not once hesitated. I sat as on the ridge of a wave. I\r\nfelt under me the play of each individual muscle: his joints were so\r\nelastic, and his every movement glided so into the next, that not once\r\ndid he jar me. His growing swiftness bore him along until he flew rather\r\nthan ran. The wind met and passed us like a tornado.\r\n\r\nAcross the evil hollow we sped like a bolt from an arblast. No monster\r\nlifted its neck; all knew the hoofs that thundered over their heads! We\r\nrushed up the hills, we shot down their farther slopes; from the rocky\r\nchasms of the river-bed he did not swerve; he held on over them his\r\nfierce, terrible gallop. The moon, half-way up the heaven, gazed with\r\na solemn trouble in her pale countenance. Rejoicing in the power of my\r\nsteed and in the pride of my life, I sat like a king and rode.\r\n\r\nWe were near the middle of the many channels, my horse every other\r\nmoment clearing one, sometimes two in his stride, and now and then\r\ngathering himself for a great bounding leap, when the moon reached the\r\nkey-stone of her arch. Then came a wonder and a terror: she began to\r\ndescend rolling like the nave of Fortune\'s wheel bowled by the gods, and\r\nwent faster and faster. Like our own moon, this one had a human face,\r\nand now the broad forehead now the chin was uppermost as she rolled. I\r\ngazed aghast.\r\n\r\nAcross the ravines came the howling of wolves. An ugly fear began to\r\ninvade the hollow places of my heart; my confidence was on the wane! The\r\nhorse maintained his headlong swiftness, with ears pricked forward, and\r\nthirsty nostrils exulting in the wind his career created. But there was\r\nthe moon jolting like an old chariot-wheel down the hill of heaven, with\r\nawful boding! She rolled at last over the horizon-edge and disappeared,\r\ncarrying all her light with her.\r\n\r\nThe mighty steed was in the act of clearing a wide shallow channel when\r\nwe were caught in the net of the darkness. His head dropped; its impetus\r\ncarried his helpless bulk across, but he fell in a heap on the margin,\r\nand where he fell he lay. I got up, kneeled beside him, and felt him all\r\nover. Not a bone could I find broken, but he was a horse no more. I sat\r\ndown on the body, and buried my face in my hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. THE LOVERS AND THE BAGS\r\n\r\nBitterly cold grew the night. The body froze under me. The cry of the\r\nwolves came nearer; I heard their feet soft-padding on the rocky ground;\r\ntheir quick panting filled the air. Through the darkness I saw the many\r\nglowing eyes; their half-circle contracted around me. My time was come!\r\nI sprang to my feet.--Alas, I had not even a stick!\r\n\r\nThey came in a rush, their eyes flashing with fury of greed, their black\r\nthroats agape to devour me. I stood hopelessly waiting them. One moment\r\nthey halted over the horse--then came at me.\r\n\r\nWith a sound of swiftness all but silence, a cloud of green eyes came\r\ndown on their flank. The heads that bore them flew at the wolves with a\r\ncry feebler yet fiercer than their howling snarl, and by the cry I knew\r\nthem: they were cats, led by a huge gray one. I could see nothing of\r\nhim but his eyes, yet I knew him--and so knew his colour and bigness. A\r\nterrific battle followed, whose tale alone came to me through the night.\r\nI would have fled, for surely it was but a fight which should have\r\nme!--only where was the use? my first step would be a fall! and my foes\r\nof either kind could both see and scent me in the dark!\r\n\r\nAll at once I missed the howling, and the caterwauling grew wilder. Then\r\ncame the soft padding, and I knew it meant flight: the cats had defeated\r\nthe wolves! In a moment the sharpest of sharp teeth were in my legs;\r\na moment more and the cats were all over me in a live cataract,\r\nbiting wherever they could bite, furiously scratching me anywhere and\r\neverywhere. A multitude clung to my body; I could not flee. Madly I fell\r\non the hateful swarm, every finger instinct with destruction. I tore\r\nthem off me, I throttled at them in vain: when I would have flung them\r\nfrom me, they clung to my hands like limpets. I trampled them under my\r\nfeet, thrust my fingers in their eyes, caught them in jaws stronger\r\nthan theirs, but could not rid myself of one. Without cease they kept\r\ndiscovering upon me space for fresh mouthfuls; they hauled at my skin\r\nwith the widespread, horribly curved pincers of clutching claws; they\r\nhissed and spat in my face--but never touched it until, in my despair, I\r\nthrew myself on the ground, when they forsook my body, and darted at\r\nmy face. I rose, and immediately they left it, the more to occupy\r\nthemselves with my legs. In an agony I broke from them and ran, careless\r\nwhither, cleaving the solid dark. They accompanied me in a surrounding\r\ntorrent, now rubbing, now leaping up against me, but tormenting me no\r\nmore. When I fell, which was often, they gave me time to rise; when from\r\nfear of falling I slackened my pace, they flew afresh at my legs.\r\nAll that miserable night they kept me running--but they drove me by a\r\ncomparatively smooth path, for I tumbled into no gully, and passing the\r\nEvil Wood without seeing it, left it behind in the dark. When at length\r\nthe morning appeared, I was beyond the channels, and on the verge of the\r\norchard valley. In my joy I would have made friends with my persecutors,\r\nbut not a cat was to be seen. I threw myself on the moss, and fell fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI was waked by a kick, to find myself bound hand and foot, once more the\r\nthrall of the giants!\r\n\r\n"What fitter?" I said to myself; "to whom else should I belong?" and I\r\nlaughed in the triumph of self-disgust. A second kick stopped my false\r\nmerriment; and thus recurrently assisted by my captors, I succeeded at\r\nlength in rising to my feet.\r\n\r\nSix of them were about me. They undid the rope that tied my legs\r\ntogether, attached a rope to each of them, and dragged me away. I walked\r\nas well as I could, but, as they frequently pulled both ropes at once,\r\nI fell repeatedly, whereupon they always kicked me up again. Straight to\r\nmy old labour they took me, tied my leg-ropes to a tree, undid my arms,\r\nand put the hateful flint in my left hand. Then they lay down and pelted\r\nme with fallen fruit and stones, but seldom hit me. If I could have\r\nfreed my legs, and got hold of a stick I spied a couple of yards from\r\nme, I would have fallen upon all six of them! "But the Little Ones will\r\ncome at night!" I said to myself, and was comforted.\r\n\r\nAll day I worked hard. When the darkness came, they tied my hands, and\r\nleft me fast to the tree. I slept a good deal, but woke often, and every\r\ntime from a dream of lying in the heart of a heap of children. With the\r\nmorning my enemies reappeared, bringing their kicks and their bestial\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIt was about noon, and I was nearly failing from fatigue and hunger,\r\nwhen I heard a sudden commotion in the brushwood, followed by a burst of\r\nthe bell-like laughter so dear to my heart. I gave a loud cry of delight\r\nand welcome. Immediately rose a trumpeting as of baby-elephants, a\r\nneighing as of foals, and a bellowing as of calves, and through the\r\nbushes came a crowd of Little Ones, on diminutive horses, on small\r\nelephants, on little bears; but the noises came from the riders, not the\r\nanimals. Mingled with the mounted ones walked the bigger of the boys\r\nand girls, among the latter a woman with a baby crowing in her arms. The\r\ngiants sprang to their lumbering feet, but were instantly saluted with a\r\nstorm of sharp stones; the horses charged their legs; the bears rose and\r\nhugged them at the waist; the elephants threw their trunks round their\r\nnecks, pulled them down, and gave them such a trampling as they had\r\nsometimes given, but never received before. In a moment my ropes were\r\nundone, and I was in the arms, seemingly innumerable, of the Little\r\nOnes. For some time I saw no more of the giants.\r\n\r\nThey made me sit down, and my Lona came, and without a word began to\r\nfeed me with the loveliest red and yellow fruits. I sat and ate, the\r\nwhole colony mounting guard until I had done. Then they brought up two\r\nof the largest of their elephants, and having placed them side by side,\r\nhooked their trunks and tied their tails together. The docile creatures\r\ncould have untied their tails with a single shake, and unhooked their\r\ntrunks by forgetting them; but tails and trunks remained as their little\r\nmasters had arranged them, and it was clear the elephants understood\r\nthat they must keep their bodies parallel. I got up, and laid myself in\r\nthe hollow between their two backs; when the wise animals, counteracting\r\nthe weight that pushed them apart, leaned against each other, and made\r\nfor me a most comfortable litter. My feet, it is true, projected beyond\r\ntheir tails, but my head lay pillowed on an ear of each. Then some of\r\nthe smaller children, mounting for a bodyguard, ranged themselves in\r\na row along the back of each of my bearers; the whole assembly formed\r\nitself in train; and the procession began to move.\r\n\r\nWhither they were carrying me, I did not try to conjecture; I yielded\r\nmyself to their pleasure, almost as happy as they. Chattering and\r\nlaughing and playing glad tricks innumerable at first, the moment they\r\nsaw I was going to sleep, they became still as judges.\r\n\r\nI woke: a sudden musical uproar greeted the opening of my eyes.\r\n\r\nWe were travelling through the forest in which they found the babies,\r\nand which, as I had suspected, stretched all the way from the valley to\r\nthe hot stream.\r\n\r\nA tiny girl sat with her little feet close to my face, and looked down\r\nat me coaxingly for a while, then spoke, the rest seeming to hang on her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"We make a petisson to king," she said.\r\n\r\n"What is it, my darling?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Shut eyes one minute," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will! Here goes!" I replied, and shut my eyes close.\r\n\r\n"No, no! not fore I tell oo!" she cried.\r\n\r\nI opened them again, and we talked and laughed together for quite\r\nanother hour.\r\n\r\n"Close eyes!" she said suddenly.\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes, and kept them close. The elephants stood still. I\r\nheard a soft scurry, a little rustle, and then a silence--for in that\r\nworld SOME silences ARE heard.\r\n\r\n"Open eyes!" twenty voices a little way off shouted at once; but when I\r\nobeyed, not a creature was visible except the elephants that bore me.\r\nI knew the children marvellously quick in getting out of the way--the\r\ngiants had taught them that; but when I raised myself, and looking about\r\nin the open shrubless forest, could descry neither hand nor heel, I\r\nstared in "blank astonishment."\r\n\r\nThe sun was set, and it was fast getting dark, yet presently a multitude\r\nof birds began to sing. I lay down to listen, pretty sure that, if I\r\nleft them alone, the hiders would soon come out again.\r\n\r\nThe singing grew to a little storm of bird-voices. "Surely the children\r\nmust have something to do with it!--And yet how could they set the\r\nbirds singing?" I said to myself as I lay and listened. Soon, however,\r\nhappening to look up into the tree under which my elephants stood,\r\nI thought I spied a little motion among the leaves, and looked more\r\nkeenly. Sudden white spots appeared in the dark foliage, the music died\r\ndown, a gale of childish laughter rippled the air, and white spots came\r\nout in every direction: the trees were full of children! In the wildest\r\nmerriment they began to descend, some dropping from bough to bough\r\nso rapidly that I could scarce believe they had not fallen. I left my\r\nlitter, and was instantly surrounded--a mark for all the artillery of\r\ntheir jubilant fun. With stately composure the elephants walked away to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"But," said I, when their uproarious gladness had had scope for a while,\r\n"how is it that I never before heard you sing like the birds? Even when\r\nI thought it must be you, I could hardly believe it!"\r\n\r\n"Ah," said one of the wildest, "but we were not birds then! We were\r\nrun-creatures, not fly-creatures! We had our hide-places in the bushes\r\nthen; but when we came to no-bushes, only trees, we had to build nests!\r\nWhen we built nests, we grew birds, and when we were birds, we had to do\r\nbirds! We asked them to teach us their noises, and they taught us, and\r\nnow we are real birds!--Come and see my nest. It\'s not big enough for\r\nking, but it\'s big enough for king to see me in it!"\r\n\r\nI told him I could not get up a tree without the sun to show me the way;\r\nwhen he came, I would try.\r\n\r\n"Kings seldom have wings!" I added.\r\n\r\n"King! king!" cried one, "oo knows none of us hasn\'t no wings--foolis\r\nfeddery tings! Arms and legs is better."\r\n\r\n"That is true. I can get up without wings--and carry straws in my mouth\r\ntoo, to build my nest with!"\r\n\r\n"Oo knows!" he answered, and went away sucking his thumb.\r\n\r\nA moment after, I heard him calling out of his nest, a great way up a\r\nwalnut tree of enormous size,\r\n\r\n"Up adain, king! Dood night! I seepy!"\r\n\r\nAnd I heard no more of him till he woke me in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. LONA\'S NARRATIVE\r\n\r\nI lay down by a tree, and one and one or in little groups, the children\r\nleft me and climbed to their nests. They were always so tired at night\r\nand so rested in the morning, that they were equally glad to go to sleep\r\nand to get up again. I, although tired also, lay awake: Lona had not bid\r\nme good night, and I was sure she would come.\r\n\r\nI had been struck, the moment I saw her again, with her resemblance to\r\nthe princess, and could not doubt her the daughter of whom Adam had\r\ntold me; but in Lona the dazzling beauty of Lilith was softened by\r\nchildlikeness, and deepened by the sense of motherhood. "She is\r\noccupied probably," I said to myself, "with the child of the woman I met\r\nfleeing!" who, she had already told me, was not half mother enough.\r\n\r\nShe came at length, sat down beside me, and after a few moments of\r\nsilent delight, expressed mainly by stroking my face and hands, began to\r\ntell me everything that had befallen since I went. The moon appeared as\r\nwe talked, and now and then, through the leaves, lighted for a quivering\r\nmoment her beautiful face--full of thought, and a care whose love\r\nredeemed and glorified it. How such a child should have been born of\r\nsuch a mother--such a woman of such a princess, was hard to understand;\r\nbut then, happily, she had two parents--say rather, three! She drew my\r\nheart by what in me was likest herself, and I loved her as one who, grow\r\nto what perfection she might, could only become the more a child. I knew\r\nnow that I loved her when I left her, and that the hope of seeing\r\nher again had been my main comfort. Every word she spoke seemed to go\r\nstraight to my heart, and, like the truth itself, make it purer.\r\n\r\nShe told me that after I left the orchard valley, the giants began to\r\nbelieve a little more in the actual existence of their neighbours, and\r\nbecame in consequence more hostile to them. Sometimes the Little\r\nOnes would see them trampling furiously, perceiving or imagining some\r\nindication of their presence, while they indeed stood beside, and\r\nlaughed at their foolish rage. By and by, however, their animosity\r\nassumed a more practical shape: they began to destroy the trees on\r\nwhose fruit the Little Ones lived. This drove the mother of them all to\r\nmeditate counteraction. Setting the sharpest of them to listen at\r\nnight, she learned that the giants thought I was hidden somewhere near,\r\nintending, as soon as I recovered my strength, to come in the dark and\r\nkill them sleeping. Thereupon she concluded that the only way to stop\r\nthe destruction was to give them ground for believing that they had\r\nabandoned the place. The Little Ones must remove into the forest--beyond\r\nthe range of the giants, but within reach of their own trees, which they\r\nmust visit by night! The main objection to the plan was, that the forest\r\nhad little or no undergrowth to shelter--or conceal them if necessary.\r\n\r\nBut she reflected that where birds, there the Little Ones could find\r\nhabitation. They had eager sympathies with all modes of life, and could\r\nlearn of the wildest creatures: why should they not take refuge from the\r\ncold and their enemies in the tree-tops? why not, having lain in the\r\nlow brushwood, seek now the lofty foliage? why not build nests where\r\nit would not serve to scoop hollows? All that the birds could do, the\r\nLittle Ones could learn--except, indeed, to fly!\r\n\r\nShe spoke to them on the subject, and they heard with approval. They\r\ncould already climb the trees, and they had often watched the birds\r\nbuilding their nests! The trees of the forest, although large, did not\r\nlook bad! They went up much nearer the sky than those of the giants,\r\nand spread out their arms--some even stretched them down--as if inviting\r\nthem to come and live with them! Perhaps, in the top of the tallest,\r\nthey might find that bird that laid the baby-eggs, and sat upon them\r\ntill they were ripe, then tumbled them down to let the little ones out!\r\nYes; they would build sleep-houses in the trees, where no giant would\r\nsee them, for never by any chance did one throw back his dull head to\r\nlook up! Then the bad giants would be sure they had left the country,\r\nand the Little Ones would gather their own apples and pears and figs and\r\nmesples and peaches when they were asleep!\r\n\r\nThus reasoned the Lovers, and eagerly adopted Lona\'s suggestion--with\r\nthe result that they were soon as much at home in the tree-tops as the\r\nbirds themselves, and that the giants came ere long to the conclusion\r\nthat they had frightened them out of the country--whereupon they forgot\r\ntheir trees, and again almost ceased to believe in the existence of\r\ntheir small neighbours.\r\n\r\nLona asked me whether I had not observed that many of the children were\r\ngrown. I answered I had not, but could readily believe it. She assured\r\nme it was so, but said the certain evidence that their minds too had\r\ngrown since their migration upward, had gone far in mitigation of the\r\nalarm the discovery had occasioned her.\r\n\r\nIn the last of the short twilight, and later when the moon was shining,\r\nthey went down to the valley, and gathered fruit enough to serve them\r\nthe next day; for the giants never went out in the twilight: that to\r\nthem was darkness; and they hated the moon: had they been able, they\r\nwould have extinguished her. But soon the Little Ones found that fruit\r\ngathered in the night was not altogether good the next day; so the\r\nquestion arose whether it would not be better, instead of pretending to\r\nhave left the country, to make the bad giants themselves leave it.\r\n\r\nThey had already, she said, in exploring the forest, made acquaintance\r\nwith the animals in it, and with most of them personally. Knowing\r\ntherefore how strong as well as wise and docile some of them were, and\r\nhow swift as well as manageable many others, they now set themselves\r\nto secure their aid against the giants, and with loving, playful\r\napproaches, had soon made more than friends of most of them, from\r\nthe first addressing horse or elephant as Brother or Sister Elephant,\r\nBrother or Sister Horse, until before long they had an individual name\r\nfor each. It was some little time longer before they said Brother or\r\nSister Bear, but that came next, and the other day she had heard one\r\nlittle fellow cry, "Ah, Sister Serpent!" to a snake that bit him as he\r\nplayed with it too roughly. Most of them would have nothing to do with a\r\ncaterpillar, except watch it through its changes; but when at length it\r\ncame from its retirement with wings, all would immediately address it as\r\nSister Butterfly, congratulating it on its metamorphosis--for which\r\nthey used a word that meant something like REPENTANCE--and evidently\r\nregarding it as something sacred.\r\n\r\nOne moonlit evening, as they were going to gather their fruit, they came\r\nupon a woman seated on the ground with a baby in her lap--the woman\r\nI had met on my way to Bulika. They took her for a giantess that had\r\nstolen one of their babies, for they regarded all babies as their\r\nproperty. Filled with anger they fell upon her multitudinously, beating\r\nher after a childish, yet sufficiently bewildering fashion. She would\r\nhave fled, but a boy threw himself down and held her by the feet.\r\nRecovering her wits, she recognised in her assailants the children whose\r\nhospitality she sought, and at once yielded the baby. Lona appeared, and\r\ncarried it away in her bosom.\r\n\r\nBut while the woman noted that in striking her they were careful not to\r\nhurt the child, the Little Ones noted that, as she surrendered her,\r\nshe hugged and kissed her just as they wanted to do, and came to the\r\nconclusion that she must be a giantess of the same kind as the good\r\ngiant. The moment Lona had the baby, therefore, they brought the mother\r\nfruit, and began to show her every sort of childish attention.\r\n\r\nNow the woman had been in perplexity whither to betake herself, not\r\ndaring to go back to the city, because the princess was certain to find\r\nout who had lamed her leopardess: delighted with the friendliness of\r\nthe little people, she resolved to remain with them for the present:\r\nshe would have no trouble with her infant, and might find some way\r\nof returning to her husband, who was rich in money and gems, and very\r\nseldom unkind to her.\r\n\r\nHere I must supplement, partly from conjecture, what Lona told me about\r\nthe woman. With the rest of the inhabitants of Bulika, she was aware\r\nof the tradition that the princess lived in terror of the birth of an\r\ninfant destined to her destruction. They were all unacquainted, however,\r\nwith the frightful means by which she preserved her youth and beauty;\r\nand her deteriorating physical condition requiring a larger use of those\r\nmeans, they took the apparent increase of her hostility to children for\r\na sign that she saw her doom approaching. This, although no one dreamed\r\nof any attempt against her, nourished in them hopes of change.\r\n\r\nNow arose in the mind of the woman the idea of furthering the fulfilment\r\nof the shadowy prediction, or of using the myth at least for her own\r\nrestoration to her husband. For what seemed more probable than that\r\nthe fate foretold lay with these very children? They were marvellously\r\nbrave, and the Bulikans cowards, in abject terror of animals! If she\r\ncould rouse in the Little Ones the ambition of taking the city, then\r\nin the confusion of the attack, she would escape from the little army,\r\nreach her house unrecognised, and there lying hidden, await the result!\r\n\r\nShould the children now succeed in expelling the giants, she would\r\nbegin at once, while they were yet flushed with victory, to suggest the\r\nloftier aim! By disposition, indeed, they were unfit for warfare; they\r\nhardly ever quarrelled, and never fought; loved every live thing, and\r\nhated either to hurt or to suffer. Still, they were easily influenced,\r\nand could certainly be taught any exercise within their strength!--At\r\nonce she set some of the smaller ones throwing stones at a mark; and\r\nsoon they were all engrossed with the new game, and growing skilful in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe first practical result was their use of stones in my rescue. While\r\ngathering fruit, they found me asleep, went home, held a council, came\r\nthe next day with their elephants and horses, overwhelmed the few\r\ngiants watching me, and carried me off. Jubilant over their victory,\r\nthe smaller boys were childishly boastful, the bigger boys less\r\nostentatious, while the girls, although their eyes flashed more, were\r\nnot so talkative as usual. The woman of Bulika no doubt felt encouraged.\r\n\r\nWe talked the greater part of the night, chiefly about the growth of the\r\nchildren, and what it might indicate. With Lona\'s power of recognising\r\ntruth I had long been familiar; now I began to be astonished at her\r\npractical wisdom. Probably, had I been more of a child myself, I should\r\nhave wondered less.\r\n\r\nIt was yet far from morning when I became aware of a slight fluttering\r\nand scrambling. I rose on my elbow, and looking about me, saw many\r\nLittle Ones descend from their nests. They disappeared, and in a few\r\nmoments all was again still.\r\n\r\n"What are they doing?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"They think," answered Lona, "that, stupid as they are, the giants\r\nwill search the wood, and they are gone to gather stones with which to\r\nreceive them. Stones are not plentiful in the forest, and they have to\r\nscatter far to find enow. They will carry them to their nests, and from\r\nthe trees attack the giants as they come within reach. Knowing their\r\nhabits, they do not expect them before the morning. If they do come, it\r\nwill be the opening of a war of expulsion: one or the other people must\r\ngo. The result, however, is hardly doubtful. We do not mean to\r\nkill them; indeed, their skulls are so thick that I do not think we\r\ncould!--not that killing would do them much harm; they are so little\r\nalive! If one were killed, his giantess would not remember him beyond\r\nthree days!"\r\n\r\n"Do the children then throw so well that the thing MIGHT happen?" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Wait till you see them!" she answered, with a touch of pride. "--But I\r\nhave not yet told you," she went on, "of a strange thing that happened\r\nthe night before last!--We had come home from gathering our fruit, and\r\nwere asleep in our nests, when we were roused by the horrid noises\r\nof beasts fighting. The moon was bright, and in a moment our trees\r\nglittered with staring little eyes, watching two huge leopardesses, one\r\nperfectly white, the other covered with black spots, which worried and\r\ntore each other with I do not know how many teeth and claws. To judge by\r\nher back, the spotted creature must have been climbing a tree when the\r\nother sprang upon her. When first I saw them, they were just under my\r\nown tree, rolling over and over each other. I got down on the lowest\r\nbranch, and saw them perfectly. The children enjoyed the spectacle,\r\nsiding some with this one, some with that, for we had never seen such\r\nbeasts before, and thought they were only at play. But by degrees their\r\nroaring and growling almost ceased, and I saw that they were in deadly\r\nearnest, and heartily wished neither might be left able to climb a\r\ntree. But when the children saw the blood pouring from their flanks and\r\nthroats, what do you think they did? They scurried down to comfort them,\r\nand gathering in a great crowd about the terrible creatures, began to\r\npat and stroke them. Then I got down as well, for they were much too\r\nabsorbed to heed my calling to them; but before I could reach them, the\r\nwhite one stopped fighting, and sprang among them with such a hideous\r\nyell that they flew up into the trees like birds. Before I got back into\r\nmine, the wicked beasts were at it again tooth and claw. Then Whitey\r\nhad the best of it; Spotty ran away as fast as she could run, and Whitey\r\ncame and lay down at the foot of my tree. But in a minute or two she was\r\nup again, and walking about as if she thought Spotty might be lurking\r\nsomewhere. I waked often, and every time I looked out, I saw her. In the\r\nmorning she went away."\r\n\r\n"I know both the beasts," I said. "Spotty is a bad beast. She hates the\r\nchildren, and would kill every one of them. But Whitey loves them. She\r\nran at them only to frighten them away, lest Spotty should get hold of\r\nany of them. No one needs be afraid of Whitey!"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Little Ones were coming back, and with much noise, for\r\nthey had no care to keep quiet now that they were at open war with the\r\ngiants, and laden with good stones. They mounted to their nests again,\r\nthough with difficulty because of their burdens, and in a minute were\r\nfast asleep. Lona retired to her tree. I lay where I was, and slept\r\nthe better that I thought most likely the white leopardess was still\r\nsomewhere in the wood.\r\n\r\nI woke soon after the sun, and lay pondering. Two hours passed, and then\r\nin truth the giants began to appear, in straggling companies of three\r\nand four, until I counted over a hundred of them. The children were\r\nstill asleep, and to call them would draw the attention of the giants: I\r\nwould keep quiet so long as they did not discover me. But by and by one\r\ncame blundering upon me, stumbled, fell, and rose again. I thought he\r\nwould pass heedless, but he began to search about. I sprang to my feet,\r\nand struck him in the middle of his huge body. The roar he gave roused\r\nthe children, and a storm as of hail instantly came on, of which not a\r\nstone struck me, and not one missed the giant. He fell and lay. Others\r\ndrew near, and the storm extended, each purblind creature becoming,\r\nas he entered the range of a garrisoned tree, a target for converging\r\nstones. In a short time almost every giant was prostrate, and a jubilant\r\npaean of bird-song rose from the tops of fifty trees.\r\n\r\nMany elephants came hurrying up, and the children descending the trees\r\nlike monkeys, in a moment every elephant had three or four of them on\r\nhis back, and thus loaded, began to walk over the giants, who lay and\r\nroared. Losing patience at length with their noise, the elephants gave\r\nthem a few blows of their trunks, and left them.\r\n\r\nUntil night the bad giants remained where they had fallen, silent and\r\nmotionless. The next morning they had disappeared every one, and the\r\nchildren saw no more of them. They removed to the other end of the\r\norchard valley, and never after ventured into the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. PREPARATION\r\n\r\nVictory thus gained, the woman of Bulika began to speak about the city,\r\nand talked much of its defenceless condition, of the wickedness of\r\nits princess, of the cowardice of its inhabitants. In a few days the\r\nchildren chattered of nothing but Bulika, although indeed they had not\r\nthe least notion of what a city was. Then first I became aware of the\r\ndesign of the woman, although not yet of its motive.\r\n\r\nThe idea of taking possession of the place, recommended itself greatly\r\nto Lona--and to me also. The children were now so rapidly developing\r\nfaculty, that I could see no serious obstacle to the success of the\r\nenterprise. For the terrible Lilith--woman or leopardess, I knew her one\r\nvulnerable point, her doom through her daughter, and the influence\r\nthe ancient prophecy had upon the citizens: surely whatever in the\r\nenterprise could be called risk, was worth taking! Successful,--and who\r\ncould doubt their success?--must not the Little Ones, from a crowd\r\nof children, speedily become a youthful people, whose government and\r\ninfluence would be all for righteousness? Ruling the wicked with a rod\r\nof iron, would they not be the redemption of the nation?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I have to confess that I was not without views of\r\npersonal advantage, not without ambition in the undertaking. It was\r\njust, it seemed to me, that Lona should take her seat on the throne\r\nthat had been her mother\'s, and natural that she should make of me her\r\nconsort and minister. For me, I would spend my life in her service; and\r\nbetween us, what might we not do, with such a core to it as the Little\r\nOnes, for the development of a noble state?\r\n\r\nI confess also to an altogether foolish dream of opening a commerce in\r\ngems between the two worlds--happily impossible, for it could have done\r\nnothing but harm to both.\r\n\r\nCalling to mind the appeal of Adam, I suggested to Lona that to find\r\nthem water might perhaps expedite the growth of the Little Ones. She\r\njudged it prudent, however, to leave that alone for the present, as we\r\ndid not know what its first consequences might be; while, in the course\r\nof time, it would almost certainly subject them to a new necessity.\r\n\r\n"They are what they are without it!" she said: "when we have the city,\r\nwe will search for water!"\r\n\r\nWe began, therefore, and pushed forward our preparations, constantly\r\nreviewing the merry troops and companies. Lona gave her attention\r\nchiefly to the commissariat, while I drilled the little soldiers,\r\nexercised them in stone-throwing, taught them the use of some other\r\nweapons, and did all I could to make warriors of them. The main\r\ndifficulty was to get them to rally to their flag the instant the call\r\nwas sounded. Most of them were armed with slings, some of the bigger\r\nboys with bows and arrows. The bigger girls carried aloe-spikes,\r\nstrong as steel and sharp as needles, fitted to longish shafts--rather\r\nformidable weapons. Their sole duty was the charge of such as were too\r\nsmall to fight.\r\n\r\nLona had herself grown a good deal, but did not seem aware of it:\r\nshe had always been, as she still was, the tallest! Her hair was\r\nmuch longer, and she was become almost a woman, but not one beauty of\r\nchildhood had she outgrown. When first we met after our long separation,\r\nshe laid down her infant, put her arms round my neck, and clung to me\r\nsilent, her face glowing with gladness: the child whimpered; she\r\nsprang to him, and had him in her bosom instantly. To see her with\r\nany thoughtless, obstinate, or irritable little one, was to think of\r\na tender grandmother. I seemed to have known her for ages--for\r\nalways--from before time began! I hardly remembered my mother, but in my\r\nmind\'s eye she now looked like Lona; and if I imagined sister or child,\r\ninvariably she had the face of Lona! My every imagination flew to her;\r\nshe was my heart\'s wife! She hardly ever sought me, but was almost\r\nalways within sound of my voice. What I did or thought, I referred\r\nconstantly to her, and rejoiced to believe that, while doing her work in\r\nabsolute independence, she was most at home by my side. Never for me did\r\nshe neglect the smallest child, and my love only quickened my sense\r\nof duty. To love her and to do my duty, seemed, not indeed one, but\r\ninseparable. She might suggest something I should do; she might ask me\r\nwhat she ought to do; but she never seemed to suppose that I, any more\r\nthan she, would like to do, or could care about anything except what\r\nmust be done. Her love overflowed upon me--not in caresses, but in a\r\ncloseness of recognition which I can compare to nothing but the devotion\r\nof a divine animal.\r\n\r\nI never told her anything about her mother.\r\n\r\nThe wood was full of birds, the splendour of whose plumage, while it\r\ntook nothing from their song, seemed almost to make up for the lack of\r\nflowers--which, apparently, could not grow without water. Their glorious\r\nfeathers being everywhere about in the forest, it came into my heart to\r\nmake from them a garment for Lona. While I gathered, and bound them in\r\noverlapping rows, she watched me with evident appreciation of my choice\r\nand arrangement, never asking what I was fashioning, but evidently\r\nwaiting expectant the result of my work. In a week or two it was\r\nfinished--a long loose mantle, to fasten at the throat and waist, with\r\nopenings for the arms.\r\n\r\nI rose and put it on her. She rose, took it off, and laid it at my\r\nfeet--I imagine from a sense of propriety. I put it again on her\r\nshoulders, and showed her where to put her arms through. She smiled,\r\nlooked at the feathers a little and stroked them--again took it off and\r\nlaid it down, this time by her side. When she left me, she carried it\r\nwith her, and I saw no more of it for some days. At length she came to\r\nme one morning wearing it, and carrying another garment which she had\r\nfashioned similarly, but of the dried leaves of a tough evergreen. It\r\nhad the strength almost of leather, and the appearance of scale-armour.\r\nI put it on at once, and we always thereafter wore those garments when\r\non horseback.\r\n\r\nFor, on the outskirts of the forest, had appeared one day a troop of\r\nfull-grown horses, with which, as they were nowise alarmed at creatures\r\nof a shape so different from their own, I had soon made friends, and two\r\nof the finest I had trained for Lona and myself. Already accustomed to\r\nride a small one, her delight was great when first she looked down from\r\nthe back of an animal of the giant kind; and the horse showed himself\r\nproud of the burden he bore. We exercised them every day until they had\r\nsuch confidence in us as to obey instantly and fear nothing; after which\r\nwe always rode them at parade and on the march.\r\n\r\nThe undertaking did indeed at times appear to me a foolhardy one,\r\nbut the confidence of the woman of Bulika, real or simulated, always\r\novercame my hesitancy. The princess\'s magic, she insisted, would prove\r\npowerless against the children; and as to any force she might muster,\r\nour animal-allies alone would assure our superiority: she was herself,\r\nshe said, ready, with a good stick, to encounter any two men of Bulika.\r\nShe confessed to not a little fear of the leopardess, but I was myself\r\nready for her. I shrank, however, from carrying ALL the children with\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"Would it not be better," I said, "that you remained in the forest with\r\nyour baby and the smallest of the Little Ones?"\r\n\r\nShe answered that she greatly relied on the impression the sight of them\r\nwould make on the women, especially the mothers.\r\n\r\n"When they see the darlings," she said, "their hearts will be taken by\r\nstorm; and I must be there encouraging them to make a stand! If there be\r\na remnant of hardihood in the place, it will be found among the women!"\r\n\r\n"YOU must not encumber yourself," I said to Lona, "with any of the\r\nchildren; you will be wanted everywhere!"\r\n\r\nFor there were two babies besides the woman\'s, and even on horseback she\r\nhad almost always one in her arms.\r\n\r\n"I do not remember ever being without a child to take care of," she\r\nanswered; "but when we reach the city, it shall be as you wish!"\r\n\r\nHer confidence in one who had failed so unworthily, shamed me. But\r\nneither had I initiated the movement, nor had I any ground for opposing\r\nit; I had no choice, but must give it the best help I could! For myself,\r\nI was ready to live or die with Lona. Her humility as well as her trust\r\nhumbled me, and I gave myself heartily to her purposes.\r\n\r\nOur way lying across a grassy plain, there was no need to take food for\r\nthe horses, or the two cows which would accompany us for the infants;\r\nbut the elephants had to be provided for. True, the grass was as good\r\nfor them as for those other animals, but it was short, and with their\r\none-fingered long noses, they could not pick enough for a single meal.\r\nWe had, therefore, set the whole colony to gather grass and make hay, of\r\nwhich the elephants themselves could carry a quantity sufficient to last\r\nthem several days, with the supplement of what we would gather fresh\r\nevery time we halted. For the bears we stored nuts, and for ourselves\r\ndried plenty of fruits. We had caught and tamed several more of the\r\nbig horses, and now having loaded them and the elephants with these\r\nprovisions, we were prepared to set out.\r\n\r\nThen Lona and I held a general review, and I made them a little speech.\r\nI began by telling them that I had learned a good deal about them, and\r\nknew now where they came from. "We did not come from anywhere," they\r\ncried, interrupting me; "we are here!"\r\n\r\nI told them that every one of them had a mother of his own, like the\r\nmother of the last baby; that I believed they had all been brought from\r\nBulika when they were so small that they could not now remember it; that\r\nthe wicked princess there was so afraid of babies, and so determined to\r\ndestroy them, that their mothers had to carry them away and leave them\r\nwhere she could not find them; and that now we were going to Bulika, to\r\nfind their mothers, and deliver them from the bad giantess.\r\n\r\n"But I must tell you," I continued, "that there is danger before us,\r\nfor, as you know, we may have to fight hard to take the city."\r\n\r\n"We can fight! we are ready!" cried the boys.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can," I returned, "and I know you will: mothers are worth\r\nfighting for! Only mind, you must all keep together."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; we\'ll take care of each other," they answered. "Nobody shall\r\ntouch one of us but his own mother!"\r\n\r\n"You must mind, every one, to do immediately what your officers tell\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"We will, we will!--Now we\'re quite ready! Let us go!"\r\n\r\n"Another thing you must not forget," I went on: "when you strike, be\r\nsure you make it a downright swinging blow; when you shoot an arrow,\r\ndraw it to the head; when you sling a stone, sling it strong and\r\nstraight."\r\n\r\n"That we will!" they cried with jubilant, fearless shout.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will be hurt!"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t mind that!--Do we, boys?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit!"\r\n\r\n"Some of you may very possibly be killed!" I said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind being killed!" cried one of the finest of the smaller\r\nboys: he rode a beautiful little bull, which galloped and jumped like a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t either! I don\'t either!" came from all sides.\r\n\r\nThen Lona, queen and mother and sister of them all, spoke from her big\r\nhorse by my side:\r\n\r\n"I would give my life," she said, "to have my mother! She might kill me\r\nif she liked! I should just kiss her and die!"\r\n\r\n"Come along, boys!" cried a girl. "We\'re going to our mothers!"\r\n\r\nA pang went through my heart.--But I could not draw back; it would be\r\nmoral ruin to the Little Ones!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV. THE LITTLE ONES IN BULIKA\r\n\r\nIt was early in the morning when we set out, making, between the blue\r\nsky and the green grass, a gallant show on the wide plain. We would\r\ntravel all the morning, and rest the afternoon; then go on at night,\r\nrest the next day, and start again in the short twilight. The latter\r\npart of our journey we would endeavour so to divide as to arrive at the\r\ncity with the first of the morning, and be already inside the gates when\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if all the inhabitants of the forest would migrate with us.\r\nA multitude of birds flew in front, imagining themselves, no doubt,\r\nthe leading division; great companies of butterflies and other insects\r\nplayed about our heads; and a crowd of four-footed creatures followed\r\nus. These last, when night came, left us almost all; but the birds and\r\nthe butterflies, the wasps and the dragon-flies, went with us to the\r\nvery gates of the city.\r\n\r\nWe halted and slept soundly through the afternoon: it was our first real\r\nmarch, but none were tired. In the night we went faster, because it was\r\ncold. Many fell asleep on the backs of their beasts, and woke in the\r\nmorning quite fresh. None tumbled off. Some rode shaggy, shambling\r\nbears, which yet made speed enough, going as fast as the elephants.\r\nOthers were mounted on different kinds of deer, and would have been\r\nracing all the way had I not prevented it. Those atop of the hay on the\r\nelephants, unable to see the animals below them, would keep talking to\r\nthem as long as they were awake. Once, when we had halted to feed, I\r\nheard a little fellow, as he drew out the hay to give him, commune thus\r\nwith his "darling beast":\r\n\r\n"Nosy dear, I am digging you out of the mountain, and shall soon get\r\ndown to you: be patient; I\'m a coming! Very soon now you\'ll send up your\r\nnose to look for me, and then we\'ll kiss like good elephants, we will!"\r\n\r\nThe same night there burst out such a tumult of elephant-trumpeting,\r\nhorse-neighing, and child-imitation, ringing far over the silent levels,\r\nthat, uncertain how near the city might not be, I quickly stilled the\r\nuproar lest it should give warning of our approach.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, one morning, the sun and the city rose, as it seemed,\r\ntogether. To the children the walls appeared only a great mass of\r\nrock, but when I told them the inside was full of nests of stone, I saw\r\napprehension and dislike at once invade their hearts: for the first time\r\nin their lives, I believe--many of them long little lives--they knew\r\nfear. The place looked to them bad: how were they to find mothers in\r\nsuch a place? But they went on bravely, for they had confidence in\r\nLona--and in me too, little as I deserved it.\r\n\r\nWe rode through the sounding archway. Sure never had such a drumming of\r\nhoofs, such a padding of paws and feet been heard on its old pavement!\r\nThe horses started and looked scared at the echo of their own steps;\r\nsome halted a moment, some plunged wildly and wheeled about; but they\r\nwere soon quieted, and went on. Some of the Little Ones shivered, and\r\nall were still as death. The three girls held closer the infants they\r\ncarried. All except the bears and butterflies manifested fear.\r\n\r\nOn the countenance of the woman lay a dark anxiety; nor was I myself\r\nunaffected by the general dread, for the whole army was on my hands and\r\non my conscience: I had brought it up to the danger whose shadow was\r\nnow making itself felt! But I was supported by the thought of the coming\r\nkingdom of the Little Ones, with the bad giants its slaves, and the\r\nanimals its loving, obedient friends! Alas, I who dreamed thus, had not\r\nmyself learned to obey! Untrusting, unfaithful obstinacy had set me at\r\nthe head of that army of innocents! I was myself but a slave, like any\r\nking in the world I had left who does or would do only what pleases him!\r\nBut Lona rode beside me a child indeed, therefore a free woman--calm,\r\nsilent, watchful, not a whit afraid!\r\n\r\nWe were nearly in the heart of the city before any of its inhabitants\r\nbecame aware of our presence. But now windows began to open, and sleepy\r\nheads to look out. Every face wore at first a dull stare of wonderless\r\nastonishment, which, as soon as the starers perceived the animals,\r\nchanged to one of consternation. In spite of their fear, however, when\r\nthey saw that their invaders were almost all children, the women came\r\nrunning into the streets, and the men followed. But for a time all of\r\nthem kept close to the houses, leaving open the middle of the way, for\r\nthey durst not approach the animals.\r\n\r\nAt length a boy, who looked about five years old, and was full of the\r\nidea of his mother, spying in the crowd a woman whose face attracted\r\nhim, threw himself upon her from his antelope, and clung about her neck;\r\nnor was she slow to return his embrace and kisses. But the hand of a man\r\ncame over her shoulder, and seized him by the neck. Instantly a girl ran\r\nher sharp spear into the fellow\'s arm. He sent forth a savage howl, and\r\nimmediately stabbed by two or three more, fled yelling.\r\n\r\n"They are just bad giants!" said Lona, her eyes flashing as she drove\r\nher horse against one of unusual height who, having stirred up the\r\nlittle manhood in him, stood barring her way with a club. He dared not\r\nabide the shock, but slunk aside, and the next moment went down, struck\r\nby several stones. Another huge fellow, avoiding my charger, stepped\r\nsuddenly, with a speech whose rudeness alone was intelligible, between\r\nme and the boy who rode behind me. The boy told him to address the king;\r\nthe giant struck his little horse on the head with a hammer, and he\r\nfell. Before the brute could strike again, however, one of the elephants\r\nbehind laid him prostrate, and trampled on him so that he did not\r\nattempt to get up until hundreds of feet had walked over him, and the\r\narmy was gone by.\r\n\r\nBut at sight of the women what a dismay clouded the face of Lona! Hardly\r\none of them was even pleasant to look upon! Were her darlings to find\r\nmothers among such as these?\r\n\r\nHardly had we halted in the central square, when two girls rode up in\r\nanxious haste, with the tidings that two of the boys had been hurried\r\naway by some women. We turned at once, and then first discovered that\r\nthe woman we befriended had disappeared with her baby.\r\n\r\nBut at the same moment we descried a white leopardess come bounding\r\ntoward us down a narrow lane that led from the square to the palace. The\r\nLittle Ones had not forgotten the fight of the two leopardesses in the\r\nforest: some of them looked terrified, and their ranks began to waver;\r\nbut they remembered the order I had just given them, and stood fast.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to see the result; when suddenly a small boy, called Odu,\r\nremarkable for his speed and courage, who had heard me speak of the\r\ngoodness of the white leopardess, leaped from the back of his bear,\r\nwhich went shambling after him, and ran to meet her. The leopardess,\r\nto avoid knocking him down, pulled herself up so suddenly that she went\r\nrolling over and over: when she recovered her feet she found the child\r\non her back. Who could doubt the subjugation of a people which saw an\r\nurchin of the enemy bestride an animal of which they lived in daily\r\nterror? Confident of the effect on the whole army, we rode on.\r\n\r\nAs we stopped at the house to which our guides led us, we heard a\r\nscream; I sprang down, and thundered at the door. My horse came and\r\npushed me away with his nose, turned about, and had begun to batter the\r\ndoor with his heels, when up came little Odu on the leopardess, and at\r\nsight of her he stood still, trembling. But she too had heard the cry,\r\nand forgetting the child on her back, threw herself at the door; the\r\nboy was dashed against it, and fell senseless. Before I could reach him,\r\nLona had him in her arms, and as soon as he came to himself, set him on\r\nthe back of his bear, which had still followed him.\r\n\r\nWhen the leopardess threw herself the third time against the door, it\r\ngave way, and she darted in. We followed, but she had already vanished.\r\nWe sprang up a stair, and went all over the house, to find no one.\r\nDarting down again, we spied a door under the stair, and got into a\r\nlabyrinth of excavations. We had not gone far, however, when we met the\r\nleopardess with the child we sought across her back.\r\n\r\nHe told us that the woman he took for his mother threw him into a hole,\r\nsaying she would give him to the leopardess. But the leopardess was a\r\ngood one, and took him out.\r\n\r\nFollowing in search of the other boy, we got into the next house more\r\neasily, but to find, alas, that we were too late: one of the savages\r\nhad just killed the little captive! It consoled Lona, however, to learn\r\nwhich he was, for she had been expecting him to grow a bad giant, from\r\nwhich worst of fates death had saved him. The leopardess sprang upon\r\nhis murderer, took him by the throat, dragged him into the street, and\r\nfollowed Lona with him, like a cat with a great rat in her jaws.\r\n\r\n"Let us leave the horrible place," said Lona; "there are no mothers\r\nhere! This people is not worth delivering."\r\n\r\nThe leopardess dropped her burden, and charged into the crowd, this\r\nway and that, wherever it was thickest. The slaves cried out and ran,\r\ntumbling over each other in heaps.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the army, we found it as we had left it, standing in\r\norder and ready.\r\n\r\nBut I was far from easy: the princess gave no sign, and what she might\r\nbe plotting we did not know! Watch and ward must be kept the night\r\nthrough!\r\n\r\nThe Little Ones were such hardy creatures that they could repose\r\nanywhere: we told them to lie down with their animals where they were,\r\nand sleep till they were called. In one moment they were down, and\r\nin another lapt in the music of their sleep, a sound as of water over\r\ngrass, or a soft wind among leaves. Their animals slept more lightly,\r\never on the edge of waking. The bigger boys and girls walked softly\r\nhither and thither among the dreaming multitude. All was still; the\r\nwhole wicked place appeared at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nLona was so disgusted with the people, and especially with the women,\r\nthat she wished to abandon the place as soon as possible; I, on the\r\ncontrary, felt very strongly that to do so would be to fail wilfully\r\nwhere success was possible; and, far worse, to weaken the hearts of\r\nthe Little Ones, and so bring them into much greater danger. If we\r\nretreated, it was certain the princess would not leave us unassailed!\r\nif we encountered her, the hope of the prophecy went with us! Mother\r\nand daughter must meet: it might be that Lona\'s loveliness would take\r\nLilith\'s heart by storm! if she threatened violence, I should be there\r\nbetween them! If I found that I had no other power over her, I was\r\nready, for the sake of my Lona, to strike her pitilessly on the closed\r\nhand! I knew she was doomed: most likely it was decreed that her doom\r\nshould now be brought to pass through us!\r\n\r\nStill without hint of the relation in which she stood to the princess,\r\nI stated the case to Lona as it appeared to me. At once she agreed to\r\naccompany me to the palace.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of one of its great towers, the princess had, in the early\r\nmorning, while the city yet slept, descried the approach of the army of\r\nthe Little Ones. The sight awoke in her an over-mastering terror: she\r\nhad failed in her endeavour to destroy them, and they were upon her! The\r\nprophecy was about to be fulfilled!\r\n\r\nWhen she came to herself, she descended to the black hall, and seated\r\nherself in the north focus of the ellipse, under the opening in the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nFor she must think! Now what she called THINKING required a clear\r\nconsciousness of herself, not as she was, but as she chose to believe\r\nherself; and to aid her in the realisation of this consciousness, she\r\nhad suspended, a little way from and above her, itself invisible in the\r\ndarkness of the hall, a mirror to receive the full sunlight reflected\r\nfrom her person. For the resulting vision of herself in the splendour of\r\nher beauty, she sat waiting the meridional sun.\r\n\r\nMany a shadow moved about her in the darkness, but as often as, with a\r\ncertain inner eye which she had, she caught sight of one, she refused\r\nto regard it. Close under the mirror stood the Shadow which attended her\r\nwalks, but, self-occupied, him she did not see.\r\n\r\nThe city was taken; the inhabitants were cowering in terror; the Little\r\nOnes and their strange cavalry were encamped in the square; the sun\r\nshone upon the princess, and for a few minutes she saw herself glorious.\r\nThe vision passed, but she sat on. The night was now come, and darkness\r\nclothed and filled the glass, yet she did not move. A gloom that swarmed\r\nwith shadows, wallowed in the palace; the servants shivered and shook,\r\nbut dared not leave it because of the beasts of the Little Ones; all\r\nnight long the princess sat motionless: she must see her beauty again!\r\nshe must try again to think! But courage and will had grown weary of\r\nher, and would dwell with her no more!\r\n\r\nIn the morning we chose twelve of the tallest and bravest of the boys\r\nto go with us to the palace. We rode our great horses, and they small\r\nhorses and elephants.\r\n\r\nThe princess sat waiting the sun to give her the joy of her own\r\npresence. The tide of the light was creeping up the shore of the sky,\r\nbut until the sun stood overhead, not a ray could enter the black hall.\r\n\r\nHe rose to our eyes, and swiftly ascended. As we climbed the steep way\r\nto the palace, he climbed the dome of its great hall. He looked in at\r\nthe eye of it--and with sudden radiance the princess flashed upon her\r\nown sight. But she sprang to her feet with a cry of despair: alas her\r\nwhiteness! the spot covered half her side, and was black as the marble\r\naround her! She clutched her robe, and fell back in her chair. The\r\nShadow glided out, and she saw him go.\r\n\r\nWe found the gate open as usual, passed through the paved grove up to\r\nthe palace door, and entered the vestibule. There in her cage lay the\r\nspotted leopardess, apparently asleep or lifeless. The Little Ones\r\npaused a moment to look at her. She leaped up rampant against the cage.\r\nThe horses reared and plunged; the elephants retreated a step. The\r\nnext instant she fell supine, writhed in quivering spasms, and lay\r\nmotionless. We rode into the great hall.\r\n\r\nThe princess yet leaned back in her chair in the shaft of sunlight, when\r\nfrom the stones of the court came to her ears the noise of the horses\'\r\nhoofs. She started, listened, and shook: never had such sound been\r\nheard in her palace! She pressed her hand to her side, and gasped. The\r\ntrampling came nearer and nearer; it entered the hall itself; moving\r\nfigures that were not shadows approached her through the darkness!\r\n\r\nFor us, we saw a splendour, a glorious woman centring the dark. Lona\r\nsprang from her horse, and bounded to her. I sprang from mine, and\r\nfollowed Lona.\r\n\r\n"Mother! mother!" she cried, and her clear, lovely voice echoed in the\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nThe princess shivered; her face grew almost black with hate, her\r\neyebrows met on her forehead. She rose to her feet, and stood.\r\n\r\n"Mother! mother!" cried Lona again, as she leaped on the dais, and flung\r\nher arms around the princess.\r\n\r\nAn instant more and I should have reached them!--in that instant I saw\r\nLona lifted high, and dashed on the marble floor. Oh, the horrible sound\r\nof her fall! At my feet she fell, and lay still. The princess sat down\r\nwith the smile of a demoness.\r\n\r\nI dropped on my knees beside Lona, raised her from the stones, and\r\npressed her to my bosom. With indignant hate I glanced at the princess;\r\nshe answered me with her sweetest smile. I would have sprung upon her,\r\ntaken her by the throat, and strangled her, but love of the child was\r\nstronger than hate of the mother, and I clasped closer my precious\r\nburden. Her arms hung helpless; her blood trickled over my hands, and\r\nfell on the floor with soft, slow little plashes.\r\n\r\nThe horses scented it--mine first, then the small ones. Mine reared,\r\nshivering and wild-eyed, went about, and thundered blindly down the dark\r\nhall, with the little horses after him. Lona\'s stood gazing down at his\r\nmistress, and trembling all over. The boys flung themselves from their\r\nhorses\' backs, and they, not seeing the black wall before them, dashed\r\nthemselves, with mine, to pieces against it. The elephants came on to\r\nthe foot of the dais, and stopped, wildly trumpeting; the Little Ones\r\nsprang upon it, and stood horrified; the princess lay back in her seat,\r\nher face that of a corpse, her eyes alone alive, wickedly flaming. She\r\nwas again withered and wasted to what I found in the wood, and her side\r\nwas as if a great branding hand had been laid upon it. But Lona saw\r\nnothing, and I saw but Lona.\r\n\r\n"Mother! mother!" she sighed, and her breathing ceased.\r\n\r\nI carried her into the court: the sun shone upon a white face, and the\r\npitiful shadow of a ghostly smile. Her head hung back. She was "dead as\r\nearth."\r\n\r\nI forgot the Little Ones, forgot the murdering princess, forgot the\r\nbody in my arms, and wandered away, looking for my Lona. The doors and\r\nwindows were crowded with brute-faces jeering at me, but not daring to\r\nspeak, for they saw the white leopardess behind me, hanging her head\r\nclose at my heel. I spurned her with my foot. She held back a moment,\r\nand followed me again.\r\n\r\nI reached the square: the little army was gone! Its emptiness roused me.\r\nWhere were the Little Ones, HER Little Ones? I had lost her children!\r\nI stared helpless about me, staggered to the pillar, and sank upon its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nBut as I sat gazing on the still countenance, it seemed to smile a live\r\nmomentary smile. I never doubted it an illusion, yet believed what it\r\nsaid: I should yet see her alive! It was not she, it was I who was lost,\r\nand she would find me!\r\n\r\nI rose to go after the Little Ones, and instinctively sought the gate\r\nby which we had entered. I looked around me, but saw nothing of the\r\nleopardess.\r\n\r\nThe street was rapidly filling with a fierce crowd. They saw me\r\nencumbered with my dead, but for a time dared not assail me. Ere I\r\nreached the gate, however, they had gathered courage. The women began\r\nto hustle me; I held on heedless. A man pushed against my sacred burden:\r\nwith a kick I sent him away howling. But the crowd pressed upon me, and\r\nfearing for the dead that was beyond hurt, I clasped my treasure closer,\r\nand freed my right arm. That instant, however, a commotion arose in the\r\nstreet behind me; the crowd broke; and through it came the Little Ones I\r\nhad left in the palace. Ten of them were upon four of the elephants; on\r\nthe two other elephants lay the princess, bound hand and foot, and quite\r\nstill, save that her eyes rolled in their ghastly sockets. The two other\r\nLittle Ones rode behind her on Lona\'s horse. Every now and then the wise\r\ncreatures that bore her threw their trunks behind and felt her cords.\r\n\r\nI walked on in front, and out of the city. What an end to the hopes with\r\nwhich I entered the evil place! We had captured the bad princess, and\r\nlost our all-beloved queen! My life was bare! my heart was empty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. THE SHADOW\r\n\r\nA murmur of pleasure from my companions roused me: they had caught sight\r\nof their fellows in the distance! The two on Lona\'s horse rode on to\r\njoin them. They were greeted with a wavering shout--which immediately\r\ndied away. As we drew near, the sound of their sobs reached us like the\r\nbreaking of tiny billows.\r\n\r\nWhen I came among them, I saw that something dire had befallen them: on\r\ntheir childish faces was the haggard look left by some strange terror.\r\nNo possible grief could have wrought the change. A few of them came\r\nslowly round me, and held out their arms to take my burden. I yielded\r\nit; the tender hopelessness of the smile with which they received it,\r\nmade my heart swell with pity in the midst of its own desolation. In\r\nvain were their sobs over their mother-queen; in vain they sought to\r\nentice from her some recognition of their love; in vain they kissed and\r\nfondled her as they bore her away: she would not wake! On each side one\r\ncarried an arm, gently stroking it; as many as could get near, put their\r\narms under her body; those who could not, crowded around the bearers. On\r\na spot where the grass grew thicker and softer they laid her down, and\r\nthere all the Little Ones gathered sobbing.\r\n\r\nOutside the crowd stood the elephants, and I near them, gazing at my\r\nLona over the many little heads between. Those next me caught sight of\r\nthe princess, and stared trembling. Odu was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"I have seen that woman before!" he whispered to his next neighbour.\r\n"It was she who fought the white leopardess, the night they woke us with\r\ntheir yelling!"\r\n\r\n"Silly!" returned his companion. "That was a wild beast, with spots!"\r\n\r\n"Look at her eyes!" insisted Odu. "I know she is a bad giantess, but she\r\nis a wild beast all the same. I know she is the spotted one!"\r\n\r\nThe other took a step nearer; Odu drew him back with a sharp pull.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look at her!" he cried, shrinking away, yet fascinated by the\r\nhate-filled longing in her eyes. "She would eat you up in a moment! It\r\nwas HER shadow! She is the wicked princess!"\r\n\r\n"That cannot be! they said she was beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is the princess!" I interposed. "Wickedness has made her\r\nugly!"\r\n\r\nShe heard, and what a look was hers!\r\n\r\n"It was very wrong of me to run away!" said Odu thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"What made you run away?" I asked. "I expected to find you where I left\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply at once.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what made me run," answered another. "I was frightened!"\r\n\r\n"It was a man that came down the hill from the palace," said a third.\r\n\r\n"How did he frighten you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t a man," said Odu; "he was a shadow; he had no thick to him!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me more about him."\r\n\r\n"He came down the hill very black, walking like a bad giant, but spread\r\nflat. He was nothing but blackness. We were frightened the moment we saw\r\nhim, but we did not run away; we stood and watched him. He came on as if\r\nhe would walk over us. But before he reached us, he began to spread and\r\nspread, and grew bigger end bigger, till at last he was so big that he\r\nwent out of our sight, and we saw him no more, and then he was upon us!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"He was all black through between us, and we could not see one another;\r\nand then he was inside us."\r\n\r\n"How did you know he was inside you?"\r\n\r\n"He did me quite different. I felt like bad. I was not Odu any more--not\r\nthe Odu I knew. I wanted to tear Sozo to pieces--not really, but like!"\r\n\r\nHe turned and hugged Sozo.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t me, Sozo," he sobbed. "Really, deep down, it was Odu, loving\r\nyou always! And Odu came up, and knocked Naughty away. I grew sick, and\r\nthought I must kill myself to get out of the black. Then came a horrible\r\nlaugh that had heard my think, and it set the air trembling about me.\r\nAnd then I suppose I ran away, but I did not know I had run away until\r\nI found myself running, fast as could, and all the rest running too.\r\nI would have stopped, but I never thought of it until I was out of the\r\ngate among the grass. Then I knew that I had run away from a shadow that\r\nwanted to be me and wasn\'t, and that I was the Odu that loved Sozo. It\r\nwas the shadow that got into me, and hated him from inside me; it was\r\nnot my own self me! And now I know that I ought not to have run away!\r\nBut indeed I did not quite know what I was doing until it was done! My\r\nlegs did it, I think: they grew frightened, and forgot me, and ran away!\r\nNaughty legs! There! and there!"\r\n\r\nThus ended Odu, with a kick to each of his naughty legs.\r\n\r\n"What became of the shadow?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," he answered. "I suppose he went home into the night\r\nwhere there is no moon."\r\n\r\nI fell a wondering where Lona was gone, and dropping on the grass, took\r\nthe dead thing in my lap, and whispered in its ear, "Where are you,\r\nLona? I love you!" But its lips gave no answer. I kissed them, not quite\r\ncold, laid the body down again, and appointing a guard over it, rose to\r\nprovide for the safety of Lona\'s people during the night.\r\n\r\nBefore the sun went down, I had set a watch over the princess outside\r\nthe camp, and sentinels round it: intending to walk about it myself\r\nall night long, I told the rest of the army to go to sleep. They threw\r\nthemselves on the grass and were asleep in a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose I caught a glimpse of something white; it was the\r\nleopardess. She swept silently round the sleeping camp, and I saw her\r\npass three times between the princess and the Little Ones. Thereupon I\r\nmade the watch lie down with the others, and stretched myself beside the\r\nbody of Lona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. TO THE HOUSE OF BITTERNESS\r\n\r\nIn the morning we set out, and made for the forest as fast as we could.\r\nI rode Lona\'s horse, and carried her body. I would take it to her\r\nfather: he would give it a couch in the chamber of his dead! or, if he\r\nwould not, seeing she had not come of herself, I would watch it in the\r\ndesert until it mouldered away! But I believed he would, for surely she\r\nhad died long ago! Alas, how bitterly must I not humble myself before\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nTo Adam I must take Lilith also. I had no power to make her repent! I\r\nhad hardly a right to slay her--much less a right to let her loose in\r\nthe world! and surely I scarce merited being made for ever her gaoler!\r\n\r\nAgain and again, on the way, I offered her food; but she answered only\r\nwith a look of hungering hate. Her fiery eyes kept rolling to and fro,\r\nnor ever closed, I believe, until we reached the other side of the\r\nhot stream. After that they never opened until we came to the House of\r\nBitterness.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as we were camping for the night, I saw a little girl go\r\nup to her, and ran to prevent mischief. But ere I could reach them, the\r\nchild had put something to the lips of the princess, and given a scream\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\n"Please, king," she whimpered, "suck finger. Bad giantess make hole in\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nI sucked the tiny finger.\r\n\r\n"Well now!" she cried, and a minute after was holding a second fruit\r\nto a mouth greedy of other fare. But this time she snatched her hand\r\nquickly away, and the fruit fell to the ground. The child\'s name was\r\nLuva.\r\n\r\nThe next day we crossed the hot stream. Again on their own ground,\r\nthe Little Ones were jubilant. But their nests were still at a great\r\ndistance, and that day we went no farther than the ivy-hall, where,\r\nbecause of its grapes, I had resolved to spend the night. When they saw\r\nthe great clusters, at once they knew them good, rushed upon them, ate\r\neagerly, and in a few minutes were all fast asleep on the green floor\r\nand in the forest around the hall. Hoping again to see the dance, and\r\nexpecting the Little Ones to sleep through it, I had made them leave a\r\nwide space in the middle. I lay down among them, with Lona by my side,\r\nbut did not sleep.\r\n\r\nThe night came, and suddenly the company was there. I was wondering with\r\nmyself whether, night after night, they would thus go on dancing to all\r\neternity, and whether I should not one day have to join them because of\r\nmy stiff-neckedness, when the eyes of the children came open, and they\r\nsprang to their feet, wide awake. Immediately every one caught hold of\r\na dancer, and away they went, bounding and skipping. The spectres seemed\r\nto see and welcome them: perhaps they knew all about the Little Ones,\r\nfor they had themselves long been on their way back to childhood!\r\nAnyhow, their innocent gambols must, I thought, bring refreshment to\r\nweary souls who, their present taken from them and their future dark,\r\nhad no life save the shadow of their vanished past. Many a merry but\r\nnever a rude prank did the children play; and if they did at times cause\r\na momentary jar in the rhythm of the dance, the poor spectres, who had\r\nnothing to smile withal, at least manifested no annoyance.\r\n\r\nJust ere the morning began to break, I started to see the\r\nskeleton-princess in the doorway, her eyes open and glowing, the fearful\r\nspot black on her side. She stood for a moment, then came gliding in,\r\nas if she would join the dance. I sprang to my feet. A cry of repugnant\r\nfear broke from the children, and the lights vanished. But the low\r\nmoon looked in, and I saw them clinging to each other. The ghosts\r\nwere gone--at least they were no longer visible. The princess too had\r\ndisappeared. I darted to the spot where I had left her: she lay with\r\nher eyes closed, as if she had never moved. I returned to the hall. The\r\nLittle Ones were already on the floor, composing themselves to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as we started, we spied, a little way from us, two\r\nskeletons moving about in a thicket. The Little Ones broke their ranks,\r\nand ran to them. I followed; and, although now walking at ease, without\r\nsplint or ligature, I was able to recognise the pair I had before seen\r\nin that neighbourhood. The children at once made friends with them,\r\nlaying hold of their arms, and stroking the bones of their long fingers;\r\nand it was plain the poor creatures took their attentions kindly. The\r\ntwo seemed on excellent terms with each other. Their common deprivation\r\nhad drawn them together! the loss of everything had been the beginning\r\nof a new life to them!\r\n\r\nPerceiving that they had gathered handfuls of herbs, and were looking\r\nfor more--presumably to rub their bones with, for in what other way\r\ncould nourishment reach their system so rudimentary?--the Little Ones,\r\nhaving keenly examined those they held, gathered of the same sorts, and\r\nfilled the hands the skeletons held out to receive them. Then they bid\r\nthem goodbye, promising to come and see them again, and resumed their\r\njourney, saying to each other they had not known there were such nice\r\npeople living in the same forest.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the nest-village, I remained there a night with them, to\r\nsee them resettled; for Lona still looked like one just dead, and there\r\nseemed no need of haste.\r\n\r\nThe princess had eaten nothing, and her eyes remained shut: fearing she\r\nmight die ere we reached the end of our journey, I went to her in the\r\nnight, and laid my bare arm upon her lips. She bit into it so fiercely\r\nthat I cried out. How I got away from her I do not know, but I came to\r\nmyself lying beyond her reach. It was then morning, and immediately I\r\nset about our departure.\r\n\r\nChoosing twelve Little Ones, not of the biggest and strongest, but of\r\nthe sweetest and merriest, I mounted them on six elephants, and took\r\ntwo more of the wise CLUMSIES, as the children called them, to bear the\r\nprincess. I still rode Lona\'s horse, and carried her body wrapt in\r\nher cloak before me. As nearly as I could judge I took the direct way,\r\nacross the left branch of the river-bed, to the House of Bitterness,\r\nwhere I hoped to learn how best to cross the broader and rougher branch,\r\nand how to avoid the basin of monsters: I dreaded the former for the\r\nelephants, the latter for the children.\r\n\r\nI had one terrible night on the way--the third, passed in the desert\r\nbetween the two branches of the dead river.\r\n\r\nWe had stopped the elephants in a sheltered place, and there let the\r\nprincess slip down between them, to lie on the sand until the morning.\r\nShe seemed quite dead, but I did not think she was. I laid myself a\r\nlittle way from her, with the body of Lona by my other side, thus\r\nto keep watch at once over the dead and the dangerous. The moon was\r\nhalf-way down the west, a pale, thoughtful moon, mottling the desert\r\nwith shadows. Of a sudden she was eclipsed, remaining visible, but\r\nsending forth no light: a thick, diaphanous film covered her patient\r\nbeauty, and she looked troubled. The film swept a little aside, and\r\nI saw the edge of it against her clearness--the jagged outline of\r\na bat-like wing, torn and hooked. Came a cold wind with a burning\r\nsting--and Lilith was upon me. Her hands were still bound, but with her\r\nteeth she pulled from my shoulder the cloak Lona made for me, and fixed\r\nthem in my flesh. I lay as one paralysed.\r\n\r\nAlready the very life seemed flowing from me into her, when I\r\nremembered, and struck her on the hand. She raised her head with a\r\ngurgling shriek, and I felt her shiver. I flung her from me, and sprang\r\nto my feet.\r\n\r\nShe was on her knees, and rocked herself to and fro. A second blast of\r\nhot-stinging cold enveloped us; the moon shone out clear, and I saw her\r\nface--gaunt and ghastly, besmeared with red.\r\n\r\n"Down, devil!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Where are you taking me?" she asked, with the voice of a dull echo from\r\na sepulchre.\r\n\r\n"To your first husband," I answered.\r\n\r\n"He will kill me!" she moaned.\r\n\r\n"At least he will take you off my hands!"\r\n\r\n"Give me my daughter," she suddenly screamed, grinding her teeth.\r\n\r\n"Never! Your doom is upon you at last!"\r\n\r\n"Loose my hands for pity\'s sake!" she groaned. "I am in torture. The\r\ncords are sunk in my flesh."\r\n\r\n"I dare not. Lie down!" I said.\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on the ground like a log.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the night passed in peace, and in the morning she again\r\nseemed dead.\r\n\r\nBefore evening we came in sight of the House of Bitterness, and the next\r\nmoment one of the elephants came alongside of my horse.\r\n\r\n"Please, king, you are not going to that place?" whispered the Little\r\nOne who rode on his neck.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am! We are going to stay the night there," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, don\'t! That must be where the cat-woman lives!"\r\n\r\n"If you had ever seen her, you would not call her by that name!"\r\n\r\n"Nobody ever sees her: she has lost her face! Her head is back and side\r\nall round."\r\n\r\n"She hides her face from dull, discontented people!--Who taught you to\r\ncall her the cat-woman?"\r\n\r\n"I heard the bad giants call her so."\r\n\r\n"What did they say about her?"\r\n\r\n"That she had claws to her toes."\r\n\r\n"It is not true. I know the lady. I spent a night at her house."\r\n\r\n"But she MAY have claws to her toes! You might see her feet, and her\r\nclaws be folded up inside their cushions!"\r\n\r\n"Then perhaps you think that I have claws to my toes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; that can\'t be! you are good!"\r\n\r\n"The giants might have told you so!" I pursued.\r\n\r\n"We shouldn\'t believe them about you!"\r\n\r\n"Are the giants good?"\r\n\r\n"No; they love lying."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you believe them about her? I know the lady is good; she\r\ncannot have claws."\r\n\r\n"Please how do you know she is good?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know I am good?"\r\n\r\nI rode on, while he waited for his companions, and told them what I had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThey hastened after me, and when they came up,--\r\n\r\n"I would not take you to her house if I did not believe her good," I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"We know you would not," they answered.\r\n\r\n"If I were to do something that frightened you--what would you say?"\r\n\r\n"The beasts frightened us sometimes at first, but they never hurt us!"\r\nanswered one.\r\n\r\n"That was before we knew them!" added another.\r\n\r\n"Just so!" I answered. "When you see the woman in that cottage, you will\r\nknow that she is good. You may wonder at what she does, but she will\r\nalways be good. I know her better than you know me. She will not hurt\r\nyou,--or if she does,----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are not sure about it, king dear! You think she MAY hurt us!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure she will never be unkind to you, even if she do hurt you!"\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of being hurt--a little!--a good deal!" cried Odu. "But\r\nI should not like scratches in the dark! The giants say the cat-woman\r\nhas claw-feet all over her house!"\r\n\r\n"I am taking the princess to her," I said.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because she is her friend."\r\n\r\n"How can she be good then?"\r\n\r\n"Little Tumbledown is a friend of the princess," I answered; "so is\r\nLuva: I saw them both, more than once, trying to feed her with grapes!"\r\n\r\n"Little Tumbledown is good! Luva is very good!"\r\n\r\n"That is why they are her friends."\r\n\r\n"Will the cat-woman--I mean the woman that isn\'t the cat-woman, and has\r\nno claws to her toes--give her grapes?"\r\n\r\n"She is more likely to give her scratches!"\r\n\r\n"Why?--You say she is her friend!"\r\n\r\n"That is just why.--A friend is one who gives us what we need, and the\r\nprincess is sorely in need of a terrible scratching."\r\n\r\nThey were silent again.\r\n\r\n"If any of you are afraid," I said, "you may go home; I shall not\r\nprevent you. But I cannot take one with me who believes the giants\r\nrather than me, or one who will call a good lady the cat-woman!"\r\n\r\n"Please, king," said one, "I\'m so afraid of being afraid!"\r\n\r\n"My boy," I answered, "there is no harm in being afraid. The only harm\r\nis in doing what Fear tells you. Fear is not your master! Laugh in his\r\nface and he will run away."\r\n\r\n"There she is--in the door waiting for us!" cried one, and put his hands\r\nover his eyes.\r\n\r\n"How ugly she is!" cried another, and did the same.\r\n\r\n"You do not see her," I said; "her face is covered!"\r\n\r\n"She has no face!" they answered.\r\n\r\n"She has a very beautiful face. I saw it once.--It is indeed as\r\nbeautiful as Lona\'s!" I added with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Then what makes her hide it?"\r\n\r\n"I think I know:--anyhow, she has some good reason for it!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the cat-woman! she is frightful!"\r\n\r\n"You cannot like, and you ought not to dislike what you have never\r\nseen.--Once more, you must not call her the cat-woman!"\r\n\r\n"What are we to call her then, please?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Mara."\r\n\r\n"That is a pretty name!" said a girl; "I will call her \'lady Mara\'; then\r\nperhaps she will show me her beautiful face!"\r\n\r\nMara, drest and muffled in white, was indeed standing in the doorway to\r\nreceive us.\r\n\r\n"At last!" she said. "Lilith\'s hour has been long on the way, but it\r\nis come! Everything comes. Thousands of years have I waited--and not in\r\nvain!"\r\n\r\nShe came to me, took my treasure from my arms, carried it into the\r\nhouse, and returning, took the princess. Lilith shuddered, but made no\r\nresistance. The beasts lay down by the door. We followed our hostess,\r\nthe Little Ones looking very grave. She laid the princess on a rough\r\nsettle at one side of the room, unbound her, and turned to us.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vane," she said, "and you, Little Ones, I thank you! This woman\r\nwould not yield to gentler measures; harder must have their turn. I must\r\ndo what I can to make her repent!"\r\n\r\nThe pitiful-hearted Little Ones began to sob sorely.\r\n\r\n"Will you hurt her very much, lady Mara?" said the girl I have just\r\nmentioned, putting her warm little hand in mine.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am afraid I must; I fear she will make me!" answered Mara. "It\r\nwould be cruel to hurt her too little. It would have all to be done\r\nagain, only worse."\r\n\r\n"May I stop with her?"\r\n\r\n"No, my child. She loves no one, therefore she cannot be WITH any one.\r\nThere is One who will be with her, but she will not be with Him."\r\n\r\n"Will the shadow that came down the hill be with her?"\r\n\r\n"The great Shadow will be in her, I fear, but he cannot be WITH her, or\r\nwith any one. She will know I am beside her, but that will not comfort\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Will you scratch her very deep?" asked Odu, going near, and putting his\r\nhand in hers. "Please, don\'t make the red juice come!"\r\n\r\nShe caught him up, turned her back to the rest of us, drew the muffling\r\ndown from her face, and held him at arms\' length that he might see her.\r\n\r\nAs if his face had been a mirror, I saw in it what he saw. For one\r\nmoment he stared, his little mouth open; then a divine wonder arose in\r\nhis countenance, and swiftly changed to intense delight. For a minute he\r\ngazed entranced, then she set him down. Yet a moment he stood looking up\r\nat her, lost in contemplation--then ran to us with the face of a prophet\r\nthat knows a bliss he cannot tell. Mara rearranged her mufflings, and\r\nturned to the other children.\r\n\r\n"You must eat and drink before you go to sleep," she said; "you have had\r\na long journey!"\r\n\r\nShe set the bread of her house before them, and a jug of cold water.\r\nThey had never seen bread before, and this was hard and dry, but they\r\nate it without sign of distaste. They had never seen water before,\r\nbut they drank without demur, one after the other looking up from\r\nthe draught with a face of glad astonishment. Then she led away the\r\nsmallest, and the rest went trooping after her. With her own gentle\r\nhands, they told me, she put them to bed on the floor of the garret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. THAT NIGHT\r\n\r\nTheir night was a troubled one, and they brought a strange report of\r\nit into the day. Whether the fear of their sleep came out into their\r\nwaking, or their waking fear sank with them into their dreams, awake or\r\nasleep they were never at rest from it. All night something seemed going\r\non in the house--something silent, something terrible, something they\r\nwere not to know. Never a sound awoke; the darkness was one with the\r\nsilence, and the silence was the terror.\r\n\r\nOnce, a frightful wind filled the house, and shook its inside, they\r\nsaid, so that it quivered and trembled like a horse shaking himself;\r\nbut it was a silent wind that made not even a moan in their chamber, and\r\npassed away like a soundless sob.\r\n\r\nThey fell asleep. But they woke again with a great start. They thought\r\nthe house was filling with water such as they had been drinking. It came\r\nfrom below, and swelled up until the garret was full of it to the very\r\nroof. But it made no more sound than the wind, and when it sank away,\r\nthey fell asleep dry and warm.\r\n\r\nThe next time they woke, all the air, they said, inside and out, was\r\nfull of cats. They swarmed--up and down, along and across, everywhere\r\nabout the room. They felt their claws trying to get through the\r\nnight-gowns lady Mara had put on them, but they could not; and in the\r\nmorning not one of them had a scratch. Through the dark suddenly, came\r\nthe only sound they heard the night long--the far-off howl of the huge\r\ngreat-grandmother-cat in the desert: she must have been calling her\r\nlittle ones, they thought, for that instant the cats stopped, and all\r\nwas still. Once more they fell fast asleep, and did not wake till the\r\nsun was rising.\r\n\r\nSuch was the account the children gave of their experiences. But I was\r\nwith the veiled woman and the princess all through the night: something\r\nof what took place I saw; much I only felt; and there was more which eye\r\ncould not see, and heart only could in a measure understand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mara left the room with the children, my eyes fell on the\r\nwhite leopardess: I thought we had left her behind us, but there she\r\nwas, cowering in a corner. Apparently she was in mortal terror of what\r\nshe might see. A lamp stood on the high chimney-piece, and sometimes\r\nthe room seemed full of lamp-shadows, sometimes of cloudy forms. The\r\nprincess lay on the settle by the wall, and seemed never to have moved\r\nhand or foot. It was a fearsome waiting.\r\n\r\nWhen Mara returned, she drew the settle with Lilith upon it to the\r\nmiddle of the room, then sat down opposite me, at the other side of the\r\nhearth. Between us burned a small fire.\r\n\r\nSomething terrible was on its way! The cloudy presences flickered and\r\nshook. A silvery creature like a slowworm came crawling out from among\r\nthem, slowly crossed the clay floor, and crept into the fire. We sat\r\nmotionless. The something came nearer.\r\n\r\nBut the hours passed, midnight drew nigh, and there was no change. The\r\nnight was very still. Not a sound broke the silence, not a rustle from\r\nthe fire, not a crack from board or beam. Now and again I felt a sort of\r\nheave, but whether in the earth or in the air or in the waters under the\r\nearth, whether in my own body or in my soul--whether it was anywhere,\r\nI could not tell. A dread sense of judgment was upon me. But I was not\r\nafraid, for I had ceased to care for aught save the thing that must be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it was midnight. The muffled woman rose, turned toward the\r\nsettle, and slowly unwound the long swathes that hid her face: they\r\ndropped on the ground, and she stepped over them. The feet of the\r\nprincess were toward the hearth; Mara went to her head, and turning,\r\nstood behind it. Then I saw her face. It was lovely beyond speech--white\r\nand sad, heart-and-soul sad, but not unhappy, and I knew it never could\r\nbe unhappy. Great tears were running down her cheeks: she wiped them\r\naway with her robe; her countenance grew very still, and she wept no\r\nmore. But for the pity in every line of her expression, she would have\r\nseemed severe. She laid her hand on the head of the princess--on the\r\nhair that grew low on the forehead, and stooping, breathed on the sallow\r\nbrow. The body shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Will you turn away from the wicked things you have been doing so long?"\r\nsaid Mara gently.\r\n\r\nThe princess did not answer. Mara put the question again, in the same\r\nsoft, inviting tone.\r\n\r\nStill there was no sign of hearing. She spoke the words a third time.\r\n\r\nThen the seeming corpse opened its mouth and answered, its words\r\nappearing to frame themselves of something else than sound.--I cannot\r\nshape the thing further: sounds they were not, yet they were words to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"I will not," she said. "I will be myself and not another!"\r\n\r\n"Alas, you are another now, not yourself! Will you not be your real\r\nself?"\r\n\r\n"I will be what I mean myself now."\r\n\r\n"If you were restored, would you not make what amends you could for the\r\nmisery you have caused?"\r\n\r\n"I would do after my nature."\r\n\r\n"You do not know it: your nature is good, and you do evil!"\r\n\r\n"I will do as my Self pleases--as my Self desires."\r\n\r\n"You will do as the Shadow, overshadowing your Self inclines you?"\r\n\r\n"I will do what I will to do."\r\n\r\n"You have killed your daughter, Lilith!"\r\n\r\n"I have killed thousands. She is my own!"\r\n\r\n"She was never yours as you are another\'s."\r\n\r\n"I am not another\'s; I am my own, and my daughter is mine."\r\n\r\n"Then, alas, your hour is come!"\r\n\r\n"I care not. I am what I am; no one can take from me myself!"\r\n\r\n"You are not the Self you imagine."\r\n\r\n"So long as I feel myself what it pleases me to think myself, I care\r\nnot. I am content to be to myself what I would be. What I choose to seem\r\nto myself makes me what I am. My own thought makes me me; my own thought\r\nof myself is me. Another shall not make me!"\r\n\r\n"But another has made you, and can compel you to see what you have made\r\nyourself. You will not be able much longer to look to yourself anything\r\nbut what he sees you! You will not much longer have satisfaction in the\r\nthought of yourself. At this moment you are aware of the coming change!"\r\n\r\n"No one ever made me. I defy that Power to unmake me from a free woman!\r\nYou are his slave, and I defy you! You may be able to torture me--I do\r\nnot know, but you shall not compel me to anything against my will!"\r\n\r\n"Such a compulsion would be without value. But there is a light that\r\ngoes deeper than the will, a light that lights up the darkness behind\r\nit: that light can change your will, can make it truly yours and not\r\nanother\'s--not the Shadow\'s. Into the created can pour itself the\r\ncreating will, and so redeem it!"\r\n\r\n"That light shall not enter me: I hate it!--Begone, slave!"\r\n\r\n"I am no slave, for I love that light, and will with the deeper will\r\nwhich created mine. There is no slave but the creature that wills\r\nagainst its creator. Who is a slave but her who cries, \'I am free,\' yet\r\ncannot cease to exist!"\r\n\r\n"You speak foolishness from a cowering heart! You imagine me given over\r\nto you: I defy you! I hold myself against you! What I choose to be, you\r\ncannot change. I will not be what you think me--what you say I am!"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry: you must suffer!"\r\n\r\n"But be free!"\r\n\r\n"She alone is free who would make free; she loves not freedom who would\r\nenslave: she is herself a slave. Every life, every will, every heart\r\nthat came within your ken, you have sought to subdue: you are the slave\r\nof every slave you have made--such a slave that you do not know it!--See\r\nyour own self!"\r\n\r\nShe took her hand from the head of the princess, and went two backward\r\npaces from her.\r\n\r\nA soundless presence as of roaring flame possessed the house--the same,\r\nI presume, that was to the children a silent wind. Involuntarily I\r\nturned to the hearth: its fire was a still small moveless glow. But I\r\nsaw the worm-thing come creeping out, white-hot, vivid as incandescent\r\nsilver, the live heart of essential fire. Along the floor it crawled\r\ntoward the settle, going very slow. Yet more slowly it crept up on\r\nit, and laid itself, as unwilling to go further, at the feet of the\r\nprincess. I rose and stole nearer. Mara stood motionless, as one that\r\nwaits an event foreknown. The shining thing crawled on to a bare bony\r\nfoot: it showed no suffering, neither was the settle scorched where the\r\nworm had lain. Slowly, very slowly, it crept along her robe until it\r\nreached her bosom, where it disappeared among the folds.\r\n\r\nThe face of the princess lay stonily calm, the eyelids closed as over\r\ndead eyes; and for some minutes nothing followed. At length, on the dry,\r\nparchment-like skin, began to appear drops as of the finest dew: in a\r\nmoment they were as large as seed-pearls, ran together, and began to\r\npour down in streams. I darted forward to snatch the worm from the poor\r\nwithered bosom, and crush it with my foot. But Mara, Mother of Sorrow,\r\nstepped between, and drew aside the closed edges of the robe: no serpent\r\nwas there--no searing trail; the creature had passed in by the centre\r\nof the black spot, and was piercing through the joints and marrow to\r\nthe thoughts and intents of the heart. The princess gave one writhing,\r\ncontorted shudder, and I knew the worm was in her secret chamber.\r\n\r\n"She is seeing herself!" said Mara; and laying her hand on my arm, she\r\ndrew me three paces from the settle.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden the princess bent her body upward in an arch, then sprang to\r\nthe floor, and stood erect. The horror in her face made me tremble lest\r\nher eyes should open, and the sight of them overwhelm me. Her bosom\r\nheaved and sank, but no breath issued. Her hair hung and dripped; then\r\nit stood out from her head and emitted sparks; again hung down, and\r\npoured the sweat of her torture on the floor.\r\n\r\nI would have thrown my arms about her, but Mara stopped me.\r\n\r\n"You cannot go near her," she said. "She is far away from us, afar in\r\nthe hell of her self-consciousness. The central fire of the universe is\r\nradiating into her the knowledge of good and evil, the knowledge of what\r\nshe is. She sees at last the good she is not, the evil she is. She knows\r\nthat she is herself the fire in which she is burning, but she does not\r\nknow that the Light of Life is the heart of that fire. Her torment is\r\nthat she is what she is. Do not fear for her; she is not forsaken. No\r\ngentler way to help her was left. Wait and watch."\r\n\r\nIt may have been five minutes or five years that she stood thus--I\r\ncannot tell; but at last she flung herself on her face.\r\n\r\nMara went to her, and stood looking down upon her. Large tears fell from\r\nher eyes on the woman who had never wept, and would not weep.\r\n\r\n"Will you change your way?" she said at length.\r\n\r\n"Why did he make me such?" gasped Lilith. "I would have made myself--oh,\r\nso different! I am glad it was he that made me and not I myself!\r\nHe alone is to blame for what I am! Never would I have made such a\r\nworthless thing! He meant me such that I might know it and be miserable!\r\nI will not be made any longer!"\r\n\r\n"Unmake yourself, then," said Mara.\r\n\r\n"Alas, I cannot! You know it, and mock me! How often have I not agonised\r\nto cease, but the tyrant keeps me being! I curse him!--Now let him kill\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nThe words came in jets as from a dying fountain.\r\n\r\n"Had he not made you," said Mara, gently and slowly, "you could not even\r\nhate him. But he did not make you such. You have made yourself what you\r\nare.--Be of better cheer: he can remake you."\r\n\r\n"I will not be remade!"\r\n\r\n"He will not change you; he will only restore you to what you were."\r\n\r\n"I will not be aught of his making."\r\n\r\n"Are you not willing to have that set right which you have set wrong?"\r\n\r\nShe lay silent; her suffering seemed abated.\r\n\r\n"If you are willing, put yourself again on the settle."\r\n\r\n"I will not," she answered, forcing the words through her clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nA wind seemed to wake inside the house, blowing without sound or impact;\r\nand a water began to rise that had no lap in its ripples, no sob in its\r\nswell. It was cold, but it did not benumb. Unseen and noiseless it came.\r\nIt smote no sense in me, yet I knew it rising. I saw it lift at last and\r\nfloat her. Gently it bore her, unable to resist, and left rather than\r\nlaid her on the settle. Then it sank swiftly away.\r\n\r\nThe strife of thought, accusing and excusing, began afresh, and\r\ngathered fierceness. The soul of Lilith lay naked to the torture of pure\r\ninterpenetrating inward light. She began to moan, and sigh deep sighs,\r\nthen murmur as holding colloquy with a dividual self: her queendom was\r\nno longer whole; it was divided against itself. One moment she would\r\nexult as over her worst enemy, and weep; the next she would writhe as in\r\nthe embrace of a friend whom her soul hated, and laugh like a demon.\r\nAt length she began what seemed a tale about herself, in a language\r\nso strange, and in forms so shadowy, that I could but here and there\r\nunderstand a little. Yet the language seemed the primeval shape of one\r\nI knew well, and the forms to belong to dreams which had once been mine,\r\nbut refused to be recalled. The tale appeared now and then to touch upon\r\nthings that Adam had read from the disparted manuscript, and often to\r\nmake allusion to influences and forces--vices too, I could not help\r\nsuspecting--with which I was unacquainted.\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and again came the horror in her hair, the sparkling and\r\nflowing alternate. I sent a beseeching look to Mara.\r\n\r\n"Those, alas, are not the tears of repentance!" she said. "The true\r\ntears gather in the eyes. Those are far more bitter, and not so good.\r\nSelf-loathing is not sorrow. Yet it is good, for it marks a step in\r\nthe way home, and in the father\'s arms the prodigal forgets the self he\r\nabominates. Once with his father, he is to himself of no more account.\r\nIt will be so with her."\r\n\r\nShe went nearer and said,\r\n\r\n"Will you restore that which you have wrongfully taken?"\r\n\r\n"I have taken nothing," answered the princess, forcing out the words\r\nin spite of pain, "that I had not the right to take. My power to take\r\nmanifested my right."\r\n\r\nMara left her.\r\n\r\nGradually my soul grew aware of an invisible darkness, a something\r\nmore terrible than aught that had yet made itself felt. A horrible\r\nNothingness, a Negation positive infolded her; the border of its being\r\nthat was yet no being, touched me, and for one ghastly instant I seemed\r\nalone with Death Absolute! It was not the absence of everything I felt,\r\nbut the presence of Nothing. The princess dashed herself from the settle\r\nto the floor with an exceeding great and bitter cry. It was the recoil\r\nof Being from Annihilation.\r\n\r\n"For pity\'s sake," she shrieked, "tear my heart out, but let me live!"\r\n\r\nWith that there fell upon her, and upon us also who watched with her,\r\nthe perfect calm as of a summer night. Suffering had all but reached the\r\nbrim of her life\'s cup, and a hand had emptied it! She raised her head,\r\nhalf rose, and looked around her. A moment more, and she stood erect,\r\nwith the air of a conqueror: she had won the battle! Dareful she had met\r\nher spiritual foes; they had withdrawn defeated! She raised her withered\r\narm above her head, a paean of unholy triumph in her throat--when\r\nsuddenly her eyes fixed in a ghastly stare.--What was she seeing?\r\n\r\nI looked, and saw: before her, cast from unseen heavenly mirror, stood\r\nthe reflection of herself, and beside it a form of splendent beauty, She\r\ntrembled, and sank again on the floor helpless. She knew the one what\r\nGod had intended her to be, the other what she had made herself.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the night she lay motionless altogether.\r\n\r\nWith the gray dawn growing in the room, she rose, turned to Mara, and\r\nsaid, in prideful humility, "You have conquered. Let me go into the\r\nwilderness and bewail myself."\r\n\r\nMara saw that her submission was not feigned, neither was it real. She\r\nlooked at her a moment, and returned:\r\n\r\n"Begin, then, and set right in the place of wrong."\r\n\r\n"I know not how," she replied--with the look of one who foresaw and\r\nfeared the answer.\r\n\r\n"Open thy hand, and let that which is in it go."\r\n\r\nA fierce refusal seemed to struggle for passage, but she kept it\r\nprisoned.\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she said. "I have no longer the power. Open it for me."\r\n\r\nShe held out the offending hand. It was more a paw than a hand. It\r\nseemed to me plain that she could not open it.\r\n\r\nMara did not even look at it.\r\n\r\n"You must open it yourself," she said quietly.\r\n\r\n"I have told you I cannot!"\r\n\r\n"You can if you will--not indeed at once, but by persistent effort. What\r\nyou have done, you do not yet wish undone--do not yet intend to undo!"\r\n\r\n"You think so, I dare say," rejoined the princess with a flash of\r\ninsolence, "but I KNOW that I cannot open my hand!"\r\n\r\n"I know you better than you know yourself, and I know you can. You have\r\noften opened it a little way. Without trouble and pain you cannot open\r\nit quite, but you CAN open it. At worst you could beat it open! I pray\r\nyou, gather your strength, and open it wide."\r\n\r\n"I will not try what I know impossible. It would be the part of a fool!"\r\n\r\n"Which you have been playing all your life! Oh, you are hard to teach!"\r\n\r\nDefiance reappeared on the face of the princess. She turned her back on\r\nMara, saying, "I know what you have been tormenting me for! You have not\r\nsucceeded, nor shall you succeed! You shall yet find me stronger than\r\nyou think! I will yet be mistress of myself! I am still what I have\r\nalways known myself--queen of Hell, and mistress of the worlds!"\r\n\r\nThen came the most fearful thing of all. I did not know what it was; I\r\nknew myself unable to imagine it; I knew only that if it came near me I\r\nshould die of terror! I now know that it was LIFE IN DEATH--life dead,\r\nyet existent; and I knew that Lilith had had glimpses, but only glimpses\r\nof it before: it had never been with her until now.\r\n\r\nShe stood as she had turned. Mara went and sat down by the fire. Fearing\r\nto stand alone with the princess, I went also and sat again by the\r\nhearth. Something began to depart from me. A sense of cold, yet not what\r\nwe call cold, crept, not into, but out of my being, and pervaded it. The\r\nlamp of life and the eternal fire seemed dying together, and I about\r\nto be left with naught but the consciousness that I had been alive.\r\nMercifully, bereavement did not go so far, and my thought went back to\r\nLilith.\r\n\r\nSomething was taking place in her which we did not know. We knew we did\r\nnot feel what she felt, but we knew we felt something of the misery\r\nit caused her. The thing itself was in her, not in us; its reflex, her\r\nmisery, reached us, and was again reflected in us: she was in the outer\r\ndarkness, we present with her who was in it! We were not in the outer\r\ndarkness; had we been, we could not have been WITH her; we should have\r\nbeen timelessly, spacelessly, absolutely apart. The darkness knows\r\nneither the light nor itself; only the light knows itself and the\r\ndarkness also. None but God hates evil and understands it.\r\n\r\nSomething was gone from her, which then first, by its absence, she knew\r\nto have been with her every moment of her wicked years. The source of\r\nlife had withdrawn itself; all that was left her of conscious being was\r\nthe dregs of her dead and corrupted life.\r\n\r\nShe stood rigid. Mara buried her head in her hands. I gazed on the face\r\nof one who knew existence but not love--knew nor life, nor joy, nor\r\ngood; with my eyes I saw the face of a live death! She knew life only to\r\nknow that it was dead, and that, in her, death lived. It was not merely\r\nthat life had ceased in her, but that she was consciously a dead thing.\r\nShe had killed her life, and was dead--and knew it. She must DEATH IT\r\nfor ever and ever! She had tried her hardest to unmake herself, and\r\ncould not! she was a dead life! she could not cease! she must BE! In her\r\nface I saw and read beyond its misery--saw in its dismay that the dismay\r\nbehind it was more than it could manifest. It sent out a livid gloom;\r\nthe light that was in her was darkness, and after its kind it shone. She\r\nwas what God could not have created. She had usurped beyond her share\r\nin self-creation, and her part had undone His! She saw now what she had\r\nmade, and behold, it was not good! She was as a conscious corpse, whose\r\ncoffin would never come to pieces, never set her free! Her bodily eyes\r\nstood wide open, as if gazing into the heart of horror essential--her\r\nown indestructible evil. Her right hand also was now clenched--upon\r\nexistent Nothing--her inheritance!\r\n\r\nBut with God all things are possible: He can save even the rich!\r\n\r\nWithout change of look, without sign of purpose, Lilith walked toward\r\nMara. She felt her coming, and rose to meet her.\r\n\r\n"I yield," said the princess. "I cannot hold out. I am defeated.--Not\r\nthe less, I cannot open my hand."\r\n\r\n"Have you tried?"\r\n\r\n"I am trying now with all my might."\r\n\r\n"I will take you to my father. You have wronged him worst of the\r\ncreated, therefore he best of the created can help you."\r\n\r\n"How can HE help me?"\r\n\r\n"He will forgive you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if he would but help me to cease! Not even that am I capable of! I\r\nhave no power over myself; I am a slave! I acknowledge it. Let me die."\r\n\r\n"A slave thou art that shall one day be a child!" answered\r\nMara.--"Verily, thou shalt die, but not as thou thinkest. Thou shalt\r\ndie out of death into life. Now is the Life for, that never was against\r\nthee!"\r\n\r\nLike her mother, in whom lay the motherhood of all the world, Mara put\r\nher arms around Lilith, and kissed her on the forehead. The fiery-cold\r\nmisery went out of her eyes, and their fountains filled. She lifted, and\r\nbore her to her own bed in a corner of the room, laid her softly upon\r\nit, and closed her eyes with caressing hands.\r\n\r\nLilith lay and wept. The Lady of Sorrow went to the door and opened it.\r\n\r\nMorn, with the Spring in her arms, waited outside. Softly they stole in\r\nat the opened door, with a gentle wind in the skirts of their garments.\r\nIt flowed and flowed about Lilith, rippling the unknown, upwaking sea of\r\nher life eternal; rippling and to ripple it, until at length she who had\r\nbeen but as a weed cast on the dry sandy shore to wither, should know\r\nherself an inlet of the everlasting ocean, henceforth to flow into her\r\nfor ever, and ebb no more. She answered the morning wind with reviving\r\nbreath, and began to listen. For in the skirts of the wind had come\r\nthe rain--the soft rain that heals the mown, the many-wounded\r\ngrass--soothing it with the sweetness of all music, the hush that lives\r\nbetween music and silence. It bedewed the desert places around the\r\ncottage, and the sands of Lilith\'s heart heard it, and drank it in. When\r\nMara returned to sit by her bed, her tears were flowing softer than the\r\nrain, and soon she was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. THE HOUSE OF DEATH\r\n\r\nThe Mother of Sorrows rose, muffled her face, and went to call the\r\nLittle Ones. They slept as if all the night they had not moved, but\r\nthe moment she spoke they sprang to their feet, fresh as if new-made.\r\nMerrily down the stair they followed her, and she brought them where the\r\nprincess lay, her tears yet flowing as she slept. Their glad faces grew\r\ngrave. They looked from the princess out on the rain, then back at the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\n"The sky is falling!" said one.\r\n\r\n"The white juice is running out of the princess!" cried another, with an\r\nawed look.\r\n\r\n"Is it rivers?" asked Odu, gazing at the little streams that flowed\r\nadown her hollow cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Mara, "--the most wonderful of all rivers."\r\n\r\n"I thought rivers was bigger, and rushed, like a lot of Little Ones,\r\nmaking loud noises!" he returned, looking at me, from whom alone he had\r\nheard of rivers.\r\n\r\n"Look at the rivers of the sky!" said Mara. "See how they come down\r\nto wake up the waters under the earth! Soon will the rivers be flowing\r\neverywhere, merry and loud, like thousands and thousands of happy\r\nchildren. Oh, how glad they will make you, Little Ones! You have never\r\nseen any, and do not know how lovely is the water!"\r\n\r\n"That will be the glad of the ground that the princess is grown good,"\r\nsaid Odu. "See the glad of the sky!"\r\n\r\n"Are the rivers the glad of the princess?" asked Luva. "They are not her\r\njuice, for they are not red!"\r\n\r\n"They are the juice inside the juice," answered Mara.\r\n\r\nOdu put one finger to his eye, looked at it, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Princess will not bite now!" said Luva.\r\n\r\n"No; she will never do that again," replied Mara. "--But now we must\r\ntake her nearer home."\r\n\r\n"Is that a nest?" asked Sozo.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a very big nest. But we must take her to another place first."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"It is the biggest room in all this world.--But I think it is going to\r\nbe pulled down: it will soon be too full of little nests.--Go and get\r\nyour clumsies."\r\n\r\n"Please are there any cats in it?"\r\n\r\n"Not one. The nests are too full of lovely dreams for one cat to get\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"We shall be ready in a minute," said Odu, and ran out, followed by all\r\nexcept Luva.\r\n\r\nLilith was now awake, and listening with a sad smile.\r\n\r\n"But her rivers are running so fast!" said Luva, who stood by her side\r\nand seemed unable to take her eyes from her face. "Her robe is all--I\r\ndon\'t know what. Clumsies won\'t like it!"\r\n\r\n"They won\'t mind it," answered Mara. "Those rivers are so clean that\r\nthey make the whole world clean."\r\n\r\nI had fallen asleep by the fire, but for some time had been awake and\r\nlistening, and now rose.\r\n\r\n"It is time to mount, Mr. Vane," said our hostess.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, please," I said, "is there not a way by which to avoid the\r\nchannels and the den of monsters?"\r\n\r\n"There is an easy way across the river-bed, which I will show you," she\r\nanswered; "but you must pass once more through the monsters."\r\n\r\n"I fear for the children," I said.\r\n\r\n"Fear will not once come nigh them," she rejoined.\r\n\r\nWe left the cottage. The beasts stood waiting about the door. Odu was\r\nalready on the neck of one of the two that were to carry the princess. I\r\nmounted Lona\'s horse; Mara brought her body, and gave it me in my arms.\r\nWhen she came out again with the princess, a cry of delight arose from\r\nthe children: she was no longer muffled! Gazing at her, and entranced\r\nwith her loveliness, the boys forgot to receive the princess from her;\r\nbut the elephants took Lilith tenderly with their trunks, one round her\r\nbody and one round her knees, and, Mara helping, laid her along between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Why does the princess want to go?" asked a small boy. "She would keep\r\ngood if she staid here!"\r\n\r\n"She wants to go, and she does not want to go: we are helping her,"\r\nanswered Mara. "She will not keep good here."\r\n\r\n"What are you helping her to do?" he went on.\r\n\r\n"To go where she will get more help--help to open her hand, which has\r\nbeen closed for a thousand years."\r\n\r\n"So long? Then she has learned to do without it: why should she open it\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is shut upon something that is not hers."\r\n\r\n"Please, lady Mara, may we have some of your very dry bread before we\r\ngo?" said Luva.\r\n\r\nMara smiled, and brought them four loaves and a great jug of water.\r\n\r\n"We will eat as we go," they said. But they drank the water with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n"I think," remarked one of them, "it must be elephant-juice! It makes me\r\nso strong!"\r\n\r\nWe set out, the Lady of Sorrow walking with us, more beautiful than the\r\nsun, and the white leopardess following her. I thought she meant but to\r\nput us in the path across the channels, but I soon found she was going\r\nwith us all the way. Then I would have dismounted that she might ride,\r\nbut she would not let me.\r\n\r\n"I have no burden to carry," she said. "The children and I will walk\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nIt was the loveliest of mornings; the sun shone his brightest, and the\r\nwind blew his sweetest, but they did not comfort the desert, for it had\r\nno water.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the channels without difficulty, the children gamboling about\r\nMara all the way, but did not reach the top of the ridge over the bad\r\nburrow until the sun was already in the act of disappearing. Then I made\r\nthe Little Ones mount their elephants, for the moon might be late, and I\r\ncould not help some anxiety about them.\r\n\r\nThe Lady of Sorrow now led the way by my side; the elephants\r\nfollowed--the two that bore the princess in the centre; the leopardess\r\nbrought up the rear; and just as we reached the frightful margin, the\r\nmoon looked up and showed the shallow basin lying before us untroubled.\r\nMara stepped into it; not a movement answered her tread or the feet\r\nof my horse. But the moment that the elephants carrying the princess\r\ntouched it, the seemingly solid earth began to heave and boil, and the\r\nwhole dread brood of the hellish nest was commoved. Monsters uprose on\r\nall sides, every neck at full length, every beak and claw outstretched,\r\nevery mouth agape. Long-billed heads, horribly jawed faces, knotty\r\ntentacles innumerable, went out after Lilith. She lay in an agony of\r\nfear, nor dared stir a finger. Whether the hideous things even saw the\r\nchildren, I doubt; certainly not one of them touched a child; not one\r\nloathly member passed the live rampart of her body-guard, to lay hold of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Little Ones," I cried, "keep your elephants close about the princess.\r\nBe brave; they will not touch you."\r\n\r\n"What will not touch us? We don\'t know what to be brave at!" they\r\nanswered; and I perceived they were unaware of one of the deformities\r\naround them.\r\n\r\n"Never mind then," I returned; "only keep close."\r\n\r\nThey were panoplied in their blindness! Incapacity to see was their\r\nsafety. What they could nowise be aware of, could not hurt them.\r\n\r\nBut the hideous forms I saw that night! Mara was a few paces in front\r\nof me when a solitary, bodiless head bounced on the path between us. The\r\nleopardess came rushing under the elephants from behind, and would have\r\nseized it, but, with frightful contortions of visage and a loathsome\r\nhowl, it gave itself a rapid rotatory twist, sprang from her, and buried\r\nitself in the ground. The death in my arms assoiling me from fear, I\r\nregarded them all unmoved, although never, sure, was elsewhere beheld\r\nsuch a crew accursed!\r\n\r\nMara still went in front of me, and the leopardess now walked close\r\nbehind her, shivering often, for it was very cold, when suddenly the\r\nground before me to my left began to heave, and a low wave of earth came\r\nslinking toward us. It rose higher as it drew hear; out of it slouched\r\na dreadful head with fleshy tubes for hair, and opening a great oval\r\nmouth, snapped at me. The leopardess sprang, but fell baffled beyond it.\r\n\r\nAlmost under our feet, shot up the head of an enormous snake, with a\r\nlamping wallowing glare in its eyes. Again the leopardess rushed to the\r\nattack, but found nothing. At a third monster she darted with like fury,\r\nand like failure--then sullenly ceased to heed the phantom-horde. But I\r\nunderstood the peril and hastened the crossing--the rather that the moon\r\nwas carrying herself strangely. Even as she rose she seemed ready to\r\ndrop and give up the attempt as hopeless; and since, I saw her sink back\r\nonce fully her own breadth. The arc she made was very low, and now she\r\nhad begun to descend rapidly.\r\n\r\nWe were almost over, when, between us and the border of the basin, arose\r\na long neck, on the top of which, like the blossom of some Stygian lily,\r\nsat what seemed the head of a corpse, its mouth half open, and full of\r\ncanine teeth. I went on; it retreated, then drew aside. The lady stepped\r\non the firm land, but the leopardess between us, roused once more,\r\nturned, and flew at the throat of the terror. I remained where I was to\r\nsee the elephants, with the princess and the children, safe on the bank.\r\nThen I turned to look after the leopardess. That moment the moon\r\nwent down, For an instant I saw the leopardess and the snake-monster\r\nconvolved in a cloud of dust; then darkness hid them. Trembling with\r\nfright, my horse wheeled, and in three bounds overtook the elephants.\r\n\r\nAs we came up with them, a shapeless jelly dropped on the princess. A\r\nwhite dove dropped immediately on the jelly, stabbing it with its beak.\r\nIt made a squelching, sucking sound, and fell off. Then I heard the\r\nvoice of a woman talking with Mara, and I knew the voice.\r\n\r\n"I fear she is dead!" said Mara.\r\n\r\n"I will send and find her," answered the mother. "But why, Mara,\r\nshouldst thou at all fear for her or for any one? Death cannot hurt her\r\nwho dies doing the work given her to do."\r\n\r\n"I shall miss her sorely; she is good and wise. Yet I would not have her\r\nlive beyond her hour!"\r\n\r\n"She has gone down with the wicked; she will rise with the righteous. We\r\nshall see her again ere very long."\r\n\r\n"Mother," I said, although I did not see her, "we come to you many, but\r\nmost of us are Little Ones. Will you be able to receive us all?"\r\n\r\n"You are welcome every one," she answered. "Sooner or later all will be\r\nlittle ones, for all must sleep in my house! It is well with those that\r\ngo to sleep young and willing!--My husband is even now preparing her\r\ncouch for Lilith. She is neither young nor quite willing, but it is well\r\nindeed that she is come."\r\n\r\nI heard no more. Mother and daughter had gone away together through\r\nthe dark. But we saw a light in the distance, and toward it we went\r\nstumbling over the moor.\r\n\r\nAdam stood in the door, holding the candle to guide us, and talking with\r\nhis wife, who, behind him, laid bread and wine on the table within.\r\n\r\n"Happy children," I heard her say, "to have looked already on the face\r\nof my daughter! Surely it is the loveliest in the great world!"\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the door, Adam welcomed us almost merrily. He set the\r\ncandle on the threshold, and going to the elephants, would have taken\r\nthe princess to carry her in; but she repulsed him, and pushing her\r\nelephants asunder, stood erect between them. They walked from beside\r\nher, and left her with him who had been her husband--ashamed indeed of\r\nher gaunt uncomeliness, but unsubmissive. He stood with a welcome in his\r\neyes that shone through their severity.\r\n\r\n"We have long waited for thee, Lilith!" he said.\r\n\r\nShe returned him no answer.\r\n\r\nEve and her daughter came to the door.\r\n\r\n"The mortal foe of my children!" murmured Eve, standing radiant in her\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n"Your children are no longer in her danger," said Mara; "she has turned\r\nfrom evil."\r\n\r\n"Trust her not hastily, Mara," answered her mother; "she has deceived a\r\nmultitude!"\r\n\r\n"But you will open to her the mirror of the Law of Liberty, mother, that\r\nshe may go into it, and abide in it! She consents to open her hand and\r\nrestore: will not the great Father restore her to inheritance with His\r\nother children?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know Him!" murmured Lilith, in a voice of fear and doubt.\r\n\r\n"Therefore it is that thou art miserable," said Adam.\r\n\r\n"I will go back whence I came!" she cried, and turned, wringing her\r\nhands, to depart.\r\n\r\n"That is indeed what I would have thee do, where I would have thee\r\ngo--to Him from whom thou camest! In thy agony didst thou not cry out\r\nfor Him?"\r\n\r\n"I cried out for Death--to escape Him and thee!"\r\n\r\n"Death is even now on his way to lead thee to Him. Thou knowest neither\r\nDeath nor the Life that dwells in Death! Both befriend thee. I am dead,\r\nand would see thee dead, for I live and love thee. Thou art weary and\r\nheavy-laden: art thou not ashamed? Is not the being thou hast corrupted\r\nbecome to thee at length an evil thing? Wouldst thou yet live on in\r\ndisgrace eternal? Cease thou canst not: wilt thou not be restored and\r\nBE?"\r\n\r\nShe stood silent with bowed head.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Mara, "take her in thine arms, and carry her to her\r\ncouch. There she will open her hand, and die into life."\r\n\r\n"I will walk," said the princess.\r\n\r\nAdam turned and led the way. The princess walked feebly after him into\r\nthe cottage.\r\n\r\nThen Eve came out to me where I sat with Lona in my bosom. She reached\r\nup her arms, took her from me, and carried her in. I dismounted, and the\r\nchildren also. The horse and the elephants stood shivering; Mara patted\r\nand stroked them every one; they lay down and fell asleep. She led us\r\ninto the cottage, and gave the Little Ones of the bread and wine on the\r\ntable. Adam and Lilith were standing there together, but silent both.\r\n\r\nEve came from the chamber of death, where she had laid Lona down, and\r\noffered of the bread and wine to the princess.\r\n\r\n"Thy beauty slays me! It is death I would have, not food!" said Lilith,\r\nand turned from her.\r\n\r\n"This food will help thee to die," answered Eve.\r\n\r\nBut Lilith would not taste of it.\r\n\r\n"If thou wilt nor eat nor drink, Lilith," said Adam, "come and see the\r\nplace where thou shalt lie in peace."\r\n\r\nHe led the way through the door of death, and she followed submissive.\r\nBut when her foot crossed the threshold she drew it back, and pressed\r\nher hand to her bosom, struck through with the cold immortal.\r\n\r\nA wild blast fell roaring on the roof, and died away in a moan. She\r\nstood ghastly with terror.\r\n\r\n"It is he!" said her voiceless lips: I read their motion.\r\n\r\n"Who, princess!" I whispered.\r\n\r\n"The great Shadow," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Here he cannot enter," said Adam. "Here he can hurt no one. Over him\r\nalso is power given me."\r\n\r\n"Are the children in the house?" asked Lilith, and at the word the heart\r\nof Eve began to love her.\r\n\r\n"He never dared touch a child," she said. "Nor have you either ever hurt\r\na child. Your own daughter you have but sent into the loveliest sleep,\r\nfor she was already a long time dead when you slew her. And now Death\r\nshall be the atonemaker; you shall sleep together."\r\n\r\n"Wife," said Adam, "let us first put the children to bed, that she may\r\nsee them safe!"\r\n\r\nHe came back to fetch them. As soon as he was gone, the princess knelt\r\nto Eve, clasped her knees, and said,\r\n\r\n"Beautiful Eve, persuade your husband to kill me: to you he will listen!\r\nIndeed I would but cannot open my hand."\r\n\r\n"You cannot die without opening it. To kill you would not serve you,"\r\nanswered Eve. "But indeed he cannot! no one can kill you but the Shadow;\r\nand whom he kills never knows she is dead, but lives to do his will, and\r\nthinks she is doing her own."\r\n\r\n"Show me then to my grave; I am so weary I can live no longer. I must go\r\nto the Shadow--yet I would not!"\r\n\r\nShe did not, could not understand!\r\n\r\nShe struggled to rise, but fell at the feet of Eve. The Mother lifted,\r\nand carried her inward.\r\n\r\nI followed Adam and Mara and the children into the chamber of death. We\r\npassed Eve with Lilith in her arms, and went farther in.\r\n\r\n"You shall not go to the Shadow," I heard Eve say, as we passed them.\r\n"Even now is his head under my heel!"\r\n\r\nThe dim light in Adam\'s hand glimmered on the sleeping faces, and as he\r\nwent on, the darkness closed over them. The very air seemed dead: was it\r\nbecause none of the sleepers breathed it? Profoundest sleep filled the\r\nwide place. It was as if not one had waked since last I was there, for\r\nthe forms I had then noted lay there still. My father was just as I had\r\nleft him, save that he seemed yet nearer to a perfect peace. The woman\r\nbeside him looked younger.\r\n\r\nThe darkness, the cold, the silence, the still air, the faces of the\r\nlovely dead, made the hearts of the children beat softly, but their\r\nlittle tongues would talk--with low, hushed voices.\r\n\r\n"What a curious place to sleep in!" said one, "I would rather be in my\r\nnest!" "It is SO cold!" said another.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is cold," answered our host; "but you will not be cold in your\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"Where are our nests?" asked more than one, looking round and seeing no\r\ncouch unoccupied.\r\n\r\n"Find places, and sleep where you choose," replied Adam.\r\n\r\nInstantly they scattered, advancing fearlessly beyond the light, but we\r\nstill heard their gentle voices, and it was plain they saw where I could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried one, "here is such a beautiful lady!--may I sleep beside\r\nher? I will creep in quietly, and not wake her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you may," answered the voice of Eve behind us; and we came to the\r\ncouch while the little fellow was yet creeping slowly and softly under\r\nthe sheet. He laid his head beside the lady\'s, looked up at us, and was\r\nstill. His eyelids fell; he was asleep.\r\n\r\nWe went a little farther, and there was another who had climbed up on\r\nthe couch of a woman.\r\n\r\n"Mother! mother!" he cried, kneeling over her, his face close to hers.\r\n"--She\'s so cold she can\'t speak," he said, looking up to us; "but I\r\nwill soon make her warm!"\r\n\r\nHe lay down, and pressing close to her, put his little arm over her. In\r\nan instant he too was asleep, smiling an absolute content.\r\n\r\nWe came to a third Little One; it was Luva. She stood on tiptoe, leaning\r\nover the edge of a couch.\r\n\r\n"My own mother wouldn\'t have me," she said softly: "will you?"\r\n\r\nReceiving no reply, she looked up at Eve. The great mother lifted her to\r\nthe couch, and she got at once under the snowy covering.\r\n\r\nEach of the Little Ones had by this time, except three of the boys,\r\nfound at least an unobjecting bedfellow, and lay still and white beside\r\na still, white woman. The little orphans had adopted mothers! One tiny\r\ngirl had chosen a father to sleep with, and that was mine. A boy lay\r\nby the side of the beautiful matron with the slow-healing hand. On the\r\nmiddle one of the three couches hitherto unoccupied, lay Lona.\r\n\r\nEve set Lilith down beside it. Adam pointed to the vacant couch on\r\nLona\'s right hand, and said,\r\n\r\n"There, Lilith, is the bed I have prepared for you!"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at her daughter lying before her like a statue carved in\r\nsemi-transparent alabaster, and shuddered from head to foot. "How cold\r\nit is!" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"You will soon begin to find comfort in the cold," answered Adam.\r\n\r\n"Promises to the dying are easy!" she said.\r\n\r\n"But I know it: I too have slept. I am dead!"\r\n\r\n"I believed you dead long ago; but I see you alive!"\r\n\r\n"More alive than you know, or are able to understand. I was scarce alive\r\nwhen first you knew me. Now I have slept, and am awake; I am dead, and\r\nlive indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I fear that child," she said, pointing to Lona: "she will rise and\r\nterrify me!"\r\n\r\n"She is dreaming love to you."\r\n\r\n"But the Shadow!" she moaned; "I fear the Shadow! he will be wroth with\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n"He at sight of whom the horses of heaven start and rear, dares not\r\ndisturb one dream in this quiet chamber!"\r\n\r\n"I shall dream then?"\r\n\r\n"You will dream."\r\n\r\n"What dreams?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot tell, but none HE can enter into. When the Shadow comes\r\nhere, it will be to lie down and sleep also.--His hour will come, and he\r\nknows it will."\r\n\r\n"How long shall I sleep?"\r\n\r\n"You and he will be the last to wake in the morning of the universe."\r\n\r\nThe princess lay down, drew the sheet over her, stretched herself out\r\nstraight, and lay still with open eyes.\r\n\r\nAdam turned to his daughter. She drew near.\r\n\r\n"Lilith," said Mara, "you will not sleep, if you lie there a thousand\r\nyears, until you have opened your hand, and yielded that which is not\r\nyours to give or to withhold."\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she answered. "I would if I could, and gladly, for I am\r\nweary, and the shadows of death are gathering about me."\r\n\r\n"They will gather and gather, but they cannot infold you while yet your\r\nhand remains unopened. You may think you are dead, but it will be only\r\na dream; you may think you have come awake, but it will still be only a\r\ndream. Open your hand, and you will sleep indeed--then wake indeed."\r\n\r\n"I am trying hard, but the fingers have grown together and into the\r\npalm."\r\n\r\n"I pray you put forth the strength of your will. For the love of life,\r\ndraw together your forces and break its bonds!"\r\n\r\n"I have struggled in vain; I can do no more. I am very weary, and sleep\r\nlies heavy upon my lids."\r\n\r\n"The moment you open your hand, you will sleep. Open it, and make an\r\nend."\r\n\r\nA tinge of colour arose in the parchment-like face; the contorted hand\r\ntrembled with agonised effort. Mara took it, and sought to aid her.\r\n\r\n"Hold, Mara!" cried her father. "There is danger!"\r\n\r\nThe princess turned her eyes upon Eve, beseechingly.\r\n\r\n"There was a sword I once saw in your husband\'s hands," she murmured. "I\r\nfled when I saw it. I heard him who bore it say it would divide whatever\r\nwas not one and indivisible!"\r\n\r\n"I have the sword," said Adam. "The angel gave it me when he left the\r\ngate."\r\n\r\n"Bring it, Adam," pleaded Lilith, "and cut me off this hand that I may\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"I will," he answered.\r\n\r\nHe gave the candle to Eve, and went. The princess closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Adam returned with an ancient weapon in his hand. The\r\nscabbard looked like vellum grown dark with years, but the hilt shone\r\nlike gold that nothing could tarnish. He drew out the blade. It flashed\r\nlike a pale blue northern streamer, and the light of it made the\r\nprincess open her eyes. She saw the sword, shuddered, and held out her\r\nhand. Adam took it. The sword gleamed once, there was one little gush of\r\nblood, and he laid the severed hand in Mara\'s lap. Lilith had given one\r\nmoan, and was already fast asleep. Mara covered the arm with the sheet,\r\nand the three turned away.\r\n\r\n"Will you not dress the wound?" I said.\r\n\r\n"A wound from that sword," answered Adam, "needs no dressing. It is\r\nhealing and not hurt."\r\n\r\n"Poor lady!" I said, "she will wake with but one hand!"\r\n\r\n"Where the dead deformity clung," replied Mara, "the true, lovely hand\r\nis already growing."\r\n\r\nWe heard a childish voice behind us, and turned again. The candle in\r\nEve\'s hand shone on the sleeping face of Lilith, and the waking faces\r\nof the three Little Ones, grouped on the other side of her couch. "How\r\nbeautiful she is grown!" said one of them.\r\n\r\n"Poor princess!" said another; "I will sleep with her. She will not bite\r\nany more!"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he climbed into her bed, and was immediately fast asleep.\r\nEve covered him with the sheet.\r\n\r\n"I will go on her other side," said the third. "She shall have two to\r\nkiss her when she wakes!"\r\n\r\n"And I am left alone!" said the first mournfully.\r\n\r\n"I will put you to bed," said Eve.\r\n\r\nShe gave the candle to her husband, and led the child away.\r\n\r\nWe turned once more to go back to the cottage. I was very sad, for no\r\none had offered me a place in the house of the dead. Eve joined us as we\r\nwent, and walked on before with her husband. Mara by my side carried the\r\nhand of Lilith in the lap of her robe.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you have found her!" we heard Eve say as we stepped into the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nThe door stood open; two elephant-trunks came through it out of the\r\nnight beyond.\r\n\r\n"I sent them with the lantern," she went on to her husband, "to look for\r\nMara\'s leopardess: they have brought her."\r\n\r\nI followed Adam to the door, and between us we took the white creature\r\nfrom the elephants, and carried her to the chamber we had just left,\r\nthe women preceding us, Eve with the light, and Mara still carrying\r\nthe hand. There we laid the beauty across the feet of the princess, her\r\nfore-paws outstretched, and her head couching between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. I AM SENT\r\n\r\nThen I turned and said to Eve,\r\n\r\n"Mother, one couch next to Lona is empty: I know I am unworthy, but may\r\nI not sleep this night in your chamber with my dead? Will you not pardon\r\nboth my cowardice and my self-confidence, and take me in? I give me up.\r\nI am sick of myself, and would fain sleep the sleep!"\r\n\r\n"The couch next to Lona is the one already prepared for you," she\r\nanswered; "but something waits to be done ere you sleep."\r\n\r\n"I am ready," I replied.\r\n\r\n"How do you know you can do it?" she asked with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Because you require it," I answered. "What is it?"\r\n\r\nShe turned to Adam:\r\n\r\n"Is he forgiven, husband?"\r\n\r\n"From my heart."\r\n\r\n"Then tell him what he has to do."\r\n\r\nAdam turned to his daughter.\r\n\r\n"Give me that hand, Mara, my child."\r\n\r\nShe held it out to him in her lap. He took it tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Let us go to the cottage," he said to me; "there I will instruct you."\r\n\r\nAs we went, again arose a sudden stormful blast, mingled with a great\r\nflapping on the roof, but it died away as before in a deep moan.\r\n\r\nWhen the door of the death-chamber was closed behind us, Adam seated\r\nhimself, and I stood before him.\r\n\r\n"You will remember," he said, "how, after leaving my daughter\'s house,\r\nyou came to a dry rock, bearing the marks of an ancient cataract; you\r\nclimbed that rock, and found a sandy desert: go to that rock now, and\r\nfrom its summit walk deep into the desert. But go not many steps ere you\r\nlie down, and listen with your head on the sand. If you hear the murmur\r\nof water beneath, go a little farther, and listen again. If you still\r\nhear the sound, you are in the right direction. Every few yards you must\r\nstop, lie down, and hearken. If, listening thus, at any time you hear\r\nno sound of water, you are out of the way, and must hearken in every\r\ndirection until you hear it again. Keeping with the sound, and careful\r\nnot to retrace your steps, you will soon hear it louder, and the growing\r\nsound will lead you to where it is loudest: that is the spot you seek.\r\nThere dig with the spade I will give you, and dig until you come to\r\nmoisture: in it lay the hand, cover it to the level of the desert, and\r\ncome home.--But give good heed, and carry the hand with care. Never lay\r\nit down, in what place of seeming safety soever; let nothing touch it;\r\nstop nor turn aside for any attempt to bar your way; never look behind\r\nyou; speak to no one, answer no one, walk straight on.--It is yet dark,\r\nand the morning is far distant, but you must set out at once."\r\n\r\nHe gave me the hand, and brought me a spade.\r\n\r\n"This is my gardening spade," he said; "with it I have brought many a\r\nlovely thing to the sun."\r\n\r\nI took it, and went out into the night.\r\n\r\nIt was very cold, and pitch-dark. To fall would be a dread thing, and\r\nthe way I had to go was a difficult one even in the broad sunlight! But\r\nI had not set myself the task, and the minute I started I learned that I\r\nwas left to no chance: a pale light broke from the ground at every step,\r\nand showed me where next to set my foot. Through the heather and the low\r\nrocks I walked without once even stumbling. I found the bad burrow quite\r\nstill; not a wave arose, not a head appeared as I crossed it.\r\n\r\nA moon came, and herself showed me the easy way: toward morning I was\r\nalmost over the dry channels of the first branch of the river-bed, and\r\nnot far, I judged, from Mara\'s cottage.\r\n\r\nThe moon was very low, and the sun not yet up, when I saw before me in\r\nthe path, here narrowed by rocks, a figure covered from head to foot as\r\nwith a veil of moonlit mist. I kept on my way as if I saw nothing. The\r\nfigure threw aside its veil.\r\n\r\n"Have you forgotten me already?" said the princess--or what seemed she.\r\n\r\nI neither hesitated nor answered; I walked straight on.\r\n\r\n"You meant then to leave me in that horrible sepulchre! Do you not yet\r\nunderstand that where I please to be, there I am? Take my hand: I am\r\nalive as you!"\r\n\r\nI was on the point of saying, "Give me your left hand," but bethought\r\nmyself, held my peace, and steadily advanced.\r\n\r\n"Give me my hand," she suddenly shrieked, "or I will tear you in pieces:\r\nyou are mine!"\r\n\r\nShe flung herself upon me. I shuddered, but did not falter. Nothing\r\ntouched me, and I saw her no more.\r\n\r\nWith measured tread along the path, filling it for some distance, came a\r\nbody of armed men. I walked through them--nor know whether they gave way\r\nto me, or were bodiless things. But they turned and followed me; I heard\r\nand felt their march at my very heels; but I cast no look behind, and\r\nthe sound of their steps and the clash of their armour died away.\r\n\r\nA little farther on, the moon being now close to the horizon and the way\r\nin deep shadow, I descried, seated where the path was so narrow that I\r\ncould not pass her, a woman with muffled face.\r\n\r\n"Ah," she said, "you are come at last! I have waited here for you an\r\nhour or more! You have done well! Your trial is over. My father sent me\r\nto meet you that you might have a little rest on the way. Give me your\r\ncharge, and lay your head in my lap; I will take good care of both until\r\nthe sun is well risen. I am not bitterness always, neither to all men!"\r\n\r\nHer words were terrible with temptation, for I was very weary. And what\r\nmore likely to be true! If I were, through slavish obedience to the\r\nletter of the command and lack of pure insight, to trample under my\r\nfeet the very person of the Lady of Sorrow! My heart grew faint at the\r\nthought, then beat as if it would burst my bosom.\r\n\r\nNevertheless my will hardened itself against my heart, and my step did\r\nnot falter. I took my tongue between my teeth lest I should unawares\r\nanswer, and kept on my way. If Adam had sent her, he could not complain\r\nthat I would not heed her! Nor would the Lady of Sorrow love me the less\r\nthat even she had not been able to turn me aside!\r\n\r\nJust ere I reached the phantom, she pulled the covering from her face:\r\ngreat indeed was her loveliness, but those were not Mara\'s eyes! no lie\r\ncould truly or for long imitate them! I advanced as if the thing were\r\nnot there, and my foot found empty room.\r\n\r\nI had almost reached the other side when a Shadow--I think it was The\r\nShadow, barred my way. He seemed to have a helmet upon his head, but as\r\nI drew closer I perceived it was the head itself I saw--so distorted as\r\nto bear but a doubtful resemblance to the human. A cold wind smote me,\r\ndank and sickening--repulsive as the air of a charnel-house; firmness\r\nforsook my joints, and my limbs trembled as if they would drop in a\r\nhelpless heap. I seemed to pass through him, but I think now that he\r\npassed through me: for a moment I was as one of the damned. Then a soft\r\nwind like the first breath of a new-born spring greeted me, and before\r\nme arose the dawn.\r\n\r\nMy way now led me past the door of Mara\'s cottage. It stood wide open,\r\nand upon the table I saw a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water. In or\r\naround the cottage was neither howl nor wail.\r\n\r\nI came to the precipice that testified to the vanished river. I climbed\r\nits worn face, and went on into the desert. There at last, after much\r\nlistening to and fro, I determined the spot where the hidden water was\r\nloudest, hung Lilith\'s hand about my neck, and began to dig. It was a\r\nlong labour, for I had to make a large hole because of the looseness\r\nof the sand; but at length I threw up a damp spadeful. I flung the\r\nsexton-tool on the verge, and laid down the hand. A little water was\r\nalready oozing from under its fingers. I sprang out, and made haste to\r\nfill the grave. Then, utterly fatigued, I dropped beside it, and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII. I SLEEP THE SLEEP\r\n\r\nWhen I woke, the ground was moist about me, and my track to the grave\r\nwas growing a quicksand. In its ancient course the river was swelling,\r\nand had begun to shove at its burden. Soon it would be roaring down\r\nthe precipice, and, divided in its fall, rushing with one branch to\r\nresubmerge the orchard valley, with the other to drown perhaps the\r\nmonster horde, and between them to isle the Evil Wood. I set out at once\r\non my return to those who sent me.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the precipice, I took my way betwixt the branches, for I\r\nwould pass again by the cottage of Mara, lest she should have returned:\r\nI longed to see her once more ere I went to sleep; and now I knew where\r\nto cross the channels, even if the river should have overtaken me and\r\nfilled them. But when I reached it, the door stood open still; the bread\r\nand the water were still on the table; and deep silence was within and\r\naround it. I stopped and called aloud at the door, but no voice replied,\r\nand I went my way.\r\n\r\nA little farther, I came where sat a grayheaded man on the sand,\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\n"What ails you, sir?" I asked. "Are you forsaken?"\r\n\r\n"I weep," he answered, "because they will not let me die. I have been to\r\nthe house of death, and its mistress, notwithstanding my years, refuses\r\nme. Intercede for me, sir, if you know her, I pray you."\r\n\r\n"Nay, sir," I replied, "that I cannot; for she refuses none whom it is\r\nlawful for her to receive."\r\n\r\n"How know you this of her? You have never sought death! you are much too\r\nyoung to desire it!"\r\n\r\n"I fear your words may indicate that, were you young again, neither\r\nwould you desire it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, young sir, I would not! and certain I am that you cannot."\r\n\r\n"I may not be old enough to desire to die, but I am young enough to\r\ndesire to live indeed! Therefore I go now to learn if she will at length\r\ntake me in. You wish to die because you do not care to live: she will\r\nnot open her door to you, for no one can die who does not long to live."\r\n\r\n"It ill becomes your youth to mock a friendless old man. Pray, cease\r\nyour riddles!"\r\n\r\n"Did not then the Mother tell you something of the same sort?"\r\n\r\n"In truth I believe she did; but I gave little heed to her excuses."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then, sir," I rejoined, "it is but too plain you have not yet\r\nlearned to die, and I am heartily grieved for you. Such had I too been\r\nbut for the Lady of Sorrow. I am indeed young, but I have wept many\r\ntears; pardon me, therefore, if I presume to offer counsel:--Go to the\r\nLady of Sorrow, and \'take with both hands\'* what she will give you.\r\nYonder lies her cottage. She is not in it now, but her door stands open,\r\nand there is bread and water on her table. Go in; sit down; eat of the\r\nbread; drink of the water; and wait there until she appear. Then ask\r\ncounsel of her, for she is true, and her wisdom is great."\r\n\r\nHe fell to weeping afresh, and I left him weeping. What I said, I fear\r\nhe did not heed. But Mara would find him!\r\n\r\nThe sun was down, and the moon unrisen, when I reached the abode of the\r\nmonsters, but it was still as a stone till I passed over. Then I heard\r\na noise of many waters, and a great cry behind me, but I did not turn my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nEre I reached the house of death, the cold was bitter and the darkness\r\ndense; and the cold and the darkness were one, and entered into my bones\r\ntogether. But the candle of Eve, shining from the window, guided me, and\r\nkept both frost and murk from my heart.\r\n\r\nThe door stood open, and the cottage lay empty. I sat down disconsolate.\r\n\r\nAnd as I sat, there grew in me such a sense of loneliness as never yet\r\nin my wanderings had I felt. Thousands were near me, not one was with\r\nme! True, it was I who was dead, not they; but, whether by their life or\r\nby my death, we were divided! They were alive, but I was not dead enough\r\neven to know them alive: doubt WOULD come. They were, at best, far from\r\nme, and helpers I had none to lay me beside them!\r\n\r\nNever before had I known, or truly imagined desolation! In vain I took\r\nmyself to task, saying the solitude was but a seeming: I was awake, and\r\nthey slept--that was all! it was only that they lay so still and did not\r\nspeak! they were with me now, and soon, soon I should be with them!\r\n\r\nI dropped Adam\'s old spade, and the dull sound of its fall on the clay\r\nfloor seemed reverberated from the chamber beyond: a childish terror\r\nseized me; I sat and stared at the coffin-door.--But father Adam, mother\r\nEve, sister Mara would soon come to me, and then--welcome the cold world\r\nand the white neighbours! I forgot my fears, lived a little, and loved\r\nmy dead.\r\n\r\nSomething did move in the chamber of the dead! There came from it what\r\nwas LIKE a dim, far-off sound, yet was not what I knew as sound. My soul\r\nsprang into my ears. Was it a mere thrill of the dead air, too slight\r\nto be heard, but quivering in every spiritual sense? I KNEW without\r\nhearing, without feeling it!\r\n\r\nThe something was coming! it drew nearer! In the bosom of my\r\ndesertion awoke an infant hope. The noiseless thrill reached the\r\ncoffin-door--became sound, and smote on my ear.\r\n\r\nThe door began to move--with a low, soft creaking of its hinges. It was\r\nopening! I ceased to listen, and stared expectant.\r\n\r\nIt opened a little way, and a face came into the opening. It was Lona\'s.\r\nIts eyes were closed, but the face itself was upon me, and seemed to see\r\nme. It was white as Eve\'s, white as Mara\'s, but did not shine like their\r\nfaces. She spoke, and her voice was like a sleepy night-wind in the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n"Are you coming, king?" it said. "I cannot rest until you are with me,\r\ngliding down the river to the great sea, and the beautiful dream-land.\r\nThe sleepiness is full of lovely things: come and see them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my darling!" I cried. "Had I but known!--I thought you were dead!"\r\n\r\nShe lay on my bosom--cold as ice frozen to marble. She threw her arms,\r\nso white, feebly about me, and sighed--\r\n\r\n"Carry me back to my bed, king. I want to sleep."\r\n\r\nI bore her to the death-chamber, holding her tight lest she should\r\ndissolve out of my arms. Unaware that I saw, I carried her straight to\r\nher couch.\r\n\r\n"Lay me down," she said, "and cover me from the warm air; it hurts--a\r\nlittle. Your bed is there, next to mine. I shall see you when I wake."\r\n\r\nShe was already asleep. I threw myself on my couch--blessed as never was\r\nman on the eve of his wedding.\r\n\r\n"Come, sweet cold," I said, "and still my heart speedily."\r\n\r\nBut there came instead a glimmer of light in the chamber, and I saw the\r\nface of Adam approaching. He had not the candle, yet I saw him. At the\r\nside of Lona\'s couch, he looked down on her with a questioning smile,\r\nand then greeted me across it.\r\n\r\n"We have been to the top of the hill to hear the waters on their way,"\r\nhe said. "They will be in the den of the monsters to-night.--But why did\r\nyou not await our return?"\r\n\r\n"My child could not sleep," I answered.\r\n\r\n"She is fast asleep!" he rejoined.\r\n\r\n"Yes, now!" I said; "but she was awake when I laid her down."\r\n\r\n"She was asleep all the time!" he insisted. "She was perhaps dreaming\r\nabout you--and came to you?"\r\n\r\n"She did."\r\n\r\n"And did you not see that her eyes were closed?"\r\n\r\n"Now I think of it, I did."\r\n\r\n"If you had looked ere you laid her down, you would have seen her asleep\r\non the couch."\r\n\r\n"That would have been terrible!"\r\n\r\n"You would only have found that she was no longer in your arms."\r\n\r\n"That would have been worse!"\r\n\r\n"It is, perhaps, to think of; but to see it would not have troubled\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Dear father," I said, "how is it that I am not sleepy? I thought I\r\nshould go to sleep like the Little Ones the moment I laid my head down!"\r\n\r\n"Your hour is not quite come. You must have food ere you sleep."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I ought not to have lain down without your leave, for I cannot\r\nsleep without your help! I will get up at once!"\r\n\r\nBut I found my own weight more than I could move.\r\n\r\n"There is no need: we will serve you here," he answered. "--You do not\r\nfeel cold, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Not too cold to lie still, but perhaps too cold to eat!"\r\n\r\nHe came to the side of my couch, bent over me, and breathed on my heart.\r\nAt once I was warm.\r\n\r\nAs he left me, I heard a voice, and knew it was the Mother\'s. She was\r\nsinging, and her song was sweet and soft and low, and I thought she sat\r\nby my bed in the dark; but ere it ceased, her song soared aloft, and\r\nseemed to come from the throat of a woman-angel, high above all the\r\nregion of larks, higher than man had ever yet lifted up his heart. I\r\nheard every word she sang, but could keep only this:--\r\n\r\n     "Many a wrong, and its curing song;\r\n        Many a road, and many an inn;\r\n      Room to roam, but only one home\r\n        For all the world to win!"\r\n\r\nand I thought I had heard the song before.\r\n\r\nThen the three came to my couch together, bringing me bread and wine,\r\nand I sat up to partake of it. Adam stood on one side of me, Eve and\r\nMara on the other.\r\n\r\n"You are good indeed, father Adam, mother Eve, sister Mara," I said, "to\r\nreceive me! In my soul I am ashamed and sorry!"\r\n\r\n"We knew you would come again!" answered Eve.\r\n\r\n"How could you know it?" I returned.\r\n\r\n"Because here was I, born to look after my brothers and sisters!"\r\nanswered Mara with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Every creature must one night yield himself and lie down," answered\r\nAdam: "he was made for liberty, and must not be left a slave!"\r\n\r\n"It will be late, I fear, ere all have lain down!" I said.\r\n\r\n"There is no early or late here," he rejoined. "For him the true time\r\nthen first begins who lays himself down. Men are not coming home fast;\r\nwomen are coming faster. A desert, wide and dreary, parts him who lies\r\ndown to die from him who lies down to live. The former may well make\r\nhaste, but here is no haste."\r\n\r\n"To our eyes," said Eve, "you were coming all the time: we knew Mara\r\nwould find you, and you must come!"\r\n\r\n"How long is it since my father lay down?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I have told you that years are of no consequence in this house,"\r\nanswered Adam; "we do not heed them. Your father will wake when his\r\nmorning comes. Your mother, next to whom you are lying,----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, then, it IS my mother!" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes--she with the wounded hand," he assented; "--she will be up and\r\naway long ere your morning is ripe."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry."\r\n\r\n"Rather be glad."\r\n\r\n"It must be a sight for God Himself to see such a woman come awake!"\r\n\r\n"It is indeed a sight for God, a sight that makes her Maker glad! He\r\nsees of the travail of His soul, and is satisfied!--Look at her once\r\nmore, and sleep."\r\n\r\nHe let the rays of his candle fall on her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n"She looks much younger!" I said.\r\n\r\n"She IS much younger," he replied. "Even Lilith already begins to look\r\nyounger!"\r\n\r\nI lay down, blissfully drowsy.\r\n\r\n"But when you see your mother again," he continued, "you will not\r\nat first know her. She will go on steadily growing younger until she\r\nreaches the perfection of her womanhood--a splendour beyond foresight.\r\nThen she will open her eyes, behold on one side her husband, on the\r\nother her son--and rise and leave them to go to a father and a brother\r\nmore to her than they."\r\n\r\nI heard as one in a dream. I was very cold, but already the cold caused\r\nme no suffering. I felt them put on me the white garment of the dead.\r\nThen I forgot everything. The night about me was pale with sleeping\r\nfaces, but I was asleep also, nor knew that I slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII. THE DREAMS THAT CAME\r\n\r\nI grew aware of existence, aware also of the profound, the infinite\r\ncold. I was intensely blessed--more blessed, I know, than my heart,\r\nimagining, can now recall. I could not think of warmth with the least\r\nsuggestion of pleasure. I knew that I had enjoyed it, but could not\r\nremember how. The cold had soothed every care, dissolved every pain,\r\ncomforted every sorrow. COMFORTED? Nay; sorrow was swallowed up in the\r\nlife drawing nigh to restore every good and lovely thing a hundredfold!\r\nI lay at peace, full of the quietest expectation, breathing the damp\r\nodours of Earth\'s bountiful bosom, aware of the souls of primroses,\r\ndaisies and snowdrops, patiently waiting in it for the Spring.\r\n\r\nHow convey the delight of that frozen, yet conscious sleep! I had no\r\nmore to stand up! had only to lie stretched out and still! How cold I\r\nwas, words cannot tell; yet I grew colder and colder--and welcomed the\r\ncold yet more and more. I grew continuously less conscious of myself,\r\ncontinuously more conscious of bliss, unimaginable yet felt. I had\r\nneither made it nor prayed for it: it was mine in virtue of existence!\r\nand existence was mine in virtue of a Will that dwelt in mine.\r\n\r\nThen the dreams began to arrive--and came crowding.--I lay naked on a\r\nsnowy peak. The white mist heaved below me like a billowy sea. The cold\r\nmoon was in the air with me, and above the moon and me the colder sky,\r\nin which the moon and I dwelt. I was Adam, waiting for God to breathe\r\ninto my nostrils the breath of life.--I was not Adam, but a child in\r\nthe bosom of a mother white with a radiant whiteness. I was a youth on\r\na white horse, leaping from cloud to cloud of a blue heaven, hasting\r\ncalmly to some blessed goal. For centuries I dreamed--or was it\r\nchiliads? or only one long night?--But why ask? for time had nothing to\r\ndo with me; I was in the land of thought--farther in, higher up than the\r\nseven dimensions, the ten senses: I think I was where I am--in the heart\r\nof God.--I dreamed away dim cycles in the centre of a melting glacier,\r\nthe spectral moon drawing nearer and nearer, the wind and the welter\r\nof a torrent growing in my ears. I lay and heard them: the wind and\r\nthe water and the moon sang a peaceful waiting for a redemption drawing\r\nnigh. I dreamed cycles, I say, but, for aught I knew or can tell, they\r\nwere the solemn, aeonian march of a second, pregnant with eternity.\r\n\r\nThen, of a sudden, but not once troubling my conscious bliss, all the\r\nwrongs I had ever done, from far beyond my earthly memory down to the\r\npresent moment, were with me. Fully in every wrong lived the conscious\r\nI, confessing, abjuring, lamenting the dead, making atonement with each\r\nperson I had injured, hurt, or offended. Every human soul to which I had\r\ncaused a troubled thought, was now grown unspeakably dear to me, and I\r\nhumbled myself before it, agonising to cast from between us the clinging\r\noffence. I wept at the feet of the mother whose commands I had slighted;\r\nwith bitter shame I confessed to my father that I had told him two lies,\r\nand long forgotten them: now for long had remembered them, and kept them\r\nin memory to crush at last at his feet. I was the eager slave of all\r\nwhom I had thus or anyhow wronged. Countless services I devised to\r\nrender them! For this one I would build such a house as had never grown\r\nfrom the ground! for that one I would train such horses as had never yet\r\nbeen seen in any world! For a third I would make such a garden as had\r\nnever bloomed, haunted with still pools, and alive with running waters!\r\nI would write songs to make their hearts swell, and tales to make\r\nthem glow! I would turn the forces of the world into such channels of\r\ninvention as to make them laugh with the joy of wonder! Love possessed\r\nme! Love was my life! Love was to me, as to him that made me, all in\r\nall!\r\n\r\nSuddenly I found myself in a solid blackness, upon which the ghost of\r\nlight that dwells in the caverns of the eyes could not cast one fancied\r\nglimmer. But my heart, which feared nothing and hoped infinitely, was\r\nfull of peace. I lay imagining what the light would be when it came,\r\nand what new creation it would bring with it--when, suddenly, without\r\nconscious volition, I sat up and stared about me.\r\n\r\nThe moon was looking in at the lowest, horizontal, crypt-like windows\r\nof the death-chamber, her long light slanting, I thought, across\r\nthe fallen, but still ripening sheaves of the harvest of the great\r\nhusbandman.--But no; that harvest was gone! Gathered in, or swept away\r\nby chaotic storm, not a sacred sheaf was there! My dead were gone! I was\r\nalone!--In desolation dread lay depths yet deeper than I had hitherto\r\nknown!--Had there never been any ripening dead? Had I but dreamed them\r\nand their loveliness? Why then these walls? why the empty couches? No;\r\nthey were all up! they were all abroad in the new eternal day, and had\r\nforgotten me! They had left me behind, and alone! Tenfold more terrible\r\nwas the tomb its inhabitants away! The quiet ones had made me quiet with\r\ntheir presence--had pervaded my mind with their blissful peace; now I\r\nhad no friend, and my lovers were far from me! A moment I sat and stared\r\nhorror-stricken. I had been alone with the moon on a mountain top in the\r\nsky; now I was alone with her in a huge cenotaph: she too was staring\r\nabout, seeking her dead with ghastly gaze! I sprang to my feet, and\r\nstaggered from the fearful place.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was empty. I ran out into the night.\r\n\r\nNo moon was there! Even as I left the chamber, a cloudy rampart had\r\nrisen and covered her. But a broad shimmer came from far over the heath,\r\nmingled with a ghostly murmuring music, as if the moon were raining\r\na light that plashed as it fell. I ran stumbling across the moor, and\r\nfound a lovely lake, margined with reeds and rushes: the moon behind\r\nthe cloud was gazing upon the monsters\' den, full of clearest, brightest\r\nwater, and very still.--But the musical murmur went on, filling the\r\nquiet air, and drawing me after it.\r\n\r\nI walked round the border of the little mere, and climbed the range of\r\nhills. What a sight rose to my eyes! The whole expanse where, with hot,\r\naching feet, I had crossed and recrossed the deep-scored channels and\r\nravines of the dry river-bed, was alive with streams, with torrents,\r\nwith still pools--"a river deep and wide"! How the moon flashed on the\r\nwater! how the water answered the moon with flashes of its own--white\r\nflashes breaking everywhere from its rock-encountered flow! And a great\r\njubilant song arose from its bosom, the song of new-born liberty. I\r\nstood a moment gazing, and my heart also began to exult: my life was not\r\nall a failure! I had helped to set this river free!--My dead were not\r\nlost! I had but to go after and find them! I would follow and follow\r\nuntil I came whither they had gone! Our meeting might be thousands of\r\nyears away, but at last--AT LAST I should hold them! Wherefore else did\r\nthe floods clap their hands?\r\n\r\nI hurried down the hill: my pilgrimage was begun! In what direction to\r\nturn my steps I knew not, but I must go and go till I found my living\r\ndead! A torrent ran swift and wide at the foot of the range: I rushed\r\nin, it laid no hold upon me; I waded through it. The next I sprang\r\nacross; the third I swam; the next I waded again.\r\n\r\nI stopped to gaze on the wondrous loveliness of the ceaseless flash and\r\nflow, and to hearken to the multitudinous broken music. Every now and\r\nthen some incipient air would seem about to draw itself clear of the\r\ndulcet confusion, only to merge again in the consorted roar. At moments\r\nthe world of waters would invade as if to overwhelm me--not with the\r\nforce of its seaward rush, or the shouting of its liberated throng, but\r\nwith the greatness of the silence wandering into sound.\r\n\r\nAs I stood lost in delight, a hand was laid on my shoulder. I turned,\r\nand saw a man in the prime of strength, beautiful as if fresh from the\r\nheart of the glad creator, young like him who cannot grow old. I looked:\r\nit was Adam. He stood large and grand, clothed in a white robe, with the\r\nmoon in his hair.\r\n\r\n"Father," I cried, "where is she? Where are the dead? Is the great\r\nresurrection come and gone? The terror of my loneliness was upon me;\r\nI could not sleep without my dead; I ran from the desolate\r\nchamber.--Whither shall I go to find them?"\r\n\r\n"You mistake, my son," he answered, in a voice whose very breath was\r\nconsolation. "You are still in the chamber of death, still upon your\r\ncouch, asleep and dreaming, with the dead around you."\r\n\r\n"Alas! when I but dream how am I to know it? The dream best dreamed is\r\nthe likest to the waking truth!"\r\n\r\n"When you are quite dead, you will dream no false dream. The soul that\r\nis true can generate nothing that is not true, neither can the false\r\nenter it."\r\n\r\n"But, sir," I faltered, "how am I to distinguish betwixt the true and\r\nthe false where both alike seem real?"\r\n\r\n"Do you not understand?" he returned, with a smile that might have slain\r\nall the sorrows of all his children. "You CANNOT perfectly distinguish\r\nbetween the true and the false while you are not yet quite dead; neither\r\nindeed will you when you are quite dead--that is, quite alive, for then\r\nthe false will never present itself. At this moment, believe me, you are\r\non your bed in the house of death."\r\n\r\n"I am trying hard to believe you, father. I do indeed believe you,\r\nalthough I can neither see nor feel the truth of what you say."\r\n\r\n"You are not to blame that you cannot. And because even in a dream you\r\nbelieve me, I will help you.--Put forth your left hand open, and close\r\nit gently: it will clasp the hand of your Lona, who lies asleep where\r\nyou lie dreaming you are awake."\r\n\r\nI put forth my hand: it closed on the hand of Lona, firm and soft and\r\ndeathless.\r\n\r\n"But, father," I cried, "she is warm!"\r\n\r\n"Your hand is as warm to hers. Cold is a thing unknown in our country.\r\nNeither she nor you are yet in the fields of home, but each to each is\r\nalive and warm and healthful."\r\n\r\nThen my heart was glad. But immediately supervened a sharp-stinging\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n"Father," I said, "forgive me, but how am I to know surely that this\r\nalso is not a part of the lovely dream in which I am now walking with\r\nthyself?"\r\n\r\n"Thou doubtest because thou lovest the truth. Some would willingly\r\nbelieve life but a phantasm, if only it might for ever afford them a\r\nworld of pleasant dreams: thou art not of such! Be content for a while\r\nnot to know surely. The hour will come, and that ere long, when, being\r\ntrue, thou shalt behold the very truth, and doubt will be for ever dead.\r\nScarce, then, wilt thou be able to recall the features of the phantom.\r\nThou wilt then know that which thou canst not now dream. Thou hast\r\nnot yet looked the Truth in the face, hast as yet at best but seen him\r\nthrough a cloud. That which thou seest not, and never didst see save\r\nin a glass darkly--that which, indeed, never can be known save by its\r\ninnate splendour shining straight into pure eyes--that thou canst not\r\nbut doubt, and art blameless in doubting until thou seest it face to\r\nface, when thou wilt no longer be able to doubt it. But to him who has\r\nonce seen even a shadow only of the truth, and, even but hoping he has\r\nseen it when it is present no longer, tries to obey it--to him the real\r\nvision, the Truth himself, will come, and depart no more, but abide with\r\nhim for ever."\r\n\r\n"I think I see, father," I said; "I think I understand."\r\n\r\n"Then remember, and recall. Trials yet await thee, heavy, of a nature\r\nthou knowest not now. Remember the things thou hast seen. Truly thou\r\nknowest not those things, but thou knowest what they have seemed, what\r\nthey have meant to thee! Remember also the things thou shalt yet see.\r\nTruth is all in all; and the truth of things lies, at once hid and\r\nrevealed, in their seeming."\r\n\r\n"How can that be, father?" I said, and raised my eyes with the question;\r\nfor I had been listening with downbent head, aware of nothing but the\r\nvoice of Adam.\r\n\r\nHe was gone; in my ears was nought but the sounding silence of the\r\nswift-flowing waters. I stretched forth my hands to find him, but no\r\nanswering touch met their seeking. I was alone--alone in the land of\r\ndreams! To myself I seemed wide awake, but I believed I was in a dream,\r\nbecause he had told me so.\r\n\r\nEven in a dream, however, the dreamer must do something! he cannot sit\r\ndown and refuse to stir until the dream grow weary of him and depart: I\r\ntook up my wandering, and went on.\r\n\r\nMany channels I crossed, and came to a wider space of rock; there,\r\ndreaming I was weary, I laid myself down, and longed to be awake.\r\n\r\nI was about to rise and resume my journey, when I discovered that I lay\r\nbeside a pit in the rock, whose mouth was like that of a grave. It was\r\ndeep and dark; I could see no bottom.\r\n\r\nNow in the dreams of my childhood I had found that a fall invariably\r\nwoke me, and would, therefore, when desiring to discontinue a dream,\r\nseek some eminence whence to cast myself down that I might wake: with\r\none glance at the peaceful heavens, and one at the rushing waters, I\r\nrolled myself over the edge of the pit.\r\n\r\nFor a moment consciousness left me. When it returned, I stood in the\r\ngarret of my own house, in the little wooden chamber of the cowl and the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\nUnspeakable despair, hopelessness blank and dreary, invaded me with the\r\nknowledge: between me and my Lona lay an abyss impassable! stretched a\r\ndistance no chain could measure! Space and Time and Mode of Being, as\r\nwith walls of adamant unscalable, impenetrable, shut me in from that\r\ngulf! True, it might yet be in my power to pass again through the door\r\nof light, and journey back to the chamber of the dead; and if so, I was\r\nparted from that chamber only by a wide heath, and by the pale,\r\nstarry night betwixt me and the sun, which alone could open for me the\r\nmirror-door, and was now far away on the other side of the world! but an\r\nimmeasurably wider gulf sank between us in this--that she was asleep and\r\nI was awake! that I was no longer worthy to share with her that sleep,\r\nand could no longer hope to awake from it with her! For truly I was much\r\nto blame: I had fled from my dream! The dream was not of my making,\r\nany more than was my life: I ought to have seen it to the end! and in\r\nfleeing from it, I had left the holy sleep itself behind me!--I would go\r\nback to Adam, tell him the truth, and bow to his decree!\r\n\r\nI crept to my chamber, threw myself on my bed, and passed a dreamless\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI rose, and listlessly sought the library. On the way I met no one; the\r\nhouse seemed dead. I sat down with a book to await the noontide: not\r\na sentence could I understand! The mutilated manuscript offered itself\r\nfrom the masked door: the sight of it sickened me; what to me was the\r\nprincess with her devilry!\r\n\r\nI rose and looked out of a window. It was a brilliant morning. With a\r\ngreat rush the fountain shot high, and fell roaring back. The sun sat in\r\nits feathery top. Not a bird sang, not a creature was to be seen. Raven\r\nnor librarian came near me. The world was dead about me. I took another\r\nbook, sat down again, and went on waiting.\r\n\r\nNoon was near. I went up the stairs to the dumb, shadowy roof. I closed\r\nbehind me the door into the wooden chamber, and turned to open the door\r\nout of a dreary world.\r\n\r\nI left the chamber with a heart of stone. Do what I might, all was\r\nfruitless. I pulled the chains; adjusted and re-adjusted the hood;\r\narranged and re-arranged the mirrors; no result followed. I waited and\r\nwaited to give the vision time; it would not come; the mirror stood\r\nblank; nothing lay in its dim old depth but the mirror opposite and my\r\nhaggard face.\r\n\r\nI went back to the library. There the books were hateful to me--for I\r\nhad once loved them.\r\n\r\nThat night I lay awake from down-lying to uprising, and the next day\r\nrenewed my endeavours with the mystic door. But all was yet in vain. How\r\nthe hours went I cannot think. No one came nigh me; not a sound from the\r\nhouse below entered my ears. Not once did I feel weary--only desolate,\r\ndrearily desolate.\r\n\r\nI passed a second sleepless night. In the morning I went for the last\r\ntime to the chamber in the roof, and for the last time sought an open\r\ndoor: there was none. My heart died within me. I had lost my Lona!\r\n\r\nWas she anywhere? had she ever been, save in the mouldering cells of\r\nmy brain? "I must die one day," I thought, "and then, straight from my\r\ndeath-bed, I will set out to find her! If she is not, I will go to\r\nthe Father and say--\'Even thou canst not help me: let me cease, I pray\r\nthee!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV. THE WAKING\r\n\r\nThe fourth night I seemed to fall asleep, and that night woke indeed. I\r\nopened my eyes and knew, although all was dark around me, that I lay in\r\nthe house of death, and that every moment since there I fell asleep\r\nI had been dreaming, and now first was awake. "At last!" I said to my\r\nheart, and it leaped for joy. I turned my eyes; Lona stood by my couch,\r\nwaiting for me! I had never lost her!--only for a little time lost the\r\nsight of her! Truly I needed not have lamented her so sorely!\r\n\r\nIt was dark, as I say, but I saw her: SHE was not dark! Her eyes shone\r\nwith the radiance of the Mother\'s, and the same light issued from her\r\nface--nor from her face only, for her death-dress, filled with the light\r\nof her body now tenfold awake in the power of its resurrection, was\r\nwhite as snow and glistering. She fell asleep a girl; she awoke a woman,\r\nripe with the loveliness of the life essential. I folded her in my arms,\r\nand knew that I lived indeed.\r\n\r\n"I woke first!" she said, with a wondering smile.\r\n\r\n"You did, my love, and woke me!"\r\n\r\n"I only looked at you and waited," she answered.\r\n\r\nThe candle came floating toward us through the dark, and in a few\r\nmoments Adam and Eve and Mara were with us. They greeted us with a quiet\r\ngood-morning and a smile: they were used to such wakings!\r\n\r\n"I hope you have had a pleasant darkness!" said the Mother.\r\n\r\n"Not very," I answered, "but the waking from it is heavenly."\r\n\r\n"It is but begun," she rejoined; "you are hardly yet awake!"\r\n\r\n"He is at least clothed-upon with Death, which is the radiant garment of\r\nLife," said Adam.\r\n\r\nHe embraced Lona his child, put an arm around me, looked a moment or two\r\ninquiringly at the princess, and patted the head of the leopardess.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall meet you two again before long," he said, looking\r\nfirst at Lona, then at me.\r\n\r\n"Have we to die again?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No," he answered, with a smile like the Mother\'s; "you have died into\r\nlife, and will die no more; you have only to keep dead. Once dying as we\r\ndie here, all the dying is over. Now you have only to live, and that you\r\nmust, with all your blessed might. The more you live, the stronger you\r\nbecome to live."\r\n\r\n"But shall I not grow weary with living so strong?" I said. "What if I\r\ncease to live with all my might?"\r\n\r\n"It needs but the will, and the strength is there!" said the Mother.\r\n"Pure life has no weakness to grow weary withal. THE Life keeps\r\ngenerating ours.--Those who will not die, die many times, die\r\nconstantly, keep dying deeper, never have done dying; here all is\r\nupwardness and love and gladness."\r\n\r\nShe ceased with a smile and a look that seemed to say, "We are mother\r\nand son; we understand each other! Between us no farewell is possible."\r\n\r\nMara kissed me on the forehead, and said, gayly,\r\n\r\n"I told you, brother, all would be well!--When next you would comfort,\r\nsay, \'What will be well, is even now well.\'"\r\n\r\nShe gave a little sigh, and I thought it meant, "But they will not\r\nbelieve you!"\r\n\r\n"--You know me now!" she ended, with a smile like her mother\'s.\r\n\r\n"I know you!" I answered: "you are the voice that cried in the\r\nwilderness before ever the Baptist came! you are the shepherd whose\r\nwolves hunt the wandering sheep home ere the shadow rise and the night\r\ngrow dark!"\r\n\r\n"My work will one day be over," she said, "and then I shall be glad with\r\nthe gladness of the great shepherd who sent me."\r\n\r\n"All the night long the morning is at hand," said Adam.\r\n\r\n"What is that flapping of wings I hear?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The Shadow is hovering," replied Adam: "there is one here whom he\r\ncounts his own! But ours once, never more can she be his!"\r\n\r\nI turned to look on the faces of my father and mother, and kiss them ere\r\nwe went: their couches were empty save of the Little Ones who had with\r\nlove\'s boldness appropriated their hospitality! For an instant that\r\nawful dream of desolation overshadowed me, and I turned aside.\r\n\r\n"What is it, my heart?" said Lona.\r\n\r\n"Their empty places frightened me," I answered.\r\n\r\n"They are up and away long ago," said Adam. "They kissed you ere they\r\nwent, and whispered, \'Come soon.\'"\r\n\r\n"And I neither to feel nor hear them!" I murmured.\r\n\r\n"How could you--far away in your dreary old house! You thought the\r\ndreadful place had you once more! Now go and find them.--Your parents,\r\nmy child," he added, turning to Lona, "must come and find you!"\r\n\r\nThe hour of our departure was at hand. Lona went to the couch of the\r\nmother who had slain her, and kissed her tenderly--then laid herself in\r\nher father\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"That kiss will draw her homeward, my Lona!" said Adam.\r\n\r\n"Who were her parents?" asked Lona.\r\n\r\n"My father," answered Adam, "is her father also."\r\n\r\nShe turned and laid her hand in mine.\r\n\r\nI kneeled and humbly thanked the three for helping me to die. Lona knelt\r\nbeside me, and they all breathed upon us.\r\n\r\n"Hark! I hear the sun," said Adam.\r\n\r\nI listened: he was coming with the rush as of a thousand times ten\r\nthousand far-off wings, with the roar of a molten and flaming world\r\nmillions upon millions of miles away. His approach was a crescendo chord\r\nof a hundred harmonies.\r\n\r\nThe three looked at each other and smiled, and that smile went floating\r\nheavenward a three-petaled flower, the family\'s morning thanksgiving.\r\nFrom their mouths and their faces it spread over their bodies and shone\r\nthrough their garments. Ere I could say, "Lo, they change!" Adam and\r\nEve stood before me the angels of the resurrection, and Mara was the\r\nMagdalene with them at the sepulchre. The countenance of Adam was like\r\nlightning, and Eve held a napkin that flung flakes of splendour about\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nA wind began to moan in pulsing gusts.\r\n\r\n"You hear his wings now!" said Adam; and I knew he did not mean the\r\nwings of the morning.\r\n\r\n"It is the great Shadow stirring to depart," he went on. "Wretched\r\ncreature, he has himself within him, and cannot rest!"\r\n\r\n"But is there not in him something deeper yet?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Without a substance," he answered, "a shadow cannot be--yea, or without\r\na light behind the substance!"\r\n\r\nHe listened for a moment, then called out, with a glad smile, "Hark\r\nto the golden cock! Silent and motionless for millions of years has\r\nhe stood on the clock of the universe; now at last he is flapping his\r\nwings! now will he begin to crow! and at intervals will men hear him\r\nuntil the dawn of the day eternal."\r\n\r\nI listened. Far away--as in the heart of an aeonian silence, I heard the\r\nclear jubilant outcry of the golden throat. It hurled defiance at\r\ndeath and the dark; sang infinite hope, and coming calm. It was the\r\n"expectation of the creature" finding at last a voice; the cry of a\r\nchaos that would be a kingdom!\r\n\r\nThen I heard a great flapping.\r\n\r\n"The black bat is flown!" said Mara.\r\n\r\n"Amen, golden cock, bird of God!" cried Adam, and the words rang through\r\nthe house of silence, and went up into the airy regions.\r\n\r\nAt his AMEN--like doves arising on wings of silver from among the\r\npotsherds, up sprang the Little Ones to their knees on their beds,\r\ncalling aloud,\r\n\r\n"Crow! crow again, golden cock!"--as if they had both seen and heard him\r\nin their dreams.\r\n\r\nThen each turned and looked at the sleeping bedfellow, gazed a moment\r\nwith loving eyes, kissed the silent companion of the night, and sprang\r\nfrom the couch. The Little Ones who had lain down beside my father and\r\nmother gazed blank and sad for a moment at their empty places, then slid\r\nslowly to the floor. There they fell each into the other\'s arms, as if\r\nthen first, each by the other\'s eyes, assured they were alive and awake.\r\nSuddenly spying Lona, they came running, radiant with bliss, to embrace\r\nher. Odu, catching sight of the leopardess on the feet of the princess,\r\nbounded to her next, and throwing an arm over the great sleeping head,\r\nfondled and kissed it.\r\n\r\n"Wake up, wake up, darling!" he cried; "it is time to wake!"\r\n\r\nThe leopardess did not move.\r\n\r\n"She has slept herself cold!" he said to Mara, with an upcast look of\r\nappealing consternation.\r\n\r\n"She is waiting for the princess to wake, my child," said Mara.\r\n\r\nOdu looked at the princess, and saw beside her, still asleep, two of his\r\ncompanions. He flew at them.\r\n\r\n"Wake up! wake up!" he cried, and pushed and pulled, now this one, now\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBut soon he began to look troubled, and turned to me with misty eyes.\r\n\r\n"They will not wake!" he said. "And why are they so cold?"\r\n\r\n"They too are waiting for the princess," I answered.\r\n\r\nHe stretched across, and laid his hand on her face.\r\n\r\n"She is cold too! What is it?" he cried--and looked round in wondering\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nAdam went to him.\r\n\r\n"Her wake is not ripe yet," he said: "she is busy forgetting. When she\r\nhas forgotten enough to remember enough, then she will soon be ripe, and\r\nwake."\r\n\r\n"And remember?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--but not too much at once though."\r\n\r\n"But the golden cock has crown!" argued the child, and fell again upon\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\n"Peter! Peter! Crispy!" he cried. "Wake up, Peter! wake up, Crispy! We\r\nare all awake but you two! The gold cock has crown SO loud! The sun is\r\nawake and coming! Oh, why WON\'T you wake?"\r\n\r\nBut Peter would not wake, neither would Crispy, and Odu wept outright at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"Let them sleep, darling!" said Adam. "You would not like the princess\r\nto wake and find nobody? They are quite happy. So is the leopardess."\r\n\r\nHe was comforted, and wiped his eyes as if he had been all his life\r\nused to weeping and wiping, though now first he had tears wherewith to\r\nweep--soon to be wiped altogether away.\r\n\r\nWe followed Eve to the cottage. There she offered us neither bread nor\r\nwine, but stood radiantly desiring our departure. So, with never a word\r\nof farewell, we went out. The horse and the elephants were at the door,\r\nwaiting for us. We were too happy to mount them, and they followed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV. THE JOURNEY HOME\r\n\r\nIt had ceased to be dark; we walked in a dim twilight, breathing through\r\nthe dimness the breath of the spring. A wondrous change had passed upon\r\nthe world--or was it not rather that a change more marvellous had\r\ntaken place in us? Without light enough in the sky or the air to reveal\r\nanything, every heather-bush, every small shrub, every blade of grass\r\nwas perfectly visible--either by light that went out from it, as fire\r\nfrom the bush Moses saw in the desert, or by light that went out of our\r\neyes. Nothing cast a shadow; all things interchanged a little light.\r\nEvery growing thing showed me, by its shape and colour, its indwelling\r\nidea--the informing thought, that is, which was its being, and sent it\r\nout. My bare feet seemed to love every plant they trod upon. The world\r\nand my being, its life and mine, were one. The microcosm and macrocosm\r\nwere at length atoned, at length in harmony! I lived in everything;\r\neverything entered and lived in me. To be aware of a thing, was to know\r\nits life at once and mine, to know whence we came, and where we were at\r\nhome--was to know that we are all what we are, because Another is what\r\nhe is! Sense after sense, hitherto asleep, awoke in me--sense after\r\nsense indescribable, because no correspondent words, no likenesses or\r\nimaginations exist, wherewithal to describe them. Full indeed--yet ever\r\nexpanding, ever making room to receive--was the conscious being where\r\nthings kept entering by so many open doors! When a little breeze\r\nbrushing a bush of heather set its purple bells a ringing, I was myself\r\nin the joy of the bells, myself in the joy of the breeze to which\r\nresponded their sweet TIN-TINNING**, myself in the joy of the sense, and\r\nof the soul that received all the joys together. To everything glad I\r\nlent the hall of my being wherein to revel. I was a peaceful ocean\r\nupon which the ground-swell of a living joy was continually lifting new\r\nwaves; yet was the joy ever the same joy, the eternal joy, with tens of\r\nthousands of changing forms. Life was a cosmic holiday.\r\n\r\nNow I knew that life and truth were one; that life mere and pure is\r\nin itself bliss; that where being is not bliss, it is not life, but\r\nlife-in-death. Every inspiration of the dark wind that blew where it\r\nlisted, went out a sigh of thanksgiving. At last I was! I lived, and\r\nnothing could touch my life! My darling walked beside me, and we were on\r\nour way home to the Father!\r\n\r\nSo much was ours ere ever the first sun rose upon our freedom: what must\r\nnot the eternal day bring with it!\r\n\r\nWe came to the fearful hollow where once had wallowed the monsters of\r\nthe earth: it was indeed, as I had beheld it in my dream, a lovely lake.\r\nI gazed into its pellucid depths. A whirlpool had swept out the soil in\r\nwhich the abortions burrowed, and at the bottom lay visible the whole\r\nhorrid brood: a dim greenish light pervaded the crystalline water, and\r\nrevealed every hideous form beneath it. Coiled in spires, folded in\r\nlayers, knotted on themselves, or "extended long and large," they\r\nweltered in motionless heaps--shapes more fantastic in ghoulish,\r\nblasting dismay, than ever wine-sodden brain of exhausted poet fevered\r\ninto misbeing. He who dived in the swirling Maelstrom saw none to\r\ncompare with them in horror: tentacular convolutions, tumid bulges,\r\nglaring orbs of sepian deformity, would have looked to him innocence\r\nbeside such incarnations of hatefulness--every head the wicked\r\nflower that, bursting from an abominable stalk, perfected its evil\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nNot one of them moved as we passed. But they were not dead. So long as\r\nexist men and women of unwholesome mind, that lake will still be peopled\r\nwith loathsomenesses.\r\n\r\nBut hark the herald of the sun, the auroral wind, softly trumpeting\r\nhis approach! The master-minister of the human tabernacle is at hand!\r\nHeaping before his prow a huge ripple-fretted wave of crimson and gold,\r\nhe rushes aloft, as if new launched from the urging hand of his maker\r\ninto the upper sea--pauses, and looks down on the world. White-raving\r\nstorm of molten metals, he is but a coal from the altar of the Father\'s\r\nnever-ending sacrifice to his children. See every little flower\r\nstraighten its stalk, lift up its neck, and with outstretched head\r\nstand expectant: something more than the sun, greater than the light, is\r\ncoming, is coming--none the less surely coming that it is long upon the\r\nroad! What matters to-day, or to-morrow, or ten thousand years to Life\r\nhimself, to Love himself! He is coming, is coming, and the necks of all\r\nhumanity are stretched out to see him come! Every morning will they thus\r\noutstretch themselves, every evening will they droop and wait--until he\r\ncomes.--Is this but an air-drawn vision? When he comes, will he indeed\r\nfind them watching thus?\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious resurrection-morning. The night had been spent in\r\npreparing it!\r\n\r\nThe children went gamboling before, and the beasts came after us.\r\nFluttering butterflies, darting dragon-flies hovered or shot hither and\r\nthither about our heads, a cloud of colours and flashes, now descending\r\nupon us like a snow-storm of rainbow flakes, now rising into the humid\r\nair like a rolling vapour of embodied odours. It was a summer-day more\r\nlike itself, that is, more ideal, than ever man that had not died\r\nfound summer-day in any world. I walked on the new earth, under the new\r\nheaven, and found them the same as the old, save that now they opened\r\ntheir minds to me, and I saw into them. Now, the soul of everything I\r\nmet came out to greet me and make friends with me, telling me we came\r\nfrom the same, and meant the same. I was going to him, they said, with\r\nwhom they always were, and whom they always meant; they were, they said,\r\nlightnings that took shape as they flashed from him to his. The dark\r\nrocks drank like sponges the rays that showered upon them; the great\r\nworld soaked up the light, and sent out the living. Two joy-fires were\r\nLona and I. Earth breathed heavenward her sweet-savoured smoke; we\r\nbreathed homeward our longing desires. For thanksgiving, our very\r\nconsciousness was that.\r\n\r\nWe came to the channels, once so dry and wearyful: they ran and flashed\r\nand foamed with living water that shouted in its gladness! Far as the\r\neye could see, all was a rushing, roaring, dashing river of water made\r\nvocal by its rocks.\r\n\r\nWe did not cross it, but "walked in glory and in joy" up its right bank,\r\nuntil we reached the great cataract at the foot of the sandy desert,\r\nwhere, roaring and swirling and dropping sheer, the river divided into\r\nits two branches. There we climbed the height--and found no desert:\r\nthrough grassy plains, between grassy banks, flowed the deep, wide,\r\nsilent river full to the brim. Then first to the Little Ones was\r\nrevealed the glory of God in the limpid flow of water. Instinctively\r\nthey plunged and swam, and the beasts followed them.\r\n\r\nThe desert rejoiced and blossomed as the rose. Wide forests had sprung\r\nup, their whole undergrowth flowering shrubs peopled with song-birds.\r\nEvery thicket gave birth to a rivulet, and every rivulet to its\r\nwater-song.\r\n\r\nThe place of the buried hand gave no sign. Beyond and still beyond, the\r\nriver came in full volume from afar. Up and up we went, now along grassy\r\nmargin, and now through forest of gracious trees. The grass grew sweeter\r\nand its flowers more lovely and various as we went; the trees grew\r\nlarger, and the wind fuller of messages.\r\n\r\nWe came at length to a forest whose trees were greater, grander, and\r\nmore beautiful than any we had yet seen. Their live pillars upheaved a\r\nthick embowed roof, betwixt whose leaves and blossoms hardly a sunbeam\r\nfiltered. Into the rafters of this aerial vault the children climbed,\r\nand through them went scrambling and leaping in a land of bloom,\r\nshouting to the unseen elephants below, and hearing them trumpet their\r\nreplies. The conversations between them Lona understood while I but\r\nguessed at them blunderingly. The Little Ones chased the squirrels,\r\nand the squirrels, frolicking, drew them on--always at length allowing\r\nthemselves to be caught and petted. Often would some bird, lovely\r\nin plumage and form, light upon one of them, sing a song of what was\r\ncoming, and fly away. Not one monkey of any sort could they see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI. THE CITY\r\n\r\nLona and I, who walked below, heard at last a great shout overhead, and\r\nin a moment or two the Little Ones began to come dropping down from the\r\nfoliage with the news that, climbing to the top of a tree yet taller\r\nthan the rest, they had descried, far across the plain, a curious\r\nsomething on the side of a solitary mountain--which mountain, they said,\r\nrose and rose, until the sky gathered thick to keep it down, and knocked\r\nits top off.\r\n\r\n"It may be a city," they said, "but it is not at all like Bulika."\r\n\r\nI went up to look, and saw a great city, ascending into blue clouds,\r\nwhere I could not distinguish mountain from sky and cloud, or rocks from\r\ndwellings. Cloud and mountain and sky, palace and precipice mingled in a\r\nseeming chaos of broken shadow and shine.\r\n\r\nI descended, the Little Ones came with me, and together we sped on\r\nfaster. They grew yet merrier as they went, leading the way, and never\r\nlooking behind them. The river grew lovelier and lovelier, until I knew\r\nthat never before had I seen real water. Nothing in this world is more\r\nthan LIKE it.\r\n\r\nBy and by we could from the plain see the city among the blue clouds.\r\nBut other clouds were gathering around a lofty tower--or was it a\r\nrock?--that stood above the city, nearer the crest of the mountain.\r\nGray, and dark gray, and purple, they writhed in confused, contrariant\r\nmotions, and tossed up a vaporous foam, while spots in them gyrated like\r\nwhirlpools. At length issued a dazzling flash, which seemed for a\r\nmoment to play about the Little Ones in front of us. Blinding darkness\r\nfollowed, but through it we heard their voices, low with delight.\r\n\r\n"Did you see?"\r\n\r\n"I saw."\r\n\r\n"What did you see?"\r\n\r\n"The beautifullest man."\r\n\r\n"I heard him speak!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t: what did he say?"\r\n\r\nHere answered the smallest and most childish of the voices--that of\r\nLuva:--\r\n\r\n"He said, \'\'Ou\'s all mine\'s, \'ickle ones: come along!\'"\r\n\r\nI had seen the lightning, but heard no words; Lona saw and heard with\r\nthe children. A second flash came, and my eyes, though not my ears,\r\nwere opened. The great quivering light was compact of angel-faces. They\r\nlamped themselves visible, and vanished.\r\n\r\nA third flash came; its substance and radiance were human.\r\n\r\n"I see my mother!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"I see lots o\' mothers!" said Luva.\r\n\r\nOnce more the cloud flashed--all kinds of creatures--horses and\r\nelephants, lions and dogs--oh, such beasts! And such birds!--great birds\r\nwhose wings gleamed singly every colour gathered in sunset or rainbow!\r\nlittle birds whose feathers sparkled as with all the precious stones\r\nof the hoarding earth!--silvery cranes; red flamingoes; opal pigeons;\r\npeacocks gorgeous in gold and green and blue; jewelly humming\r\nbirds!--great-winged butterflies; lithe-volumed creeping things--all in\r\none heavenly flash!\r\n\r\n"I see that serpents grow birds here, as caterpillars used to grow\r\nbutterflies!" remarked Lona.\r\n\r\n"I saw my white pony, that died when I was a child.--I needn\'t have been\r\nso sorry; I should just have waited!" I said.\r\n\r\nThunder, clap or roll, there had been none. And now came a sweet rain,\r\nfilling the atmosphere with a caressing coolness. We breathed deep, and\r\nstepped out with stronger strides. The falling drops flashed the colours\r\nof all the waked up gems of the earth, and a mighty rainbow spanned the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe blue clouds gathered thicker; the rain fell in torrents; the\r\nchildren exulted and ran; it was all we could do to keep them in sight.\r\n\r\nWith silent, radiant roll, the river swept onward, filling to the margin\r\nits smooth, soft, yielding channel. For, instead of rock or shingle or\r\nsand, it flowed over grass in which grew primroses and daisies, crocuses\r\nand narcissi, pimpernels and anemones, a starry multitude, large and\r\nbright through the brilliant water. The river had gathered no turbid\r\ncloudiness from the rain, not even a tinge of yellow or brown; the\r\ndelicate mass shone with the pale berylline gleam that ascended from its\r\ndeep, dainty bed.\r\n\r\nDrawing nearer to the mountain, we saw that the river came from its very\r\npeak, and rushed in full volume through the main street of the city.\r\nIt descended to the gate by a stair of deep and wide steps, mingled of\r\nporphyry and serpentine, which continued to the foot of the mountain.\r\nThere arriving we found shallower steps on both banks, leading up to\r\nthe gate, and along the ascending street. Without the briefest halt, the\r\nLittle Ones ran straight up the stair to the gate, which stood open.\r\n\r\nOutside, on the landing, sat the portress, a woman-angel of dark visage,\r\nleaning her shadowed brow on her idle hand. The children rushed upon\r\nher, covering her with caresses, and ere she understood, they had taken\r\nheaven by surprise, and were already in the city, still mounting the\r\nstair by the side of the descending torrent. A great angel, attended\r\nby a company of shining ones, came down to meet and receive them, but\r\nmerrily evading them all, up still they ran. In merry dance, however,\r\na group of woman-angels descended upon them, and in a moment they were\r\nfettered in heavenly arms. The radiants carried them away, and I saw\r\nthem no more.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the mighty angel, continuing his descent to meet us who were\r\nnow almost at the gate and within hearing of his words, "this is well!\r\nthese are soldiers to take heaven itself by storm!--I hear of a horde of\r\nblack bats on the frontiers: these will make short work with such!"\r\n\r\nSeeing the horse and the elephants clambering up behind us--\r\n\r\n"Take those animals to the royal stables," he added; "there tend them;\r\nthen turn them into the king\'s forest."\r\n\r\n"Welcome home!" he said to us, bending low with the sweetest smile.\r\n\r\nImmediately he turned and led the way higher. The scales of his armour\r\nflashed like flakes of lightning.\r\n\r\nThought cannot form itself to tell what I felt, thus received by the\r\nofficers of heaven***. All I wanted and knew not, must be on its way to\r\nme!\r\n\r\nWe stood for a moment at the gate whence issued roaring the radiant\r\nriver. I know not whence came the stones that fashioned it, but among\r\nthem I saw the prototypes of all the gems I had loved on earth--far more\r\nbeautiful than they, for these were living stones--such in which I saw,\r\nnot the intent alone, but the intender too; not the idea alone, but the\r\nimbodier present, the operant outsender: nothing in this kingdom was\r\ndead; nothing was mere; nothing only a thing.\r\n\r\nWe went up through the city and passed out. There was no wall on the\r\nupper side, but a huge pile of broken rocks, upsloping like the moraine\r\nof an eternal glacier; and through the openings between the rocks, the\r\nriver came billowing out. On their top I could dimly discern what seemed\r\nthree or four great steps of a stair, disappearing in a cloud white as\r\nsnow; and above the steps I saw, but with my mind\'s eye only, as it were\r\na grand old chair, the throne of the Ancient of Days. Over and under and\r\nbetween those steps issued, plenteously, unceasingly new-born, the river\r\nof the water of life.\r\n\r\nThe great angel could guide us no farther: those rocks we must ascend\r\nalone!\r\n\r\nMy heart beating with hope and desire, I held faster the hand of my\r\nLona, and we began to climb; but soon we let each other go, to use hands\r\nas well as feet in the toilsome ascent of the huge stones. At length\r\nwe drew near the cloud, which hung down the steps like the borders of a\r\ngarment, passed through the fringe, and entered the deep folds. A hand,\r\nwarm and strong, laid hold of mine, and drew me to a little door with a\r\ngolden lock. The door opened; the hand let mine go, and pushed me gently\r\nthrough. I turned quickly, and saw the board of a large book in the act\r\nof closing behind me. I stood alone in my library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII. THE "ENDLESS ENDING"\r\n\r\nAs yet I have not found Lona, but Mara is much with me. She has taught\r\nme many things, and is teaching me more.\r\n\r\nCan it be that that last waking also was in the dream? that I am still\r\nin the chamber of death, asleep and dreaming, not yet ripe enough to\r\nwake? Or can it be that I did not go to sleep outright and heartily,\r\nand so have come awake too soon? If that waking was itself but a dream,\r\nsurely it was a dream of a better waking yet to come, and I have not\r\nbeen the sport of a false vision! Such a dream must have yet lovelier\r\ntruth at the heart of its dreaming!\r\n\r\nIn moments of doubt I cry,\r\n\r\n"Could God Himself create such lovely things as I dreamed?"\r\n\r\n"Whence then came thy dream?" answers Hope.\r\n\r\n"Out of my dark self, into the light of my consciousness."\r\n\r\n"But whence first into thy dark self?" rejoins Hope.\r\n\r\n"My brain was its mother, and the fever in my blood its father."\r\n\r\n"Say rather," suggests Hope, "thy brain was the violin whence it issued,\r\nand the fever in thy blood the bow that drew it forth.--But who made\r\nthe violin? and who guided the bow across its strings? Say rather,\r\nagain--who set the song birds each on its bough in the tree of life, and\r\nstartled each in its order from its perch? Whence came the fantasia? and\r\nwhence the life that danced thereto? Didst THOU say, in the dark of thy\r\nown unconscious self, \'Let beauty be; let truth seem!\' and straightway\r\nbeauty was, and truth but seemed?"\r\n\r\nMan dreams and desires; God broods and wills and quickens.\r\n\r\nWhen a man dreams his own dream, he is the sport of his dream; when\r\nAnother gives it him, that Other is able to fulfil it.\r\n\r\nI have never again sought the mirror. The hand sent me back: I will not\r\ngo out again by that door! "All the days of my appointed time will I\r\nwait till my change come."\r\n\r\nNow and then, when I look round on my books, they seem to waver as if\r\na wind rippled their solid mass, and another world were about to break\r\nthrough. Sometimes when I am abroad, a like thing takes place; the\r\nheavens and the earth, the trees and the grass appear for a moment to\r\nshake as if about to pass away; then, lo, they have settled again into\r\nthe old familiar face! At times I seem to hear whisperings around me, as\r\nif some that loved me were talking of me; but when I would distinguish\r\nthe words, they cease, and all is very still. I know not whether these\r\nthings rise in my brain, or enter it from without. I do not seek them;\r\nthey come, and I let them go.\r\n\r\nStrange dim memories, which will not abide identification, often,\r\nthrough misty windows of the past, look out upon me in the broad\r\ndaylight, but I never dream now. It may be, notwithstanding, that, when\r\nmost awake, I am only dreaming the more! But when I wake at last into\r\nthat life which, as a mother her child, carries this life in its bosom,\r\nI shall know that I wake, and shall doubt no more.\r\n\r\nI wait; asleep or awake, I wait.\r\n\r\nNovalis says, "Our life is no dream, but it should and will perhaps\r\nbecome one."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *Chapter 42: William Law.\r\n\r\n     **Chapter 45: Tin tin sonando con si dolce nota\r\n                   Che \'l ben disposto spirito d\' amor turge.\r\n                                        DEL PARADISO, x. 142.\r\n\r\n     ***Chapter 46: Oma\' vedrai di si fatti uficiali.\r\n                                        Del Purgatorio, ii. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lilith, by George MacDonald\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LILITH ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1640.txt or 1640.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/4/1640/\r\n\r\nProduced by John Bechard\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
