It was reported on good authority that he\r\nwas in receipt of one of the largest incomes derived from the practice\r\nof medicine in modern times.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, towards the close of the London season, the Doctor had\r\njust taken his luncheon after a specially hard morning\'s work in his\r\nconsulting-room, and with a formidable list of visits to patients at\r\ntheir own houses to fill up the rest of his day--when the servant\r\nannounced that a lady wished to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\'Who is she?\' the Doctor asked. \'A stranger?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see no strangers out of consulting-hours. Tell her what the hours\r\nare, and send her away.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have told her, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'And she won\'t go.\'\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t go?\' The Doctor smiled as he repeated the words. He was a\r\nhumourist in his way; and there was an absurd side to the situation\r\nwhich rather amused him. \'Has this obstinate lady given you her name?\'\r\nhe inquired.\r\n\r\n\'No, sir. She refused to give any name--she said she wouldn\'t keep you\r\nfive minutes, and the matter was too important to wait till to-morrow.\r\nThere she is in the consulting-room; and how to get her out again is\r\nmore than I know.\'\r\n\r\nDoctor Wybrow considered for a moment. His knowledge of women\r\n(professionally speaking) rested on the ripe experience of more than\r\nthirty years; he had met with them in all their varieties--especially\r\nthe variety which knows nothing of the value of time, and never\r\nhesitates at sheltering itself behind the privileges of its sex. A\r\nglance at his watch informed him that he must soon begin his rounds\r\namong the patients who were waiting for him at their own houses. He\r\ndecided forthwith on taking the only wise course that was open under\r\nthe circumstances. In other words, he decided on taking to flight.\r\n\r\n\'Is the carriage at the door?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well. Open the house-door for me without making any noise, and\r\nleave the lady in undisturbed possession of the consulting-room. When\r\nshe gets tired of waiting, you know what to tell her. If she asks when\r\nI am expected to return, say that I dine at my club, and spend the\r\nevening at the theatre. Now then, softly, Thomas! If your shoes\r\ncreak, I am a lost man.\'\r\n\r\nHe noiselessly led the way into the hall, followed by the servant on\r\ntip-toe.\r\n\r\nDid the lady in the consulting-room suspect him? or did Thomas\'s shoes\r\ncreak, and was her sense of hearing unusually keen? Whatever the\r\nexplanation may be, the event that actually happened was beyond all\r\ndoubt. Exactly as Doctor Wybrow passed his consulting-room, the door\r\nopened--the lady appeared on the threshold--and laid her hand on his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\'I entreat you, sir, not to go away without letting me speak to you\r\nfirst.\'\r\n\r\nThe accent was foreign; the tone was low and firm. Her fingers closed\r\ngently, and yet resolutely, on the Doctor\'s arm.\r\n\r\nNeither her language nor her action had the slightest effect in\r\ninclining him to grant her request. The influence that instantly\r\nstopped him, on the way to his carriage, was the silent influence of\r\nher face. The startling contrast between the corpse-like pallor of her\r\ncomplexion and the overpowering life and light, the glittering metallic\r\nbrightness in her large black eyes, held him literally spell-bound. She\r\nwas dressed in dark colours, with perfect taste; she was of middle\r\nheight, and (apparently) of middle age--say a year or two over thirty.\r\nHer lower features--the nose, mouth, and chin--possessed the fineness\r\nand delicacy of form which is oftener seen among women of foreign races\r\nthan among women of English birth. She was unquestionably a handsome\r\nperson--with the one serious drawback of her ghastly complexion, and\r\nwith the less noticeable defect of a total want of tenderness in the\r\nexpression of her eyes. Apart from his first emotion of surprise, the\r\nfeeling she produced in the Doctor may be described as an overpowering\r\nfeeling of professional curiosity. The case might prove to be\r\nsomething entirely new in his professional experience. \'It looks like\r\nit,\' he thought; \'and it\'s worth waiting for.\'\r\n\r\nShe perceived that she had produced a strong impression of some\r\nkind upon him, and dropped her hold on his arm.\r\n\r\n\'You have comforted many miserable women in your time,\' she said.\r\n\'Comfort one more, to-day.\'\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to be answered, she led the way back into the room.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor followed her, and closed the door. He placed her in the\r\npatients\' chair, opposite the windows. Even in London the sun, on that\r\nsummer afternoon, was dazzlingly bright. The radiant light flowed in\r\non her. Her eyes met it unflinchingly, with the steely steadiness of\r\nthe eyes of an eagle. The smooth pallor of her unwrinkled skin looked\r\nmore fearfully white than ever. For the first time, for many a long\r\nyear past, the Doctor felt his pulse quicken its beat in the presence\r\nof a patient.\r\n\r\nHaving possessed herself of his attention, she appeared, strangely\r\nenough, to have nothing to say to him. A curious apathy seemed to have\r\ntaken possession of this resolute woman. Forced to speak first, the\r\nDoctor merely inquired, in the conventional phrase, what he could do\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice seemed to rouse her. Still looking straight at\r\nthe light, she said abruptly: \'I have a painful question to ask.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\'\r\n\r\nHer eyes travelled slowly from the window to the Doctor\'s face.\r\nWithout the slightest outward appearance of agitation, she put the\r\n\'painful question\' in these extraordinary words:\r\n\r\n\'I want to know, if you please, whether I am in danger of going mad?\'\r\n\r\nSome men might have been amused, and some might have been alarmed.\r\nDoctor Wybrow was only conscious of a sense of disappointment. Was\r\nthis the rare case that he had anticipated, judging rashly by\r\nappearances? Was the new patient only a hypochondriacal woman, whose\r\nmalady was a disordered stomach and whose misfortune was a weak brain?\r\n\'Why do you come to me?\' he asked sharply. \'Why don\'t you consult a\r\ndoctor whose special employment is the treatment of the insane?\'\r\n\r\nShe had her answer ready on the instant.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t go to a doctor of that sort,\' she said, \'for the very reason\r\nthat he is a specialist: he has the fatal habit of judging everybody\r\nby lines and rules of his own laying down. I come to you, because my\r\ncase is outside of all lines and rules, and because you are famous in\r\nyour profession for the discovery of mysteries in disease. Are you\r\nsatisfied?\'\r\n\r\nHe was more than satisfied--his first idea had been the right idea,\r\nafter all. Besides, she was correctly informed as to his professional\r\nposition. The capacity which had raised him to fame and fortune was\r\nhis capacity (unrivalled among his brethren) for the discovery of\r\nremote disease.\r\n\r\n\'I am at your disposal,\' he answered. \'Let me try if I can find out\r\nwhat is the matter with you.\'\r\n\r\nHe put his medical questions. They were promptly and plainly answered;\r\nand they led to no other conclusion than that the strange lady was,\r\nmentally and physically, in excellent health. Not satisfied with\r\nquestions, he carefully examined the great organs of life. Neither his\r\nhand nor his stethoscope could discover anything that was amiss. With\r\nthe admirable patience and devotion to his art which had distinguished\r\nhim from the time when he was a student, he still subjected her to one\r\ntest after another. The result was always the same. Not only was\r\nthere no tendency to brain disease--there was not even a perceptible\r\nderangement of the nervous system. \'I can find nothing the matter with\r\nyou,\' he said. \'I can\'t even account for the extraordinary pallor of\r\nyour complexion. You completely puzzle me.\'\r\n\r\n\'The pallor of my complexion is nothing,\' she answered a little\r\nimpatiently. \'In my early life I had a narrow escape from death by\r\npoisoning. I have never had a complexion since--and my skin is so\r\ndelicate, I cannot paint without producing a hideous rash. But that is\r\nof no importance. I wanted your opinion given positively. I believed\r\nin you, and you have disappointed me.\' Her head dropped on her breast.\r\n\'And so it ends!\' she said to herself bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor\'s sympathies were touched. Perhaps it might be more correct\r\nto say that his professional pride was a little hurt. \'It may end in\r\nthe right way yet,\' he remarked, \'if you choose to help me.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up again with flashing eyes, \'Speak plainly,\' she said.\r\n\'How can I help you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Plainly, madam, you come to me as an enigma, and you leave me to make\r\nthe right guess by the unaided efforts of my art. My art will do much,\r\nbut not all. For example, something must have occurred--something\r\nquite unconnected with the state of your bodily health--to frighten you\r\nabout yourself, or you would never have come here to consult me. Is\r\nthat true?\'\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands in her lap. \'That is true!\' she said eagerly.\r\n\'I begin to believe in you again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well. You can\'t expect me to find out the moral cause which has\r\nalarmed you. I can positively discover that there is no physical cause\r\nof alarm; and (unless you admit me to your confidence) I can do no\r\nmore.\'\r\n\r\nShe rose, and took a turn in the room. \'Suppose I tell you?\' she said.\r\n\'But, mind, I shall mention no names!\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no need to mention names. The facts are all I want.\'\r\n\r\n\'The facts are nothing,\' she rejoined. \'I have only my own impressions\r\nto confess--and you will very likely think me a fanciful fool when you\r\nhear what they are. No matter. I will do my best to content you--I\r\nwill begin with the facts that you want. Take my word for it, they\r\nwon\'t do much to help you.\'\r\n\r\nShe sat down again. In the plainest possible words, she began the\r\nstrangest and wildest confession that had ever reached the Doctor\'s\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n\'It is one fact, sir, that I am a widow,\' she said. \'It is another\r\nfact, that I am going to be married again.\'\r\n\r\nThere she paused, and smiled at some thought that occurred to her.\r\nDoctor Wybrow was not favourably impressed by her smile--there was\r\nsomething at once sad and cruel in it. It came slowly, and it went\r\naway suddenly. He began to doubt whether he had been wise in acting on\r\nhis first impression. His mind reverted to the commonplace patients\r\nand the discoverable maladies that were waiting for him, with a certain\r\ntender regret.\r\n\r\nThe lady went on.\r\n\r\n\'My approaching marriage,\' she said, \'has one embarrassing circumstance\r\nconnected with it. The gentleman whose wife I am to be, was engaged to\r\nanother lady when he happened to meet with me, abroad: that lady, mind,\r\nbeing of his own blood and family, related to him as his cousin. I\r\nhave innocently robbed her of her lover, and destroyed her prospects in\r\nlife. Innocently, I say--because he told me nothing of his engagement\r\nuntil after I had accepted him. When we next met in England--and when\r\nthere was danger, no doubt, of the affair coming to my knowledge--he\r\ntold me the truth. I was naturally indignant. He had his excuse\r\nready; he showed me a letter from the lady herself, releasing him from\r\nhis engagement. A more noble, a more high-minded letter, I never read\r\nin my life. I cried over it--I who have no tears in me for sorrows of\r\nmy own! If the letter had left him any hope of being forgiven, I would\r\nhave positively refused to marry him. But the firmness of it--without\r\nanger, without a word of reproach, with heartfelt wishes even for his\r\nhappiness--the firmness of it, I say, left him no hope. He appealed to\r\nmy compassion; he appealed to his love for me. You know what women\r\nare. I too was soft-hearted--I said, Very well: yes! In a week more\r\n(I tremble as I think of it) we are to be married.\'\r\n\r\nShe did really tremble--she was obliged to pause and compose herself,\r\nbefore she could go on. The Doctor, waiting for more facts, began to\r\nfear that he stood committed to a long story. \'Forgive me for\r\nreminding you that I have suffering persons waiting to see me,\' he\r\nsaid. \'The sooner you can come to the point, the better for my\r\npatients and for me.\'\r\n\r\nThe strange smile--at once so sad and so cruel--showed itself again on\r\nthe lady\'s lips. \'Every word I have said is to the point,\' she\r\nanswered. \'You will see it yourself in a moment more.\'\r\n\r\nShe resumed her narrative.\r\n\r\n\'Yesterday--you need fear no long story, sir; only yesterday--I was\r\namong the visitors at one of your English luncheon parties. A lady, a\r\nperfect stranger to me, came in late--after we had left the table, and\r\nhad retired to the drawing-room. She happened to take a chair near me;\r\nand we were presented to each other. I knew her by name, as she knew\r\nme. It was the woman whom I had robbed of her lover, the woman who had\r\nwritten the noble letter. Now listen! You were impatient with me for\r\nnot interesting you in what I said just now. I said it to satisfy your\r\nmind that I had no enmity of feeling towards the lady, on my side. I\r\nadmired her, I felt for her--I had no cause to reproach myself. This\r\nis very important, as you will presently see. On her side, I have\r\nreason to be assured that the circumstances had been truly explained to\r\nher, and that she understood I was in no way to blame. Now, knowing\r\nall these necessary things as you do, explain to me, if you can, why,\r\nwhen I rose and met that woman\'s eyes looking at me, I turned cold from\r\nhead to foot, and shuddered, and shivered, and knew what a deadly panic\r\nof fear was, for the first time in my life.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor began to feel interested at last.\r\n\r\n\'Was there anything remarkable in the lady\'s personal appearance?\' he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing whatever!\' was the vehement reply. \'Here is the true\r\ndescription of her:--The ordinary English lady; the clear cold blue\r\neyes, the fine rosy complexion, the inanimately polite manner, the\r\nlarge good-humoured mouth, the too plump cheeks and chin: these, and\r\nnothing more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was there anything in her expression, when you first looked at her,\r\nthat took you by surprise?\'\r\n\r\n\'There was natural curiosity to see the woman who had been preferred to\r\nher; and perhaps some astonishment also, not to see a more engaging and\r\nmore beautiful person; both those feelings restrained within the limits\r\nof good breeding, and both not lasting for more than a few moments--so\r\nfar as I could see. I say, "so far," because the horrible agitation\r\nthat she communicated to me disturbed my judgment. If I could have got\r\nto the door, I would have run out of the room, she frightened me so! I\r\nwas not even able to stand up--I sank back in my chair; I stared\r\nhorror-struck at the calm blue eyes that were only looking at me with a\r\ngentle surprise. To say they affected me like the eyes of a serpent is\r\nto say nothing. I felt her soul in them, looking into mine--looking,\r\nif such a thing can be, unconsciously to her own mortal self. I tell\r\nyou my impression, in all its horror and in all its folly! That woman\r\nis destined (without knowing it herself) to be the evil genius of my\r\nlife. Her innocent eyes saw hidden capabilities of wickedness in me\r\nthat I was not aware of myself, until I felt them stirring under her\r\nlook. If I commit faults in my life to come--if I am even guilty of\r\ncrimes--she will bring the retribution, without (as I firmly believe)\r\nany conscious exercise of her own will. In one indescribable moment I\r\nfelt all this--and I suppose my face showed it. The good artless\r\ncreature was inspired by a sort of gentle alarm for me. "I am afraid\r\nthe heat of the room is too much for you; will you try my smelling\r\nbottle?" I heard her say those kind words; and I remember nothing\r\nelse--I fainted. When I recovered my senses, the company had all gone;\r\nonly the lady of the house was with me. For the moment I could say\r\nnothing to her; the dreadful impression that I have tried to describe\r\nto you came back to me with the coming back of my life. As soon I\r\ncould speak, I implored her to tell me the whole truth about the woman\r\nwhom I had supplanted. You see, I had a faint hope that her good\r\ncharacter might not really be deserved, that her noble letter was a\r\nskilful piece of hypocrisy--in short, that she secretly hated me, and\r\nwas cunning enough to hide it. No! the lady had been her friend from\r\nher girlhood, was as familiar with her as if they had been\r\nsisters--knew her positively to be as good, as innocent, as incapable\r\nof hating anybody, as the greatest saint that ever lived. My one last\r\nhope, that I had only felt an ordinary forewarning of danger in the\r\npresence of an ordinary enemy, was a hope destroyed for ever. There\r\nwas one more effort I could make, and I made it. I went next to the\r\nman whom I am to marry. I implored him to release me from my promise.\r\nHe refused. I declared I would break my engagement. He showed me\r\nletters from his sisters, letters from his brothers, and his dear\r\nfriends--all entreating him to think again before he made me his wife;\r\nall repeating reports of me in Paris, Vienna, and London, which are so\r\nmany vile lies. "If you refuse to marry me," he said, "you admit that\r\nthese reports are true--you admit that you are afraid to face society\r\nin the character of my wife." What could I answer? There was no\r\ncontradicting him--he was plainly right: if I persisted in my refusal,\r\nthe utter destruction of my reputation would be the result. I\r\nconsented to let the wedding take place as we had arranged it--and left\r\nhim. The night has passed. I am here, with my fixed conviction--that\r\ninnocent woman is ordained to have a fatal influence over my life. I\r\nam here with my one question to put, to the one man who can answer it.\r\nFor the last time, sir, what am I--a demon who has seen the avenging\r\nangel? or only a poor mad woman, misled by the delusion of a deranged\r\nmind?\'\r\n\r\nDoctor Wybrow rose from his chair, determined to close the interview.\r\n\r\nHe was strongly and painfully impressed by what he had heard. The\r\nlonger he had listened to her, the more irresistibly the conviction of\r\nthe woman\'s wickedness had forced itself on him. He tried vainly to\r\nthink of her as a person to be pitied--a person with a morbidly\r\nsensitive imagination, conscious of the capacities for evil which lie\r\ndormant in us all, and striving earnestly to open her heart to the\r\ncounter-influence of her own better nature; the effort was beyond him.\r\nA perverse instinct in him said, as if in words, Beware how you believe\r\nin her!\r\n\r\n\'I have already given you my opinion,\' he said. \'There is no sign of\r\nyour intellect being deranged, or being likely to be deranged, that\r\nmedical science can discover--as I understand it. As for the\r\nimpressions you have confided to me, I can only say that yours is a\r\ncase (as I venture to think) for spiritual rather than for medical\r\nadvice. Of one thing be assured: what you have said to me in this room\r\nshall not pass out of it. Your confession is safe in my keeping.\'\r\n\r\nShe heard him, with a certain dogged resignation, to the end.\r\n\r\n\'Is that all?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'That is all,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nShe put a little paper packet of money on the table. \'Thank you, sir.\r\nThere is your fee.\'\r\n\r\nWith those words she rose. Her wild black eyes looked upward, with an\r\nexpression of despair so defiant and so horrible in its silent agony\r\nthat the Doctor turned away his head, unable to endure the sight of it.\r\nThe bare idea of taking anything from her--not money only, but anything\r\neven that she had touched--suddenly revolted him. Still without\r\nlooking at her, he said, \'Take it back; I don\'t want my fee.\'\r\n\r\nShe neither heeded nor heard him. Still looking upward, she said\r\nslowly to herself, \'Let the end come. I have done with the struggle: I\r\nsubmit.\'\r\n\r\nShe drew her veil over her face, bowed to the Doctor, and left the room.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell, and followed her into the hall. As the servant\r\nclosed the door on her, a sudden impulse of curiosity--utterly unworthy\r\nof him, and at the same time utterly irresistible--sprang up in the\r\nDoctor\'s mind. Blushing like a boy, he said to the servant, \'Follow\r\nher home, and find out her name.\' For one moment the man looked at his\r\nmaster, doubting if his own ears had not deceived him. Doctor Wybrow\r\nlooked back at him in silence. The submissive servant knew what that\r\nsilence meant--he took his hat and hurried into the street.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor went back to the consulting-room. A sudden revulsion of\r\nfeeling swept over his mind. Had the woman left an infection of\r\nwickedness in the house, and had he caught it? What devil had\r\npossessed him to degrade himself in the eyes of his own servant? He\r\nhad behaved infamously--he had asked an honest man, a man who had\r\nserved him faithfully for years, to turn spy! Stung by the bare\r\nthought of it, he ran out into the hall again, and opened the door.\r\nThe servant had disappeared; it was too late to call him back. But one\r\nrefuge from his contempt for himself was now open to him--the refuge of\r\nwork. He got into his carriage and went his rounds among his patients.\r\n\r\nIf the famous physician could have shaken his own reputation, he would\r\nhave done it that afternoon. Never before had he made himself so\r\nlittle welcome at the bedside. Never before had he put off until\r\nto-morrow the prescription which ought to have been written, the\r\nopinion which ought to have been given, to-day. He went home earlier\r\nthan usual--unutterably dissatisfied with himself.\r\n\r\nThe servant had returned. Dr. Wybrow was ashamed to question him. The\r\nman reported the result of his errand, without waiting to be asked.\r\n\r\n\'The lady\'s name is the Countess Narona. She lives at--\'\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to hear where she lived, the Doctor acknowledged the\r\nall-important discovery of her name by a silent bend of the head, and\r\nentered his consulting-room. The fee that he had vainly refused still\r\nlay in its little white paper covering on the table. He sealed it up\r\nin an envelope; addressed it to the \'Poor-box\' of the nearest\r\npolice-court; and, calling the servant in, directed him to take it to\r\nthe magistrate the next morning. Faithful to his duties, the servant\r\nwaited to ask the customary question, \'Do you dine at home to-day, sir?\'\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s hesitation he said, \'No: I shall dine at the club.\'\r\n\r\nThe most easily deteriorated of all the moral qualities is the quality\r\ncalled \'conscience.\' In one state of a man\'s mind, his conscience is\r\nthe severest judge that can pass sentence on him. In another state, he\r\nand his conscience are on the best possible terms with each other in\r\nthe comfortable capacity of accomplices. When Doctor Wybrow left his\r\nhouse for the second time, he did not even attempt to conceal from\r\nhimself that his sole object, in dining at the club, was to hear what\r\nthe world said of the Countess Narona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time when a man in search of the pleasures of gossip sought\r\nthe society of ladies. The man knows better now. He goes to the\r\nsmoking-room of his club.\r\n\r\nDoctor Wybrow lit his cigar, and looked round him at his brethren in\r\nsocial conclave assembled. The room was well filled; but the flow of\r\ntalk was still languid. The Doctor innocently applied the stimulant\r\nthat was wanted. When he inquired if anybody knew the Countess Narona,\r\nhe was answered by something like a shout of astonishment. Never (the\r\nconclave agreed) had such an absurd question been asked before! Every\r\nhuman creature, with the slightest claim to a place in society, knew\r\nthe Countess Narona. An adventuress with a European reputation of the\r\nblackest possible colour--such was the general description of the woman\r\nwith the deathlike complexion and the glittering eyes.\r\n\r\nDescending to particulars, each member of the club contributed his own\r\nlittle stock of scandal to the memoirs of the Countess. It was\r\ndoubtful whether she was really, what she called herself, a Dalmatian\r\nlady. It was doubtful whether she had ever been married to the Count\r\nwhose widow she assumed to be. It was doubtful whether the man who\r\naccompanied her in her travels (under the name of Baron Rivar, and in\r\nthe character of her brother) was her brother at all. Report pointed\r\nto the Baron as a gambler at every \'table\' on the Continent. Report\r\nwhispered that his so-called sister had narrowly escaped being\r\nimplicated in a famous trial for poisoning at Vienna--that she had been\r\nknown at Milan as a spy in the interests of Austria--that her\r\n\'apartment\' in Paris had been denounced to the police as nothing less\r\nthan a private gambling-house--and that her present appearance in\r\nEngland was the natural result of the discovery. Only one member of\r\nthe assembly in the smoking-room took the part of this much-abused\r\nwoman, and declared that her character had been most cruelly and most\r\nunjustly assailed. But as the man was a lawyer, his interference went\r\nfor nothing: it was naturally attributed to the spirit of contradiction\r\ninherent in his profession. He was asked derisively what he thought of\r\nthe circumstances under which the Countess had become engaged to be\r\nmarried; and he made the characteristic answer, that he thought the\r\ncircumstances highly creditable to both parties, and that he looked on\r\nthe lady\'s future husband as a most enviable man.\r\n\r\nHearing this, the Doctor raised another shout of astonishment by\r\ninquiring the name of the gentleman whom the Countess was about to\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\nHis friends in the smoking-room decided unanimously that the celebrated\r\nphysician must be a second \'Rip-van-Winkle,\' and that he had just\r\nawakened from a supernatural sleep of twenty years. It was all very\r\nwell to say that he was devoted to his profession, and that he had\r\nneither time nor inclination to pick up fragments of gossip at\r\ndinner-parties and balls. A man who did not know that the Countess\r\nNarona had borrowed money at Homburg of no less a person than Lord\r\nMontbarry, and had then deluded him into making her a proposal of\r\nmarriage, was a man who had probably never heard of Lord Montbarry\r\nhimself. The younger members of the club, humouring the joke, sent a\r\nwaiter for the \'Peerage\'; and read aloud the memoir of the nobleman in\r\nquestion, for the Doctor\'s benefit--with illustrative morsels of\r\ninformation interpolated by themselves.\r\n\r\n\'Herbert John Westwick. First Baron Montbarry, of Montbarry, King\'s\r\nCounty, Ireland. Created a Peer for distinguished military services in\r\nIndia. Born, 1812. Forty-eight years old, Doctor, at the present\r\ntime. Not married. Will be married next week, Doctor, to the\r\ndelightful creature we have been talking about. Heir presumptive, his\r\nlordship\'s next brother, Stephen Robert, married to Ella, youngest\r\ndaughter of the Reverend Silas Marden, Rector of Runnigate, and has\r\nissue, three daughters. Younger brothers of his lordship, Francis and\r\nHenry, unmarried. Sisters of his lordship, Lady Barville, married to\r\nSir Theodore Barville, Bart.; and Anne, widow of the late Peter\r\nNorbury, Esq., of Norbury Cross. Bear his lordship\'s relations well in\r\nmind, Doctor. Three brothers Westwick, Stephen, Francis, and Henry;\r\nand two sisters, Lady Barville and Mrs. Norbury. Not one of the five\r\nwill be present at the marriage; and not one of the five will leave a\r\nstone unturned to stop it, if the Countess will only give them a\r\nchance. Add to these hostile members of the family another offended\r\nrelative not mentioned in the \'Peerage,\' a young lady--\'\r\n\r\nA sudden outburst of protest in more than one part of the room stopped\r\nthe coming disclosure, and released the Doctor from further persecution.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t mention the poor girl\'s name; it\'s too bad to make a joke of\r\nthat part of the business; she has behaved nobly under shameful\r\nprovocation; there is but one excuse for Montbarry--he is either a\r\nmadman or a fool.\' In these terms the protest expressed itself on all\r\nsides. Speaking confidentially to his next neighbour, the Doctor\r\ndiscovered that the lady referred to was already known to him (through\r\nthe Countess\'s confession) as the lady deserted by Lord Montbarry. Her\r\nname was Agnes Lockwood. She was described as being the superior of\r\nthe Countess in personal attraction, and as being also by some years\r\nthe younger woman of the two. Making all allowance for the follies\r\nthat men committed every day in their relations with women, Montbarry\'s\r\ndelusion was still the most monstrous delusion on record. In this\r\nexpression of opinion every man present agreed--the lawyer even\r\nincluded. Not one of them could call to mind the innumerable instances\r\nin which the sexual influence has proved irresistible in the persons of\r\nwomen without even the pretension to beauty. The very members of the\r\nclub whom the Countess (in spite of her personal disadvantages) could\r\nhave most easily fascinated, if she had thought it worth her while,\r\nwere the members who wondered most loudly at Montbarry\'s choice of a\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWhile the topic of the Countess\'s marriage was still the one topic of\r\nconversation, a member of the club entered the smoking-room whose\r\nappearance instantly produced a dead silence. Doctor Wybrow\'s next\r\nneighbour whispered to him, \'Montbarry\'s brother--Henry Westwick!\'\r\n\r\nThe new-comer looked round him slowly, with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n\'You are all talking of my brother,\' he said. \'Don\'t mind me. Not one\r\nof you can despise him more heartily than I do. Go on, gentlemen--go\r\non!\'\r\n\r\nBut one man present took the speaker at his word. That man was the\r\nlawyer who had already undertaken the defence of the Countess.\r\n\r\n\'I stand alone in my opinion,\' he said, \'and I am not ashamed of\r\nrepeating it in anybody\'s hearing. I consider the Countess Narona to\r\nbe a cruelly-treated woman. Why shouldn\'t she be Lord Montbarry\'s\r\nwife? Who can say she has a mercenary motive in marrying him?\'\r\n\r\nMontbarry\'s brother turned sharply on the speaker. \'I say it!\' he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe reply might have shaken some men. The lawyer stood on his ground\r\nas firmly as ever.\r\n\r\n\'I believe I am right,\' he rejoined, \'in stating that his lordship\'s\r\nincome is not more than sufficient to support his station in life; also\r\nthat it is an income derived almost entirely from landed property in\r\nIreland, every acre of which is entailed.\'\r\n\r\nMontbarry\'s brother made a sign, admitting that he had no objection to\r\noffer so far.\r\n\r\n\'If his lordship dies first,\' the lawyer proceeded, \'I have been\r\ninformed that the only provision he can make for his widow consists in\r\na rent-charge on the property of no more than four hundred a year. His\r\nretiring pension and allowances, it is well known, die with him. Four\r\nhundred a year is therefore all that he can leave to the Countess, if\r\nhe leaves her a widow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Four hundred a year is not all,\' was the reply to this. \'My brother\r\nhas insured his life for ten thousand pounds; and he has settled the\r\nwhole of it on the Countess, in the event of his death.\'\r\n\r\nThis announcement produced a strong sensation. Men looked at each\r\nother, and repeated the three startling words, \'Ten thousand pounds!\'\r\nDriven fairly to the wall, the lawyer made a last effort to defend his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\'May I ask who made that settlement a condition of the marriage?\' he\r\nsaid. \'Surely it was not the Countess herself?.\'\r\n\r\nHenry Westwick answered, \'It was the Countess\'s brother\'; and added,\r\n\'which comes to the same thing.\'\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was no more to be said--so long, at least, as\r\nMontbarry\'s brother was present. The talk flowed into other channels;\r\nand the Doctor went home.\r\n\r\nBut his morbid curiosity about the Countess was not set at rest yet.\r\nIn his leisure moments he found himself wondering whether Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s family would succeed in stopping the marriage after all.\r\nAnd more than this, he was conscious of a growing desire to see the\r\ninfatuated man himself. Every day during the brief interval before the\r\nwedding, he looked in at the club, on the chance of hearing some news.\r\nNothing had happened, so far as the club knew. The Countess\'s position\r\nwas secure; Montbarry\'s resolution to be her husband was unshaken.\r\nThey were both Roman Catholics, and they were to be married at the\r\nchapel in Spanish Place. So much the Doctor discovered about them--and\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the wedding, after a feeble struggle with himself, he\r\nactually sacrificed his patients and their guineas, and slipped away\r\nsecretly to see the marriage. To the end of his life, he was angry\r\nwith anybody who reminded him of what he had done on that day!\r\n\r\nThe wedding was strictly private. A close carriage stood at the church\r\ndoor; a few people, mostly of the lower class, and mostly old women,\r\nwere scattered about the interior of the building. Here and there\r\nDoctor Wybrow detected the faces of some of his brethren of the club,\r\nattracted by curiosity, like himself. Four persons only stood before\r\nthe altar--the bride and bridegroom and their two witnesses. One of\r\nthese last was an elderly woman, who might have been the Countess\'s\r\ncompanion or maid; the other was undoubtedly her brother, Baron Rivar.\r\nThe bridal party (the bride herself included) wore their ordinary\r\nmorning costume. Lord Montbarry, personally viewed, was a middle-aged\r\nmilitary man of the ordinary type: nothing in the least remarkable\r\ndistinguished him either in face or figure. Baron Rivar, again, in his\r\nway was another conventional representative of another well-known type.\r\nOne sees his finely-pointed moustache, his bold eyes, his\r\ncrisply-curling hair, and his dashing carriage of the head, repeated\r\nhundreds of times over on the Boulevards of Paris. The only noteworthy\r\npoint about him was of the negative sort--he was not in the least like\r\nhis sister. Even the officiating priest was only a harmless,\r\nhumble-looking old man, who went through his duties resignedly, and\r\nfelt visible rheumatic difficulties every time he bent his knees. The\r\none remarkable person, the Countess herself, only raised her veil at\r\nthe beginning of the ceremony, and presented nothing in her plain dress\r\nthat was worth a second look. Never, on the face of it, was there a\r\nless interesting and less romantic marriage than this. From time to\r\ntime the Doctor glanced round at the door or up at the galleries,\r\nvaguely anticipating the appearance of some protesting stranger, in\r\npossession of some terrible secret, commissioned to forbid the progress\r\nof the service. Nothing in the shape of an event occurred--nothing\r\nextraordinary, nothing dramatic. Bound fast together as man and wife,\r\nthe two disappeared, followed by their witnesses, to sign the\r\nregisters; and still Doctor Wybrow waited, and still he cherished the\r\nobstinate hope that something worth seeing must certainly happen yet.\r\n\r\nThe interval passed, and the married couple, returning to the church,\r\nwalked together down the nave to the door. Doctor Wybrow drew back as\r\nthey approached. To his confusion and surprise, the Countess\r\ndiscovered him. He heard her say to her husband, \'One moment; I see a\r\nfriend.\' Lord Montbarry bowed and waited. She stepped up to the\r\nDoctor, took his hand, and wrung it hard. He felt her overpowering\r\nblack eyes looking at him through her veil. \'One step more, you see,\r\non the way to the end!\' She whispered those strange words, and returned\r\nto her husband. Before the Doctor could recover himself and follow\r\nher, Lord and Lady Montbarry had stepped into their carriage, and had\r\ndriven away.\r\n\r\nOutside the church door stood the three or four members of the club\r\nwho, like Doctor Wybrow, had watched the ceremony out of curiosity.\r\nNear them was the bride\'s brother, waiting alone. He was evidently\r\nbent on seeing the man whom his sister had spoken to, in broad\r\ndaylight. His bold eyes rested on the Doctor\'s face, with a momentary\r\nflash of suspicion in them. The cloud suddenly cleared away; the Baron\r\nsmiled with charming courtesy, lifted his hat to his sister\'s friend,\r\nand walked off.\r\n\r\nThe members constituted themselves into a club conclave on the church\r\nsteps. They began with the Baron. \'Damned ill-looking rascal!\' They\r\nwent on with Montbarry. \'Is he going to take that horrid woman with\r\nhim to Ireland?\' \'Not he! he can\'t face the tenantry; they know about\r\nAgnes Lockwood.\' \'Well, but where is he going?\' \'To Scotland.\' \'Does\r\nshe like that?\' \'It\'s only for a fortnight; they come back to London,\r\nand go abroad.\' \'And they will never return to England, eh?\' \'Who can\r\ntell? Did you see how she looked at Montbarry, when she had to lift\r\nher veil at the beginning of the service? In his place, I should have\r\nbolted. Did you see her, Doctor?\' By this time, Doctor Wybrow had\r\nremembered his patients, and had heard enough of the club gossip. He\r\nfollowed the example of Baron Rivar, and walked off.\r\n\r\n\'One step more, you see, on the way to the end,\' he repeated to\r\nhimself, on his way home. \'What end?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of the marriage Agnes Lockwood sat alone in the little\r\ndrawing-room of her London lodgings, burning the letters which had been\r\nwritten to her by Montbarry in the bygone time.\r\n\r\nThe Countess\'s maliciously smart description of her, addressed to\r\nDoctor Wybrow, had not even hinted at the charm that most distinguished\r\nAgnes--the artless expression of goodness and purity which instantly\r\nattracted everyone who approached her. She looked by many years\r\nyounger than she really was. With her fair complexion and her shy\r\nmanner, it seemed only natural to speak of her as \'a girl,\' although\r\nshe was now really advancing towards thirty years of age. She lived\r\nalone with an old nurse devoted to her, on a modest little income which\r\nwas just enough to support the two. There were none of the ordinary\r\nsigns of grief in her face, as she slowly tore the letters of her false\r\nlover in two, and threw the pieces into the small fire which had been\r\nlit to consume them. Unhappily for herself, she was one of those women\r\nwho feel too deeply to find relief in tears. Pale and quiet, with cold\r\ntrembling fingers, she destroyed the letters one by one without daring\r\nto read them again. She had torn the last of the series, and was still\r\nshrinking from throwing it after the rest into the swiftly destroying\r\nflame, when the old nurse came in, and asked if she would see \'Master\r\nHenry,\'--meaning that youngest member of the Westwick family, who had\r\npublicly declared his contempt for his brother in the smoking-room of\r\nthe club.\r\n\r\nAgnes hesitated. A faint tinge of colour stole over her face.\r\n\r\nThere had been a long past time when Henry Westwick had owned that he\r\nloved her. She had made her confession to him, acknowledging that her\r\nheart was given to his eldest brother. He had submitted to his\r\ndisappointment; and they had met thenceforth as cousins and friends.\r\nNever before had she associated the idea of him with embarrassing\r\nrecollections. But now, on the very day when his brother\'s marriage to\r\nanother woman had consummated his brother\'s treason towards her, there\r\nwas something vaguely repellent in the prospect of seeing him. The old\r\nnurse (who remembered them both in their cradles) observed her\r\nhesitation; and sympathising of course with the man, put in a timely\r\nword for Henry. \'He says, he\'s going away, my dear; and he only wants\r\nto shake hands, and say good-bye.\' This plain statement of the case had\r\nits effect. Agnes decided on receiving her cousin.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room so rapidly that he surprised her in the act of\r\nthrowing the fragments of Montbarry\'s last letter into the fire. She\r\nhurriedly spoke first.\r\n\r\n\'You are leaving London very suddenly, Henry. Is it business? or\r\npleasure?\'\r\n\r\nInstead of answering her, he pointed to the flaming letter, and to some\r\nblack ashes of burnt paper lying lightly in the lower part of the\r\nfireplace.\r\n\r\n\'Are you burning letters?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'His letters?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\nHe took her hand gently. \'I had no idea I was intruding on you, at a\r\ntime when you must wish to be alone. Forgive me, Agnes--I shall see\r\nyou when I return.\'\r\n\r\nShe signed to him, with a faint smile, to take a chair.\r\n\r\n\'We have known one another since we were children,\' she said. \'Why\r\nshould I feel a foolish pride about myself in your presence? why should\r\nI have any secrets from you? I sent back all your brother\'s gifts to\r\nme some time ago. I have been advised to do more, to keep nothing that\r\ncan remind me of him--in short, to burn his letters. I have taken the\r\nadvice; but I own I shrank a little from destroying the last of the\r\nletters. No--not because it was the last, but because it had this in\r\nit.\' She opened her hand, and showed him a lock of Montbarry\'s hair,\r\ntied with a morsel of golden cord. \'Well! well! let it go with the\r\nrest.\'\r\n\r\nShe dropped it into the flame. For a while, she stood with her back to\r\nHenry, leaning on the mantel-piece, and looking into the fire. He took\r\nthe chair to which she had pointed, with a strange contradiction of\r\nexpression in his face: the tears were in his eyes, while the brows\r\nabove were knit close in an angry frown. He muttered to himself, \'Damn\r\nhim!\'\r\n\r\nShe rallied her courage, and looked at him again when she spoke.\r\n\'Well, Henry, and why are you going away?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am out of spirits, Agnes, and I want a change.\'\r\n\r\nShe paused before she spoke again. His face told her plainly that he\r\nwas thinking of her when he made that reply. She was grateful to him,\r\nbut her mind was not with him: her mind was still with the man who had\r\ndeserted her. She turned round again to the fire.\r\n\r\n\'Is it true,\' she asked, after a long silence, \'that they have been\r\nmarried to-day?\'\r\n\r\nHe answered ungraciously in the one necessary word:--\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you go to the church?\'\r\n\r\nHe resented the question with an expression of indignant surprise. \'Go\r\nto the church?\' he repeated. \'I would as soon go to--\' He checked\r\nhimself there. \'How can you ask?\' he added in lower tones. \'I have\r\nnever spoken to Montbarry, I have not even seen him, since he treated\r\nyou like the scoundrel and the fool that he is.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him suddenly, without saying a word. He understood her,\r\nand begged her pardon. But he was still angry. \'The reckoning comes\r\nto some men,\' he said, \'even in this world. He will live to rue the\r\nday when he married that woman!\'\r\n\r\nAgnes took a chair by his side, and looked at him with a gentle\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\'Is it quite reasonable to be so angry with her, because your brother\r\npreferred her to me?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nHenry turned on her sharply. \'Do you defend the Countess, of all the\r\npeople in the world?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' Agnes answered. \'I know nothing against her. On the only\r\noccasion when we met, she appeared to be a singularly timid, nervous\r\nperson, looking dreadfully ill; and being indeed so ill that she\r\nfainted under the heat of my room. Why should we not do her justice?\r\nWe know that she was innocent of any intention to wrong me; we know\r\nthat she was not aware of my engagement--\'\r\n\r\nHenry lifted his hand impatiently, and stopped her. \'There is such a\r\nthing as being too just and too forgiving!\' he interposed. \'I can\'t\r\nbear to hear you talk in that patient way, after the scandalously cruel\r\nmanner in which you have been treated. Try to forget them both, Agnes.\r\nI wish to God I could help you to do it!\'\r\n\r\nAgnes laid her hand on his arm. \'You are very good to me, Henry; but\r\nyou don\'t quite understand me. I was thinking of myself and my trouble\r\nin quite a different way, when you came in. I was wondering whether\r\nanything which has so entirely filled my heart, and so absorbed all\r\nthat is best and truest in me, as my feeling for your brother, can\r\nreally pass away as if it had never existed. I have destroyed the last\r\nvisible things that remind me of him. In this world I shall see him no\r\nmore. But is the tie that once bound us, completely broken? Am I as\r\nentirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had\r\nnever met and never loved? What do you think, Henry? I can hardly\r\nbelieve it.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you could bring the retribution on him that he has deserved,\' Henry\r\nWestwick answered sternly, \'I might be inclined to agree with you.\'\r\n\r\nAs that reply passed his lips, the old nurse appeared again at the\r\ndoor, announcing another visitor.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sorry to disturb you, my dear. But here is little Mrs. Ferrari\r\nwanting to know when she may say a few words to you.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes turned to Henry, before she replied. \'You remember Emily\r\nBidwell, my favourite pupil years ago at the village school, and\r\nafterwards my maid? She left me, to marry an Italian courier, named\r\nFerrari--and I am afraid it has not turned out very well. Do you mind\r\nmy having her in here for a minute or two?\'\r\n\r\nHenry rose to take his leave. \'I should be glad to see Emily again at\r\nany other time,\' he said. \'But it is best that I should go now. My\r\nmind is disturbed, Agnes; I might say things to you, if I stayed here\r\nany longer, which--which are better not said now. I shall cross the\r\nChannel by the mail to-night, and see how a few weeks\' change will help\r\nme.\' He took her hand. \'Is there anything in the world that I can do\r\nfor you?\' he asked very earnestly. She thanked him, and tried to\r\nrelease her hand. He held it with a tremulous lingering grasp. \'God\r\nbless you, Agnes!\' he said in faltering tones, with his eyes on the\r\nground. Her face flushed again, and the next instant turned paler than\r\never; she knew his heart as well as he knew it himself--she was too\r\ndistressed to speak. He lifted her hand to his lips, kissed it\r\nfervently, and, without looking at her again, left the room. The nurse\r\nhobbled after him to the head of the stairs: she had not forgotten the\r\ntime when the younger brother had been the unsuccessful rival of the\r\nelder for the hand of Agnes. \'Don\'t be down-hearted, Master Henry,\'\r\nwhispered the old woman, with the unscrupulous common sense of persons\r\nin the lower rank of life. \'Try her again, when you come back!\'\r\n\r\nLeft alone for a few moments, Agnes took a turn in the room, trying to\r\ncompose herself. She paused before a little water-colour drawing on\r\nthe wall, which had belonged to her mother: it was her own portrait\r\nwhen she was a child. \'How much happier we should be,\' she thought to\r\nherself sadly, \'if we never grew up!\'\r\n\r\nThe courier\'s wife was shown in--a little meek melancholy woman, with\r\nwhite eyelashes, and watery eyes, who curtseyed deferentially and was\r\ntroubled with a small chronic cough. Agnes shook hands with her\r\nkindly. \'Well, Emily, what can I do for you?\'\r\n\r\nThe courier\'s wife made rather a strange answer: \'I\'m afraid to tell\r\nyou, Miss.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it such a very difficult favour to grant? Sit down, and let me\r\nhear how you are going on. Perhaps the petition will slip out while we\r\nare talking. How does your husband behave to you?\'\r\n\r\nEmily\'s light grey eyes looked more watery than ever. She shook her\r\nhead and sighed resignedly. \'I have no positive complaint to make\r\nagainst him, Miss. But I\'m afraid he doesn\'t care about me; and he\r\nseems to take no interest in his home--I may almost say he\'s tired of\r\nhis home. It might be better for both of us, Miss, if he went\r\ntravelling for a while--not to mention the money, which is beginning to\r\nbe wanted sadly.\' She put her handkerchief to her eyes, and sighed\r\nagain more resignedly than ever.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t quite understand,\' said Agnes. \'I thought your husband had an\r\nengagement to take some ladies to Switzerland and Italy?\'\r\n\r\n\'That was his ill-luck, Miss. One of the ladies fell ill--and the\r\nothers wouldn\'t go without her. They paid him a month\'s salary as\r\ncompensation. But they had engaged him for the autumn and winter--and\r\nthe loss is serious.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry to hear it, Emily. Let us hope he will soon have another\r\nchance.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not his turn, Miss, to be recommended when the next applications\r\ncome to the couriers\' office. You see, there are so many of them out\r\nof employment just now. If he could be privately recommended--\' She\r\nstopped, and left the unfinished sentence to speak for itself.\r\n\r\nAgnes understood her directly. \'You want my recommendation,\' she\r\nrejoined. \'Why couldn\'t you say so at once?\'\r\n\r\nEmily blushed. \'It would be such a chance for my husband,\' she\r\nanswered confusedly. \'A letter, inquiring for a good courier (a six\r\nmonths\' engagement, Miss!) came to the office this morning. It\'s\r\nanother man\'s turn to be chosen--and the secretary will recommend him.\r\nIf my husband could only send his testimonials by the same post--with\r\njust a word in your name, Miss--it might turn the scale, as they say.\r\nA private recommendation between gentlefolks goes so far.\' She stopped\r\nagain, and sighed again, and looked down at the carpet, as if she had\r\nsome private reason for feeling a little ashamed of herself.\r\n\r\nAgnes began to be rather weary of the persistent tone of mystery in\r\nwhich her visitor spoke. \'If you want my interest with any friend of\r\nmine,\' she said, \'why can\'t you tell me the name?\'\r\n\r\nThe courier\'s wife began to cry. \'I\'m ashamed to tell you, Miss.\'\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Agnes spoke sharply. \'Nonsense, Emily! Tell me\r\nthe name directly--or drop the subject--whichever you like best.\'\r\n\r\nEmily made a last desperate effort. She wrung her handkerchief hard in\r\nher lap, and let off the name as if she had been letting off a loaded\r\ngun:--\'Lord Montbarry!\'\r\n\r\nAgnes rose and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\'You have disappointed me,\' she said very quietly, but with a look\r\nwhich the courier\'s wife had never seen in her face before. \'Knowing\r\nwhat you know, you ought to be aware that it is impossible for me to\r\ncommunicate with Lord Montbarry. I always supposed you had some\r\ndelicacy of feeling. I am sorry to find that I have been mistaken.\'\r\n\r\nWeak as she was, Emily had spirit enough to feel the reproof. She\r\nwalked in her meek noiseless way to the door. \'I beg your pardon,\r\nMiss. I am not quite so bad as you think me. But I beg your pardon,\r\nall the same.\'\r\n\r\nShe opened the door. Agnes called her back. There was something in\r\nthe woman\'s apology that appealed irresistibly to her just and generous\r\nnature. \'Come,\' she said; \'we must not part in this way. Let me not\r\nmisunderstand you. What is it that you expected me to do?\'\r\n\r\nEmily was wise enough to answer this time without any reserve. \'My\r\nhusband will send his testimonials, Miss, to Lord Montbarry in\r\nScotland. I only wanted you to let him say in his letter that his wife\r\nhas been known to you since she was a child, and that you feel some\r\nlittle interest in his welfare on that account. I don\'t ask it now,\r\nMiss. You have made me understand that I was wrong.\'\r\n\r\nHad she really been wrong? Past remembrances, as well as present\r\ntroubles, pleaded powerfully with Agnes for the courier\'s wife. \'It\r\nseems only a small favour to ask,\' she said, speaking under the impulse\r\nof kindness which was the strongest impulse in her nature. \'But I am\r\nnot sure that I ought to allow my name to be mentioned in your\r\nhusband\'s letter. Let me hear again exactly what he wishes to say.\'\r\nEmily repeated the words--and then offered one of those suggestions,\r\nwhich have a special value of their own to persons unaccustomed to the\r\nuse of their pens. \'Suppose you try, Miss, how it looks in writing?\'\r\nChildish as the idea was, Agnes tried the experiment. \'If I let you\r\nmention me,\' she said, \'we must at least decide what you are to say.\'\r\nShe wrote the words in the briefest and plainest form:--\'I venture to\r\nstate that my wife has been known from her childhood to Miss Agnes\r\nLockwood, who feels some little interest in my welfare on that\r\naccount.\' Reduced to this one sentence, there was surely nothing in the\r\nreference to her name which implied that Agnes had permitted it, or\r\nthat she was even aware of it. After a last struggle with herself, she\r\nhanded the written paper to Emily. \'Your husband must copy it exactly,\r\nwithout altering anything,\' she stipulated. \'On that condition, I\r\ngrant your request.\' Emily was not only thankful--she was really\r\ntouched. Agnes hurried the little woman out of the room. \'Don\'t give\r\nme time to repent and take it back again,\' she said. Emily vanished.\r\n\r\n\'Is the tie that once bound us completely broken? Am I as entirely\r\nparted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never\r\nmet and never loved?\' Agnes looked at the clock on the mantel-piece.\r\nNot ten minutes since, those serious questions had been on her lips.\r\nIt almost shocked her to think of the common-place manner in which they\r\nhad already met with their reply. The mail of that night would appeal\r\nonce more to Montbarry\'s remembrance of her--in the choice of a servant.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the post brought a few grateful lines from Emily. Her\r\nhusband had got the place. Ferrari was engaged, for six months\r\ncertain, as Lord Montbarry\'s courier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter only one week of travelling in Scotland, my lord and my lady\r\nreturned unexpectedly to London. Introduced to the mountains and lakes\r\nof the Highlands, her ladyship positively declined to improve her\r\nacquaintance with them. When she was asked for her reason, she\r\nanswered with a Roman brevity, \'I have seen Switzerland.\'\r\n\r\nFor a week more, the newly-married couple remained in London, in the\r\nstrictest retirement. On one day in that week the nurse returned in a\r\nstate of most uncustomary excitement from an errand on which Agnes had\r\nsent her. Passing the door of a fashionable dentist, she had met Lord\r\nMontbarry himself just leaving the house. The good woman\'s report\r\ndescribed him, with malicious pleasure, as looking wretchedly ill.\r\n\'His cheeks are getting hollow, my dear, and his beard is turning grey.\r\nI hope the dentist hurt him!\'\r\n\r\nKnowing how heartily her faithful old servant hated the man who had\r\ndeserted her, Agnes made due allowance for a large infusion of\r\nexaggeration in the picture presented to her. The main impression\r\nproduced on her mind was an impression of nervous uneasiness. If she\r\ntrusted herself in the streets by daylight while Lord Montbarry\r\nremained in London, how could she be sure that his next chance-meeting\r\nmight not be a meeting with herself? She waited at home, privately\r\nashamed of her own undignified conduct, for the next two days. On the\r\nthird day the fashionable intelligence of the newspapers announced the\r\ndeparture of Lord and Lady Montbarry for Paris, on their way to Italy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari, calling the same evening, informed Agnes that her husband\r\nhad left her with all reasonable expression of conjugal kindness; his\r\ntemper being improved by the prospect of going abroad. But one other\r\nservant accompanied the travellers--Lady Montbarry\'s maid, rather a\r\nsilent, unsociable woman, so far as Emily had heard. Her ladyship\'s\r\nbrother, Baron Rivar, was already on the Continent. It had been\r\narranged that he was to meet his sister and her husband at Rome.\r\n\r\nOne by one the dull weeks succeeded each other in the life of Agnes.\r\nShe faced her position with admirable courage, seeing her friends,\r\nkeeping herself occupied in her leisure hours with reading and drawing,\r\nleaving no means untried of diverting her mind from the melancholy\r\nremembrance of the past. But she had loved too faithfully, she had\r\nbeen wounded too deeply, to feel in any adequate degree the influence\r\nof the moral remedies which she employed. Persons who met with her in\r\nthe ordinary relations of life, deceived by her outward serenity of\r\nmanner, agreed that \'Miss Lockwood seemed to be getting over her\r\ndisappointment.\' But an old friend and school companion who happened to\r\nsee her during a brief visit to London, was inexpressibly distressed by\r\nthe change that she detected in Agnes. This lady was Mrs. Westwick,\r\nthe wife of that brother of Lord Montbarry who came next to him in age,\r\nand who was described in the \'Peerage\' as presumptive heir to the\r\ntitle. He was then away, looking after his interests in some mining\r\nproperty which he possessed in America. Mrs. Westwick insisted on\r\ntaking Agnes back with her to her home in Ireland. \'Come and keep me\r\ncompany while my husband is away. My three little girls will make you\r\ntheir playfellow, and the only stranger you will meet is the governess,\r\nwhom I answer for your liking beforehand. Pack up your things, and I\r\nwill call for you to-morrow on my way to the train.\' In those hearty\r\nterms the invitation was given. Agnes thankfully accepted it. For\r\nthree happy months she lived under the roof of her friend. The girls\r\nhung round her in tears at her departure; the youngest of them wanted\r\nto go back with Agnes to London. Half in jest, half in earnest, she\r\nsaid to her old friend at parting, \'If your governess leaves you, keep\r\nthe place open for me.\' Mrs. Westwick laughed. The wiser children took\r\nit seriously, and promised to let Agnes know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very day when Miss Lockwood returned to London, she was recalled\r\nto those associations with the past which she was most anxious to\r\nforget. After the first kissings and greetings were over, the old\r\nnurse (who had been left in charge at the lodgings) had some startling\r\ninformation to communicate, derived from the courier\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\'Here has been little Mrs. Ferrari, my dear, in a dreadful state of\r\nmind, inquiring when you would be back. Her husband has left Lord\r\nMontbarry, without a word of warning--and nobody knows what has become\r\nof him.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes looked at her in astonishment. \'Are you sure of what you are\r\nsaying?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was quite sure. \'Why, Lord bless you! the news comes from\r\nthe couriers\' office in Golden Square--from the secretary, Miss Agnes,\r\nthe secretary himself!\' Hearing this, Agnes began to feel alarmed as\r\nwell as surprised. It was still early in the evening. She at once\r\nsent a message to Mrs. Ferrari, to say that she had returned.\r\n\r\nIn an hour more the courier\'s wife appeared, in a state of agitation\r\nwhich it was not easy to control. Her narrative, when she was at last\r\nable to speak connectedly, entirely confirmed the nurse\'s report of it.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing from her husband with tolerable regularity from Paris,\r\nRome, and Venice, Emily had twice written to him afterwards--and had\r\nreceived no reply. Feeling uneasy, she had gone to the office in\r\nGolden Square, to inquire if he had been heard of there. The post of\r\nthe morning had brought a letter to the secretary from a courier then\r\nat Venice. It contained startling news of Ferrari. His wife had been\r\nallowed to take a copy of it, which she now handed to Agnes to read.\r\n\r\nThe writer stated that he had recently arrived in Venice. He had\r\npreviously heard that Ferrari was with Lord and Lady Montbarry, at one\r\nof the old Venetian palaces which they had hired for a term. Being a\r\nfriend of Ferrari, he had gone to pay him a visit. Ringing at the door\r\nthat opened on the canal, and failing to make anyone hear him, he had\r\ngone round to a side entrance opening on one of the narrow lanes of\r\nVenice. Here, standing at the door (as if she was waiting for him to\r\ntry that way next), he found a pale woman with magnificent dark eyes,\r\nwho proved to be no other than Lady Montbarry herself.\r\n\r\nShe asked, in Italian, what he wanted. He answered that he wanted to\r\nsee the courier Ferrari, if it was quite convenient. She at once\r\ninformed him that Ferrari had left the palace, without assigning any\r\nreason, and without even leaving an address at which his monthly salary\r\n(then due to him) could be paid. Amazed at this reply, the courier\r\ninquired if any person had offended Ferrari, or quarrelled with him.\r\nThe lady answered, \'To my knowledge, certainly not. I am Lady\r\nMontbarry; and I can positively assure you that Ferrari was treated\r\nwith the greatest kindness in this house. We are as much astonished as\r\nyou are at his extraordinary disappearance. If you should hear of him,\r\npray let us know, so that we may at least pay him the money which is\r\ndue.\'\r\n\r\nAfter one or two more questions (quite readily answered) relating to\r\nthe date and the time of day at which Ferrari had left the palace, the\r\ncourier took his leave.\r\n\r\nHe at once entered on the necessary investigations--without the\r\nslightest result so far as Ferrari was concerned. Nobody had seen him.\r\nNobody appeared to have been taken into his confidence. Nobody knew\r\nanything (that is to say, anything of the slightest importance) even\r\nabout persons so distinguished as Lord and Lady Montbarry. It was\r\nreported that her ladyship\'s English maid had left her, before the\r\ndisappearance of Ferrari, to return to her relatives in her own\r\ncountry, and that Lady Montbarry had taken no steps to supply her\r\nplace. His lordship was described as being in delicate health. He\r\nlived in the strictest retirement--nobody was admitted to him, not even\r\nhis own countrymen. A stupid old woman was discovered who did the\r\nhousework at the palace, arriving in the morning and going away again\r\nat night. She had never seen the lost courier--she had never even seen\r\nLord Montbarry, who was then confined to his room. Her ladyship, \'a\r\nmost gracious and adorable mistress,\' was in constant attendance on her\r\nnoble husband. There was no other servant then in the house (so far as\r\nthe old woman knew) but herself. The meals were sent in from a\r\nrestaurant. My lord, it was said, disliked strangers. My lord\'s\r\nbrother-in-law, the Baron, was generally shut up in a remote part of\r\nthe palace, occupied (the gracious mistress said) with experiments in\r\nchemistry. The experiments sometimes made a nasty smell. A doctor had\r\nlatterly been called in to his lordship--an Italian doctor, long\r\nresident in Venice. Inquiries being addressed to this gentleman (a\r\nphysician of undoubted capacity and respectability), it turned out that\r\nhe also had never seen Ferrari, having been summoned to the palace (as\r\nhis memorandum book showed) at a date subsequent to the courier\'s\r\ndisappearance. The doctor described Lord Montbarry\'s malady as\r\nbronchitis. So far, there was no reason to feel any anxiety, though\r\nthe attack was a sharp one. If alarming symptoms should appear, he had\r\narranged with her ladyship to call in another physician. For the rest,\r\nit was impossible to speak too highly of my lady; night and day, she\r\nwas at her lord\'s bedside.\r\n\r\nWith these particulars began and ended the discoveries made by\r\nFerrari\'s courier-friend. The police were on the look-out for the lost\r\nman--and that was the only hope which could be held forth for the\r\npresent, to Ferrari\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of it, Miss?\' the poor woman asked eagerly. \'What\r\nwould you advise me to do?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes was at a loss how to answer her; it was an effort even to listen\r\nto what Emily was saying. The references in the courier\'s letter to\r\nMontbarry--the report of his illness, the melancholy picture of his\r\nsecluded life--had reopened the old wound. She was not even thinking\r\nof the lost Ferrari; her mind was at Venice, by the sick man\'s bedside.\r\n\r\n\'I hardly know what to say,\' she answered. \'I have had no experience\r\nin serious matters of this kind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think it would help you, Miss, if you read my husband\'s letters\r\nto me? There are only three of them--they won\'t take long to read.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes compassionately read the letters.\r\n\r\nThey were not written in a very tender tone. \'Dear Emily,\' and \'Yours\r\naffectionately\'--these conventional phrases, were the only phrases of\r\nendearment which they contained. In the first letter, Lord Montbarry\r\nwas not very favourably spoken of:--\'We leave Paris to-morrow. I don\'t\r\nmuch like my lord. He is proud and cold, and, between ourselves,\r\nstingy in money matters. I have had to dispute such trifles as a few\r\ncentimes in the hotel bill; and twice already, some sharp remarks have\r\npassed between the newly-married couple, in consequence of her\r\nladyship\'s freedom in purchasing pretty tempting things at the shops in\r\nParis. "I can\'t afford it; you must keep to your allowance." She has\r\nhad to hear those words already. For my part, I like her. She has the\r\nnice, easy foreign manners--she talks to me as if I was a human being\r\nlike herself.\'\r\n\r\nThe second letter was dated from Rome.\r\n\r\n\'My lord\'s caprices\' (Ferrari wrote) \'have kept us perpetually on the\r\nmove. He is becoming incurably restless. I suspect he is uneasy in\r\nhis mind. Painful recollections, I should say--I find him constantly\r\nreading old letters, when her ladyship is not present. We were to have\r\nstopped at Genoa, but he hurried us on. The same thing at Florence.\r\nHere, at Rome, my lady insists on resting. Her brother has met us at\r\nthis place. There has been a quarrel already (the lady\'s maid tells\r\nme) between my lord and the Baron. The latter wanted to borrow money\r\nof the former. His lordship refused in language which offended Baron\r\nRivar. My lady pacified them, and made them shake hands.\'\r\n\r\nThe third, and last letter, was from Venice.\r\n\r\n\'More of my lord\'s economy! Instead of staying at the hotel, we have\r\nhired a damp, mouldy, rambling old palace. My lady insists on having\r\nthe best suites of rooms wherever we go--and the palace comes cheaper\r\nfor a two months\' term. My lord tried to get it for longer; he says\r\nthe quiet of Venice is good for his nerves. But a foreign speculator\r\nhas secured the palace, and is going to turn it into an hotel. The\r\nBaron is still with us, and there have been more disagreements about\r\nmoney matters. I don\'t like the Baron--and I don\'t find the\r\nattractions of my lady grow on me. She was much nicer before the Baron\r\njoined us. My lord is a punctual paymaster; it\'s a matter of honour\r\nwith him; he hates parting with his money, but he does it because he\r\nhas given his word. I receive my salary regularly at the end of each\r\nmonth--not a franc extra, though I have done many things which are not\r\npart of a courier\'s proper work. Fancy the Baron trying to borrow\r\nmoney of me! he is an inveterate gambler. I didn\'t believe it when my\r\nlady\'s maid first told me so--but I have seen enough since to satisfy\r\nme that she was right. I have seen other things besides, which--well!\r\nwhich don\'t increase my respect for my lady and the Baron. The maid\r\nsays she means to give warning to leave. She is a respectable British\r\nfemale, and doesn\'t take things quite so easily as I do. It is a dull\r\nlife here. No going into company--no company at home--not a creature\r\nsees my lord--not even the consul, or the banker. When he goes out, he\r\ngoes alone, and generally towards nightfall. Indoors, he shuts himself\r\nup in his own room with his books, and sees as little of his wife and\r\nthe Baron as possible. I fancy things are coming to a crisis here. If\r\nmy lord\'s suspicions are once awakened, the consequences will be\r\nterrible. Under certain provocations, the noble Montbarry is a man who\r\nwould stick at nothing. However, the pay is good--and I can\'t afford\r\nto talk of leaving the place, like my lady\'s maid.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes handed back the letters--so suggestive of the penalty paid\r\nalready for his own infatuation by the man who had deserted her!--with\r\nfeelings of shame and distress, which made her no fit counsellor for\r\nthe helpless woman who depended on her advice.\r\n\r\n\'The one thing I can suggest,\' she said, after first speaking some kind\r\nwords of comfort and hope, \'is that we should consult a person of\r\ngreater experience than ours. Suppose I write and ask my lawyer (who\r\nis also my friend and trustee) to come and advise us to-morrow after\r\nhis business hours?\'\r\n\r\nEmily eagerly and gratefully accepted the suggestion. An hour was\r\narranged for the meeting on the next day; the correspondence was left\r\nunder the care of Agnes; and the courier\'s wife took her leave.\r\n\r\nWeary and heartsick, Agnes lay down on the sofa, to rest and compose\r\nherself. The careful nurse brought in a reviving cup of tea. Her\r\nquaint gossip about herself and her occupations while Agnes had been\r\naway, acted as a relief to her mistress\'s overburdened mind. They were\r\nstill talking quietly, when they were startled by a loud knock at the\r\nhouse door. Hurried footsteps ascended the stairs. The door of the\r\nsitting-room was thrown open violently; the courier\'s wife rushed in\r\nlike a mad woman. \'He\'s dead! They\'ve murdered him!\' Those wild\r\nwords were all she could say. She dropped on her knees at the foot of\r\nthe sofa--held out her hand with something clasped in it--and fell back\r\nin a swoon.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, signing to Agnes to open the window, took the necessary\r\nmeasures to restore the fainting woman. \'What\'s this?\' she exclaimed.\r\n\'Here\'s a letter in her hand. See what it is, Miss.\'\r\n\r\nThe open envelope was addressed (evidently in a feigned hand-writing)\r\nto \'Mrs. Ferrari.\' The post-mark was \'Venice.\' The contents of the\r\nenvelope were a sheet of foreign note-paper, and a folded enclosure.\r\n\r\nOn the note-paper, one line only was written. It was again in a\r\nfeigned handwriting, and it contained these words:\r\n\r\n\'To console you for the loss of your husband\'\r\n\r\nAgnes opened the enclosure next.\r\n\r\nIt was a Bank of England note for a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the friend and legal adviser of Agnes Lockwood, Mr. Troy,\r\ncalled on her by appointment in the evening.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari--still persisting in the conviction of her husband\'s\r\ndeath--had sufficiently recovered to be present at the consultation.\r\nAssisted by Agnes, she told the lawyer the little that was known\r\nrelating to Ferrari\'s disappearance, and then produced the\r\ncorrespondence connected with that event. Mr. Troy read (first) the\r\nthree letters addressed by Ferrari to his wife; (secondly) the letter\r\nwritten by Ferrari\'s courier-friend, describing his visit to the palace\r\nand his interview with Lady Montbarry; and (thirdly) the one line of\r\nanonymous writing which had accompanied the extraordinary gift of a\r\nthousand pounds to Ferrari\'s wife.\r\n\r\nWell known, at a later period, as the lawyer who acted for Lady\r\nLydiard, in the case of theft, generally described as the case of \'My\r\nLady\'s Money,\' Mr. Troy was not only a man of learning and experience\r\nin his profession--he was also a man who had seen something of society\r\nat home and abroad. He possessed a keen eye for character, a quaint\r\nhumour, and a kindly nature which had not been deteriorated even by a\r\nlawyer\'s professional experience of mankind. With all these personal\r\nadvantages, it is a question, nevertheless, whether he was the fittest\r\nadviser whom Agnes could have chosen under the circumstances. Little\r\nMrs. Ferrari, with many domestic merits, was an essentially commonplace\r\nwoman. Mr. Troy was the last person living who was likely to attract\r\nher sympathies--he was the exact opposite of a commonplace man.\r\n\r\n\'She looks very ill, poor thing!\' In these words the lawyer opened the\r\nbusiness of the evening, referring to Mrs. Ferrari as unceremoniously\r\nas if she had been out of the room.\r\n\r\n\'She has suffered a terrible shock,\' Agnes answered.\r\n\r\nMr. Troy turned to Mrs. Ferrari, and looked at her again, with the\r\ninterest due to the victim of a shock. He drummed absently with his\r\nfingers on the table. At last he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\'My good lady, you don\'t really believe that your husband is dead?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari put her handkerchief to her eyes. The word \'dead\' was\r\nineffectual to express her feelings. \'Murdered!\' she said sternly,\r\nbehind her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'Why? And by whom?\' Mr. Troy asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari seemed to have some difficulty in answering. \'You have\r\nread my husband\'s letters, sir,\' she began. \'I believe he\r\ndiscovered--\' She got as far as that, and there she stopped.\r\n\r\n\'What did he discover?\'\r\n\r\nThere are limits to human patience--even the patience of a bereaved\r\nwife. This cool question irritated Mrs. Ferrari into expressing\r\nherself plainly at last.\r\n\r\n\'He discovered Lady Montbarry and the Baron!\' she answered, with a\r\nburst of hysterical vehemence. \'The Baron is no more that vile woman\'s\r\nbrother than I am. The wickedness of those two wretches came to my\r\npoor dear husband\'s knowledge. The lady\'s maid left her place on\r\naccount of it. If Ferrari had gone away too, he would have been alive\r\nat this moment. They have killed him. I say they have killed him, to\r\nprevent it from getting to Lord Montbarry\'s ears.\' So, in short sharp\r\nsentences, and in louder and louder accents, Mrs. Ferrari stated her\r\nopinion of the case.\r\n\r\nStill keeping his own view in reserve, Mr. Troy listened with an\r\nexpression of satirical approval.\r\n\r\n\'Very strongly stated, Mrs. Ferrari,\' he said. \'You build up your\r\nsentences well; you clinch your conclusions in a workmanlike manner.\r\nIf you had been a man, you would have made a good lawyer--you would\r\nhave taken juries by the scruff of their necks. Complete the case, my\r\ngood lady--complete the case. Tell us next who sent you this letter,\r\nenclosing the bank-note. The "two wretches" who murdered Mr. Ferrari\r\nwould hardly put their hands in their pockets and send you a thousand\r\npounds. Who is it--eh? I see the post-mark on the letter is "Venice."\r\nHave you any friend in that interesting city, with a large heart, and a\r\npurse to correspond, who has been let into the secret and who wishes to\r\nconsole you anonymously?\'\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to reply to this. Mrs. Ferrari began to feel the first\r\ninward approaches of something like hatred towards Mr. Troy. \'I don\'t\r\nunderstand you, sir,\' she answered. \'I don\'t think this is a joking\r\nmatter.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes interfered, for the first time. She drew her chair a little\r\nnearer to her legal counsellor and friend.\r\n\r\n\'What is the most probable explanation, in your opinion?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'I shall offend Mrs. Ferrari if I tell you,\' Mr. Troy answered.\r\n\r\n\'No, sir, you won\'t!\' cried Mrs. Ferrari, hating Mr. Troy undisguisedly\r\nby this time.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer leaned back in his chair. \'Very well,\' he said, in his most\r\ngood-humoured manner. \'Let\'s have it out. Observe, madam, I don\'t\r\ndispute your view of the position of affairs at the palace in Venice.\r\nYou have your husband\'s letters to justify you; and you have also the\r\nsignificant fact that Lady Montbarry\'s maid did really leave the house.\r\nWe will say, then, that Lord Montbarry has presumably been made the\r\nvictim of a foul wrong--that Mr. Ferrari was the first to find it\r\nout--and that the guilty persons had reason to fear, not only that he\r\nwould acquaint Lord Montbarry with his discovery, but that he would be\r\na principal witness against them if the scandal was made public in a\r\ncourt of law. Now mark! Admitting all this, I draw a totally\r\ndifferent conclusion from the conclusion at which you have arrived.\r\nHere is your husband left in this miserable household of three, under\r\nvery awkward circumstances for him. What does he do? But for the\r\nbank-note and the written message sent to you with it, I should say\r\nthat he had wisely withdrawn himself from association with a\r\ndisgraceful discovery and exposure, by taking secretly to flight. The\r\nmoney modifies this view--unfavourably so far as Mr. Ferrari is\r\nconcerned. I still believe he is keeping out of the way. But I now\r\nsay he is paid for keeping out of the way--and that bank-note there on\r\nthe table is the price of his absence, sent by the guilty persons to\r\nhis wife.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari\'s watery grey eyes brightened suddenly; Mrs. Ferrari\'s\r\ndull drab-coloured complexion became enlivened by a glow of brilliant\r\nred.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s false!\' she cried. \'It\'s a burning shame to speak of my husband\r\nin that way!\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you I should offend you!\' said Mr. Troy.\r\n\r\nAgnes interposed once more--in the interests of peace. She took the\r\noffended wife\'s hand; she appealed to the lawyer to reconsider that\r\nside of his theory which reflected harshly on Ferrari. While she was\r\nstill speaking, the servant interrupted her by entering the room with a\r\nvisiting-card. It was the card of Henry Westwick; and there was an\r\nominous request written on it in pencil. \'I bring bad news. Let me\r\nsee you for a minute downstairs.\' Agnes immediately left the room.\r\n\r\nAlone with Mrs. Ferrari, Mr. Troy permitted his natural kindness of\r\nheart to show itself on the surface at last. He tried to make his\r\npeace with the courier\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\'You have every claim, my good soul, to resent a reflection cast upon\r\nyour husband,\' he began. \'I may even say that I respect you for\r\nspeaking so warmly in his defence. At the same time, remember, that I\r\nam bound, in such a serious matter as this, to tell you what is really\r\nin my mind. I can have no intention of offending you, seeing that I am\r\na total stranger to you and to Mr. Ferrari. A thousand pounds is a\r\nlarge sum of money; and a poor man may excusably be tempted by it to do\r\nnothing worse than to keep out of the way for a while. My only\r\ninterest, acting on your behalf, is to get at the truth. If you will\r\ngive me time, I see no reason to despair of finding your husband yet.\'\r\n\r\nFerrari\'s wife listened, without being convinced: her narrow little\r\nmind, filled to its extreme capacity by her unfavourable opinion of Mr.\r\nTroy, had no room left for the process of correcting its first\r\nimpression. \'I am much obliged to you, sir,\' was all she said. Her\r\neyes were more communicative--her eyes added, in their language, \'You\r\nmay say what you please; I will never forgive you to my dying day.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Troy gave it up. He composedly wheeled his chair around, put his\r\nhands in his pockets, and looked out of window.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of silence, the drawing-room door was opened.\r\n\r\nMr. Troy wheeled round again briskly to the table, expecting to see\r\nAgnes. To his surprise there appeared, in her place, a perfect\r\nstranger to him--a gentleman, in the prime of life, with a marked\r\nexpression of pain and embarrassment on his handsome face. He looked\r\nat Mr. Troy, and bowed gravely.\r\n\r\n\'I am so unfortunate as to have brought news to Miss Agnes Lockwood\r\nwhich has greatly distressed her,\' he said. \'She has retired to her\r\nroom. I am requested to make her excuses, and to speak to you in her\r\nplace.\'\r\n\r\nHaving introduced himself in those terms, he noticed Mrs. Ferrari, and\r\nheld out his hand to her kindly. \'It is some years since we last met,\r\nEmily,\' he said. \'I am afraid you have almost forgotten the "Master\r\nHenry" of old times.\' Emily, in some little confusion, made her\r\nacknowledgments, and begged to know if she could be of any use to Miss\r\nLockwood. \'The old nurse is with her,\' Henry answered; \'they will be\r\nbetter left together.\' He turned once more to Mr. Troy. \'I ought to\r\ntell you,\' he said, \'that my name is Henry Westwick. I am the younger\r\nbrother of the late Lord Montbarry.\'\r\n\r\n\'The late Lord Montbarry!\' Mr. Troy exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'My brother died at Venice yesterday evening. There is the telegram.\'\r\nWith that startling answer, he handed the paper to Mr. Troy.\r\n\r\nThe message was in these words:\r\n\r\n\'Lady Montbarry, Venice. To Stephen Robert Westwick, Newbury\'s Hotel,\r\nLondon. It is useless to take the journey. Lord Montbarry died of\r\nbronchitis, at 8.40 this evening. All needful details by post.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was this expected, sir?\' the lawyer asked.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot say that it has taken us entirely by surprise,\' Henry\r\nanswered. \'My brother Stephen (who is now the head of the family)\r\nreceived a telegram three days since, informing him that alarming\r\nsymptoms had declared themselves, and that a second physician had been\r\ncalled in. He telegraphed back to say that he had left Ireland for\r\nLondon, on his way to Venice, and to direct that any further message\r\nmight be sent to his hotel. The reply came in a second telegram. It\r\nannounced that Lord Montbarry was in a state of insensibility, and\r\nthat, in his brief intervals of consciousness, he recognised nobody.\r\nMy brother was advised to wait in London for later information. The\r\nthird telegram is now in your hands. That is all I know, up to the\r\npresent time.\'\r\n\r\nHappening to look at the courier\'s wife, Mr. Troy was struck by the\r\nexpression of blank fear which showed itself in the woman\'s face.\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Ferrari,\' he said, \'have you heard what Mr. Westwick has just\r\ntold me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Every word of it, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you any questions to ask?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'You seem to be alarmed,\' the lawyer persisted. \'Is it still about\r\nyour husband?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never see my husband again, sir. I have thought so all along,\r\nas you know. I feel sure of it now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sure of it, after what you have just heard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can you tell me why?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir. It\'s a feeling I have. I can\'t tell why.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, a feeling?\' Mr. Troy repeated, in a tone of compassionate\r\ncontempt. \'When it comes to feelings, my good soul--!\' He left the\r\nsentence unfinished, and rose to take his leave of Mr. Westwick. The\r\ntruth is, he began to feel puzzled himself, and he did not choose to\r\nlet Mrs. Ferrari see it. \'Accept the expression of my sympathy, sir,\'\r\nhe said to Mr. Westwick politely. \'I wish you good evening.\'\r\n\r\nHenry turned to Mrs. Ferrari as the lawyer closed the door. \'I have\r\nheard of your trouble, Emily, from Miss Lockwood. Is there anything I\r\ncan do to help you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing, sir, thank you. Perhaps, I had better go home after what has\r\nhappened? I will call to-morrow, and see if I can be of any use to\r\nMiss Agnes. I am very sorry for her.\' She stole away, with her formal\r\ncurtsey, her noiseless step, and her obstinate resolution to take the\r\ngloomiest view of her husband\'s case.\r\n\r\nHenry Westwick looked round him in the solitude of the little\r\ndrawing-room. There was nothing to keep him in the house, and yet he\r\nlingered in it. It was something to be even near Agnes--to see the\r\nthings belonging to her that were scattered about the room. There, in\r\nthe corner, was her chair, with her embroidery on the work-table by its\r\nside. On the little easel near the window was her last drawing, not\r\nquite finished yet. The book she had been reading lay on the sofa,\r\nwith her tiny pencil-case in it to mark the place at which she had left\r\noff. One after another, he looked at the objects that reminded him of\r\nthe woman whom he loved--took them up tenderly--and laid them down\r\nagain with a sigh. Ah, how far, how unattainably far from him, she was\r\nstill! \'She will never forget Montbarry,\' he thought to himself as he\r\ntook up his hat to go. \'Not one of us feels his death as she feels it.\r\nMiserable, miserable wretch--how she loved him!\'\r\n\r\nIn the street, as Henry closed the house-door, he was stopped by a\r\npassing acquaintance--a wearisome inquisitive man--doubly unwelcome to\r\nhim, at that moment. \'Sad news, Westwick, this about your brother.\r\nRather an unexpected death, wasn\'t it? We never heard at the club that\r\nMontbarry\'s lungs were weak. What will the insurance offices do?\'\r\n\r\nHenry started; he had never thought of his brother\'s life insurance.\r\nWhat could the offices do but pay? A death by bronchitis, certified by\r\ntwo physicians, was surely the least disputable of all deaths. \'I wish\r\nyou hadn\'t put that question into my head!\' he broke out irritably.\r\n\'Ah!\' said his friend, \'you think the widow will get the money? So do\r\nI! so do I!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nSome days later, the insurance offices (two in number) received the\r\nformal announcement of Lord Montbarry\'s death, from her ladyship\'s\r\nLondon solicitors. The sum insured in each office was five thousand\r\npounds--on which one year\'s premium only had been paid. In the face of\r\nsuch a pecuniary emergency as this, the Directors thought it desirable\r\nto consider their position. The medical advisers of the two offices,\r\nwho had recommended the insurance of Lord Montbarry\'s life, were called\r\ninto council over their own reports. The result excited some interest\r\namong persons connected with the business of life insurance. Without\r\nabsolutely declining to pay the money, the two offices (acting in\r\nconcert) decided on sending a commission of inquiry to Venice, \'for the\r\npurpose of obtaining further information.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Troy received the earliest intelligence of what was going on. He\r\nwrote at once to communicate his news to Agnes; adding, what he\r\nconsidered to be a valuable hint, in these words:\r\n\r\n\'You are intimately acquainted, I know, with Lady Barville, the late\r\nLord Montbarry\'s eldest sister. The solicitors employed by her husband\r\nare also the solicitors to one of the two insurance offices. There may\r\npossibly be something in the report of the commission of inquiry\r\ntouching on Ferrari\'s disappearance. Ordinary persons would not be\r\npermitted, of course, to see such a document. But a sister of the late\r\nlord is so near a relative as to be an exception to general rules. If\r\nSir Theodore Barville puts it on that footing, the lawyers, even if\r\nthey do not allow his wife to look at the report, will at least answer\r\nany discreet questions she may ask referring to it. Let me hear what\r\nyou think of this suggestion, at your earliest convenience.\'\r\n\r\nThe reply was received by return of post. Agnes declined to avail\r\nherself of Mr. Troy\'s proposal.\r\n\r\n\'My interference, innocent as it was,\' she wrote, \'has already been\r\nproductive of such deplorable results, that I cannot and dare not stir\r\nany further in the case of Ferrari. If I had not consented to let that\r\nunfortunate man refer to me by name, the late Lord Montbarry would\r\nnever have engaged him, and his wife would have been spared the misery\r\nand suspense from which she is suffering now. I would not even look at\r\nthe report to which you allude if it was placed in my hands--I have\r\nheard more than enough already of that hideous life in the palace at\r\nVenice. If Mrs. Ferrari chooses to address herself to Lady Barville\r\n(with your assistance), that is of course quite another thing. But,\r\neven in this case, I must make it a positive condition that my name\r\nshall not be mentioned. Forgive me, dear Mr. Troy! I am very unhappy,\r\nand very unreasonable--but I am only a woman, and you must not expect\r\ntoo much from me.\'\r\n\r\nFoiled in this direction, the lawyer next advised making the attempt to\r\ndiscover the present address of Lady Montbarry\'s English maid. This\r\nexcellent suggestion had one drawback: it could only be carried out by\r\nspending money--and there was no money to spend. Mrs. Ferrari shrank\r\nfrom the bare idea of making any use of the thousand-pound note. It\r\nhad been deposited in the safe keeping of a bank. If it was even\r\nmentioned in her hearing, she shuddered and referred to it, with\r\nmelodramatic fervour, as \'my husband\'s blood-money!\'\r\n\r\nSo, under stress of circumstances, the attempt to solve the mystery of\r\nFerrari\'s disappearance was suspended for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last month of the year 1860. The commission of inquiry was\r\nalready at work; having begun its investigations on December 6. On the\r\n10th, the term for which the late Lord Montbarry had hired the Venetian\r\npalace, expired. News by telegram reached the insurance offices that\r\nLady Montbarry had been advised by her lawyers to leave for London with\r\nas little delay as possible. Baron Rivar, it was believed, would\r\naccompany her to England, but would not remain in that country, unless\r\nhis services were absolutely required by her ladyship. The Baron,\r\n\'well known as an enthusiastic student of chemistry,\' had heard of\r\ncertain recent discoveries in connection with that science in the\r\nUnited States, and was anxious to investigate them personally.\r\n\r\nThese items of news, collected by Mr. Troy, were duly communicated to\r\nMrs. Ferrari, whose anxiety about her husband made her a frequent, a\r\ntoo frequent, visitor at the lawyer\'s office. She attempted to relate\r\nwhat she had heard to her good friend and protectress. Agnes steadily\r\nrefused to listen, and positively forbade any further conversation\r\nrelating to Lord Montbarry\'s wife, now that Lord Montbarry was no more.\r\n\'You have Mr. Troy to advise you,\' she said; \'and you are welcome to\r\nwhat little money I can spare, if money is wanted. All I ask in return\r\nis that you will not distress me. I am trying to separate myself from\r\nremembrances--\' her voice faltered; she paused to control\r\nherself--\'from remembrances,\' she resumed, \'which are sadder than ever\r\nsince I have heard of Lord Montbarry\'s death. Help me by your silence\r\nto recover my spirits, if I can. Let me hear nothing more, until I can\r\nrejoice with you that your husband is found.\'\r\n\r\nTime advanced to the 13th of the month; and more information of the\r\ninteresting sort reached Mr. Troy. The labours of the insurance\r\ncommission had come to an end--the report had been received from Venice\r\non that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 14th the Directors and their legal advisers met for the reading\r\nof the report, with closed doors. These were the terms in which the\r\nCommissioners related the results of their inquiry: \'Private and\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\n\'We have the honour to inform our Directors that we arrived in Venice\r\non December 6, 1860. On the same day we proceeded to the palace\r\ninhabited by Lord Montbarry at the time of his last illness and death.\r\n\r\n\'We were received with all possible courtesy by Lady Montbarry\'s\r\nbrother, Baron Rivar. "My sister was her husband\'s only attendant\r\nthroughout his illness," the Baron informed us. "She is overwhelmed by\r\ngrief and fatigue--or she would have been here to receive you\r\npersonally. What are your wishes, gentlemen? and what can I do for you\r\nin her ladyship\'s place?"\r\n\r\n\'In accordance with our instructions, we answered that the death and\r\nburial of Lord Montbarry abroad made it desirable to obtain more\r\ncomplete information relating to his illness, and to the circumstances\r\nwhich had attended it, than could be conveyed in writing. We explained\r\nthat the law provided for the lapse of a certain interval of time\r\nbefore the payment of the sum assured, and we expressed our wish to\r\nconduct the inquiry with the most respectful consideration for her\r\nladyship\'s feelings, and for the convenience of any other members of\r\nthe family inhabiting the house.\r\n\r\n\'To this the Baron replied, "I am the only member of the family living\r\nhere, and I and the palace are entirely at your disposal." From first\r\nto last we found this gentleman perfectly straightforward, and most\r\namiably willing to assist us.\r\n\r\n\'With the one exception of her ladyship\'s room, we went over the whole\r\nof the palace the same day. It is an immense place only partially\r\nfurnished. The first floor and part of the second floor were the\r\nportions of it that had been inhabited by Lord Montbarry and the\r\nmembers of the household. We saw the bedchamber, at one extremity of\r\nthe palace, in which his lordship died, and the small room\r\ncommunicating with it, which he used as a study. Next to this was a\r\nlarge apartment or hall, the doors of which he habitually kept locked,\r\nhis object being (as we were informed) to pursue his studies\r\nuninterruptedly in perfect solitude. On the other side of the large\r\nhall were the bedchamber occupied by her ladyship, and the\r\ndressing-room in which the maid slept previous to her departure for\r\nEngland. Beyond these were the dining and reception rooms, opening\r\ninto an antechamber, which gave access to the grand staircase of the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n\'The only inhabited rooms on the second floor were the sitting-room and\r\nbedroom occupied by Baron Rivar, and another room at some distance from\r\nit, which had been the bedroom of the courier Ferrari.\r\n\r\n\'The rooms on the third floor and on the basement were completely\r\nunfurnished, and in a condition of great neglect. We inquired if there\r\nwas anything to be seen below the basement--and we were at once\r\ninformed that there were vaults beneath, which we were at perfect\r\nliberty to visit.\r\n\r\n\'We went down, so as to leave no part of the palace unexplored. The\r\nvaults were, it was believed, used as dungeons in the old times--say,\r\nsome centuries since. Air and light were only partially admitted to\r\nthese dismal places by two long shafts of winding construction, which\r\ncommunicated with the back yard of the palace, and the openings of\r\nwhich, high above the ground, were protected by iron gratings. The\r\nstone stairs leading down into the vaults could be closed at will by a\r\nheavy trap-door in the back hall, which we found open. The Baron\r\nhimself led the way down the stairs. We remarked that it might be\r\nawkward if that trap-door fell down and closed the opening behind us.\r\nThe Baron smiled at the idea. "Don\'t be alarmed, gentlemen," he said;\r\n"the door is safe. I had an interest in seeing to it myself, when we\r\nfirst inhabited the palace. My favourite study is the study of\r\nexperimental chemistry--and my workshop, since we have been in Venice,\r\nis down here."\r\n\r\n\'These last words explained a curious smell in the vaults, which we\r\nnoticed the moment we entered them. We can only describe the smell by\r\nsaying that it was of a twofold sort--faintly aromatic, as it were, in\r\nits first effect, but with some after-odour very sickening in our\r\nnostrils. The Baron\'s furnaces and retorts, and other things, were all\r\nthere to speak for themselves, together with some packages of\r\nchemicals, having the name and address of the person who had supplied\r\nthem plainly visible on their labels. "Not a pleasant place for\r\nstudy," Baron Rivar observed, "but my sister is timid. She has a\r\nhorror of chemical smells and explosions--and she has banished me to\r\nthese lower regions, so that my experiments may neither be smelt nor\r\nheard." He held out his hands, on which we had noticed that he wore\r\ngloves in the house. "Accidents will happen sometimes," he said, "no\r\nmatter how careful a man may be. I burnt my hands severely in trying a\r\nnew combination the other day, and they are only recovering now."\r\n\r\n\'We mention these otherwise unimportant incidents, in order to show\r\nthat our exploration of the palace was not impeded by any attempt at\r\nconcealment. We were even admitted to her ladyship\'s own room--on a\r\nsubsequent occasion, when she went out to take the air. Our\r\ninstructions recommended us to examine his lordship\'s residence,\r\nbecause the extreme privacy of his life at Venice, and the remarkable\r\ndeparture of the only two servants in the house, might have some\r\nsuspicious connection with the nature of his death. We found nothing\r\nto justify suspicion.\r\n\r\n\'As to his lordship\'s retired way of life, we have conversed on the\r\nsubject with the consul and the banker--the only two strangers who held\r\nany communication with him. He called once at the bank to obtain money\r\non his letter of credit, and excused himself from accepting an\r\ninvitation to visit the banker at his private residence, on the ground\r\nof delicate health. His lordship wrote to the same effect on sending\r\nhis card to the consul, to excuse himself from personally returning\r\nthat gentleman\'s visit to the palace. We have seen the letter, and we\r\nbeg to offer the following copy of it. "Many years passed in India\r\nhave injured my constitution. I have ceased to go into society; the\r\none occupation of my life now is the study of Oriental literature. The\r\nair of Italy is better for me than the air of England, or I should\r\nnever have left home. Pray accept the apologies of a student and an\r\ninvalid. The active part of my life is at an end." The self-seclusion\r\nof his lordship seems to us to be explained in these brief lines. We\r\nhave not, however, on that account spared our inquiries in other\r\ndirections. Nothing to excite a suspicion of anything wrong has come\r\nto our knowledge.\r\n\r\n\'As to the departure of the lady\'s maid, we have seen the woman\'s\r\nreceipt for her wages, in which it is expressly stated that she left\r\nLady Montbarry\'s service because she disliked the Continent, and wished\r\nto get back to her own country. This is not an uncommon result of\r\ntaking English servants to foreign parts. Lady Montbarry has informed\r\nus that she abstained from engaging another maid in consequence of the\r\nextreme dislike which his lordship expressed to having strangers in the\r\nhouse, in the state of his health at that time.\r\n\r\n\'The disappearance of the courier Ferrari is, in itself, unquestionably\r\na suspicious circumstance. Neither her ladyship nor the Baron can\r\nexplain it; and no investigation that we could make has thrown the\r\nsmallest light on this event, or has justified us in associating it,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, with the object of our inquiry. We have even\r\ngone the length of examining the portmanteau which Ferrari left behind\r\nhim. It contains nothing but clothes and linen--no money, and not even\r\na scrap of paper in the pockets of the clothes. The portmanteau\r\nremains in charge of the police.\r\n\r\n\'We have also found opportunities of speaking privately to the old\r\nwoman who attends to the rooms occupied by her ladyship and the Baron.\r\nShe was recommended to fill this situation by the keeper of the\r\nrestaurant who has supplied the meals to the family throughout the\r\nperiod of their residence at the palace. Her character is most\r\nfavourably spoken of. Unfortunately, her limited intelligence makes\r\nher of no value as a witness. We were patient and careful in\r\nquestioning her, and we found her perfectly willing to answer us; but\r\nwe could elicit nothing which is worth including in the present report.\r\n\r\n\'On the second day of our inquiries, we had the honour of an interview\r\nwith Lady Montbarry. Her ladyship looked miserably worn and ill, and\r\nseemed to be quite at a loss to understand what we wanted with her.\r\nBaron Rivar, who introduced us, explained the nature of our errand in\r\nVenice, and took pains to assure her that it was a purely formal duty\r\non which we were engaged. Having satisfied her ladyship on this point,\r\nhe discreetly left the room.\r\n\r\n\'The questions which we addressed to Lady Montbarry related mainly, of\r\ncourse, to his lordship\'s illness. The answers, given with great\r\nnervousness of manner, but without the slightest appearance of reserve,\r\ninformed us of the facts that follow:\r\n\r\n\'Lord Montbarry had been out of order for some time past--nervous and\r\nirritable. He first complained of having taken cold on November 13\r\nlast; he passed a wakeful and feverish night, and remained in bed the\r\nnext day. Her ladyship proposed sending for medical advice. He\r\nrefused to allow her to do this, saying that he could quite easily be\r\nhis own doctor in such a trifling matter as a cold. Some hot lemonade\r\nwas made at his request, with a view to producing perspiration. Lady\r\nMontbarry\'s maid having left her at that time, the courier Ferrari\r\n(then the only servant in the house) went out to buy the lemons. Her\r\nladyship made the drink with her own hands. It was successful in\r\nproducing perspiration--and Lord Montbarry had some hours of sleep\r\nafterwards. Later in the day, having need of Ferrari\'s services, Lady\r\nMontbarry rang for him. The bell was not answered. Baron Rivar\r\nsearched for the man, in the palace and out of it, in vain. From that\r\ntime forth not a trace of Ferrari could be discovered. This happened\r\non November 14.\r\n\r\n\'On the night of the 14th, the feverish symptoms accompanying his\r\nlordship\'s cold returned. They were in part perhaps attributable to\r\nthe annoyance and alarm caused by Ferrari\'s mysterious disappearance.\r\nIt had been impossible to conceal the circumstance, as his lordship\r\nrang repeatedly for the courier; insisting that the man should relieve\r\nLady Montbarry and the Baron by taking their places during the night at\r\nhis bedside.\r\n\r\n\'On the 15th (the day on which the old woman first came to do the\r\nhousework), his lordship complained of sore throat, and of a feeling of\r\noppression on the chest. On this day, and again on the 16th, her\r\nladyship and the Baron entreated him to see a doctor. He still\r\nrefused. "I don\'t want strange faces about me; my cold will run its\r\ncourse, in spite of the doctor,"--that was his answer. On the 17th he\r\nwas so much worse that it was decided to send for medical help whether\r\nhe liked it or not. Baron Rivar, after inquiry at the consul\'s,\r\nsecured the services of Doctor Bruno, well known as an eminent\r\nphysician in Venice; with the additional recommendation of having\r\nresided in England, and having made himself acquainted with English\r\nforms of medical practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Thus far our account of his lordship\'s illness has been derived from\r\nstatements made by Lady Montbarry. The narrative will now be most\r\nfitly continued in the language of the doctor\'s own report, herewith\r\nsubjoined.\r\n\r\n\'"My medical diary informs me that I first saw the English Lord\r\nMontbarry, on November 17. He was suffering from a sharp attack of\r\nbronchitis. Some precious time had been lost, through his obstinate\r\nobjection to the presence of a medical man at his bedside. Generally\r\nspeaking, he appeared to be in a delicate state of health. His nervous\r\nsystem was out of order--he was at once timid and contradictory. When\r\nI spoke to him in English, he answered in Italian; and when I tried him\r\nin Italian, he went back to English. It mattered little--the malady\r\nhad already made such progress that he could only speak a few words at\r\na time, and those in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\'"I at once applied the necessary remedies. Copies of my prescriptions\r\n(with translation into English) accompany the present statement, and\r\nare left to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\'"For the next three days I was in constant attendance on my patient.\r\nHe answered to the remedies employed--improving slowly, but decidedly.\r\nI could conscientiously assure Lady Montbarry that no danger was to be\r\napprehended thus far. She was indeed a most devoted wife. I vainly\r\nendeavoured to induce her to accept the services of a competent nurse;\r\nshe would allow nobody to attend on her husband but herself. Night and\r\nday this estimable woman was at his bedside. In her brief intervals of\r\nrepose, her brother watched the sick man in her place. This brother\r\nwas, I must say, very good company, in the intervals when we had time\r\nfor a little talk. He dabbled in chemistry, down in the horrid\r\nunder-water vaults of the palace; and he wanted to show me some of his\r\nexperiments. I have enough of chemistry in writing prescriptions--and\r\nI declined. He took it quite good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n\'"I am straying away from my subject. Let me return to the sick lord.\r\n\r\n\'"Up to the 20th, then, things went well enough. I was quite\r\nunprepared for the disastrous change that showed itself, when I paid\r\nLord Montbarry my morning visit on the 21st. He had relapsed, and\r\nseriously relapsed. Examining him to discover the cause, I found\r\nsymptoms of pneumonia--that is to say, in unmedical language,\r\ninflammation of the substance of the lungs. He breathed with\r\ndifficulty, and was only partially able to relieve himself by coughing.\r\nI made the strictest inquiries, and was assured that his medicine had\r\nbeen administered as carefully as usual, and that he had not been\r\nexposed to any changes of temperature. It was with great reluctance\r\nthat I added to Lady Montbarry\'s distress; but I felt bound, when she\r\nsuggested a consultation with another physician, to own that I too\r\nthought there was really need for it.\r\n\r\n\'"Her ladyship instructed me to spare no expense, and to get the best\r\nmedical opinion in Italy. The best opinion was happily within our\r\nreach. The first and foremost of Italian physicians is Torello of\r\nPadua. I sent a special messenger for the great man. He arrived on\r\nthe evening of the 21st, and confirmed my opinion that pneumonia had\r\nset in, and that our patient\'s life was in danger. I told him what my\r\ntreatment of the case had been, and he approved of it in every\r\nparticular. He made some valuable suggestions, and (at Lady\r\nMontbarry\'s express request) he consented to defer his return to Padua\r\nuntil the following morning.\r\n\r\n\'"We both saw the patient at intervals in the course of the night. The\r\ndisease, steadily advancing, set our utmost resistance at defiance. In\r\nthe morning Doctor Torello took his leave. \'I can be of no further\r\nuse,\' he said to me. \'The man is past all help--and he ought to know\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'"Later in the day I warned my lord, as gently as I could, that his\r\ntime had come. I am informed that there are serious reasons for my\r\nstating what passed between us on this occasion, in detail, and without\r\nany reserve. I comply with the request.\r\n\r\n\'"Lord Montbarry received the intelligence of his approaching death\r\nwith becoming composure, but with a certain doubt. He signed to me to\r\nput my ear to his mouth. He whispered faintly, \'Are you sure?\' It was\r\nno time to deceive him; I said, \'Positively sure.\' He waited a little,\r\ngasping for breath, and then he whispered again, \'Feel under my\r\npillow.\' I found under his pillow a letter, sealed and stamped, ready\r\nfor the post. His next words were just audible and no more--\'Post it\r\nyourself.\' I answered, of course, that I would do so--and I did post\r\nthe letter with my own hand. I looked at the address. It was directed\r\nto a lady in London. The street I cannot remember. The name I can\r\nperfectly recall: it was an Italian name--\'Mrs. Ferrari.\'\r\n\r\n\'"That night my lord nearly died of asphyxia. I got him through it for\r\nthe time; and his eyes showed that he understood me when I told him,\r\nthe next morning, that I had posted the letter. This was his last\r\neffort of consciousness. When I saw him again he was sunk in apathy.\r\nHe lingered in a state of insensibility, supported by stimulants, until\r\nthe 25th, and died (unconscious to the last) on the evening of that day.\r\n\r\n\'"As to the cause of his death, it seems (if I may be excused for\r\nsaying so) simply absurd to ask the question. Bronchitis, terminating\r\nin pneumonia--there is no more doubt that this, and this only, was the\r\nmalady of which he expired, than that two and two make four. Doctor\r\nTorello\'s own note of the case is added here to a duplicate of my\r\ncertificate, in order (as I am informed) to satisfy some English\r\noffices in which his lordship\'s life was insured. The English offices\r\nmust have been founded by that celebrated saint and doubter, mentioned\r\nin the New Testament, whose name was Thomas!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Doctor Bruno\'s evidence ends here.\r\n\r\n\'Reverting for a moment to our inquiries addressed to Lady Montbarry,\r\nwe have to report that she can give us no information on the subject of\r\nthe letter which the doctor posted at Lord Montbarry\'s request. When\r\nhis lordship wrote it? what it contained? why he kept it a secret from\r\nLady Montbarry (and from the Baron also); and why he should write at\r\nall to the wife of his courier? these are questions to which we find it\r\nsimply impossible to obtain any replies. It seems even useless to say\r\nthat the matter is open to suspicion. Suspicion implies conjecture of\r\nsome kind--and the letter under my lord\'s pillow baffles all\r\nconjecture. Application to Mrs. Ferrari may perhaps clear up the\r\nmystery. Her residence in London will be easily discovered at the\r\nItalian Couriers\' Office, Golden Square.\r\n\r\n\'Having arrived at the close of the present report, we have now to draw\r\nyour attention to the conclusion which is justified by the results of\r\nour investigation.\r\n\r\n\'The plain question before our Directors and ourselves appears to be\r\nthis: Has the inquiry revealed any extraordinary circumstances which\r\nrender the death of Lord Montbarry open to suspicion? The inquiry has\r\nrevealed extraordinary circumstances beyond all doubt--such as the\r\ndisappearance of Ferrari, the remarkable absence of the customary\r\nestablishment of servants in the house, and the mysterious letter which\r\nhis lordship asked the doctor to post. But where is the proof that any\r\none of these circumstances is associated--suspiciously and directly\r\nassociated--with the only event which concerns us, the event of Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s death? In the absence of any such proof, and in the face\r\nof the evidence of two eminent physicians, it is impossible to dispute\r\nthe statement on the certificate that his lordship died a natural\r\ndeath. We are bound, therefore, to report, that there are no valid\r\ngrounds for refusing the payment of the sum for which the late Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s life was assured.\r\n\r\n\'We shall send these lines to you by the post of to-morrow, December\r\n10; leaving time to receive your further instructions (if any), in\r\nreply to our telegram of this evening announcing the conclusion of the\r\ninquiry.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Now, my good creature, whatever you have to say to me, out with it at\r\nonce! I don\'t want to hurry you needlessly; but these are business\r\nhours, and I have other people\'s affairs to attend to besides yours.\'\r\n\r\nAddressing Ferrari\'s wife, with his usual blunt good-humour, in these\r\nterms, Mr. Troy registered the lapse of time by a glance at the watch\r\non his desk, and then waited to hear what his client had to say to him.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s something more, sir, about the letter with the thousand-pound\r\nnote,\' Mrs. Ferrari began. \'I have found out who sent it to me.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Troy started. \'This is news indeed!\' he said. \'Who sent you the\r\nletter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lord Montbarry sent it, sir.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to take Mr. Troy by surprise. But Mrs. Ferrari threw\r\nhim completely off his balance. For a while he could only look at her\r\nin silent surprise. \'Nonsense!\' he said, as soon as he had recovered\r\nhimself. \'There is some mistake--it can\'t be!\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no mistake,\' Mrs. Ferrari rejoined, in her most positive\r\nmanner. \'Two gentlemen from the insurance offices called on me this\r\nmorning, to see the letter. They were completely puzzled--especially\r\nwhen they heard of the bank-note inside. But they know who sent the\r\nletter. His lordship\'s doctor in Venice posted it at his lordship\'s\r\nrequest. Go to the gentlemen yourself, sir, if you don\'t believe me.\r\nThey were polite enough to ask if I could account for Lord Montbarry\'s\r\nwriting to me and sending me the money. I gave them my opinion\r\ndirectly--I said it was like his lordship\'s kindness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Like his lordship\'s kindness?\' Mr. Troy repeated, in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir! Lord Montbarry knew me, like all the other members of his\r\nfamily, when I was at school on the estate in Ireland. If he could\r\nhave done it, he would have protected my poor dear husband. But he was\r\nhelpless himself in the hands of my lady and the Baron--and the only\r\nkind thing he could do was to provide for me in my widowhood, like the\r\ntrue nobleman he was!\'\r\n\r\n\'A very pretty explanation!\' said Mr. Troy. \'What did your visitors\r\nfrom the insurance offices think of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'They asked if I had any proof of my husband\'s death.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what did you say?\'\r\n\r\n\'I said, "I give you better than proof, gentlemen; I give you my\r\npositive opinion."\'\r\n\r\n\'That satisfied them, of course?\'\r\n\r\n\'They didn\'t say so in words, sir. They looked at each other--and\r\nwished me good-morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mrs. Ferrari, unless you have some more extraordinary news for\r\nme, I think I shall wish you good-morning too. I can take a note of\r\nyour information (very startling information, I own); and, in the\r\nabsence of proof, I can do no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can provide you with proof, sir--if that is all you want,\' said Mrs.\r\nFerrari, with great dignity. \'I only wish to know, first, whether the\r\nlaw justifies me in doing it. You may have seen in the fashionable\r\nintelligence of the newspapers, that Lady Montbarry has arrived in\r\nLondon, at Newbury\'s Hotel. I propose to go and see her.\'\r\n\r\n\'The deuce you do! May I ask for what purpose?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari answered in a mysterious whisper. \'For the purpose of\r\ncatching her in a trap! I shan\'t send in my name--I shall announce\r\nmyself as a person on business, and the first words I say to her will\r\nbe these: "I come, my lady, to acknowledge the receipt of the money\r\nsent to Ferrari\'s widow." Ah! you may well start, Mr. Troy! It almost\r\ntakes you off your guard, doesn\'t it? Make your mind easy, sir; I\r\nshall find the proof that everybody asks me for in her guilty face.\r\nLet her only change colour by the shadow of a shade--let her eyes only\r\ndrop for half an instant--I shall discover her! The one thing I want\r\nto know is, does the law permit it?\'\r\n\r\n\'The law permits it,\' Mr. Troy answered gravely; \'but whether her\r\nladyship will permit it, is quite another question. Have you really\r\ncourage enough, Mrs. Ferrari, to carry out this notable scheme of\r\nyours? You have been described to me, by Miss Lockwood, as rather a\r\nnervous, timid sort of person--and, if I may trust my own observation,\r\nI should say you justify the description.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you had lived in the country, sir, instead of living in London,\'\r\nMrs. Ferrari replied, \'you would sometimes have seen even a sheep turn\r\non a dog. I am far from saying that I am a bold woman--quite the\r\nreverse. But when I stand in that wretch\'s presence, and think of my\r\nmurdered husband, the one of us two who is likely to be frightened is\r\nnot me. I am going there now, sir. You shall hear how it ends. I\r\nwish you good-morning.\'\r\n\r\nWith those brave words the courier\'s wife gathered her mantle about\r\nher, and walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Troy smiled--not satirically, but compassionately. \'The little\r\nsimpleton!\' he thought to himself. \'If half of what they say of Lady\r\nMontbarry is true, Mrs. Ferrari and her trap have but a poor prospect\r\nbefore them. I wonder how it will end?\'\r\n\r\nAll Mr. Troy\'s experience failed to forewarn him of how it did end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Mrs. Ferrari held to her resolution. She went\r\nstraight from Mr. Troy\'s office to Newbury\'s Hotel.\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry was at home, and alone. But the authorities of the\r\nhotel hesitated to disturb her when they found that the visitor\r\ndeclined to mention her name. Her ladyship\'s new maid happened to\r\ncross the hall while the matter was still in debate. She was a\r\nFrenchwoman, and, on being appealed to, she settled the question in the\r\nswift, easy, rational French way. \'Madame\'s appearance was perfectly\r\nrespectable. Madame might have reasons for not mentioning her name\r\nwhich Miladi might approve. In any case, there being no orders\r\nforbidding the introduction of a strange lady, the matter clearly\r\nrested between Madame and Miladi. Would Madame, therefore, be good\r\nenough to follow Miladi\'s maid up the stairs?\'\r\n\r\nIn spite of her resolution, Mrs. Ferrari\'s heart beat as if it would\r\nburst out of her bosom, when her conductress led her into an ante-room,\r\nand knocked at a door opening into a room beyond. But it is remarkable\r\nthat persons of sensitively-nervous organisation are the very persons\r\nwho are capable of forcing themselves (apparently by the exercise of a\r\nspasmodic effort of will) into the performance of acts of the most\r\naudacious courage. A low, grave voice from the inner room said, \'Come\r\nin.\' The maid, opening the door, announced, \'A person to see you,\r\nMiladi, on business,\' and immediately retired. In the one instant\r\nwhile these events passed, timid little Mrs. Ferrari mastered her own\r\nthrobbing heart; stepped over the threshold, conscious of her clammy\r\nhands, dry lips, and burning head; and stood in the presence of Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s widow, to all outward appearance as supremely\r\nself-possessed as her ladyship herself.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in the afternoon, but the light in the room was dim.\r\nThe blinds were drawn down. Lady Montbarry sat with her back to the\r\nwindows, as if even the subdued daylight were disagreeable to her. She\r\nhad altered sadly for the worse in her personal appearance, since the\r\nmemorable day when Doctor Wybrow had seen her in his consulting-room.\r\nHer beauty was gone--her face had fallen away to mere skin and bone;\r\nthe contrast between her ghastly complexion and her steely glittering\r\nblack eyes was more startling than ever. Robed in dismal black,\r\nrelieved only by the brilliant whiteness of her widow\'s cap--reclining\r\nin a panther-like suppleness of attitude on a little green sofa--she\r\nlooked at the stranger who had intruded on her, with a moment\'s languid\r\ncuriosity, then dropped her eyes again to the hand-screen which she\r\nheld between her face and the fire. \'I don\'t know you,\' she said.\r\n\'What do you want with me?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari tried to answer. Her first burst of courage had already\r\nworn itself out. The bold words that she had determined to speak were\r\nliving words still in her mind, but they died on her lips.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Lady Montbarry looked round again at\r\nthe speechless stranger. \'Are you deaf?\' she asked. There was another\r\npause. Lady Montbarry quietly looked back again at the screen, and put\r\nanother question. \'Do you want money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Money!\' That one word roused the sinking spirit of the courier\'s\r\nwife. She recovered her courage; she found her voice. \'Look at me, my\r\nlady, if you please,\' she said, with a sudden outbreak of audacity.\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry looked round for the third time. The fatal words passed\r\nMrs. Ferrari\'s lips.\r\n\r\n\'I come, my lady, to acknowledge the receipt of the money sent to\r\nFerrari\'s widow.\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry\'s glittering black eyes rested with steady attention on\r\nthe woman who had addressed her in those terms. Not the faintest\r\nexpression of confusion or alarm, not even a momentary flutter of\r\ninterest stirred the deadly stillness of her face. She reposed as\r\nquietly, she held the screen as composedly, as ever. The test had been\r\ntried, and had utterly failed.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. Lady Montbarry considered with herself.\r\nThe smile that came slowly and went away suddenly--the smile at once so\r\nsad and so cruel--showed itself on her thin lips. She lifted her\r\nscreen, and pointed with it to a seat at the farther end of the room.\r\n\'Be so good as to take that chair,\' she said.\r\n\r\nHelpless under her first bewildering sense of failure--not knowing what\r\nto say or what to do next--Mrs. Ferrari mechanically obeyed. Lady\r\nMontbarry, rising on the sofa for the first time, watched her with\r\nundisguised scrutiny as she crossed the room--then sank back into a\r\nreclining position once more. \'No,\' she said to herself, \'the woman\r\nwalks steadily; she is not intoxicated--the only other possibility is\r\nthat she may be mad.\'\r\n\r\nShe had spoken loud enough to be heard. Stung by the insult, Mrs.\r\nFerrari instantly answered her: \'I am no more drunk or mad than you\r\nare!\'\r\n\r\n\'No?\' said Lady Montbarry. \'Then you are only insolent? The ignorant\r\nEnglish mind (I have observed) is apt to be insolent in the exercise of\r\nunrestrained English liberty. This is very noticeable to us foreigners\r\namong you people in the streets. Of course I can\'t be insolent to you,\r\nin return. I hardly know what to say to you. My maid was imprudent in\r\nadmitting you so easily to my room. I suppose your respectable\r\nappearance misled her. I wonder who you are? You mentioned the name\r\nof a courier who left us very strangely. Was he married by any chance?\r\nAre you his wife? And do you know where he is?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari\'s indignation burst its way through all restraints. She\r\nadvanced to the sofa; she feared nothing, in the fervour and rage of\r\nher reply.\r\n\r\n\'I am his widow--and you know it, you wicked woman! Ah! it was an evil\r\nhour when Miss Lockwood recommended my husband to be his lordship\'s\r\ncourier--!\'\r\n\r\nBefore she could add another word, Lady Montbarry sprang from the sofa\r\nwith the stealthy suddenness of a cat--seized her by both\r\nshoulders--and shook her with the strength and frenzy of a madwoman.\r\n\'You lie! you lie! you lie!\' She dropped her hold at the third\r\nrepetition of the accusation, and threw up her hands wildly with a\r\ngesture of despair. \'Oh, Jesu Maria! is it possible?\' she cried. \'Can\r\nthe courier have come to me through that woman?\' She turned like\r\nlightning on Mrs. Ferrari, and stopped her as she was escaping from the\r\nroom. \'Stay here, you fool--stay here, and answer me! If you cry out,\r\nas sure as the heavens are above you, I\'ll strangle you with my own\r\nhands. Sit down again--and fear nothing. Wretch! It is I who am\r\nfrightened--frightened out of my senses. Confess that you lied, when\r\nyou used Miss Lockwood\'s name just now! No! I don\'t believe you on\r\nyour oath; I will believe nobody but Miss Lockwood herself. Where does\r\nshe live? Tell me that, you noxious stinging little insect--and you\r\nmay go.\' Terrified as she was, Mrs. Ferrari hesitated. Lady Montbarry\r\nlifted her hands threateningly, with the long, lean, yellow-white\r\nfingers outspread and crooked at the tips. Mrs. Ferrari shrank at the\r\nsight of them, and gave the address. Lady Montbarry pointed\r\ncontemptuously to the door--then changed her mind. \'No! not yet! you\r\nwill tell Miss Lockwood what has happened, and she may refuse to see\r\nme. I will go there at once, and you shall go with me. As far as the\r\nhouse--not inside of it. Sit down again. I am going to ring for my\r\nmaid. Turn your back to the door--your cowardly face is not fit to be\r\nseen!\'\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell. The maid appeared.\r\n\r\n\'My cloak and bonnet--instantly!\'\r\n\r\nThe maid produced the cloak and bonnet from the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\'A cab at the door--before I can count ten!\'\r\n\r\nThe maid vanished. Lady Montbarry surveyed herself in the glass, and\r\nwheeled round again, with her cat-like suddenness, to Mrs. Ferrari.\r\n\r\n\'I look more than half dead already, don\'t I?\' she said with a grim\r\noutburst of irony. \'Give me your arm.\'\r\n\r\nShe took Mrs. Ferrari\'s arm, and left the room. \'You have nothing to\r\nfear, so long as you obey,\' she whispered, on the way downstairs. \'You\r\nleave me at Miss Lockwood\'s door, and never see me again.\'\r\n\r\nIn the hall they were met by the landlady of the hotel. Lady Montbarry\r\ngraciously presented her companion. \'My good friend Mrs. Ferrari; I am\r\nso glad to have seen her.\' The landlady accompanied them to the door.\r\nThe cab was waiting. \'Get in first, good Mrs. Ferrari,\' said her\r\nladyship; \'and tell the man where to go.\'\r\n\r\nThey were driven away. Lady Montbarry\'s variable humour changed again.\r\nWith a low groan of misery, she threw herself back in the cab. Lost in\r\nher own dark thoughts, as careless of the woman whom she had bent to\r\nher iron will as if no such person sat by her side, she preserved a\r\nsinister silence, until they reached the house where Miss Lockwood\r\nlodged. In an instant, she roused herself to action. She opened the\r\ndoor of the cab, and closed it again on Mrs. Ferrari, before the driver\r\ncould get off his box.\r\n\r\n\'Take that lady a mile farther on her way home!\' she said, as she paid\r\nthe man his fare. The next moment she had knocked at the house-door.\r\n\'Is Miss Lockwood at home?\' \'Yes, ma\'am.\' She stepped over the\r\nthreshold--the door closed on her.\r\n\r\n\'Which way, ma\'am?\' asked the driver of the cab.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari put her hand to her head, and tried to collect her\r\nthoughts. Could she leave her friend and benefactress helpless at Lady\r\nMontbarry\'s mercy? She was still vainly endeavouring to decide on the\r\ncourse that she ought to follow--when a gentleman, stopping at Miss\r\nLockwood\'s door, happened to look towards the cab-window, and saw her.\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to call on Miss Agnes too?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was Henry Westwick. Mrs. Ferrari clasped her hands in gratitude as\r\nshe recognised him.\r\n\r\n\'Go in, sir!\' she cried. \'Go in, directly. That dreadful woman is\r\nwith Miss Agnes. Go and protect her!\'\r\n\r\n\'What woman?\' Henry asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer literally struck him speechless. With amazement and\r\nindignation in his face, he looked at Mrs. Ferrari as she pronounced\r\nthe hated name of \'Lady Montbarry.\' \'I\'ll see to it,\' was all he said.\r\nHe knocked at the house-door; and he too, in his turn, was let in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Lady Montbarry, Miss.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes was writing a letter, when the servant astonished her by\r\nannouncing the visitor\'s name. Her first impulse was to refuse to see\r\nthe woman who had intruded on her. But Lady Montbarry had taken care\r\nto follow close on the servant\'s heels. Before Agnes could speak, she\r\nhad entered the room.\r\n\r\n\'I beg to apologise for my intrusion, Miss Lockwood. I have a question\r\nto ask you, in which I am very much interested. No one can answer me\r\nbut yourself.\' In low hesitating tones, with her glittering black eyes\r\nbent modestly on the ground, Lady Montbarry opened the interview in\r\nthose words.\r\n\r\nWithout answering, Agnes pointed to a chair. She could do this, and,\r\nfor the time, she could do no more. All that she had read of the\r\nhidden and sinister life in the palace at Venice; all that she had\r\nheard of Montbarry\'s melancholy death and burial in a foreign land; all\r\nthat she knew of the mystery of Ferrari\'s disappearance, rushed into\r\nher mind, when the black-robed figure confronted her, standing just\r\ninside the door. The strange conduct of Lady Montbarry added a new\r\nperplexity to the doubts and misgivings that troubled her. There stood\r\nthe adventuress whose character had left its mark on society all over\r\nEurope--the Fury who had terrified Mrs. Ferrari at the\r\nhotel--inconceivably transformed into a timid, shrinking woman! Lady\r\nMontbarry had not once ventured to look at Agnes, since she had made\r\nher way into the room. Advancing to take the chair that had been\r\npointed out to her, she hesitated, put her hand on the rail to support\r\nherself, and still remained standing. \'Please give me a moment to\r\ncompose myself,\' she said faintly. Her head sank on her bosom: she\r\nstood before Agnes like a conscious culprit before a merciless judge.\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed was, literally, the silence of fear on both\r\nsides. In the midst of it, the door was opened once more--and Henry\r\nWestwick appeared.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Lady Montbarry with a moment\'s steady attention--bowed to\r\nher with formal politeness--and passed on in silence. At the sight of\r\nher husband\'s brother, the sinking spirit of the woman sprang to life\r\nagain. Her drooping figure became erect. Her eyes met Westwick\'s\r\nlook, brightly defiant. She returned his bow with an icy smile of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nHenry crossed the room to Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'Is Lady Montbarry here by your invitation?\' he asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you wish to see her?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very painful to me to see her.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at his sister-in-law. \'Do you hear that?\' he asked\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\'I hear it,\' she answered, more coldly still.\r\n\r\n\'Your visit is, to say the least of it, ill-timed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your interference is, to say the least of it, out of place.\'\r\n\r\nWith that retort, Lady Montbarry approached Agnes. The presence of\r\nHenry Westwick seemed at once to relieve and embolden her. \'Permit me\r\nto ask my question, Miss Lockwood,\' she said, with graceful courtesy.\r\n\'It is nothing to embarrass you. When the courier Ferrari applied to\r\nmy late husband for employment, did you--\' Her resolution failed her,\r\nbefore she could say more. She sank trembling into the nearest chair,\r\nand, after a moment\'s struggle, composed herself again. \'Did you\r\npermit Ferrari,\' she resumed, \'to make sure of being chosen for our\r\ncourier by using your name?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes did not reply with her customary directness. Trifling as it was,\r\nthe reference to Montbarry, proceeding from that woman of all others,\r\nconfused and agitated her.\r\n\r\n\'I have known Ferrari\'s wife for many years,\' she began. \'And I take\r\nan interest--\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry abruptly lifted her hands with a gesture of entreaty.\r\n\'Ah, Miss Lockwood, don\'t waste time by talking of his wife! Answer my\r\nplain question, plainly!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me answer her,\' Henry whispered. \'I will undertake to speak\r\nplainly enough.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes refused by a gesture. Lady Montbarry\'s interruption had roused\r\nher sense of what was due to herself. She resumed her reply in plainer\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\'When Ferrari wrote to the late Lord Montbarry,\' she said, \'he did\r\ncertainly mention my name.\'\r\n\r\nEven now, she had innocently failed to see the object which her visitor\r\nhad in view. Lady Montbarry\'s impatience became ungovernable. She\r\nstarted to her feet, and advanced to Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'Was it with your knowledge and permission that Ferrari used your\r\nname?\' she asked. \'The whole soul of my question is in that. For\r\nGod\'s sake answer me--Yes, or No!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\nThat one word struck Lady Montbarry as a blow might have struck her.\r\nThe fierce life that had animated her face the instant before, faded\r\nout of it suddenly, and left her like a woman turned to stone. She\r\nstood, mechanically confronting Agnes, with a stillness so wrapt and\r\nperfect that not even the breath she drew was perceptible to the two\r\npersons who were looking at her.\r\n\r\nHenry spoke to her roughly. \'Rouse yourself,\' he said. \'You have\r\nreceived your answer.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked round at him. \'I have received my Sentence,\' she\r\nrejoined--and turned slowly to leave the room.\r\n\r\nTo Henry\'s astonishment, Agnes stopped her. \'Wait a moment, Lady\r\nMontbarry. I have something to ask on my side. You have spoken of\r\nFerrari. I wish to speak of him too.\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry bent her head in silence. Her hand trembled as she took\r\nout her handkerchief, and passed it over her forehead. Agnes detected\r\nthe trembling, and shrank back a step. \'Is the subject painful to\r\nyou?\' she asked timidly.\r\n\r\nStill silent, Lady Montbarry invited her by a wave of the hand to go\r\non. Henry approached, attentively watching his sister-in-law. Agnes\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\'No trace of Ferrari has been discovered in England,\' she said. \'Have\r\nyou any news of him? And will you tell me (if you have heard\r\nanything), in mercy to his wife?\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry\'s thin lips suddenly relaxed into their sad and cruel\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you ask me about the lost courier?\' she said. \'You will know\r\nwhat has become of him, Miss Lockwood, when the time is ripe for it.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes started. \'I don\'t understand you,\' she said. \'How shall I know?\r\nWill some one tell me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Some one will tell you.\'\r\n\r\nHenry could keep silence no longer. \'Perhaps, your ladyship may be the\r\nperson?\' he interrupted with ironical politeness.\r\n\r\nShe answered him with contemptuous ease. \'You may be right, Mr.\r\nWestwick. One day or another, I may be the person who tells Miss\r\nLockwood what has become of Ferrari, if--\' She stopped; with her eyes\r\nfixed on Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'If what?\' Henry asked.\r\n\r\n\'If Miss Lockwood forces me to it.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes listened in astonishment. \'Force you to it?\' she repeated. \'How\r\ncan I do that? Do you mean to say my will is stronger than yours?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean to say that the candle doesn\'t burn the moth, when the\r\nmoth flies into it?\' Lady Montbarry rejoined. \'Have you ever heard of\r\nsuch a thing as the fascination of terror? I am drawn to you by a\r\nfascination of terror. I have no right to visit you, I have no wish to\r\nvisit you: you are my enemy. For the first time in my life, against\r\nmy own will, I submit to my enemy. See! I am waiting because you told\r\nme to wait--and the fear of you (I swear it!) creeps through me while I\r\nstand here. Oh, don\'t let me excite your curiosity or your pity!\r\nFollow the example of Mr. Westwick. Be hard and brutal and\r\nunforgiving, like him. Grant me my release. Tell me to go.\'\r\n\r\nThe frank and simple nature of Agnes could discover but one\r\nintelligible meaning in this strange outbreak.\r\n\r\n\'You are mistaken in thinking me your enemy,\' she said. \'The wrong you\r\ndid me when you gave your hand to Lord Montbarry was not intentionally\r\ndone. I forgave you my sufferings in his lifetime. I forgive you even\r\nmore freely now that he has gone.\'\r\n\r\nHenry heard her with mingled emotions of admiration and distress. \'Say\r\nno more!\' he exclaimed. \'You are too good to her; she is not worthy of\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\nThe interruption passed unheeded by Lady Montbarry. The simple words\r\nin which Agnes had replied seemed to have absorbed the whole attention\r\nof this strangely-changeable woman. As she listened, her face settled\r\nslowly into an expression of hard and tearless sorrow. There was a\r\nmarked change in her voice when she spoke next. It expressed that last\r\nworst resignation which has done with hope.\r\n\r\n\'You good innocent creature,\' she said, \'what does your amiable\r\nforgiveness matter? What are your poor little wrongs, in the reckoning\r\nfor greater wrongs which is demanded of me? I am not trying to\r\nfrighten you, I am only miserable about myself. Do you know what it is\r\nto have a firm presentiment of calamity that is coming to you--and yet\r\nto hope that your own positive conviction will not prove true? When I\r\nfirst met you, before my marriage, and first felt your influence over\r\nme, I had that hope. It was a starveling sort of hope that lived a\r\nlingering life in me until to-day. You struck it dead, when you\r\nanswered my question about Ferrari.\'\r\n\r\n\'How have I destroyed your hopes?\' Agnes asked. \'What connection is\r\nthere between my permitting Ferrari to use my name to Lord Montbarry,\r\nand the strange and dreadful things you are saying to me now?\'\r\n\r\n\'The time is near, Miss Lockwood, when you will discover that for\r\nyourself. In the mean while, you shall know what my fear of you is, in\r\nthe plainest words I can find. On the day when I took your hero from\r\nyou and blighted your life--I am firmly persuaded of it!--you were made\r\nthe instrument of the retribution that my sins of many years had\r\ndeserved. Oh, such things have happened before to-day! One person has,\r\nbefore now, been the means of innocently ripening the growth of evil in\r\nanother. You have done that already--and you have more to do yet. You\r\nhave still to bring me to the day of discovery, and to the punishment\r\nthat is my doom. We shall meet again--here in England, or there in\r\nVenice where my husband died--and meet for the last time.\'\r\n\r\nIn spite of her better sense, in spite of her natural superiority to\r\nsuperstitions of all kinds, Agnes was impressed by the terrible\r\nearnestness with which those words were spoken. She turned pale as she\r\nlooked at Henry. \'Do you understand her?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing is easier than to understand her,\' he replied contemptuously.\r\n\'She knows what has become of Ferrari; and she is confusing you in a\r\ncloud of nonsense, because she daren\'t own the truth. Let her go!\'\r\n\r\nIf a dog had been under one of the chairs, and had barked, Lady\r\nMontbarry could not have proceeded more impenetrably with the last\r\nwords she had to say to Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'Advise your interesting Mrs. Ferrari to wait a little longer,\' she\r\nsaid. \'You will know what has become of her husband, and you will tell\r\nher. There will be nothing to alarm you. Some trifling event will\r\nbring us together the next time--as trifling, I dare say, as the\r\nengagement of Ferrari. Sad nonsense, Mr. Westwick, is it not? But you\r\nmake allowances for women; we all talk nonsense. Good morning, Miss\r\nLockwood.\'\r\n\r\nShe opened the door--suddenly, as if she was afraid of being called\r\nback for the second time--and left them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Do you think she is mad?\' Agnes asked.\r\n\r\n\'I think she is simply wicked. False, superstitious, inveterately\r\ncruel--but not mad. I believe her main motive in coming here was to\r\nenjoy the luxury of frightening you.\'\r\n\r\n\'She has frightened me. I am ashamed to own it--but so it is.\'\r\n\r\nHenry looked at her, hesitated for a moment, and seated himself on the\r\nsofa by her side.\r\n\r\n\'I am very anxious about you, Agnes,\' he said. \'But for the fortunate\r\nchance which led me to call here to-day--who knows what that vile woman\r\nmight not have said or done, if she had found you alone? My dear, you\r\nare leading a sadly unprotected solitary life. I don\'t like to think\r\nof it; I want to see it changed--especially after what has happened\r\nto-day. No! no! it is useless to tell me that you have your old nurse.\r\nShe is too old; she is not in your rank of life--there is no sufficient\r\nprotection in the companionship of such a person for a lady in your\r\nposition. Don\'t mistake me, Agnes! what I say, I say in the sincerity\r\nof my devotion to you.\' He paused, and took her hand. She made a\r\nfeeble effort to withdraw it--and yielded. \'Will the day never come,\'\r\nhe pleaded, \'when the privilege of protecting you may be mine? when you\r\nwill be the pride and joy of my life, as long as my life lasts?\' He\r\npressed her hand gently. She made no reply. The colour came and went\r\non her face; her eyes were turned away from him. \'Have I been so\r\nunhappy as to offend you?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nShe answered that--she said, almost in a whisper, \'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have I distressed you?\'\r\n\r\n\'You have made me think of the sad days that are gone.\' She said no\r\nmore; she only tried to withdraw her hand from his for the second time.\r\nHe still held it; he lifted it to his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Can I never make you think of other days than those--of the happier\r\ndays to come? Or, if you must think of the time that is passed, can\r\nyou not look back to the time when I first loved you?\'\r\n\r\nShe sighed as he put the question. \'Spare me, Henry,\' she answered\r\nsadly. \'Say no more!\'\r\n\r\nThe colour again rose in her cheeks; her hand trembled in his. She\r\nlooked lovely, with her eyes cast down and her bosom heaving gently.\r\nAt that moment he would have given everything he had in the world to\r\ntake her in his arms and kiss her. Some mysterious sympathy, passing\r\nfrom his hand to hers, seemed to tell her what was in his mind. She\r\nsnatched her hand away, and suddenly looked up at him. The tears were\r\nin her eyes. She said nothing; she let her eyes speak for her. They\r\nwarned him--without anger, without unkindness--but still they warned\r\nhim to press her no further that day.\r\n\r\n\'Only tell me that I am forgiven,\' he said, as he rose from the sofa.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she answered quietly, \'you are forgiven.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not lowered myself in your estimation, Agnes?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you wish me to leave you?\'\r\n\r\nShe rose, in her turn, from the sofa, and walked to her writing-table\r\nbefore she replied. The unfinished letter which she had been writing\r\nwhen Lady Montbarry interrupted her, lay open on the blotting-book. As\r\nshe looked at the letter, and then looked at Henry, the smile that\r\ncharmed everybody showed itself in her face.\r\n\r\n\'You must not go just yet,\' she said: \'I have something to tell you.\r\nI hardly know how to express it. The shortest way perhaps will be to\r\nlet you find it out for yourself. You have been speaking of my lonely\r\nunprotected life here. It is not a very happy life, Henry--I own\r\nthat.\' She paused, observing the growing anxiety of his expression as\r\nhe looked at her, with a shy satisfaction that perplexed him. \'Do you\r\nknow that I have anticipated your idea?\' she went on. \'I am going to\r\nmake a great change in my life--if your brother Stephen and his wife\r\nwill only consent to it.\' She opened the desk of the writing-table\r\nwhile she spoke, took a letter out, and handed it to Henry.\r\n\r\nHe received it from her mechanically. Vague doubts, which he hardly\r\nunderstood himself, kept him silent. It was impossible that the\r\n\'change in her life\' of which she had spoken could mean that she was\r\nabout to be married--and yet he was conscious of a perfectly\r\nunreasonable reluctance to open the letter. Their eyes met; she smiled\r\nagain. \'Look at the address,\' she said. \'You ought to know the\r\nhandwriting--but I dare say you don\'t.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at the address. It was in the large, irregular, uncertain\r\nwriting of a child. He opened the letter instantly.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Aunt Agnes,--Our governess is going away. She has had money left\r\nto her, and a house of her own. We have had cake and wine to drink her\r\nhealth. You promised to be our governess if we wanted another. We\r\nwant you. Mamma knows nothing about this. Please come before Mamma\r\ncan get another governess. Your loving Lucy, who writes this. Clara\r\nand Blanche have tried to write too. But they are too young to do it.\r\nThey blot the paper.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your eldest niece,\' Agnes explained, as Henry looked at her in\r\namazement. \'The children used to call me aunt when I was staying with\r\ntheir mother in Ireland, in the autumn. The three girls were my\r\ninseparable companions--they are the most charming children I know. It\r\nis quite true that I offered to be their governess, if they ever wanted\r\none, on the day when I left them to return to London. I was writing to\r\npropose it to their mother, just before you came.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not seriously!\' Henry exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAgnes placed her unfinished letter in his hand. Enough of it had been\r\nwritten to show that she did seriously propose to enter the household\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Westwick as governess to their children!\r\nHenry\'s bewilderment was not to be expressed in words.\r\n\r\n\'They won\'t believe you are in earnest,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' Agnes asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\'You are my brother Stephen\'s cousin; you are his wife\'s old friend.\'\r\n\r\n\'All the more reason, Henry, for trusting me with the charge of their\r\nchildren.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you are their equal; you are not obliged to get your living by\r\nteaching. There is something absurd in your entering their service as\r\na governess!\'\r\n\r\n\'What is there absurd in it? The children love me; the mother loves\r\nme; the father has shown me innumerable instances of his true\r\nfriendship and regard. I am the very woman for the place--and, as to\r\nmy education, I must have completely forgotten it indeed, if I am not\r\nfit to teach three children the eldest of whom is only eleven years\r\nold. You say I am their equal. Are there no other women who serve as\r\ngovernesses, and who are the equals of the persons whom they serve?\r\nBesides, I don\'t know that I am their equal. Have I not heard that\r\nyour brother Stephen was the next heir to the title? Will he not be\r\nthe new lord? Never mind answering me! We won\'t dispute whether I am\r\nright or wrong in turning governess--we will wait the event. I am\r\nweary of my lonely useless existence here, and eager to make my life\r\nmore happy and more useful, in the household of all others in which I\r\nshould like most to have a place. If you will look again, you will see\r\nthat I have these personal considerations still to urge before I finish\r\nmy letter. You don\'t know your brother and his wife as well as I do,\r\nif you doubt their answer. I believe they have courage enough and\r\nheart enough to say Yes.\'\r\n\r\nHenry submitted without being convinced.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who disliked all eccentric departures from custom and\r\nroutine; and he felt especially suspicious of the change proposed in\r\nthe life of Agnes. With new interests to occupy her mind, she might be\r\nless favourably disposed to listen to him, on the next occasion when he\r\nurged his suit. The influence of the \'lonely useless existence\' of\r\nwhich she complained, was distinctly an influence in his favour. While\r\nher heart was empty, her heart was accessible. But with his nieces in\r\nfull possession of it, the clouds of doubt overshadowed his prospects.\r\nHe knew the sex well enough to keep these purely selfish perplexities\r\nto himself. The waiting policy was especially the policy to pursue\r\nwith a woman as sensitive as Agnes. If he once offended her delicacy\r\nhe was lost. For the moment he wisely controlled himself and changed\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\'My little niece\'s letter has had an effect,\' he said, \'which the child\r\nnever contemplated in writing it. She has just reminded me of one of\r\nthe objects that I had in calling on you to-day.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes looked at the child\'s letter. \'How does Lucy do that?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Lucy\'s governess is not the only lucky person who has had money left\r\nher,\' Henry answered. \'Is your old nurse in the house?\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean to say that nurse has got a legacy?\'\r\n\r\n\'She has got a hundred pounds. Send for her, Agnes, while I show you\r\nthe letter.\'\r\n\r\nHe took a handful of letters from his pocket, and looked through them,\r\nwhile Agnes rang the bell. Returning to him, she noticed a printed\r\nletter among the rest, which lay open on the table. It was a\r\n\'prospectus,\' and the title of it was \'Palace Hotel Company of Venice\r\n(Limited).\' The two words, \'Palace\' and \'Venice,\' instantly recalled\r\nher mind to the unwelcome visit of Lady Montbarry. \'What is that?\' she\r\nasked, pointing to the title.\r\n\r\nHenry suspended his search, and glanced at the prospectus. \'A really\r\npromising speculation,\' he said. \'Large hotels always pay well, if\r\nthey are well managed. I know the man who is appointed to be manager\r\nof this hotel when it is opened to the public; and I have such entire\r\nconfidence in him that I have become one of the shareholders of the\r\nCompany.\'\r\n\r\nThe reply did not appear to satisfy Agnes. \'Why is the hotel called\r\nthe "Palace Hotel"?\' she inquired.\r\n\r\nHenry looked at her, and at once penetrated her motive for asking the\r\nquestion. \'Yes,\' he said, \'it is the palace that Montbarry hired at\r\nVenice; and it has been purchased by the Company to be changed into an\r\nhotel.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes turned away in silence, and took a chair at the farther end of\r\nthe room. Henry had disappointed her. His income as a younger son\r\nstood in need, as she well knew, of all the additions that he could\r\nmake to it by successful speculation. But she was unreasonable enough,\r\nnevertheless, to disapprove of his attempting to make money already out\r\nof the house in which his brother had died. Incapable of understanding\r\nthis purely sentimental view of a plain matter of business, Henry\r\nreturned to his papers, in some perplexity at the sudden change in the\r\nmanner of Agnes towards him. Just as he found the letter of which he\r\nwas in search, the nurse made her appearance. He glanced at Agnes,\r\nexpecting that she would speak first. She never even looked up when\r\nthe nurse came in. It was left to Henry to tell the old woman why the\r\nbell had summoned her to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\'Well, nurse,\' he said, \'you have had a windfall of luck. You have had\r\na legacy left you of a hundred pounds.\'\r\n\r\nThe nurse showed no outward signs of exultation. She waited a little\r\nto get the announcement of the legacy well settled in her mind--and\r\nthen she said quietly, \'Master Henry, who gives me that money, if you\r\nplease?\'\r\n\r\n\'My late brother, Lord Montbarry, gives it to you.\' (Agnes instantly\r\nlooked up, interested in the matter for the first time. Henry went\r\non.) \'His will leaves legacies to the surviving old servants of the\r\nfamily. There is a letter from his lawyers, authorising you to apply\r\nto them for the money.\'\r\n\r\nIn every class of society, gratitude is the rarest of all human\r\nvirtues. In the nurse\'s class it is extremely rare. Her opinion of\r\nthe man who had deceived and deserted her mistress remained the same\r\nopinion still, perfectly undisturbed by the passing circumstance of the\r\nlegacy.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder who reminded my lord of the old servants?\' she said. \'He\r\nwould never have heart enough to remember them himself!\'\r\n\r\nAgnes suddenly interposed. Nature, always abhorring monotony,\r\ninstitutes reserves of temper as elements in the composition of the\r\ngentlest women living. Even Agnes could, on rare occasions, be angry.\r\nThe nurse\'s view of Montbarry\'s character seemed to have provoked her\r\nbeyond endurance.\r\n\r\n\'If you have any sense of shame in you,\' she broke out, \'you ought to\r\nbe ashamed of what you have just said! Your ingratitude disgusts me.\r\nI leave you to speak with her, Henry--you won\'t mind it!\' With this\r\nsignificant intimation that he too had dropped out of his customary\r\nplace in her good opinion, she left the room.\r\n\r\nThe nurse received the smart reproof administered to her with every\r\nappearance of feeling rather amused by it than not. When the door had\r\nclosed, this female philosopher winked at Henry.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a power of obstinacy in young women,\' she remarked. \'Miss\r\nAgnes wouldn\'t give my lord up as a bad one, even when he jilted her.\r\nAnd now she\'s sweet on him after he\'s dead. Say a word against him,\r\nand she fires up as you see. All obstinacy! It will wear out with\r\ntime. Stick to her, Master Henry--stick to her!\'\r\n\r\n\'She doesn\'t seem to have offended you,\' said Henry.\r\n\r\n\'She?\' the nurse repeated in amazement--\'she offend me? I like her in\r\nher tantrums; it reminds me of her when she was a baby. Lord bless\r\nyou! when I go to bid her good-night, she\'ll give me a big kiss, poor\r\ndear--and say, Nurse, I didn\'t mean it! About this money, Master\r\nHenry? If I was younger I should spend it in dress and jewellery. But\r\nI\'m too old for that. What shall I do with my legacy when I have got\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\n\'Put it out at interest,\' Henry suggested. \'Get so much a year for it,\r\nyou know.\' \'How much shall I get?\' the nurse asked.\r\n\r\n\'If you put your hundred pounds into the Funds, you will get between\r\nthree and four pounds a year.\'\r\n\r\nThe nurse shook her head. \'Three or four pounds a year? That won\'t\r\ndo! I want more than that. Look here, Master Henry. I don\'t care\r\nabout this bit of money--I never did like the man who has left it to\r\nme, though he was your brother. If I lost it all to-morrow, I\r\nshouldn\'t break my heart; I\'m well enough off, as it is, for the rest\r\nof my days. They say you\'re a speculator. Put me in for a good thing,\r\nthere\'s a dear! Neck-or-nothing--and that for the Funds!\' She snapped\r\nher fingers to express her contempt for security of investment at three\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nHenry produced the prospectus of the Venetian Hotel Company. \'You\'re a\r\nfunny old woman,\' he said. \'There, you dashing speculator--there is\r\nneck-or-nothing for you! You must keep it a secret from Miss Agnes,\r\nmind. I\'m not at all sure that she would approve of my helping you to\r\nthis investment.\'\r\n\r\nThe nurse took out her spectacles. \'Six per cent., guaranteed,\' she\r\nread; \'and the Directors have every reason to believe that ten per\r\ncent., or more, will be ultimately realised to the shareholders by the\r\nhotel.\' \'Put me into that, Master Henry! And, wherever you go, for\r\nHeaven\'s sake recommend the hotel to your friends!\'\r\n\r\nSo the nurse, following Henry\'s mercenary example, had her pecuniary\r\ninterest, too, in the house in which Lord Montbarry had died.\r\n\r\nThree days passed before Henry was able to visit Agnes again. In that\r\ntime, the little cloud between them had entirely passed away. Agnes\r\nreceived him with even more than her customary kindness. She was in\r\nbetter spirits than usual. Her letter to Mrs. Stephen Westwick had\r\nbeen answered by return of post; and her proposal had been joyfully\r\naccepted, with one modification. She was to visit the Westwicks for a\r\nmonth--and, if she really liked teaching the children, she was then to\r\nbe governess, aunt, and cousin, all in one--and was only to go away in\r\nan event which her friends in Ireland persisted in contemplating, the\r\nevent of her marriage.\r\n\r\n\'You see I was right,\' she said to Henry.\r\n\r\nHe was still incredulous. \'Are you really going?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'I am going next week.\'\r\n\r\n\'When shall I see you again?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know you are always welcome at your brother\'s house. You can see\r\nme when you like.\' She held out her hand. \'Pardon me for leaving\r\nyou--I am beginning to pack up already.\'\r\n\r\nHenry tried to kiss her at parting. She drew back directly.\r\n\r\n\'Why not? I am your cousin,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like it,\' she answered.\r\n\r\nHenry looked at her, and submitted. Her refusal to grant him his\r\nprivilege as a cousin was a good sign--it was indirectly an act of\r\nencouragement to him in the character of her lover.\r\n\r\nOn the first day in the new week, Agnes left London on her way to\r\nIreland. As the event proved, this was not destined to be the end of\r\nher journey. The way to Ireland was only the first stage on a\r\nroundabout road--the road that led to the palace at Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1861, Agnes was established at the\r\ncountry-seat of her two friends--now promoted (on the death of the\r\nfirst lord, without offspring) to be the new Lord and Lady Montbarry.\r\nThe old nurse was not separated from her mistress. A place, suited to\r\nher time of life, had been found for her in the pleasant Irish\r\nhousehold. She was perfectly happy in her new sphere; and she spent\r\nher first half-year\'s dividend from the Venice Hotel Company, with\r\ncharacteristic prodigality, in presents for the children.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year, also, the Directors of the life insurance offices\r\nsubmitted to circumstances, and paid the ten thousand pounds.\r\nImmediately afterwards, the widow of the first Lord Montbarry\r\n(otherwise, the dowager Lady Montbarry) left England, with Baron Rivar,\r\nfor the United States. The Baron\'s object was announced, in the\r\nscientific columns of the newspapers, to be investigation into the\r\npresent state of experimental chemistry in the great American republic.\r\nHis sister informed inquiring friends that she accompanied him, in the\r\nhope of finding consolation in change of scene after the bereavement\r\nthat had fallen on her. Hearing this news from Henry Westwick (then\r\npaying a visit at his brother\'s house), Agnes was conscious of a\r\ncertain sense of relief. \'With the Atlantic between us,\' she said,\r\n\'surely I have done with that terrible woman now!\'\r\n\r\nBarely a week passed after those words had been spoken, before an event\r\nhappened which reminded Agnes of \'the terrible woman\' once more.\r\n\r\nOn that day, Henry\'s engagements had obliged him to return to London.\r\nHe had ventured, on the morning of his departure, to press his suit\r\nonce more on Agnes; and the children, as he had anticipated, proved to\r\nbe innocent obstacles in the way of his success. On the other hand, he\r\nhad privately secured a firm ally in his sister-in-law. \'Have a little\r\npatience,\' the new Lady Montbarry had said, \'and leave me to turn the\r\ninfluence of the children in the right direction. If they can persuade\r\nher to listen to you--they shall!\'\r\n\r\nThe two ladies had accompanied Henry, and some other guests who went\r\naway at the same time, to the railway station, and had just driven back\r\nto the house, when the servant announced that \'a person of the name of\r\nRolland was waiting to see her ladyship.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it a woman?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my lady.\'\r\n\r\nYoung Lady Montbarry turned to Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'This is the very person,\' she said, \'whom your lawyer thought likely\r\nto help him, when he was trying to trace the lost courier.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean the English maid who was with Lady Montbarry at Venice?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear! don\'t speak of Montbarry\'s horrid widow by the name which is\r\nmy name now. Stephen and I have arranged to call her by her foreign\r\ntitle, before she was married. I am "Lady Montbarry," and she is "the\r\nCountess." In that way there will be no confusion.--Yes, Mrs. Rolland\r\nwas in my service before she became the Countess\'s maid. She was a\r\nperfectly trustworthy person, with one defect that obliged me to send\r\nher away--a sullen temper which led to perpetual complaints of her in\r\nthe servants\' hall. Would you like to see her?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes accepted the proposal, in the faint hope of getting some\r\ninformation for the courier\'s wife. The complete defeat of every\r\nattempt to trace the lost man had been accepted as final by Mrs.\r\nFerrari. She had deliberately arrayed herself in widow\'s mourning; and\r\nwas earning her livelihood in an employment which the unwearied\r\nkindness of Agnes had procured for her in London. The last chance of\r\npenetrating the mystery of Ferrari\'s disappearance seemed to rest now\r\non what Ferrari\'s former fellow-servant might be able to tell. With\r\nhighly-wrought expectations, Agnes followed her friend into the room in\r\nwhich Mrs. Rolland was waiting.\r\n\r\nA tall bony woman, in the autumn of life, with sunken eyes and\r\niron-grey hair, rose stiffly from her chair, and saluted the ladies\r\nwith stern submission as they opened the door. A person of unblemished\r\ncharacter, evidently--but not without visible drawbacks. Big bushy\r\neyebrows, an awfully deep and solemn voice, a harsh unbending manner, a\r\ncomplete absence in her figure of the undulating lines characteristic\r\nof the sex, presented Virtue in this excellent person under its least\r\nalluring aspect. Strangers, on a first introduction to her, were\r\naccustomed to wonder why she was not a man.\r\n\r\n\'Are you pretty well, Mrs. Rolland?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am as well as I can expect to be, my lady, at my time of life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there anything I can do for you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your ladyship can do me a great favour, if you will please speak to my\r\ncharacter while I was in your service. I am offered a place, to wait\r\non an invalid lady who has lately come to live in this neighbourhood.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, yes--I have heard of her. A Mrs. Carbury, with a very pretty\r\nniece I am told. But, Mrs. Rolland, you left my service some time ago.\r\nMrs. Carbury will surely expect you to refer to the last mistress by\r\nwhom you were employed.\'\r\n\r\nA flash of virtuous indignation irradiated Mrs. Rolland\'s sunken eyes.\r\nShe coughed before she answered, as if her \'last mistress\' stuck in her\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\'I have explained to Mrs. Carbury, my lady, that the person I last\r\nserved--I really cannot give her her title in your ladyship\'s\r\npresence!--has left England for America. Mrs. Carbury knows that I\r\nquitted the person of my own free will, and knows why, and approves of\r\nmy conduct so far. A word from your ladyship will be amply sufficient\r\nto get me the situation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, Mrs. Rolland, I have no objection to be your reference,\r\nunder the circumstances. Mrs. Carbury will find me at home to-morrow\r\nuntil two o\'clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Carbury is not well enough to leave the house, my lady. Her\r\nniece, Miss Haldane, will call and make the inquiries, if your ladyship\r\nhas no objection.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not the least objection. The pretty niece carries her own\r\nwelcome with her. Wait a minute, Mrs. Rolland. This lady is Miss\r\nLockwood--my husband\'s cousin, and my friend. She is anxious to speak\r\nto you about the courier who was in the late Lord Montbarry\'s service\r\nat Venice.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland\'s bushy eyebrows frowned in stern disapproval of the new\r\ntopic of conversation. \'I regret to hear it, my lady,\' was all she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps you have not been informed of what happened after you left\r\nVenice?\' Agnes ventured to add. \'Ferrari left the palace secretly;\r\nand he has never been heard of since.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland mysteriously closed her eyes--as if to exclude some vision\r\nof the lost courier which was of a nature to disturb a respectable\r\nwoman. \'Nothing that Mr. Ferrari could do would surprise me,\' she\r\nreplied in her deepest bass tones.\r\n\r\n\'You speak rather harshly of him,\' said Agnes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland suddenly opened her eyes again. \'I speak harshly of\r\nnobody without reason,\' she said. \'Mr. Ferrari behaved to me, Miss\r\nLockwood, as no man living has ever behaved--before or since.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did he do?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland answered, with a stony stare of horror:-- \'He took\r\nliberties with me.\'\r\n\r\nYoung Lady Montbarry suddenly turned aside, and put her handkerchief\r\nover her mouth in convulsions of suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland went on, with a grim enjoyment of the bewilderment which\r\nher reply had produced in Agnes: \'And when I insisted on an apology,\r\nMiss, he had the audacity to say that the life at the palace was dull,\r\nand he didn\'t know how else to amuse himself!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid I have hardly made myself understood,\' said Agnes. \'I am\r\nnot speaking to you out of any interest in Ferrari. Are you aware that\r\nhe is married?\'\r\n\r\n\'I pity his wife,\' said Mrs. Rolland.\r\n\r\n\'She is naturally in great grief about him,\' Agnes proceeded.\r\n\r\n\'She ought to thank God she is rid of him,\' Mrs. Rolland interposed.\r\n\r\nAgnes still persisted. \'I have known Mrs. Ferrari from her childhood,\r\nand I am sincerely anxious to help her in this matter. Did you notice\r\nanything, while you were at Venice, that would account for her\r\nhusband\'s extraordinary disappearance? On what sort of terms, for\r\ninstance, did he live with his master and mistress?\'\r\n\r\n\'On terms of familiarity with his mistress,\' said Mrs. Rolland, \'which\r\nwere simply sickening to a respectable English servant. She used to\r\nencourage him to talk to her about all his affairs--how he got on with\r\nhis wife, and how pressed he was for money, and such like--just as if\r\nthey were equals. Contemptible--that\'s what I call it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And his master?\' Agnes continued. \'How did Ferrari get on with Lord\r\nMontbarry?\'\r\n\r\n\'My lord used to live shut up with his studies and his sorrows,\' Mrs.\r\nRolland answered, with a hard solemnity expressive of respect for his\r\nlordship\'s memory. \'Mr. Ferrari got his money when it was due; and he\r\ncared for nothing else. "If I could afford it, I would leave the place\r\ntoo; but I can\'t afford it." Those were the last words he said to me,\r\non the morning when I left the palace. I made no reply. After what\r\nhad happened (on that other occasion) I was naturally not on speaking\r\nterms with Mr. Ferrari.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can you really tell me nothing which will throw any light on this\r\nmatter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' said Mrs. Rolland, with an undisguised relish of the\r\ndisappointment that she was inflicting.\r\n\r\n\'There was another member of the family at Venice,\' Agnes resumed,\r\ndetermined to sift the question to the bottom while she had the chance.\r\n\'There was Baron Rivar.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Rolland lifted her large hands, covered with rusty black gloves,\r\nin mute protest against the introduction of Baron Rivar as a subject of\r\ninquiry. \'Are you aware, Miss,\' she began, \'that I left my place in\r\nconsequence of what I observed--?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes stopped her there. \'I only wanted to ask,\' she explained, \'if\r\nanything was said or done by Baron Rivar which might account for\r\nFerrari\'s strange conduct.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing that I know of,\' said Mrs. Rolland. \'The Baron and Mr.\r\nFerrari (if I may use such an expression) were "birds of a feather," so\r\nfar as I could see--I mean, one was as unprincipled as the other. I am\r\na just woman; and I will give you an example. Only the day before I\r\nleft, I heard the Baron say (through the open door of his room while I\r\nwas passing along the corridor), "Ferrari, I want a thousand pounds.\r\nWhat would you do for a thousand pounds?" And I heard Mr. Ferrari\r\nanswer, "Anything, sir, as long as I was not found out." And then they\r\nboth burst out laughing. I heard no more than that. Judge for\r\nyourself, Miss.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes reflected for a moment. A thousand pounds was the sum that had\r\nbeen sent to Mrs. Ferrari in the anonymous letter. Was that enclosure\r\nin any way connected, as a result, with the conversation between the\r\nBaron and Ferrari? It was useless to press any more inquiries on Mrs.\r\nRolland. She could give no further information which was of the\r\nslightest importance to the object in view. There was no alternative\r\nbut to grant her dismissal. One more effort had been made to find a\r\ntrace of the lost man, and once again the effort had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were a family party at the dinner-table that day. The only guest\r\nleft in the house was a nephew of the new Lord Montbarry--the eldest\r\nson of his sister, Lady Barville. Lady Montbarry could not resist\r\ntelling the story of the first (and last) attack made on the virtue of\r\nMrs. Rolland, with a comically-exact imitation of Mrs. Rolland\'s deep\r\nand dismal voice. Being asked by her husband what was the object which\r\nhad brought that formidable person to the house, she naturally\r\nmentioned the expected visit of Miss Haldane. Arthur Barville,\r\nunusually silent and pre-occupied so far, suddenly struck into the\r\nconversation with a burst of enthusiasm. \'Miss Haldane is the most\r\ncharming girl in all Ireland!\' he said. \'I caught sight of her\r\nyesterday, over the wall of her garden, as I was riding by. What time\r\nis she coming to-morrow? Before two? I\'ll look into the drawing-room\r\nby accident--I am dying to be introduced to her!\'\r\n\r\nAgnes was amused by his enthusiasm. \'Are you in love with Miss Haldane\r\nalready?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nArthur answered gravely, \'It\'s no joking matter. I have been all day\r\nat the garden wall, waiting to see her again! It depends on Miss\r\nHaldane to make me the happiest or the wretchedest man living.\'\r\n\r\n\'You foolish boy! How can you talk such nonsense?\'\r\n\r\nHe was talking nonsense undoubtedly. But, if Agnes had only known it,\r\nhe was doing something more than that. He was innocently leading her\r\nanother stage nearer on the way to Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the summer months advanced, the transformation of the Venetian\r\npalace into the modern hotel proceeded rapidly towards completion.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the building, with its fine Palladian front looking on\r\nthe canal, was wisely left unaltered. Inside, as a matter of\r\nnecessity, the rooms were almost rebuilt--so far at least as the size\r\nand the arrangement of them were concerned. The vast saloons were\r\npartitioned off into \'apartments\' containing three or four rooms each.\r\nThe broad corridors in the upper regions afforded spare space enough\r\nfor rows of little bedchambers, devoted to servants and to travellers\r\nwith limited means. Nothing was spared but the solid floors and the\r\nfinely-carved ceilings. These last, in excellent preservation as to\r\nworkmanship, merely required cleaning, and regilding here and there, to\r\nadd greatly to the beauty and importance of the best rooms in the\r\nhotel. The only exception to the complete re-organization of the\r\ninterior was at one extremity of the edifice, on the first and second\r\nfloors. Here there happened, in each case, to be rooms of such\r\ncomparatively moderate size, and so attractively decorated, that the\r\narchitect suggested leaving them as they were. It was afterwards\r\ndiscovered that these were no other than the apartments formerly\r\noccupied by Lord Montbarry (on the first floor), and by Baron Rivar (on\r\nthe second). The room in which Montbarry had died was still fitted up\r\nas a bedroom, and was now distinguished as Number Fourteen. The room\r\nabove it, in which the Baron had slept, took its place on the\r\nhotel-register as Number Thirty-Eight. With the ornaments on the walls\r\nand ceilings cleaned and brightened up, and with the heavy\r\nold-fashioned beds, chairs, and tables replaced by bright, pretty, and\r\nluxurious modern furniture, these two promised to be at once the most\r\nattractive and the most comfortable bedchambers in the hotel. As for\r\nthe once-desolate and disused ground floor of the building, it was now\r\ntransformed, by means of splendid dining-rooms, reception-rooms,\r\nbilliard-rooms, and smoking-rooms, into a palace by itself. Even the\r\ndungeon-like vaults beneath, now lighted and ventilated on the most\r\napproved modern plan, had been turned as if by magic into kitchens,\r\nservants\' offices, ice-rooms, and wine cellars, worthy of the splendour\r\nof the grandest hotel in Italy, in the now bygone period of seventeen\r\nyears since.\r\n\r\nPassing from the lapse of the summer months at Venice, to the lapse of\r\nthe summer months in Ireland, it is next to be recorded that Mrs.\r\nRolland obtained the situation of attendant on the invalid Mrs.\r\nCarbury; and that the fair Miss Haldane, like a female Caesar, came,\r\nsaw, and conquered, on her first day\'s visit to the new Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were as loud in her praises as Arthur Barville himself.\r\nLord Montbarry declared that she was the only perfectly pretty woman he\r\nhad ever seen, who was really unconscious of her own attractions. The\r\nold nurse said she looked as if she had just stepped out of a picture,\r\nand wanted nothing but a gilt frame round her to make her complete.\r\nMiss Haldane, on her side, returned from her first visit to the\r\nMontbarrys charmed with her new acquaintances. Later on the same day,\r\nArthur called with an offering of fruit and flowers for Mrs. Carbury,\r\nand with instructions to ask if she was well enough to receive Lord and\r\nLady Montbarry and Miss Lockwood on the morrow. In a week\'s time, the\r\ntwo households were on the friendliest terms. Mrs. Carbury, confined\r\nto the sofa by a spinal malady, had been hitherto dependent on her\r\nniece for one of the few pleasures she could enjoy, the pleasure of\r\nhaving the best new novels read to her as they came out. Discovering\r\nthis, Arthur volunteered to relieve Miss Haldane, at intervals, in the\r\noffice of reader. He was clever at mechanical contrivances of all\r\nsorts, and he introduced improvements in Mrs. Carbury\'s couch, and in\r\nthe means of conveying her from the bedchamber to the drawing-room,\r\nwhich alleviated the poor lady\'s sufferings and brightened her gloomy\r\nlife. With these claims on the gratitude of the aunt, aided by the\r\npersonal advantages which he unquestionably possessed, Arthur advanced\r\nrapidly in the favour of the charming niece. She was, it is needless\r\nto say, perfectly well aware that he was in love with her, while he was\r\nhimself modestly reticent on the subject--so far as words went. But\r\nshe was not equally quick in penetrating the nature of her own feelings\r\ntowards Arthur. Watching the two young people with keen powers of\r\nobservation, necessarily concentrated on them by the complete seclusion\r\nof her life, the invalid lady discovered signs of roused sensibility in\r\nMiss Haldane, when Arthur was present, which had never yet shown\r\nthemselves in her social relations with other admirers eager to pay\r\ntheir addresses to her. Having drawn her own conclusions in private,\r\nMrs. Carbury took the first favourable opportunity (in Arthur\'s\r\ninterests) of putting them to the test.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what I shall do,\' she said one day, \'when Arthur goes\r\naway.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Haldane looked up quickly from her work. \'Surely he is not going\r\nto leave us!\' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'My dear! he has already stayed at his uncle\'s house a month longer\r\nthan he intended. His father and mother naturally expect to see him at\r\nhome again.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Haldane met this difficulty with a suggestion, which could only\r\nhave proceeded from a judgment already disturbed by the ravages of the\r\ntender passion. \'Why can\'t his father and mother go and see him at\r\nLord Montbarry\'s?\' she asked. \'Sir Theodore\'s place is only thirty\r\nmiles away, and Lady Barville is Lord Montbarry\'s sister. They needn\'t\r\nstand on ceremony.\'\r\n\r\n\'They may have other engagements,\' Mrs. Carbury remarked.\r\n\r\n\'My dear aunt, we don\'t know that! Suppose you ask Arthur?\'\r\n\r\n\'Suppose you ask him?\'\r\n\r\nMiss Haldane bent her head again over her work. Suddenly as it was\r\ndone, her aunt had seen her face--and her face betrayed her.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur came the next day, Mrs. Carbury said a word to him in\r\nprivate, while her niece was in the garden. The last new novel lay\r\nneglected on the table. Arthur followed Miss Haldane into the garden.\r\nThe next day he wrote home, enclosing in his letter a photograph of\r\nMiss Haldane. Before the end of the week, Sir Theodore and Lady\r\nBarville arrived at Lord Montbarry\'s, and formed their own judgment of\r\nthe fidelity of the portrait. They had themselves married early in\r\nlife--and, strange to say, they did not object on principle to the\r\nearly marriages of other people. The question of age being thus\r\ndisposed of, the course of true love had no other obstacles to\r\nencounter. Miss Haldane was an only child, and was possessed of an\r\nample fortune. Arthur\'s career at the university had been creditable,\r\nbut certainly not brilliant enough to present his withdrawal in the\r\nlight of a disaster. As Sir Theodore\'s eldest son, his position was\r\nalready made for him. He was two-and-twenty years of age; and the\r\nyoung lady was eighteen. There was really no producible reason for\r\nkeeping the lovers waiting, and no excuse for deferring the wedding-day\r\nbeyond the first week in September. In the interval, while the bride\r\nand bridegroom would be necessarily absent on the inevitable tour\r\nabroad, a sister of Mrs. Carbury volunteered to stay with her during\r\nthe temporary separation from her niece. On the conclusion of the\r\nhoneymoon, the young couple were to return to Ireland, and were to\r\nestablish themselves in Mrs. Carbury\'s spacious and comfortable house.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were decided upon early in the month of August.\r\nAbout the same date, the last alterations in the old palace at Venice\r\nwere completed. The rooms were dried by steam; the cellars were\r\nstocked; the manager collected round him his army of skilled servants;\r\nand the new hotel was advertised all over Europe to open in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n         (MISS AGNES LOCKWOOD TO MRS. FERRARI)\r\n\r\n\'I promised to give you some account, dear Emily, of the marriage of\r\nMr. Arthur Barville and Miss Haldane. It took place ten days since.\r\nBut I have had so many things to look after in the absence of the\r\nmaster and mistress of this house, that I am only able to write to you\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\'The invitations to the wedding were limited to members of the families\r\non either side, in consideration of the ill health of Miss Haldane\'s\r\naunt. On the side of the Montbarry family, there were present, besides\r\nLord and Lady Montbarry, Sir Theodore and Lady Barville; Mrs. Norbury\r\n(whom you may remember as his lordship\'s second sister); and Mr.\r\nFrancis Westwick, and Mr. Henry Westwick. The three children and I\r\nattended the ceremony as bridesmaids. We were joined by two young\r\nladies, cousins of the bride and very agreeable girls. Our dresses\r\nwere white, trimmed with green in honour of Ireland; and we each had a\r\nhandsome gold bracelet given to us as a present from the bridegroom.\r\nIf you add to the persons whom I have already mentioned, the elder\r\nmembers of Mrs. Carbury\'s family, and the old servants in both\r\nhouses--privileged to drink the healths of the married pair at the\r\nlower end of the room--you will have the list of the company at the\r\nwedding-breakfast complete.\r\n\r\n\'The weather was perfect, and the ceremony (with music) was beautifully\r\nperformed. As for the bride, no words can describe how lovely she\r\nlooked, or how well she went through it all. We were very merry at the\r\nbreakfast, and the speeches went off on the whole quite well enough.\r\nThe last speech, before the party broke up, was made by Mr. Henry\r\nWestwick, and was the best of all. He offered a happy suggestion, at\r\nthe end, which has produced a very unexpected change in my life here.\r\n\r\n\'As well as I remember, he concluded in these words:--"On one point, we\r\nare all agreed--we are sorry that the parting hour is near, and we\r\nshould be glad to meet again. Why should we not meet again? This is\r\nthe autumn time of the year; we are most of us leaving home for the\r\nholidays. What do you say (if you have no engagements that will\r\nprevent it) to joining our young married friends before the close of\r\ntheir tour, and renewing the social success of this delightful\r\nbreakfast by another festival in honour of the honeymoon? The bride\r\nand bridegroom are going to Germany and the Tyrol, on their way to\r\nItaly. I propose that we allow them a month to themselves, and that we\r\narrange to meet them afterwards in the North of Italy--say at Venice."\r\n\r\n\'This proposal was received with great applause, which was changed into\r\nshouts of laughter by no less a person than my dear old nurse. The\r\nmoment Mr. Westwick pronounced the word "Venice," she started up among\r\nthe servants at the lower end of the room, and called out at the top of\r\nher voice, "Go to our hotel, ladies and gentlemen! We get six per\r\ncent. on our money already; and if you will only crowd the place and\r\ncall for the best of everything, it will be ten per cent. in our pockets\r\nin no time. Ask Master Henry!"\r\n\r\n\'Appealed to in this irresistible manner, Mr. Westwick had no choice\r\nbut to explain that he was concerned as a shareholder in a new Hotel\r\nCompany at Venice, and that he had invested a small sum of money for\r\nthe nurse (not very considerately, as I think) in the speculation.\r\nHearing this, the company, by way of humouring the joke, drank a new\r\ntoast:--Success to the nurse\'s hotel, and a speedy rise in the dividend!\r\n\r\n\'When the conversation returned in due time to the more serious\r\nquestion of the proposed meeting at Venice, difficulties began to\r\npresent themselves, caused of course by invitations for the autumn\r\nwhich many of the guests had already accepted. Only two members of\r\nMrs. Carbury\'s family were at liberty to keep the proposed appointment.\r\nOn our side we were more at leisure to do as we pleased. Mr. Henry\r\nWestwick decided to go to Venice in advance of the rest, to test the\r\naccommodation of the new hotel on the opening day. Mrs. Norbury and\r\nMr. Francis Westwick volunteered to follow him; and, after some\r\npersuasion, Lord and Lady Montbarry consented to a species of\r\ncompromise. His lordship could not conveniently spare time enough for\r\nthe journey to Venice, but he and Lady Montbarry arranged to accompany\r\nMrs. Norbury and Mr. Francis Westwick as far on their way to Italy as\r\nParis. Five days since, they took their departure to meet their\r\ntravelling companions in London; leaving me here in charge of the three\r\ndear children. They begged hard, of course, to be taken with papa and\r\nmamma. But it was thought better not to interrupt the progress of\r\ntheir education, and not to expose them (especially the two younger\r\ngirls) to the fatigues of travelling.\r\n\r\n\'I have had a charming letter from the bride, this morning, dated\r\nCologne. You cannot think how artlessly and prettily she assures me of\r\nher happiness. Some people, as they say in Ireland, are born to good\r\nluck--and I think Arthur Barville is one of them.\r\n\r\n\'When you next write, I hope to hear that you are in better health and\r\nspirits, and that you continue to like your employment. Believe me,\r\nsincerely your friend,--A. L.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes had just closed and directed her letter, when the eldest of her\r\nthree pupils entered the room with the startling announcement that Lord\r\nMontbarry\'s travelling-servant had arrived from Paris! Alarmed by the\r\nidea that some misfortune had happened, she ran out to meet the man in\r\nthe hall. Her face told him how seriously he had frightened her,\r\nbefore she could speak. \'There\'s nothing wrong, Miss,\' he hastened to\r\nsay. \'My lord and my lady are enjoying themselves at Paris. They only\r\nwant you and the young ladies to be with them.\' Saying these amazing\r\nwords, he handed to Agnes a letter from Lady Montbarry.\r\n\r\n\'Dearest Agnes,\' (she read), \'I am so charmed with the delightful\r\nchange in my life--it is six years, remember, since I last travelled on\r\nthe Continent--that I have exerted all my fascinations to persuade Lord\r\nMontbarry to go on to Venice. And, what is more to the purpose, I have\r\nactually succeeded! He has just gone to his room to write the\r\nnecessary letters of excuse in time for the post to England. May you\r\nhave as good a husband, my dear, when your time comes! In the mean\r\nwhile, the one thing wanting now to make my happiness complete, is to\r\nhave you and the darling children with us. Montbarry is just as\r\nmiserable without them as I am--though he doesn\'t confess it so freely.\r\nYou will have no difficulties to trouble you. Louis will deliver these\r\nhurried lines, and will take care of you on the journey to Paris. Kiss\r\nthe children for me a thousand times--and never mind their education\r\nfor the present! Pack up instantly, my dear, and I will be fonder of\r\nyou than ever. Your affectionate friend, Adela Montbarry.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes folded up the letter; and, feeling the need of composing herself,\r\ntook refuge for a few minutes in her own room.\r\n\r\nHer first natural sensations of surprise and excitement at the prospect\r\nof going to Venice were succeeded by impressions of a less agreeable\r\nkind. With the recovery of her customary composure came the unwelcome\r\nremembrance of the parting words spoken to her by Montbarry\'s\r\nwidow:--\'We shall meet again--here in England, or there in Venice where\r\nmy husband died--and meet for the last time.\'\r\n\r\nIt was an odd coincidence, to say the least of it, that the march of\r\nevents should be unexpectedly taking Agnes to Venice, after those words\r\nhad been spoken! Was the woman of the mysterious warnings and the wild\r\nblack eyes still thousands of miles away in America? Or was the march\r\nof events taking her unexpectedly, too, on the journey to Venice?\r\nAgnes started out of her chair, ashamed of even the momentary\r\nconcession to superstition which was implied by the mere presence of\r\nsuch questions as these in her mind.\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell, and sent for her little pupils, and announced their\r\napproaching departure to the household. The noisy delight of the\r\nchildren, the inspiriting effort of packing up in a hurry, roused all\r\nher energies. She dismissed her own absurd misgivings from\r\nconsideration, with the contempt that they deserved. She worked as\r\nonly women can work, when their hearts are in what they do. The\r\ntravellers reached Dublin that day, in time for the boat to England.\r\nTwo days later, they were with Lord and Lady Montbarry at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only the twentieth of September, when Agnes and the children\r\nreached Paris. Mrs. Norbury and her brother Francis had then already\r\nstarted on their journey to Italy--at least three weeks before the date\r\nat which the new hotel was to open for the reception of travellers.\r\n\r\nThe person answerable for this premature departure was Francis Westwick.\r\n\r\nLike his younger brother Henry, he had increased his pecuniary\r\nresources by his own enterprise and ingenuity; with this difference,\r\nthat his speculations were connected with the Arts. He had made money,\r\nin the first instance, by a weekly newspaper; and he had then invested\r\nhis profits in a London theatre. This latter enterprise, admirably\r\nconducted, had been rewarded by the public with steady and liberal\r\nencouragement. Pondering over a new form of theatrical attraction for\r\nthe coming winter season, Francis had determined to revive the languid\r\npublic taste for the ballet by means of an entertainment of his own\r\ninvention, combining dramatic interest with dancing. He was now,\r\naccordingly, in search of the best dancer (possessed of the\r\nindispensable personal attractions) who was to be found in the theatres\r\nof the Continent. Hearing from his foreign correspondents of two women\r\nwho had made successful first appearances, one at Milan and one at\r\nFlorence, he had arranged to visit those cities, and to judge of the\r\nmerits of the dancers for himself, before he joined the bride and\r\nbridegroom. His widowed sister, having friends at Florence whom she\r\nwas anxious to see, readily accompanied him. The Montbarrys remained\r\nat Paris, until it was time to present themselves at the family meeting\r\nin Venice. Henry found them still in the French capital, when he\r\narrived from London on his way to the opening of the new hotel.\r\n\r\nAgainst Lady Montbarry\'s advice, he took the opportunity of renewing\r\nhis addresses to Agnes. He could hardly have chosen a more\r\nunpropitious time for pleading his cause with her. The gaieties of\r\nParis (quite incomprehensibly to herself as well as to everyone about\r\nher) had a depressing effect on her spirits. She had no illness to\r\ncomplain of; she shared willingly in the ever-varying succession of\r\namusements offered to strangers by the ingenuity of the liveliest\r\npeople in the world--but nothing roused her: she remained persistently\r\ndull and weary through it all. In this frame of mind and body, she was\r\nin no humour to receive Henry\'s ill-timed addresses with favour, or\r\neven with patience: she plainly and positively refused to listen to\r\nhim. \'Why do you remind me of what I have suffered?\' she asked\r\npetulantly. \'Don\'t you see that it has left its mark on me for life?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I knew something of women by this time,\' Henry said,\r\nappealing privately to Lady Montbarry for consolation. \'But Agnes\r\ncompletely puzzles me. It is a year since Montbarry\'s death; and she\r\nremains as devoted to his memory as if he had died faithful to her--she\r\nstill feels the loss of him, as none of us feel it!\'\r\n\r\n\'She is the truest woman that ever breathed the breath of life,\' Lady\r\nMontbarry answered. \'Remember that, and you will understand her. Can\r\nsuch a woman as Agnes give her love or refuse it, according to\r\ncircumstances? Because the man was unworthy of her, was he less the\r\nman of her choice? The truest and best friend to him (little as he\r\ndeserved it) in his lifetime, she naturally remains the truest and best\r\nfriend to his memory now. If you really love her, wait; and trust to\r\nyour two best friends--to time and to me. There is my advice; let your\r\nown experience decide whether it is not the best advice that I can\r\noffer. Resume your journey to Venice to-morrow; and when you take\r\nleave of Agnes, speak to her as cordially as if nothing had happened.\'\r\n\r\nHenry wisely followed this advice. Thoroughly understanding him, Agnes\r\nmade the leave-taking friendly and pleasant on her side. When he\r\nstopped at the door for a last look at her, she hurriedly turned her\r\nhead so that her face was hidden from him. Was that a good sign? Lady\r\nMontbarry, accompanying Henry down the stairs, said, \'Yes, decidedly!\r\nWrite when you get to Venice. We shall wait here to receive letters\r\nfrom Arthur and his wife, and we shall time our departure for Italy\r\naccordingly.\'\r\n\r\nA week passed, and no letter came from Henry. Some days later, a\r\ntelegram was received from him. It was despatched from Milan, instead\r\nof from Venice; and it brought this strange message:--\'I have left the\r\nhotel. Will return on the arrival of Arthur and his wife. Address,\r\nmeanwhile, Albergo Reale, Milan.\'\r\n\r\nPreferring Venice before all other cities of Europe, and having\r\narranged to remain there until the family meeting took place, what\r\nunexpected event had led Henry to alter his plans? and why did he state\r\nthe bare fact, without adding a word of explanation? Let the narrative\r\nfollow him--and find the answer to those questions at Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palace Hotel, appealing for encouragement mainly to English and\r\nAmerican travellers, celebrated the opening of its doors, as a matter\r\nof course, by the giving of a grand banquet, and the delivery of a long\r\nsuccession of speeches.\r\n\r\nDelayed on his journey, Henry Westwick only reached Venice in time to\r\njoin the guests over their coffee and cigars. Observing the splendour\r\nof the reception rooms, and taking note especially of the artful\r\nmixture of comfort and luxury in the bedchambers, he began to share the\r\nold nurse\'s view of the future, and to contemplate seriously the coming\r\ndividend of ten per cent. The hotel was beginning well, at all events.\r\nSo much interest in the enterprise had been aroused, at home and\r\nabroad, by profuse advertising, that the whole accommodation of the\r\nbuilding had been secured by travellers of all nations for the opening\r\nnight. Henry only obtained one of the small rooms on the upper floor,\r\nby a lucky accident--the absence of the gentleman who had written to\r\nengage it. He was quite satisfied, and was on his way to bed, when\r\nanother accident altered his prospects for the night, and moved him\r\ninto another and a better room.\r\n\r\nAscending on his way to the higher regions as far as the first floor of\r\nthe hotel, Henry\'s attention was attracted by an angry voice\r\nprotesting, in a strong New England accent, against one of the greatest\r\nhardships that can be inflicted on a citizen of the United States--the\r\nhardship of sending him to bed without gas in his room.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are not only the most hospitable people to be found on\r\nthe face of the earth--they are (under certain conditions) the most\r\npatient and good-tempered people as well. But they are human; and the\r\nlimit of American endurance is found in the obsolete institution of a\r\nbedroom candle. The American traveller, in the present case, declined\r\nto believe that his bedroom was in a complete finished state without a\r\ngas-burner. The manager pointed to the fine antique decorations\r\n(renewed and regilt) on the walls and the ceiling, and explained that\r\nthe emanations of burning gas-light would certainly spoil them in the\r\ncourse of a few months. To this the traveller replied that it was\r\npossible, but that he did not understand decorations. A bedroom with\r\ngas in it was what he was used to, was what he wanted, and was what he\r\nwas determined to have. The compliant manager volunteered to ask some\r\nother gentleman, housed on the inferior upper storey (which was lit\r\nthroughout with gas), to change rooms. Hearing this, and being quite\r\nwilling to exchange a small bedchamber for a large one, Henry\r\nvolunteered to be the other gentleman. The excellent American shook\r\nhands with him on the spot. \'You are a cultured person, sir,\' he said;\r\n\'and you will no doubt understand the decorations.\'\r\n\r\nHenry looked at the number of the room on the door as he opened it.\r\nThe number was Fourteen.\r\n\r\nTired and sleepy, he naturally anticipated a good night\'s rest. In the\r\nthoroughly healthy state of his nervous system, he slept as well in a\r\nbed abroad as in a bed at home. Without the slightest assignable\r\nreason, however, his just expectations were disappointed. The\r\nluxurious bed, the well-ventilated room, the delicious tranquillity of\r\nVenice by night, all were in favour of his sleeping well. He never\r\nslept at all. An indescribable sense of depression and discomfort kept\r\nhim waking through darkness and daylight alike. He went down to the\r\ncoffee-room as soon as the hotel was astir, and ordered some breakfast.\r\nAnother unaccountable change in himself appeared with the appearance of\r\nthe meal. He was absolutely without appetite. An excellent omelette,\r\nand cutlets cooked to perfection, he sent away untasted--he, whose\r\nappetite never failed him, whose digestion was still equal to any\r\ndemands on it!\r\n\r\nThe day was bright and fine. He sent for a gondola, and was rowed to\r\nthe Lido.\r\n\r\nOut on the airy Lagoon, he felt like a new man. He had not left the\r\nhotel ten minutes before he was fast asleep in the gondola. Waking, on\r\nreaching the landing-place, he crossed the Lido, and enjoyed a\r\nmorning\'s swim in the Adriatic. There was only a poor restaurant on\r\nthe island, in those days; but his appetite was now ready for anything;\r\nhe ate whatever was offered to him, like a famished man. He could\r\nhardly believe, when he reflected on it, that he had sent away untasted\r\nhis excellent breakfast at the hotel.\r\n\r\nReturning to Venice, he spent the rest of the day in the\r\npicture-galleries and the churches. Towards six o\'clock his gondola\r\ntook him back, with another fine appetite, to meet some travelling\r\nacquaintances with whom he had engaged to dine at the table d\'hote.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was deservedly rewarded with the highest approval by every\r\nguest in the hotel but one. To Henry\'s astonishment, the appetite with\r\nwhich he had entered the house mysteriously and completely left him\r\nwhen he sat down to table. He could drink some wine, but he could\r\nliterally eat nothing. \'What in the world is the matter with you?\' his\r\ntravelling acquaintances asked. He could honestly answer, \'I know no\r\nmore than you do.\'\r\n\r\nWhen night came, he gave his comfortable and beautiful bedroom another\r\ntrial. The result of the second experiment was a repetition of the\r\nresult of the first. Again he felt the all-pervading sense of\r\ndepression and discomfort. Again he passed a sleepless night. And\r\nonce more, when he tried to eat his breakfast, his appetite completely\r\nfailed him!\r\n\r\nThis personal experience of the new hotel was too extraordinary to be\r\npassed over in silence. Henry mentioned it to his friends in the\r\npublic room, in the hearing of the manager. The manager, naturally\r\nzealous in defence of the hotel, was a little hurt at the implied\r\nreflection cast on Number Fourteen. He invited the travellers present\r\nto judge for themselves whether Mr. Westwick\'s bedroom was to blame for\r\nMr. Westwick\'s sleepless nights; and he especially appealed to a\r\ngrey-headed gentleman, a guest at the breakfast-table of an English\r\ntraveller, to take the lead in the investigation. \'This is Doctor\r\nBruno, our first physician in Venice,\' he explained. \'I appeal to him\r\nto say if there are any unhealthy influences in Mr. Westwick\'s room.\'\r\n\r\nIntroduced to Number Fourteen, the doctor looked round him with a\r\ncertain appearance of interest which was noticed by everyone present.\r\n\'The last time I was in this room,\' he said, \'was on a melancholy\r\noccasion. It was before the palace was changed into an hotel. I was\r\nin professional attendance on an English nobleman who died here.\' One\r\nof the persons present inquired the name of the nobleman. Doctor Bruno\r\nanswered (without the slightest suspicion that he was speaking before a\r\nbrother of the dead man), \'Lord Montbarry.\'\r\n\r\nHenry quietly left the room, without saying a word to anybody.\r\n\r\nHe was not, in any sense of the term, a superstitious man. But he\r\nfelt, nevertheless, an insurmountable reluctance to remaining in the\r\nhotel. He decided on leaving Venice. To ask for another room would\r\nbe, as he could plainly see, an offence in the eyes of the manager. To\r\nremove to another hotel, would be to openly abandon an establishment in\r\nthe success of which he had a pecuniary interest. Leaving a note for\r\nArthur Barville, on his arrival in Venice, in which he merely mentioned\r\nthat he had gone to look at the Italian lakes, and that a line\r\naddressed to his hotel at Milan would bring him back again, he took the\r\nafternoon train to Padua--and dined with his usual appetite, and slept\r\nas well as ever that night.\r\n\r\nThe next day, a gentleman and his wife (perfect strangers to the\r\nMontbarry family), returning to England by way of Venice, arrived at\r\nthe hotel and occupied Number Fourteen.\r\n\r\nStill mindful of the slur that had been cast on one of his best\r\nbedchambers, the manager took occasion to ask the travellers the next\r\nmorning how they liked their room. They left him to judge for himself\r\nhow well they were satisfied, by remaining a day longer in Venice than\r\nthey had originally planned to do, solely for the purpose of enjoying\r\nthe excellent accommodation offered to them by the new hotel. \'We have\r\nmet with nothing like it in Italy,\' they said; \'you may rely on our\r\nrecommending you to all our friends.\'\r\n\r\nOn the day when Number Fourteen was again vacant, an English lady\r\ntravelling alone with her maid arrived at the hotel, saw the room, and\r\nat once engaged it.\r\n\r\nThe lady was Mrs. Norbury. She had left Francis Westwick at Milan,\r\noccupied in negotiating for the appearance at his theatre of the new\r\ndancer at the Scala. Not having heard to the contrary, Mrs. Norbury\r\nsupposed that Arthur Barville and his wife had already arrived at\r\nVenice. She was more interested in meeting the young married couple\r\nthan in awaiting the result of the hard bargaining which delayed the\r\nengagement of the new dancer; and she volunteered to make her brother\'s\r\napologies, if his theatrical business caused him to be late in keeping\r\nhis appointment at the honeymoon festival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norbury\'s experience of Number Fourteen differed entirely from her\r\nbrother Henry\'s experience of the room.\r\n\r\nFalling asleep as readily as usual, her repose was disturbed by a\r\nsuccession of frightful dreams; the central figure in every one of them\r\nbeing the figure of her dead brother, the first Lord Montbarry. She\r\nsaw him starving in a loathsome prison; she saw him pursued by\r\nassassins, and dying under their knives; she saw him drowning in\r\nimmeasurable depths of dark water; she saw him in a bed on fire,\r\nburning to death in the flames; she saw him tempted by a shadowy\r\ncreature to drink, and dying of the poisonous draught. The reiterated\r\nhorror of these dreams had such an effect on her that she rose with the\r\ndawn of day, afraid to trust herself again in bed. In the old times,\r\nshe had been noted in the family as the one member of it who lived on\r\naffectionate terms with Montbarry. His other sister and his brothers\r\nwere constantly quarrelling with him. Even his mother owned that her\r\neldest son was of all her children the child whom she least liked.\r\nSensible and resolute woman as she was, Mrs. Norbury shuddered with\r\nterror as she sat at the window of her room, watching the sunrise, and\r\nthinking of her dreams.\r\n\r\nShe made the first excuse that occurred to her, when her maid came in\r\nat the usual hour, and noticed how ill she looked. The woman was of so\r\nsuperstitious a temperament that it would have been in the last degree\r\nindiscreet to trust her with the truth. Mrs. Norbury merely remarked\r\nthat she had not found the bed quite to her liking, on account of the\r\nlarge size of it. She was accustomed at home, as her maid knew, to\r\nsleep in a small bed. Informed of this objection later in the day, the\r\nmanager regretted that he could only offer to the lady the choice of\r\none other bedchamber, numbered Thirty-eight, and situated immediately\r\nover the bedchamber which she desired to leave. Mrs. Norbury accepted\r\nthe proposed change of quarters. She was now about to pass her second\r\nnight in the room occupied in the old days of the palace by Baron Rivar.\r\n\r\nOnce more, she fell asleep as usual. And, once more, the frightful\r\ndreams of the first night terrified her, following each other in the\r\nsame succession. This time her nerves, already shaken, were not equal\r\nto the renewed torture of terror inflicted on them. She threw on her\r\ndressing-gown, and rushed out of her room in the middle of the night.\r\nThe porter, alarmed by the banging of the door, met her hurrying\r\nheadlong down the stairs, in search of the first human being she could\r\nfind to keep her company. Considerably surprised at this last new\r\nmanifestation of the famous \'English eccentricity,\' the man looked at\r\nthe hotel register, and led the lady upstairs again to the room\r\noccupied by her maid. The maid was not asleep, and, more wonderful\r\nstill, was not even undressed. She received her mistress quietly.\r\nWhen they were alone, and when Mrs. Norbury had, as a matter of\r\nnecessity, taken her attendant into her confidence, the woman made a\r\nvery strange reply.\r\n\r\n\'I have been asking about the hotel, at the servants\' supper to-night,\'\r\nshe said. \'The valet of one of the gentlemen staying here has heard\r\nthat the late Lord Montbarry was the last person who lived in the\r\npalace, before it was made into an hotel. The room he died in, ma\'am,\r\nwas the room you slept in last night. Your room tonight is the room\r\njust above it. I said nothing for fear of frightening you. For my own\r\npart, I have passed the night as you see, keeping my light on, and\r\nreading my Bible. In my opinion, no member of your family can hope to\r\nbe happy or comfortable in this house.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Please to let me explain myself, ma\'am. When Mr. Henry Westwick was\r\nhere (I have this from the valet, too) he occupied the room his brother\r\ndied in (without knowing it), like you. For two nights he never closed\r\nhis eyes. Without any reason for it (the valet heard him tell the\r\ngentlemen in the coffee-room) he could not sleep; he felt so low and so\r\nwretched in himself. And what is more, when daytime came, he couldn\'t\r\neven eat while he was under this roof. You may laugh at me, ma\'am--but\r\neven a servant may draw her own conclusions. It\'s my conclusion that\r\nsomething happened to my lord, which we none of us know about, when he\r\ndied in this house. His ghost walks in torment until he can tell\r\nit--and the living persons related to him are the persons who feel he\r\nis near them. Those persons may yet see him in the time to come.\r\nDon\'t, pray don\'t stay any longer in this dreadful place! I wouldn\'t\r\nstay another night here myself--no, not for anything that could be\r\noffered me!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Norbury at once set her servant\'s mind at ease on this last point.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think about it as you do,\' she said gravely. \'But I should\r\nlike to speak to my brother of what has happened. We will go back to\r\nMilan.\'\r\n\r\nSome hours necessarily elapsed before they could leave the hotel, by\r\nthe first train in the forenoon.\r\n\r\nIn that interval, Mrs. Norbury\'s maid found an opportunity of\r\nconfidentially informing the valet of what had passed between her\r\nmistress and herself. The valet had other friends to whom he related\r\nthe circumstances in his turn. In due course of time, the narrative,\r\npassing from mouth to mouth, reached the ears of the manager. He\r\ninstantly saw that the credit of the hotel was in danger, unless\r\nsomething was done to retrieve the character of the room numbered\r\nFourteen. English travellers, well acquainted with the peerage of\r\ntheir native country, informed him that Henry Westwick and Mrs. Norbury\r\nwere by no means the only members of the Montbarry family. Curiosity\r\nmight bring more of them to the hotel, after hearing what had happened.\r\nThe manager\'s ingenuity easily hit on the obvious means of misleading\r\nthem, in this case. The numbers of all the rooms were enamelled in\r\nblue, on white china plates, screwed to the doors. He ordered a new\r\nplate to be prepared, bearing the number, \'13 A\'; and he kept the room\r\nempty, after its tenant for the time being had gone away, until the\r\nplate was ready. He then re-numbered the room; placing the removed\r\nNumber Fourteen on the door of his own room (on the second floor),\r\nwhich, not being to let, had not previously been numbered at all. By\r\nthis device, Number Fourteen disappeared at once and for ever from the\r\nbooks of the hotel, as the number of a bedroom to let.\r\n\r\nHaving warned the servants to beware of gossiping with travellers, on\r\nthe subject of the changed numbers, under penalty of being dismissed,\r\nthe manager composed his mind with the reflection that he had done his\r\nduty to his employers. \'Now,\' he thought to himself, with an excusable\r\nsense of triumph, \'let the whole family come here if they like! The\r\nhotel is a match for them.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the week, the manager found himself in relations with\r\n\'the family\' once more. A telegram from Milan announced that Mr.\r\nFrancis Westwick would arrive in Venice on the next day; and would be\r\nobliged if Number Fourteen, on the first floor, could be reserved for\r\nhim, in the event of its being vacant at the time.\r\n\r\nThe manager paused to consider, before he issued his directions.\r\n\r\nThe re-numbered room had been last let to a French gentleman. It would\r\nbe occupied on the day of Mr. Francis Westwick\'s arrival, but it would\r\nbe empty again on the day after. Would it be well to reserve the room\r\nfor the special occupation of Mr. Francis? and when he had passed the\r\nnight unsuspiciously and comfortably in \'No. 13 A,\' to ask him in the\r\npresence of witnesses how he liked his bedchamber? In this case, if\r\nthe reputation of the room happened to be called in question again, the\r\nanswer would vindicate it, on the evidence of a member of the very\r\nfamily which had first given Number Fourteen a bad name. After a\r\nlittle reflection, the manager decided on trying the experiment, and\r\ndirected that \'13 A\' should be reserved accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Francis Westwick arrived in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\nHe had signed agreements with the most popular dancer in Italy; he had\r\ntransferred the charge of Mrs. Norbury to his brother Henry, who had\r\njoined him in Milan; and he was now at full liberty to amuse himself by\r\ntesting in every possible way the extraordinary influence exercised\r\nover his relatives by the new hotel. When his brother and sister first\r\ntold him what their experience had been, he instantly declared that he\r\nwould go to Venice in the interest of his theatre. The circumstances\r\nrelated to him contained invaluable hints for a ghost-drama. The title\r\noccurred to him in the railway: \'The Haunted Hotel.\' Post that in red\r\nletters six feet high, on a black ground, all over London--and trust\r\nthe excitable public to crowd into the theatre!\r\n\r\nReceived with the politest attention by the manager, Francis met with a\r\ndisappointment on entering the hotel. \'Some mistake, sir. No such\r\nroom on the first floor as Number Fourteen. The room bearing that\r\nnumber is on the second floor, and has been occupied by me, from the\r\nday when the hotel opened. Perhaps you meant number 13 A, on the first\r\nfloor? It will be at your service to-morrow--a charming room. In the\r\nmean time, we will do the best we can for you, to-night.\'\r\n\r\nA man who is the successful manager of a theatre is probably the last\r\nman in the civilized universe who is capable of being impressed with\r\nfavourable opinions of his fellow-creatures. Francis privately set the\r\nmanager down as a humbug, and the story about the numbering of the\r\nrooms as a lie.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his arrival, he dined by himself in the restaurant,\r\nbefore the hour of the table d\'hote, for the express purpose of\r\nquestioning the waiter, without being overheard by anybody. The answer\r\nled him to the conclusion that \'13 A\' occupied the situation in the\r\nhotel which had been described by his brother and sister as the\r\nsituation of \'14.\' He asked next for the Visitors\' List; and found that\r\nthe French gentleman who then occupied \'13 A,\' was the proprietor of a\r\ntheatre in Paris, personally well known to him. Was the gentleman then\r\nin the hotel? He had gone out, but would certainly return for the\r\ntable d\'hote. When the public dinner was over, Francis entered the\r\nroom, and was welcomed by his Parisian colleague, literally, with open\r\narms. \'Come and have a cigar in my room,\' said the friendly Frenchman.\r\n\'I want to hear whether you have really engaged that woman at Milan or\r\nnot.\' In this easy way, Francis found his opportunity of comparing the\r\ninterior of the room with the description which he had heard of it at\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nArriving at the door, the Frenchman bethought himself of his travelling\r\ncompanion. \'My scene-painter is here with me,\' he said, \'on the\r\nlook-out for materials. An excellent fellow, who will take it as a\r\nkindness if we ask him to join us. I\'ll tell the porter to send him up\r\nwhen he comes in.\' He handed the key of his room to Francis. \'I will\r\nbe back in a minute. It\'s at the end of the corridor--13 A.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis entered the room alone. There were the decorations on the\r\nwalls and the ceiling, exactly as they had been described to him! He\r\nhad just time to perceive this at a glance, before his attention was\r\ndiverted to himself and his own sensations, by a grotesquely\r\ndisagreeable occurrence which took him completely by surprise.\r\n\r\nHe became conscious of a mysteriously offensive odour in the room,\r\nentirely new in his experience of revolting smells. It was composed\r\n(if such a thing could be) of two mingling exhalations, which were\r\nseparately-discoverable exhalations nevertheless. This strange\r\nblending of odours consisted of something faintly and unpleasantly\r\naromatic, mixed with another underlying smell, so unutterably sickening\r\nthat he threw open the window, and put his head out into the fresh air,\r\nunable to endure the horribly infected atmosphere for a moment longer.\r\n\r\nThe French proprietor joined his English friend, with his cigar already\r\nlit. He started back in dismay at a sight terrible to his countrymen\r\nin general--the sight of an open window. \'You English people are\r\nperfectly mad on the subject of fresh air!\' he exclaimed. \'We shall\r\ncatch our deaths of cold.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis turned, and looked at him in astonishment. \'Are you really not\r\naware of the smell there is in the room?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Smell!\' repeated his brother-manager. \'I smell my own good cigar. Try\r\none yourself. And for Heaven\'s sake shut the window!\'\r\n\r\nFrancis declined the cigar by a sign. \'Forgive me,\' he said. \'I will\r\nleave you to close the window. I feel faint and giddy--I had better go\r\nout.\' He put his handkerchief over his nose and mouth, and crossed the\r\nroom to the door.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman followed the movements of Francis, in such a state of\r\nbewilderment that he actually forgot to seize the opportunity of\r\nshutting out the fresh air. \'Is it so nasty as that?\' he asked, with a\r\nbroad stare of amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Horrible!\' Francis muttered behind his handkerchief. \'I never smelt\r\nanything like it in my life!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. The scene-painter appeared. His\r\nemployer instantly asked him if he smelt anything.\r\n\r\n\'I smell your cigar. Delicious! Give me one directly!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minute. Besides my cigar, do you smell anything else--vile,\r\nabominable, overpowering, indescribable, never-never-never-smelt\r\nbefore?\'\r\n\r\nThe scene-painter appeared to be puzzled by the vehement energy of the\r\nlanguage addressed to him. \'The room is as fresh and sweet as a room\r\ncan be,\' he answered. As he spoke, he looked back with astonishment at\r\nFrancis Westwick, standing outside in the corridor, and eyeing the\r\ninterior of the bedchamber with an expression of undisguised disgust.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian director approached his English colleague, and looked at\r\nhim with grave and anxious scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\'You see, my friend, here are two of us, with as good noses as yours,\r\nwho smell nothing. If you want evidence from more noses, look there!\'\r\nHe pointed to two little English girls, at play in the corridor. \'The\r\ndoor of my room is wide open--and you know how fast a smell can travel.\r\nNow listen, while I appeal to these innocent noses, in the language of\r\ntheir own dismal island. My little loves, do you sniff a nasty smell\r\nhere--ha?\' The children burst out laughing, and answered emphatically,\r\n\'No.\' \'My good Westwick,\' the Frenchman resumed, in his own language,\r\n\'the conclusion is surely plain? There is something wrong, very wrong,\r\nwith your own nose. I recommend you to see a medical man.\'\r\n\r\nHaving given that advice, he returned to his room, and shut out the\r\nhorrid fresh air with a loud exclamation of relief. Francis left the\r\nhotel, by the lanes that led to the Square of St. Mark. The\r\nnight-breeze soon revived him. He was able to light a cigar, and to\r\nthink quietly over what had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAvoiding the crowd under the colonnades, Francis walked slowly up and\r\ndown the noble open space of the square, bathed in the light of the\r\nrising moon.\r\n\r\nWithout being aware of it himself, he was a thorough materialist. The\r\nstrange effect produced on him by the room--following on the other\r\nstrange effects produced on the other relatives of his dead\r\nbrother--exercised no perplexing influence over the mind of this\r\nsensible man. \'Perhaps,\' he reflected, \'my temperament is more\r\nimaginative than I supposed it to be--and this is a trick played on me\r\nby my own fancy? Or, perhaps, my friend is right; something is\r\nphysically amiss with me? I don\'t feel ill, certainly. But that is no\r\nsafe criterion sometimes. I am not going to sleep in that abominable\r\nroom to-night--I can well wait till to-morrow to decide whether I shall\r\nspeak to a doctor or not. In the mean time, the hotel doesn\'t seem\r\nlikely to supply me with the subject of a piece. A terrible smell from\r\nan invisible ghost is a perfectly new idea. But it has one drawback.\r\nIf I realise it on the stage, I shall drive the audience out of the\r\ntheatre.\'\r\n\r\nAs his strong common sense arrived at this facetious conclusion, he\r\nbecame aware of a lady, dressed entirely in black, who was observing\r\nhim with marked attention. \'Am I right in supposing you to be Mr.\r\nFrancis Westwick?\' the lady asked, at the moment when he looked at her.\r\n\r\n\'That is my name, madam. May I inquire to whom I have the honour of\r\nspeaking?\'\r\n\r\n\'We have only met once,\' she answered a little evasively, \'when your\r\nlate brother introduced me to the members of his family. I wonder if\r\nyou have quite forgotten my big black eyes and my hideous complexion?\'\r\nShe lifted her veil as she spoke, and turned so that the moonlight\r\nrested on her face.\r\n\r\nFrancis recognised at a glance the woman of all others whom he most\r\ncordially disliked--the widow of his dead brother, the first Lord\r\nMontbarry. He frowned as he looked at her. His experience on the\r\nstage, gathered at innumerable rehearsals with actresses who had sorely\r\ntried his temper, had accustomed him to speak roughly to women who were\r\ndistasteful to him. \'I remember you,\' he said. \'I thought you were in\r\nAmerica!\'\r\n\r\nShe took no notice of his ungracious tone and manner; she simply\r\nstopped him when he lifted his hat, and turned to leave her.\r\n\r\n\'Let me walk with you for a few minutes,\' she quietly replied. \'I have\r\nsomething to say to you.\'\r\n\r\nHe showed her his cigar. \'I am smoking,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind smoking.\'\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was nothing to be done (short of downright brutality)\r\nbut to yield. He did it with the worst possible grace. \'Well?\' he\r\nresumed. \'What do you want of me?\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall hear directly, Mr. Westwick. Let me first tell you what my\r\nposition is. I am alone in the world. To the loss of my husband has\r\nnow been added another bereavement, the loss of my companion in\r\nAmerica, my brother--Baron Rivar.\'\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the Baron, and the doubt which scandal had thrown on\r\nhis assumed relationship to the Countess, were well known to Francis.\r\n\'Shot in a gambling-saloon?\' he asked brutally.\r\n\r\n\'The question is a perfectly natural one on your part,\' she said, with\r\nthe impenetrably ironical manner which she could assume on certain\r\noccasions. \'As a native of horse-racing England, you belong to a\r\nnation of gamblers. My brother died no extraordinary death, Mr.\r\nWestwick. He sank, with many other unfortunate people, under a fever\r\nprevalent in a Western city which we happened to visit. The calamity\r\nof his loss made the United States unendurable to me. I left by the\r\nfirst steamer that sailed from New York--a French vessel which brought\r\nme to Havre. I continued my lonely journey to the South of France.\r\nAnd then I went on to Venice.\'\r\n\r\n\'What does all this matter to me?\' Francis thought to himself. She\r\npaused, evidently expecting him to say something. \'So you have come to\r\nVenice?\' he said carelessly. \'Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because I couldn\'t help it,\' she answered.\r\n\r\nFrancis looked at her with cynical curiosity. \'That sounds odd,\' he\r\nremarked. \'Why couldn\'t you help it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Women are accustomed to act on impulse,\' she explained. \'Suppose we\r\nsay that an impulse has directed my journey? And yet, this is the last\r\nplace in the world that I wish to find myself in. Associations that I\r\ndetest are connected with it in my mind. If I had a will of my own, I\r\nwould never see it again. I hate Venice. As you see, however, I am\r\nhere. When did you meet with such an unreasonable woman before?\r\nNever, I am sure!\' She stopped, eyed him for a moment, and suddenly\r\naltered her tone. \'When is Miss Agnes Lockwood expected to be in\r\nVenice?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to throw Francis off his balance, but that\r\nextraordinary question did it. \'How the devil did you know that Miss\r\nLockwood was coming to Venice?\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe laughed--a bitter mocking laugh. \'Say, I guessed it!\'\r\n\r\nSomething in her tone, or perhaps something in the audacious defiance\r\nof her eyes as they rested on him, roused the quick temper that was in\r\nFrancis Westwick. \'Lady Montbarry--!\' he began.\r\n\r\n\'Stop there!\' she interposed. \'Your brother Stephen\'s wife calls\r\nherself Lady Montbarry now. I share my title with no woman. Call me\r\nby my name before I committed the fatal mistake of marrying your\r\nbrother. Address me, if you please, as Countess Narona.\'\r\n\r\n\'Countess Narona,\' Francis resumed, \'if your object in claiming my\r\nacquaintance is to mystify me, you have come to the wrong man. Speak\r\nplainly, or permit me to wish you good evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'If your object is to keep Miss Lockwood\'s arrival in Venice a secret,\'\r\nshe retorted, \'speak plainly, Mr. Westwick, on your side, and say so.\'\r\n\r\nHer intention was evidently to irritate him; and she succeeded.\r\n\'Nonsense!\' he broke out petulantly. \'My brother\'s travelling\r\narrangements are secrets to nobody. He brings Miss Lockwood here, with\r\nLady Montbarry and the children. As you seem so well informed, perhaps\r\nyou know why she is coming to Venice?\'\r\n\r\nThe Countess had suddenly become grave and thoughtful. She made no\r\nreply. The two strangely associated companions, having reached one\r\nextremity of the square, were now standing before the church of St.\r\nMark. The moonlight was bright enough to show the architecture of the\r\ngrand cathedral in its wonderful variety of detail. Even the pigeons\r\nof St. Mark were visible, in dark closely packed rows, roosting in the\r\narchways of the great entrance doors.\r\n\r\n\'I never saw the old church look so beautiful by moonlight,\' the\r\nCountess said quietly; speaking, not to Francis, but to herself.\r\n\'Good-bye, St. Mark\'s by moonlight! I shall not see you again.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the church, and saw Francis listening to her with\r\nwondering looks. \'No,\' she resumed, placidly picking up the lost\r\nthread of the conversation, \'I don\'t know why Miss Lockwood is coming\r\nhere, I only know that we are to meet in Venice.\'\r\n\r\n\'By previous appointment?\'\r\n\r\n\'By Destiny,\' she answered, with her head on her breast, and her eyes\r\non the ground. Francis burst out laughing. \'Or, if you like it\r\nbetter,\' she instantly resumed, \'by what fools call Chance.\' Francis\r\nanswered easily, out of the depths of his strong common sense. \'Chance\r\nseems to be taking a queer way of bringing the meeting about,\' he said.\r\n\'We have all arranged to meet at the Palace Hotel. How is it that your\r\nname is not on the Visitors\' List? Destiny ought to have brought you\r\nto the Palace Hotel too.\'\r\n\r\nShe abruptly pulled down her veil. \'Destiny may do that yet!\' she\r\nsaid. \'The Palace Hotel?\' she repeated, speaking once more to herself.\r\n\'The old hell, transformed into the new purgatory. The place itself!\r\nJesu Maria! the place itself!\' She paused and laid her hand on her\r\ncompanion\'s arm. \'Perhaps Miss Lockwood is not going there with the\r\nrest of you?\' she burst out with sudden eagerness. \'Are you positively\r\nsure she will be at the hotel?\'\r\n\r\n\'Positively! Haven\'t I told you that Miss Lockwood travels with Lord\r\nand Lady Montbarry? and don\'t you know that she is a member of the\r\nfamily? You will have to move, Countess, to our hotel.\'\r\n\r\nShe was perfectly impenetrable to the bantering tone in which he spoke.\r\n\'Yes,\' she said faintly, \'I shall have to move to your hotel.\' Her hand\r\nwas still on his arm--he could feel her shivering from head to foot\r\nwhile she spoke. Heartily as he disliked and distrusted her, the\r\ncommon instinct of humanity obliged him to ask if she felt cold.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she said. \'Cold and faint.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cold and faint, Countess, on such a night as this?\'\r\n\r\n\'The night has nothing to do with it, Mr. Westwick. How do you suppose\r\nthe criminal feels on the scaffold, while the hangman is putting the\r\nrope around his neck? Cold and faint, too, I should think. Excuse my\r\ngrim fancy. You see, Destiny has got the rope round my neck--and I\r\nfeel it.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked about her. They were at that moment close to the famous\r\ncafe known as \'Florian\'s.\' \'Take me in there,\' she said; \'I must have\r\nsomething to revive me. You had better not hesitate. You are\r\ninterested in reviving me. I have not said what I wanted to say to you\r\nyet. It\'s business, and it\'s connected with your theatre.\'\r\n\r\nWondering inwardly what she could possibly want with his theatre,\r\nFrancis reluctantly yielded to the necessities of the situation, and\r\ntook her into the cafe. He found a quiet corner in which they could\r\ntake their places without attracting notice. \'What will you have?\' he\r\ninquired resignedly. She gave her own orders to the waiter, without\r\ntroubling him to speak for her.\r\n\r\n\'Maraschino. And a pot of tea.\'\r\n\r\nThe waiter stared; Francis stared. The tea was a novelty (in\r\nconnection with maraschino) to both of them. Careless whether she\r\nsurprised them or not, she instructed the waiter, when her directions\r\nhad been complied with, to pour a large wine-glass-full of the liqueur\r\ninto a tumbler, and to fill it up from the teapot. \'I can\'t do it for\r\nmyself,\' she remarked, \'my hand trembles so.\' She drank the strange\r\nmixture eagerly, hot as it was. \'Maraschino punch--will you taste some\r\nof it?\' she said. \'I inherit the discovery of this drink. When your\r\nEnglish Queen Caroline was on the Continent, my mother was attached to\r\nher Court. That much injured Royal Person invented, in her happier\r\nhours, maraschino punch. Fondly attached to her gracious mistress, my\r\nmother shared her tastes. And I, in my turn, learnt from my mother.\r\nNow, Mr. Westwick, suppose I tell you what my business is. You are\r\nmanager of a theatre. Do you want a new play?\'\r\n\r\n\'I always want a new play--provided it\'s a good one.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you pay, if it\'s a good one?\'\r\n\r\n\'I pay liberally--in my own interests.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I write the play, will you read it?\'\r\n\r\nFrancis hesitated. \'What has put writing a play into your head?\' he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\'Mere accident,\' she answered. \'I had once occasion to tell my late\r\nbrother of a visit which I paid to Miss Lockwood, when I was last in\r\nEngland. He took no interest at what happened at the interview, but\r\nsomething struck him in my way of relating it. He said, "You describe\r\nwhat passed between you and the lady with the point and contrast of\r\ngood stage dialogue. You have the dramatic instinct--try if you can\r\nwrite a play. You might make money." That put it into my head.\'\r\n\r\nThose last words seemed to startle Francis. \'Surely you don\'t want\r\nmoney!\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'I always want money. My tastes are expensive. I have nothing but my\r\npoor little four hundred a year--and the wreck that is left of the\r\nother money: about two hundred pounds in circular notes--no more.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis knew that she was referring to the ten thousand pounds paid by\r\nthe insurance offices. \'All those thousands gone already!\' he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe blew a little puff of air over her fingers. \'Gone like that!\' she\r\nanswered coolly.\r\n\r\n\'Baron Rivar?\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a flash of anger in her hard black eyes.\r\n\r\n\'My affairs are my own secret, Mr. Westwick. I have made you a\r\nproposal--and you have not answered me yet. Don\'t say No, without\r\nthinking first. Remember what a life mine has been. I have seen more\r\nof the world than most people, playwrights included. I have had\r\nstrange adventures; I have heard remarkable stories; I have observed; I\r\nhave remembered. Are there no materials, here in my head, for writing\r\na play--if the opportunity is granted to me?\' She waited a moment, and\r\nsuddenly repeated her strange question about Agnes.\r\n\r\n\'When is Miss Lockwood expected to be in Venice?\'\r\n\r\n\'What has that to do with your new play, Countess?\'\r\n\r\nThe Countess appeared to feel some difficulty in giving that question\r\nits fit reply. She mixed another tumbler full of maraschino punch, and\r\ndrank one good half of it before she spoke again.\r\n\r\n\'It has everything to do with my new play,\' was all she said. \'Answer\r\nme.\' Francis answered her.\r\n\r\n\'Miss Lockwood may be here in a week. Or, for all I know to the\r\ncontrary, sooner than that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well. If I am a living woman and a free woman in a week\'s\r\ntime--or if I am in possession of my senses in a week\'s time (don\'t\r\ninterrupt me; I know what I am talking about)--I shall have a sketch or\r\noutline of my play ready, as a specimen of what I can do. Once again,\r\nwill you read it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will certainly read it. But, Countess, I don\'t understand--\'\r\n\r\nShe held up her hand for silence, and finished the second tumbler of\r\nmaraschino punch.\r\n\r\n\'I am a living enigma--and you want to know the right reading of me,\'\r\nshe said. \'Here is the reading, as your English phrase goes, in a\r\nnutshell. There is a foolish idea in the minds of many persons that\r\nthe natives of the warm climates are imaginative people. There never\r\nwas a greater mistake. You will find no such unimaginative people\r\nanywhere as you find in Italy, Spain, Greece, and the other Southern\r\ncountries. To anything fanciful, to anything spiritual, their minds\r\nare deaf and blind by nature. Now and then, in the course of\r\ncenturies, a great genius springs up among them; and he is the\r\nexception which proves the rule. Now see! I, though I am no genius--I\r\nam, in my little way (as I suppose), an exception too. To my sorrow, I\r\nhave some of that imagination which is so common among the English and\r\nthe Germans--so rare among the Italians, the Spaniards, and the rest of\r\nthem! And what is the result? I think it has become a disease in me.\r\nI am filled with presentiments which make this wicked life of mine one\r\nlong terror to me. It doesn\'t matter, just now, what they are. Enough\r\nthat they absolutely govern me--they drive me over land and sea at\r\ntheir own horrible will; they are in me, and torturing me, at this\r\nmoment! Why don\'t I resist them? Ha! but I do resist them. I am\r\ntrying (with the help of the good punch) to resist them now. At\r\nintervals I cultivate the difficult virtue of common sense. Sometimes,\r\nsound sense makes a hopeful woman of me. At one time, I had the hope\r\nthat what seemed reality to me was only mad delusion, after all--I even\r\nasked the question of an English doctor! At other times, other\r\nsensible doubts of myself beset me. Never mind dwelling on them\r\nnow--it always ends in the old terrors and superstitions taking\r\npossession of me again. In a week\'s time, I shall know whether Destiny\r\ndoes indeed decide my future for me, or whether I decide it for myself.\r\nIn the last case, my resolution is to absorb this self-tormenting fancy\r\nof mine in the occupation that I have told you of already. Do you\r\nunderstand me a little better now? And, our business being settled,\r\ndear Mr. Westwick, shall we get out of this hot room into the nice cool\r\nair again?\'\r\n\r\nThey rose to leave the cafe. Francis privately concluded that the\r\nmaraschino punch offered the only discoverable explanation of what the\r\nCountess had said to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Shall I see you again?\' she asked, as she held out her hand to take\r\nleave. \'It is quite understood between us, I suppose, about the play?\'\r\n\r\nFrancis recalled his extraordinary experience of that evening in the\r\nre-numbered room. \'My stay in Venice is uncertain,\' he replied. \'If\r\nyou have anything more to say about this dramatic venture of yours, it\r\nmay be as well to say it now. Have you decided on a subject already?\r\nI know the public taste in England better than you do--I might save you\r\nsome waste of time and trouble, if you have not chosen your subject\r\nwisely.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t care what subject I write about, so long as I write,\' she\r\nanswered carelessly. \'If you have got a subject in your head, give it\r\nto me. I answer for the characters and the dialogue.\'\r\n\r\n\'You answer for the characters and the dialogue,\' Francis repeated.\r\n\'That\'s a bold way of speaking for a beginner! I wonder if I should\r\nshake your sublime confidence in yourself, if I suggested the most\r\nticklish subject to handle which is known to the stage? What do you\r\nsay, Countess, to entering the lists with Shakespeare, and trying a\r\ndrama with a ghost in it? A true story, mind! founded on events in\r\nthis very city in which you and I are interested.\'\r\n\r\nShe caught him by the arm, and drew him away from the crowded colonnade\r\ninto the solitary middle space of the square. \'Now tell me!\' she said\r\neagerly. \'Here, where nobody is near us. How am I interested in it?\r\nHow? how?\'\r\n\r\nStill holding his arm, she shook him in her impatience to hear the\r\ncoming disclosure. For a moment he hesitated. Thus far, amused by her\r\nignorant belief in herself, he had merely spoken in jest. Now, for the\r\nfirst time, impressed by her irresistible earnestness, he began to\r\nconsider what he was about from a more serious point of view. With her\r\nknowledge of all that had passed in the old palace, before its\r\ntransformation into an hotel, it was surely possible that she might\r\nsuggest some explanation of what had happened to his brother, and\r\nsister, and himself. Or, failing to do this, she might accidentally\r\nreveal some event in her own experience which, acting as a hint to a\r\ncompetent dramatist, might prove to be the making of a play. The\r\nprosperity of his theatre was his one serious object in life. \'I may\r\nbe on the trace of another "Corsican Brothers,"\' he thought. \'A new\r\npiece of that sort would be ten thousand pounds in my pocket, at least.\'\r\n\r\nWith these motives (worthy of the single-hearted devotion to dramatic\r\nbusiness which made Francis a successful manager) he related, without\r\nfurther hesitation, what his own experience had been, and what the\r\nexperience of his relatives had been, in the haunted hotel. He even\r\ndescribed the outbreak of superstitious terror which had escaped Mrs.\r\nNorbury\'s ignorant maid. \'Sad stuff, if you look at it reasonably,\' he\r\nremarked. \'But there is something dramatic in the notion of the\r\nghostly influence making itself felt by the relations in succession, as\r\nthey one after another enter the fatal room--until the one chosen\r\nrelative comes who will see the Unearthly Creature, and know the\r\nterrible truth. Material for a play, Countess--first-rate material for\r\na play!\'\r\n\r\nThere he paused. She neither moved nor spoke. He stooped and looked\r\ncloser at her.\r\n\r\nWhat impression had he produced? It was an impression which his utmost\r\ningenuity had failed to anticipate. She stood by his side--just as she\r\nhad stood before Agnes when her question about Ferrari was plainly\r\nanswered at last--like a woman turned to stone. Her eyes were vacant\r\nand rigid; all the life in her face had faded out of it. Francis took\r\nher by the hand. Her hand was as cold as the pavement that they were\r\nstanding on. He asked her if she was ill.\r\n\r\nNot a muscle in her moved. He might as well have spoken to the dead.\r\n\r\n\'Surely,\' he said, \'you are not foolish enough to take what I have been\r\ntelling you seriously?\'\r\n\r\nHer lips moved slowly. As it seemed, she was making an effort to speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\'Louder,\' he said. \'I can\'t hear you.\'\r\n\r\nShe struggled to recover possession of herself. A faint light began to\r\nsoften the dull cold stare of her eyes. In a moment more she spoke so\r\nthat he could hear her.\r\n\r\n\'I never thought of the other world,\' she murmured, in low dull tones,\r\nlike a woman talking in her sleep.\r\n\r\nHer mind had gone back to the day of her last memorable interview with\r\nAgnes; she was slowly recalling the confession that had escaped her,\r\nthe warning words which she had spoken at that past time. Necessarily\r\nincapable of understanding this, Francis looked at her in perplexity.\r\nShe went on in the same dull vacant tone, steadily following out her\r\nown train of thought, with her heedless eyes on his face, and her\r\nwandering mind far away from him.\r\n\r\n\'I said some trifling event would bring us together the next time. I\r\nwas wrong. No trifling event will bring us together. I said I might\r\nbe the person who told her what had become of Ferrari, if she forced me\r\nto it. Shall I feel some other influence than hers? Will he force me\r\nto it? When she sees him, shall I see him too?\'\r\n\r\nHer head sank a little; her heavy eyelids dropped slowly; she heaved a\r\nlong low weary sigh. Francis put her arm in his, and made an attempt\r\nto rouse her.\r\n\r\n\'Come, Countess, you are weary and over-wrought. We have had enough\r\ntalking to-night. Let me see you safe back to your hotel. Is it far\r\nfrom here?\'\r\n\r\nShe started when he moved, and obliged her to move with him, as if he\r\nhad suddenly awakened her out of a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n\'Not far,\' she said faintly. \'The old hotel on the quay. My mind\'s in\r\na strange state; I have forgotten the name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Danieli\'s?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\'\r\n\r\nHe led her on slowly. She accompanied him in silence as far as the end\r\nof the Piazzetta. There, when the full view of the moonlit Lagoon\r\nrevealed itself, she stopped him as he turned towards the Riva degli\r\nSchiavoni. \'I have something to ask you. I want to wait and think.\'\r\n\r\nShe recovered her lost idea, after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to sleep in the room to-night?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nHe told her that another traveller was in possession of the room that\r\nnight. \'But the manager has reserved it for me to-morrow,\' he added,\r\n\'if I wish to have it.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said. \'You must give it up.\'\r\n\r\n\'To whom?\'\r\n\r\n\'To me!\'\r\n\r\nHe started. \'After what I have told you, do you really wish to sleep\r\nin that room to-morrow night?\'\r\n\r\n\'I must sleep in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you not afraid?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am horribly afraid.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I should have thought, after what I have observed in you to-night.\r\nWhy should you take the room? You are not obliged to occupy it, unless\r\nyou like.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was not obliged to go to Venice, when I left America,\' she answered.\r\n\'And yet I came here. I must take the room, and keep the room,\r\nuntil--\' She broke off at those words. \'Never mind the rest,\' she\r\nsaid. \'It doesn\'t interest you.\'\r\n\r\nIt was useless to dispute with her. Francis changed the subject. \'We\r\ncan do nothing to-night,\' he said. \'I will call on you to-morrow\r\nmorning, and hear what you think of it then.\'\r\n\r\nThey moved on again to the hotel. As they approached the door, Francis\r\nasked if she was staying in Venice under her own name.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \'As your brother\'s widow, I am known here. As\r\nCountess Narona, I am known here. I want to be unknown, this time, to\r\nstrangers in Venice; I am travelling under a common English name.\' She\r\nhesitated, and stood still. \'What has come to me?\' she muttered to\r\nherself. \'Some things I remember; and some I forget. I forgot\r\nDanieli\'s--and now I forget my English name.\' She drew him hurriedly\r\ninto the hall of the hotel, on the wall of which hung a list of\r\nvisitors\' names. Running her finger slowly down the list, she pointed\r\nto the English name that she had assumed:--\'Mrs. James.\'\r\n\r\n\'Remember that when you call to-morrow,\' she said. \'My head is heavy.\r\nGood night.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis went back to his own hotel, wondering what the events of the\r\nnext day would bring forth. A new turn in his affairs had taken place\r\nin his absence. As he crossed the hall, he was requested by one of the\r\nservants to walk into the private office. The manager was waiting\r\nthere with a gravely pre-occupied manner, as if he had something\r\nserious to say. He regretted to hear that Mr. Francis Westwick had,\r\nlike other members of the family, discovered serious sources of\r\ndiscomfort in the new hotel. He had been informed in strict confidence\r\nof Mr. Westwick\'s extraordinary objection to the atmosphere of the\r\nbedroom upstairs. Without presuming to discuss the matter, he must beg\r\nto be excused from reserving the room for Mr. Westwick after what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nFrancis answered sharply, a little ruffled by the tone in which the\r\nmanager had spoken to him. \'I might, very possibly, have declined to\r\nsleep in the room, if you had reserved it,\' he said. \'Do you wish me\r\nto leave the hotel?\'\r\n\r\nThe manager saw the error that he had committed, and hastened to repair\r\nit. \'Certainly not, sir! We will do our best to make you comfortable\r\nwhile you stay with us. I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to\r\noffend you. The reputation of an establishment like this is a matter\r\nof very serious importance. May I hope that you will do us the great\r\nfavour to say nothing about what has happened upstairs? The two French\r\ngentlemen have kindly promised to keep it a secret.\'\r\n\r\nThis apology left Francis no polite alternative but to grant the\r\nmanager\'s request. \'There is an end to the Countess\'s wild scheme,\' he\r\nthought to himself, as he retired for the night. \'So much the better\r\nfor the Countess!\'\r\n\r\nHe rose late the next morning. Inquiring for his Parisian friends, he\r\nwas informed that both the French gentlemen had left for Milan. As he\r\ncrossed the hall, on his way to the restaurant, he noticed the head\r\nporter chalking the numbers of the rooms on some articles of luggage\r\nwhich were waiting to go upstairs. One trunk attracted his attention\r\nby the extraordinary number of old travelling labels left on it. The\r\nporter was marking it at the moment--and the number was, \'13 A.\'\r\nFrancis instantly looked at the card fastened on the lid. It bore the\r\ncommon English name, \'Mrs. James\'! He at once inquired about the lady.\r\nShe had arrived early that morning, and she was then in the Reading\r\nRoom. Looking into the room, he discovered a lady in it alone.\r\nAdvancing a little nearer, he found himself face to face with the\r\nCountess.\r\n\r\nShe was seated in a dark corner, with her head down and her arms\r\ncrossed over her bosom. \'Yes,\' she said, in a tone of weary\r\nimpatience, before Francis could speak to her. \'I thought it best not\r\nto wait for you--I determined to get here before anybody else could\r\ntake the room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you taken it for long?\' Francis asked.\r\n\r\n\'You told me Miss Lockwood would be here in a week\'s time. I have\r\ntaken it for a week.\'\r\n\r\n\'What has Miss Lockwood to do with it?\'\r\n\r\n\'She has everything to do with it--she must sleep in the room. I shall\r\ngive the room up to her when she comes here.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis began to understand the superstitious purpose that she had in\r\nview. \'Are you (an educated woman) really of the same opinion as my\r\nsister\'s maid!\' he exclaimed. \'Assuming your absurd superstition to be\r\na serious thing, you are taking the wrong means to prove it true. If I\r\nand my brother and sister have seen nothing, how should Agnes Lockwood\r\ndiscover what was not revealed to us? She is only distantly related to\r\nthe Montbarrys--she is only our cousin.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was nearer to the heart of the Montbarry who is dead than any of\r\nyou,\' the Countess answered sternly. \'To the last day of his life, my\r\nmiserable husband repented his desertion of her. She will see what\r\nnone of you have seen--she shall have the room.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis listened, utterly at a loss to account for the motives that\r\nanimated her. \'I don\'t see what interest you have in trying this\r\nextraordinary experiment,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'It is my interest not to try it! It is my interest to fly from\r\nVenice, and never set eyes on Agnes Lockwood or any of your family\r\nagain!\'\r\n\r\n\'What prevents you from doing that?\'\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet and looked at him wildly. \'I know no more what\r\nprevents me than you do!\' she burst out. \'Some will that is stronger\r\nthan mine drives me on to my destruction, in spite of my own self!\' She\r\nsuddenly sat down again, and waved her hand for him to go. \'Leave me,\'\r\nshe said. \'Leave me to my thoughts.\'\r\n\r\nFrancis left her, firmly persuaded by this time that she was out of her\r\nsenses. For the rest of the day, he saw nothing of her. The night, so\r\nfar as he knew, passed quietly. The next morning he breakfasted early,\r\ndetermining to wait in the restaurant for the appearance of the\r\nCountess. She came in and ordered her breakfast quietly, looking dull\r\nand worn and self-absorbed, as she had looked when he last saw her. He\r\nhastened to her table, and asked if anything had happened in the night.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' she answered.\r\n\r\n\'You have rested as well as usual?\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite as well as usual. Have you had any letters this morning? Have\r\nyou heard when she is coming?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have had no letters. Are you really going to stay here? Has your\r\nexperience of last night not altered the opinion which you expressed to\r\nme yesterday?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not in the least.\'\r\n\r\nThe momentary gleam of animation which had crossed her face when she\r\nquestioned him about Agnes, died out of it again when he answered her.\r\nShe looked, she spoke, she ate her breakfast, with a vacant\r\nresignation, like a woman who had done with hopes, done with interests,\r\ndone with everything but the mechanical movements and instincts of life.\r\n\r\nFrancis went out, on the customary travellers\' pilgrimage to the\r\nshrines of Titian and Tintoret. After some hours of absence, he found\r\na letter waiting for him when he got back to the hotel. It was written\r\nby his brother Henry, and it recommended him to return to Milan\r\nimmediately. The proprietor of a French theatre, recently arrived from\r\nVenice, was trying to induce the famous dancer whom Francis had engaged\r\nto break faith with him and accept a higher salary.\r\n\r\nHaving made this startling announcement, Henry proceeded to inform his\r\nbrother that Lord and Lady Montbarry, with Agnes and the children,\r\nwould arrive in Venice in three days more. \'They know nothing of our\r\nadventures at the hotel,\' Henry wrote; \'and they have telegraphed to\r\nthe manager for the accommodation that they want. There would be\r\nsomething absurdly superstitious in our giving them a warning which\r\nwould frighten the ladies and children out of the best hotel in Venice.\r\nWe shall be a strong party this time--too strong a party for ghosts! I\r\nshall meet the travellers on their arrival, of course, and try my luck\r\nagain at what you call the Haunted Hotel. Arthur Barville and his wife\r\nhave already got as far on their way as Trent; and two of the lady\'s\r\nrelations have arranged to accompany them on the journey to Venice.\'\r\n\r\nNaturally indignant at the conduct of his Parisian colleague, Francis\r\nmade his preparations for returning to Milan by the train of that day.\r\n\r\nOn his way out, he asked the manager if his brother\'s telegram had been\r\nreceived. The telegram had arrived, and, to the surprise of Francis,\r\nthe rooms were already reserved. \'I thought you would refuse to let\r\nany more of the family into the house,\' he said satirically. The\r\nmanager answered (with the due dash of respect) in the same tone.\r\n\'Number 13 A is safe, sir, in the occupation of a stranger. I am the\r\nservant of the Company; and I dare not turn money out of the hotel.\'\r\n\r\nHearing this, Francis said good-bye--and said nothing more. He was\r\nashamed to acknowledge it to himself, but he felt an irresistible\r\ncuriosity to know what would happen when Agnes arrived at the hotel.\r\nBesides, \'Mrs. James\' had reposed a confidence in him. He got into his\r\ngondola, respecting the confidence of \'Mrs. James.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards evening on the third day, Lord Montbarry and his travelling\r\ncompanions arrived, punctual to their appointment.\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. James,\' sitting at the window of her room watching for them, saw\r\nthe new Lord land from the gondola first. He handed his wife to the\r\nsteps. The three children were next committed to his care. Last of\r\nall, Agnes appeared in the little black doorway of the gondola cabin,\r\nand, taking Lord Montbarry\'s hand, passed in her turn to the steps.\r\nShe wore no veil. As she ascended to the door of the hotel, the\r\nCountess (eyeing her through an opera-glass) noticed that she paused to\r\nlook at the outside of the building, and that her face was very pale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Montbarry were received by the housekeeper; the manager\r\nbeing absent for a day or two on business connected with the affairs of\r\nthe hotel.\r\n\r\nThe rooms reserved for the travellers on the first floor were three in\r\nnumber; consisting of two bedrooms opening into each other, and\r\ncommunicating on the left with a drawing-room. Complete so far, the\r\narrangements proved to be less satisfactory in reference to the third\r\nbedroom required for Agnes and for the eldest daughter of Lord\r\nMontbarry, who usually slept with her on their travels. The\r\nbed-chamber on the right of the drawing-room was already occupied by an\r\nEnglish widow lady. Other bedchambers at the other end of the corridor\r\nwere also let in every case. There was accordingly no alternative but\r\nto place at the disposal of Agnes a comfortable room on the second\r\nfloor. Lady Montbarry vainly complained of this separation of one of\r\nthe members of her travelling party from the rest. The housekeeper\r\npolitely hinted that it was impossible for her to ask other travellers\r\nto give up their rooms. She could only express her regret, and assure\r\nMiss Lockwood that her bed-chamber on the second floor was one of the\r\nbest rooms in that part of the hotel.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of the housekeeper, Lady Montbarry noticed that Agnes\r\nhad seated herself apart, feeling apparently no interest in the\r\nquestion of the bedrooms. Was she ill? No; she felt a little unnerved\r\nby the railway journey, and that was all. Hearing this, Lord Montbarry\r\nproposed that she should go out with him, and try the experiment of\r\nhalf an hour\'s walk in the cool evening air. Agnes gladly accepted the\r\nsuggestion. They directed their steps towards the square of St. Mark,\r\nso as to enjoy the breeze blowing over the lagoon. It was the first\r\nvisit of Agnes to Venice. The fascination of the wonderful city of the\r\nwaters exerted its full influence over her sensitive nature. The\r\nproposed half-hour of the walk had passed away, and was fast expanding\r\nto half an hour more, before Lord Montbarry could persuade his\r\ncompanion to remember that dinner was waiting for them. As they\r\nreturned, passing under the colonnade, neither of them noticed a lady\r\nin deep mourning, loitering in the open space of the square. She\r\nstarted as she recognised Agnes walking with the new Lord\r\nMontbarry--hesitated for a moment--and then followed them, at a\r\ndiscreet distance, back to the hotel.\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry received Agnes in high spirits--with news of an event\r\nwhich had happened in her absence.\r\n\r\nShe had not left the hotel more than ten minutes, before a little note\r\nin pencil was brought to Lady Montbarry by the housekeeper. The writer\r\nproved to be no less a person than the widow lady who occupied the room\r\non the other side of the drawing-room, which her ladyship had vainly\r\nhoped to secure for Agnes. Writing under the name of Mrs. James, the\r\npolite widow explained that she had heard from the housekeeper of the\r\ndisappointment experienced by Lady Montbarry in the matter of the\r\nrooms. Mrs. James was quite alone; and as long as her bed-chamber was\r\nairy and comfortable, it mattered nothing to her whether she slept on\r\nthe first or the second floor of the house. She had accordingly much\r\npleasure in proposing to change rooms with Miss Lockwood. Her luggage\r\nhad already been removed, and Miss Lockwood had only to take possession\r\nof the room (Number 13 A), which was now entirely at her disposal.\r\n\r\n\'I immediately proposed to see Mrs. James,\' Lady Montbarry continued,\r\n\'and to thank her personally for her extreme kindness. But I was\r\ninformed that she had gone out, without leaving word at what hour she\r\nmight be expected to return. I have written a little note of thanks,\r\nsaying that we hope to have the pleasure of personally expressing our\r\nsense of Mrs. James\'s courtesy to-morrow. In the mean time, Agnes, I\r\nhave ordered your boxes to be removed downstairs. Go!--and judge for\r\nyourself, my dear, if that good lady has not given up to you the\r\nprettiest room in the house!\'\r\n\r\nWith those words, Lady Montbarry left Miss Lockwood to make a hasty\r\ntoilet for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe new room at once produced a favourable impression on Agnes. The\r\nlarge window, opening into a balcony, commanded an admirable view of\r\nthe canal. The decorations on the walls and ceiling were skilfully\r\ncopied from the exquisitely graceful designs of Raphael in the Vatican.\r\nThe massive wardrobe possessed compartments of unusual size, in which\r\ndouble the number of dresses that Agnes possessed might have been\r\nconveniently hung at full length. In the inner corner of the room,\r\nnear the head of the bedstead, there was a recess which had been turned\r\ninto a little dressing-room, and which opened by a second door on the\r\ninterior staircase of the hotel, commonly used by the servants.\r\nNoticing these aspects of the room at a glance, Agnes made the\r\nnecessary change in her dress, as quickly as possible. On her way back\r\nto the drawing-room she was addressed by a chambermaid in the corridor\r\nwho asked for her key. \'I will put your room tidy for the night,\r\nMiss,\' the woman said, \'and I will then bring the key back to you in\r\nthe drawing-room.\'\r\n\r\nWhile the chambermaid was at her work, a solitary lady, loitering about\r\nthe corridor of the second storey, was watching her over the\r\nbannisters. After a while, the maid appeared, with her pail in her\r\nhand, leaving the room by way of the dressing-room and the back stairs.\r\nAs she passed out of sight, the lady on the second floor (no other, it\r\nis needless to add, than the Countess herself) ran swiftly down the\r\nstairs, entered the bed-chamber by the principal door, and hid herself\r\nin the empty side compartment of the wardrobe. The chambermaid\r\nreturned, completed her work, locked the door of the dressing-room on\r\nthe inner side, locked the principal entrance-door on leaving the room,\r\nand returned the key to Agnes in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe travellers were just sitting down to their late dinner, when one of\r\nthe children noticed that Agnes was not wearing her watch. Had she\r\nleft it in her bed-chamber in the hurry of changing her dress? She\r\nrose from the table at once in search of her watch; Lady Montbarry\r\nadvising her, as she went out, to see to the security of her\r\nbed-chamber, in the event of there being thieves in the house. Agnes\r\nfound her watch, forgotten on the toilet table, as she had anticipated.\r\nBefore leaving the room again she acted on Lady Montbarry\'s advice, and\r\ntried the key in the lock of the dressing-room door. It was properly\r\nsecured. She left the bed-chamber, locking the main door behind her.\r\n\r\nImmediately on her departure, the Countess, oppressed by the confined\r\nair in the wardrobe, ventured on stepping out of her hiding place into\r\nthe empty room.\r\n\r\nEntering the dressing-room, she listened at the door, until the silence\r\noutside informed her that the corridor was empty. Upon this, she\r\nunlocked the door, and, passing out, closed it again softly; leaving it\r\nto all appearance (when viewed on the inner side) as carefully secured\r\nas Agnes had seen it when she tried the key in the lock with her own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhile the Montbarrys were still at dinner, Henry Westwick joined them,\r\narriving from Milan.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the room, and again when he advanced to shake hands\r\nwith her, Agnes was conscious of a latent feeling which secretly\r\nreciprocated Henry\'s unconcealed pleasure on meeting her again. For a\r\nmoment only, she returned his look; and in that moment her own\r\nobservation told her that she had silently encouraged him to hope. She\r\nsaw it in the sudden glow of happiness which overspread his face; and\r\nshe confusedly took refuge in the usual conventional inquiries relating\r\nto the relatives whom he had left at Milan.\r\n\r\nTaking his place at the table, Henry gave a most amusing account of the\r\nposition of his brother Francis between the mercenary opera-dancer on\r\none side, and the unscrupulous manager of the French theatre on the\r\nother. Matters had proceeded to such extremities, that the law had\r\nbeen called on to interfere, and had decided the dispute in favour of\r\nFrancis. On winning the victory the English manager had at once left\r\nMilan, recalled to London by the affairs of his theatre. He was\r\naccompanied on the journey back, as he had been accompanied on the\r\njourney out, by his sister. Resolved, after passing two nights of\r\nterror in the Venetian hotel, never to enter it again, Mrs. Norbury\r\nasked to be excused from appearing at the family festival, on the\r\nground of ill-health. At her age, travelling fatigued her, and she was\r\nglad to take advantage of her brother\'s escort to return to England.\r\n\r\nWhile the talk at the dinner-table flowed easily onward, the\r\nevening-time advanced to night--and it became necessary to think of\r\nsending the children to bed.\r\n\r\nAs Agnes rose to leave the room, accompanied by the eldest girl, she\r\nobserved with surprise that Henry\'s manner suddenly changed. He looked\r\nserious and pre-occupied; and when his niece wished him good night, he\r\nabruptly said to her, \'Marian, I want to know what part of the hotel\r\nyou sleep in?\' Marian, puzzled by the question, answered that she was\r\ngoing to sleep, as usual, with \'Aunt Agnes.\' Not satisfied with that\r\nreply, Henry next inquired whether the bedroom was near the rooms\r\noccupied by the other members of the travelling party. Answering for\r\nthe child, and wondering what Henry\'s object could possibly be, Agnes\r\nmentioned the polite sacrifice made to her convenience by Mrs. James.\r\n\'Thanks to that lady\'s kindness,\' she said, \'Marian and I are only on\r\nthe other side of the drawing-room.\' Henry made no remark; he looked\r\nincomprehensibly discontented as he opened the door for Agnes and her\r\ncompanion to pass out. After wishing them good night, he waited in the\r\ncorridor until he saw them enter the fatal corner-room--and then he\r\ncalled abruptly to his brother, \'Come out, Stephen, and let us smoke!\'\r\n\r\nAs soon as the two brothers were at liberty to speak together\r\nprivately, Henry explained the motive which had led to his strange\r\ninquiries about the bedrooms. Francis had informed him of the meeting\r\nwith the Countess at Venice, and of all that had followed it; and Henry\r\nnow carefully repeated the narrative to his brother in all its details.\r\n\'I am not satisfied,\' he added, \'about that woman\'s purpose in giving\r\nup her room. Without alarming the ladies by telling them what I have\r\njust told you, can you not warn Agnes to be careful in securing her\r\ndoor?\'\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry replied, that the warning had been already given by his\r\nwife, and that Agnes might be trusted to take good care of herself and\r\nher little bed-fellow. For the rest, he looked upon the story of the\r\nCountess and her superstitions as a piece of theatrical exaggeration,\r\namusing enough in itself, but unworthy of a moment\'s serious attention.\r\n\r\nWhile the gentlemen were absent from the hotel, the room which had been\r\nalready associated with so many startling circumstances, became the\r\nscene of another strange event in which Lady Montbarry\'s eldest child\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\nLittle Marian had been got ready for bed as usual, and had (so far)\r\ntaken hardly any notice of the new room. As she knelt down to say her\r\nprayers, she happened to look up at that part of the ceiling above her\r\nwhich was just over the head of the bed. The next instant she alarmed\r\nAgnes, by starting to her feet with a cry of terror, and pointing to a\r\nsmall brown spot on one of the white panelled spaces of the carved\r\nceiling. \'It\'s a spot of blood!\' the child exclaimed. \'Take me away!\r\nI won\'t sleep here!\'\r\n\r\nSeeing plainly that it would be useless to reason with her while she\r\nwas in the room, Agnes hurriedly wrapped Marian in a dressing-gown, and\r\ncarried her back to her mother in the drawing-room. Here, the ladies\r\ndid their best to soothe and reassure the trembling girl. The effort\r\nproved to be useless; the impression that had been produced on the\r\nyoung and sensitive mind was not to be removed by persuasion. Marian\r\ncould give no explanation of the panic of terror that had seized her.\r\nShe was quite unable to say why the spot on the ceiling looked like the\r\ncolour of a spot of blood. She only knew that she should die of terror\r\nif she saw it again. Under these circumstances, but one alternative\r\nwas left. It was arranged that the child should pass the night in the\r\nroom occupied by her two younger sisters and the nurse.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more, Marian was peacefully asleep with her arm around\r\nher sister\'s neck. Lady Montbarry went back with Agnes to her room to\r\nsee the spot on the ceiling which had so strangely frightened the\r\nchild. It was so small as to be only just perceptible, and it had in\r\nall probability been caused by the carelessness of a workman, or by a\r\ndripping from water accidentally spilt on the floor of the room above.\r\n\r\n\'I really cannot understand why Marian should place such a shocking\r\ninterpretation on such a trifling thing,\' Lady Montbarry remarked.\r\n\r\n\'I suspect the nurse is in some way answerable for what has happened,\'\r\nAgnes suggested. \'She may quite possibly have been telling Marian some\r\ntragic nursery story which has left its mischievous impression behind\r\nit. Persons in her position are sadly ignorant of the danger of\r\nexciting a child\'s imagination. You had better caution the nurse\r\nto-morrow.\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry looked round the room with admiration. \'Is it not\r\nprettily decorated?\' she said. \'I suppose, Agnes, you don\'t mind\r\nsleeping here by yourself.?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes laughed. \'I feel so tired,\' she replied, \'that I was thinking of\r\nbidding you good-night, instead of going back to the drawing-room.\'\r\n\r\nLady Montbarry turned towards the door. \'I see your jewel-case on the\r\ntable,\' she resumed. \'Don\'t forget to lock the other door there, in\r\nthe dressing-room.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have already seen to it, and tried the key myself,\' said Agnes.\r\n\'Can I be of any use to you before I go to bed?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, my dear, thank you; I feel sleepy enough to follow your example.\r\nGood night, Agnes--and pleasant dreams on your first night in Venice.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving closed and secured the door on Lady Montbarry\'s departure, Agnes\r\nput on her dressing-gown, and, turning to her open boxes, began the\r\nbusiness of unpacking. In the hurry of making her toilet for dinner,\r\nshe had taken the first dress that lay uppermost in the trunk, and had\r\nthrown her travelling costume on the bed. She now opened the doors of\r\nthe wardrobe for the first time, and began to hang her dresses on the\r\nhooks in the large compartment on one side.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes only of this occupation, she grew weary of it, and\r\ndecided on leaving the trunks as they were, until the next morning.\r\nThe oppressive south wind, which had blown throughout the day, still\r\nprevailed at night. The atmosphere of the room felt close; Agnes threw\r\na shawl over her head and shoulders, and, opening the window, stepped\r\ninto the balcony to look at the view.\r\n\r\nThe night was heavy and overcast: nothing could be distinctly seen.\r\nThe canal beneath the window looked like a black gulf; the opposite\r\nhouses were barely visible as a row of shadows, dimly relieved against\r\nthe starless and moonless sky. At long intervals, the warning cry of a\r\nbelated gondolier was just audible, as he turned the corner of a\r\ndistant canal, and called to invisible boats which might be approaching\r\nhim in the darkness. Now and then, the nearer dip of an oar in the\r\nwater told of the viewless passage of other gondolas bringing guests\r\nback to the hotel. Excepting these rare sounds, the mysterious\r\nnight-silence of Venice was literally the silence of the grave.\r\n\r\nLeaning on the parapet of the balcony, Agnes looked vacantly into the\r\nblack void beneath. Her thoughts reverted to the miserable man who had\r\nbroken his pledged faith to her, and who had died in that house. Some\r\nchange seemed to have come over her since her arrival in Venice; some\r\nnew influence appeared to be at work. For the first time in her\r\nexperience of herself, compassion and regret were not the only emotions\r\naroused in her by the remembrance of the dead Montbarry. A keen sense\r\nof the wrong that she had suffered, never yet felt by that gentle and\r\nforgiving nature, was felt by it now. She found herself thinking of\r\nthe bygone days of her humiliation almost as harshly as Henry Westwick\r\nhad thought of them--she who had rebuked him the last time he had\r\nspoken slightingly of his brother in her presence! A sudden fear and\r\ndoubt of herself, startled her physically as well as morally. She\r\nturned from the shadowy abyss of the dark water as if the mystery and\r\nthe gloom of it had been answerable for the emotions which had taken\r\nher by surprise. Abruptly closing the window, she threw aside her\r\nshawl, and lit the candles on the mantelpiece, impelled by a sudden\r\ncraving for light in the solitude of her room.\r\n\r\nThe cheering brightness round her, contrasting with the black gloom\r\noutside, restored her spirits. She felt herself enjoying the light\r\nlike a child!\r\n\r\nWould it be well (she asked herself) to get ready for bed? No! The\r\nsense of drowsy fatigue that she had felt half an hour since was gone.\r\nShe returned to the dull employment of unpacking her boxes. After a\r\nfew minutes only, the occupation became irksome to her once more. She\r\nsat down by the table, and took up a guide-book. \'Suppose I inform\r\nmyself,\' she thought, \'on the subject of Venice?\'\r\n\r\nHer attention wandered from the book, before she had turned the first\r\npage of it.\r\n\r\nThe image of Henry Westwick was the presiding image in her memory now.\r\nRecalling the minutest incidents and details of the evening, she could\r\nthink of nothing which presented him under other than a favourable and\r\ninteresting aspect. She smiled to herself softly, her colour rose by\r\nfine gradations, as she felt the full luxury of dwelling on the perfect\r\ntruth and modesty of his devotion to her. Was the depression of\r\nspirits from which she had suffered so persistently on her travels\r\nattributable, by any chance, to their long separation from each\r\nother--embittered perhaps by her own vain regret when she remembered\r\nher harsh reception of him in Paris? Suddenly conscious of this bold\r\nquestion, and of the self-abandonment which it implied, she returned\r\nmechanically to her book, distrusting the unrestrained liberty of her\r\nown thoughts. What lurking temptations to forbidden tenderness find\r\ntheir hiding-places in a woman\'s dressing-gown, when she is alone in\r\nher room at night! With her heart in the tomb of the dead Montbarry,\r\ncould Agnes even think of another man, and think of love? How\r\nshameful! how unworthy of her! For the second time, she tried to\r\ninterest herself in the guide-book--and once more she tried in vain.\r\nThrowing the book aside, she turned desperately to the one resource\r\nthat was left, to her luggage--resolved to fatigue herself without\r\nmercy, until she was weary enough and sleepy enough to find a safe\r\nrefuge in bed.\r\n\r\nFor some little time, she persisted in the monotonous occupation of\r\ntransferring her clothes from her trunk to the wardrobe. The large\r\nclock in the hall, striking mid-night, reminded her that it was getting\r\nlate. She sat down for a moment in an arm-chair by the bedside, to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the house now caught her attention, and held it--held it\r\ndisagreeably. Was everybody in bed and asleep but herself? Surely it\r\nwas time for her to follow the general example? With a certain\r\nirritable nervous haste, she rose again and undressed herself. \'I have\r\nlost two hours of rest,\' she thought, frowning at the reflection of\r\nherself in the glass, as she arranged her hair for the night. \'I shall\r\nbe good for nothing to-morrow!\'\r\n\r\nShe lit the night-light, and extinguished the candles--with one\r\nexception, which she removed to a little table, placed on the side of\r\nthe bed opposite to the side occupied by the arm-chair. Having put her\r\ntravelling-box of matches and the guide-book near the candle, in case\r\nshe might be sleepless and might want to read, she blew out the light,\r\nand laid her head on the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe curtains of the bed were looped back to let the air pass freely\r\nover her. Lying on her left side, with her face turned away from the\r\ntable, she could see the arm-chair by the dim night-light. It had a\r\nchintz covering--representing large bunches of roses scattered over a\r\npale green ground. She tried to weary herself into drowsiness by\r\ncounting over and over again the bunches of roses that were visible\r\nfrom her point of view. Twice her attention was distracted from the\r\ncounting, by sounds outside--by the clock chiming the half-hour past\r\ntwelve; and then again, by the fall of a pair of boots on the upper\r\nfloor, thrown out to be cleaned, with that barbarous disregard of the\r\ncomfort of others which is observable in humanity when it inhabits an\r\nhotel. In the silence that followed these passing disturbances, Agnes\r\nwent on counting the roses on the arm-chair, more and more slowly.\r\nBefore long, she confused herself in the figures--tried to begin\r\ncounting again--thought she would wait a little first--felt her eyelids\r\ndrooping, and her head reclining lower and lower on the pillow--sighed\r\nfaintly--and sank into sleep.\r\n\r\nHow long that first sleep lasted, she never knew. She could only\r\nremember, in the after-time, that she woke instantly.\r\n\r\nEvery faculty and perception in her passed the boundary line between\r\ninsensibility and consciousness, so to speak, at a leap. Without\r\nknowing why, she sat up suddenly in the bed, listening for she knew not\r\nwhat. Her head was in a whirl; her heart beat furiously, without any\r\nassignable cause. But one trivial event had happened during the\r\ninterval while she had been asleep. The night-light had gone out; and\r\nthe room, as a matter of course, was in total darkness.\r\n\r\nShe felt for the match-box, and paused after finding it. A vague sense\r\nof confusion was still in her mind. She was in no hurry to light the\r\nmatch. The pause in the darkness was, for the moment, agreeable to her.\r\n\r\nIn the quieter flow of her thoughts during this interval, she could ask\r\nherself the natural question:--What cause had awakened her so suddenly,\r\nand had so strangely shaken her nerves? Had it been the influence of a\r\ndream? She had not dreamed at all--or, to speak more correctly, she\r\nhad no waking remembrance of having dreamed. The mystery was beyond\r\nher fathoming: the darkness began to oppress her. She struck the match\r\non the box, and lit her candle.\r\n\r\nAs the welcome light diffused itself over the room, she turned from the\r\ntable and looked towards the other side of the bed.\r\n\r\nIn the moment when she turned, the chill of a sudden terror gripped her\r\nround the heart, as with the clasp of an icy hand.\r\n\r\nShe was not alone in her room!\r\n\r\nThere--in the chair at the bedside--there, suddenly revealed under the\r\nflow of light from the candle, was the figure of a woman, reclining.\r\nHer head lay back over the chair. Her face, turned up to the ceiling,\r\nhad the eyes closed, as if she was wrapped in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the discovery held Agnes speechless and helpless. Her\r\nfirst conscious action, when she was in some degree mistress of herself\r\nagain, was to lean over the bed, and to look closer at the woman who\r\nhad so incomprehensibly stolen into her room in the dead of night. One\r\nglance was enough: she started back with a cry of amazement. The\r\nperson in the chair was no other than the widow of the dead\r\nMontbarry--the woman who had warned her that they were to meet again,\r\nand that the place might be Venice!\r\n\r\nHer courage returned to her, stung into action by the natural sense of\r\nindignation which the presence of the Countess provoked.\r\n\r\n\'Wake up!\' she called out. \'How dare you come here? How did you get\r\nin? Leave the room--or I will call for help!\'\r\n\r\nShe raised her voice at the last words. It produced no effect.\r\nLeaning farther over the bed, she boldly took the Countess by the\r\nshoulder and shook her. Not even this effort succeeded in rousing the\r\nsleeping woman. She still lay back in the chair, possessed by a torpor\r\nlike the torpor of death--insensible to sound, insensible to touch.\r\nWas she really sleeping? Or had she fainted?\r\n\r\nAgnes looked closer at her. She had not fainted. Her breathing was\r\naudible, rising and falling in deep heavy gasps. At intervals she\r\nground her teeth savagely. Beads of perspiration stood thickly on her\r\nforehead. Her clenched hands rose and fell slowly from time to time on\r\nher lap. Was she in the agony of a dream? or was she spiritually\r\nconscious of something hidden in the room?\r\n\r\nThe doubt involved in that last question was unendurable. Agnes\r\ndetermined to rouse the servants who kept watch in the hotel at night.\r\n\r\nThe bell-handle was fixed to the wall, on the side of the bed by which\r\nthe table stood.\r\n\r\nShe raised herself from the crouching position which she had assumed in\r\nlooking close at the Countess; and, turning towards the other side of\r\nthe bed, stretched out her hand to the bell. At the same instant, she\r\nstopped and looked upward. Her hand fell helplessly at her side. She\r\nshuddered, and sank back on the pillow.\r\n\r\nWhat had she seen?\r\n\r\nShe had seen another intruder in her room.\r\n\r\nMidway between her face and the ceiling, there hovered a human\r\nhead--severed at the neck, like a head struck from the body by the\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\nNothing visible, nothing audible, had given her any intelligible\r\nwarning of its appearance. Silently and suddenly, the head had taken\r\nits place above her. No supernatural change had passed over the room,\r\nor was perceptible in it now. The dumbly-tortured figure in the chair;\r\nthe broad window opposite the foot of the bed, with the black night\r\nbeyond it; the candle burning on the table--these, and all other\r\nobjects in the room, remained unaltered. One object more, unutterably\r\nhorrid, had been added to the rest. That was the only change--no more,\r\nno less.\r\n\r\nBy the yellow candlelight she saw the head distinctly, hovering in\r\nmid-air above her. She looked at it steadfastly, spell-bound by the\r\nterror that held her.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the face was gone. The shrivelled skin was darkened in\r\nhue, like the skin of an Egyptian mummy--except at the neck. There it\r\nwas of a lighter colour; there it showed spots and splashes of the hue\r\nof that brown spot on the ceiling, which the child\'s fanciful terror\r\nhad distorted into the likeness of a spot of blood. Thin remains of a\r\ndiscoloured moustache and whiskers, hanging over the upper lip, and\r\nover the hollows where the cheeks had once been, made the head just\r\nrecognisable as the head of a man. Over all the features death and\r\ntime had done their obliterating work. The eyelids were closed. The\r\nhair on the skull, discoloured like the hair on the face, had been\r\nburnt away in places. The bluish lips, parted in a fixed grin, showed\r\nthe double row of teeth. By slow degrees, the hovering head (perfectly\r\nstill when she first saw it) began to descend towards Agnes as she lay\r\nbeneath. By slow degrees, that strange doubly-blended odour, which the\r\nCommissioners had discovered in the vaults of the old palace--which had\r\nsickened Francis Westwick in the bed-chamber of the new hotel--spread\r\nits fetid exhalations over the room. Downward and downward the hideous\r\napparition made its slow progress, until it stopped close over\r\nAgnes--stopped, and turned slowly, so that the face of it confronted\r\nthe upturned face of the woman in the chair.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then, a supernatural movement disturbed the rigid\r\nrepose of the dead face.\r\n\r\nThe closed eyelids opened slowly. The eyes revealed themselves, bright\r\nwith the glassy film of death--and fixed their dreadful look on the\r\nwoman in the chair.\r\n\r\nAgnes saw that look; saw the eyelids of the living woman open slowly\r\nlike the eyelids of the dead; saw her rise, as if in obedience to some\r\nsilent command--and saw no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer next conscious impression was of the sunlight pouring in at the\r\nwindow; of the friendly presence of Lady Montbarry at the bedside; and\r\nof the children\'s wondering faces peeping in at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\'...You have some influence over Agnes. Try what you can do, Henry, to\r\nmake her take a sensible view of the matter. There is really nothing\r\nto make a fuss about. My wife\'s maid knocked at her door early in the\r\nmorning, with the customary cup of tea. Getting no answer, she went\r\nround to the dressing-room--found the door on that side unlocked--and\r\ndiscovered Agnes on the bed in a fainting fit. With my wife\'s help,\r\nthey brought her to herself again; and she told the extraordinary story\r\nwhich I have just repeated to you. You must have seen for yourself\r\nthat she has been over-fatigued, poor thing, by our long railway\r\njourneys: her nerves are out of order--and she is just the person to\r\nbe easily terrified by a dream. She obstinately refuses, however, to\r\naccept this rational view. Don\'t suppose that I have been severe with\r\nher! All that a man can do to humour her I have done. I have written\r\nto the Countess (in her assumed name) offering to restore the room to\r\nher. She writes back, positively declining to return to it. I have\r\naccordingly arranged (so as not to have the thing known in the hotel)\r\nto occupy the room for one or two nights, and to leave Agnes to recover\r\nher spirits under my wife\'s care. Is there anything more that I can\r\ndo? Whatever questions Agnes has asked of me I have answered to the\r\nbest of my ability; she knows all that you told me about Francis and\r\nthe Countess last night. But try as I may I can\'t quiet her mind. I\r\nhave given up the attempt in despair, and left her in the drawing-room.\r\nGo, like a good fellow, and try what you can do to compose her.\'\r\n\r\nIn those words, Lord Montbarry stated the case to his brother from the\r\nrational point of view. Henry made no remark, he went straight to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nHe found Agnes walking rapidly backwards and forwards, flushed and\r\nexcited. \'If you come here to say what your brother has been saying to\r\nme,\' she broke out, before he could speak, \'spare yourself the trouble.\r\nI don\'t want common sense--I want a true friend who will believe in me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am that friend, Agnes,\' Henry answered quietly, \'and you know it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You really believe that I am not deluded by a dream?\'\r\n\r\nI know that you are not deluded--in one particular, at least.\'\r\n\r\n\'In what particular?\'\r\n\r\n\'In what you have said of the Countess. It is perfectly true--\'\r\n\r\nAgnes stopped him there. \'Why do I only hear this morning that the\r\nCountess and Mrs. James are one and the same person?\' she asked\r\ndistrustfully. \'Why was I not told of it last night?\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget that you had accepted the exchange of rooms before I\r\nreached Venice,\' Henry replied. \'I felt strongly tempted to tell you,\r\neven then--but your sleeping arrangements for the night were all made;\r\nI should only have inconvenienced and alarmed you. I waited till the\r\nmorning, after hearing from my brother that you had yourself seen to\r\nyour security from any intrusion. How that intrusion was accomplished\r\nit is impossible to say. I can only declare that the Countess\'s\r\npresence by your bedside last night was no dream of yours. On her own\r\nauthority I can testify that it was a reality.\'\r\n\r\n\'On her own authority?\' Agnes repeated eagerly. \'Have you seen her\r\nthis morning?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have seen her not ten minutes since.\'\r\n\r\n\'What was she doing?\'\r\n\r\n\'She was busily engaged in writing. I could not even get her to look at\r\nme until I thought of mentioning your name.\'\r\n\r\n\'She remembered me, of course?\'\r\n\r\n\'She remembered you with some difficulty. Finding that she wouldn\'t\r\nanswer me on any other terms, I questioned her as if I had come direct\r\nfrom you. Then she spoke. She not only admitted that she had the same\r\nsuperstitious motive for placing you in that room which she had\r\nacknowledged to Francis--she even owned that she had been by your\r\nbedside, watching through the night, "to see what you saw," as she\r\nexpressed it. Hearing this, I tried to persuade her to tell me how she\r\ngot into the room. Unluckily, her manuscript on the table caught her\r\neye; she returned to her writing. "The Baron wants money," she said;\r\n"I must get on with my play." What she saw or dreamed while she was in\r\nyour room last night, it is at present impossible to discover. But\r\njudging by my brother\'s account of her, as well as by what I remember\r\nof her myself, some recent influence has been at work which has\r\nproduced a marked change in this wretched woman for the worse. Her\r\nmind (since last night, perhaps) is partially deranged. One proof of\r\nit is that she spoke to me of the Baron as if he were still a living\r\nman. When Francis saw her, she declared that the Baron was dead, which\r\nis the truth. The United States Consul at Milan showed us the\r\nannouncement of the death in an American newspaper. So far as I can\r\nsee, such sense as she still possesses seems to be entirely absorbed in\r\none absurd idea--the idea of writing a play for Francis to bring out at\r\nhis theatre. He admits that he encouraged her to hope she might get\r\nmoney in this way. I think he did wrong. Don\'t you agree with me?\'\r\n\r\nWithout heeding the question, Agnes rose abruptly from her chair.\r\n\r\n\'Do me one more kindness, Henry,\' she said. \'Take me to the Countess\r\nat once.\'\r\n\r\nHenry hesitated. \'Are you composed enough to see her, after the shock\r\nthat you have suffered?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nShe trembled, the flush on her face died away, and left it deadly pale.\r\nBut she held to her resolution. \'You have heard of what I saw last\r\nnight?\' she said faintly.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t speak of it!\' Henry interposed. \'Don\'t uselessly agitate\r\nyourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must speak! My mind is full of horrid questions about it. I know I\r\ncan\'t identify it--and yet I ask myself over and over again, in whose\r\nlikeness did it appear? Was it in the likeness of Ferrari? or was\r\nit--?\' she stopped, shuddering. \'The Countess knows, I must see the\r\nCountess!\' she resumed vehemently. \'Whether my courage fails me or\r\nnot, I must make the attempt. Take me to her before I have time to\r\nfeel afraid of it!\'\r\n\r\nHenry looked at her anxiously. \'If you are really sure of your own\r\nresolution,\' he said, \'I agree with you--the sooner you see her the\r\nbetter. You remember how strangely she talked of your influence over\r\nher, when she forced her way into your room in London?\'\r\n\r\n\'I remember it perfectly. Why do you ask?\'\r\n\r\n\'For this reason. In the present state of her mind, I doubt if she\r\nwill be much longer capable of realizing her wild idea of you as the\r\navenging angel who is to bring her to a reckoning for her evil deeds.\r\nIt may be well to try what your influence can do while she is still\r\ncapable of feeling it.\'\r\n\r\nHe waited to hear what Agnes would say. She took his arm and led him\r\nin silence to the door.\r\n\r\nThey ascended to the second floor, and, after knocking, entered the\r\nCountess\'s room.\r\n\r\nShe was still busily engaged in writing. When she looked up from the\r\npaper, and saw Agnes, a vacant expression of doubt was the only\r\nexpression in her wild black eyes. After a few moments, the lost\r\nremembrances and associations appeared to return slowly to her mind.\r\nThe pen dropped from her hand. Haggard and trembling, she looked\r\ncloser at Agnes, and recognised her at last. \'Has the time come\r\nalready?\' she said in low awe-struck tones. \'Give me a little longer\r\nrespite, I haven\'t done my writing yet!\'\r\n\r\nShe dropped on her knees, and held out her clasped hands entreatingly.\r\nAgnes was far from having recovered, after the shock that she had\r\nsuffered in the night: her nerves were far from being equal to the\r\nstrain that was now laid on them. She was so startled by the change in\r\nthe Countess, that she was at a loss what to say or to do next. Henry\r\nwas obliged to speak to her. \'Put your questions while you have the\r\nchance,\' he said, lowering his voice. \'See! the vacant look is coming\r\nover her face again.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes tried to rally her courage. \'You were in my room last night--\'\r\nshe began. Before she could add a word more, the Countess lifted her\r\nhands, and wrung them above her head with a low moan of horror. Agnes\r\nshrank back, and turned as if to leave the room. Henry stopped her,\r\nand whispered to her to try again. She obeyed him after an effort. \'I\r\nslept last night in the room that you gave up to me,\' she resumed. \'I\r\nsaw--\'\r\n\r\nThe Countess suddenly rose to her feet. \'No more of that,\' she cried.\r\n\'Oh, Jesu Maria! do you think I want to be told what you saw? Do you\r\nthink I don\'t know what it means for you and for me? Decide for\r\nyourself, Miss. Examine your own mind. Are you well assured that the\r\nday of reckoning has come at last? Are you ready to follow me back,\r\nthrough the crimes of the past, to the secrets of the dead?\'\r\n\r\nShe returned again to the writing-table, without waiting to be\r\nanswered. Her eyes flashed; she looked like her old self once more as\r\nshe spoke. It was only for a moment. The old ardour and impetuosity\r\nwere nearly worn out. Her head sank; she sighed heavily as she\r\nunlocked a desk which stood on the table. Opening a drawer in the\r\ndesk, she took out a leaf of vellum, covered with faded writing. Some\r\nragged ends of silken thread were still attached to the leaf, as if it\r\nhad been torn out of a book.\r\n\r\n\'Can you read Italian?\' she asked, handing the leaf to Agnes.\r\n\r\nAgnes answered silently by an inclination of her head.\r\n\r\n\'The leaf,\' the Countess proceeded, \'once belonged to a book in the old\r\nlibrary of the palace, while this building was still a palace. By whom\r\nit was torn out you have no need to know. For what purpose it was torn\r\nout you may discover for yourself, if you will. Read it first--at the\r\nfifth line from the top of the page.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes felt the serious necessity of composing herself. \'Give me a\r\nchair,\' she said to Henry; \'and I will do my best.\' He placed himself\r\nbehind her chair so that he could look over her shoulder and help her\r\nto understand the writing on the leaf. Rendered into English, it ran\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nI have now completed my literary survey of the first\r\nfloor of the palace. At the desire of my noble and gracious patron,\r\nthe lord of this glorious edifice, I next ascend to the second floor,\r\nand continue my catalogue or description of the pictures, decorations,\r\nand other treasures of art therein contained. Let me begin with the\r\ncorner room at the western extremity of the palace, called the Room of\r\nthe Caryatides, from the statues which support the mantel-piece. This\r\nwork is of comparatively recent execution: it dates from the eighteenth\r\ncentury only, and reveals the corrupt taste of the period in every part\r\nof it. Still, there is a certain interest which attaches to the\r\nmantel-piece: it conceals a cleverly constructed hiding-place, between\r\nthe floor of the room and the ceiling of the room beneath, which was\r\nmade during the last evil days of the Inquisition in Venice, and which\r\nis reported to have saved an ancestor of my gracious lord pursued by\r\nthat terrible tribunal. The machinery of this curious place of\r\nconcealment has been kept in good order by the present lord, as a\r\nspecies of curiosity. He condescended to show me the method of working\r\nit. Approaching the two Caryatides, rest your hand on the forehead\r\n(midway between the eyebrows) of the figure which is on your left as\r\nyou stand opposite to the fireplace, then press the head inwards as if\r\nyou were pushing it against the wall behind. By doing this, you set in\r\nmotion the hidden machinery in the wall which turns the hearthstone on\r\na pivot, and discloses the hollow place below. There is room enough in\r\nit for a man to lie easily at full length. The method of closing the\r\ncavity again is equally simple. Place both your hands on the temples\r\nof the figures; pull as if you were pulling it towards you--and the\r\nhearthstone will revolve into its proper position again.\r\n\r\n\'You need read no farther,\' said the Countess. \'Be careful to remember\r\nwhat you have read.\'\r\n\r\nShe put back the page of vellum in her writing-desk, locked it, and led\r\nthe way to the door.\r\n\r\n\'Come!\' she said; \'and see what the mocking Frenchman called "The\r\nbeginning of the end."\'\r\n\r\nAgnes was barely able to rise from her chair; she trembled from head to\r\nfoot. Henry gave her his arm to support her. \'Fear nothing,\' he\r\nwhispered; \'I shall be with you.\'\r\n\r\nThe Countess proceeded along the westward corridor, and stopped at the\r\ndoor numbered Thirty-eight. This was the room which had been inhabited\r\nby Baron Rivar in the old days of the palace: it was situated\r\nimmediately over the bedchamber in which Agnes had passed the night.\r\nFor the last two days the room had been empty. The absence of luggage\r\nin it, when they opened the door, showed that it had not yet been let.\r\n\r\n\'You see?\' said the Countess, pointing to the carved figure at the\r\nfire-place; \'and you know what to do. Have I deserved that you should\r\ntemper justice with mercy?\' she went on in lower tones. \'Give me a few\r\nhours more to myself. The Baron wants money--I must get on with my\r\nplay.\'\r\n\r\nShe smiled vacantly, and imitated the action of writing with her right\r\nhand as she pronounced the last words. The effort of concentrating her\r\nweakened mind on other and less familiar topics than the constant want\r\nof money in the Baron\'s lifetime, and the vague prospect of gain from\r\nthe still unfinished play, had evidently exhausted her poor reserves of\r\nstrength. When her request had been granted, she addressed no\r\nexpressions of gratitude to Agnes; she only said, \'Feel no fear, miss,\r\nof my attempting to escape you. Where you are, there I must be till\r\nthe end comes.\'\r\n\r\nHer eyes wandered round the room with a last weary and stupefied look.\r\nShe returned to her writing with slow and feeble steps, like the steps\r\nof an old woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry and Agnes were left alone in the Room of the Caryatides.\r\n\r\nThe person who had written the description of the palace--probably a\r\npoor author or artist--had correctly pointed out the defects of the\r\nmantel-piece. Bad taste, exhibiting itself on the most costly and\r\nsplendid scale, was visible in every part of the work. It was\r\nnevertheless greatly admired by ignorant travellers of all classes;\r\npartly on account of its imposing size, and partly on account of the\r\nnumber of variously-coloured marbles which the sculptor had contrived\r\nto introduce into his design. Photographs of the mantel-piece were\r\nexhibited in the public rooms, and found a ready sale among English and\r\nAmerican visitors to the hotel.\r\n\r\nHenry led Agnes to the figure on the left, as they stood facing the\r\nempty fire-place. \'Shall I try the experiment,\' he asked, \'or will\r\nyou?\' She abruptly drew her arm away from him, and turned back to the\r\ndoor. \'I can\'t even look at it,\' she said. \'That merciless marble\r\nface frightens me!\'\r\n\r\nHenry put his hand on the forehead of the figure. \'What is there to\r\nalarm you, my dear, in this conventionally classical face?\' he asked\r\njestingly. Before he could press the head inwards, Agnes hurriedly\r\nopened the door. \'Wait till I am out of the room!\' she cried. \'The\r\nbare idea of what you may find there horrifies me!\' She looked back\r\ninto the room as she crossed the threshold. \'I won\'t leave you\r\naltogether,\' she said, \'I will wait outside.\'\r\n\r\nShe closed the door. Left by himself, Henry lifted his hand once more\r\nto the marble forehead of the figure.\r\n\r\nFor the second time, he was checked on the point of setting the\r\nmachinery of the hiding-place in motion. On this occasion, the\r\ninterruption came from an outbreak of friendly voices in the corridor.\r\nA woman\'s voice exclaimed, \'Dearest Agnes, how glad I am to see you\r\nagain!\' A man\'s voice followed, offering to introduce some friend to\r\n\'Miss Lockwood.\' A third voice (which Henry recognised as the voice of\r\nthe manager of the hotel) became audible next, directing the\r\nhousekeeper to show the ladies and gentlemen the vacant apartments at\r\nthe other end of the corridor. \'If more accommodation is wanted,\' the\r\nmanager went on, \'I have a charming room to let here.\' He opened the\r\ndoor as he spoke, and found himself face to face with Henry Westwick.\r\n\r\n\'This is indeed an agreeable surprise, sir!\' said the manager\r\ncheerfully. \'You are admiring our famous chimney-piece, I see. May I\r\nask, Mr. Westwick, how you find yourself in the hotel, this time? Have\r\nthe supernatural influences affected your appetite again?\'\r\n\r\n\'The supernatural influences have spared me, this time,\' Henry\r\nanswered. \'Perhaps you may yet find that they have affected some other\r\nmember of the family.\' He spoke gravely, resenting the familiar tone\r\nin which the manager had referred to his previous visit to the hotel.\r\n\'Have you just returned?\' he asked, by way of changing the topic.\r\n\r\n\'Just this minute, sir. I had the honour of travelling in the same\r\ntrain with friends of yours who have arrived at the hotel--Mr. and Mrs.\r\nArthur Barville, and their travelling companions. Miss Lockwood is\r\nwith them, looking at the rooms. They will be here before long, if\r\nthey find it convenient to have an extra room at their disposal.\'\r\n\r\nThis announcement decided Henry on exploring the hiding-place, before\r\nthe interruption occurred. It had crossed his mind, when Agnes left\r\nhim, that he ought perhaps to have a witness, in the not very probable\r\nevent of some alarming discovery taking place. The too-familiar\r\nmanager, suspecting nothing, was there at his disposal. He turned\r\nagain to the Caryan figure, maliciously resolving to make the manager\r\nhis witness.\r\n\r\n\'I am delighted to hear that our friends have arrived at last,\' he\r\nsaid. \'Before I shake hands with them, let me ask you a question about\r\nthis queer work of art here. I see photographs of it downstairs. Are\r\nthey for sale?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, Mr. Westwick!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think the chimney-piece is as solid as it looks?\' Henry\r\nproceeded. \'When you came in, I was just wondering whether this figure\r\nhere had not accidentally got loosened from the wall behind it.\' He\r\nlaid his hand on the marble forehead, for the third time. \'To my eye,\r\nit looks a little out of the perpendicular. I almost fancied I could\r\njog the head just now, when I touched it.\' He pressed the head inwards\r\nas he said those words.\r\n\r\nA sound of jarring iron was instantly audible behind the wall. The\r\nsolid hearthstone in front of the fire-place turned slowly at the feet\r\nof the two men, and disclosed a dark cavity below. At the same moment,\r\nthe strange and sickening combination of odours, hitherto associated\r\nwith the vaults of the old palace and with the bed-chamber beneath, now\r\nfloated up from the open recess, and filled the room.\r\n\r\nThe manager started back. \'Good God, Mr. Westwick!\' he exclaimed,\r\n\'what does this mean?\'\r\n\r\nRemembering, not only what his brother Francis had felt in the room\r\nbeneath, but what the experience of Agnes had been on the previous\r\nnight, Henry was determined to be on his guard. \'I am as much\r\nsurprised as you are,\' was his only reply.\r\n\r\n\'Wait for me one moment, sir,\' said the manager. \'I must stop the\r\nladies and gentlemen outside from coming in.\'\r\n\r\nHe hurried away--not forgetting to close the door after him. Henry\r\nopened the window, and waited there breathing the purer air. Vague\r\napprehensions of the next discovery to come, filled his mind for the\r\nfirst time. He was doubly resolved, now, not to stir a step in the\r\ninvestigation without a witness.\r\n\r\nThe manager returned with a wax taper in his hand, which he lighted as\r\nsoon as he entered the room.\r\n\r\n\'We need fear no interruption now,\' he said. \'Be so kind, Mr.\r\nWestwick, as to hold the light. It is my business to find out what\r\nthis extraordinary discovery means.\'\r\n\r\nHenry held the taper. Looking into the cavity, by the dim and\r\nflickering light, they both detected a dark object at the bottom of it.\r\n\'I think I can reach the thing,\' the manager remarked, \'if I lie down,\r\nand put my hand into the hole.\'\r\n\r\nHe knelt on the floor--and hesitated. \'Might I ask you, sir, to give\r\nme my gloves?\' he said. \'They are in my hat, on the chair behind you.\'\r\n\r\nHenry gave him the gloves. \'I don\'t know what I may be going to take\r\nhold of,\' the manager explained, smiling rather uneasily as he put on\r\nhis right glove.\r\n\r\nHe stretched himself at full length on the floor, and passed his right\r\narm into the cavity. \'I can\'t say exactly what I have got hold of,\' he\r\nsaid. \'But I have got it.\'\r\n\r\nHalf raising himself, he drew his hand out.\r\n\r\nThe next instant, he started to his feet with a shriek of terror. A\r\nhuman head dropped from his nerveless grasp on the floor, and rolled to\r\nHenry\'s feet. It was the hideous head that Agnes had seen hovering\r\nabove her, in the vision of the night!\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other, both struck speechless by the same\r\nemotion of horror. The manager was the first to control himself. \'See\r\nto the door, for God\'s sake!\' he said. \'Some of the people outside may\r\nhave heard me.\'\r\n\r\nHenry moved mechanically to the door.\r\n\r\nEven when he had his hand on the key, ready to turn it in the lock in\r\ncase of necessity, he still looked back at the appalling object on the\r\nfloor. There was no possibility of identifying those decayed and\r\ndistorted features with any living creature whom he had seen--and, yet,\r\nhe was conscious of feeling a vague and awful doubt which shook him to\r\nthe soul. The questions which had tortured the mind of Agnes, were now\r\nhis questions too. He asked himself, \'In whose likeness might I have\r\nrecognised it before the decay set in? The likeness of Ferrari? or the\r\nlikeness of--?\' He paused trembling, as Agnes had paused trembling\r\nbefore him. Agnes! The name, of all women\'s names the dearest to him,\r\nwas a terror to him now! What was he to say to her? What might be the\r\nconsequence if he trusted her with the terrible truth?\r\n\r\nNo footsteps approached the door; no voices were audible outside. The\r\ntravellers were still occupied in the rooms at the eastern end of the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\nIn the brief interval that had passed, the manager had sufficiently\r\nrecovered himself to be able to think once more of the first and\r\nforemost interests of his life--the interests of the hotel. He\r\napproached Henry anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'If this frightful discovery becomes known,\' he said, \'the closing of\r\nthe hotel and the ruin of the Company will be the inevitable results.\r\nI feel sure that I can trust your discretion, sir, so far?\'\r\n\r\n\'You can certainly trust me,\' Henry answered. \'But surely discretion\r\nhas its limits,\' he added, \'after such a discovery as we have made?\'\r\n\r\nThe manager understood that the duty which they owed to the community,\r\nas honest and law-abiding men, was the duty to which Henry now\r\nreferred. \'I will at once find the means,\' he said, \'of conveying the\r\nremains privately out of the house, and I will myself place them in the\r\ncare of the police authorities. Will you leave the room with me? or do\r\nyou not object to keep watch here, and help me when I return?\'\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, the voices of the travellers made themselves\r\nheard again at the end of the corridor. Henry instantly consented to\r\nwait in the room. He shrank from facing the inevitable meeting with\r\nAgnes if he showed himself in the corridor at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe manager hastened his departure, in the hope of escaping notice. He\r\nwas discovered by his guests before he could reach the head of the\r\nstairs. Henry heard the voices plainly as he turned the key. While\r\nthe terrible drama of discovery was in progress on one side of the\r\ndoor, trivial questions about the amusements of Venice, and facetious\r\ndiscussions on the relative merits of French and Italian cookery, were\r\nproceeding on the other. Little by little, the sound of the talking\r\ngrew fainter. The visitors, having arranged their plans of amusement\r\nfor the day, were on their way out of the hotel. In a minute or two,\r\nthere was silence once more.\r\n\r\nHenry turned to the window, thinking to relieve his mind by looking at\r\nthe bright view over the canal. He soon grew wearied of the familiar\r\nscene. The morbid fascination which seems to be exercised by all\r\nhorrible sights, drew him back again to the ghastly object on the floor.\r\n\r\nDream or reality, how had Agnes survived the sight of it? As the\r\nquestion passed through his mind, he noticed for the first time\r\nsomething lying on the floor near the head. Looking closer, he\r\nperceived a thin little plate of gold, with three false teeth attached\r\nto it, which had apparently dropped out (loosened by the shock) when\r\nthe manager let the head fall on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this discovery, and the necessity of not too readily\r\ncommunicating it to others, instantly struck Henry. Here surely was a\r\nchance--if any chance remained--of identifying the shocking relic of\r\nhumanity which lay before him, the dumb witness of a crime! Acting on\r\nthis idea, he took possession of the teeth, purposing to use them as a\r\nlast means of inquiry when other attempts at investigation had been\r\ntried and had failed.\r\n\r\nHe went back again to the window: the solitude of the room began to\r\nweigh on his spirits. As he looked out again at the view, there was a\r\nsoft knock at the door. He hastened to open it--and checked himself in\r\nthe act. A doubt occurred to him. Was it the manager who had knocked?\r\nHe called out, \'Who is there?\'\r\n\r\nThe voice of Agnes answered him. \'Have you anything to tell me, Henry?\'\r\n\r\nHe was hardly able to reply. \'Not just now,\' he said, confusedly.\r\n\'Forgive me if I don\'t open the door. I will speak to you a little\r\nlater.\'\r\n\r\nThe sweet voice made itself heard again, pleading with him piteously.\r\n\'Don\'t leave me alone, Henry! I can\'t go back to the happy people\r\ndownstairs.\'\r\n\r\nHow could he resist that appeal? He heard her sigh--he heard the\r\nrustling of her dress as she moved away in despair. The very thing\r\nthat he had shrunk from doing but a few minutes since was the thing\r\nthat he did now! He joined Agnes in the corridor. She turned as she\r\nheard him, and pointed, trembling, in the direction of the closed room.\r\n\'Is it so terrible as that?\' she asked faintly.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her to support her. A thought came to him as he\r\nlooked at her, waiting in doubt and fear for his reply. \'You shall\r\nknow what I have discovered,\' he said, \'if you will first put on your\r\nhat and cloak, and come out with me.\'\r\n\r\nShe was naturally surprised. \'Can you tell me your object in going\r\nout?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nHe owned what his object was unreservedly. \'I want, before all\r\nthings,\' he said, \'to satisfy your mind and mine, on the subject of\r\nMontbarry\'s death. I am going to take you to the doctor who attended\r\nhim in his illness, and to the consul who followed him to the grave.\'\r\n\r\nHer eyes rested on Henry gratefully. \'Oh, how well you understand me!\'\r\nshe said. The manager joined them at the same moment, on his way up\r\nthe stairs. Henry gave him the key of the room, and then called to the\r\nservants in the hall to have a gondola ready at the steps. \'Are you\r\nleaving the hotel?\' the manager asked. \'In search of evidence,\' Henry\r\nwhispered, pointing to the key. \'If the authorities want me, I shall\r\nbe back in an hour.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day had advanced to evening. Lord Montbarry and the bridal party\r\nhad gone to the Opera. Agnes alone, pleading the excuse of fatigue,\r\nremained at the hotel. Having kept up appearances by accompanying his\r\nfriends to the theatre, Henry Westwick slipped away after the first\r\nact, and joined Agnes in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\'Have you thought of what I said to you earlier in the day?\' he asked,\r\ntaking a chair at her side. \'Do you agree with me that the one\r\ndreadful doubt which oppressed us both is at least set at rest?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes shook her head sadly. \'I wish I could agree with you, Henry--I\r\nwish I could honestly say that my mind is at ease.\'\r\n\r\nThe answer would have discouraged most men. Henry\'s patience (where\r\nAgnes was concerned) was equal to any demands on it.\r\n\r\n\'If you will only look back at the events of the day,\' he said, \'you\r\nmust surely admit that we have not been completely baffled. Remember\r\nhow Dr. Bruno disposed of our doubts:--"After thirty years of medical\r\npractice, do you think I am likely to mistake the symptoms of death by\r\nbronchitis?" If ever there was an unanswerable question, there it is!\r\nWas the consul\'s testimony doubtful in any part of it? He called at\r\nthe palace to offer his services, after hearing of Lord Montbarry\'s\r\ndeath; he arrived at the time when the coffin was in the house; he\r\nhimself saw the corpse placed in it, and the lid screwed down. The\r\nevidence of the priest is equally beyond dispute. He remained in the\r\nroom with the coffin, reciting the prayers for the dead, until the\r\nfuneral left the palace. Bear all these statements in mind, Agnes; and\r\nhow can you deny that the question of Montbarry\'s death and burial is a\r\nquestion set at rest? We have really but one doubt left: we have\r\nstill to ask ourselves whether the remains which I discovered are the\r\nremains of the lost courier, or not. There is the case, as I\r\nunderstand it. Have I stated it fairly?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes could not deny that he had stated it fairly.\r\n\r\n"Then what prevents you from experiencing the same sense of relief that\r\nI feel?\' Henry asked.\r\n\r\n\'What I saw last night prevents me,\' Agnes answered. \'When we spoke of\r\nthis subject, after our inquiries were over, you reproached me with\r\ntaking what you called the superstitious view. I don\'t quite admit\r\nthat--but I do acknowledge that I should find the superstitious view\r\nintelligible if I heard it expressed by some other person. Remembering\r\nwhat your brother and I once were to each other in the bygone time, I\r\ncan understand the apparition making itself visible to me, to claim the\r\nmercy of Christian burial, and the vengeance due to a crime. I can\r\neven perceive some faint possibility of truth in the explanation which\r\nyou described as the mesmeric theory--that what I saw might be the\r\nresult of magnetic influence communicated to me, as I lay between the\r\nremains of the murdered husband above me and the guilty wife suffering\r\nthe tortures of remorse at my bedside. But what I do not understand\r\nis, that I should have passed through that dreadful ordeal; having no\r\nprevious knowledge of the murdered man in his lifetime, or only knowing\r\nhim (if you suppose that I saw the apparition of Ferrari) through the\r\ninterest which I took in his wife. I can\'t dispute your reasoning,\r\nHenry. But I feel in my heart of hearts that you are deceived.\r\nNothing will shake my belief that we are still as far from having\r\ndiscovered the dreadful truth as ever.\'\r\n\r\nHenry made no further attempt to dispute with her. She had impressed\r\nhim with a certain reluctant respect for her own opinion, in spite of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\'Have you thought of any better way of arriving at the truth?\' he\r\nasked. \'Who is to help us? No doubt there is the Countess, who has\r\nthe clue to the mystery in her own hands. But, in the present state of\r\nher mind, is her testimony to be trusted--even if she were willing to\r\nspeak? Judging by my own experience, I should say decidedly not.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that you have seen her again?\' Agnes eagerly\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\'Yes. I disturbed her once more over her endless writing; and I\r\ninsisted on her speaking out plainly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you told her what you found when you opened the hiding-place?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course I did!\' Henry replied. \'I said that I held her responsible\r\nfor the discovery, though I had not mentioned her connection with it to\r\nthe authorities as yet. She went on with her writing as if I had\r\nspoken in an unknown tongue! I was equally obstinate, on my side. I\r\ntold her plainly that the head had been placed under the care of the\r\npolice, and that the manager and I had signed our declarations and\r\ngiven our evidence. She paid not the slightest heed to me. By way of\r\ntempting her to speak, I added that the whole investigation was to be\r\nkept a secret, and that she might depend on my discretion. For the\r\nmoment I thought I had succeeded. She looked up from her writing with\r\na passing flash of curiosity, and said, "What are they going to do with\r\nit?"--meaning, I suppose, the head. I answered that it was to be\r\nprivately buried, after photographs of it had first been taken. I even\r\nwent the length of communicating the opinion of the surgeon consulted,\r\nthat some chemical means of arresting decomposition had been used and\r\nhad only partially succeeded--and I asked her point-blank if the\r\nsurgeon was right? The trap was not a bad one--but it completely\r\nfailed. She said in the coolest manner, "Now you are here, I should\r\nlike to consult you about my play; I am at a loss for some new\r\nincidents." Mind! there was nothing satirical in this. She was really\r\neager to read her wonderful work to me--evidently supposing that I took\r\na special interest in such things, because my brother is the manager of\r\na theatre! I left her, making the first excuse that occurred to me.\r\nSo far as I am concerned, I can do nothing with her. But it is\r\npossible that your influence may succeed with her again, as it has\r\nsucceeded already. Will you make the attempt, to satisfy your own\r\nmind? She is still upstairs; and I am quite ready to accompany you.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes shuddered at the bare suggestion of another interview with the\r\nCountess.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t! I daren\'t!\' she exclaimed. \'After what has happened in that\r\nhorrible room, she is more repellent to me than ever. Don\'t ask me to\r\ndo it, Henry! Feel my hand--you have turned me as cold as death only\r\nwith talking of it!\'\r\n\r\nShe was not exaggerating the terror that possessed her. Henry hastened\r\nto change the subject.\r\n\r\n\'Let us talk of something more interesting,\' he said. \'I have a\r\nquestion to ask you about yourself. Am I right in believing that the\r\nsooner you get away from Venice the happier you will be?\'\r\n\r\n\'Right?\' she repeated excitedly. \'You are more than right! No words\r\ncan say how I long to be away from this horrible place. But you know\r\nhow I am situated--you heard what Lord Montbarry said at dinner-time?\'\r\n\r\n\'Suppose he has altered his plans, since dinner-time?\' Henry suggested.\r\n\r\nAgnes looked surprised. \'I thought he had received letters from\r\nEngland which obliged him to leave Venice to-morrow,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Quite true,\' Henry admitted. \'He had arranged to start for England\r\nto-morrow, and to leave you and Lady Montbarry and the children to\r\nenjoy your holiday in Venice, under my care. Circumstances have\r\noccurred, however, which have forced him to alter his plans. He must\r\ntake you all back with him to-morrow because I am not able to assume\r\nthe charge of you. I am obliged to give up my holiday in Italy, and\r\nreturn to England too.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes looked at him in some little perplexity: she was not quite sure\r\nwhether she understood him or not.\r\n\r\n\'Are you really obliged to go back?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nHenry smiled as he answered her. \'Keep the secret,\' he said, \'or\r\nMontbarry will never forgive me!\'\r\n\r\nShe read the rest in his face. \'Oh!\' she exclaimed, blushing brightly,\r\n\'you have not given up your pleasant holiday in Italy on my account?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall go back with you to England, Agnes. That will be holiday\r\nenough for me.\'\r\n\r\nShe took his hand in an irrepressible outburst of gratitude. \'How good\r\nyou are to me!\' she murmured tenderly. \'What should I have done in the\r\ntroubles that have come to me, without your sympathy? I can\'t tell\r\nyou, Henry, how I feel your kindness.\'\r\n\r\nShe tried impulsively to lift his hand to her lips. He gently stopped\r\nher. \'Agnes,\' he said, \'are you beginning to understand how truly I\r\nlove you?\'\r\n\r\nThat simple question found its own way to her heart. She owned the\r\nwhole truth, without saying a word. She looked at him--and then looked\r\naway again.\r\n\r\nHe drew her nearer to him. \'My own darling!\' he whispered--and kissed\r\nher. Softly and tremulously, the sweet lips lingered, and touched his\r\nlips in return. Then her head drooped. She put her arms round his\r\nneck, and hid her face on his bosom. They spoke no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charmed silence had lasted but a little while, when it was\r\nmercilessly broken by a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nAgnes started to her feet. She placed herself at the piano; the\r\ninstrument being opposite to the door, it was impossible, when she\r\nseated herself on the music-stool, for any person entering the room to\r\nsee her face. Henry called out irritably, \'Come in.\'\r\n\r\nThe door was not opened. The person on the other side of it asked a\r\nstrange question.\r\n\r\n\'Is Mr. Henry Westwick alone?\'\r\n\r\nAgnes instantly recognised the voice of the Countess. She hurried to a\r\nsecond door, which communicated with one of the bedrooms. \'Don\'t let\r\nher come near me!\' she whispered nervously. \'Good night, Henry! good\r\nnight!\'\r\n\r\nIf Henry could, by an effort of will, have transported the Countess to\r\nthe uttermost ends of the earth, he would have made the effort without\r\nremorse. As it was, he only repeated, more irritably than ever, \'Come\r\nin!\'\r\n\r\nShe entered the room slowly with her everlasting manuscript in her\r\nhand. Her step was unsteady; a dark flush appeared on her face, in\r\nplace of its customary pallor; her eyes were bloodshot and widely\r\ndilated. In approaching Henry, she showed a strange incapability of\r\ncalculating her distances--she struck against the table near which he\r\nhappened to be sitting. When she spoke, her articulation was confused,\r\nand her pronunciation of some of the longer words was hardly\r\nintelligible. Most men would have suspected her of being under the\r\ninfluence of some intoxicating liquor. Henry took a truer view--he\r\nsaid, as he placed a chair for her, \'Countess, I am afraid you have\r\nbeen working too hard: you look as if you wanted rest.\'\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her head. \'My invention has gone,\' she said. \'I\r\ncan\'t write my fourth act. It\'s all a blank--all a blank!\'\r\n\r\nHenry advised her to wait till the next day. \'Go to bed,\' he\r\nsuggested; \'and try to sleep.\'\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand impatiently. \'I must finish the play,\' she\r\nanswered. \'I only want a hint from you. You must know something about\r\nplays. Your brother has got a theatre. You must often have heard him\r\ntalk about fourth and fifth acts--you must have seen rehearsals, and\r\nall the rest of it.\' She abruptly thrust the manuscript into Henry\'s\r\nhand. \'I can\'t read it to you,\' she said; \'I feel giddy when I look at\r\nmy own writing. Just run your eye over it, there\'s a good fellow--and\r\ngive me a hint.\'\r\n\r\nHenry glanced at the manuscript. He happened to look at the list of\r\nthe persons of the drama. As he read the list he started and turned\r\nabruptly to the Countess, intending to ask her for some explanation.\r\nThe words were suspended on his lips. It was but too plainly useless\r\nto speak to her. Her head lay back on the rail of the chair. She\r\nseemed to be half asleep already. The flush on her face had deepened:\r\nshe looked like a woman who was in danger of having a fit.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell, and directed the man who answered it to send one of\r\nthe chambermaids upstairs. His voice seemed to partially rouse the\r\nCountess; she opened her eyes in a slow drowsy way. \'Have you read\r\nit?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary as a mere act of humanity to humour her. \'I will read\r\nit willingly,\' said Henry, \'if you will go upstairs to bed. You shall\r\nhear what I think of it to-morrow morning. Our heads will be clearer,\r\nwe shall be better able to make the fourth act in the morning.\'\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid came in while he was speaking. \'I am afraid the lady\r\nis ill,\' Henry whispered. \'Take her up to her room.\' The woman looked\r\nat the Countess and whispered back, \'Shall we send for a doctor, sir?\'\r\n\r\nHenry advised taking her upstairs first, and then asking the manager\'s\r\nopinion. There was great difficulty in persuading her to rise, and\r\naccept the support of the chambermaid\'s arm. It was only by reiterated\r\npromises to read the play that night, and to make the fourth act in the\r\nmorning, that Henry prevailed on the Countess to return to her room.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, he began to feel a certain languid curiosity in\r\nrelation to the manuscript. He looked over the pages, reading a line\r\nhere and a line there. Suddenly he changed colour as he read--and\r\nlooked up from the manuscript like a man bewildered. \'Good God! what\r\ndoes this mean?\' he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHis eyes turned nervously to the door by which Agnes had left him. She\r\nmight return to the drawing-room, she might want to see what the\r\nCountess had written. He looked back again at the passage which had\r\nstartled him--considered with himself for a moment--and, snatching up\r\nthe unfinished play, suddenly and softly left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nEntering his own room on the upper floor, Henry placed the manuscript\r\non his table, open at the first leaf. His nerves were unquestionably\r\nshaken; his hand trembled as he turned the pages, he started at chance\r\nnoises on the staircase of the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe scenario, or outline, of the Countess\'s play began with no formal\r\nprefatory phrases. She presented herself and her work with the easy\r\nfamiliarity of an old friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Allow me, dear Mr. Francis Westwick, to introduce to you the persons\r\nin my proposed Play. Behold them, arranged symmetrically in a line.\r\n\r\n\'My Lord. The Baron. The Courier. The Doctor. The Countess.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t trouble myself, you see, to invest fictitious family names.\r\nMy characters are sufficiently distinguished by their social titles,\r\nand by the striking contrast which they present one with another.\r\n\r\nThe First Act opens-- \'No! Before I open the First Act, I must\r\nannounce, injustice to myself, that this Play is entirely the work of\r\nmy own invention. I scorn to borrow from actual events; and, what is\r\nmore extraordinary still, I have not stolen one of my ideas from the\r\nModern French drama. As the manager of an English theatre, you will\r\nnaturally refuse to believe this. It doesn\'t matter. Nothing\r\nmatters--except the opening of my first act.\r\n\r\n\'We are at Homburg, in the famous Salon d\'Or, at the height of the\r\nseason. The Countess (exquisitely dressed) is seated at the green\r\ntable. Strangers of all nations are standing behind the players,\r\nventuring their money or only looking on. My Lord is among the\r\nstrangers. He is struck by the Countess\'s personal appearance, in\r\nwhich beauties and defects are fantastically mingled in the most\r\nattractive manner. He watches the Countess\'s game, and places his\r\nmoney where he sees her deposit her own little stake. She looks round\r\nat him, and says, "Don\'t trust to my colour; I have been unlucky the\r\nwhole evening. Place your stake on the other colour, and you may have\r\na chance of winning." My Lord (a true Englishman) blushes, bows, and\r\nobeys. The Countess proves to be a prophet. She loses again. My Lord\r\nwins twice the sum that he has risked.\r\n\r\n\'The Countess rises from the table. She has no more money, and she\r\noffers my Lord her chair.\r\n\r\n\'Instead of taking it, he politely places his winnings in her hand, and\r\nbegs her to accept the loan as a favour to himself. The Countess\r\nstakes again, and loses again. My Lord smiles superbly, and presses a\r\nsecond loan on her. From that moment her luck turns. She wins, and\r\nwins largely. Her brother, the Baron, trying his fortune in another\r\nroom, hears of what is going on, and joins my Lord and the Countess.\r\n\r\n\'Pay attention, if you please, to the Baron. He is delineated as a\r\nremarkable and interesting character.\r\n\r\n\'This noble person has begun life with a single-minded devotion to the\r\nscience of experimental chemistry, very surprising in a young and\r\nhandsome man with a brilliant future before him. A profound knowledge\r\nof the occult sciences has persuaded the Baron that it is possible to\r\nsolve the famous problem called the "Philosopher\'s Stone." His own\r\npecuniary resources have long since been exhausted by his costly\r\nexperiments. His sister has next supplied him with the small fortune\r\nat her disposal: reserving only the family jewels, placed in the\r\ncharge of her banker and friend at Frankfort. The Countess\'s fortune\r\nalso being swallowed up, the Baron has in a fatal moment sought for new\r\nsupplies at the gaming table. He proves, at starting on his perilous\r\ncareer, to be a favourite of fortune; wins largely, and, alas! profanes\r\nhis noble enthusiasm for science by yielding his soul to the\r\nall-debasing passion of the gamester.\r\n\r\n\'At the period of the Play, the Baron\'s good fortune has deserted him.\r\nHe sees his way to a crowning experiment in the fatal search after the\r\nsecret of transmuting the baser elements into gold. But how is he to\r\npay the preliminary expenses? Destiny, like a mocking echo, answers,\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n\'Will his sister\'s winnings (with my Lord\'s money) prove large enough\r\nto help him? Eager for this result, he gives the Countess his advice\r\nhow to play. From that disastrous moment the infection of his own\r\nadverse fortune spreads to his sister. She loses again, and\r\nagain--loses to the last farthing.\r\n\r\n\'The amiable and wealthy Lord offers a third loan; but the scrupulous\r\nCountess positively refuses to take it. On leaving the table, she\r\npresents her brother to my Lord. The gentlemen fall into pleasant\r\ntalk. My Lord asks leave to pay his respects to the Countess, the next\r\nmorning, at her hotel. The Baron hospitably invites him to breakfast.\r\nMy Lord accepts, with a last admiring glance at the Countess which does\r\nnot escape her brother\'s observation, and takes his leave for the night.\r\n\r\n\'Alone with his sister, the Baron speaks out plainly. "Our affairs,"\r\nhe says, "are in a desperate condition, and must find a desperate\r\nremedy. Wait for me here, while I make inquiries about my Lord. You\r\nhave evidently produced a strong impression on him. If we can turn\r\nthat impression into money, no matter at what sacrifice, the thing must\r\nbe done."\r\n\r\n\'The Countess now occupies the stage alone, and indulges in a soliloquy\r\nwhich develops her character.\r\n\r\n\'It is at once a dangerous and attractive character. Immense\r\ncapacities for good are implanted in her nature, side by side with\r\nequally remarkable capacities for evil. It rests with circumstances to\r\ndevelop either the one or the other. Being a person who produces a\r\nsensation wherever she goes, this noble lady is naturally made the\r\nsubject of all sorts of scandalous reports. To one of these reports\r\n(which falsely and abominably points to the Baron as her lover instead\r\nof her brother) she now refers with just indignation. She has just\r\nexpressed her desire to leave Homburg, as the place in which the vile\r\ncalumny first took its rise, when the Baron returns, overhears her last\r\nwords, and says to her, "Yes, leave Homburg by all means; provided you\r\nleave it in the character of my Lord\'s betrothed wife!"\r\n\r\n\'The Countess is startled and shocked. She protests that she does not\r\nreciprocate my Lord\'s admiration for her. She even goes the length of\r\nrefusing to see him again. The Baron answers, "I must positively have\r\ncommand of money. Take your choice, between marrying my Lord\'s income,\r\nin the interest of my grand discovery--or leave me to sell myself and\r\nmy title to the first rich woman of low degree who is ready to buy me."\r\n\r\n\'The Countess listens in surprise and dismay. Is it possible that the\r\nBaron is in earnest? He is horribly in earnest. "The woman who will\r\nbuy me," he says, "is in the next room to us at this moment. She is\r\nthe wealthy widow of a Jewish usurer. She has the money I want to\r\nreach the solution of the great problem. I have only to be that\r\nwoman\'s husband, and to make myself master of untold millions of gold.\r\nTake five minutes to consider what I have said to you, and tell me on\r\nmy return which of us is to marry for the money I want, you or I."\r\n\r\n\'As he turns away, the Countess stops him.\r\n\r\n\'All the noblest sentiments in her nature are exalted to the highest\r\npitch. "Where is the true woman," she exclaims, "who wants time to\r\nconsummate the sacrifice of herself, when the man to whom she is\r\ndevoted demands it? She does not want five minutes--she does not want\r\nfive seconds--she holds out her hand to him, and she says, Sacrifice me\r\non the altar of your glory! Take as stepping-stones on the way to your\r\ntriumph, my love, my liberty, and my life!"\r\n\r\n\'On this grand situation the curtain falls. Judging by my first act,\r\nMr. Westwick, tell me truly, and don\'t be afraid of turning my head:--\r\nAm I not capable of writing a good play?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry paused between the First and Second Acts; reflecting, not on the\r\nmerits of the play, but on the strange resemblance which the incidents\r\nso far presented to the incidents that had attended the disastrous\r\nmarriage of the first Lord Montbarry.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that the Countess, in the present condition of her\r\nmind, supposed herself to be exercising her invention when she was only\r\nexercising her memory?\r\n\r\nThe question involved considerations too serious to be made the subject\r\nof a hasty decision. Reserving his opinion, Henry turned the page, and\r\ndevoted himself to the reading of the next act. The manuscript\r\nproceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\'The Second Act opens at Venice. An interval of four months has\r\nelapsed since the date of the scene at the gambling table. The action\r\nnow takes place in the reception-room of one of the Venetian palaces.\r\n\r\n\'The Baron is discovered, alone, on the stage. He reverts to the\r\nevents which have happened since the close of the First Act. The\r\nCountess has sacrificed herself; the mercenary marriage has taken\r\nplace--but not without obstacles, caused by difference of opinion on\r\nthe question of marriage settlements.\r\n\r\n\'Private inquiries, instituted in England, have informed the Baron that\r\nmy Lord\'s income is derived chiefly from what is called entailed\r\nproperty. In case of accidents, he is surely bound to do something for\r\nhis bride? Let him, for example, insure his life, for a sum proposed\r\nby the Baron, and let him so settle the money that his widow shall have\r\nit, if he dies first.\r\n\r\n\'My Lord hesitates. The Baron wastes no time in useless discussion.\r\n"Let us by all means" (he says) "consider the marriage as broken off."\r\nMy Lord shifts his ground, and pleads for a smaller sum than the sum\r\nproposed. The Baron briefly replies, "I never bargain." My lord is in\r\nlove; the natural result follows--he gives way.\r\n\r\n\'So far, the Baron has no cause to complain. But my Lord\'s turn comes,\r\nwhen the marriage has been celebrated, and when the honeymoon is over.\r\nThe Baron has joined the married pair at a palace which they have hired\r\nin Venice. He is still bent on solving the problem of the\r\n"Philosopher\'s Stone." His laboratory is set up in the vaults beneath\r\nthe palace--so that smells from chemical experiments may not incommode\r\nthe Countess, in the higher regions of the house. The one obstacle in\r\nthe way of his grand discovery is, as usual, the want of money. His\r\nposition at the present time has become truly critical. He owes debts\r\nof honour to gentlemen in his own rank of life, which must positively\r\nbe paid; and he proposes, in his own friendly manner, to borrow the\r\nmoney of my Lord. My Lord positively refuses, in the rudest terms.\r\nThe Baron applies to his sister to exercise her conjugal influence.\r\nShe can only answer that her noble husband (being no longer\r\ndistractedly in love with her) now appears in his true character, as\r\none of the meanest men living. The sacrifice of the marriage has been\r\nmade, and has already proved useless.\r\n\r\n\'Such is the state of affairs at the opening of the Second Act.\r\n\r\n\'The entrance of the Countess suddenly disturbs the Baron\'s\r\nreflections. She is in a state bordering on frenzy. Incoherent\r\nexpressions of rage burst from her lips: it is some time before she\r\ncan sufficiently control herself to speak plainly. She has been doubly\r\ninsulted--first, by a menial person in her employment; secondly, by her\r\nhusband. Her maid, an Englishwoman, has declared that she will serve\r\nthe Countess no longer. She will give up her wages, and return at once\r\nto England. Being asked her reason for this strange proceeding, she\r\ninsolently hints that the Countess\'s service is no service for an\r\nhonest woman, since the Baron has entered the house. The Countess\r\ndoes, what any lady in her position would do; she indignantly dismisses\r\nthe wretch on the spot.\r\n\r\n\'My Lord, hearing his wife\'s voice raised in anger, leaves the study in\r\nwhich he is accustomed to shut himself up over his books, and asks what\r\nthis disturbance means. The Countess informs him of the outrageous\r\nlanguage and conduct of her maid. My Lord not only declares his entire\r\napproval of the woman\'s conduct, but expresses his own abominable\r\ndoubts of his wife\'s fidelity in language of such horrible brutality\r\nthat no lady could pollute her lips by repeating it. "If I had been a\r\nman," the Countess says, "and if I had had a weapon in my hand, I would\r\nhave struck him dead at my feet!"\r\n\r\n\'The Baron, listening silently so far, now speaks. "Permit me to\r\nfinish the sentence for you," he says. "You would have struck your\r\nhusband dead at your feet; and by that rash act, you would have\r\ndeprived yourself of the insurance money settled on the widow--the very\r\nmoney which is wanted to relieve your brother from the unendurable\r\npecuniary position which he now occupies!"\r\n\r\n\'The Countess gravely reminds the Baron that this is no joking matter.\r\nAfter what my Lord has said to her, she has little doubt that he will\r\ncommunicate his infamous suspicions to his lawyers in England. If\r\nnothing is done to prevent it, she may be divorced and disgraced, and\r\nthrown on the world, with no resource but the sale of her jewels to\r\nkeep her from starving.\r\n\r\n\'At this moment, the Courier who has been engaged to travel with my\r\nLord from England crosses the stage with a letter to take to the post.\r\nThe Countess stops him, and asks to look at the address on the letter.\r\nShe takes it from him for a moment, and shows it to her brother. The\r\nhandwriting is my Lord\'s; and the letter is directed to his lawyers in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\'The Courier proceeds to the post-office. The Baron and the Countess\r\nlook at each other in silence. No words are needed. They thoroughly\r\nunderstand the position in which they are placed; they clearly see the\r\nterrible remedy for it. What is the plain alternative before them?\r\nDisgrace and ruin--or, my Lord\'s death and the insurance money!\r\n\r\n\'The Baron walks backwards and forwards in great agitation, talking to\r\nhimself. The Countess hears fragments of what he is saying. He speaks\r\nof my Lord\'s constitution, probably weakened in India--of a cold which\r\nmy Lord has caught two or three days since--of the remarkable manner in\r\nwhich such slight things as colds sometimes end in serious illness and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\'He observes that the Countess is listening to him, and asks if she has\r\nanything to propose. She is a woman who, with many defects, has the\r\ngreat merit of speaking out. "Is there no such thing as a serious\r\nillness," she asks, "corked up in one of those bottles of yours in the\r\nvaults downstairs?"\r\n\r\n\'The Baron answers by gravely shaking his head. What is he afraid\r\nof?--a possible examination of the body after death? No: he can set\r\nany post-mortem examination at defiance. It is the process of\r\nadministering the poison that he dreads. A man so distinguished as my\r\nLord cannot be taken seriously ill without medical attendance. Where\r\nthere is a Doctor, there is always danger of discovery. Then, again,\r\nthere is the Courier, faithful to my Lord as long as my Lord pays him.\r\nEven if the Doctor sees nothing suspicious, the Courier may discover\r\nsomething. The poison, to do its work with the necessary secrecy, must\r\nbe repeatedly administered in graduated doses. One trifling\r\nmiscalculation or mistake may rouse suspicion. The insurance offices\r\nmay hear of it, and may refuse to pay the money. As things are, the\r\nBaron will not risk it, and will not allow his sister to risk it in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\'My Lord himself is the next character who appears. He has repeatedly\r\nrung for the Courier, and the bell has not been answered. "What does\r\nthis insolence mean?"\r\n\r\n\'The Countess (speaking with quiet dignity--for why should her infamous\r\nhusband have the satisfaction of knowing how deeply he has wounded\r\nher?) reminds my Lord that the Courier has gone to the post. My Lord\r\nasks suspiciously if she has looked at the letter. The Countess\r\ninforms him coldly that she has no curiosity about his letters.\r\nReferring to the cold from which he is suffering, she inquires if he\r\nthinks of consulting a medical man. My Lord answers roughly that he is\r\nquite old enough to be capable of doctoring himself.\r\n\r\n\'As he makes this reply, the Courier appears, returning from the post.\r\nMy Lord gives him orders to go out again and buy some lemons. He\r\nproposes to try hot lemonade as a means of inducing perspiration in\r\nbed. In that way he has formerly cured colds, and in that way he will\r\ncure the cold from which he is suffering now.\r\n\r\n\'The Courier obeys in silence. Judging by appearances, he goes very\r\nreluctantly on this second errand.\r\n\r\n\'My Lord turns to the Baron (who has thus far taken no part in the\r\nconversation) and asks him, in a sneering tone, how much longer he\r\nproposes to prolong his stay in Venice. The Baron answers quietly,\r\n"Let us speak plainly to one another, my Lord. If you wish me to leave\r\nyour house, you have only to say the word, and I go." My Lord turns to\r\nhis wife, and asks if she can support the calamity of her brother\'s\r\nabsence--laying a grossly insulting emphasis on the word "brother."\r\nThe Countess preserves her impenetrable composure; nothing in her\r\nbetrays the deadly hatred with which she regards the titled ruffian who\r\nhas insulted her. "You are master in this house, my Lord," is all she\r\nsays. "Do as you please."\r\n\r\n\'My Lord looks at his wife; looks at the Baron--and suddenly alters his\r\ntone. Does he perceive in the composure of the Countess and her\r\nbrother something lurking under the surface that threatens him? This\r\nis at least certain, he makes a clumsy apology for the language that he\r\nhas used. (Abject wretch!)\r\n\r\n\'My Lord\'s excuses are interrupted by the return of the Courier with\r\nthe lemons and hot water.\r\n\r\n\'The Countess observes for the first time that the man looks ill. His\r\nhands tremble as he places the tray on the table. My Lord orders his\r\nCourier to follow him, and make the lemonade in the bedroom. The\r\nCountess remarks that the Courier seems hardly capable of obeying his\r\norders. Hearing this, the man admits that he is ill. He, too, is\r\nsuffering from a cold; he has been kept waiting in a draught at the\r\nshop where he bought the lemons; he feels alternately hot and cold, and\r\nhe begs permission to lie down for a little while on his bed.\r\n\r\n\'Feeling her humanity appealed to, the Countess volunteers to make the\r\nlemonade herself. My Lord takes the Courier by the arm, leads him\r\naside, and whispers these words to him: "Watch her, and see that she\r\nputs nothing into the lemonade; then bring it to me with your own\r\nhands; and, then, go to bed, if you like."\r\n\r\n\'Without a word more to his wife, or to the Baron, my Lord leaves the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\'The Countess makes the lemonade, and the Courier takes it to his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\'Returning, on the way to his own room, he is so weak, and feels, he\r\nsays, so giddy, that he is obliged to support himself by the backs of\r\nthe chairs as he passes them. The Baron, always considerate to persons\r\nof low degree, offers his arm. "I am afraid, my poor fellow," he says,\r\n"that you are really ill." The Courier makes this extraordinary answer:\r\n"It\'s all over with me, Sir: I have caught my death."\r\n\r\n\'The Countess is naturally startled. "You are not an old man," she\r\nsays, trying to rouse the Courier\'s spirits. "At your age, catching\r\ncold doesn\'t surely mean catching your death?" The Courier fixes his\r\neyes despairingly on the Countess.\r\n\r\n"My lungs are weak, my Lady," he says; "I have already had two attacks\r\nof bronchitis. The second time, a great physician joined my own doctor\r\nin attendance on me. He considered my recovery almost in the light of\r\na miracle. Take care of yourself," he said. "If you have a third\r\nattack of bronchitis, as certainly as two and two make four, you will\r\nbe a dead man. I feel the same inward shivering, my Lady, that I felt\r\non those two former occasions--and I tell you again, I have caught my\r\ndeath in Venice."\r\n\r\n\'Speaking some comforting words, the Baron leads him to his room. The\r\nCountess is left alone on the stage.\r\n\r\n\'She seats herself, and looks towards the door by which the Courier has\r\nbeen led out. "Ah! my poor fellow," she says, "if you could only\r\nchange constitutions with my Lord, what a happy result would follow for\r\nthe Baron and for me! If you could only get cured of a trumpery cold\r\nwith a little hot lemonade, and if he could only catch his death in\r\nyour place--!"\r\n\r\n\'She suddenly pauses--considers for a while--and springs to her feet,\r\nwith a cry of triumphant surprise: the wonderful, the unparalleled\r\nidea has crossed her mind like a flash of lightning. Make the two men\r\nchange names and places--and the deed is done! Where are the\r\nobstacles? Remove my Lord (by fair means or foul) from his room; and\r\nkeep him secretly prisoner in the palace, to live or die as future\r\nnecessity may determine. Place the Courier in the vacant bed, and call\r\nin the doctor to see him--ill, in my Lord\'s character, and (if he dies)\r\ndying under my Lord\'s name!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manuscript dropped from Henry\'s hands. A sickening sense of horror\r\noverpowered him. The question which had occurred to his mind at the\r\nclose of the First Act of the Play assumed a new and terrible interest\r\nnow. As far as the scene of the Countess\'s soliloquy, the incidents of\r\nthe Second Act had reflected the events of his late brother\'s life as\r\nfaithfully as the incidents of the First Act. Was the monstrous plot,\r\nrevealed in the lines which he had just read, the offspring of the\r\nCountess\'s morbid imagination? or had she, in this case also, deluded\r\nherself with the idea that she was inventing when she was really\r\nwriting under the influence of her own guilty remembrances of the past?\r\nIf the latter interpretation were the true one, he had just read the\r\nnarrative of the contemplated murder of his brother, planned in cold\r\nblood by a woman who was at that moment inhabiting the same house with\r\nhim. While, to make the fatality complete, Agnes herself had\r\ninnocently provided the conspirators with the one man who was fitted to\r\nbe the passive agent of their crime.\r\n\r\nEven the bare doubt that it might be so was more than he could endure.\r\nHe left his room; resolved to force the truth out of the Countess, or\r\nto denounce her before the authorities as a murderess at large.\r\n\r\nArrived at her door, he was met by a person just leaving the room. The\r\nperson was the manager. He was hardly recognisable; he looked and\r\nspoke like a man in a state of desperation.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, go in, if you like!\' he said to Henry. \'Mark this, sir! I am not\r\na superstitious man; but I do begin to believe that crimes carry their\r\nown curse with them. This hotel is under a curse. What happens in the\r\nmorning? We discover a crime committed in the old days of the palace.\r\nThe night comes, and brings another dreadful event with it--a death; a\r\nsudden and shocking death, in the house. Go in, and see for yourself!\r\nI shall resign my situation, Mr. Westwick: I can\'t contend with the\r\nfatalities that pursue me here!\'\r\n\r\nHenry entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe Countess was stretched on her bed. The doctor on one side, and the\r\nchambermaid on the other, were standing looking at her. From time to\r\ntime, she drew a heavy stertorous breath, like a person oppressed in\r\nsleeping. \'Is she likely to die?\' Henry asked.\r\n\r\n\'She is dead,\' the doctor answered. \'Dead of the rupture of a\r\nblood-vessel on the brain. Those sounds that you hear are purely\r\nmechanical--they may go on for hours.\'\r\n\r\nHenry looked at the chambermaid. She had little to tell. The Countess\r\nhad refused to go to bed, and had placed herself at her desk to proceed\r\nwith her writing. Finding it useless to remonstrate with her, the maid\r\nhad left the room to speak to the manager. In the shortest possible\r\ntime, the doctor was summoned to the hotel, and found the Countess dead\r\non the floor. There was this to tell--and no more.\r\n\r\nLooking at the writing-table as he went out, Henry saw the sheet of\r\npaper on which the Countess had traced her last lines of writing. The\r\ncharacters were almost illegible. Henry could just distinguish the\r\nwords, \'First Act,\' and \'Persons of the Drama.\' The lost wretch had\r\nbeen thinking of her Play to the last, and had begun it all over again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry returned to his room.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to throw aside the manuscript, and never to look\r\nat it again. The one chance of relieving his mind from the dreadful\r\nuncertainty that oppressed it, by obtaining positive evidence of the\r\ntruth, was a chance annihilated by the Countess\'s death. What good\r\npurpose could be served, what relief could he anticipate, if he read\r\nmore?\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the room. After an interval, his thoughts took a\r\nnew direction; the question of the manuscript presented itself under\r\nanother point of view. Thus far, his reading had only informed him\r\nthat the conspiracy had been planned. How did he know that the plan\r\nhad been put in execution?\r\n\r\nThe manuscript lay just before him on the floor. He hesitated; then\r\npicked it up; and, returning to the table, read on as follows, from the\r\npoint at which he had left off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\'While the Countess is still absorbed in the bold yet simple\r\ncombination of circumstances which she has discovered, the Baron\r\nreturns. He takes a serious view of the case of the Courier; it may be\r\nnecessary, he thinks, to send for medical advice. No servant is left\r\nin the palace, now the English maid has taken her departure. The Baron\r\nhimself must fetch the doctor, if the doctor is really needed.\r\n\r\n\'"Let us have medical help, by all means," his sister replies. "But\r\nwait and hear something that I have to say to you first." She then\r\nelectrifies the Baron by communicating her idea to him. What danger of\r\ndiscovery have they to dread? My Lord\'s life in Venice has been a life\r\nof absolute seclusion: nobody but his banker knows him, even by\r\npersonal appearance. He has presented his letter of credit as a\r\nperfect stranger; and he and his banker have never seen each other\r\nsince that first visit. He has given no parties, and gone to no\r\nparties. On the few occasions when he has hired a gondola or taken a\r\nwalk, he has always been alone. Thanks to the atrocious suspicion\r\nwhich makes him ashamed of being seen with his wife, he has led the\r\nvery life which makes the proposed enterprise easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\'The cautious Baron listens--but gives no positive opinion, as yet.\r\n"See what you can do with the Courier," he says; "and I will decide\r\nwhen I hear the result. One valuable hint I may give you before you\r\ngo. Your man is easily tempted by money--if you only offer him enough.\r\nThe other day, I asked him, in jest, what he would do for a thousand\r\npounds. He answered, \'Anything.\' Bear that in mind; and offer your\r\nhighest bid without bargaining."\r\n\r\n\'The scene changes to the Courier\'s room, and shows the poor wretch\r\nwith a photographic portrait of his wife in his hand, crying. The\r\nCountess enters.\r\n\r\n\'She wisely begins by sympathising with her contemplated accomplice.\r\nHe is duly grateful; he confides his sorrows to his gracious mistress.\r\nNow that he believes himself to be on his death-bed, he feels remorse\r\nfor his neglectful treatment of his wife. He could resign himself to\r\ndie; but despair overpowers him when he remembers that he has saved no\r\nmoney, and that he will leave his widow, without resources, to the\r\nmercy of the world.\r\n\r\n\'On this hint, the Countess speaks. "Suppose you were asked to do a\r\nperfectly easy thing," she says; "and suppose you were rewarded for\r\ndoing it by a present of a thousand pounds, as a legacy for your widow?"\r\n\r\n\'The Courier raises himself on his pillow, and looks at the Countess\r\nwith an expression of incredulous surprise. She can hardly be cruel\r\nenough (he thinks) to joke with a man in his miserable plight. Will\r\nshe say plainly what this perfectly easy thing is, the doing of which\r\nwill meet with such a magnificent reward?\r\n\r\n\'The Countess answers that question by confiding her project to the\r\nCourier, without the slightest reserve.\r\n\r\n\'Some minutes of silence follow when she has done. The Courier is not\r\nweak enough yet to speak without stopping to think first. Still\r\nkeeping his eyes on the Countess, he makes a quaintly insolent remark\r\non what he has just heard. "I have not hitherto been a religious man;\r\nbut I feel myself on the way to it. Since your ladyship has spoken to\r\nme, I believe in the Devil." It is the Countess\'s interest to see the\r\nhumorous side of this confession of faith. She takes no offence. She\r\nonly says, "I will give you half an hour by yourself, to think over my\r\nproposal. You are in danger of death. Decide, in your wife\'s\r\ninterests, whether you will die worth nothing, or die worth a thousand\r\npounds."\r\n\r\n\'Left alone, the Courier seriously considers his position--and decides.\r\nHe rises with difficulty; writes a few lines on a leaf taken from his\r\npocket-book; and, with slow and faltering steps, leaves the room.\r\n\r\n\'The Countess, returning at the expiration of the half-hour\'s interval,\r\nfinds the room empty. While she is wondering, the Courier opens the\r\ndoor. What has he been doing out of his bed? He answers, "I have been\r\nprotecting my own life, my lady, on the bare chance that I may recover\r\nfrom the bronchitis for the third time. If you or the Baron attempts\r\nto hurry me out of this world, or to deprive me of my thousand pounds\r\nreward, I shall tell the doctor where he will find a few lines of\r\nwriting, which describe your ladyship\'s plot. I may not have strength\r\nenough, in the case supposed, to betray you by making a complete\r\nconfession with my own lips; but I can employ my last breath to speak\r\nthe half-dozen words which will tell the doctor where he is to look.\r\nThose words, it is needless to add, will be addressed to your Ladyship,\r\nif I find your engagements towards me faithfully kept."\r\n\r\n\'With this audacious preface, he proceeds to state the conditions on\r\nwhich he will play his part in the conspiracy, and die (if he does die)\r\nworth a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\'Either the Countess or the Baron are to taste the food and drink\r\nbrought to his bedside, in his presence, and even the medicines which\r\nthe doctor may prescribe for him. As for the promised sum of money, it\r\nis to be produced in one bank-note, folded in a sheet of paper, on\r\nwhich a line is to be written, dictated by the Courier. The two\r\nenclosures are then to be sealed up in an envelope, addressed to his\r\nwife, and stamped ready for the post. This done, the letter is to be\r\nplaced under his pillow; the Baron or the Countess being at liberty to\r\nsatisfy themselves, day by day, at their own time, that the letter\r\nremains in its place, with the seal unbroken, as long as the doctor has\r\nany hope of his patient\'s recovery. The last stipulation follows. The\r\nCourier has a conscience; and with a view to keeping it easy, insists\r\nthat he shall be left in ignorance of that part of the plot which\r\nrelates to the sequestration of my Lord. Not that he cares\r\nparticularly what becomes of his miserly master--but he does dislike\r\ntaking other people\'s responsibilities on his own shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'These conditions being agreed to, the Countess calls in the Baron, who\r\nhas been waiting events in the next room.\r\n\r\n\'He is informed that the Courier has yielded to temptation; but he is\r\nstill too cautious to make any compromising remarks. Keeping his back\r\nturned on the bed, he shows a bottle to the Countess. It is labelled\r\n"Chloroform." She understands that my Lord is to be removed from his\r\nroom in a convenient state of insensibility. In what part of the\r\npalace is he to be hidden? As they open the door to go out, the\r\nCountess whispers that question to the Baron. The Baron whispers back,\r\n"In the vaults!" The curtain falls.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Second Act ended.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Third Act, Henry looked wearily at the pages as he let\r\nthem slip through his fingers. Both in mind and body, he began to feel\r\nthe need of repose.\r\n\r\nIn one important respect, the later portion of the manuscript differed\r\nfrom the pages which he had just been reading. Signs of an overwrought\r\nbrain showed themselves, here and there, as the outline of the play\r\napproached its end. The handwriting grew worse and worse. Some of the\r\nlonger sentences were left unfinished. In the exchange of dialogue,\r\nquestions and answers were not always attributed respectively to the\r\nright speaker. At certain intervals the writer\'s failing intelligence\r\nseemed to recover itself for a while; only to relapse again, and to\r\nlose the thread of the narrative more hopelessly than ever.\r\n\r\nAfter reading one or two of the more coherent passages Henry recoiled\r\nfrom the ever-darkening horror of the story. He closed the manuscript,\r\nheartsick and exhausted, and threw himself on his bed to rest. The\r\ndoor opened almost at the same moment. Lord Montbarry entered the room.\r\n\r\n\'We have just returned from the Opera,\' he said; \'and we have heard the\r\nnews of that miserable woman\'s death. They say you spoke to her in her\r\nlast moments; and I want to hear how it happened.\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall hear how it happened,\' Henry answered; \'and more than that.\r\nYou are now the head of the family, Stephen; and I feel bound, in the\r\nposition which oppresses me, to leave you to decide what ought to be\r\ndone.\'\r\n\r\nWith those introductory words, he told his brother how the Countess\'s\r\nplay had come into his hands. \'Read the first few pages,\' he said. \'I\r\nam anxious to know whether the same impression is produced on both of\r\nus.\'\r\n\r\nBefore Lord Montbarry had got half-way through the First Act, he\r\nstopped, and looked at his brother. \'What does she mean by boasting of\r\nthis as her own invention?\' he asked. \'Was she too crazy to remember\r\nthat these things really happened?\'\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Henry: the same impression had been produced on\r\nboth of them. \'You will do as you please,\' he said. \'But if you will\r\nbe guided by me, spare yourself the reading of those pages to come,\r\nwhich describe our brother\'s terrible expiation of his heartless\r\nmarriage.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you read it all, Henry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not all. I shrank from reading some of the latter part of it.\r\nNeither you nor I saw much of our elder brother after we left school;\r\nand, for my part, I felt, and never scrupled to express my feeling,\r\nthat he behaved infamously to Agnes. But when I read that unconscious\r\nconfession of the murderous conspiracy to which he fell a victim, I\r\nremembered, with something like remorse, that the same mother bore us.\r\nI have felt for him to-night, what I am ashamed to think I never felt\r\nfor him before.\'\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry took his brother\'s hand.\r\n\r\n\'You are a good fellow, Henry,\' he said; \'but are you quite sure that\r\nyou have not been needlessly distressing yourself? Because some of\r\nthis crazy creature\'s writing accidentally tells what we know to be the\r\ntruth, does it follow that all the rest is to be relied on to the end?\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no possible doubt of it,\' Henry replied.\r\n\r\n\'No possible doubt?\' his brother repeated. \'I shall go on with my\r\nreading, Henry--and see what justification there may be for that\r\nconfident conclusion of yours.\'\r\n\r\nHe read on steadily, until he had reached the end of the Second Act.\r\nThen he looked up.\r\n\r\n\'Do you really believe that the mutilated remains which you discovered\r\nthis morning are the remains of our brother?\' he asked. \'And do you\r\nbelieve it on such evidence as this?\'\r\n\r\nHenry answered silently by a sign in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry checked himself--evidently on the point of entering an\r\nindignant protest.\r\n\r\n\'You acknowledge that you have not read the later scenes of the piece,\'\r\nhe said. \'Don\'t be childish, Henry! If you persist in pinning your\r\nfaith on such stuff as this, the least you can do is to make yourself\r\nthoroughly acquainted with it. Will you read the Third Act? No? Then\r\nI shall read it to you.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned to the Third Act, and ran over those fragmentary passages\r\nwhich were clearly enough written and expressed to be intelligible to\r\nthe mind of a stranger.\r\n\r\n\'Here is a scene in the vaults of the palace,\' he began. \'The victim\r\nof the conspiracy is sleeping on his miserable bed; and the Baron and\r\nthe Countess are considering the position in which they stand. The\r\nCountess (as well as I can make it out) has raised the money that is\r\nwanted by borrowing on the security of her jewels at Frankfort; and the\r\nCourier upstairs is still declared by the Doctor to have a chance of\r\nrecovery. What are the conspirators to do, if the man does recover?\r\nThe cautious Baron suggests setting the prisoner free. If he ventures\r\nto appeal to the law, it is easy to declare that he is subject to\r\ninsane delusion, and to call his own wife as witness. On the other\r\nhand, if the Courier dies, how is the sequestrated and unknown nobleman\r\nto be put out of the way? Passively, by letting him starve in his\r\nprison? No: the Baron is a man of refined tastes; he dislikes\r\nneedless cruelty. The active policy remains--say, assassination by the\r\nknife of a hired bravo? The Baron objects to trusting an accomplice;\r\nalso to spending money on anyone but himself. Shall they drop their\r\nprisoner into the canal? The Baron declines to trust water; water will\r\nshow him on the surface. Shall they set his bed on fire? An excellent\r\nidea; but the smoke might be seen. No: the circumstances being now\r\nentirely altered, poisoning him presents the easiest way out of it. He\r\nhas simply become a superfluous person. The cheapest poison will\r\ndo.--Is it possible, Henry, that you believe this consultation really\r\ntook place?\'\r\n\r\nHenry made no reply. The succession of the questions that had just\r\nbeen read to him, exactly followed the succession of the dreams that\r\nhad terrified Mrs. Norbury, on the two nights which she had passed in\r\nthe hotel. It was useless to point out this coincidence to his\r\nbrother. He only said, \'Go on.\'\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry turned the pages until he came to the next intelligible\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\'Here,\' he proceeded, \'is a double scene on the stage--so far as I can\r\nunderstand the sketch of it. The Doctor is upstairs, innocently\r\nwriting his certificate of my Lord\'s decease, by the dead Courier\'s\r\nbedside. Down in the vaults, the Baron stands by the corpse of the\r\npoisoned lord, preparing the strong chemical acids which are to reduce\r\nit to a heap of ashes--Surely, it is not worth while to trouble\r\nourselves with deciphering such melodramatic horrors as these? Let us\r\nget on! let us get on!\'\r\n\r\nHe turned the leaves again; attempting vainly to discover the meaning\r\nof the confused scenes that followed. On the last page but one, he\r\nfound the last intelligible sentences.\r\n\r\n\'The Third Act seems to be divided,\' he said, \'into two Parts or\r\nTableaux. I think I can read the writing at the beginning of the\r\nSecond Part. The Baron and the Countess open the scene. The Baron\'s\r\nhands are mysteriously concealed by gloves. He has reduced the body to\r\nashes by his own system of cremation, with the exception of the head--\'\r\n\r\nHenry interrupted his brother there. \'Don\'t read any more!\' he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'Let us do the Countess justice,\' Lord Montbarry persisted. \'There are\r\nnot half a dozen lines more that I can make out! The accidental\r\nbreaking of his jar of acid has burnt the Baron\'s hands severely. He\r\nis still unable to proceed to the destruction of the head--and the\r\nCountess is woman enough (with all her wickedness) to shrink from\r\nattempting to take his place--when the first news is received of the\r\ncoming arrival of the commission of inquiry despatched by the insurance\r\noffices. The Baron feels no alarm. Inquire as the commission may, it\r\nis the natural death of the Courier (in my Lord\'s character) that they\r\nare blindly investigating. The head not being destroyed, the obvious\r\nalternative is to hide it--and the Baron is equal to the occasion. His\r\nstudies in the old library have informed him of a safe place of\r\nconcealment in the palace. The Countess may recoil from handling the\r\nacids and watching the process of cremation; but she can surely\r\nsprinkle a little disinfecting powder--\'\r\n\r\n\'No more!\' Henry reiterated. \'No more!\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no more that can be read, my dear fellow. The last page\r\nlooks like sheer delirium. She may well have told you that her\r\ninvention had failed her!\'\r\n\r\n\'Face the truth honestly, Stephen, and say her memory.\'\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry rose from the table at which he had been sitting, and\r\nlooked at his brother with pitying eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Your nerves are out of order, Henry,\' he said. \'And no wonder, after\r\nthat frightful discovery under the hearth-stone. We won\'t dispute about\r\nit; we will wait a day or two until you are quite yourself again. In\r\nthe meantime, let us understand each other on one point at least. You\r\nleave the question of what is to be done with these pages of writing to\r\nme, as the head of the family?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do.\'\r\n\r\nLord Montbarry quietly took up the manuscript, and threw it into the\r\nfire. \'Let this rubbish be of some use,\' he said, holding the pages\r\ndown with the poker. \'The room is getting chilly--the Countess\'s play\r\nwill set some of these charred logs flaming again.\' He waited a little\r\nat the fire-place, and returned to his brother. \'Now, Henry, I have a\r\nlast word to say, and then I have done. I am ready to admit that you\r\nhave stumbled, by an unlucky chance, on the proof of a crime committed\r\nin the old days of the palace, nobody knows how long ago. With that\r\none concession, I dispute everything else. Rather than agree in the\r\nopinion you have formed, I won\'t believe anything that has happened.\r\nThe supernatural influences that some of us felt when we first slept in\r\nthis hotel--your loss of appetite, our sister\'s dreadful dreams, the\r\nsmell that overpowered Francis, and the head that appeared to Agnes--I\r\ndeclare them all to be sheer delusions! I believe in nothing, nothing,\r\nnothing!\' He opened the door to go out, and looked back into the room.\r\n\'Yes,\' he resumed, \'there is one thing I believe in. My wife has\r\ncommitted a breach of confidence--I believe Agnes will marry you. Good\r\nnight, Henry. We leave Venice the first thing to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nSo Lord Montbarry disposed of the mystery of The Haunted Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nA last chance of deciding the difference of opinion between the two\r\nbrothers remained in Henry\'s possession. He had his own idea of the\r\nuse to which he might put the false teeth as a means of inquiry when he\r\nand his fellow-travellers returned to England.\r\n\r\nThe only surviving depositary of the domestic history of the family in\r\npast years, was Agnes Lockwood\'s old nurse. Henry took his first\r\nopportunity of trying to revive her personal recollections of the\r\ndeceased Lord Montbarry. But the nurse had never forgiven the great\r\nman of the family for his desertion of Agnes; she flatly refused to\r\nconsult her memory. \'Even the bare sight of my lord, when I last saw\r\nhim in London,\' said the old woman, \'made my finger-nails itch to set\r\ntheir mark on his face. I was sent on an errand by Miss Agnes; and I\r\nmet him coming out of his dentist\'s door--and, thank God, that\'s the\r\nlast I ever saw of him!\'\r\n\r\nThanks to the nurse\'s quick temper and quaint way of expressing\r\nherself, the object of Henry\'s inquiries was gained already! He\r\nventured on asking if she had noticed the situation of the house. She\r\nhad noticed, and still remembered the situation--did Master Henry\r\nsuppose she had lost the use of her senses, because she happened to be\r\nnigh on eighty years old? The same day, he took the false teeth to the\r\ndentist, and set all further doubt (if doubt had still been possible)\r\nat rest for ever. The teeth had been made for the first Lord Montbarry.\r\n\r\nHenry never revealed the existence of this last link in the chain of\r\ndiscovery to any living creature, his brother Stephen included. He\r\ncarried his terrible secret with him to the grave.\r\n\r\nThere was one other event in the memorable past on which he preserved\r\nthe same compassionate silence. Little Mrs. Ferrari never knew that\r\nher husband had been--not, as she supposed, the Countess\'s victim--but\r\nthe Countess\'s accomplice. She still believed that the late Lord\r\nMontbarry had sent her the thousand-pound note, and still recoiled from\r\nmaking use of a present which she persisted in declaring had \'the stain\r\nof her husband\'s blood on it.\' Agnes, with the widow\'s entire\r\napproval, took the money to the Children\'s Hospital; and spent it in\r\nadding to the number of the beds.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the new year, the marriage took place. At the special\r\nrequest of Agnes, the members of the family were the only persons\r\npresent at the ceremony. There was no wedding breakfast--and the\r\nhoneymoon was spent in the retirement of a cottage on the banks of the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days of the residence of the newly married couple\r\nby the riverside, Lady Montbarry\'s children were invited to enjoy a\r\nday\'s play in the garden. The eldest girl overheard (and reported to\r\nher mother) a little conjugal dialogue which touched on the topic of\r\nThe Haunted Hotel.\r\n\r\n\'Henry, I want you to give me a kiss.\'\r\n\r\n\'There it is, my dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now I am your wife, may I speak to you about something?\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Something that happened the day before we left Venice. You saw the\r\nCountess, during the last hours of her life. Won\'t you tell me whether\r\nshe made any confession to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No conscious confession, Agnes--and therefore no confession that I\r\nneed distress you by repeating.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did she say nothing about what she saw or heard, on that dreadful\r\nnight in my room?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing. We only know that her mind never recovered the terror of it.\'\r\n\r\nAgnes was not quite satisfied. The subject troubled her. Even her own\r\nbrief intercourse with her miserable rival of other days suggested\r\nquestions that perplexed her. She remembered the Countess\'s\r\nprediction. \'You have to bring me to the day of discovery, and to the\r\npunishment that is my doom.\' Had the prediction simply faded, like\r\nother mortal prophecies?--or had it been fulfilled on the terrible\r\nnight when she had seen the apparition, and when she had innocently\r\ntempted the Countess to watch her in her room?\r\n\r\nLet it, however, be recorded, among the other virtues of Mrs. Henry\r\nWestwick, that she never again attempted to persuade her husband into\r\nbetraying his secrets. Other men\'s wives, hearing of this\r\nextraordinary conduct (and being trained in the modern school of morals\r\nand manners), naturally regarded her with compassionate contempt. They\r\nspoke of Agnes, from that time forth, as \'rather an old-fashioned\r\nperson.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that all?\r\n\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r\nIs there no explanation of the mystery of The Haunted Hotel?\r\n\r\nAsk yourself if there is any explanation of the mystery of your own\r\nlife and death.--Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Haunted Hotel, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HAUNTED HOTEL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 170.txt or 170.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/170/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations. To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
