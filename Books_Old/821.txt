Final\r\n PREFACE OF 1848\r\n PREFACE OF 1867\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nDombey and Son\r\n\r\n\r\nDombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by\r\nthe bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead,\r\ncarefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and\r\nclose to it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin,\r\nand it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new.\r\n\r\nDombey was about eight-and-forty years of age. Son about\r\neight-and-forty minutes. Dombey was rather bald, rather red, and though\r\na handsome well-made man, too stern and pompous in appearance, to be\r\nprepossessing. Son was very bald, and very red, and though (of course)\r\nan undeniably fine infant, somewhat crushed and spotty in his general\r\neffect, as yet. On the brow of Dombey, Time and his brother Care had\r\nset some marks, as on a tree that was to come down in good\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94remorseless twins they are for striding through their human\r\nforests, notching as they go\xe2\x80\x94while the countenance of Son was crossed\r\nwith a thousand little creases, which the same deceitful Time would\r\ntake delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of\r\nhis scythe, as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations.\r\n\r\nDombey, exulting in the long-looked-for event, jingled and jingled the\r\nheavy gold watch-chain that depended from below his trim blue coat,\r\nwhereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the\r\ndistant fire. Son, with his little fists curled up and clenched,\r\nseemed, in his feeble way, to be squaring at existence for having come\r\nupon him so unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe House will once again, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cbe not only\r\nin name but in fact Dombey and Son;\xe2\x80\x9d and he added, in a tone of\r\nluxurious satisfaction, with his eyes half-closed as if he were reading\r\nthe name in a device of flowers, and inhaling their fragrance at the\r\nsame time; \xe2\x80\x9cDom-bey and Son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words had such a softening influence, that he appended a term of\r\nendearment to Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s name (though not without some hesitation, as\r\nbeing a man but little used to that form of address): and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs\r\nDombey, my\xe2\x80\x94my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA transient flush of faint surprise overspread the sick lady\xe2\x80\x99s face as\r\nshe raised her eyes towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be christened Paul, my\xe2\x80\x94Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x94of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe feebly echoed, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d or rather expressed it by the motion of\r\nher lips, and closed her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father\xe2\x80\x99s name, Mrs Dombey, and his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s! I wish his\r\ngrandfather were alive this day! There is some inconvenience in the\r\nnecessity of writing Junior,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, making a fictitious\r\nautograph on his knee; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is merely of a private and personal\r\ncomplexion. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enter into the correspondence of the House. Its\r\nsignature remains the same.\xe2\x80\x9d And again he said \xe2\x80\x9cDombey and Son,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nexactly the same tone as before.\r\n\r\nThose three words conveyed the one idea of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s life. The earth\r\nwas made for Dombey and Son to trade in, and the sun and moon were made\r\nto give them light. Rivers and seas were formed to float their ships;\r\nrainbows gave them promise of fair weather; winds blew for or against\r\ntheir enterprises; stars and planets circled in their orbits, to\r\npreserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre. Common\r\nabbreviations took new meanings in his eyes, and had sole reference to\r\nthem. A. D. had no concern with Anno Domini, but stood for anno\r\nDombei\xe2\x80\x94and Son.\r\n\r\nHe had risen, as his father had before him, in the course of life and\r\ndeath, from Son to Dombey, and for nearly twenty years had been the\r\nsole representative of the Firm. Of those years he had been married,\r\nten\xe2\x80\x94married, as some said, to a lady with no heart to give him; whose\r\nhappiness was in the past, and who was content to bind her broken\r\nspirit to the dutiful and meek endurance of the present. Such idle talk\r\nwas little likely to reach the ears of Mr Dombey, whom it nearly\r\nconcerned; and probably no one in the world would have received it with\r\nsuch utter incredulity as he, if it had reached him. Dombey and Son had\r\noften dealt in hides, but never in hearts. They left that fancy ware to\r\nboys and girls, and boarding-schools and books. Mr Dombey would have\r\nreasoned: That a matrimonial alliance with himself _must_, in the\r\nnature of things, be gratifying and honourable to any woman of common\r\nsense. That the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a House,\r\ncould not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast\r\nof the least ambitious of her sex. That Mrs Dombey had entered on that\r\nsocial contract of matrimony: almost necessarily part of a genteel and\r\nwealthy station, even without reference to the perpetuation of family\r\nFirms: with her eyes fully open to these advantages. That Mrs Dombey\r\nhad had daily practical knowledge of his position in society. That Mrs\r\nDombey had always sat at the head of his table, and done the honours of\r\nhis house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner. That Mrs\r\nDombey must have been happy. That she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\nOr, at all events, with one drawback. Yes. That he would have allowed.\r\nWith only one; but that one certainly involving much. With the drawback\r\nof hope deferred. That hope deferred, which, (as the Scripture very\r\ncorrectly tells us, Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way;\r\nfor his highest distinct idea even of Scripture, if examined, would\r\nhave been found to be; that as forming part of a general whole, of\r\nwhich Dombey and Son formed another part, it was therefore to be\r\ncommended and upheld) maketh the heart sick. They had been married ten\r\nyears, and until this present day on which Mr Dombey sat jingling and\r\njingling his heavy gold watch-chain in the great arm-chair by the side\r\nof the bed, had had no issue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To speak of; none worth mentioning. There had been a girl some six\r\nyears before, and the child, who had stolen into the chamber\r\nunobserved, was now crouching timidly, in a corner whence she could see\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s face. But what was a girl to Dombey and Son! In the\r\ncapital of the House\xe2\x80\x99s name and dignity, such a child was merely a\r\npiece of base coin that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be invested\xe2\x80\x94a bad Boy\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s cup of satisfaction was so full at this moment, however,\r\nthat he felt he could afford a drop or two of its contents, even to\r\nsprinkle on the dust in the by-path of his little daughter.\r\n\r\nSo he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, you may go and look at your pretty brother, if\r\nyou like, I daresay. Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child glanced keenly at the blue coat and stiff white cravat,\r\nwhich, with a pair of creaking boots and a very loud ticking watch,\r\nembodied her idea of a father; but her eyes returned to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface immediately, and she neither moved nor answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer insensibility is as proof against a brother as against every thing\r\nelse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey to himself He seemed so confirmed in a previous\r\nopinion by the discovery, as to be quite glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext moment, the lady had opened her eyes and seen the child; and the\r\nchild had run towards her; and, standing on tiptoe, the better to hide\r\nher face in her embrace, had clung about her with a desperate affection\r\nvery much at variance with her years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, rising testily. \xe2\x80\x9cA very ill-advised\r\nand feverish proceeding this, I am sure. Please to ring there for Miss\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x99s nurse. Really the person should be more care-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait! I\xe2\x80\x94had better ask Doctor Peps if he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the goodness to step\r\nupstairs again perhaps. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, pausing for a moment at the settee before the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cto take\r\nparticular care of this young gentleman, Mrs \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockitt, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the nurse, a simpering piece of faded\r\ngentility, who did not presume to state her name as a fact, but merely\r\noffered it as a mild suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf this young gentleman, Mrs Blockitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir, indeed. I remember when Miss Florence was born\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, bending over the basket bedstead, and\r\nslightly bending his brows at the same time. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence was all\r\nvery well, but this is another matter. This young gentleman has to\r\naccomplish a destiny. A destiny, little fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d As he thus\r\napostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips, and\r\nkissed it; then, seeming to fear that the action involved some\r\ncompromise of his dignity, went, awkwardly enough, away.\r\n\r\nDoctor Parker Peps, one of the Court Physicians, and a man of immense\r\nreputation for assisting at the increase of great families, was walking\r\nup and down the drawing-room with his hands behind him, to the\r\nunspeakable admiration of the family Surgeon, who had regularly puffed\r\nthe case for the last six weeks, among all his patients, friends, and\r\nacquaintances, as one to which he was in hourly expectation day and\r\nnight of being summoned, in conjunction with Doctor Parker Pep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Parker Peps in a round, deep, sonorous voice,\r\nmuffled for the occasion, like the knocker; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you find that your dear\r\nlady is at all roused by your visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStimulated as it were?\xe2\x80\x9d said the family practitioner faintly: bowing\r\nat the same time to the Doctor, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my putting\r\nin a word, but this is a valuable connexion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was quite discomfited by the question. He had thought so\r\nlittle of the patient, that he was not in a condition to answer it. He\r\nsaid that it would be a satisfaction to him, if Doctor Parker Peps\r\nwould walk upstairs again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! We must not disguise from you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Parker Peps,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a want of power in Her Grace the Duchess\xe2\x80\x94I beg your\r\npardon; I confound names; I should say, in your amiable lady. That\r\nthere is a certain degree of languor, and a general absence of\r\nelasticity, which we would rather\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the family practitioner with another inclination of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Parker Peps, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich we would rather not see. It\r\nwould appear that the system of Lady Cankaby\xe2\x80\x94excuse me: I should say of\r\nMrs Dombey: I confuse the names of cases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo very numerous,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the family practitioner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t be expected\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure\xe2\x80\x94quite wonderful if otherwise\xe2\x80\x94Doctor Parker Peps\xe2\x80\x99s West-End\r\npractice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cquite so. It would appear, I was\r\nobserving, that the system of our patient has sustained a shock, from\r\nwhich it can only hope to rally by a great and strong\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd vigorous,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the family practitioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the Doctor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand vigorous effort. Mr Pilkins here,\r\nwho from his position of medical adviser in this family\xe2\x80\x94no one better\r\nqualified to fill that position, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the family practitioner. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Praise from Sir Hubert\r\nStanley!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Doctor Parker Peps, \xe2\x80\x9cto say so. Mr\r\nPilkins who, from his position, is best acquainted with the patient\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstitution in its normal state (an acquaintance very valuable to us\r\nin forming our opinions in these occasions), is of opinion, with me,\r\nthat Nature must be called upon to make a vigorous effort in this\r\ninstance; and that if our interesting friend the Countess of Dombey\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_beg_ your pardon; Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x94should not be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAble,\xe2\x80\x9d said the family practitioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Parker Peps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat effort,\xe2\x80\x9d said the family practitioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccessfully,\xe2\x80\x9d said they both together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d added Doctor Parker Peps, alone and very gravely, \xe2\x80\x9ca crisis\r\nmight arise, which we should both sincerely deplore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, they stood for a few seconds looking at the ground. Then, on\r\nthe motion\xe2\x80\x94made in dumb show\xe2\x80\x94of Doctor Parker Peps, they went upstairs;\r\nthe family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished\r\nprofessional, and following him out, with most obsequious politeness.\r\n\r\nTo record of Mr Dombey that he was not in his way affected by this\r\nintelligence, would be to do him an injustice. He was not a man of whom\r\nit could properly be said that he was ever startled, or shocked; but he\r\ncertainly had a sense within him, that if his wife should sicken and\r\ndecay, he would be very sorry, and that he would find a something gone\r\nfrom among his plate and furniture, and other household possessions,\r\nwhich was well worth the having, and could not be lost without sincere\r\nregret. Though it would be a cool, business-like, gentlemanly,\r\nself-possessed regret, no doubt.\r\n\r\nHis meditations on the subject were soon interrupted, first by the\r\nrustling of garments on the staircase, and then by the sudden whisking\r\ninto the room of a lady rather past the middle age than otherwise but\r\ndressed in a very juvenile manner, particularly as to the tightness of\r\nher bodice, who, running up to him with a kind of screw in her face and\r\ncarriage, expressive of suppressed emotion, flung her arms around his\r\nneck, and said, in a choking voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul! He\xe2\x80\x99s quite a Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d returned her brother\xe2\x80\x94for Mr Dombey was her brother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink he is like the family. Don\xe2\x80\x99t agitate yourself, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very foolish of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, sitting down, and taking out\r\nher pocket-handkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s such a perfect Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa; smiling through her tears, which\r\nindeed were not overpowering, \xe2\x80\x9cas to be perfectly ridiculous. So\r\ncompletely our family. _I_ never saw anything like it in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this about Fanny, herself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is\r\nFanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Louisa, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing whatever. Take my word,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing whatever. There is exhaustion, certainly, but nothing like\r\nwhat I underwent myself, either with George or Frederick. An effort is\r\nnecessary. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. If dear Fanny were a Dombey!\xe2\x80\x94But I daresay\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it; I have no doubt she\xe2\x80\x99ll make it. Knowing it to be\r\nrequired of her, as a duty, of course she\xe2\x80\x99ll make it. My dear Paul,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very weak and silly of me, I know, to be so trembly and shaky from\r\nhead to foot; but I am so very queer that I must ask you for a glass of\r\nwine and a morsel of that cake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey promptly supplied her with these refreshments from a tray on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not drink my love to you, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall drink\r\nto the little Dombey. Good gracious me!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the most astonishing thing\r\nI ever knew in all my days, he\xe2\x80\x99s such a perfect Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuenching this expression of opinion in a short hysterical laugh which\r\nterminated in tears, Louisa cast up her eyes, and emptied her glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s very weak and silly of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cto be so\r\ntrembly and shaky from head to foot, and to allow my feelings so\r\ncompletely to get the better of me, but I cannot help it. I thought I\r\nshould have fallen out of the staircase window as I came down from\r\nseeing dear Fanny, and that tiddy ickle sing.\xe2\x80\x9d These last words\r\noriginated in a sudden vivid reminiscence of the baby.\r\n\r\nThey were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Chick,\xe2\x80\x9d said a very bland female voice outside, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you now,\r\nmy dear friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa in a low voice, as she rose from her seat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Tox. The kindest creature! I never could have got here\r\nwithout her! Miss Tox, my brother Mr Dombey. Paul, my dear, my very\r\nparticular friend Miss Tox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady thus specially presented, was a long lean figure, wearing such\r\na faded air that she seemed not to have been made in what linen-drapers\r\ncall \xe2\x80\x9cfast colours\xe2\x80\x9d originally, and to have, by little and little,\r\nwashed out. But for this she might have been described as the very pink\r\nof general propitiation and politeness. From a long habit of listening\r\nadmiringly to everything that was said in her presence, and looking at\r\nthe speakers as if she were mentally engaged in taking off impressions\r\nof their images upon her soul, never to part with the same but with\r\nlife, her head had quite settled on one side. Her hands had contracted\r\na spasmodic habit of raising themselves of their own accord as in\r\ninvoluntary admiration. Her eyes were liable to a similar affection.\r\nShe had the softest voice that ever was heard; and her nose,\r\nstupendously aquiline, had a little knob in the very centre or\r\nkey-stone of the bridge, whence it tended downwards towards her face,\r\nas in an invincible determination never to turn up at anything.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s dress, though perfectly genteel and good, had a certain\r\ncharacter of angularity and scantiness. She was accustomed to wear odd\r\nweedy little flowers in her bonnets and caps. Strange grasses were\r\nsometimes perceived in her hair; and it was observed by the curious, of\r\nall her collars, frills, tuckers, wristbands, and other gossamer\r\narticles\xe2\x80\x94indeed of everything she wore which had two ends to it\r\nintended to unite\xe2\x80\x94that the two ends were never on good terms, and\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite meet without a struggle. She had furry articles for\r\nwinter wear, as tippets, boas, and muffs, which stood up on end in\r\nrampant manner, and were not at all sleek. She was much given to the\r\ncarrying about of small bags with snaps to them, that went off like\r\nlittle pistols when they were shut up; and when full-dressed, she wore\r\nround her neck the barrenest of lockets, representing a fishy old eye,\r\nwith no approach to speculation in it. These and other appearances of a\r\nsimilar nature, had served to propagate the opinion, that Miss Tox was\r\na lady of what is called a limited independence, which she turned to\r\nthe best account. Possibly her mincing gait encouraged the belief, and\r\nsuggested that her clipping a step of ordinary compass into two or\r\nthree, originated in her habit of making the most of everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, with a prodigious curtsey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat to have\r\nthe honour of being presented to Mr Dombey is a distinction which I\r\nhave long sought, but very little expected at the present moment. My\r\ndear Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x94may I say Louisa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick took Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers, rested the foot of her\r\nwine-glass upon it, repressed a tear, and said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nbless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cmy sweet friend, how are you\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Chick returned. \xe2\x80\x9cTake some wine. You have been almost as\r\nanxious as I have been, and must want it, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey of course officiated, and also refilled his sister\xe2\x80\x99s glass,\r\nwhich she (looking another way, and unconscious of his intention) held\r\nstraight and steady the while, and then regarded with great\r\nastonishment, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul, what have you been doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Chick, still retaining her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\r\nhow much I have been interested in the anticipation of the event of\r\ntoday, and how trembly and shaky I have been from head to foot in\r\nexpectation of it, has been working at a little gift for Fanny, which I\r\npromised to present. Miss Tox is ingenuity itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a pincushion for the toilette table, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed his\r\nsister; \xe2\x80\x9cone of those trifles which are insignificant to your sex in\r\ngeneral, as it\xe2\x80\x99s very natural they should be\xe2\x80\x94we have no business to\r\nexpect they should be otherwise\xe2\x80\x94but to which we attach some interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I do say, and will say, and must say,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued his sister,\r\npressing the foot of the wine-glass on Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s hand, at each of the\r\nthree clauses, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Tox has very prettily adapted the sentiment\r\nto the occasion. I call \xe2\x80\x98Welcome little Dombey\xe2\x80\x99 Poetry, myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the device?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the device,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do me the justice to remember, my dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox in a\r\ntone of low and earnest entreaty, \xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing but the\xe2\x80\x94I have some\r\ndifficulty in expressing myself\xe2\x80\x94the dubiousness of the result would\r\nhave induced me to take so great a liberty: \xe2\x80\x98Welcome, Master Dombey,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwould have been much more congenial to my feelings, as I am sure you\r\nknow. But the uncertainty attendant on angelic strangers, will, I hope,\r\nexcuse what must otherwise appear an unwarrantable familiarity.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nTox made a graceful bend as she spoke, in favour of Mr Dombey, which\r\nthat gentleman graciously acknowledged. Even the sort of recognition of\r\nDombey and Son, conveyed in the foregoing conversation, was so\r\npalatable to him, that his sister, Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x94though he affected to\r\nconsider her a weak good-natured person\xe2\x80\x94had perhaps more influence over\r\nhim than anybody else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d that lady broke out afresh, after silently\r\ncontemplating his features for a few moments, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to\r\nlaugh or cry when I look at you, I declare, you do so remind me of that\r\ndear baby upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with a sweet smile, \xe2\x80\x9cafter this, I forgive\r\nFanny everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a declaration in a Christian spirit, and Mrs Chick felt that it\r\ndid her good. Not that she had anything particular to forgive in her\r\nsister-in-law, nor indeed anything at all, except her having married\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x94in itself a species of audacity\xe2\x80\x94and her having, in the\r\ncourse of events, given birth to a girl instead of a boy: which, as Mrs\r\nChick had frequently observed, was not quite what she had expected of\r\nher, and was not a pleasant return for all the attention and\r\ndistinction she had met with.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey being hastily summoned out of the room at this moment, the\r\ntwo ladies were left alone together. Miss Tox immediately became\r\nspasmodic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would admire my brother. I told you so beforehand, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa. Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s hands and eyes expressed how much. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nas to his property, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, with deep feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIm-mense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut his deportment, my dear Louisa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cHis presence! His\r\ndignity! No portrait that I have ever seen of anyone has been half so\r\nreplete with those qualities. Something so stately, you know: so\r\nuncompromising: so very wide across the chest: so upright! A pecuniary\r\nDuke of York, my love, and nothing short of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat _I_ should designate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear Paul!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his sister, as he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look\r\nquite pale! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say, Louisa, that they tell me that Fanny\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his sister rising, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Do\r\nnot allow yourself to receive a turn unnecessarily. Remember of what\r\nimportance you are to society, and do not allow yourself to be worried\r\nby what is so very inconsiderately told you by people who ought to know\r\nbetter. Really I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I know, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, stiffly, \xe2\x80\x9chow to bear myself\r\nbefore the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody better, my dear Paul. Nobody half so well. They would be\r\nignorant and base indeed who doubted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnorant and base indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Miss Tox softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Louisa, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have any reliance on my experience,\r\nPaul, you may rest assured that there is nothing wanting but an effort\r\non Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s part. And that effort,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, taking off her\r\nbonnet, and adjusting her cap and gloves, in a business-like manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe must be encouraged, and really, if necessary, urged to make. Now,\r\nmy dear Paul, come upstairs with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, who, besides being generally influenced by his sister for\r\nthe reason already mentioned, had really faith in her as an experienced\r\nand bustling matron, acquiesced; and followed her, at once, to the sick\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe lady lay upon her bed as he had left her, clasping her little\r\ndaughter to her breast. The child clung close about her, with the same\r\nintensity as before, and never raised her head, or moved her soft cheek\r\nfrom her mother\xe2\x80\x99s face, or looked on those who stood around, or spoke,\r\nor moved, or shed a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRestless without the little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor whispered Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nfound it best to have her in again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan nothing be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can do no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe windows stood open, and the twilight was gathering without.\r\n\r\nThe scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the\r\nroom, but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady\r\nbreathed.\r\n\r\nThere was such a solemn stillness round the bed; and the two medical\r\nattendants seemed to look on the impassive form with so much compassion\r\nand so little hope, that Mrs Chick was for the moment diverted from her\r\npurpose. But presently summoning courage, and what she called presence\r\nof mind, she sat down by the bedside, and said in the low precise tone\r\nof one who endeavours to awaken a sleeper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny! Fanny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no sound in answer but the loud ticking of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s watch\r\nand Doctor Parker Peps\xe2\x80\x99s watch, which seemed in the silence to be\r\nrunning a race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with assumed lightness, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr\r\nDombey come to see you. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to him? They want to lay your\r\nlittle boy\xe2\x80\x94the baby, Fanny, you know; you have hardly seen him yet, I\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94in bed; but they can\xe2\x80\x99t till you rouse yourself a little. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think it\xe2\x80\x99s time you roused yourself a little? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her ear to the bed, and listened: at the same time looking\r\nround at the bystanders, and holding up her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was it you said, Fanny? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo word or sound in answer. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s watch and Dr Parker Peps\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwatch seemed to be racing faster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, really, Fanny my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sister-in-law, altering her\r\nposition, and speaking less confidently, and more earnestly, in spite\r\nof herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to be quite cross with you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrouse yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for you to make an effort, and perhaps a\r\nvery great and painful effort which you are not disposed to make; but\r\nthis is a world of effort you know, Fanny, and we must never yield,\r\nwhen so much depends upon us. Come! Try! I must really scold you if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe race in the ensuing pause was fierce and furious. The watches\r\nseemed to jostle, and to trip each other up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny!\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, glancing round, with a gathering alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nlook at me. Only open your eyes to show me that you hear and understand\r\nme; will you? Good Heaven, gentlemen, what is to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed; and the\r\nPhysician, stooping down, whispered in the child\xe2\x80\x99s ear. Not having\r\nunderstood the purport of his whisper, the little creature turned her\r\nperfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him; but without\r\nloosening her hold in the least.\r\n\r\nThe whisper was repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\nThe little voice, familiar and dearly loved, awakened some show of\r\nconsciousness, even at that ebb. For a moment, the closed eye lids\r\ntrembled, and the nostril quivered, and the faintest shadow of a smile\r\nwas seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the child sobbing aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear Mama! oh dear Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child, aside\r\nfrom the face and mouth of the mother. Alas how calm they lay there;\r\nhow little breath there was to stir them!\r\n\r\nThus, clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms, the mother\r\ndrifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nIn which Timely Provision is made for an Emergency that will sometimes\r\narise in the best-regulated Families.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall never cease to congratulate myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick,\xe2\x80\x9d on having\r\nsaid, when I little thought what was in store for us,\xe2\x80\x94really as if I\r\nwas inspired by something,\xe2\x80\x94that I forgave poor dear Fanny everything.\r\nWhatever happens, that must always be a comfort to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick made this impressive observation in the drawing-room, after\r\nhaving descended thither from the inspection of the mantua-makers\r\nupstairs, who were busy on the family mourning. She delivered it for\r\nthe behoof of Mr Chick, who was a stout bald gentleman, with a very\r\nlarge face, and his hands continually in his pockets, and who had a\r\ntendency in his nature to whistle and hum tunes, which, sensible of the\r\nindecorum of such sounds in a house of grief, he was at some pains to\r\nrepress at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you over-exert yourself, Loo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\xe2\x80\x99ll be laid\r\nup with spasms, I see. Right tol loor rul! Bless my soul, I forgot!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re here one day and gone the next!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick contented herself with a glance of reproof, and then\r\nproceeded with the thread of her discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope this heart-rending occurrence will be a\r\nwarning to all of us, to accustom ourselves to rouse ourselves, and to\r\nmake efforts in time where they\xe2\x80\x99re required of us. There\xe2\x80\x99s a moral in\r\neverything, if we would only avail ourselves of it. It will be our own\r\nfaults if we lose sight of this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Chick invaded the grave silence which ensued on this remark with the\r\nsingularly inappropriate air of \xe2\x80\x9cA cobbler there was;\xe2\x80\x9d and checking\r\nhimself, in some confusion, observed, that it was undoubtedly our own\r\nfaults if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t improve such melancholy occasions as the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich might be better improved, I should think, Mr C.,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted his\r\nhelpmate, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthan by the introduction, either of the\r\ncollege hornpipe, or the equally unmeaning and unfeeling remark of\r\nrump-te-iddity, bow-wow-wow!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which Mr Chick had indeed indulged in,\r\nunder his breath, and which Mrs Chick repeated in a tone of withering\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely habit, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mr Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Habit!\xe2\x80\x9d returned his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a rational being,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make such ridiculous excuses. Habit! If I was to get a habit (as\r\nyou call it) of walking on the ceiling, like the flies, I should hear\r\nenough of it, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared so probable that such a habit might be attended with some\r\ndegree of notoriety, that Mr Chick didn\xe2\x80\x99t venture to dispute the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBow-wow-wow!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Chick with an emphasis of blighting\r\ncontempt on the last syllable. \xe2\x80\x9cMore like a professional singer with\r\nthe hydrophobia, than a man in your station of life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the Baby, Loo?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Chick: to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Baby do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor bereaved little baby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any\r\nother, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cMore shame for you,\r\nI was going to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Chick looked astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure the morning I have had, with that dining-room downstairs,\r\none mass of babies, no one in their senses would believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne mass of babies!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Chick, staring with an alarmed\r\nexpression about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have occurred to most men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat poor dear\r\nFanny being no more,\xe2\x80\x94those words of mine will always be a balm and\r\ncomfort to me,\xe2\x80\x9d here she dried her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cit becomes necessary to\r\nprovide a Nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cToor-ru!\xe2\x80\x94such is life, I mean. I hope you are\r\nsuited, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick; \xe2\x80\x9cnor likely to be, so far as I can\r\nsee, and in the meantime the poor child seems likely to be starved to\r\ndeath. Paul is so very particular\xe2\x80\x94naturally so, of course, having set\r\nhis whole heart on this one boy\xe2\x80\x94and there are so many objections to\r\neverybody that offers, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see, myself, the least chance of an\r\narrangement. Meanwhile, of course, the child is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to the Devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cto be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdmonished, however, that he had committed himself, by the indignation\r\nexpressed in Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x99s countenance at the idea of a Dombey going\r\nthere; and thinking to atone for his misconduct by a bright suggestion,\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t something temporary be done with a teapot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had meant to bring the subject prematurely to a close, he could\r\nnot have done it more effectually. After looking at him for some\r\nmoments in silent resignation, Mrs Chick said she trusted he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsaid it in aggravation, because that would do very little honour to his\r\nheart. She trusted he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said it seriously, because that would do\r\nvery little honour to his head. As in any case, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, however\r\nsanguine his disposition, hope to offer a remark that would be a\r\ngreater outrage on human nature in general, we would beg to leave the\r\ndiscussion at that point.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick then walked majestically to the window and peeped through the\r\nblind, attracted by the sound of wheels. Mr Chick, finding that his\r\ndestiny was, for the time, against him, said no more, and walked off.\r\nBut it was not always thus with Mr Chick. He was often in the ascendant\r\nhimself, and at those times punished Louisa roundly. In their\r\nmatrimonial bickerings they were, upon the whole, a well-matched,\r\nfairly-balanced, give-and-take couple. It would have been, generally\r\nspeaking, very difficult to have betted on the winner. Often when Mr\r\nChick seemed beaten, he would suddenly make a start, turn the tables,\r\nclatter them about the ears of Mrs Chick, and carry all before him.\r\nBeing liable himself to similar unlooked for checks from Mrs Chick,\r\ntheir little contests usually possessed a character of uncertainty that\r\nwas very animating.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to, and came\r\nrunning into the room in a breathless condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cis the vacancy still unsupplied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou good soul, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope and believe\xe2\x80\x94but in\r\none moment, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRunning downstairs again as fast as she had run up, Miss Tox got the\r\nparty out of the hackney-coach, and soon returned with it under convoy.\r\n\r\nIt then appeared that she had used the word, not in its legal or\r\nbusiness acceptation, when it merely expresses an individual, but as a\r\nnoun of multitude, or signifying many: for Miss Tox escorted a plump\r\nrosy-cheeked wholesome apple-faced young woman, with an infant in her\r\narms; a younger woman not so plump, but apple-faced also, who led a\r\nplump and apple-faced child in each hand; another plump and also\r\napple-faced boy who walked by himself; and finally, a plump and\r\napple-faced man, who carried in his arms another plump and apple-faced\r\nboy, whom he stood down on the floor, and admonished, in a husky\r\nwhisper, to \xe2\x80\x9ckitch hold of his brother Johnny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cknowing your great anxiety, and\r\nwishing to relieve it, I posted off myself to the Queen Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRoyal Married Females,\xe2\x80\x9d which you had forgot, and put the question, Was\r\nthere anybody there that they thought would suit? No, they said there\r\nwas not. When they gave me that answer, I do assure you, my dear, I was\r\nalmost driven to despair on your account. But it did so happen, that\r\none of the Royal Married Females, hearing the inquiry, reminded the\r\nmatron of another who had gone to her own home, and who, she said,\r\nwould in all likelihood be most satisfactory. The moment I heard this,\r\nand had it corroborated by the matron\xe2\x80\x94excellent references and\r\nunimpeachable character\xe2\x80\x94I got the address, my dear, and posted off\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the dear good Tox, you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so. Arriving at the house\r\n(the cleanest place, my dear! You might eat your dinner off the floor),\r\nI found the whole family sitting at table; and feeling that no account\r\nof them could be half so comfortable to you and Mr Dombey as the sight\r\nof them all together, I brought them all away. This gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Tox, pointing out the apple-faced man, \xe2\x80\x9cis the father. Will you\r\nhave the goodness to come a little forward, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apple-faced man having sheepishly complied with this request, stood\r\nchuckling and grinning in a front row.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is his wife, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, singling out the young\r\nwoman with the baby. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Polly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty well, I thank you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\nBy way of bringing her out dexterously, Miss Tox had made the inquiry\r\nas in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen for a\r\nfortnight or so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other young woman is her\r\nunmarried sister who lives with them, and would take care of her\r\nchildren. Her name\xe2\x80\x99s Jemima. How do you do, Jemima?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty well, I thank you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Jemima.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad indeed to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep\r\nso. Five children. Youngest six weeks. The fine little boy with the\r\nblister on his nose is the eldest. The blister, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nTox, looking round upon the family, \xe2\x80\x9cis not constitutional, but\r\naccidental?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apple-faced man was understood to growl, \xe2\x80\x9cFlat iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlat iron,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! quite true. I forgot. The little\r\ncreature, in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s absence, smelt a warm flat iron. You\xe2\x80\x99re quite\r\nright, Sir. You were going to have the goodness to inform me, when we\r\narrived at the door that you were by trade a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStoker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA choker!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, quite aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStoker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cSteam ingine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-h! Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox, looking thoughtfully at him, and\r\nseeming still to have but a very imperfect understanding of his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you like it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich, Mum?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cYour trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Pretty well, Mum. The ashes sometimes gets in here;\xe2\x80\x9d touching his\r\nchest: \xe2\x80\x9cand makes a man speak gruff, as at the present time. But it is\r\nashes, Mum, not crustiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox seemed to be so little enlightened by this reply, as to find a\r\ndifficulty in pursuing the subject. But Mrs Chick relieved her, by\r\nentering into a close private examination of Polly, her children, her\r\nmarriage certificate, testimonials, and so forth. Polly coming out\r\nunscathed from this ordeal, Mrs Chick withdrew with her report to her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and as an emphatic comment on it, and corroboration of\r\nit, carried the two rosiest little Toodles with her. Toodle being the\r\nfamily name of the apple-faced family.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey had remained in his own apartment since the death of his\r\nwife, absorbed in visions of the youth, education, and destination of\r\nhis baby son. Something lay at the bottom of his cool heart, colder and\r\nheavier than its ordinary load; but it was more a sense of the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloss than his own, awakening within him an almost angry sorrow. That\r\nthe life and progress on which he built such hopes, should be\r\nendangered in the outset by so mean a want; that Dombey and Son should\r\nbe tottering for a nurse, was a sore humiliation. And yet in his pride\r\nand jealousy, he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being\r\ndependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s desire, on a hired serving-woman who would be to the child, for\r\nthe time, all that even his alliance could have made his own wife, that\r\nin every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure. The\r\ntime had now come, however, when he could no longer be divided between\r\nthese two sets of feelings. The less so, as there seemed to be no flaw\r\nin the title of Polly Toodle after his sister had set it forth, with\r\nmany commendations on the indefatigable friendship of Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese children look healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my God, to think of\r\ntheir some day claiming a sort of relationship to Paul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what relationship is there!\xe2\x80\x9d Louisa began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr Dombey, who had not intended his sister to\r\nparticipate in the thought he had unconsciously expressed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there,\r\ndid you say, Louisa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan there be, I mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy none,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole world knows that, I\r\npresume. Grief has not made me idiotic, Louisa. Take them away, Louisa!\r\nLet me see this woman and her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick bore off the tender pair of Toodles, and presently returned\r\nwith that tougher couple whose presence her brother had commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, turning round in his easy chair, as\r\none piece, and not as a man with limbs and joints, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you\r\nare poor, and wish to earn money by nursing the little boy, my son, who\r\nhas been so prematurely deprived of what can never be replaced. I have\r\nno objection to your adding to the comforts of your family by that\r\nmeans. So far as I can tell, you seem to be a deserving object. But I\r\nmust impose one or two conditions on you, before you enter my house in\r\nthat capacity. While you are here, I must stipulate that you are always\r\nknown as\xe2\x80\x94say as Richards\xe2\x80\x94an ordinary name, and convenient. Have you any\r\nobjection to be known as Richards? You had better consult your\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, after a pretty long pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your\r\nhusband say to your being called Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the husband did nothing but chuckle and grin, and continually draw\r\nhis right hand across his mouth, moistening the palm, Mrs Toodle, after\r\nnudging him twice or thrice in vain, dropped a curtsey and replied\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat perhaps if she was to be called out of her name, it would be\r\nconsidered in the wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cI desire to make it a question of\r\nwages, altogether. Now, Richards, if you nurse my bereaved child, I\r\nwish you to remember this always. You will receive a liberal stipend in\r\nreturn for the discharge of certain duties, in the performance of\r\nwhich, I wish you to see as little of your family as possible. When\r\nthose duties cease to be required and rendered, and the stipend ceases\r\nto be paid, there is an end of all relations between us. Do you\r\nunderstand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toodle seemed doubtful about it; and as to Toodle himself, he had\r\nevidently no doubt whatever, that he was all abroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have children of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all in\r\nthis bargain that you need become attached to my child, or that my\r\nchild need become attached to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect or desire anything of\r\nthe kind. Quite the reverse. When you go away from here, you will have\r\nconcluded what is a mere matter of bargain and sale, hiring and\r\nletting: and will stay away. The child will cease to remember you; and\r\nyou will cease, if you please, to remember the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toodle, with a little more colour in her cheeks than she had had\r\nbefore, said \xe2\x80\x9cshe hoped she knew her place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you do, Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you know it\r\nvery well. Indeed it is so plain and obvious that it could hardly be\r\notherwise. Louisa, my dear, arrange with Richards about money, and let\r\nher have it when and how she pleases. Mr what\xe2\x80\x99s-your name, a word with\r\nyou, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus arrested on the threshold as he was following his wife out of the\r\nroom, Toodle returned and confronted Mr Dombey alone. He was a strong,\r\nloose, round-shouldered, shuffling, shaggy fellow, on whom his clothes\r\nsat negligently: with a good deal of hair and whisker, deepened in its\r\nnatural tint, perhaps by smoke and coal-dust: hard knotty hands: and a\r\nsquare forehead, as coarse in grain as the bark of an oak. A thorough\r\ncontrast in all respects, to Mr Dombey, who was one of those\r\nclose-shaved close-cut moneyed gentlemen who are glossy and crisp like\r\nnew bank-notes, and who seem to be artificially braced and tightened as\r\nby the stimulating action of golden showerbaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a son, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour on \xe2\x80\x99em, Sir. Four hims and a her. All alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s as much as you can afford to keep them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly afford but one thing in the world less, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo lose \xe2\x80\x99em, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, not partickk\xe2\x80\x99ller, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith chalk, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could make shift to chalk a little bit, I think, if I was put to\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle after some reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are two or three and thirty, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThereabouts, I suppose, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Toodle, after more reflection\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t you learn?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m a going to, Sir. One of my little boys is a going to learn me,\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s old enough, and been to school himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, after looking at him attentively, and with no\r\ngreat favour, as he stood gazing round the room (principally round the\r\nceiling) and still drawing his hand across and across his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nheard what I said to your wife just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly heerd it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, jerking his hat over his shoulder in the\r\ndirection of the door, with an air of perfect confidence in his better\r\nhalf. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ask you if you heard it. You did, I suppose, and understood it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heerd it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I understood it rightly\r\nSir, \xe2\x80\x9caccount of being no scholar, and the words being\xe2\x80\x94ask your\r\npardon\xe2\x80\x94rayther high. But Polly heerd it. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you appear to leave everything to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, frustrated\r\nin his intention of impressing his views still more distinctly on the\r\nhusband, as the stronger character, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is of no use my\r\nsaying anything to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cPolly heerd it. She\xe2\x80\x99s awake, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you any longer then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, disappointed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you worked all your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMostly underground, Sir, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I got married. I come to the level\r\nthen. I\xe2\x80\x99m a going on one of these here railroads when they comes into\r\nfull play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he added in one of his hoarse whispers, \xe2\x80\x9cWe means to bring up little\r\nBiler to that line,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey inquired haughtily who little Biler was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eldest on \xe2\x80\x99em, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t a common\r\nname. Sermuchser that when he was took to church the gen\xe2\x80\x99lm\xe2\x80\x99n said, it\r\nwamm\xe2\x80\x99t a chris\xe2\x80\x99en one, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give it. But we always calls him\r\nBiler just the same. For we don\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm. Not we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say, Man,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Dombey; looking at him with\r\nmarked displeasure, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have called a child after a boiler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Toodle, with a tender consideration for his\r\nmistake. \xe2\x80\x9cI should hope not! No, Sir. Arter a BILER Sir. The\r\nSteamingine was a\xe2\x80\x99most as good as a godfather to him, and so we called\r\nhim Biler, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the last straw breaks the laden camel\xe2\x80\x99s back, this piece of\r\ninformation crushed the sinking spirits of Mr Dombey. He motioned his\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s foster-father to the door, who departed by no means\r\nunwillingly: and then turning the key, paced up and down the room in\r\nsolitary wretchedness.\r\n\r\nIt would be harsh, and perhaps not altogether true, to say of him that\r\nhe felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he\r\nhad felt his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death: but certainly they impressed that event upon\r\nhim with new force, and communicated to it added weight and bitterness.\r\nIt was a rude shock to his sense of property in his child, that these\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94the mere dust of the earth, as he thought them\xe2\x80\x94should be\r\nnecessary to him; and it was natural that in proportion as he felt\r\ndisturbed by it, he should deplore the occurrence which had made them\r\nso. For all his starched, impenetrable dignity and composure, he wiped\r\nblinding tears from his eyes as he paced up and down his room; and\r\noften said, with an emotion of which he would not, for the world, have\r\nhad a witness, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may have been characteristic of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s pride, that he pitied\r\nhimself through the child. Not poor me. Not poor widower, confiding by\r\nconstraint in the wife of an ignorant Hind who has been working \xe2\x80\x9cmostly\r\nunderground\xe2\x80\x9d all his life, and yet at whose door Death had never\r\nknocked, and at whose poor table four sons daily sit\xe2\x80\x94but poor little\r\nfellow!\r\n\r\nThose words being on his lips, it occurred to him\xe2\x80\x94and it is an instance\r\nof the strong attraction with which his hopes and fears and all his\r\nthoughts were tending to one centre\xe2\x80\x94that a great temptation was being\r\nplaced in this woman\xe2\x80\x99s way. Her infant was a boy too. Now, would it be\r\npossible for her to change them?\r\n\r\nThough he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic\r\nand unlikely\xe2\x80\x94though possible, there was no denying\xe2\x80\x94he could not help\r\npursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his\r\ncondition would be, if he should discover such an imposture when he was\r\ngrown old. Whether a man so situated would be able to pluck away the\r\nresult of so many years of usage, confidence, and belief, from the\r\nimpostor, and endow a stranger with it?\r\n\r\nBut it was idle speculating thus. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. In a moment\r\nafterwards he determined that it could, but that such women were\r\nconstantly observed, and had no opportunity given them for the\r\naccomplishment of such a design, even when they were so wicked as to\r\nentertain it. In another moment, he was remembering how few such cases\r\nseemed to have ever happened. In another moment he was wondering\r\nwhether they ever happened and were not found out.\r\n\r\nAs his unusual emotion subsided, these misgivings gradually melted\r\naway, though so much of their shadow remained behind, that he was\r\nconstant in his resolution to look closely after Richards himself,\r\nwithout appearing to do so. Being now in an easier frame of mind, he\r\nregarded the woman\xe2\x80\x99s station as rather an advantageous circumstance\r\nthan otherwise, by placing, in itself, a broad distance between her and\r\nthe child, and rendering their separation easy and natural. Thence he\r\npassed to the contemplation of the future glories of Dombey and Son,\r\nand dismissed the memory of his wife, for the time being, with a\r\ntributary sigh or two.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between Mrs Chick and\r\nRichards, with the assistance of Miss Tox; and Richards being with much\r\nceremony invested with the Dombey baby, as if it were an Order,\r\nresigned her own, with many tears and kisses, to Jemima. Glasses of\r\nwine were then produced, to sustain the drooping spirits of the family;\r\nand Miss Tox, busying herself in dispensing \xe2\x80\x9ctastes\xe2\x80\x9d to the younger\r\nbranches, bred them up to their father\xe2\x80\x99s business with such surprising\r\nexpedition, that she made chokers of four of them in a quarter of a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass yourself, Sir, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, as\r\nToodle appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9csince you are suppressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re very glad to leave your dear good wife in such a\r\ncomfortable home, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, nodding and winking\r\nat him stealthily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s wishing of her back agin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly cried more than ever at this. So Mrs Chick, who had her matronly\r\napprehensions that this indulgence in grief might be prejudicial to the\r\nlittle Dombey (\xe2\x80\x9cacid, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered Miss Tox), hastened to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour little child will thrive charmingly with your sister Jemima,\r\nRichards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick; \xe2\x80\x9cand you have only to make an effort\xe2\x80\x94this is\r\na world of effort, you know, Richards\xe2\x80\x94to be very happy indeed. You have\r\nbeen already measured for your mourning, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94es, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99ll fit beautifully. I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the same\r\nyoung person has made me many dresses. The very best materials, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so smart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your husband won\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyou; will you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should know her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, gruffly, \xe2\x80\x9canyhows and anywheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToodle was evidently not to be bought over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to living, Richards, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, the very\r\nbest of everything will be at your disposal. You will order your little\r\ndinner every day; and anything you take a fancy to, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will be as\r\nreadily provided as if you were a Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, keeping up the ball with great\r\nsympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as to porter!\xe2\x80\x94quite unlimited, will it not, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick in the same tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a little\r\nabstinence, you know, my dear, in point of vegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pickles, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith such exceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll consult her choice\r\nentirely, and be under no restraint at all, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, of course, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9chowever fond she is of\r\nher own dear little child\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Louisa, you don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for\r\nbeing fond of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Chick, benignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cshe naturally must be interested in her\r\nyoung charge, and must consider it a privilege to see a little cherub\r\nconnected with the superior classes, gradually unfolding itself from\r\nday to day at one common fountain\xe2\x80\x94is it not so, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost undoubtedly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my love, she\xe2\x80\x99s already\r\nquite contented and comfortable, and means to say goodbye to her sister\r\nJemima and her little pets, and her good honest husband, with a light\r\nheart and a smile; don\xe2\x80\x99t she, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure she does!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding which, however, poor Polly embraced them all round in\r\ngreat distress, and coming to her spouse at last, could not make up her\r\nmind to part from him, until he gently disengaged himself, at the close\r\nof the following allegorical piece of consolation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly, old \xe2\x80\x9cooman, whatever you do, my darling, hold up your head and\r\nfight low. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only rule as I know on, that\xe2\x80\x99ll carry anyone\r\nthrough life. You always have held up your head and fought low, Polly.\r\nDo it now, or Bricks is no longer so. God bless you, Polly! Me and\r\nJ\xe2\x80\x99mima will do your duty by you; and with relating to your\xe2\x80\x99n, hold up\r\nyour head and fight low, Polly, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortified by this golden secret, Polly finally ran away to avoid any\r\nmore particular leave-taking between herself and the children. But the\r\nstratagem hardly succeeded as well as it deserved; for the smallest boy\r\nbut one divining her intent, immediately began swarming upstairs after\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94if that word of doubtful etymology be admissible\xe2\x80\x94on his arms and\r\nlegs; while the eldest (known in the family by the name of Biler, in\r\nremembrance of the steam engine) beat a demoniacal tattoo with his\r\nboots, expressive of grief; in which he was joined by the rest of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nA quantity of oranges and halfpence thrust indiscriminately on each\r\nyoung Toodle, checked the first violence of their regret, and the\r\nfamily were speedily transported to their own home, by means of the\r\nhackney-coach kept in waiting for that purpose. The children, under the\r\nguardianship of Jemima, blocked up the window, and dropped out oranges\r\nand halfpence all the way along. Mr Toodle himself preferred to ride\r\nbehind among the spikes, as being the mode of conveyance to which he\r\nwas best accustomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nIn which Mr Dombey, as a Man and a Father, is seen at the Head of the\r\nHome-Department\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funeral of the deceased lady having been \xe2\x80\x9cperformed\xe2\x80\x9d to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the undertaker, as well as of the neighbourhood at\r\nlarge, which is generally disposed to be captious on such a point, and\r\nis prone to take offence at any omissions or short-comings in the\r\nceremonies, the various members of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s household subsided into\r\ntheir several places in the domestic system. That small world, like the\r\ngreat one out of doors, had the capacity of easily forgetting its dead;\r\nand when the cook had said she was a quiet-tempered lady, and the\r\nhouse-keeper had said it was the common lot, and the butler had said\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99d have thought it, and the housemaid had said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nbelieve it, and the footman had said it seemed exactly like a dream,\r\nthey had quite worn the subject out, and began to think their mourning\r\nwas wearing rusty too.\r\n\r\nOn Richards, who was established upstairs in a state of honourable\r\ncaptivity, the dawn of her new life seemed to break cold and grey. Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s house was a large one, on the shady side of a tall, dark,\r\ndreadfully genteel street in the region between Portland Place and\r\nBryanstone Square. It was a corner house, with great wide areas\r\ncontaining cellars frowned upon by barred windows, and leered at by\r\ncrooked-eyed doors leading to dustbins. It was a house of dismal state,\r\nwith a circular back to it, containing a whole suite of drawing-rooms\r\nlooking upon a gravelled yard, where two gaunt trees, with blackened\r\ntrunks and branches, rattled rather than rustled, their leaves were so\r\nsmoked-dried. The summer sun was never on the street, but in the\r\nmorning about breakfast-time, when it came with the water-carts and the\r\nold clothes men, and the people with geraniums, and the\r\numbrella-mender, and the man who trilled the little bell of the Dutch\r\nclock as he went along. It was soon gone again to return no more that\r\nday; and the bands of music and the straggling Punch\xe2\x80\x99s shows going\r\nafter it, left it a prey to the most dismal of organs, and white mice;\r\nwith now and then a porcupine, to vary the entertainments; until the\r\nbutlers whose families were dining out, began to stand at the\r\nhouse-doors in the twilight, and the lamp-lighter made his nightly\r\nfailure in attempting to brighten up the street with gas.\r\n\r\nIt was as blank a house inside as outside. When the funeral was over,\r\nMr Dombey ordered the furniture to be covered up\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to preserve it\r\nfor the son with whom his plans were all associated\xe2\x80\x94and the rooms to be\r\nungarnished, saving such as he retained for himself on the ground\r\nfloor. Accordingly, mysterious shapes were made of tables and chairs,\r\nheaped together in the middle of rooms, and covered over with great\r\nwinding-sheets. Bell-handles, window-blinds, and looking-glasses, being\r\npapered up in journals, daily and weekly, obtruded fragmentary accounts\r\nof deaths and dreadful murders. Every chandelier or lustre, muffled in\r\nholland, looked like a monstrous tear depending from the ceiling\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\nOdours, as from vaults and damp places, came out of the chimneys. The\r\ndead and buried lady was awful in a picture-frame of ghastly bandages.\r\nEvery gust of wind that rose, brought eddying round the corner from the\r\nneighbouring mews, some fragments of the straw that had been strewn\r\nbefore the house when she was ill, mildewed remains of which were still\r\ncleaving to the neighbourhood: and these, being always drawn by some\r\ninvisible attraction to the threshold of the dirty house to let\r\nimmediately opposite, addressed a dismal eloquence to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe apartments which Mr Dombey reserved for his own inhabiting, were\r\nattainable from the hall, and consisted of a sitting-room; a library,\r\nwhich was in fact a dressing-room, so that the smell of hot-pressed\r\npaper, vellum, morocco, and Russia leather, contended in it with the\r\nsmell of divers pairs of boots; and a kind of conservatory or little\r\nglass breakfast-room beyond, commanding a prospect of the trees before\r\nmentioned, and, generally speaking, of a few prowling cats. These three\r\nrooms opened upon one another. In the morning, when Mr Dombey was at\r\nhis breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them, as\r\nwell as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner, a bell was rung\r\nfor Richards to repair to this glass chamber, and there walk to and fro\r\nwith her young charge. From the glimpses she caught of Mr Dombey at\r\nthese times, sitting in the dark distance, looking out towards the\r\ninfant from among the dark heavy furniture\xe2\x80\x94the house had been inhabited\r\nfor years by his father, and in many of its appointments was\r\nold-fashioned and grim\xe2\x80\x94she began to entertain ideas of him in his\r\nsolitary state, as if he were a lone prisoner in a cell, or a strange\r\napparition that was not to be accosted or understood. Mr Dombey came to\r\nbe, in the course of a few days, invested in his own person, to her\r\nsimple thinking, with all the mystery and gloom of his house. As she\r\nwalked up and down the glass room, or sat hushing the baby there\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nshe very often did for hours together, when the dusk was closing in,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94she would sometimes try to pierce the gloom beyond, and make out\r\nhow he was looking and what he was doing. Sensible that she was plainly\r\nto be seen by him, however, she never dared to pry in that direction\r\nbut very furtively and for a moment at a time. Consequently she made\r\nout nothing, and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s foster-mother had led this life herself, and had\r\ncarried little Paul through it for some weeks; and had returned\r\nupstairs one day from a melancholy saunter through the dreary rooms of\r\nstate (she never went out without Mrs Chick, who called on fine\r\nmornings, usually accompanied by Miss Tox, to take her and Baby for an\r\nairing\xe2\x80\x94or in other words, to march them gravely up and down the\r\npavement, like a walking funeral); when, as she was sitting in her own\r\nroom, the door was slowly and quietly opened, and a dark-eyed little\r\ngirl looked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Florence come home from her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nRichards, who had never seen the child before. \xe2\x80\x9cHope I see you well,\r\nMiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child, pointing to the Baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Richards. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and kiss him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the child, instead of advancing, looked her earnestly in the face,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with my Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless the little creeter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Richards, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a sad question!\r\nI done? Nothing, Miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have they done with my Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the child, with exactly\r\nthe same look and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such a melting thing in all my life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, who\r\nnaturally substituted for this child one of her own, inquiring for\r\nherself in like circumstances. \xe2\x80\x9cCome nearer here, my dear Miss! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe afraid of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, drawing nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want\r\nto know what they have done with my Mama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart swelled so as she stood before the woman, looking into her\r\neyes, that she was fain to press her little hand upon her breast and\r\nhold it there. Yet there was a purpose in the child that prevented both\r\nher slender figure and her searching gaze from faltering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wear that pretty black frock in\r\nremembrance of your Mama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can remember my Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child, with tears springing to\r\nher eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cin any frock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people put on black, to remember people when they\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere gone?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down by me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a quick perception that it was intended to relate to what she had\r\nasked, little Florence laid aside the bonnet she had held in her hand\r\nuntil now, and sat down on a stool at the Nurse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, looking up into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a lady\xe2\x80\x94a very good lady,\r\nand her little daughter dearly loved her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very good lady and her little daughter dearly loved her,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, when God thought it right that it should be so, was taken ill and\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDied, never to be seen again by anyone on earth, and was buried in the\r\nground where the trees grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cold ground?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, shuddering again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! The warm ground,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Polly, seizing her advantage, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\r\nthe ugly little seeds turn into beautiful flowers, and into grass, and\r\ncorn, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all besides. Where good people turn into\r\nbright angels, and fly away to Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child, who had dropped her head, raised it again, and sat looking\r\nat her intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo; let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, not a little flurried between this\r\nearnest scrutiny, her desire to comfort the child, her sudden success,\r\nand her very slight confidence in her own powers. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, when this lady\r\ndied, wherever they took her, or wherever they put her, she went to\r\nGOD! and she prayed to Him, this lady did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, affecting\r\nherself beyond measure; being heartily in earnest, \xe2\x80\x9cto teach her little\r\ndaughter to be sure of that in her heart: and to know that she was\r\nhappy there and loved her still: and to hope and try\xe2\x80\x94Oh, all her\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94to meet her there one day, never, never, never to part any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the child, springing up, and clasping her\r\nround the neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the child\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, drawing her to her breast: \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nlittle daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart was so full of the truth of this, that even\r\nwhen she heard it from a strange nurse that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it right, but\r\nwas a poor mother herself and that was all, she found a comfort in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so lonely\xe2\x80\x94sobbed and cried upon her bosom\xe2\x80\x94took kindly to\r\nthe baby lying in her lap\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94there, there, there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly,\r\nsmoothing the child\xe2\x80\x99s curls and dropping tears upon them. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, poor\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, Miss Floy! And won\xe2\x80\x99t your Pa be angry neither!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a quick\r\nvoice at the door, proceeding from a short, brown, womanly girl of\r\nfourteen, with a little snub nose, and black eyes like jet beads. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nit was \xe2\x80\x9ctickerlerly given out that you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to go and worrit the wet\r\nnurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe don\xe2\x80\x99t worry me,\xe2\x80\x9d was the surprised rejoinder of Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\r\nfond of children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but begging your pardon, Mrs Richards, that don\xe2\x80\x99t matter, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the black-eyed girl, who was so desperately sharp and\r\nbiting that she seemed to make one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes water. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be very fond of\r\npennywinkles, Mrs Richards, but it don\xe2\x80\x99t follow that I\xe2\x80\x99m to have \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nfor tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Mrs Richards, don\xe2\x80\x99t it!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sharp girl.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemembering, however, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good, that Miss Floy\xe2\x80\x99s under my\r\ncharge, and Master Paul\xe2\x80\x99s under your\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still we needn\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it,\r\nwe needn\xe2\x80\x99t stand upon that footing, Miss Floy being a permanency,\r\nMaster Paul a temporary.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire made use of none but comma pauses;\r\nshooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence, and in one\r\nbreath, if possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence has just come home, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs Richards, just come, and here, Miss Floy, before you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nin the house a quarter of an hour, you go a smearing your wet face\r\nagainst the expensive mourning that Mrs Richards is a wearing for your\r\nMa!\xe2\x80\x9d With this remonstrance, young Spitfire, whose real name was Susan\r\nNipper, detached the child from her new friend by a wrench\xe2\x80\x94as if she\r\nwere a tooth. But she seemed to do it, more in the excessively sharp\r\nexercise of her official functions, than with any deliberate\r\nunkindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite happy, now she has come home again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly,\r\nnodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwill be so pleased to see her dear Papa tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLork, Mrs Richards!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Nipper, taking up her words with a\r\njerk. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t. See her dear Papa indeed! I should like to see her do\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLork, Mrs Richards, no, her Pa\xe2\x80\x99s a deal too wrapped up in somebody\r\nelse, and before there was a somebody else to be wrapped up in she\r\nnever was a favourite, girls are thrown away in this house, Mrs\r\nRichards, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child looked quickly from one nurse to the other, as if she\r\nunderstood and felt what was said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr Dombey seen her since\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Susan Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cNot once since, and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nset his eyes upon her before that for months and months, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99d have known her for his own child if he had met her in the\r\nstreets, or would know her for his own child if he was to meet her in\r\nthe streets to-morrow, Mrs Richards, as to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spitfire, with a\r\ngiggle, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if he\xe2\x80\x99s aweer of my existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards; meaning, not Miss Nipper, but the little\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there\xe2\x80\x99s a Tartar within a hundred miles of where we\xe2\x80\x99re now in\r\nconversation, I can tell you, Mrs Richards, present company always\r\nexcepted too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper; \xe2\x80\x9cwish you good morning, Mrs Richards,\r\nnow Miss Floy, you come along with me, and don\xe2\x80\x99t go hanging back like a\r\nnaughty wicked child that judgments is no example to, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of being thus adjured, and in spite also of some hauling on\r\nthe part of Susan Nipper, tending towards the dislocation of her right\r\nshoulder, little Florence broke away, and kissed her new friend,\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! after it was given out so \xe2\x80\x9ctickerlerly, that Mrs Richards\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be made free with!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the sweet thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you! I shall come to see you\r\nagain soon, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to see me? Susan will let us. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nSusan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpitfire seemed to be in the main a good-natured little body, although\r\na disciple of that school of trainers of the young idea which holds\r\nthat childhood, like money, must be shaken and rattled and jostled\r\nabout a good deal to keep it bright. For, being thus appealed to with\r\nsome endearing gestures and caresses, she folded her small arms and\r\nshook her head, and conveyed a relenting expression into her\r\nvery-wide-open black eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t right of you to ask it, Miss Floy, for you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrefuse you, but Mrs Richards and me will see what can be done, if Mrs\r\nRichards likes, I may wish, you see, to take a voyage to Chaney, Mrs\r\nRichards, but I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to leave the London Docks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards assented to the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis house ain\xe2\x80\x99t so exactly ringing with merry-making,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nNipper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one need be lonelier than one must be. Your Toxes and\r\nyour Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth, Mrs Richards, but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I need offer \xe2\x80\x99em the whole set.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis proposition was also assented to by Richards, as an obvious one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m agreeable, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cto live friendly, Mrs\r\nRichards, while Master Paul continues a permanency, if the means can be\r\nplanned out without going openly against orders, but goodness gracious\r\nMiss Floy, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got your things off yet, you naughty child, you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Susan Nipper, in a transport of coercion, made a\r\ncharge at her young ward, and swept her out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe child, in her grief and neglect, was so gentle, so quiet, and\r\nuncomplaining; was possessed of so much affection that no one seemed to\r\ncare to have, and so much sorrowful intelligence that no one seemed to\r\nmind or think about the wounding of, that Polly\xe2\x80\x99s heart was sore when\r\nshe was left alone again. In the simple passage that had taken place\r\nbetween herself and the motherless little girl, her own motherly heart\r\nhad been touched no less than the child\xe2\x80\x99s; and she felt, as the child\r\ndid, that there was something of confidence and interest between them\r\nfrom that moment.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mr Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s great reliance on Polly, she was perhaps in\r\npoint of artificial accomplishments very little his superior. She had\r\nbeen good-humouredly working and drudging for her life all her life,\r\nand was a sober steady-going person, with matter-of-fact ideas about\r\nthe butcher and baker, and the division of pence into farthings. But\r\nshe was a good plain sample of a nature that is ever, in the mass,\r\nbetter, truer, higher, nobler, quicker to feel, and much more constant\r\nto retain, all tenderness and pity, self-denial and devotion, than the\r\nnature of men. And, perhaps, unlearned as she was, she could have\r\nbrought a dawning knowledge home to Mr Dombey at that early day, which\r\nwould not then have struck him in the end like lightning.\r\n\r\nBut this is from the purpose. Polly only thought, at that time, of\r\nimproving on her successful propitiation of Miss Nipper, and devising\r\nsome means of having little Florence aide her, lawfully, and without\r\nrebellion. An opening happened to present itself that very night.\r\n\r\nShe had been rung down into the glass room as usual, and had walked\r\nabout and about it a long time, with the baby in her arms, when, to her\r\ngreat surprise and dismay, Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94whom she had seen at first leaning\r\non his elbow at the table, and afterwards walking up and down the\r\nmiddle room, drawing, each time, a little nearer, she thought, to the\r\nopen folding doors\xe2\x80\x94came out, suddenly, and stopped before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Richards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust the same austere, stiff gentleman, as he had appeared to her on\r\nthat first day. Such a hard-looking gentleman, that she involuntarily\r\ndropped her eyes and her curtsey at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Master Paul, Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite thriving, Sir, and well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, glancing with great interest at the tiny\r\nface she uncovered for his observation, and yet affecting to be half\r\ncareless of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey give you everything you want, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, thank you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly appended such an obvious hesitation to this reply,\r\nhowever, that Mr Dombey, who had turned away; stopped, and turned round\r\nagain, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Sir, the child is very much disposed to take notice of\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards, with another curtsey, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94upstairs is a little\r\ndull for him, perhaps, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begged them to take you out for airings, constantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well! You shall go out oftener. You\xe2\x80\x99re quite right to\r\nmention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we go out quite plenty\r\nSir, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed Sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe nothing is so good for making children lively and cheerful,\r\nSir, as seeing other children playing about \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Polly,\r\ntaking courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I mentioned to you, Richards, when you came here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey, with a frown, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I wished you to see as little of your\r\nfamily as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear yes, Sir, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as thinking of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can continue your walk\r\nif you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he disappeared into his inner room; and Polly had the\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that he had thoroughly misunderstood her\r\nobject, and that she had fallen into disgrace without the least\r\nadvancement of her purpose.\r\n\r\nNext night, she found him walking about the conservatory when she came\r\ndown. As she stopped at the door, checked by this unusual sight, and\r\nuncertain whether to advance or retreat, he called her in. His mind was\r\ntoo much set on Dombey and Son, it soon appeared, to admit of his\r\nhaving forgotten her suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really think that sort of society is good for the child,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid sharply, as if there had been no interval since she proposed it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be better than Miss Florence, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly eagerly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I understood from her maid that they were not to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey rang the bell, and walked till it was answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them always to let Miss Florence be with Richards when she\r\nchooses, and go out with her, and so forth. Tell them to let the\r\nchildren be together, when Richards wishes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe iron was now hot, and Richards striking on it boldly\xe2\x80\x94it was a good\r\ncause and she bold in it, though instinctively afraid of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x94requested that Miss Florence might be sent down then and there,\r\nto make friends with her little brother.\r\n\r\nShe feigned to be dandling the child as the servant retired on this\r\nerrand, but she thought that she saw Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s colour changed; that\r\nthe expression of his face quite altered; that he turned, hurriedly, as\r\nif to gainsay what he had said, or she had said, or both, and was only\r\ndeterred by very shame.\r\n\r\nAnd she was right. The last time he had seen his slighted child, there\r\nhad been that in the sad embrace between her and her dying mother,\r\nwhich was at once a revelation and a reproach to him. Let him be\r\nabsorbed as he would in the Son on whom he built such high hopes, he\r\ncould not forget that closing scene. He could not forget that he had\r\nhad no part in it. That, at the bottom of its clear depths of\r\ntenderness and truth lay those two figures clasped in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms, while he stood on the bank above them, looking down a mere\r\nspectator\xe2\x80\x94not a sharer with them\xe2\x80\x94quite shut out.\r\n\r\nUnable to exclude these things from his remembrance, or to keep his\r\nmind free from such imperfect shapes of the meaning with which they\r\nwere fraught, as were able to make themselves visible to him through\r\nthe mist of his pride, his previous feeling of indifference towards\r\nlittle Florence changed into an uneasiness of an extraordinary kind.\r\nYoung as she was, and possessing in any eyes but his (and perhaps in\r\nhis too) even more than the usual amount of childish simplicity and\r\nconfidence, he almost felt as if she watched and distrusted him. As if\r\nshe held the clue to something secret in his breast, of the nature of\r\nwhich he was hardly informed himself. As if she had an innate knowledge\r\nof one jarring and discordant string within him, and her very breath\r\ncould sound it.\r\n\r\nHis feeling about the child had been negative from her birth. He had\r\nnever conceived an aversion to her: it had not been worth his while or\r\nin his humour. She had never been a positively disagreeable object to\r\nhim. But now he was ill at ease about her. She troubled his peace. He\r\nwould have preferred to put her idea aside altogether, if he had known\r\nhow. Perhaps\xe2\x80\x94who shall decide on such mysteries!\xe2\x80\x94he was afraid that he\r\nmight come to hate her.\r\n\r\nWhen little Florence timidly presented herself, Mr Dombey stopped in\r\nhis pacing up and down and looked towards her. Had he looked with\r\ngreater interest and with a father\xe2\x80\x99s eye, he might have read in her\r\nkeen glance the impulses and fears that made her waver; the passionate\r\ndesire to run clinging to him, crying, as she hid her face in his\r\nembrace, \xe2\x80\x9cOh father, try to love me! there\xe2\x80\x99s no one else!\xe2\x80\x9d the dread of\r\na repulse; the fear of being too bold, and of offending him; the\r\npitiable need in which she stood of some assurance and encouragement;\r\nand how her overcharged young heart was wandering to find some natural\r\nresting-place, for its sorrow and affection.\r\n\r\nBut he saw nothing of this. He saw her pause irresolutely at the door\r\nand look towards him; and he saw no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccome in: what is the child afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came in; and after glancing round her for a moment with an\r\nuncertain air, stood pressing her small hands hard together, close\r\nwithin the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears that stood in her eyes as she raised them quickly to his\r\nface, were frozen by the expression it wore. She looked down again, and\r\nput out her trembling hand.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey took it loosely in his own, and stood looking down upon her\r\nfor a moment, as if he knew as little as the child, what to say or do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! Be a good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, patting her on the head, and\r\nregarding her as it were by stealth with a disturbed and doubtful look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Richards! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis little daughter hesitated for another instant as though she would\r\nhave clung about him still, or had some lingering hope that he might\r\nraise her in his arms and kiss her. She looked up in his face once\r\nmore. He thought how like her expression was then, to what it had been\r\nwhen she looked round at the Doctor\xe2\x80\x94that night\xe2\x80\x94and instinctively\r\ndropped her hand and turned away.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to perceive that Florence was at a great\r\ndisadvantage in her father\xe2\x80\x99s presence. It was not only a constraint\r\nupon the child\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but even upon the natural grace and freedom of\r\nher actions. As she sported and played about her baby brother that\r\nnight, her manner was seldom so winning and so pretty as it naturally\r\nwas, and sometimes when in his pacing to and fro, he came near her (she\r\nhad, perhaps, for the moment, forgotten him) it changed upon the\r\ninstant and became forced and embarrassed.\r\n\r\nStill, Polly persevered with all the better heart for seeing this; and,\r\njudging of Mr Dombey by herself, had great confidence in the mute\r\nappeal of poor little Florence\xe2\x80\x99s mourning dress. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cif he takes only to one little motherless child, when\r\nhe has another, and that a girl, before his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, Polly kept her before his eyes, as long as she could, and managed\r\nso well with little Paul, as to make it very plain that he was all the\r\nlivelier for his sister\xe2\x80\x99s company. When it was time to withdraw\r\nupstairs again, she would have sent Florence into the inner room to say\r\ngood-night to her father, but the child was timid and drew back; and\r\nwhen she urged her again, said, spreading her hands before her eyes, as\r\nif to shut out her own unworthiness, \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! He don\xe2\x80\x99t want me. He\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe little altercation between them had attracted the notice of Mr\r\nDombey, who inquired from the table where he was sitting at his wine,\r\nwhat the matter was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence was afraid of interrupting, Sir, if she came in to say\r\ngood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can let her come and go\r\nwithout regarding me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child shrunk as she listened\xe2\x80\x94and was gone, before her humble friend\r\nlooked round again.\r\n\r\nHowever, Polly triumphed not a little in the success of her\r\nwell-intentioned scheme, and in the address with which she had brought\r\nit to bear: whereof she made a full disclosure to Spitfire when she was\r\nonce more safely entrenched upstairs. Miss Nipper received that proof\r\nof her confidence, as well as the prospect of their free association\r\nfor the future, rather coldly, and was anything but enthusiastic in her\r\ndemonstrations of joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would have been pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Mrs Richards, I\xe2\x80\x99m very well pleased, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nSusan, who had suddenly become so very upright that she seemed to have\r\nput an additional bone in her stays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t show it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Being only a permanency I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to show it like a\r\ntemporary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cTemporaries carries it all before \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nhere, I find, but though there\xe2\x80\x99s a excellent party-wall between this\r\nhouse and the next, I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly like to go to it, Mrs Richards,\r\nnotwithstanding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nIn which some more First Appearances are made on the Stage of these\r\nAdventures\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the offices of Dombey and Son were within the liberties of the\r\nCity of London, and within hearing of Bow Bells, when their clashing\r\nvoices were not drowned by the uproar in the streets, yet were there\r\nhints of adventurous and romantic story to be observed in some of the\r\nadjacent objects. Gog and Magog held their state within ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwalk; the Royal Exchange was close at hand; the Bank of England, with\r\nits vaults of gold and silver \xe2\x80\x9cdown among the dead men\xe2\x80\x9d underground,\r\nwas their magnificent neighbour. Just round the corner stood the rich\r\nEast India House, teeming with suggestions of precious stuffs and\r\nstones, tigers, elephants, howdahs, hookahs, umbrellas, palm trees,\r\npalanquins, and gorgeous princes of a brown complexion sitting on\r\ncarpets, with their slippers very much turned up at the toes. Anywhere\r\nin the immediate vicinity there might be seen pictures of ships\r\nspeeding away full sail to all parts of the world; outfitting\r\nwarehouses ready to pack off anybody anywhere, fully equipped in half\r\nan hour; and little timber midshipmen in obsolete naval uniforms,\r\neternally employed outside the shop doors of nautical Instrument-makers\r\nin taking observations of the hackney carriages.\r\n\r\nSole master and proprietor of one of these effigies\xe2\x80\x94of that which might\r\nbe called, familiarly, the woodenest\xe2\x80\x94of that which thrust itself out\r\nabove the pavement, right leg foremost, with a suavity the least\r\nendurable, and had the shoe buckles and flapped waistcoat the least\r\nreconcileable to human reason, and bore at its right eye the most\r\noffensively disproportionate piece of machinery\xe2\x80\x94sole master and\r\nproprietor of that Midshipman, and proud of him too, an elderly\r\ngentleman in a Welsh wig had paid house-rent, taxes, rates, and dues,\r\nfor more years than many a full-grown midshipman of flesh and blood has\r\nnumbered in his life; and midshipmen who have attained a pretty green\r\nold age, have not been wanting in the English Navy.\r\n\r\nThe stock-in-trade of this old gentleman comprised chronometers,\r\nbarometers, telescopes, compasses, charts, maps, sextants, quadrants,\r\nand specimens of every kind of instrument used in the working of a\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s course, or the keeping of a ship\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning, or the prosecuting\r\nof a ship\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries. Objects in brass and glass were in his drawers\r\nand on his shelves, which none but the initiated could have found the\r\ntop of, or guessed the use of, or having once examined, could have ever\r\ngot back again into their mahogany nests without assistance. Everything\r\nwas jammed into the tightest cases, fitted into the narrowest corners,\r\nfenced up behind the most impertinent cushions, and screwed into the\r\nacutest angles, to prevent its philosophical composure from being\r\ndisturbed by the rolling of the sea. Such extraordinary precautions\r\nwere taken in every instance to save room, and keep the thing compact;\r\nand so much practical navigation was fitted, and cushioned, and screwed\r\ninto every box (whether the box was a mere slab, as some were, or\r\nsomething between a cocked hat and a star-fish, as others were, and\r\nthose quite mild and modest boxes as compared with others); that the\r\nshop itself, partaking of the general infection, seemed almost to\r\nbecome a snug, sea-going, ship-shape concern, wanting only good\r\nsea-room, in the event of an unexpected launch, to work its way\r\nsecurely to any desert island in the world.\r\n\r\nMany minor incidents in the household life of the Ships\xe2\x80\x99\r\nInstrument-maker who was proud of his little Midshipman, assisted and\r\nbore out this fancy. His acquaintance lying chiefly among\r\nship-chandlers and so forth, he had always plenty of the veritable\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99 biscuit on his table. It was familiar with dried meats and\r\ntongues, possessing an extraordinary flavour of rope yarn. Pickles were\r\nproduced upon it, in great wholesale jars, with \xe2\x80\x9cdealer in all kinds of\r\nShips\xe2\x80\x99 Provisions\xe2\x80\x9d on the label; spirits were set forth in case bottles\r\nwith no throats. Old prints of ships with alphabetical references to\r\ntheir various mysteries, hung in frames upon the walls; the Tartar\r\nFrigate under weigh, was on the plates; outlandish shells, seaweeds,\r\nand mosses, decorated the chimney-piece; the little wainscotted back\r\nparlour was lighted by a sky-light, like a cabin.\r\n\r\nHere he lived too, in skipper-like state, all alone with his nephew\r\nWalter: a boy of fourteen who looked quite enough like a midshipman, to\r\ncarry out the prevailing idea. But there it ended, for Solomon Gills\r\nhimself (more generally called old Sol) was far from having a maritime\r\nappearance. To say nothing of his Welsh wig, which was as plain and\r\nstubborn a Welsh wig as ever was worn, and in which he looked like\r\nanything but a Rover, he was a slow, quiet-spoken, thoughtful old\r\nfellow, with eyes as red as if they had been small suns looking at you\r\nthrough a fog; and a newly-awakened manner, such as he might have\r\nacquired by having stared for three or four days successively through\r\nevery optical instrument in his shop, and suddenly came back to the\r\nworld again, to find it green. The only change ever known in his\r\noutward man, was from a complete suit of coffee-colour cut very square,\r\nand ornamented with glaring buttons, to the same suit of coffee-colour\r\nminus the inexpressibles, which were then of a pale nankeen. He wore a\r\nvery precise shirt-frill, and carried a pair of first-rate spectacles\r\non his forehead, and a tremendous chronometer in his fob, rather than\r\ndoubt which precious possession, he would have believed in a conspiracy\r\nagainst it on part of all the clocks and watches in the City, and even\r\nof the very Sun itself. Such as he was, such he had been in the shop\r\nand parlour behind the little Midshipman, for years upon years; going\r\nregularly aloft to bed every night in a howling garret remote from the\r\nlodgers, where, when gentlemen of England who lived below at ease had\r\nlittle or no idea of the state of the weather, it often blew great\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nIt is half-past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and an autumn afternoon, when the reader\r\nand Solomon Gills become acquainted. Solomon Gills is in the act of\r\nseeing what time it is by the unimpeachable chronometer. The usual\r\ndaily clearance has been making in the City for an hour or more; and\r\nthe human tide is still rolling westward. \xe2\x80\x9cThe streets have thinned,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas Mr Gills says, \xe2\x80\x9cvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d It threatens to be wet tonight. All the\r\nweatherglasses in the shop are in low spirits, and the rain already\r\nshines upon the cocked hat of the wooden Midshipman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Walter, I wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon Gills, after he had carefully\r\nput up the chronometer again. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s dinner been ready, half an hour,\r\nand no Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning round upon his stool behind the counter, Mr Gills looked out\r\namong the instruments in the window, to see if his nephew might be\r\ncrossing the road. No. He was not among the bobbing umbrellas, and he\r\ncertainly was not the newspaper boy in the oilskin cap who was slowly\r\nworking his way along the piece of brass outside, writing his name over\r\nMr Gills\xe2\x80\x99s name with his forefinger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was too fond of me to make a run of it, and go and\r\nenter himself aboard ship against my wishes, I should begin to be\r\nfidgetty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Gills, tapping two or three weather-glasses with his\r\nknuckles. \xe2\x80\x9cI really should. All in the Downs, eh! Lots of moisture!\r\nWell! it\xe2\x80\x99s wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Gills, blowing the dust off the glass top of a\r\ncompass-case, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t point more direct and due to the back\r\nparlour than the boy\xe2\x80\x99s inclination does after all. And the parlour\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear straighter either. Due north. Not the twentieth part of a\r\npoint either way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Uncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Instrument-maker, turning briskly round.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you are here, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cheerful looking, merry boy, fresh with running home in the rain;\r\nfair-faced, bright-eyed, and curly-haired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle, how have you got on without me all day? Is dinner ready?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be odd if I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on without a young dog like you a great deal better than\r\nwith you. As to dinner being ready, it\xe2\x80\x99s been ready this half hour and\r\nwaiting for you. As to being hungry, I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along then, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for the admiral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound the admiral!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Solomon Gills. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the Lord\r\nMayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for the admiral! Hurrah for the\r\nadmiral! For-ward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this word of command, the Welsh wig and its wearer were borne\r\nwithout resistance into the back parlour, as at the head of a boarding\r\nparty of five hundred men; and Uncle Sol and his nephew were speedily\r\nengaged on a fried sole with a prospect of steak to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Mayor, Wally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, \xe2\x80\x9cfor ever! No more admirals. The\r\nLord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s your admiral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is he though!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Sword\r\nBearer\xe2\x80\x99s better than him. He draws his sword sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a pretty figure he cuts with it for his pains,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nUncle. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Wally, listen to me. Look on the mantelshelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy who has cocked my silver mug up there, on a nail?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more mugs now. We must begin to drink out\r\nof glasses today, Walter. We are men of business. We belong to the\r\nCity. We started in life this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drink out of anything you like, so\r\nlong as I can drink to you. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to you, Uncle Sol, and Hurrah for\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Mayor,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, Common Council, and Livery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nboy. \xe2\x80\x9cLong life to \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe uncle nodded his head with great satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s hear something about the Firm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there\xe2\x80\x99s not much to be told about the Firm, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy,\r\nplying his knife and fork. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a precious dark set of offices, and in\r\nthe room where I sit, there\xe2\x80\x99s a high fender, and an iron safe, and some\r\ncards about ships that are going to sail, and an almanack, and some\r\ndesks and stools, and an inkbottle, and some books, and some boxes, and\r\na lot of cobwebs, and in one of \xe2\x80\x99em, just over my head, a shrivelled-up\r\nblue-bottle that looks as if it had hung there ever so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing else, except an old birdcage (I wonder how that ever came\r\nthere!) and a coal-scuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo bankers\xe2\x80\x99 books, or cheque books, or bills, or such tokens of wealth\r\nrolling in from day to day?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol, looking wistfully at his\r\nnephew out of the fog that always seemed to hang about him, and laying\r\nan unctuous emphasis upon the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, plenty of that I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his nephew carelessly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut all that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x99s in Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s room, or Mr Morfin\xe2\x80\x99s, or\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr Dombey been there today?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! In and out all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t take any notice of you, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes he did. He walked up to my seat,\xe2\x80\x94I wish he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so solemn and\r\nstiff, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x94and said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! you are the son of Mr Gills the Ships\xe2\x80\x99\r\nInstrument-maker.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nephew, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I said nephew, boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe. But I could take my oath he said son, Uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken I daresay. It\xe2\x80\x99s no matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter, but he needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so sharp, I thought.\r\nThere was no harm in it though he did say son. Then he told me that you\r\nhad spoken to him about me, and that he had found me employment in the\r\nHouse accordingly, and that I was expected to be attentive and\r\npunctual, and then he went away. I thought he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to like me\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Instrument-maker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to like him much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the boy, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so; I never thought\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon looked a little graver as he finished his dinner, and glanced\r\nfrom time to time at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s bright face. When dinner was done, and\r\nthe cloth was cleared away (the entertainment had been brought from a\r\nneighbouring eating-house), he lighted a candle, and went down below\r\ninto a little cellar, while his nephew, standing on the mouldy\r\nstaircase, dutifully held the light. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s groping here and\r\nthere, he presently returned with a very ancient-looking bottle,\r\ncovered with dust and dirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Uncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you about? that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nwonderful Madeira!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s only one more bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Sol nodded his head, implying that he knew very well what he was\r\nabout; and having drawn the cork in solemn silence, filled two glasses\r\nand set the bottle and a third clean glass on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall drink the other bottle, Wally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you come to\r\ngood fortune; when you are a thriving, respected, happy man; when the\r\nstart in life you have made today shall have brought you, as I pray\r\nHeaven it may!\xe2\x80\x94to a smooth part of the course you have to run, my\r\nchild. My love to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the fog that hung about old Sol seemed to have got into his\r\nthroat; for he spoke huskily. His hand shook too, as he clinked his\r\nglass against his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s. But having once got the wine to his lips,\r\nhe tossed it off like a man, and smacked them afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, affecting to make light of it, while the\r\ntears stood in his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the honour you have done me, et cetera,\r\net cetera. I shall now beg to propose Mr Solomon Gills with three times\r\nthree and one cheer more. Hurrah! and you\xe2\x80\x99ll return thanks, Uncle, when\r\nwe drink the last bottle together; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey clinked their glasses again; and Walter, who was hoarding his\r\nwine, took a sip of it, and held the glass up to his eye with as\r\ncritical an air as he could possibly assume.\r\n\r\nHis Uncle sat looking at him for some time in silence. When their eyes\r\nat last met, he began at once to pursue the theme that had occupied his\r\nthoughts, aloud, as if he had been speaking all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin truth this business is merely a habit\r\nwith me. I am so accustomed to the habit that I could hardly live if I\r\nrelinquished it: but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing doing, nothing doing. When that\r\nuniform was worn,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing out towards the little Midshipman, \xe2\x80\x9cthen\r\nindeed, fortunes were to be made, and were made. But competition,\r\ncompetition\xe2\x80\x94new invention, new invention\xe2\x80\x94alteration, alteration\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s gone past me. I hardly know where I am myself, much less where\r\nmy customers are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind \xe2\x80\x99em, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you came home from weekly boarding-school at Peckham, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s ten days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember more\r\nthan one person that has come into the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo, Uncle, don\xe2\x80\x99t you recollect? There was the man who came to ask for\r\nchange for a sovereign\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Uncle! don\xe2\x80\x99t you call the woman anybody, who came to ask the way\r\nto Mile-End Turnpike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot her. Two persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy anything,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor want anything,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. If they had, they\xe2\x80\x99d gone to another shop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, in the\r\nsame tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there were two of \xe2\x80\x99em, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy, as if that were a\r\ngreat triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Wally,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old man, after a short pause: \xe2\x80\x9cnot being\r\nlike the Savages who came on Robinson Crusoe\xe2\x80\x99s Island, we can\xe2\x80\x99t live on\r\na man who asks for change for a sovereign, and a woman who inquires the\r\nway to Mile-End Turnpike. As I said just now, the world has gone past\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame it; but I no longer understand it. Tradesmen are not\r\nthe same as they used to be, apprentices are not the same, business is\r\nnot the same, business commodities are not the same. Seven-eighths of\r\nmy stock is old-fashioned. I am an old-fashioned man in an\r\nold-fashioned shop, in a street that is not the same as I remember it.\r\nI have fallen behind the time, and am too old to catch it again. Even\r\nthe noise it makes a long way ahead, confuses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter was going to speak, but his Uncle held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, Wally\xe2\x80\x94therefore it is that I am anxious you should be early\r\nin the busy world, and on the world\xe2\x80\x99s track. I am only the ghost of\r\nthis business\xe2\x80\x94its substance vanished long ago; and when I die, its\r\nghost will be laid. As it is clearly no inheritance for you then, I\r\nhave thought it best to use for your advantage, almost the only\r\nfragment of the old connexion that stands by me, through long habit.\r\nSome people suppose me to be wealthy. I wish for your sake they were\r\nright. But whatever I leave behind me, or whatever I can give you, you\r\nin such a House as Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s are in the road to use well and make the\r\nmost of. Be diligent, try to like it, my dear boy, work for a steady\r\nindependence, and be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything I can, Uncle, to deserve your affection. Indeed I\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he applied himself to\r\na second glass of the old Madeira, with increased relish. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to the\r\nSea,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s well enough in fiction, Wally, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo in fact: it won\xe2\x80\x99t do at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural enough that you should\r\nthink about it, associating it with all these familiar things; but it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon Gills rubbed his hands with an air of stealthy enjoyment, as he\r\ntalked of the sea, though; and looked on the seafaring objects about\r\nhim with inexpressible complacency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of this wine for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich has been to the\r\nEast Indies and back, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to say how often, and has been once\r\nround the world. Think of the pitch-dark nights, the roaring winds, and\r\nrolling seas:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thunder, lightning, rain, hail, storm of all kinds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat this wine has passed through. Think\r\nwhat a straining and creaking of timbers and masts: what a whistling\r\nand howling of the gale through ropes and rigging:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a clambering aloft of men, vying with each other who shall lie\r\nout first upon the yards to furl the icy sails, while the ship rolls\r\nand pitches, like mad!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his nephew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon: \xe2\x80\x9chas gone on, over the old cask that held\r\nthis wine. Why, when the Charming Sally went down in the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Baltic Sea, in the dead of night; five-and-twenty minutes past\r\ntwelve when the captain\xe2\x80\x99s watch stopped in his pocket; he lying dead\r\nagainst the main-mast\xe2\x80\x94on the fourteenth of February, seventeen\r\nforty-nine!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, with great animation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Sol, \xe2\x80\x9cquite right! Then, there were five\r\nhundred casks of such wine aboard; and all hands (except the first\r\nmate, first lieutenant, two seamen, and a lady, in a leaky boat) going\r\nto work to stave the casks, got drunk and died drunk, singing \xe2\x80\x98Rule\r\nBritannia\xe2\x80\x99, when she settled and went down, and ending with one awful\r\nscream in chorus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when the George the Second drove ashore, Uncle, on the coast of\r\nCornwall, in a dismal gale, two hours before daybreak, on the fourth of\r\nMarch, \xe2\x80\x9cseventy-one, she had near two hundred horses aboard; and the\r\nhorses breaking loose down below, early in the gale, and tearing to and\r\nfro, and trampling each other to death, made such noises, and set up\r\nsuch human cries, that the crew believing the ship to be full of\r\ndevils, some of the best men, losing heart and head, went overboard in\r\ndespair, and only two were left alive, at last, to tell the tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Polyphemus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate West India Trader, burden three hundred and fifty tons,\r\nCaptain, John Brown of Deptford. Owners, Wiggs and Co.,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sol; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she took fire, four days\xe2\x80\x99 sail with a fair\r\nwind out of Jamaica Harbour, in the night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were two brothers on board,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed his nephew, speaking\r\nvery fast and loud, \xe2\x80\x9cand there not being room for both of them in the\r\nonly boat that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t swamped, neither of them would consent to go,\r\nuntil the elder took the younger by the waist, and flung him in. And\r\nthen the younger, rising in the boat, cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Dear Edward, think of\r\nyour promised wife at home. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a boy. No one waits at home for\r\nme. Leap down into my place!\xe2\x80\x99 and flung himself in the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe kindling eye and heightened colour of the boy, who had risen from\r\nhis seat in the earnestness of what he said and felt, seemed to remind\r\nold Sol of something he had forgotten, or that his encircling mist had\r\nhitherto shut out. Instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes, as he\r\nhad evidently intended but a moment before, he gave a short dry cough,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! suppose we change the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the simple-minded Uncle in his secret attraction\r\ntowards the marvellous and adventurous\xe2\x80\x94of which he was, in some sort, a\r\ndistant relation, by his trade\xe2\x80\x94had greatly encouraged the same\r\nattraction in the nephew; and that everything that had ever been put\r\nbefore the boy to deter him from a life of adventure, had had the usual\r\nunaccountable effect of sharpening his taste for it. This is\r\ninvariable. It would seem as if there never was a book written, or a\r\nstory told, expressly with the object of keeping boys on shore, which\r\ndid not lure and charm them to the ocean, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nBut an addition to the little party now made its appearance, in the\r\nshape of a gentleman in a wide suit of blue, with a hook instead of a\r\nhand attached to his right wrist; very bushy black eyebrows; and a\r\nthick stick in his left hand, covered all over (like his nose) with\r\nknobs. He wore a loose black silk handkerchief round his neck, and such\r\na very large coarse shirt collar, that it looked like a small sail. He\r\nwas evidently the person for whom the spare wine-glass was intended,\r\nand evidently knew it; for having taken off his rough outer coat, and\r\nhung up, on a particular peg behind the door, such a hard glazed hat as\r\na sympathetic person\xe2\x80\x99s head might ache at the sight of, and which left\r\na red rim round his own forehead as if he had been wearing a tight\r\nbasin, he brought a chair to where the clean glass was, and sat himself\r\ndown behind it. He was usually addressed as Captain, this visitor; and\r\nhad been a pilot, or a skipper, or a privateersman, or all three\r\nperhaps; and was a very salt-looking man indeed.\r\n\r\nHis face, remarkable for a brown solidity, brightened as he shook hands\r\nwith Uncle and nephew; but he seemed to be of a laconic disposition,\r\nand merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Gills, pushing the bottle towards him.\r\n\r\nHe took it up, and having surveyed and smelt it, said with\r\nextraordinary expression:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Instrument-maker.\r\n\r\nUpon that he whistled as he filled his glass, and seemed to think they\r\nwere making holiday indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, arranging his hair (which was thin) with his hook,\r\nand then pointing it at the Instrument-maker, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him! Love!\r\nHonour! And Obey! Overhaul your catechism till you find that passage,\r\nand when found turn the leaf down. Success, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so perfectly satisfied both with his quotation and his reference\r\nto it, that he could not help repeating the words again in a low voice,\r\nand saying he had forgotten \xe2\x80\x99em these forty year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never wanted two or three words in my life that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere to lay my hand upon \xe2\x80\x99em, Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes of not\r\nwasting language as some do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reflection perhaps reminded him that he had better, like young\r\nNorval\xe2\x80\x99s father, \xe2\x80\x98increase his store.\xe2\x80\x99 At any rate he became silent,\r\nand remained so, until old Sol went out into the shop to light it up,\r\nwhen he turned to Walter, and said, without any introductory remark:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he could make a clock if he tried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it would go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, making a species of serpent in\r\nthe air with his hook. \xe2\x80\x9cLord, how that clock would go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two he seemed quite lost in contemplating the pace of\r\nthis ideal timepiece, and sat looking at the boy as if his face were\r\nthe dial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s chock-full of science,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, waving his hook towards\r\nthe stock-in-trade. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ye here! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a collection of \xe2\x80\x99em. Earth,\r\nair, or water. It\xe2\x80\x99s all one. Only say where you\xe2\x80\x99ll have it. Up in a\r\nballoon? There you are. Down in a bell? There you are. D\xe2\x80\x99ye want to put\r\nthe North Star in a pair of scales and weigh it? He\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may be gathered from these remarks that Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s reverence\r\nfor the stock of instruments was profound, and that his philosophy knew\r\nlittle or no distinction between trading in it and inventing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing to understand \xe2\x80\x99em. And\r\nyet it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing not to understand \xe2\x80\x99em. I hardly know which is\r\nbest. It\xe2\x80\x99s so comfortable to sit here and feel that you might be\r\nweighed, measured, magnified, electrified, polarized, played the very\r\ndevil with: and never know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing short of the wonderful Madeira, combined with the occasion\r\n(which rendered it desirable to improve and expand Walter\xe2\x80\x99s mind),\r\ncould have ever loosened his tongue to the extent of giving utterance\r\nto this prodigious oration. He seemed quite amazed himself at the\r\nmanner in which it opened up to view the sources of the taciturn\r\ndelight he had had in eating Sunday dinners in that parlour for ten\r\nyears. Becoming a sadder and a wiser man, he mused and held his peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the subject of this admiration, returning. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore you\r\nhave your glass of grog, Ned, we must finish the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned, filling his glass. \xe2\x80\x9cGive the boy some more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more, thank\xe2\x80\x99e, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sol, \xe2\x80\x9ca little more. We\xe2\x80\x99ll finish the bottle, to the\r\nHouse, Ned\xe2\x80\x94Walter\xe2\x80\x99s House. Why it may be his House one of these days,\r\nin part. Who knows? Sir Richard Whittington married his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, and when you are old\r\nyou will never depart from it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\r\nOverhaul the book, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd although Mr Dombey hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d Sol began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, he has, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, reddening and laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I think he has too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know he has,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of \xe2\x80\x99em were talking about it\r\nin the office today. And they do say, Uncle and Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a dislike to her, and that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft, unnoticed, among the servants, and that his mind\xe2\x80\x99s so set all the\r\nwhile upon having his son in the House, that although he\xe2\x80\x99s only a baby\r\nnow, he is going to have balances struck oftener than formerly, and the\r\nbooks kept closer than they used to be, and has even been seen (when he\r\nthought he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t) walking in the Docks, looking at his ships and\r\nproperty and all that, as if he was exulting like, over what he and his\r\nson will possess together. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they say. Of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows all about her already, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the instrument-maker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy, still reddening and laughing,\r\nboy-like. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help hearing what they tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe son\xe2\x80\x99s a little in our way at present, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold man, humouring the joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, we\xe2\x80\x99ll drink him,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, here\xe2\x80\x99s to Dombey and\r\nSon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cSince you have\r\nintroduced the mention of her, and have connected me with her and have\r\nsaid that I know all about her, I shall make bold to amend the toast.\r\nSo here\xe2\x80\x99s to Dombey\xe2\x80\x94and Son\xe2\x80\x94and Daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Progress and Christening\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Paul, suffering no contamination from the blood of the Toodles,\r\ngrew stouter and stronger every day. Every day, too, he was more and\r\nmore ardently cherished by Miss Tox, whose devotion was so far\r\nappreciated by Mr Dombey that he began to regard her as a woman of\r\ngreat natural good sense, whose feelings did her credit and deserved\r\nencouragement. He was so lavish of this condescension, that he not only\r\nbowed to her, in a particular manner, on several occasions, but even\r\nentrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as \xe2\x80\x9cpray tell\r\nyour friend, Louisa, that she is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmention to Miss Tox,\r\nLouisa, that I am obliged to her;\xe2\x80\x9d specialities which made a deep\r\nimpression on the lady thus distinguished.\r\n\r\nWhether Miss Tox conceived that having been selected by the Fates to\r\nwelcome the little Dombey before he was born, in Kirby, Beard and\r\nKirby\xe2\x80\x99s Best Mixed Pins, it therefore naturally devolved upon her to\r\ngreet him with all other forms of welcome in all other early stages of\r\nhis existence\xe2\x80\x94or whether her overflowing goodness induced her to\r\nvolunteer into the domestic militia as a substitute in some sort for\r\nhis deceased Mama\xe2\x80\x94or whether she was conscious of any other motives\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nquestions which in this stage of the Firm\xe2\x80\x99s history herself only could\r\nhave solved. Nor have they much bearing on the fact (of which there is\r\nno doubt), that Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s constancy and zeal were a heavy\r\ndiscouragement to Richards, who lost flesh hourly under her patronage,\r\nand was in some danger of being superintended to death.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox was often in the habit of assuring Mrs Chick, that nothing\r\ncould exceed her interest in all connected with the development of that\r\nsweet child; and an observer of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings might have\r\ninferred so much without declaratory confirmation. She would preside\r\nover the innocent repasts of the young heir, with ineffable\r\nsatisfaction, almost with an air of joint proprietorship with Richards\r\nin the entertainment. At the little ceremonies of the bath and\r\ntoilette, she assisted with enthusiasm. The administration of infantine\r\ndoses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character; and\r\nbeing on one occasion secreted in a cupboard (whither she had fled in\r\nmodesty), when Mr Dombey was introduced into the nursery by his sister,\r\nto behold his son, in the course of preparation for bed, taking a short\r\nwalk uphill over Richards\xe2\x80\x99s gown, in a short and airy linen jacket,\r\nMiss Tox was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable\r\nto refrain from crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cIs he not beautiful Mr Dombey! Is he not a\r\nCupid, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and then almost sinking behind the closet door with\r\nconfusion and blushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, one day, to his sister, \xe2\x80\x9cI really think I\r\nmust present your friend with some little token, on the occasion of\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s christening. She has exerted herself so warmly in the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehalf from the first, and seems to understand her position so\r\nthoroughly (a very rare merit in this world, I am sorry to say), that\r\nit would really be agreeable to me to notice her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLet it be no detraction from the merits of Miss Tox, to hint that in Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as in some others that occasionally see the light, they\r\nonly achieved that mighty piece of knowledge, the understanding of\r\ntheir own position, who showed a fitting reverence for his. It was not\r\nso much their merit that they knew themselves, as that they knew him,\r\nand bowed low before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his sister, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do Miss Tox but justice, as a\r\nman of your penetration was sure, I knew, to do. I believe if there are\r\nthree words in the English language for which she has a respect\r\namounting almost to veneration, those words are, Dombey and Son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it. It does Miss Tox credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as to anything in the shape of a token, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued his\r\nsister, \xe2\x80\x9call I can say is that anything you give Miss Tox will be\r\nhoarded and prized, I am sure, like a relic. But there is a way, my\r\ndear Paul, of showing your sense of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s friendliness in a still\r\nmore flattering and acceptable manner, if you should be so inclined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfathers, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9care important in point\r\nof connexion and influence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they should be, to my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick, with an extraordinary\r\nshow of animation, to cover the suddenness of her conversion; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nspoken like yourself. I might have expected nothing else from you. I\r\nmight have known that such would have been your opinion. Perhaps;\xe2\x80\x9d here\r\nMrs Chick faltered again, as not quite comfortably feeling her way;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that is a reason why you might have the less objection to\r\nallowing Miss Tox to be godmother to the dear thing, if it were only as\r\ndeputy and proxy for someone else. That it would be received as a great\r\nhonour and distinction, Paul, I need not say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not to be\r\nsupposed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Chick, hastening to anticipate a refusal, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever thought it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey looked at her impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t flurry me, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister; \xe2\x80\x9cfor that destroys\r\nme. I am far from strong. I have not been quite myself, since poor dear\r\nFanny departed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey glanced at the pocket-handkerchief which his sister applied\r\nto her eyes, and resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not be supposed, I say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I never thought it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven, Louisa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d she remonstrated with tearful dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nreally be allowed to speak. I am not so clever, or so reasoning, or so\r\neloquent, or so anything, as you are. I know that very well. So much\r\nthe worse for me. But if they were the last words I had to utter\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nlast words should be very solemn to you and me, Paul, after poor dear\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x94I would still say I never thought it was. And what is more,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Mrs Chick with increased dignity, as if she had withheld her\r\ncrushing argument until now, \xe2\x80\x9cI never did think it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey walked to the window and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to be supposed, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said (Mrs Chick had nailed her\r\ncolours to the mast, and repeated \xe2\x80\x9cI know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d but he took no\r\nnotice of it), \xe2\x80\x9cbut that there are many persons who, supposing that I\r\nrecognised any claim at all in such a case, have a claim upon me\r\nsuperior to Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s. But I do not. I recognise no such thing. Paul\r\nand myself will be able, when the time comes, to hold our own\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nHouse, in other words, will be able to hold its own, and maintain its\r\nown, and hand down its own of itself, and without any such common-place\r\naids. The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their\r\nchildren, I can afford to despise; being above it, I hope. So that\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s infancy and childhood pass away well, and I see him becoming\r\nqualified without waste of time for the career on which he is destined\r\nto enter, I am satisfied. He will make what powerful friends he pleases\r\nin after-life, when he is actively maintaining\xe2\x80\x94and extending, if that\r\nis possible\xe2\x80\x94the dignity and credit of the Firm. Until then, I am enough\r\nfor him, perhaps, and all in all. I have no wish that people should\r\nstep in between us. I would much rather show my sense of the obliging\r\nconduct of a deserving person like your friend. Therefore let it be so;\r\nand your husband and myself will do well enough for the other sponsors,\r\nI daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the course of these remarks, delivered with great majesty and\r\ngrandeur, Mr Dombey had truly revealed the secret feelings of his\r\nbreast. An indescribable distrust of anybody stepping in between\r\nhimself and his son; a haughty dread of having any rival or partner in\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s respect and deference; a sharp misgiving, recently acquired,\r\nthat he was not infallible in his power of bending and binding human\r\nwills; as sharp a jealousy of any second check or cross; these were, at\r\nthat time the master keys of his soul. In all his life, he had never\r\nmade a friend. His cold and distant nature had neither sought one, nor\r\nfound one. And now, when that nature concentrated its whole force so\r\nstrongly on a partial scheme of parental interest and ambition, it\r\nseemed as if its icy current, instead of being released by this\r\ninfluence, and running clear and free, had thawed for but an instant to\r\nadmit its burden, and then frozen with it into one unyielding block.\r\n\r\nElevated thus to the godmothership of little Paul, in virtue of her\r\ninsignificance, Miss Tox was from that hour chosen and appointed to\r\noffice; and Mr Dombey further signified his pleasure that the ceremony,\r\nalready long delayed, should take place without further postponement.\r\nHis sister, who had been far from anticipating so signal a success,\r\nwithdrew as soon as she could, to communicate it to her best of\r\nfriends; and Mr Dombey was left alone in his library. He had already\r\nlaid his hand upon the bellrope to convey his usual summons to\r\nRichards, when his eye fell upon a writing-desk, belonging to his\r\ndeceased wife, which had been taken, among other things, from a cabinet\r\nin her chamber. It was not the first time that his eye had lighted on\r\nit He carried the key in his pocket; and he brought it to his table and\r\nopened it now\xe2\x80\x94having previously locked the room door\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nwell-accustomed hand.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper, he took one\r\nletter that remained entire. Involuntarily holding his breath as he\r\nopened this document, and \xe2\x80\x9cbating in the stealthy action something of\r\nhis arrogant demeanour, he sat down, resting his head upon one hand,\r\nand read it through.\r\n\r\nHe read it slowly and attentively, and with a nice particularity to\r\nevery syllable. Otherwise than as his great deliberation seemed\r\nunnatural, and perhaps the result of an effort equally great, he\r\nallowed no sign of emotion to escape him. When he had read it through,\r\nhe folded and refolded it slowly several times, and tore it carefully\r\ninto fragments. Checking his hand in the act of throwing these away, he\r\nput them in his pocket, as if unwilling to trust them even to the\r\nchances of being re-united and deciphered; and instead of ringing, as\r\nusual, for little Paul, he sat solitary, all the evening, in his\r\ncheerless room.\r\n\r\nThere was anything but solitude in the nursery; for there, Mrs Chick\r\nand Miss Tox were enjoying a social evening, so much to the disgust of\r\nMiss Susan Nipper, that that young lady embraced every opportunity of\r\nmaking wry faces behind the door. Her feelings were so much excited on\r\nthe occasion, that she found it indispensable to afford them this\r\nrelief, even without having the comfort of any audience or sympathy\r\nwhatever. As the knight-errants of old relieved their minds by carving\r\ntheir mistress\xe2\x80\x99s names in deserts, and wildernesses, and other savage\r\nplaces where there was no probability of there ever being anybody to\r\nread them, so did Miss Susan Nipper curl her snub nose into drawers and\r\nwardrobes, put away winks of disparagement in cupboards, shed derisive\r\nsquints into stone pitchers, and contradict and call names out in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe two interlopers, however, blissfully unconscious of the young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments, saw little Paul safe through all the stages of\r\nundressing, airy exercise, supper and bed; and then sat down to tea\r\nbefore the fire. The two children now lay, through the good offices of\r\nPolly, in one room; and it was not until the ladies were established at\r\ntheir tea-table that, happening to look towards the little beds, they\r\nthought of Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sound she sleeps!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know, my dear, she takes a great deal of exercise in the\r\ncourse of the day,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cplaying about little Paul so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a curious child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick, in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHer Mama, all over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn-deed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cAh dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tone of most extraordinary compassion Miss Tox said it in, though she\r\nhad no distinct idea why, except that it was expected of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence will never, never, never be a Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nif she lives to be a thousand years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox elevated her eyebrows, and was again full of commiseration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite fret and worry myself about her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with a sigh\r\nof modest merit. \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t see what is to become of her when she\r\ngrows older, or what position she is to take. She don\xe2\x80\x99t gain on her\r\nPapa in the least. How can one expect she should, when she is so very\r\nunlike a Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox looked as if she saw no way out of such a cogent argument as\r\nthat, at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the child, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, in deep confidence, \xe2\x80\x9chas poor\r\ndear Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s nature. She\xe2\x80\x99ll never make an effort in after-life, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nventure to say. Never! She\xe2\x80\x99ll never wind and twine herself about her\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s heart like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the ivy?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the ivy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Chick assented. \xe2\x80\x9cNever! She\xe2\x80\x99ll never glide and\r\nnestle into the bosom of her Papa\xe2\x80\x99s affections like\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStartled fawn?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the startled fawn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cNever! Poor Fanny! Yet, how\r\nI loved her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not distress yourself, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, in a soothing\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cNow really! You have too much feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have all our faults,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, weeping and shaking her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay we have. I never was blind to hers. I never said I was. Far\r\nfrom it. Yet how I loved her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a satisfaction it was to Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x94a common-place piece of folly\r\nenough, compared with whom her sister-in-law had been a very angel of\r\nwomanly intelligence and gentleness\xe2\x80\x94to patronise and be tender to the\r\nmemory of that lady: in exact pursuance of her conduct to her in her\r\nlifetime: and to thoroughly believe herself, and take herself in, and\r\nmake herself uncommonly comfortable on the strength of her toleration!\r\nWhat a mighty pleasant virtue toleration should be when we are right,\r\nto be so very pleasant when we are wrong, and quite unable to\r\ndemonstrate how we come to be invested with the privilege of exercising\r\nit!\r\n\r\nMrs Chick was yet drying her eyes and shaking her head, when Richards\r\nmade bold to caution her that Miss Florence was awake and sitting in\r\nher bed. She had risen, as the nurse said, and the lashes of her eyes\r\nwere wet with tears. But no one saw them glistening save Polly. No one\r\nelse leant over her, and whispered soothing words to her, or was near\r\nenough to hear the flutter of her beating heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear nurse!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, looking earnestly up in her face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet me lie by my brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my pet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I think he loves me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the child wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me lie by him.\r\nPray do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick interposed with some motherly words about going to sleep like\r\na dear, but Florence repeated her supplication, with a frightened look,\r\nand in a voice broken by sobs and tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not wake him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, covering her face and hanging down her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only touch him with my hand, and go to sleep. Oh, pray,\r\npray, let me lie by my brother tonight, for I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s fond of\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards took her without a word, and carrying her to the little bed in\r\nwhich the infant was sleeping, laid her down by his side. She crept as\r\nnear him as she could without disturbing his rest; and stretching out\r\none arm so that it timidly embraced his neck, and hiding her face on\r\nthe other, over which her damp and scattered hair fell loose, lay\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has been dreaming, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDreaming, perhaps, of loving tones for ever silent, of loving eyes for\r\never closed, of loving arms again wound round her, and relaxing in that\r\ndream within the dam which no tongue can relate. Seeking, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94in\r\ndreams\xe2\x80\x94some natural comfort for a heart, deeply and sorely wounded,\r\nthough so young a child\xe2\x80\x99s: and finding it, perhaps, in dreams, if not\r\nin waking, cold, substantial truth. This trivial incident had so\r\ninterrupted the current of conversation, that it was difficult of\r\nresumption; and Mrs Chick moreover had been so affected by the\r\ncontemplation of her own tolerant nature, that she was not in spirits.\r\nThe two friends accordingly soon made an end of their tea, and a\r\nservant was despatched to fetch a hackney cabriolet for Miss Tox. Miss\r\nTox had great experience in hackney cabs, and her starting in one was\r\ngenerally a work of time, as she was systematic in the preparatory\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the goodness, if you please, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst of\r\nall, to carry out a pen and ink and take his number legibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if you please, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9chave the goodness to\r\nturn the cushion. Which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox apart to Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\ngenerally damp, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you also, if you please, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\nthis card and this shilling. He\xe2\x80\x99s to drive to the card, and is to\r\nunderstand that he will not on any account have more than the\r\nshilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to give you so much trouble, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox,\r\nlooking at him pensively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMention to the man, then, if you please, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the lady\xe2\x80\x99s uncle is a magistrate, and that if he gives her any of\r\nhis impertinence he will be punished terribly. You can pretend to say\r\nthat, if you please, Towlinson, in a friendly way, and because you know\r\nit was done to another man, who died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now good-night to my sweet, sweet, sweet, godson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox,\r\nwith a soft shower of kisses at each repetition of the adjective; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nLouisa, my dear friend, promise me to take a little something warm\r\nbefore you go to bed, and not to distress yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with extreme difficulty that Nipper, the black-eyed, who looked\r\non steadfastly, contained herself at this crisis, and until the\r\nsubsequent departure of Mrs Chick. But the nursery being at length free\r\nof visitors, she made herself some recompense for her late restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might keep me in a strait-waistcoat for six weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nipper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand when I got it off I\xe2\x80\x99d only be more aggravated, who ever heard the\r\nlike of them two Griffins, Mrs Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then to talk of having been dreaming, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you beauties!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan Nipper, affecting to salute the door by\r\nwhich the ladies had departed. \xe2\x80\x9cNever be a Dombey won\xe2\x80\x99t she? It\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\nhoped she won\xe2\x80\x99t, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more such, one\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wake the children, Susan dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much beholden to you, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, who was not\r\nby any means discriminating in her wrath, \xe2\x80\x9cand really feel it as a\r\nhonour to receive your commands, being a black slave and a mulotter.\r\nMrs Richards, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any other orders, you can give me, pray\r\nmention \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense; orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! bless your heart, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, \xe2\x80\x9ctemporaries always\r\norders permanencies here, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that, why wherever was you\r\nborn, Mrs Richards? But wherever you was born, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nSpitfire, shaking her head resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cand whenever, and however\r\n(which is best known to yourself), you may bear in mind, please, that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to give orders, and quite another thing to take \xe2\x80\x99em. A\r\nperson may tell a person to dive off a bridge head foremost into\r\nfive-and-forty feet of water, Mrs Richards, but a person may be very\r\nfar from diving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re angry because you\xe2\x80\x99re a good little\r\nthing, and fond of Miss Florence; and yet you turn round on me, because\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very easy for some to keep their tempers, and be soft-spoken, Mrs\r\nRichards,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan, slightly mollified, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen their child\xe2\x80\x99s made\r\nas much of as a prince, and is petted and patted till it wishes its\r\nfriends further, but when a sweet young pretty innocent, that never\r\nought to have a cross word spoken to or of it, is rundown, the case is\r\nvery different indeed. My goodness gracious me, Miss Floy, you naughty,\r\nsinful child, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t shut your eyes this minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call in\r\nthem hobgoblins that lives in the cock-loft to come and eat you up\r\nalive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Miss Nipper made a horrible lowing, supposed to issue from a\r\nconscientious goblin of the bull species, impatient to discharge the\r\nsevere duty of his position. Having further composed her young charge\r\nby covering her head with the bedclothes, and making three or four\r\nangry dabs at the pillow, she folded her arms, and screwed up her\r\nmouth, and sat looking at the fire for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nThough little Paul was said, in nursery phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cto take a deal of\r\nnotice for his age,\xe2\x80\x9d he took as little notice of all this as of the\r\npreparations for his christening on the next day but one; which\r\nnevertheless went on about him, as to his personal apparel, and that of\r\nhis sister and the two nurses, with great activity. Neither did he, on\r\nthe arrival of the appointed morning, show any sense of its importance;\r\nbeing, on the contrary, unusually inclined to sleep, and unusually\r\ninclined to take it ill in his attendants that they dressed him to go\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be an iron-grey autumnal day, with a shrewd east wind\r\nblowing\xe2\x80\x94a day in keeping with the proceedings. Mr Dombey represented in\r\nhimself the wind, the shade, and the autumn of the christening. He\r\nstood in his library to receive the company, as hard and cold as the\r\nweather; and when he looked out through the glass room, at the trees in\r\nthe little garden, their brown and yellow leaves came fluttering down,\r\nas if he blighted them.\r\n\r\nUgh! They were black, cold rooms; and seemed to be in mourning, like\r\nthe inmates of the house. The books precisely matched as to size, and\r\ndrawn up in line, like soldiers, looked in their cold, hard, slippery\r\nuniforms, as if they had but one idea among them, and that was a\r\nfreezer. The bookcase, glazed and locked, repudiated all familiarities.\r\nMr Pitt, in bronze, on the top, with no trace of his celestial origin\r\nabout him, guarded the unattainable treasure like an enchanted Moor. A\r\ndusty urn at each high corner, dug up from an ancient tomb, preached\r\ndesolation and decay, as from two pulpits; and the chimney-glass,\r\nreflecting Mr Dombey and his portrait at one blow, seemed fraught with\r\nmelancholy meditations.\r\n\r\nThe stiff and stark fire-irons appeared to claim a nearer relationship\r\nthan anything else there to Mr Dombey, with his buttoned coat, his\r\nwhite cravat, his heavy gold watch-chain, and his creaking boots. But\r\nthis was before the arrival of Mr and Mrs Chick, his lawful relatives,\r\nwho soon presented themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Chick murmured, as she embraced him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nbeginning, I hope, of many joyful days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mr John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chick.\r\n\r\nHe gave Mr Dombey his hand, as if he feared it might electrify him. Mr\r\nDombey took it as if it were a fish, or seaweed, or some such clammy\r\nsubstance, and immediately returned it to him with exalted politeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, slightly turning his head in his\r\ncravat, as if it were a socket, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have preferred a fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear Paul, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, who had much ado to keep her\r\nteeth from chattering; \xe2\x80\x9cnot for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not sensible of any chill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr John, who had already got both his hands in his pockets over the\r\nwrists, and was on the very threshold of that same canine chorus which\r\nhad given Mrs Chick so much offence on a former occasion, protested\r\nthat he was perfectly comfortable.\r\n\r\nHe added in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWith my tiddle tol toor rul\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when he was\r\nprovidentially stopped by Towlinson, who announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd enter that fair enslaver, with a blue nose and indescribably frosty\r\nface, referable to her being very thinly clad in a maze of fluttering\r\nodds and ends, to do honour to the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Miss Tox?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, in the midst of her spreading gauzes, went down altogether\r\nlike an opera-glass shutting-up; she curtseyed so low, in\r\nacknowledgment of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s advancing a step or two to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can never forget this occasion, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, softly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nimpossible. My dear Louisa, I can hardly believe the evidence of my\r\nsenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Miss Tox could believe the evidence of one of her senses, it was a\r\nvery cold day. That was quite clear. She took an early opportunity of\r\npromoting the circulation in the tip of her nose by secretly chafing it\r\nwith her pocket handkerchief, lest, by its very low temperature, it\r\nshould disagreeably astonish the baby when she came to kiss it.\r\n\r\nThe baby soon appeared, carried in great glory by Richards; while\r\nFlorence, in custody of that active young constable, Susan Nipper,\r\nbrought up the rear. Though the whole nursery party were dressed by\r\nthis time in lighter mourning than at first, there was enough in the\r\nappearance of the bereaved children to make the day no brighter. The\r\nbaby too\xe2\x80\x94it might have been Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s nose\xe2\x80\x94began to cry. Thereby, as\r\nit happened, preventing Mr Chick from the awkward fulfilment of a very\r\nhonest purpose he had; which was, to make much of Florence. For this\r\ngentleman, insensible to the superior claims of a perfect Dombey\r\n(perhaps on account of having the honour to be united to a Dombey\r\nhimself, and being familiar with excellence), really liked her, and\r\nshowed that he liked her, and was about to show it in his own way now,\r\nwhen Paul cried, and his helpmate stopped him short\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Florence, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt, briskly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you doing,\r\nlove? Show yourself to him. Engage his attention, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere became or might have become colder and colder, when Mr\r\nDombey stood frigidly watching his little daughter, who, clapping her\r\nhands, and standing on tip-toe before the throne of his son and heir,\r\nlured him to bend down from his high estate, and look at her. Some\r\nhonest act of Richards\xe2\x80\x99s may have aided the effect, but he did look\r\ndown, and held his peace. As his sister hid behind her nurse, he\r\nfollowed her with his eyes; and when she peeped out with a merry cry to\r\nhim, he sprang up and crowed lustily\xe2\x80\x94laughing outright when she ran in\r\nupon him; and seeming to fondle her curls with his tiny hands, while\r\nshe smothered him with kisses.\r\n\r\nWas Mr Dombey pleased to see this? He testified no pleasure by the\r\nrelaxation of a nerve; but outward tokens of any kind of feeling were\r\nunusual with him. If any sunbeam stole into the room to light the\r\nchildren at their play, it never reached his face. He looked on so\r\nfixedly and coldly, that the warm light vanished even from the laughing\r\neyes of little Florence, when, at last, they happened to meet his.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, grey, autumn day indeed, and in a minute\xe2\x80\x99s pause and\r\nsilence that took place, the leaves fell sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, referring to his watch, and assuming his hat\r\nand gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my sister, if you please: my arm today is Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nYou had better go first with Master Paul, Richards. Be very careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, Dombey and Son, Miss Tox, Mrs Chick, Richards,\r\nand Florence. In a little carriage following it, Susan Nipper and the\r\nowner Mr Chick. Susan looking out of window, without intermission, as a\r\nrelief from the embarrassment of confronting the large face of that\r\ngentleman, and thinking whenever anything rattled that he was putting\r\nup in paper an appropriate pecuniary compliment for herself.\r\n\r\nOnce upon the road to church, Mr Dombey clapped his hands for the\r\namusement of his son. At which instance of parental enthusiasm Miss Tox\r\nwas enchanted. But exclusive of this incident, the chief difference\r\nbetween the christening party and a party in a mourning coach consisted\r\nin the colours of the carriage and horses.\r\n\r\nArrived at the church steps, they were received by a portentous beadle.\r\nMr Dombey dismounting first to help the ladies out, and standing near\r\nhim at the church door, looked like another beadle. A beadle less\r\ngorgeous but more dreadful; the beadle of private life; the beadle of\r\nour business and our bosoms.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s hand trembled as she slipped it through Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and\r\nfelt herself escorted up the steps, preceded by a cocked hat and a\r\nBabylonian collar. It seemed for a moment like that other solemn\r\ninstitution, \xe2\x80\x9cWilt thou have this man, Lucretia?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to bring the child in quick out of the air there,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nthe beadle, holding open the inner door of the church.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul might have asked with Hamlet \xe2\x80\x9cinto my grave?\xe2\x80\x9d so chill and\r\nearthy was the place. The tall, shrouded pulpit and reading desk; the\r\ndreary perspective of empty pews stretching away under the galleries,\r\nand empty benches mounting to the roof and lost in the shadow of the\r\ngreat grim organ; the dusty matting and cold stone slabs; the grisly\r\nfree seats in the aisles; and the damp corner by the bell-rope, where\r\nthe black trestles used for funerals were stowed away, along with some\r\nshovels and baskets, and a coil or two of deadly-looking rope; the\r\nstrange, unusual, uncomfortable smell, and the cadaverous light; were\r\nall in unison. It was a cold and dismal scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a wedding just on, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99ll be over\r\ndirectly, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll walk into the westry here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he turned again to lead the way, he gave Mr Dombey a bow and a\r\nhalf smile of recognition, importing that he (the beadle) remembered to\r\nhave had the pleasure of attending on him when he buried his wife, and\r\nhoped he had enjoyed himself since.\r\n\r\nThe very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar.\r\nThe bride was too old and the bridegroom too young, and a superannuated\r\nbeau with one eye and an eyeglass stuck in its blank companion, was\r\ngiving away the lady, while the friends were shivering. In the vestry\r\nthe fire was smoking; and an over-aged and over-worked and under-paid\r\nattorney\xe2\x80\x99s clerk, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking a search,\xe2\x80\x9d was running his forefinger down\r\nthe parchment pages of an immense register (one of a long series of\r\nsimilar volumes) gorged with burials. Over the fireplace was a\r\nground-plan of the vaults underneath the church; and Mr Chick, skimming\r\nthe literary portion of it aloud, by way of enlivening the company,\r\nread the reference to Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s tomb in full, before he could stop\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAfter another cold interval, a wheezy little pew-opener afflicted with\r\nan asthma, appropriate to the churchyard, if not to the church,\r\nsummoned them to the font\xe2\x80\x94a rigid marble basin which seemed to have\r\nbeen playing a churchyard game at cup and ball with its matter of fact\r\npedestal, and to have been just that moment caught on the top of it.\r\nHere they waited some little time while the marriage party enrolled\r\nthemselves; and meanwhile the wheezy little pew-opener\xe2\x80\x94partly in\r\nconsequence of her infirmity, and partly that the marriage party might\r\nnot forget her\xe2\x80\x94went about the building coughing like a grampus.\r\n\r\nPresently the clerk (the only cheerful-looking object there, and he was\r\nan undertaker) came up with a jug of warm water, and said something, as\r\nhe poured it into the font, about taking the chill off; which millions\r\nof gallons boiling hot could not have done for the occasion. Then the\r\nclergyman, an amiable and mild-looking young curate, but obviously\r\nafraid of the baby, appeared like the principal character in a\r\nghost-story, \xe2\x80\x9ca tall figure all in white;\xe2\x80\x9d at sight of whom Paul rent\r\nthe air with his cries, and never left off again till he was taken out\r\nblack in the face.\r\n\r\nEven when that event had happened, to the great relief of everybody, he\r\nwas heard under the portico, during the rest of the ceremony, now\r\nfainter, now louder, now hushed, now bursting forth again with an\r\nirrepressible sense of his wrongs. This so distracted the attention of\r\nthe two ladies, that Mrs Chick was constantly deploying into the centre\r\naisle, to send out messages by the pew-opener, while Miss Tox kept her\r\nPrayer-book open at the Gunpowder Plot, and occasionally read responses\r\nfrom that service.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of these proceedings, Mr Dombey remained as impassive\r\nand gentlemanly as ever, and perhaps assisted in making it so cold,\r\nthat the young curate smoked at the mouth as he read. The only time\r\nthat he unbent his visage in the least, was when the clergyman, in\r\ndelivering (very unaffectedly and simply) the closing exhortation,\r\nrelative to the future examination of the child by the sponsors,\r\nhappened to rest his eye on Mr Chick; and then Mr Dombey might have\r\nbeen seen to express by a majestic look, that he would like to catch\r\nhim at it.\r\n\r\nIt might have been well for Mr Dombey, if he had thought of his own\r\ndignity a little less; and had thought of the great origin and purpose\r\nof the ceremony in which he took so formal and so stiff a part, a\r\nlittle more. His arrogance contrasted strangely with its history.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, he again gave his arm to Miss Tox, and conducted\r\nher to the vestry, where he informed the clergyman how much pleasure it\r\nwould have given him to have solicited the honour of his company at\r\ndinner, but for the unfortunate state of his household affairs. The\r\nregister signed, and the fees paid, and the pew-opener (whose cough was\r\nvery bad again) remembered, and the beadle gratified, and the sexton\r\n(who was accidentally on the doorsteps, looking with great interest at\r\nthe weather) not forgotten, they got into the carriage again, and drove\r\nhome in the same bleak fellowship.\r\n\r\nThere they found Mr Pitt turning up his nose at a cold collation, set\r\nforth in a cold pomp of glass and silver, and looking more like a dead\r\ndinner lying in state than a social refreshment. On their arrival Miss\r\nTox produced a mug for her godson, and Mr Chick a knife and fork and\r\nspoon in a case. Mr Dombey also produced a bracelet for Miss Tox; and,\r\non the receipt of this token, Miss Tox was tenderly affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you take the bottom of the table, if\r\nyou please? What have you got there, Mr John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a cold fillet of veal here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Chick, rubbing\r\nhis numbed hands hard together. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got there, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cis some cold preparation of calf\xe2\x80\x99s head, I\r\nthink. I see cold fowls\xe2\x80\x94ham\xe2\x80\x94patties\xe2\x80\x94salad\xe2\x80\x94lobster. Miss Tox will do me\r\nthe honour of taking some wine? Champagne to Miss Tox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a toothache in everything. The wine was so bitter cold that\r\nit forced a little scream from Miss Tox, which she had great difficulty\r\nin turning into a \xe2\x80\x9cHem!\xe2\x80\x9d The veal had come from such an airy pantry,\r\nthat the first taste of it had struck a sensation as of cold lead to Mr\r\nChick\xe2\x80\x99s extremities. Mr Dombey alone remained unmoved. He might have\r\nbeen hung up for sale at a Russian fair as a specimen of a frozen\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing influence was too much even for his sister. She made no\r\neffort at flattery or small talk, and directed all her efforts to\r\nlooking as warm as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick, making a desperate plunge, after a long\r\nsilence, and filling a glass of sherry; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall drink this, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nallow me, Sir, to little Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless him!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Miss Tox, taking a sip of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with severe gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cmy son would feel and\r\nexpress himself obliged to you, I have no doubt, if he could appreciate\r\nthe favour you have done him. He will prove, in time to come, I trust,\r\nequal to any responsibility that the obliging disposition of his\r\nrelations and friends, in private, or the onerous nature of our\r\nposition, in public, may impose upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this was said admitting of nothing more, Mr Chick\r\nrelapsed into low spirits and silence. Not so Miss Tox, who, having\r\nlistened to Mr Dombey with even a more emphatic attention than usual,\r\nand with a more expressive tendency of her head to one side, now leant\r\nacross the table, and said to Mrs Chick softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnerous nature of our position in public may\xe2\x80\x94I have forgotten the\r\nexact term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpose him to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI think not. It was more\r\nrounded and flowing. Obliging disposition of relations and friends in\r\nprivate, or onerous nature of position in public\xe2\x80\x94may\xe2\x80\x94impose upon him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpose upon him, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox struck her delicate hands together lightly, in triumph; and\r\nadded, casting up her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9celoquence indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, in the meanwhile, had issued orders for the attendance of\r\nRichards, who now entered curtseying, but without the baby; Paul being\r\nasleep after the fatigues of the morning. Mr Dombey, having delivered a\r\nglass of wine to this vassal, addressed her in the following words:\r\nMiss Tox previously settling her head on one side, and making other\r\nlittle arrangements for engraving them on her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the six months or so, Richards, which have seen you an inmate\r\nof this house, you have done your duty. Desiring to connect some little\r\nservice to you with this occasion, I considered how I could best effect\r\nthat object, and I also advised with my sister, Mrs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChick,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the gentleman of that name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hush if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to say to you, Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr Dombey, with an\r\nappalling glance at Mr John, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was further assisted in my\r\ndecision, by the recollection of a conversation I held with your\r\nhusband in this room, on the occasion of your being hired, when he\r\ndisclosed to me the melancholy fact that your family, himself at the\r\nhead, were sunk and steeped in ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards quailed under the magnificence of the reproof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far from being friendly,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cto what is called\r\nby persons of levelling sentiments, general education. But it is\r\nnecessary that the inferior classes should continue to be taught to\r\nknow their position, and to conduct themselves properly. So far I\r\napprove of schools. Having the power of nominating a child on the\r\nfoundation of an ancient establishment, called (from a worshipful\r\ncompany) the Charitable Grinders; where not only is a wholesome\r\neducation bestowed upon the scholars, but where a dress and badge is\r\nlikewise provided for them; I have (first communicating, through Mrs\r\nChick, with your family) nominated your eldest son to an existing\r\nvacancy; and he has this day, I am informed, assumed the habit. The\r\nnumber of her son, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, turning to his sister\r\nand speaking of the child as if he were a hackney-coach, is one hundred\r\nand forty-seven. Louisa, you can tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and forty-seven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick \xe2\x80\x9cThe dress, Richards, is\r\na nice, warm, blue baize tailed coat and cap, turned up with orange\r\ncoloured binding; red worsted stockings; and very strong leather\r\nsmall-clothes. One might wear the articles one\xe2\x80\x99s self,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick,\r\nwith enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cand be grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Richards!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, indeed, you may be proud. The\r\nCharitable Grinders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am very much obliged, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Richards faintly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand take it very kind that you should remember my little ones.\xe2\x80\x9d At the\r\nsame time a vision of Biler as a Charitable Grinder, with his very\r\nsmall legs encased in the serviceable clothing described by Mrs Chick,\r\nswam before Richards\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and made them water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to see you have so much feeling, Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nTox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes one almost hope, it really does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, who prided\r\nherself on taking trustful views of human nature, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there may yet\r\nbe some faint spark of gratitude and right feeling in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards deferred to these compliments by curtseying and murmuring her\r\nthanks; but finding it quite impossible to recover her spirits from the\r\ndisorder into which they had been thrown by the image of her son in his\r\nprecocious nether garments, she gradually approached the door and was\r\nheartily relieved to escape by it.\r\n\r\nSuch temporary indications of a partial thaw that had appeared with\r\nher, vanished with her; and the frost set in again, as cold and hard as\r\never. Mr Chick was twice heard to hum a tune at the bottom of the\r\ntable, but on both occasions it was a fragment of the Dead March in\r\nSaul. The party seemed to get colder and colder, and to be gradually\r\nresolving itself into a congealed and solid state, like the collation\r\nround which it was assembled. At length Mrs Chick looked at Miss Tox,\r\nand Miss Tox returned the look, and they both rose and said it was\r\nreally time to go. Mr Dombey receiving this announcement with perfect\r\nequanimity, they took leave of that gentleman, and presently departed\r\nunder the protection of Mr Chick; who, when they had turned their backs\r\nupon the house and left its master in his usual solitary state, put his\r\nhands in his pockets, threw himself back in the carriage, and whistled\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a hey ho chevy!\xe2\x80\x9d all through; conveying into his face as he did\r\nso, an expression of such gloomy and terrible defiance, that Mrs Chick\r\ndared not protest, or in any way molest him.\r\n\r\nRichards, though she had little Paul on her lap, could not forget her\r\nown first-born. She felt it was ungrateful; but the influence of the\r\nday fell even on the Charitable Grinders, and she could hardly help\r\nregarding his pewter badge, number one hundred and forty-seven, as,\r\nsomehow, a part of its formality and sternness. She spoke, too, in the\r\nnursery, of his \xe2\x80\x9cblessed legs,\xe2\x80\x9d and was again troubled by his spectre\r\nin uniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the poor\r\nlittle dear before he gets used to \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, I tell you what, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Nipper, who had\r\nbeen admitted to her confidence, \xe2\x80\x9csee him and make your mind easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mrs Richards!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d like it very\r\nmuch, I think when he was asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him, I suppose, at all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs Richards, quite contrairy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand them two\r\ninspectors Tox and Chick, not intending to be on duty tomorrow, as I\r\nheard \xe2\x80\x99em say, me and Miss Floy will go along with you tomorrow\r\nmorning, and welcome, Mrs Richards, if you like, for we may as well\r\nwalk there as up and down a street, and better too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly rejected the idea pretty stoutly at first; but by little and\r\nlittle she began to entertain it, as she entertained more and more\r\ndistinctly the forbidden pictures of her children, and her own home. At\r\nlength, arguing that there could be no great harm in calling for a\r\nmoment at the door, she yielded to the Nipper proposition.\r\n\r\nThe matter being settled thus, little Paul began to cry most piteously,\r\nas if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the child?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s cold, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, walking with him to and fro, and\r\nhushing him.\r\n\r\nIt was a bleak autumnal afternoon indeed; and as she walked, and\r\nhushed, and, glancing through the dreary windows, pressed the little\r\nfellow closer to her breast, the withered leaves came showering down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Second Deprivation\r\n\r\n\r\nPolly was beset by so many misgivings in the morning, that but for the\r\nincessant promptings of her black-eyed companion, she would have\r\nabandoned all thoughts of the expedition, and formally petitioned for\r\nleave to see number one hundred and forty-seven, under the awful shadow\r\nof Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s roof. But Susan who was personally disposed in favour of\r\nthe excursion, and who (like Tony Lumpkin), if she could bear the\r\ndisappointments of other people with tolerable fortitude, could not\r\nabide to disappoint herself, threw so many ingenious doubts in the way\r\nof this second thought, and stimulated the original intention with so\r\nmany ingenious arguments, that almost as soon as Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s stately\r\nback was turned, and that gentleman was pursuing his daily road towards\r\nthe City, his unconscious son was on his way to Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens.\r\n\r\nThis euphonious locality was situated in a suburb, known by the\r\ninhabitants of Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens by the name of Camberling Town; a\r\ndesignation which the Strangers\xe2\x80\x99 Map of London, as printed (with a view\r\nto pleasant and commodious reference) on pocket handkerchiefs,\r\ncondenses, with some show of reason, into Camden Town. Hither the two\r\nnurses bent their steps, accompanied by their charges; Richards\r\ncarrying Paul, of course, and Susan leading little Florence by the\r\nhand, and giving her such jerks and pokes from time to time, as she\r\nconsidered it wholesome to administer.\r\n\r\nThe first shock of a great earthquake had, just at that period, rent\r\nthe whole neighbourhood to its centre. Traces of its course were\r\nvisible on every side. Houses were knocked down; streets broken through\r\nand stopped; deep pits and trenches dug in the ground; enormous heaps\r\nof earth and clay thrown up; buildings that were undermined and\r\nshaking, propped by great beams of wood. Here, a chaos of carts,\r\noverthrown and jumbled together, lay topsy-turvy at the bottom of a\r\nsteep unnatural hill; there, confused treasures of iron soaked and\r\nrusted in something that had accidentally become a pond. Everywhere\r\nwere bridges that led nowhere; thoroughfares that were wholly\r\nimpassable; Babel towers of chimneys, wanting half their height;\r\ntemporary wooden houses and enclosures, in the most unlikely\r\nsituations; carcases of ragged tenements, and fragments of unfinished\r\nwalls and arches, and piles of scaffolding, and wildernesses of bricks,\r\nand giant forms of cranes, and tripods straddling above nothing. There\r\nwere a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness, wildly\r\nmingled out of their places, upside down, burrowing in the earth,\r\naspiring in the air, mouldering in the water, and unintelligible as any\r\ndream. Hot springs and fiery eruptions, the usual attendants upon\r\nearthquakes, lent their contributions of confusion to the scene.\r\nBoiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls; whence, also,\r\nthe glare and roar of flames came issuing forth; and mounds of ashes\r\nblocked up rights of way, and wholly changed the law and custom of the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn short, the yet unfinished and unopened Railroad was in progress;\r\nand, from the very core of all this dire disorder, trailed smoothly\r\naway, upon its mighty course of civilisation and improvement.\r\n\r\nBut as yet, the neighbourhood was shy to own the Railroad. One or two\r\nbold speculators had projected streets; and one had built a little, but\r\nhad stopped among the mud and ashes to consider farther of it. A\r\nbran-new Tavern, redolent of fresh mortar and size, and fronting\r\nnothing at all, had taken for its sign The Railway Arms; but that might\r\nbe rash enterprise\xe2\x80\x94and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen. So,\r\nthe Excavators\xe2\x80\x99 House of Call had sprung up from a beer-shop; and the\r\nold-established Ham and Beef Shop had become the Railway Eating House,\r\nwith a roast leg of pork daily, through interested motives of a similar\r\nimmediate and popular description. Lodging-house keepers were\r\nfavourable in like manner; and for the like reasons were not to be\r\ntrusted. The general belief was very slow. There were frowzy fields,\r\nand cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens,\r\nand summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the\r\nRailway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of\r\nlobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded\r\ncabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places. Posts,\r\nand rails, and old cautions to trespassers, and backs of mean houses,\r\nand patches of wretched vegetation, stared it out of countenance.\r\nNothing was the better for it, or thought of being so. If the miserable\r\nwaste ground lying near it could have laughed, it would have laughed it\r\nto scorn, like many of the miserable neighbours.\r\n\r\nStaggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens was uncommonly incredulous. It was a little row of\r\nhouses, with little squalid patches of ground before them, fenced off\r\nwith old doors, barrel staves, scraps of tarpaulin, and dead bushes;\r\nwith bottomless tin kettles and exhausted iron fenders, thrust into the\r\ngaps. Here, the Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardeners trained scarlet beans, kept fowls\r\nand rabbits, erected rotten summer-houses (one was an old boat), dried\r\nclothes, and smoked pipes. Some were of opinion that Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens\r\nderived its name from a deceased capitalist, one Mr Staggs, who had\r\nbuilt it for his delectation. Others, who had a natural taste for the\r\ncountry, held that it dated from those rural times when the antlered\r\nherd, under the familiar denomination of Staggses, had resorted to its\r\nshady precincts. Be this as it may, Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens was regarded by\r\nits population as a sacred grove not to be withered by Railroads; and\r\nso confident were they generally of its long outliving any such\r\nridiculous inventions, that the master chimney-sweeper at the corner,\r\nwho was understood to take the lead in the local politics of the\r\nGardens, had publicly declared that on the occasion of the Railroad\r\nopening, if ever it did open, two of his boys should ascend the flues\r\nof his dwelling, with instructions to hail the failure with derisive\r\ncheers from the chimney-pots.\r\n\r\nTo this unhallowed spot, the very name of which had hitherto been\r\ncarefully concealed from Mr Dombey by his sister, was little Paul now\r\nborne by Fate and Richards\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my house, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, pointing it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it, indeed, Mrs Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s my sister Jemima at the door, I do declare\xe2\x80\x9d cried Polly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith my own sweet precious baby in her arms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sight added such an extensive pair of wings to Polly\xe2\x80\x99s impatience,\r\nthat she set off down the Gardens at a run, and bouncing on Jemima,\r\nchanged babies with her in a twinkling; to the unutterable astonishment\r\nof that young damsel, on whom the heir of the Dombeys seemed to have\r\nfallen from the clouds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Polly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jemima. \xe2\x80\x9cYou! what a turn you have given me! who\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave thought it! come along in Polly! How well you do look to be sure!\r\nThe children will go half wild to see you Polly, that they will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat they did, if one might judge from the noise they made, and the way\r\nin which they dashed at Polly and dragged her to a low chair in the\r\nchimney corner, where her own honest apple face became immediately the\r\ncentre of a bunch of smaller pippins, all laying their rosy cheeks\r\nclose to it, and all evidently the growth of the same tree. As to\r\nPolly, she was full as noisy and vehement as the children; and it was\r\nnot until she was quite out of breath, and her hair was hanging all\r\nabout her flushed face, and her new christening attire was very much\r\ndishevelled, that any pause took place in the confusion. Even then, the\r\nsmallest Toodle but one remained in her lap, holding on tight with both\r\narms round her neck; while the smallest Toodle but two mounted on the\r\nback of the chair, and made desperate efforts, with one leg in the air,\r\nto kiss her round the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty little lady come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsee how quiet she is! what a beautiful little lady, ain\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reference to Florence, who had been standing by the door not\r\nunobservant of what passed, directed the attention of the younger\r\nbranches towards her; and had likewise the happy effect of leading to\r\nthe formal recognition of Miss Nipper, who was not quite free from a\r\nmisgiving that she had been already slighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh do come in and sit down a minute, Susan, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis my sister Jemima, this is. Jemima, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should ever\r\ndo with myself, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Susan Nipper; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here now\r\nbut for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh do sit down, Miss Nipper, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Jemima.\r\n\r\nSusan took the extreme corner of a chair, with a stately and\r\nceremonious aspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was so glad to see anybody in all my life; now really I never\r\nwas, Miss Nipper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jemima.\r\n\r\nSusan relaxing, took a little more of the chair, and smiled graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo untie your bonnet-strings, and make yourself at home, Miss Nipper,\r\nplease,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Jemima. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s a poorer place than you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nused to; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll make allowances, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black-eyed was so softened by this deferential behaviour, that she\r\ncaught up little Miss Toodle who was running past, and took her to\r\nBanbury Cross immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x99s my pretty boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor fellow? I came all\r\nthis way to see him in his new clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jemima. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll break his heart, when he hears\r\nhis mother has been here. He\xe2\x80\x99s at school, Polly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He went for the first time yesterday, for fear he should lose any\r\nlearning. But it\xe2\x80\x99s half-holiday, Polly: if you could only stop till he\r\ncomes home\xe2\x80\x94you and Miss Nipper, leastways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jemima, mindful in\r\ngood time of the dignity of the black-eyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does he look, Jemima, bless him!\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really he don\xe2\x80\x99t look so bad as you\xe2\x80\x99d suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Jemima.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew his legs must be too short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis legs is short,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Jemima; \xe2\x80\x9cespecially behind; but they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget longer, Polly, every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a slow, prospective kind of consolation; but the cheerfulness\r\nand good nature with which it was administered, gave it a value it did\r\nnot intrinsically possess. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, Polly asked, in a\r\nmore sprightly manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s Father, Jemima dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for by that patriarchal appellation,\r\nMr Toodle was generally known in the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jemima. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity! Father took his dinner with\r\nhim this morning, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming home till night. But he\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ntalking of you, Polly, and telling the children about you; and is the\r\npeaceablest, patientest, best-temperedest soul in the world, as he\r\nalways was and will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Jemima,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the simple Polly; delighted by the speech, and\r\ndisappointed by the absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you needn\xe2\x80\x99t thank me, Polly,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister, giving her a\r\nsounding kiss upon the cheek, and then dancing little Paul cheerfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say the same of you sometimes, and think it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the double disappointment, it was impossible to regard in\r\nthe light of a failure a visit which was greeted with such a reception;\r\nso the sisters talked hopefully about family matters, and about Biler,\r\nand about all his brothers and sisters: while the black-eyed, having\r\nperformed several journeys to Banbury Cross and back, took sharp note\r\nof the furniture, the Dutch clock, the cupboard, the castle on the\r\nmantel-piece with red and green windows in it, susceptible of\r\nillumination by a candle-end within; and the pair of small black velvet\r\nkittens, each with a lady\xe2\x80\x99s reticule in its mouth; regarded by the\r\nStaggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardeners as prodigies of imitative art. The conversation soon\r\nbecoming general lest the black-eyed should go off at score and turn\r\nsarcastic, that young lady related to Jemima a summary of everything\r\nshe knew concerning Mr Dombey, his prospects, family, pursuits, and\r\ncharacter. Also an exact inventory of her personal wardrobe, and some\r\naccount of her principal relations and friends. Having relieved her\r\nmind of these disclosures, she partook of shrimps and porter, and\r\nevinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship.\r\n\r\nLittle Florence herself was not behind-hand in improving the occasion;\r\nfor, being conducted forth by the young Toodles to inspect some\r\ntoad-stools and other curiosities of the Gardens, she entered with\r\nthem, heart and soul, on the formation of a temporary breakwater across\r\na small green pool that had collected in a corner. She was still busily\r\nengaged in that labour, when sought and found by Susan; who, such was\r\nher sense of duty, even under the humanizing influence of shrimps,\r\ndelivered a moral address to her (punctuated with thumps) on her\r\ndegenerate nature, while washing her face and hands; and predicted that\r\nshe would bring the grey hairs of her family in general, with sorrow to\r\nthe grave. After some delay, occasioned by a pretty long confidential\r\ninterview above stairs on pecuniary subjects, between Polly and Jemima,\r\nan interchange of babies was again effected\xe2\x80\x94for Polly had all this time\r\nretained her own child, and Jemima little Paul\xe2\x80\x94and the visitors took\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nBut first the young Toodles, victims of a pious fraud, were deluded\r\ninto repairing in a body to a chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop in the neighbourhood, for\r\nthe ostensible purpose of spending a penny; and when the coast was\r\nquite clear, Polly fled: Jemima calling after her that if they could\r\nonly go round towards the City Road on their way back, they would be\r\nsure to meet little Biler coming from school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that we might make time to go a little round in that\r\ndirection, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Polly, when they halted to take breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Mrs Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting on towards our dinner time you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\nBut lunch had rendered her companion more than indifferent to this\r\ngrave consideration, so she allowed no weight to it, and they resolved\r\nto go \xe2\x80\x9ca little round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, it happened that poor Biler\xe2\x80\x99s life had been, since yesterday\r\nmorning, rendered weary by the costume of the Charitable Grinders. The\r\nyouth of the streets could not endure it. No young vagabond could be\r\nbrought to bear its contemplation for a moment, without throwing\r\nhimself upon the unoffending wearer, and doing him a mischief. His\r\nsocial existence had been more like that of an early Christian, than an\r\ninnocent child of the nineteenth century. He had been stoned in the\r\nstreets. He had been overthrown into gutters; bespattered with mud;\r\nviolently flattened against posts. Entire strangers to his person had\r\nlifted his yellow cap off his head, and cast it to the winds. His legs\r\nhad not only undergone verbal criticisms and revilings, but had been\r\nhandled and pinched. That very morning, he had received a perfectly\r\nunsolicited black eye on his way to the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 establishment, and\r\nhad been punished for it by the master: a superannuated old Grinder of\r\nsavage disposition, who had been appointed schoolmaster because he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fit for anything, and for whose cruel\r\ncane all chubby little boys had a perfect fascination.\r\n\r\nThus it fell out that Biler, on his way home, sought unfrequented\r\npaths; and slunk along by narrow passages and back streets, to avoid\r\nhis tormentors. Being compelled to emerge into the main road, his ill\r\nfortune brought him at last where a small party of boys, headed by a\r\nferocious young butcher, were lying in wait for any means of\r\npleasurable excitement that might happen. These, finding a Charitable\r\nGrinder in the midst of them\xe2\x80\x94unaccountably delivered over, as it were,\r\ninto their hands\xe2\x80\x94set up a general yell and rushed upon him.\r\n\r\nBut it so fell out likewise, that, at the same time, Polly, looking\r\nhopelessly along the road before her, after a good hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk, had\r\nsaid it was no use going any further, when suddenly she saw this sight.\r\nShe no sooner saw it than, uttering a hasty exclamation, and giving\r\nMaster Dombey to the black-eyed, she started to the rescue of her\r\nunhappy little son.\r\n\r\nSurprises, like misfortunes, rarely come alone. The astonished Susan\r\nNipper and her two young charges were rescued by the bystanders from\r\nunder the very wheels of a passing carriage before they knew what had\r\nhappened; and at that moment (it was market day) a thundering alarm of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad Bull!\xe2\x80\x9d was raised.\r\n\r\nWith a wild confusion before her, of people running up and down, and\r\nshouting, and wheels running over them, and boys fighting, and mad\r\nbulls coming up, and the nurse in the midst of all these dangers being\r\ntorn to pieces, Florence screamed and ran. She ran till she was\r\nexhausted, urging Susan to do the same; and then, stopping and wringing\r\nher hands as she remembered they had left the other nurse behind,\r\nfound, with a sensation of terror not to be described, that she was\r\nquite alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan! Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, clapping her hands in the very ecstasy\r\nof her alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, where are they? where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d said an old woman, coming hobbling across as fast as\r\nshe could from the opposite side of the way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you run away from\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I did. I\r\nthought they were with me. Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman took her by the wrist, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a very ugly old woman, with red rims round her eyes, and a\r\nmouth that mumbled and chattered of itself when she was not speaking.\r\nShe was miserably dressed, and carried some skins over her arm. She\r\nseemed to have followed Florence some little way at all events, for she\r\nhad lost her breath; and this made her uglier still, as she stood\r\ntrying to regain it: working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into\r\nall sorts of contortions.\r\n\r\nFlorence was afraid of her, and looked, hesitating, up the street, of\r\nwhich she had almost reached the bottom. It was a solitary place\xe2\x80\x94more a\r\nback road than a street\xe2\x80\x94and there was no one in it but her-self and the\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, still holding her\r\ntight. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Mrs Brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they near here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, beginning to be led away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan ain\xe2\x80\x99t far off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown; \xe2\x80\x9cand the others are close\r\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anybody hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\nThe child shed tears of delight on hearing this, and accompanied the\r\nold woman willingly; though she could not help glancing at her face as\r\nthey went along\xe2\x80\x94particularly at that industrious mouth\xe2\x80\x94and wondering\r\nwhether Bad Mrs Brown, if there were such a person, was at all like\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far, but had gone by some very uncomfortable places,\r\nsuch as brick-fields and tile-yards, when the old woman turned down a\r\ndirty lane, where the mud lay in deep black ruts in the middle of the\r\nroad. She stopped before a shabby little house, as closely shut up as a\r\nhouse that was full of cracks and crevices could be. Opening the door\r\nwith a key she took out of her bonnet, she pushed the child before her\r\ninto a back room, where there was a great heap of rags of different\r\ncolours lying on the floor; a heap of bones, and a heap of sifted dust\r\nor cinders; but there was no furniture at all, and the walls and\r\nceiling were quite black.\r\n\r\nThe child became so terrified the she was stricken speechless, and\r\nlooked as though about to swoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t be a young mule,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown, reviving her with a\r\nshake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a going to hurt you. Sit upon the rags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence obeyed her, holding out her folded hands, in mute\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a going to keep you, even, above an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye understand what I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child answered with great difficulty, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown, taking her own seat on the bones, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nvex me. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you. But if you do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkill you. I could have you killed at any time\xe2\x80\x94even if you was in your\r\nown bed at home. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s know who you are, and what you are, and all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman\xe2\x80\x99s threats and promises; the dread of giving her offence;\r\nand the habit, unusual to a child, but almost natural to Florence now,\r\nof being quiet, and repressing what she felt, and feared, and hoped;\r\nenabled her to do this bidding, and to tell her little history, or what\r\nshe knew of it. Mrs Brown listened attentively, until she had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo your name\xe2\x80\x99s Dombey, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want that pretty frock, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\r\nlittle bonnet, and a petticoat or two, and anything else you can spare.\r\nCome! Take \xe2\x80\x99em off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence obeyed, as fast as her trembling hands would allow; keeping,\r\nall the while, a frightened eye on Mrs Brown. When she had divested\r\nherself of all the articles of apparel mentioned by that lady, Mrs B.\r\nexamined them at leisure, and seemed tolerably well satisfied with\r\ntheir quality and value.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, running her eyes over the child\xe2\x80\x99s slight figure, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see anything else\xe2\x80\x94except the shoes. I must have the shoes, Miss\r\nDombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor little Florence took them off with equal alacrity, only too glad\r\nto have any more means of conciliation about her. The old woman then\r\nproduced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags,\r\nwhich she turned up for that purpose; together with a girl\xe2\x80\x99s cloak,\r\nquite worn out and very old; and the crushed remains of a bonnet that\r\nhad probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill. In this dainty\r\nraiment, she instructed Florence to dress herself; and as such\r\npreparation seemed a prelude to her release, the child complied with\r\nincreased readiness, if possible.\r\n\r\nIn hurriedly putting on the bonnet, if that may be called a bonnet\r\nwhich was more like a pad to carry loads on, she caught it in her hair\r\nwhich grew luxuriantly, and could not immediately disentangle it. Good\r\nMrs Brown whipped out a large pair of scissors, and fell into an\r\nunaccountable state of excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was contented?\r\nYou little fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d panted Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Brown. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you expect I can help it?\r\nWhy, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, ruffling her curls with a furious\r\npleasure, \xe2\x80\x9canybody but me would have had \xe2\x80\x99em off, first of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence was so relieved to find that it was only her hair and not her\r\nhead which Mrs Brown coveted, that she offered no resistance or\r\nentreaty, and merely raised her mild eyes towards the face of that good\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t once had a gal of my own\xe2\x80\x94beyond seas now\xe2\x80\x94that was proud of\r\nher hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have had every lock of it. She\xe2\x80\x99s far\r\naway, she\xe2\x80\x99s far away! Oho! Oho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Brown\xe2\x80\x99s was not a melodious cry, but, accompanied with a wild\r\ntossing up of her lean arms, it was full of passionate grief, and\r\nthrilled to the heart of Florence, whom it frightened more than ever.\r\nIt had its part, perhaps, in saving her curls; for Mrs Brown, after\r\nhovering about her with the scissors for some moments, like a new kind\r\nof butterfly, bade her hide them under the bonnet and let no trace of\r\nthem escape to tempt her. Having accomplished this victory over\r\nherself, Mrs Brown resumed her seat on the bones, and smoked a very\r\nshort black pipe, mowing and mumbling all the time, as if she were\r\neating the stem.\r\n\r\nWhen the pipe was smoked out, she gave the child a rabbit-skin to\r\ncarry, that she might appear the more like her ordinary companion, and\r\ntold her that she was now going to lead her to a public street whence\r\nshe could inquire her way to her friends. But she cautioned her, with\r\nthreats of summary and deadly vengeance in case of disobedience, not to\r\ntalk to strangers, nor to repair to her own home (which may have been\r\ntoo near for Mrs Brown\xe2\x80\x99s convenience), but to her father\xe2\x80\x99s office in\r\nthe City; also to wait at the street corner where she would be left,\r\nuntil the clock struck three. These directions Mrs Brown enforced with\r\nassurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment\r\ncognizant of all she did; and these directions Florence promised\r\nfaithfully and earnestly to observe.\r\n\r\nAt length, Mrs Brown, issuing forth, conducted her changed and ragged\r\nlittle friend through a labyrinth of narrow streets and lanes and\r\nalleys, which emerged, after a long time, upon a stable yard, with a\r\ngateway at the end, whence the roar of a great thoroughfare made itself\r\naudible. Pointing out this gateway, and informing Florence that when\r\nthe clocks struck three she was to go to the left, Mrs Brown, after\r\nmaking a parting grasp at her hair which seemed involuntary and quite\r\nbeyond her own control, told her she knew what to do, and bade her go\r\nand do it: remembering that she was watched.\r\n\r\nWith a lighter heart, but still sore afraid, Florence felt herself\r\nreleased, and tripped off to the corner. When she reached it, she\r\nlooked back and saw the head of Good Mrs Brown peeping out of the low\r\nwooden passage, where she had issued her parting injunctions; likewise\r\nthe fist of Good Mrs Brown shaking towards her. But though she often\r\nlooked back afterwards\xe2\x80\x94every minute, at least, in her nervous\r\nrecollection of the old woman\xe2\x80\x94she could not see her again.\r\n\r\nFlorence remained there, looking at the bustle in the street, and more\r\nand more bewildered by it; and in the meanwhile the clocks appeared to\r\nhave made up their minds never to strike three any more. At last the\r\nsteeples rang out three o\xe2\x80\x99clock; there was one close by, so she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be mistaken; and\xe2\x80\x94after often looking over her shoulder, and\r\noften going a little way, and as often coming back again, lest the\r\nall-powerful spies of Mrs Brown should take offence\xe2\x80\x94she hurried off, as\r\nfast as she could in her slipshod shoes, holding the rabbit-skin tight\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\nAll she knew of her father\xe2\x80\x99s offices was that they belonged to Dombey\r\nand Son, and that that was a great power belonging to the City. So she\r\ncould only ask the way to Dombey and Son\xe2\x80\x99s in the City; and as she\r\ngenerally made inquiry of children\xe2\x80\x94being afraid to ask grown people\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ngot very little satisfaction indeed. But by dint of asking her way to\r\nthe City after a while, and dropping the rest of her inquiry for the\r\npresent, she really did advance, by slow degrees, towards the heart of\r\nthat great region which is governed by the terrible Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\nTired of walking, repulsed and pushed about, stunned by the noise and\r\nconfusion, anxious for her brother and the nurses, terrified by what\r\nshe had undergone, and the prospect of encountering her angry father in\r\nsuch an altered state; perplexed and frightened alike by what had\r\npassed, and what was passing, and what was yet before her; Florence\r\nwent upon her weary way with tearful eyes, and once or twice could not\r\nhelp stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly. But few\r\npeople noticed her at those times, in the garb she wore: or if they\r\ndid, believed that she was tutored to excite compassion, and passed on.\r\nFlorence, too, called to her aid all the firmness and self-reliance of\r\na character that her sad experience had prematurely formed and tried:\r\nand keeping the end she had in view steadily before her, steadily\r\npursued it.\r\n\r\nIt was full two hours later in the afternoon than when she had started\r\non this strange adventure, when, escaping from the clash and clangour\r\nof a narrow street full of carts and waggons, she peeped into a kind of\r\nwharf or landing-place upon the river-side, where there were a great\r\nmany packages, casks, and boxes, strewn about; a large pair of wooden\r\nscales; and a little wooden house on wheels, outside of which, looking\r\nat the neighbouring masts and boats, a stout man stood whistling, with\r\nhis pen behind his ear, and his hands in his pockets, as if his day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork were nearly done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then!\xe2\x80\x9d said this man, happening to turn round. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nanything for you, little girl. Be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, is this the City?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the trembling daughter of the\r\nDombeys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! It\xe2\x80\x99s the City. You know that well enough, I daresay. Be off! We\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d was the timid answer. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept to\r\nknow the way to Dombey and Son\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man who had been strolling carelessly towards her, seemed surprised\r\nby this reply, and looking attentively in her face, rejoined:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what can you want with Dombey and Son\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo know the way there, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man looked at her yet more curiously, and rubbed the back of his\r\nhead so hard in his wonderment that he knocked his own hat off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to another man\xe2\x80\x94a labourer\xe2\x80\x94as he picked it up and put\r\nit on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that young spark of Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s who\xe2\x80\x99s been watching the shipment\r\nof them goods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust gone, by tt\xe2\x80\x99other gate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him back a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe ran up an archway, bawling as he went, and very soon returned with\r\na blithe-looking boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s jockey, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the first man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House, Mr Clark,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ye here, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Clark.\r\n\r\nObedient to the indication of Mr Clark\xe2\x80\x99s hand, the boy approached\r\ntowards Florence, wondering, as well he might, what he had to do with\r\nher. But she, who had heard what passed, and who, besides the relief of\r\nso suddenly considering herself safe at her journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, felt\r\nreassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner,\r\nran eagerly up to him, leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the\r\nground and caught his hand in both of hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lost, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was lost this morning, a long way from here\xe2\x80\x94and I have had my\r\nclothes taken away, since\xe2\x80\x94and I am not dressed in my own now\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\nname is Florence Dombey, my little brother\xe2\x80\x99s only sister\xe2\x80\x94and, oh dear,\r\ndear, take care of me, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Florence, giving full\r\nvent to the childish feelings she had so long suppressed, and bursting\r\ninto tears. At the same time her miserable bonnet falling off, her hair\r\ncame tumbling down about her face: moving to speechless admiration and\r\ncommiseration, young Walter, nephew of Solomon Gills, Ships\xe2\x80\x99\r\nInstrument-maker in general.\r\n\r\nMr Clark stood rapt in amazement: observing under his breath, I never\r\nsaw such a start on this wharf before. Walter picked up the shoe, and\r\nput it on the little foot as the Prince in the story might have fitted\r\nCinderella\xe2\x80\x99s slipper on. He hung the rabbit-skin over his left arm;\r\ngave the right to Florence; and felt, not to say like Richard\r\nWhittington\xe2\x80\x94that is a tame comparison\xe2\x80\x94but like Saint George of England,\r\nwith the dragon lying dead before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, in a transport of enthusiasm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wonderful thing for me that I am here! You are as safe now as\r\nif you were guarded by a whole boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew of picked men from a\r\nman-of-war. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only crying for joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrying for joy!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m the cause of it! Come along,\r\nMiss Dombey. There\xe2\x80\x99s the other shoe off now! Take mine, Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, checking him in the act of impetuously\r\npulling off his own. \xe2\x80\x9cThese do better. These do very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, glancing at her foot, \xe2\x80\x9cmine are a mile\r\ntoo large. What am I thinking about! You never could walk in mine! Come\r\nalong, Miss Dombey. Let me see the villain who will dare molest you\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Walter, looking immensely fierce, led off Florence, looking very\r\nhappy; and they went arm-in-arm along the streets, perfectly\r\nindifferent to any astonishment that their appearance might or did\r\nexcite by the way.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark and foggy, and beginning to rain too; but they\r\ncared nothing for this: being both wholly absorbed in the late\r\nadventures of Florence, which she related with the innocent good faith\r\nand confidence of her years, while Walter listened as if, far from the\r\nmud and grease of Thames Street, they were rambling alone among the\r\nbroad leaves and tall trees of some desert island in the tropics\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\nvery likely fancied, for the time, they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we far to go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence at last, lilting up her eyes to her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! By-the-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, stopping, \xe2\x80\x9clet me see; where are we? Oh!\r\nI know. But the offices are shut up now, Miss Dombey. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody\r\nthere. Mr Dombey has gone home long ago. I suppose we must go home too?\r\nor, stay. Suppose I take you to my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, where I live\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s very near\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94and go to your house in a coach to tell them you are safe, and\r\nbring you back some clothes. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that be best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they stood deliberating in the street, a man passed them, who\r\nglanced quickly at Walter as he went by, as if he recognised him; but\r\nseeming to correct that first impression, he passed on without\r\nstopping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cCarker in our House. Not\r\nCarker our Manager, Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x94the other Carker; the Junior\xe2\x80\x94Halloa! Mr\r\nCarker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Walter Gay?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, stopping and returning. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, with such a strange companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he stood near a lamp, listening with surprise to Walter\xe2\x80\x99s hurried\r\nexplanation, he presented a remarkable contrast to the two youthful\r\nfigures arm-in-arm before him. He was not old, but his hair was white;\r\nhis body was bent, or bowed as if by the weight of some great trouble:\r\nand there were deep lines in his worn and melancholy face. The fire of\r\nhis eyes, the expression of his features, the very voice in which he\r\nspoke, were all subdued and quenched, as if the spirit within him lay\r\nin ashes. He was respectably, though very plainly dressed, in black;\r\nbut his clothes, moulded to the general character of his figure, seemed\r\nto shrink and abase themselves upon him, and to join in the sorrowful\r\nsolicitation which the whole man from head to foot expressed, to be\r\nleft unnoticed, and alone in his humility.\r\n\r\nAnd yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with\r\nthe other embers of his soul, for he watched the boy\xe2\x80\x99s earnest\r\ncountenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy, though with an\r\ninexplicable show of trouble and compassion, which escaped into his\r\nlooks, however hard he strove to hold it prisoner. When Walter, in\r\nconclusion, put to him the question he had put to Florence, he still\r\nstood glancing at him with the same expression, as if he had read some\r\nfate upon his face, mournfully at variance with its present brightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you advise, Mr Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always give\r\nme good advice, you know, when you do speak to me. That\xe2\x80\x99s not often,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your own idea is the best,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered: looking from Florence\r\nto Walter, and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, brightening with a generous thought, \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for you. Go you to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s, and be the messenger of\r\ngood news. It may do you some good, Sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain at home. You shall\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Why not, Mr Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\nHe merely shook him by the hand in answer; he seemed in a manner\r\nashamed and afraid even to do that; and bidding him good-night, and\r\nadvising him to make haste, turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, looking after him as they turned away\r\nalso, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s as quick as we can. Did you ever hear Mr\r\nDombey speak of Mr Carker the Junior, Miss Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child, mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t often hear Papa speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! true! more shame for him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Walter. After a minute\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\nduring which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little\r\nface moving on at his side, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe strangest man, Mr Carker the\r\nJunior is, Miss Florence, that ever you heard of. If you could\r\nunderstand what an extraordinary interest he takes in me, and yet how\r\nhe shuns me and avoids me; and what a low place he holds in our office,\r\nand how he is never advanced, and never complains, though year after\r\nyear he sees young men passed over his head, and though his brother\r\n(younger than he is), is our head Manager, you would be as much puzzled\r\nabout him as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Florence could hardly be expected to understand much about it,\r\nWalter bestirred himself with his accustomed boyish animation and\r\nrestlessness to change the subject; and one of the unfortunate shoes\r\ncoming off again opportunely, proposed to carry Florence to his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin his arms. Florence, though very tired, laughingly declined the\r\nproposal, lest he should let her fall; and as they were already near\r\nthe wooden Midshipman, and as Walter went on to cite various\r\nprecedents, from shipwrecks and other moving accidents, where younger\r\nboys than he had triumphantly rescued and carried off older girls than\r\nFlorence, they were still in full conversation about it when they\r\narrived at the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloa, Uncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, bursting into the shop, and speaking\r\nincoherently and out of breath, from that time forth, for the rest of\r\nthe evening. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful adventure! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nlost in the streets, and robbed of her clothes by an old witch of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94found by me\xe2\x80\x94brought home to our parlour to rest\xe2\x80\x94look here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Sol, starting back against his favourite\r\ncompass-case. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be! Well, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor anybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, anticipating the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\r\nwould, nobody could, you know. Here! just help me lift the little sofa\r\nnear the fire, will you, Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x94take care of the plates\xe2\x80\x94cut some\r\ndinner for her, will you, Uncle\xe2\x80\x94throw those shoes under the grate. Miss\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x94put your feet on the fender to dry\xe2\x80\x94how damp they are\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nadventure, Uncle, eh?\xe2\x80\x94God bless my soul, how hot I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon Gills was quite as hot, by sympathy, and in excessive\r\nbewilderment. He patted Florence\xe2\x80\x99s head, pressed her to eat, pressed\r\nher to drink, rubbed the soles of her feet with his pocket-handkerchief\r\nheated at the fire, followed his locomotive nephew with his eyes, and\r\nears, and had no clear perception of anything except that he was being\r\nconstantly knocked against and tumbled over by that excited young\r\ngentleman, as he darted about the room attempting to accomplish twenty\r\nthings at once, and doing nothing at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, wait a minute, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, catching up a candle, \xe2\x80\x9ctill\r\nI run upstairs, and get another jacket on, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be off. I say,\r\nUncle, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this an adventure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, who, with his spectacles on his forehead\r\nand the great chronometer in his pocket, was incessantly oscillating\r\nbetween Florence on the sofa, and his nephew in all parts of the\r\nparlour, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but do, Uncle, please\xe2\x80\x94do, Miss Florence\xe2\x80\x94dinner, you know, Uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Solomon, cutting instantly into a leg of mutton,\r\nas if he were catering for a giant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of her, Wally! I\r\nunderstand. Pretty dear! Famished, of course. You go and get ready.\r\nLord bless me! Sir Richard Whittington thrice Lord Mayor of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter was not very long in mounting to his lofty garret and descending\r\nfrom it, but in the meantime Florence, overcome by fatigue, had sunk\r\ninto a doze before the fire. The short interval of quiet, though only a\r\nfew minutes in duration, enabled Solomon Gills so far to collect his\r\nwits as to make some little arrangements for her comfort, and to darken\r\nthe room, and to screen her from the blaze. Thus, when the boy\r\nreturned, she was sleeping peacefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s capital!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, giving Solomon such a hug that it\r\nsqueezed a new expression into his face. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m off. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a\r\ncrust of bread with me, for I\xe2\x80\x99m very hungry\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t wake her, Uncle\r\nSol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such a face, Uncle Sol.\r\nNow I\xe2\x80\x99m off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Uncle Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, putting his face in at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does she look now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s famous! now I\xe2\x80\x99m off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Uncle Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, reappearing at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met Mr Carker the Junior in the street, queerer than ever. He bade\r\nme good-bye, but came behind us here\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s an odd thing!\xe2\x80\x94for when we\r\nreached the shop door, I looked round, and saw him going quietly away,\r\nlike a servant who had seen me home, or a faithful dog. How does she\r\nlook now, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty much the same as before, Wally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Uncle Sol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Now I am off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this time he really was: and Solomon Gills, with no appetite for\r\ndinner, sat on the opposite side of the fire, watching Florence in her\r\nslumber, building a great many airy castles of the most fantastic\r\narchitecture; and looking, in the dim shade, and in the close vicinity\r\nof all the instruments, like a magician disguised in a Welsh wig and a\r\nsuit of coffee colour, who held the child in an enchanted sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Walter proceeded towards Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house at a pace\r\nseldom achieved by a hack horse from the stand; and yet with his head\r\nout of window every two or three minutes, in impatient remonstrance\r\nwith the driver. Arriving at his journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, he leaped out, and\r\nbreathlessly announcing his errand to the servant, followed him\r\nstraight into the library, we there was a great confusion of tongues,\r\nand where Mr Dombey, his sister, and Miss Tox, Richards, and Nipper,\r\nwere all congregated together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, rushing up to him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhappy to say it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Sir. Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s found!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy with his open face, and flowing hair, and sparkling eyes,\r\npanting with pleasure and excitement, was wonderfully opposed to Mr\r\nDombey, as he sat confronting him in his library chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, Louisa, that she would certainly be found,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey, looking slightly over his shoulder at that lady, who wept in\r\ncompany with Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the servants know that no further steps are\r\nnecessary. This boy who brings the information, is young Gay, from the\r\noffice. How was my daughter found, Sir? I know how she was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nhe looked majestically at Richards. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how was she found? Who found\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I believe I found Miss Dombey, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter modestly, \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\nleast I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can claim the merit of having exactly found\r\nher, Sir, but I was the fortunate instrument of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr Dombey, regarding the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevident pride and pleasure in his share of the transaction with an\r\ninstinctive dislike, \xe2\x80\x9cby not having exactly found my daughter, and by\r\nbeing a fortunate instrument? Be plain and coherent, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite out of Walter\xe2\x80\x99s power to be coherent; but he rendered\r\nhimself as explanatory as he could, in his breathless state, and stated\r\nwhy he had come alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear this, girl?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nwhat is necessary, and return immediately with this young man to fetch\r\nMiss Florence home. Gay, you will be rewarded to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I was\r\nnot thinking of any reward, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, suddenly and almost fiercely; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhat you think of, or affect to think of, is of little consequence. You\r\nhave done well, Sir. Don\xe2\x80\x99t undo it. Louisa, please to give the lad some\r\nwine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s glance followed Walter Gay with sharp disfavour, as he left\r\nthe room under the pilotage of Mrs Chick; and it may be that his mind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye followed him with no greater relish, as he rode back to his Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwith Miss Susan Nipper.\r\n\r\nThere they found that Florence, much refreshed by sleep, had dined, and\r\ngreatly improved the acquaintance of Solomon Gills, with whom she was\r\non terms of perfect confidence and ease. The black-eyed (who had cried\r\nso much that she might now be called the red-eyed, and who was very\r\nsilent and depressed) caught her in her arms without a word of\r\ncontradiction or reproach, and made a very hysterical meeting of it.\r\nThen converting the parlour, for the nonce, into a private tiring room,\r\nshe dressed her, with great care, in proper clothes; and presently led\r\nher forth, as like a Dombey as her natural disqualifications admitted\r\nof her being made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, running up to Solomon. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been very\r\ngood to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol was quite delighted, and kissed her like her grand-father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Walter! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, giving both his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! indeed I never will.\r\nGood-bye, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the innocence of her grateful heart, the child lifted up her face to\r\nhis. Walter, bending down his own, raised it again, all red and\r\nburning; and looked at Uncle Sol, quite sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShake\r\nhands once more, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d This was still Florence\xe2\x80\x99s cry, after she was\r\nshut up with her little maid, in the coach. And when the coach at\r\nlength moved off, Walter on the door-step gaily returned the waving of\r\nher handkerchief, while the wooden Midshipman behind him seemed, like\r\nhimself, intent upon that coach alone, excluding all the other passing\r\ncoaches from his observation.\r\n\r\nIn good time Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s mansion was gained again, and again there was\r\na noise of tongues in the library. Again, too, the coach was ordered to\r\nwait\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d one of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-servants ominously\r\nwhispered, as she passed with Florence.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the lost child made a slight sensation, but not much.\r\nMr Dombey, who had never found her, kissed her once upon the forehead,\r\nand cautioned her not to run away again, or wander anywhere with\r\ntreacherous attendants. Mrs Chick stopped in her lamentations on the\r\ncorruption of human nature, even when beckoned to the paths of virtue\r\nby a Charitable Grinder; and received her with a welcome something\r\nshort of the reception due to none but perfect Dombeys. Miss Tox\r\nregulated her feelings by the models before her. Richards, the culprit\r\nRichards, alone poured out her heart in broken words of welcome, and\r\nbowed herself over the little wandering head as if she really loved it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Richards!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been much\r\nmore satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow\r\ncreatures, and much more becoming in you, if you had shown some proper\r\nfeeling, in time, for the little child that is now going to be\r\nprematurely deprived of its natural nourishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, in a plaintive whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom one common\r\nfountain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was my ungrateful case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I had\r\nyour reflections, Richards, I should feel as if the Charitable\r\nGrinders\xe2\x80\x99 dress would blight my child, and the education choke him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the matter of that\xe2\x80\x94but Mrs Chick didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x94he had been pretty\r\nwell blighted by the dress already; and as to the education, even its\r\nretributive effect might be produced in time, for it was a storm of\r\nsobs and blows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary to prolong these\r\nobservations. The woman is discharged and paid. You leave this house,\r\nRichards, for taking my son\xe2\x80\x94my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, emphatically\r\nrepeating these two words, \xe2\x80\x9cinto haunts and into society which are not\r\nto be thought of without a shudder. As to the accident which befel Miss\r\nFlorence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy\r\nand fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I\r\nnever could have known\xe2\x80\x94and from your own lips too\xe2\x80\x94of what you had been\r\nguilty. I think, Louisa, the other nurse, the young person,\xe2\x80\x9d here Miss\r\nNipper sobbed aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing so much younger, and necessarily influenced\r\nby Paul\xe2\x80\x99s nurse, may remain. Have the goodness to direct that this\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s coach is paid to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dombey stopped and winced\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly moved towards the door, with Florence holding to her dress, and\r\ncrying to her in the most pathetic manner not to go away. It was a\r\ndagger in the haughty father\xe2\x80\x99s heart, an arrow in his brain, to see how\r\nthe flesh and blood he could not disown clung to this obscure stranger,\r\nand he sitting by. Not that he cared to whom his daughter turned, or\r\nfrom whom turned away. The swift sharp agony struck through him, as he\r\nthought of what his son might do.\r\n\r\nHis son cried lustily that night, at all events. Sooth to say, poor\r\nPaul had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have,\r\nfor he had lost his second mother\xe2\x80\x94his first, so far as he knew\xe2\x80\x94by a\r\nstroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the\r\nbeginning of his life. At the same blow, his sister too, who cried\r\nherself to sleep so mournfully, had lost as good and true a friend. But\r\nthat is quite beside the question. Let us waste no words about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA Bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye Glimpse of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s Dwelling-place: also of the State of\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s Affections\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Tox inhabited a dark little house that had been squeezed, at some\r\nremote period of English History, into a fashionable neighbourhood at\r\nthe west end of the town, where it stood in the shade like a poor\r\nrelation of the great street round the corner, coldly looked down upon\r\nby mighty mansions. It was not exactly in a court, and it was not\r\nexactly in a yard; but it was in the dullest of No-Thoroughfares,\r\nrendered anxious and haggard by distant double knocks. The name of this\r\nretirement, where grass grew between the chinks in the stone pavement,\r\nwas Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place; and in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place was Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel,\r\nwith a tinkling bell, where sometimes as many as five-and-twenty people\r\nattended service on a Sunday. The Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Arms was also there, and\r\nmuch resorted to by splendid footmen. A sedan chair was kept inside the\r\nrailing before the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, but it had never come out within\r\nthe memory of man; and on fine mornings, the top of every rail (there\r\nwere eight-and-forty, as Miss Tox had often counted) was decorated with\r\na pewter-pot.\r\n\r\nThere was another private house besides Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place:\r\nnot to mention an immense Pair of gates, with an immense pair of\r\nlion-headed knockers on them, which were never opened by any chance,\r\nand were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstables. Indeed, there was a smack of stabling in the air of Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace; and Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom (which was at the back) commanded a vista\r\nof Mews, where hostlers, at whatever sort of work engaged, were\r\ncontinually accompanying themselves with effervescent noises; and where\r\nthe most domestic and confidential garments of coachmen and their wives\r\nand families, usually hung, like Macbeth\xe2\x80\x99s banners, on the outward\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nAt this other private house in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, tenanted by a retired\r\nbutler who had married a housekeeper, apartments were let Furnished, to\r\na single gentleman: to wit, a wooden-featured, blue-faced Major, with\r\nhis eyes starting out of his head, in whom Miss Tox recognised, as she\r\nherself expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9csomething so truly military;\xe2\x80\x9d and between whom\r\nand herself, an occasional interchange of newspapers and pamphlets, and\r\nsuch Platonic dalliance, was effected through the medium of a dark\r\nservant of the Major\xe2\x80\x99s who Miss Tox was quite content to classify as a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnative,\xe2\x80\x9d without connecting him with any geographical idea whatever.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there never was a smaller entry and staircase, than the entry\r\nand staircase of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s house. Perhaps, taken altogether, from top\r\nto bottom, it was the most inconvenient little house in England, and\r\nthe crookedest; but then, Miss Tox said, what a situation! There was\r\nvery little daylight to be got there in the winter: no sun at the best\r\nof times: air was out of the question, and traffic was walled out.\r\nStill Miss Tox said, think of the situation! So said the blue-faced\r\nMajor, whose eyes were starting out of his head: who gloried in\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s Place: and who delighted to turn the conversation at his\r\nclub, whenever he could, to something connected with some of the great\r\npeople in the great street round the corner, that he might have the\r\nsatisfaction of saying they were his neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn short, with Miss Tox and the blue-faced Major, it was enough for\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s Place\xe2\x80\x94as with a very small fragment of society, it is enough\r\nfor many a little hanger-on of another sort\xe2\x80\x94to be well connected, and\r\nto have genteel blood in its veins. It might be poor, mean, shabby,\r\nstupid, dull. No matter. The great street round the corner trailed off\r\ninto Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place; and that which of High Holborn would have become\r\na choleric word, spoken of Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place became flat blasphemy.\r\n\r\nThe dingy tenement inhabited by Miss Tox was her own; having been\r\ndevised and bequeathed to her by the deceased owner of the fishy eye in\r\nthe locket, of whom a miniature portrait, with a powdered head and a\r\npigtail, balanced the kettle-holder on opposite sides of the parlour\r\nfireplace. The greater part of the furniture was of the powdered-head\r\nand pig-tail period: comprising a plate-warmer, always languishing and\r\nsprawling its four attenuated bow legs in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s way; and an\r\nobsolete harpsichord, illuminated round the maker\xe2\x80\x99s name with a painted\r\ngarland of sweet peas. In any part of the house, visitors were usually\r\ncognizant of a prevailing mustiness; and in warm weather Miss Tox had\r\nbeen seen apparently writing in sundry chinks and crevices of the\r\nwainscoat with the wrong end of a pen dipped in spirits of\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\nAlthough Major Bagstock had arrived at what is called in polite\r\nliterature, the grand meridian of life, and was proceeding on his\r\njourney downhill with hardly any throat, and a very rigid pair of\r\njaw-bones, and long-flapped elephantine ears, and his eyes and\r\ncomplexion in the state of artificial excitement already mentioned, he\r\nwas mightily proud of awakening an interest in Miss Tox, and tickled\r\nhis vanity with the fiction that she was a splendid woman who had her\r\neye on him. This he had several times hinted at the club: in connexion\r\nwith little jocularities, of which old Joe Bagstock, old Joey Bagstock,\r\nold J. Bagstock, old Josh Bagstock, or so forth, was the perpetual\r\ntheme: it being, as it were, the Major\xe2\x80\x99s stronghold and donjon-keep of\r\nlight humour, to be on the most familiar terms with his own name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoey B., Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the Major would say, with a flourish of his\r\nwalking-stick, \xe2\x80\x9cis worth a dozen of you. If you had a few more of the\r\nBagstock breed among you, Sir, you\xe2\x80\x99d be none the worse for it. Old Joe,\r\nSir, needn\xe2\x80\x99t look far for a wife even now, if he was on the look-out;\r\nbut he\xe2\x80\x99s hard-hearted, Sir, is Joe\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s tough, Sir, tough, and\r\nde-vilish sly!\xe2\x80\x9d After such a declaration, wheezing sounds would be\r\nheard; and the Major\xe2\x80\x99s blue would deepen into purple, while his eyes\r\nstrained and started convulsively.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his very liberal laudation of himself, however, the\r\nMajor was selfish. It may be doubted whether there ever was a more\r\nentirely selfish person at heart; or at stomach is perhaps a better\r\nexpression, seeing that he was more decidedly endowed with that latter\r\norgan than with the former. He had no idea of being overlooked or\r\nslighted by anybody; least of all, had he the remotest comprehension of\r\nbeing overlooked and slighted by Miss Tox.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Miss Tox, as it appeared, forgot him\xe2\x80\x94gradually forgot him. She\r\nbegan to forget him soon after her discovery of the Toodle family. She\r\ncontinued to forget him up to the time of the christening. She went on\r\nforgetting him with compound interest after that. Something or somebody\r\nhad superseded him as a source of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, meeting Miss Tox in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace, some weeks after the changes chronicled in the last chapter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox; very coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe Bagstock, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Major, with his usual gallantry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chas not had the happiness of bowing to you at your window, for a\r\nconsiderable period. Joe has been hardly used, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. His sun has been\r\nbehind a cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox inclined her head; but very coldly indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x99s luminary has been out of town, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nMajor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? out of town? oh no, I have not been out of town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been much engaged lately. My time is nearly all devoted to some\r\nvery intimate friends. I am afraid I have none to spare, even now. Good\r\nmorning, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Miss Tox, with her most fascinating step and carriage, disappeared\r\nfrom Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, the Major stood looking after her with a bluer\r\nface than ever: muttering and growling some not at all complimentary\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, damme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, rolling his lobster eyes round and\r\nround Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, and apostrophizing its fragrant air, \xe2\x80\x9csix\r\nmonths ago, the woman loved the ground Josh Bagstock walked on. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe meaning of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major decided, after some consideration, that it meant mantraps;\r\nthat it meant plotting and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t catch Joe, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\ntough, is J.B. Tough, and de-vilish sly!\xe2\x80\x9d over which reflection he\r\nchuckled for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nBut still, when that day and many other days were gone and past, it\r\nseemed that Miss Tox took no heed whatever of the Major, and thought\r\nnothing at all about him. She had been wont, once upon a time, to look\r\nout at one of her little dark windows by accident, and blushingly\r\nreturn the Major\xe2\x80\x99s greeting; but now, she never gave the Major a\r\nchance, and cared nothing at all whether he looked over the way or not.\r\nOther changes had come to pass too. The Major, standing in the shade of\r\nhis own apartment, could make out that an air of greater smartness had\r\nrecently come over Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s house; that a new cage with gilded wires\r\nhad been provided for the ancient little canary bird; that divers\r\nornaments, cut out of coloured card-boards and paper, seemed to\r\ndecorate the chimney-piece and tables; that a plant or two had suddenly\r\nsprung up in the windows; that Miss Tox occasionally practised on the\r\nharpsichord, whose garland of sweet peas was always displayed\r\nostentatiously, crowned with the Copenhagen and Bird Waltzes in a Music\r\nBook of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s own copying.\r\n\r\nOver and above all this, Miss Tox had long been dressed with uncommon\r\ncare and elegance in slight mourning. But this helped the Major out of\r\nhis difficulty; and he determined within himself that she had come into\r\na small legacy, and grown proud.\r\n\r\nIt was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at\r\nthis decision, that the Major, sitting at his breakfast, saw an\r\napparition so tremendous and wonderful in Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\ndrawing-room, that he remained for some time rooted to his chair; then,\r\nrushing into the next room, returned with a double-barrelled\r\nopera-glass, through which he surveyed it intently for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a Baby, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, shutting up the glass again, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nfifty thousand pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget it. He could do nothing but whistle, and\r\nstare to that extent, that his eyes, compared with what they now\r\nbecame, had been in former times quite cavernous and sunken. Day after\r\nday, two, three, four times a week, this Baby reappeared. The Major\r\ncontinued to stare and whistle. To all other intents and purposes he\r\nwas alone in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place. Miss Tox had ceased to mind what he did.\r\nHe might have been black as well as blue, and it would have been of no\r\nconsequence to her.\r\n\r\nThe perseverance with which she walked out of Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place to fetch\r\nthis baby and its nurse, and walked back with them, and walked home\r\nwith them again, and continually mounted guard over them; and the\r\nperseverance with which she nursed it herself, and fed it, and played\r\nwith it, and froze its young blood with airs upon the harpsichord, was\r\nextraordinary. At about this same period too, she was seized with a\r\npassion for looking at a certain bracelet; also with a passion for\r\nlooking at the moon, of which she would take long observations from her\r\nchamber window. But whatever she looked at; sun, moon, stars, or\r\nbracelet; she looked no more at the Major. And the Major whistled, and\r\nstared, and wondered, and dodged about his room, and could make nothing\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll quite win my brother Paul\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, one day.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox turned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe grows more like Paul every day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox returned no other reply than by taking the little Paul in her\r\narms, and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mother, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose acquaintance I was to have\r\nmade through you, does he at all resemble her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Louisa\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was\xe2\x80\x94she was pretty, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, poor dear Fanny was interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after some\r\njudicial consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly interesting. She had not that air of\r\ncommanding superiority which one would somehow expect, almost as a\r\nmatter of course, to find in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife; nor had she that\r\nstrength and vigour of mind which such a man requires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was pleasing:\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick: \xe2\x80\x9cextremely so. And she\r\nmeant!\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear, how well poor Fanny meant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou Angel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Tox to little Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cYou Picture of your own\r\nPapa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the Major could have known how many hopes and ventures, what a\r\nmultitude of plans and speculations, rested on that baby head; and\r\ncould have seen them hovering, in all their heterogeneous confusion and\r\ndisorder, round the puckered cap of the unconscious little Paul; he\r\nmight have stared indeed. Then would he have recognised, among the\r\ncrowd, some few ambitious motes and beams belonging to Miss Tox; then\r\nwould he perhaps have understood the nature of that lady\xe2\x80\x99s faltering\r\ninvestment in the Dombey Firm.\r\n\r\nIf the child himself could have awakened in the night, and seen,\r\ngathered about his cradle-curtains, faint reflections of the dreams\r\nthat other people had of him, they might have scared him, with good\r\nreason. But he slumbered on, alike unconscious of the kind intentions\r\nof Miss Tox, the wonder of the Major, the early sorrows of his sister,\r\nand the stern visions of his father; and innocent that any spot of\r\nearth contained a Dombey or a Son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Further Progress, Growth and Character\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath the watching and attentive eyes of Time\xe2\x80\x94so far another\r\nMajor\xe2\x80\x94Paul\xe2\x80\x99s slumbers gradually changed. More and more light broke in\r\nupon them; distincter and distincter dreams disturbed them; an\r\naccumulating crowd of objects and impressions swarmed about his rest;\r\nand so he passed from babyhood to childhood, and became a talking,\r\nwalking, wondering Dombey.\r\n\r\nOn the downfall and banishment of Richards, the nursery may be said to\r\nhave been put into commission: as a Public Department is sometimes,\r\nwhen no individual Atlas can be found to support it The Commissioners\r\nwere, of course, Mrs Chick and Miss Tox: who devoted themselves to\r\ntheir duties with such astonishing ardour that Major Bagstock had every\r\nday some new reminder of his being forsaken, while Mr Chick, bereft of\r\ndomestic supervision, cast himself upon the gay world, dined at clubs\r\nand coffee-houses, smelt of smoke on three different occasions, went to\r\nthe play by himself, and in short, loosened (as Mrs Chick once told\r\nhim) every social bond, and moral obligation.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of his early promise, all this vigilance and care could\r\nnot make little Paul a thriving boy. Naturally delicate, perhaps, he\r\npined and wasted after the dismissal of his nurse, and, for a long\r\ntime, seemed but to wait his opportunity of gliding through their\r\nhands, and seeking his lost mother. This dangerous ground in his\r\nsteeple-chase towards manhood passed, he still found it very rough\r\nriding, and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course.\r\nEvery tooth was a break-neck fence, and every pimple in the measles a\r\nstone wall to him. He was down in every fit of the hooping-cough, and\r\nrolled upon and crushed by a whole field of small diseases, that came\r\ntrooping on each other\xe2\x80\x99s heels to prevent his getting up again. Some\r\nbird of prey got into his throat instead of the thrush; and the very\r\nchickens turning ferocious\xe2\x80\x94if they have anything to do with that infant\r\nmalady to which they lend their name\xe2\x80\x94worried him like tiger-cats.\r\n\r\nThe chill of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s christening had struck home, perhaps to some\r\nsensitive part of his nature, which could not recover itself in the\r\ncold shade of his father; but he was an unfortunate child from that\r\nday. Mrs Wickam often said she never see a dear so put upon.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam was a waiter\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94which would seem equivalent to being any\r\nother man\xe2\x80\x99s widow\xe2\x80\x94whose application for an engagement in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice had been favourably considered, on account of the apparent\r\nimpossibility of her having any followers, or anyone to follow; and\r\nwho, from within a day or two of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s sharp weaning, had been engaged\r\nas his nurse. Mrs Wickam was a meek woman, of a fair complexion, with\r\nher eyebrows always elevated, and her head always drooping; who was\r\nalways ready to pity herself, or to be pitied, or to pity anybody else;\r\nand who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an\r\nutterly forlorn and pitiable light, and bringing dreadful precedents to\r\nbear upon them, and deriving the greatest consolation from the exercise\r\nof that talent.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to observe, that no touch of this quality ever\r\nreached the magnificent knowledge of Mr Dombey. It would have been\r\nremarkable, indeed, if any had; when no one in the house\xe2\x80\x94not even Mrs\r\nChick or Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x94dared ever whisper to him that there had, on any one\r\noccasion, been the least reason for uneasiness in reference to little\r\nPaul. He had settled, within himself, that the child must necessarily\r\npass through a certain routine of minor maladies, and that the sooner\r\nhe did so the better. If he could have bought him off, or provided a\r\nsubstitute, as in the case of an unlucky drawing for the militia, he\r\nwould have been glad to do so, on liberal terms. But as this was not\r\nfeasible, he merely wondered, in his haughty manner, now and then, what\r\nNature meant by it; and comforted himself with the reflection that\r\nthere was another milestone passed upon the road, and that the great\r\nend of the journey lay so much the nearer. For the feeling uppermost in\r\nhis mind, now and constantly intensifying, and increasing in it as Paul\r\ngrew older, was impatience. Impatience for the time to come, when his\r\nvisions of their united consequence and grandeur would be triumphantly\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers tell us that selfishness is at the root of our best\r\nloves and affections. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s young child was, from the beginning,\r\nso distinctly important to him as a part of his own greatness, or\r\n(which is the same thing) of the greatness of Dombey and Son, that\r\nthere is no doubt his parental affection might have been easily traced,\r\nlike many a goodly superstructure of fair fame, to a very low\r\nfoundation. But he loved his son with all the love he had. If there\r\nwere a warm place in his frosty heart, his son occupied it; if its very\r\nhard surface could receive the impression of any image, the image of\r\nthat son was there; though not so much as an infant, or as a boy, but\r\nas a grown man\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cSon\xe2\x80\x9d of the Firm. Therefore he was impatient to\r\nadvance into the future, and to hurry over the intervening passages of\r\nhis history. Therefore he had little or no anxiety about them, in spite\r\nof his love; feeling as if the boy had a charmed life, and must become\r\nthe man with whom he held such constant communication in his thoughts,\r\nand for whom he planned and projected, as for an existing reality,\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nThus Paul grew to be nearly five years old. He was a pretty little\r\nfellow; though there was something wan and wistful in his small face,\r\nthat gave occasion to many significant shakes of Mrs Wickam\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\nmany long-drawn inspirations of Mrs Wickam\xe2\x80\x99s breath. His temper gave\r\nabundant promise of being imperious in after-life; and he had as\r\nhopeful an apprehension of his own importance, and the rightful\r\nsubservience of all other things and persons to it, as heart could\r\ndesire. He was childish and sportive enough at times, and not of a\r\nsullen disposition; but he had a strange, old-fashioned, thoughtful\r\nway, at other times, of sitting brooding in his miniature arm-chair,\r\nwhen he looked (and talked) like one of those terrible little Beings in\r\nthe Fairy tales, who, at a hundred and fifty or two hundred years of\r\nage, fantastically represent the children for whom they have been\r\nsubstituted. He would frequently be stricken with this precocious mood\r\nupstairs in the nursery; and would sometimes lapse into it suddenly,\r\nexclaiming that he was tired: even while playing with Florence, or\r\ndriving Miss Tox in single harness. But at no time did he fall into it\r\nso surely, as when, his little chair being carried down into his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s room, he sat there with him after dinner, by the fire. They\r\nwere the strangest pair at such a time that ever firelight shone upon.\r\nMr Dombey so erect and solemn, gazing at the glare; his little image,\r\nwith an old, old face, peering into the red perspective with the fixed\r\nand rapt attention of a sage. Mr Dombey entertaining complicated\r\nworldly schemes and plans; the little image entertaining Heaven knows\r\nwhat wild fancies, half-formed thoughts, and wandering speculations. Mr\r\nDombey stiff with starch and arrogance; the little image by\r\ninheritance, and in unconscious imitation. The two so very much alike,\r\nand yet so monstrously contrasted.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, when they had both been perfectly quiet for\r\na long time, and Mr Dombey only knew that the child was awake by\r\noccasionally glancing at his eye, where the bright fire was sparkling\r\nlike a jewel, little Paul broke silence thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! what\xe2\x80\x99s money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe abrupt question had such immediate reference to the subject of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, that Mr Dombey was quite disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is money, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, laying his hands upon the elbows of his little\r\nchair, and turning the old face up towards Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nmoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was in a difficulty. He would have liked to give him some\r\nexplanation involving the terms circulating-medium, currency,\r\ndepreciation of currency, paper, bullion, rates of exchange, value of\r\nprecious metals in the market, and so forth; but looking down at the\r\nlittle chair, and seeing what a long way down it was, he answered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold, and silver, and copper. Guineas, shillings, half-pence. You know\r\nwhat they are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know what they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, Papa. I\r\nmean what\xe2\x80\x99s money after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeaven and Earth, how old his face was as he turned it up again towards\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is money after all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, backing his chair a little,\r\nthat he might the better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous\r\natom that propounded such an inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, Papa, what can it do?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul, folding his arms (they\r\nwere hardly long enough to fold), and looking at the fire, and up at\r\nhim, and at the fire, and up at him again.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey drew his chair back to its former place, and patted him on\r\nthe head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know better by-and-by, my man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney,\r\nPaul, can do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d He took hold of the little hand, and beat it\r\nsoftly against one of his own, as he said so.\r\n\r\nBut Paul got his hand free as soon as he could; and rubbing it gently\r\nto and fro on the elbow of his chair, as if his wit were in the palm,\r\nand he were sharpening it\xe2\x80\x94and looking at the fire again, as though the\r\nfire had been his adviser and prompter\xe2\x80\x94repeated, after a short pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Anything\xe2\x80\x94almost,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything means everything, don\xe2\x80\x99t it, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his son: not\r\nobserving, or possibly not understanding, the qualification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt includes it: yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t money save me my Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncruel, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruel!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, settling his neckcloth, and seeming to resent\r\nthe idea. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. A good thing can\xe2\x80\x99t be cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, and can do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little fellow,\r\nthoughtfully, as he looked back at the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsave me my Mama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask the question of his father this time. Perhaps he had\r\nseen, with a child\xe2\x80\x99s quickness, that it had already made his father\r\nuncomfortable. But he repeated the thought aloud, as if it were quite\r\nan old one to him, and had troubled him very much; and sat with his\r\nchin resting on his hand, still cogitating and looking for an\r\nexplanation in the fire.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey having recovered from his surprise, not to say his alarm (for\r\nit was the very first occasion on which the child had ever broached the\r\nsubject of his mother to him, though he had had him sitting by his\r\nside, in this same manner, evening after evening), expounded to him how\r\nthat money, though a very potent spirit, never to be disparaged on any\r\naccount whatever, could not keep people alive whose time was come to\r\ndie; and how that we must all die, unfortunately, even in the City,\r\nthough we were never so rich. But how that money caused us to be\r\nhonoured, feared, respected, courted, and admired, and made us powerful\r\nand glorious in the eyes of all men; and how that it could, very often,\r\neven keep off death, for a long time together. How, for example, it had\r\nsecured to his Mama the services of Mr Pilkins, by which he, Paul, had\r\noften profited himself; likewise of the great Doctor Parker Peps, whom\r\nhe had never known. And how it could do all, that could be done. This,\r\nwith more to the same purpose, Mr Dombey instilled into the mind of his\r\nson, who listened attentively, and seemed to understand the greater\r\npart of what was said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t make me strong and quite well, either, Papa; can it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nPaul, after a short silence; rubbing his tiny hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are strong and quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh! the age of the face that was turned up again, with an expression,\r\nhalf of melancholy, half of slyness, on it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as strong and well as such little people usually are? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence is older than I am, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not as strong and well as\r\nFlorence, \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child; \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe that when\r\nFlorence was as little as me, she could play a great deal longer at a\r\ntime without tiring herself. I am so tired sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said little\r\nPaul, warming his hands, and looking in between the bars of the grate,\r\nas if some ghostly puppet-show were performing there, \xe2\x80\x9cand my bones\r\nache so (Wickam says it\xe2\x80\x99s my bones), that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! But that\xe2\x80\x99s at night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, drawing his own chair closer\r\nto his son\xe2\x80\x99s, and laying his hand gently on his back; \xe2\x80\x9clittle people\r\nshould be tired at night, for then they sleep well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at night, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s in the day;\r\nand I lie down in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and she sings to me. At night I dream\r\nabout such cu-ri-ous things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went on, warming his hands again, and thinking about them, like\r\nan old man or a young goblin.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was so astonished, and so uncomfortable, and so perfectly at\r\na loss how to pursue the conversation, that he could only sit looking\r\nat his son by the light of the fire, with his hand resting on his back,\r\nas if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction. Once he\r\nadvanced his other hand, and turned the contemplative face towards his\r\nown for a moment. But it sought the fire again as soon as he released\r\nit; and remained, addressed towards the flickering blaze, until the\r\nnurse appeared, to summon him to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want Florence to come for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come with your poor Nurse Wickam, Master Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nthat attendant, with great pathos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paul, composing himself in his arm-chair again,\r\nlike the master of the house.\r\n\r\nInvoking a blessing upon his innocence, Mrs Wickam withdrew, and\r\npresently Florence appeared in her stead. The child immediately started\r\nup with sudden readiness and animation, and raised towards his father\r\nin bidding him good-night, a countenance so much brighter, so much\r\nyounger, and so much more child-like altogether, that Mr Dombey, while\r\nhe felt greatly reassured by the change, was quite amazed at it.\r\n\r\nAfter they had left the room together, he thought he heard a soft voice\r\nsinging; and remembering that Paul had said his sister sung to him, he\r\nhad the curiosity to open the door and listen, and look after them. She\r\nwas toiling up the great, wide, vacant staircase, with him in her arms;\r\nhis head was lying on her shoulder, one of his arms thrown negligently\r\nround her neck. So they went, toiling up; she singing all the way, and\r\nPaul sometimes crooning out a feeble accompaniment. Mr Dombey looked\r\nafter them until they reached the top of the staircase\xe2\x80\x94not without\r\nhalting to rest by the way\xe2\x80\x94and passed out of his sight; and then he\r\nstill stood gazing upwards, until the dull rays of the moon, glimmering\r\nin a melancholy manner through the dim skylight, sent him back to his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick and Miss Tox were convoked in council at dinner next day; and\r\nwhen the cloth was removed, Mr Dombey opened the proceedings by\r\nrequiring to be informed, without any gloss or reservation, whether\r\nthere was anything the matter with Paul, and what Mr Pilkins said about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the child is hardly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cas stout as I could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your usual happy\r\ndiscrimination, which I am weak enough to envy you, every time I am in\r\nyour company; and so I think is Miss Tox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, softly, \xe2\x80\x9chow could it be otherwise?\r\nPresumptuous as it is to aspire to such a level; still, if the bird of\r\nnight may\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ll not trouble Mr Dombey with the sentiment. It merely\r\nrelates to the Bulbul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey bent his head in stately recognition of the Bulbuls as an\r\nold-established body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your usual happy discrimination, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs\r\nChick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have hit the point at once. Our darling is altogether as\r\nstout as we could wish. The fact is, that his mind is too much for him.\r\nHis soul is a great deal too large for his frame. I am sure the way in\r\nwhich that dear child talks!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cno one\r\nwould believe. His expressions, Lucretia, only yesterday upon the\r\nsubject of Funerals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, interrupting her testily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat some of\r\nthose persons upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child. He was\r\nspeaking to me last night about his\xe2\x80\x94about his Bones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey,\r\nlaying an irritated stress upon the word. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth has anybody to\r\ndo with the\xe2\x80\x94with the\xe2\x80\x94Bones of my son? He is not a living skeleton, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery far from it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with unspeakable expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her brother. \xe2\x80\x9cFunerals again! who talks to the\r\nchild of funerals? We are not undertakers, or mutes, or grave-diggers,\r\nI believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery far from it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs Chick, with the same profound\r\nexpression as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen who puts such things into his head?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cReally I\r\nwas quite dismayed and shocked last night. Who puts such things into\r\nhis head, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x9cit is of no\r\nuse inquiring. I do not think, I will tell you candidly that Wickam is\r\na person of very cheerful spirit, or what one would call a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA daughter of Momus,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Tox softly suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is exceedingly attentive and\r\nuseful, and not at all presumptuous; indeed I never saw a more biddable\r\nwoman. I would say that for her, if I was put upon my trial before a\r\nCourt of Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! you are not put upon your trial before a Court of Justice, at\r\npresent, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, chafing, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore it don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, in a warning voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be spoken\r\nto kindly, or there is an end of me,\xe2\x80\x9d at the same time a premonitory\r\nredness developed itself in Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids which was an invariable\r\nsign of rain, unless the weather changed directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was inquiring, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey, in an altered voice, and\r\nafter a decent interval, \xe2\x80\x9cabout Paul\xe2\x80\x99s health and actual state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, in the tone of one who was summing\r\nup what had been previously quite agreed upon, instead of saying it all\r\nfor the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cis a little weakened by that last attack, and is\r\nnot in quite such vigorous health as we could wish; and if he has some\r\ntemporary weakness in his system, and does occasionally seem about to\r\nlose, for the moment, the use of his\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick was afraid to say limbs, after Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s recent objection\r\nto bones, and therefore waited for a suggestion from Miss Tox, who,\r\ntrue to her office, hazarded \xe2\x80\x9cmembers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMembers!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the medical gentleman mentioned legs this morning, my dear\r\nLouisa, did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course he did, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick, mildly\r\nreproachful. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask me? You heard him. I say, if our dear\r\nPaul should lose, for the moment, the use of his legs, these are\r\ncasualties common to many children at his time of life, and not to be\r\nprevented by any care or caution. The sooner you understand that, Paul,\r\nand admit that, the better. If you have any doubt as to the amount of\r\ncare, and caution, and affection, and self-sacrifice, that has been\r\nbestowed upon little Paul, I should wish to refer the question to your\r\nmedical attendant, or to any of your dependants in this house. Call\r\nTowlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe he has no prejudice in our\r\nfavour; quite the contrary. I should wish to hear what accusation\r\nTowlinson can make!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you must know, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquestion your natural devotion to, and regard for, the future head of\r\nmy house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut really you are very\r\nodd, and sometimes talk very strangely, though without meaning it, I\r\nknow. If your dear boy\xe2\x80\x99s soul is too much for his body, Paul, you\r\nshould remember whose fault that is\xe2\x80\x94who he takes after, I mean\xe2\x80\x94and make\r\nthe best of it. He\xe2\x80\x99s as like his Papa as he can be. People have noticed\r\nit in the streets. The very beadle, I am informed, observed it, so long\r\nago as at his christening. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very respectable man, with children\r\nof his own. He ought to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Pilkins saw Paul this morning, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he did,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox and myself were present.\r\nMiss Tox and myself are always present. We make a point of it. Mr\r\nPilkins has seen him for some days past, and a very clever man I\r\nbelieve him to be. He says it is nothing to speak of; which I can\r\nconfirm, if that is any consolation; but he recommended, today,\r\nsea-air. Very wisely, Paul, I feel convinced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSea-air,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Dombey, looking at his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be made uneasy by, in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nGeorge and Frederick were both ordered sea-air, when they were about\r\nhis age; and I have been ordered it myself a great many times. I quite\r\nagree with you, Paul, that perhaps topics may be incautiously mentioned\r\nupstairs before him, which it would be as well for his little mind not\r\nto expatiate upon; but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see how that is to be helped, in\r\nthe case of a child of his quickness. If he were a common child, there\r\nwould be nothing in it. I must say I think, with Miss Tox, that a short\r\nabsence from this house, the air of Brighton, and the bodily and mental\r\ntraining of so judicious a person as Mrs Pipchin for instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mrs Pipchin, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey; aghast at this familiar\r\nintroduction of a name he had never heard before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his sister, \xe2\x80\x9cis an elderly\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94Miss Tox knows her whole history\xe2\x80\x94who has for some time devoted all\r\nthe energies of her mind, with the greatest success, to the study and\r\ntreatment of infancy, and who has been extremely well connected. Her\r\nhusband broke his heart in\xe2\x80\x94how did you say her husband broke his heart,\r\nmy dear? I forget the precise circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn pumping water out of the Peruvian Mines,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot being a Pumper himself, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, glancing at\r\nher brother; and it really did seem necessary to offer the explanation,\r\nfor Miss Tox had spoken of him as if he had died at the handle; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhaving invested money in the speculation, which failed. I believe that\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s management of children is quite astonishing. I have heard\r\nit commended in private circles ever since I was\xe2\x80\x94dear me\xe2\x80\x94how high!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs\r\nChick\xe2\x80\x99s eye wandered about the bookcase near the bust of Mr Pitt, which\r\nwas about ten feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I should say of Mrs Pipchin, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Tox,\r\nwith an ingenuous blush, \xe2\x80\x9chaving been so pointedly referred to, that\r\nthe encomium which has been passed upon her by your sweet sister is\r\nwell merited. Many ladies and gentleman, now grown up to be interesting\r\nmembers of society, have been indebted to her care. The humble\r\nindividual who addresses you was once under her charge. I believe\r\njuvenile nobility itself is no stranger to her establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand that this respectable matron keeps an establishment,\r\nMiss Tox?\xe2\x80\x9d the Mr Dombey, condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined that lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I am justified\r\nin calling it so. It is not a Preparatory School by any means. Should I\r\nexpress my meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, with peculiar sweetness, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ndesignated it an infantine Boarding-House of a very select\r\ndescription?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an exceedingly limited and particular scale,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mrs Chick,\r\nwith a glance at her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Exclusion itself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\nThere was something in this. Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s husband having broken his\r\nheart of the Peruvian mines was good. It had a rich sound. Besides, Mr\r\nDombey was in a state almost amounting to consternation at the idea of\r\nPaul remaining where he was one hour after his removal had been\r\nrecommended by the medical practitioner. It was a stoppage and delay\r\nupon the road the child must traverse, slowly at the best, before the\r\ngoal was reached. Their recommendation of Mrs Pipchin had great weight\r\nwith him; for he knew that they were jealous of any interference with\r\ntheir charge, and he never for a moment took it into account that they\r\nmight be solicitous to divide a responsibility, of which he had, as\r\nshown just now, his own established views. Broke his heart of the\r\nPeruvian mines, mused Mr Dombey. Well! a very respectable way of doing\r\nIt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing we should decide, on to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries, to send Paul\r\ndown to Brighton to this lady, who would go with him?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr\r\nDombey, after some reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could send the child anywhere at present without\r\nFlorence, my dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his sister, hesitating. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nan infatuation with him. He\xe2\x80\x99s very young, you know, and has his\r\nfancies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey turned his head away, and going slowly to the bookcase, and\r\nunlocking it, brought back a book to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody else, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without looking up, and turning over\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWickam, of course. Wickam would be quite sufficient, I should say,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cPaul being in such hands as Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s, you\r\ncould hardly send anybody who would be a further check upon her. You\r\nwould go down yourself once a week at least, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey; and sat looking at one page for an hour\r\nafterwards, without reading one word.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated Mrs Pipchin was a marvellous ill-favoured,\r\nill-conditioned old lady, of a stooping figure, with a mottled face,\r\nlike bad marble, a hook nose, and a hard grey eye, that looked as if it\r\nmight have been hammered at on an anvil without sustaining any injury.\r\nForty years at least had elapsed since the Peruvian mines had been the\r\ndeath of Mr Pipchin; but his relict still wore black bombazeen, of such\r\na lustreless, deep, dead, sombre shade, that gas itself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t light\r\nher up after dark, and her presence was a quencher to any number of\r\ncandles. She was generally spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9ca great manager\xe2\x80\x9d of children;\r\nand the secret of her management was, to give them everything that they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like, and nothing that they did\xe2\x80\x94which was found to sweeten their\r\ndispositions very much. She was such a bitter old lady, that one was\r\ntempted to believe there had been some mistake in the application of\r\nthe Peruvian machinery, and that all her waters of gladness and milk of\r\nhuman kindness, had been pumped out dry, instead of the mines.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of this ogress and child-queller was in a steep by-street at\r\nBrighton; where the soil was more than usually chalky, flinty, and\r\nsterile, and the houses were more than usually brittle and thin; where\r\nthe small front-gardens had the unaccountable property of producing\r\nnothing but marigolds, whatever was sown in them; and where snails were\r\nconstantly discovered holding on to the street doors, and other public\r\nplaces they were not expected to ornament, with the tenacity of\r\ncupping-glasses. In the winter time the air couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be got out of the\r\nCastle, and in the summer time it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be got in. There was such a\r\ncontinual reverberation of wind in it, that it sounded like a great\r\nshell, which the inhabitants were obliged to hold to their ears night\r\nand day, whether they liked it or no. It was not, naturally, a\r\nfresh-smelling house; and in the window of the front parlour, which was\r\nnever opened, Mrs Pipchin kept a collection of plants in pots, which\r\nimparted an earthy flavour of their own to the establishment. However\r\nchoice examples of their kind, too, these plants were of a kind\r\npeculiarly adapted to the embowerment of Mrs Pipchin. There were\r\nhalf-a-dozen specimens of the cactus, writhing round bits of lath, like\r\nhairy serpents; another specimen shooting out broad claws, like a green\r\nlobster; several creeping vegetables, possessed of sticky and adhesive\r\nleaves; and one uncomfortable flower-pot hanging to the ceiling, which\r\nappeared to have boiled over, and tickling people underneath with its\r\nlong green ends, reminded them of spiders\xe2\x80\x94in which Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling was uncommonly prolific, though perhaps it challenged\r\ncompetition still more proudly, in the season, in point of earwigs.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s scale of charges being high, however, to all who could\r\nafford to pay, and Mrs Pipchin very seldom sweetening the equable\r\nacidity of her nature in favour of anybody, she was held to be an old\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clady of remarkable firmness, who was quite scientific in her knowledge\r\nof the childish character.\xe2\x80\x9d On this reputation, and on the broken heart\r\nof Mr Pipchin, she had contrived, taking one year with another, to eke\r\nout a tolerable sufficient living since her husband\xe2\x80\x99s demise. Within\r\nthree days after Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x99s first allusion to her, this excellent old\r\nlady had the satisfaction of anticipating a handsome addition to her\r\ncurrent receipts, from the pocket of Mr Dombey; and of receiving\r\nFlorence and her little brother Paul, as inmates of the Castle.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick and Miss Tox, who had brought them down on the previous night\r\n(which they all passed at an Hotel), had just driven away from the\r\ndoor, on their journey home again; and Mrs Pipchin, with her back to\r\nthe fire, stood, reviewing the new-comers, like an old soldier. Mrs\r\nPipchin\xe2\x80\x99s middle-aged niece, her good-natured and devoted slave, but\r\npossessing a gaunt and iron-bound aspect, and much afflicted with boils\r\non her nose, was divesting Master Bitherstone of the clean collar he\r\nhad worn on parade. Miss Pankey, the only other little boarder at\r\npresent, had that moment been walked off to the Castle Dungeon (an\r\nempty apartment at the back, devoted to correctional purposes), for\r\nhaving sniffed thrice, in the presence of visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin to Paul, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you think you shall like\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall like you at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go\r\naway. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It\xe2\x80\x99s mine,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very nasty one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a worse place in it than this though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere we shut up our bad boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he ever been in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul: pointing out Master Bitherstone.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin nodded assent; and Paul had enough to do, for the rest of\r\nthat day, in surveying Master Bitherstone from head to foot, and\r\nwatching all the workings of his countenance, with the interest\r\nattaching to a boy of mysterious and terrible experiences.\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock there was a dinner, chiefly of the farinaceous and\r\nvegetable kind, when Miss Pankey (a mild little blue-eyed morsel of a\r\nchild, who was shampoo\xe2\x80\x99d every morning, and seemed in danger of being\r\nrubbed away, altogether) was led in from captivity by the ogress\r\nherself, and instructed that nobody who sniffed before visitors ever\r\nwent to Heaven. When this great truth had been thoroughly impressed\r\nupon her, she was regaled with rice; and subsequently repeated the form\r\nof grace established in the Castle, in which there was a special\r\nclause, thanking Mrs Pipchin for a good dinner. Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s niece,\r\nBerinthia, took cold pork. Mrs Pipchin, whose constitution required\r\nwarm nourishment, made a special repast of mutton-chops, which were\r\nbrought in hot and hot, between two plates, and smelt very nice.\r\n\r\nAs it rained after dinner, and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go out walking on the\r\nbeach, and Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s constitution required rest after chops, they\r\nwent away with Berry (otherwise Berinthia) to the Dungeon; an empty\r\nroom looking out upon a chalk wall and a water-butt, and made ghastly\r\nby a ragged fireplace without any stove in it. Enlivened by company,\r\nhowever, this was the best place after all; for Berry played with them\r\nthere, and seemed to enjoy a game at romps as much as they did; until\r\nMrs Pipchin knocking angrily at the wall, like the Cock Lane Ghost\r\nrevived, they left off, and Berry told them stories in a whisper until\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\nFor tea there was plenty of milk and water, and bread and butter, with\r\na little black tea-pot for Mrs Pipchin and Berry, and buttered toast\r\nunlimited for Mrs Pipchin, which was brought in, hot and hot, like the\r\nchops. Though Mrs Pipchin got very greasy, outside, over this dish, it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to lubricate her internally, at all; for she was as fierce\r\nas ever, and the hard grey eye knew no softening.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Berry brought out a little work-box, with the Royal Pavilion\r\non the lid, and fell to working busily; while Mrs Pipchin, having put\r\non her spectacles and opened a great volume bound in green baize, began\r\nto nod. And whenever Mrs Pipchin caught herself falling forward into\r\nthe fire, and woke up, she filliped Master Bitherstone on the nose for\r\nnodding too.\r\n\r\nAt last it was the children\xe2\x80\x99s bedtime, and after prayers they went to\r\nbed. As little Miss Pankey was afraid of sleeping alone in the dark,\r\nMrs Pipchin always made a point of driving her upstairs herself, like a\r\nsheep; and it was cheerful to hear Miss Pankey moaning long afterwards,\r\nin the least eligible chamber, and Mrs Pipchin now and then going in to\r\nshake her. At about half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the odour of a warm\r\nsweet-bread (Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s constitution wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep without\r\nsweet-bread) diversified the prevailing fragrance of the house, which\r\nMrs Wickam said was \xe2\x80\x9ca smell of building;\xe2\x80\x9d and slumber fell upon the\r\nCastle shortly after.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast next morning was like the tea over night, except that Mrs\r\nPipchin took her roll instead of toast, and seemed a little more irate\r\nwhen it was over. Master Bitherstone read aloud to the rest a pedigree\r\nfrom Genesis (judiciously selected by Mrs Pipchin), getting over the\r\nnames with the ease and clearness of a person tumbling up the\r\ntreadmill. That done, Miss Pankey was borne away to be shampoo\xe2\x80\x99d; and\r\nMaster Bitherstone to have something else done to him with salt water,\r\nfrom which he always returned very blue and dejected. Paul and Florence\r\nwent out in the meantime on the beach with Wickam\xe2\x80\x94who was constantly in\r\ntears\xe2\x80\x94and at about noon Mrs Pipchin presided over some Early Readings.\r\nIt being a part of Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s system not to encourage a child\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nto develop and expand itself like a young flower, but to open it by\r\nforce like an oyster, the moral of these lessons was usually of a\r\nviolent and stunning character: the hero\xe2\x80\x94a naughty boy\xe2\x80\x94seldom, in the\r\nmildest catastrophe, being finished off anything less than a lion, or a\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nSuch was life at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s. On Saturday Mr Dombey came down; and\r\nFlorence and Paul would go to his Hotel, and have tea. They passed the\r\nwhole of Sunday with him, and generally rode out before dinner; and on\r\nthese occasions Mr Dombey seemed to grow, like Falstaff\xe2\x80\x99s assailants,\r\nand instead of being one man in buckram, to become a dozen. Sunday\r\nevening was the most melancholy evening in the week; for Mrs Pipchin\r\nalways made a point of being particularly cross on Sunday nights. Miss\r\nPankey was generally brought back from an aunt\xe2\x80\x99s at Rottingdean, in\r\ndeep distress; and Master Bitherstone, whose relatives were all in\r\nIndia, and who was required to sit, between the services, in an erect\r\nposition with his head against the parlour wall, neither moving hand\r\nnor foot, suffered so acutely in his young spirits that he once asked\r\nFlorence, on a Sunday night, if she could give him any idea of the way\r\nback to Bengal.\r\n\r\nBut it was generally said that Mrs Pipchin was a woman of system with\r\nchildren; and no doubt she was. Certainly the wild ones went home tame\r\nenough, after sojourning for a few months beneath her hospitable roof.\r\nIt was generally said, too, that it was highly creditable of Mrs\r\nPipchin to have devoted herself to this way of life, and to have made\r\nsuch a sacrifice of her feelings, and such a resolute stand against her\r\ntroubles, when Mr Pipchin broke his heart in the Peruvian mines.\r\n\r\nAt this exemplary old lady, Paul would sit staring in his little\r\narm-chair by the fire, for any length of time. He never seemed to know\r\nwhat weariness was, when he was looking fixedly at Mrs Pipchin. He was\r\nnot fond of her; he was not afraid of her; but in those old, old moods\r\nof his, she seemed to have a grotesque attraction for him. There he\r\nwould sit, looking at her, and warming his hands, and looking at her,\r\nuntil he sometimes quite confounded Mrs Pipchin, Ogress as she was.\r\nOnce she asked him, when they were alone, what he was thinking about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, without the least reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you thinking about me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking how old you must be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say such things as that, young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\ndame. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll never do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s not polite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, snappishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot polite?\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not polite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, innocently, \xe2\x80\x9cto eat all the mutton chops\r\nand toast\xe2\x80\x9d, Wickam says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWickam,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin, colouring, \xe2\x80\x9cis a wicked, impudent,\r\nbold-faced hussy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember the story of the\r\nlittle boy that was gored to death by a mad bull for asking questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the bull was mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, \xe2\x80\x9chow did he know that the boy had\r\nasked questions? Nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe that story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Pipchin, amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it should happen to have been a tame bull, you little Infidel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\nAs Paul had not considered the subject in that light, and had founded\r\nhis conclusions on the alleged lunacy of the bull, he allowed himself\r\nto be put down for the present. But he sat turning it over in his mind,\r\nwith such an obvious intention of fixing Mrs Pipchin presently, that\r\neven that hardy old lady deemed it prudent to retreat until he should\r\nhave forgotten the subject.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, Mrs Pipchin appeared to have something of the same odd\r\nkind of attraction towards Paul, as Paul had towards her. She would\r\nmake him move his chair to her side of the fire, instead of sitting\r\nopposite; and there he would remain in a nook between Mrs Pipchin and\r\nthe fender, with all the light of his little face absorbed into the\r\nblack bombazeen drapery, studying every line and wrinkle of her\r\ncountenance, and peering at the hard grey eye, until Mrs Pipchin was\r\nsometimes fain to shut it, on pretence of dozing. Mrs Pipchin had an\r\nold black cat, who generally lay coiled upon the centre foot of the\r\nfender, purring egotistically, and winking at the fire until the\r\ncontracted pupils of his eyes were like two notes of admiration. The\r\ngood old lady might have been\xe2\x80\x94not to record it disrespectfully\xe2\x80\x94a witch,\r\nand Paul and the cat her two familiars, as they all sat by the fire\r\ntogether. It would have been quite in keeping with the appearance of\r\nthe party if they had all sprung up the chimney in a high wind one\r\nnight, and never been heard of any more.\r\n\r\nThis, however, never came to pass. The cat, and Paul, and Mrs Pipchin,\r\nwere constantly to be found in their usual places after dark; and Paul,\r\neschewing the companionship of Master Bitherstone, went on studying Mrs\r\nPipchin, and the cat, and the fire, night after night, as if they were\r\na book of necromancy, in three volumes.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam put her own construction on Paul\xe2\x80\x99s eccentricities; and being\r\nconfirmed in her low spirits by a perplexed view of chimneys from the\r\nroom where she was accustomed to sit, and by the noise of the wind, and\r\nby the general dulness (gashliness was Mrs Wickam\xe2\x80\x99s strong expression)\r\nof her present life, deduced the most dismal reflections from the\r\nforegoing premises. It was a part of Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s policy to prevent\r\nher own \xe2\x80\x9cyoung hussy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s generic name for female\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x94from communicating with Mrs Wickam: to which end she devoted\r\nmuch of her time to concealing herself behind doors, and springing out\r\non that devoted maiden, whenever she made an approach towards Mrs\r\nWickam\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. But Berry was free to hold what converse she could\r\nin that quarter, consistently with the discharge of the multifarious\r\nduties at which she toiled incessantly from morning to night; and to\r\nBerry Mrs Wickam unburdened her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty fellow he is when he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d said Berry, stopping to\r\nlook at Paul in bed, one night when she took up Mrs Wickam\xe2\x80\x99s supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs Wickam. \xe2\x80\x9cHe need be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s not ugly when he\xe2\x80\x99s awake,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Berry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Oh, no. No more was my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Betsey Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nWickam.\r\n\r\nBerry looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas\r\nbetween Paul Dombey and Mrs Wickam\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Betsey Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Wickam went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cdied just like his Mama.\r\nMy Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s child took on just as Master Paul do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTook on! You don\xe2\x80\x99t think he grieves for his Mama, sure?\xe2\x80\x9d argued Berry,\r\nsitting down on the side of the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything about\r\nher, you know, Mrs Wickam. It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam \xe2\x80\x9cNo more did my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s child. But my\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x99s child said very strange things sometimes, and looked very\r\nstrange, and went on very strange, and was very strange altogether. My\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x99s child made people\xe2\x80\x99s blood run cold, some times, she did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Berry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sat up all night alone with Betsey Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nWickam, \xe2\x80\x9cnot if you\xe2\x80\x99d have put Wickam into business next morning for\r\nhimself. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it, Miss Berry.\r\n\r\nMiss Berry naturally asked why not? But Mrs Wickam, agreeably to the\r\nusage of some ladies in her condition, pursued her own branch of the\r\nsubject, without any compunction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetsey Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, \xe2\x80\x9cwas as sweet a child as I could wish\r\nto see. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see a sweeter. Everything that a child could\r\nhave in the way of illnesses, Betsey Jane had come through. The cramps\r\nwas as common to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, \xe2\x80\x9cas biles is to yourself, Miss\r\nBerry.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Berry involuntarily wrinkled her nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Betsey Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, lowering her voice, and looking\r\nround the room, and towards Paul in bed, \xe2\x80\x9chad been minded, in her\r\ncradle, by her departed mother. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say how, nor I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nwhen, nor I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether the dear child knew it or not, but\r\nBetsey Jane had been watched by her mother, Miss Berry!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs\r\nWickam, with a very white face, and with watery eyes, and with a\r\ntremulous voice, again looked fearfully round the room, and towards\r\nPaul in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Berry\xe2\x80\x94somewhat resentful of the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may say nonsense! I ain\xe2\x80\x99t offended, Miss. I hope you may be able\r\nto think in your own conscience that it is nonsense; you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your\r\nspirits all the better for it in this\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my being so free\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthis burying-ground of a place; which is wearing of me down. Master\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s a little restless in his sleep. Pat his back, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berry, gently doing what she was asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he has been nursed by his mother, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetsey Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Wickam in her most solemn tones, \xe2\x80\x9cwas put\r\nupon as that child has been put upon, and changed as that child has\r\nchanged. I have seen her sit, often and often, think, think, thinking,\r\nlike him. I have seen her look, often and often, old, old, old, like\r\nhim. I have heard her, many a time, talk just like him. I consider that\r\nchild and Betsey Jane on the same footing entirely, Miss Berry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s child alive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Berry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss, she is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Wickam with an air of triumph,\r\nfor it was evident. Miss Berry expected the reverse; \xe2\x80\x9cand is married to\r\na silver-chaser. Oh yes, Miss, SHE is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, laying\r\nstrong stress on her nominative case.\r\n\r\nIt being clear that somebody was dead, Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s niece inquired who\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to make you uneasy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Wickam, pursuing her\r\nsupper. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the surest way of being asked again. Miss Berry repeated her\r\nquestion, therefore; and after some resistance, and reluctance, Mrs\r\nWickam laid down her knife, and again glancing round the room and at\r\nPaul in bed, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe took fancies to people; whimsical fancies, some of them; others,\r\naffections that one might expect to see\xe2\x80\x94only stronger than common. They\r\nall died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was so very unexpected and awful to Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s niece, that she\r\nsat upright on the hard edge of the bedstead, breathing short, and\r\nsurveying her informant with looks of undisguised alarm.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam shook her left fore-finger stealthily towards the bed where\r\nFlorence lay; then turned it upside down, and made several emphatic\r\npoints at the floor; immediately below which was the parlour in which\r\nMrs Pipchin habitually consumed the toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember my words, Miss Berry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, \xe2\x80\x9cand be thankful that\r\nMaster Paul is not too fond of you. I am, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not too fond of me,\r\nI assure you; though there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to live for\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my\r\nbeing so free\xe2\x80\x94in this jail of a house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Berry\xe2\x80\x99s emotion might have led to her patting Paul too hard on the\r\nback, or might have produced a cessation of that soothing monotony, but\r\nhe turned in his bed just now, and, presently awaking, sat up in it\r\nwith his hair hot and wet from the effects of some childish dream, and\r\nasked for Florence.\r\n\r\nShe was out of her own bed at the first sound of his voice; and bending\r\nover his pillow immediately, sang him to sleep again. Mrs Wickam\r\nshaking her head, and letting fall several tears, pointed out the\r\nlittle group to Berry, and turned her eyes up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s asleep now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter go to bed again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs Wickam, and she shook her head again, expressing to\r\nthe watchful Berry, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be cold enough, some of us, by and by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerry took the frugal supper-tray, with which Mrs Wickam had by this\r\ntime done, and bade her good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wickam softly. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night! Your aunt is\r\nan old lady, Miss Berry, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what you must have looked for,\r\noften.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis consolatory farewell, Mrs Wickam accompanied with a look of\r\nheartfelt anguish; and being left alone with the two children again,\r\nand becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully, she\r\nindulged in melancholy\xe2\x80\x94that cheapest and most accessible of\r\nluxuries\xe2\x80\x94until she was overpowered by slumber.\r\n\r\nAlthough the niece of Mrs Pipchin did not expect to find that exemplary\r\ndragon prostrate on the hearth-rug when she went downstairs, she was\r\nrelieved to find her unusually fractious and severe, and with every\r\npresent appearance of intending to live a long time to be a comfort to\r\nall who knew her. Nor had she any symptoms of declining, in the course\r\nof the ensuing week, when the constitutional viands still continued to\r\ndisappear in regular succession, notwithstanding that Paul studied her\r\nas attentively as ever, and occupied his usual seat between the black\r\nskirts and the fender, with unwavering constancy.\r\n\r\nBut as Paul himself was no stronger at the expiration of that time than\r\nhe had been on his first arrival, though he looked much healthier in\r\nthe face, a little carriage was got for him, in which he could lie at\r\nhis ease, with an alphabet and other elementary works of reference, and\r\nbe wheeled down to the sea-side. Consistent in his odd tastes, the\r\nchild set aside a ruddy-faced lad who was proposed as the drawer of\r\nthis carriage, and selected, instead, his grandfather\xe2\x80\x94a weazen, old,\r\ncrab-faced man, in a suit of battered oilskin, who had got tough and\r\nstringy from long pickling in salt water, and who smelt like a weedy\r\nsea-beach when the tide is out.\r\n\r\nWith this notable attendant to pull him along, and Florence always\r\nwalking by his side, and the despondent Wickam bringing up the rear, he\r\nwent down to the margin of the ocean every day; and there he would sit\r\nor lie in his carriage for hours together: never so distressed as by\r\nthe company of children\xe2\x80\x94Florence alone excepted, always.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to any child who came to bear\r\nhim company. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome small voice, near his ear, would ask him how he was, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very well, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he would answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you had better go\r\nand play, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he would turn his head, and watch the child away, and say to\r\nFlorence, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any others, do we? Kiss me, Floy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had even a dislike, at such times, to the company of Wickam, and was\r\nwell pleased when she strolled away, as she generally did, to pick up\r\nshells and acquaintances. His favourite spot was quite a lonely one,\r\nfar away from most loungers; and with Florence sitting by his side at\r\nwork, or reading to him, or talking to him, and the wind blowing on his\r\nface, and the water coming up among the wheels of his bed, he wanted\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said one day, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s India, where that boy\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long, long distance off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, raising her eyes\r\nfrom her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeeks off?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes dear. Many weeks\xe2\x80\x99 journey, night and day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were in India, Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, after being silent for a\r\nminute, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\xe2\x80\x94what is it that Mama did? I forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoved me!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I love you now, Floy? What is it?\xe2\x80\x94Died. If you were in\r\nIndia, I should die, Floy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly put her work aside, and laid her head down on his pillow,\r\ncaressing him. And so would she, she said, if he were there. He would\r\nbe better soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am a great deal better now!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. I\r\nmean that I should die of being so sorry and so lonely, Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother time, in the same place, he fell asleep, and slept quietly for\r\na long time. Awaking suddenly, he listened, started up, and sat\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nFlorence asked him what he thought he heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what it says,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, looking steadily in her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sea\xe2\x80\x9d Floy, what is it that it keeps on saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him that it was only the noise of the rolling waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know that they are always saying something.\r\nAlways the same thing. What place is over there?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose up, looking\r\neagerly at the horizon.\r\n\r\nShe told him that there was another country opposite, but he said he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that: he meant further away\xe2\x80\x94farther away!\r\n\r\nVery often afterwards, in the midst of their talk, he would break off,\r\nto try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying; and\r\nwould rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region, far\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nIn which the Wooden Midshipman gets into Trouble\r\n\r\n\r\nThat spice of romance and love of the marvellous, of which there was a\r\npretty strong infusion in the nature of young Walter Gay, and which the\r\nguardianship of his Uncle, old Solomon Gills, had not very much\r\nweakened by the waters of stern practical experience, was the occasion\r\nof his attaching an uncommon and delightful interest to the adventure\r\nof Florence with Good Mrs Brown. He pampered and cherished it in his\r\nmemory, especially that part of it with which he had been associated:\r\nuntil it became the spoiled child of his fancy, and took its own way,\r\nand did what it liked with it.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of those incidents, and his own share in them, may\r\nhave been made the more captivating, perhaps, by the weekly dreamings\r\nof old Sol and Captain Cuttle on Sundays. Hardly a Sunday passed,\r\nwithout mysterious references being made by one or other of those\r\nworthy chums to Richard Whittington; and the latter gentleman had even\r\ngone so far as to purchase a ballad of considerable antiquity, that had\r\nlong fluttered among many others, chiefly expressive of maritime\r\nsentiments, on a dead wall in the Commercial Road: which poetical\r\nperformance set forth the courtship and nuptials of a promising young\r\ncoal-whipper with a certain \xe2\x80\x9clovely Peg,\xe2\x80\x9d the accomplished daughter of\r\nthe master and part-owner of a Newcastle collier. In this stirring\r\nlegend, Captain Cuttle descried a profound metaphysical bearing on the\r\ncase of Walter and Florence; and it excited him so much, that on very\r\nfestive occasions, as birthdays and a few other non-Dominical holidays,\r\nhe would roar through the whole song in the little back parlour; making\r\nan amazing shake on the word Pe-e-eg, with which every verse concluded,\r\nin compliment to the heroine of the piece.\r\n\r\nBut a frank, free-spirited, open-hearted boy, is not much given to\r\nanalysing the nature of his own feelings, however strong their hold\r\nupon him: and Walter would have found it difficult to decide this\r\npoint. He had a great affection for the wharf where he had encountered\r\nFlorence, and for the streets (albeit not enchanting in themselves) by\r\nwhich they had come home. The shoes that had so often tumbled off by\r\nthe way, he preserved in his own room; and, sitting in the little back\r\nparlour of an evening, he had drawn a whole gallery of fancy portraits\r\nof Good Mrs Brown. It may be that he became a little smarter in his\r\ndress after that memorable occasion; and he certainly liked in his\r\nleisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse was situated, on the vague chance of passing little Florence in\r\nthe street. But the sentiment of all this was as boyish and innocent as\r\ncould be. Florence was very pretty, and it is pleasant to admire a\r\npretty face. Florence was defenceless and weak, and it was a proud\r\nthought that he had been able to render her any protection and\r\nassistance. Florence was the most grateful little creature in the\r\nworld, and it was delightful to see her bright gratitude beaming in her\r\nface. Florence was neglected and coldly looked upon, and his breast was\r\nfull of youthful interest for the slighted child in her dull, stately\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that, perhaps some half-a-dozen times in the course\r\nof the year, Walter pulled off his hat to Florence in the street, and\r\nFlorence would stop to shake hands. Mrs Wickam (who, with a\r\ncharacteristic alteration of his name, invariably spoke of him as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Graves\xe2\x80\x9d) was so well used to this, knowing the story of their\r\nacquaintance, that she took no heed of it at all. Miss Nipper, on the\r\nother hand, rather looked out for these occasions: her sensitive young\r\nheart being secretly propitiated by Walter\xe2\x80\x99s good looks, and inclining\r\nto the belief that its sentiments were responded to.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Walter, so far from forgetting or losing sight of his\r\nacquaintance with Florence, only remembered it better and better. As to\r\nits adventurous beginning, and all those little circumstances which\r\ngave it a distinctive character and relish, he took them into account,\r\nmore as a pleasant story very agreeable to his imagination, and not to\r\nbe dismissed from it, than as a part of any matter of fact with which\r\nhe was concerned. They set off Florence very much, to his fancy; but\r\nnot himself. Sometimes he thought (and then he walked very fast) what a\r\ngrand thing it would have been for him to have been going to sea on the\r\nday after that first meeting, and to have gone, and to have done\r\nwonders there, and to have stopped away a long time, and to have come\r\nback an Admiral of all the colours of the dolphin, or at least a\r\nPost-Captain with epaulettes of insupportable brightness, and have\r\nmarried Florence (then a beautiful young woman) in spite of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteeth, cravat, and watch-chain, and borne her away to the blue shores\r\nof somewhere or other, triumphantly. But these flights of fancy seldom\r\nburnished the brass plate of Dombey and Son\xe2\x80\x99s Offices into a tablet of\r\ngolden hope, or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights; and\r\nwhen the Captain and Uncle Sol talked about Richard Whittington and\r\nmasters\xe2\x80\x99 daughters, Walter felt that he understood his true position at\r\nDombey and Son\xe2\x80\x99s, much better than they did.\r\n\r\nSo it was that he went on doing what he had to do from day to day, in a\r\ncheerful, pains-taking, merry spirit; and saw through the sanguine\r\ncomplexion of Uncle Sol and Captain Cuttle; and yet entertained a\r\nthousand indistinct and visionary fancies of his own, to which theirs\r\nwere work-a-day probabilities. Such was his condition at the Pipchin\r\nperiod, when he looked a little older than of yore, but not much; and\r\nwas the same light-footed, light-hearted, light-headed lad, as when he\r\ncharged into the parlour at the head of Uncle Sol and the imaginary\r\nboarders, and lighted him to bring up the Madeira.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re well. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten\r\nany breakfast. I shall bring a doctor to you, if you go on like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t give me what I want, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least he is\r\nin good practice if he can\xe2\x80\x94and then he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Uncle? Customers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Solomon, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cCustomers would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, putting down his breakfast cup with\r\na clatter, and striking his hand on the table: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I see the people\r\ngoing up and down the street in shoals all day, and passing and\r\nre-passing the shop every minute, by scores, I feel half tempted to\r\nrush out, collar somebody, bring him in, and make him buy fifty pounds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworth of instruments for ready money. What are you looking in at the\r\ndoor for?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d continued Walter, apostrophizing an old gentleman with a\r\npowdered head (inaudibly to him of course), who was staring at a ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntelescope with all his might and main. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no use. I could do that.\r\nCome in and buy it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman, however, having satiated his curiosity, walked\r\ncalmly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way with \xe2\x80\x99em all. But,\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x94I say, Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for the old man was meditating and had not\r\nresponded to his first appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be cast down. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be out of\r\nspirits, Uncle. When orders do come, they\xe2\x80\x99ll come in such a crowd, you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be able to execute \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be past executing \xe2\x80\x99em, whenever they come, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nSolomon Gills. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll never come to this shop again, till I am out of\r\nt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Uncle! You musn\xe2\x80\x99t really, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d urged Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol endeavoured to assume a cheery look, and smiled across the\r\nlittle table at him as pleasantly as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than usual the matter; is there, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWalter, leaning his elbows on the tea tray, and bending over, to speak\r\nthe more confidentially and kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cBe open with me, Uncle, if there\r\nis, and tell me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Old Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than usual? No, no. What should\r\nthere be the matter more than usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter answered with an incredulous shake of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nwant to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you ask me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Uncle,\r\nwhen I see you like this, I am quite sorry that I live with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol opened his eyes involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Though nobody ever was happier than I am and always have been\r\nwith you, I am quite sorry that I live with you, when I see you with\r\nanything in your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little dull at such times, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Solomon, meekly\r\nrubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean, Uncle Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Walter, bending over a little more to\r\npat him on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that then I feel you ought to have,\r\nsitting here and pouring out the tea instead of me, a nice little\r\ndumpling of a wife, you know,\xe2\x80\x94a comfortable, capital, cosy old lady,\r\nwho was just a match for you, and knew how to manage you, and keep you\r\nin good heart. Here am I, as loving a nephew as ever was (I am sure I\r\nought to be!) but I am only a nephew, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be such a companion\r\nto you when you\xe2\x80\x99re low and out of sorts as she would have made herself,\r\nyears ago, though I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d give any money if I could cheer you up.\r\nAnd so I say, when I see you with anything on your mind, that I feel\r\nquite sorry you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got somebody better about you than a blundering\r\nyoung rough-and-tough boy like me, who has got the will to console you,\r\nUncle, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the way\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the way,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Walter,\r\nreaching over further yet, to shake his Uncle by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWally, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon, \xe2\x80\x9cif the cosy little old lady had\r\ntaken her place in this parlour five and forty years ago, I never could\r\nhave been fonder of her than I am of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, Uncle Sol,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, I know\r\nthat. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had the whole weight of any uncomfortable\r\nsecrets if she had been with you, because she would have known how to\r\nrelieve you of \xe2\x80\x99em, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, you do,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Instrument-maker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Uncle Sol?\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, coaxingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon Gills persisted that there was nothing the matter; and\r\nmaintained it so resolutely, that his nephew had no resource but to\r\nmake a very indifferent imitation of believing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is, Uncle Sol, that if there is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more to say; and that\xe2\x80\x99s lucky,\r\nfor my time\xe2\x80\x99s up for going to business. I shall look in by-and-by when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m out, to see how you get on, Uncle. And mind, Uncle! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nbelieve you again, and never tell you anything more about Mr Carker the\r\nJunior, if I find out that you have been deceiving me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon Gills laughingly defied him to find out anything of the kind;\r\nand Walter, revolving in his thoughts all sorts of impracticable ways\r\nof making fortunes and placing the wooden Midshipman in a position of\r\nindependence, betook himself to the offices of Dombey and Son with a\r\nheavier countenance than he usually carried there.\r\n\r\nThere lived in those days, round the corner\xe2\x80\x94in Bishopsgate Street\r\nWithout\xe2\x80\x94one Brogley, sworn broker and appraiser, who kept a shop where\r\nevery description of second-hand furniture was exhibited in the most\r\nuncomfortable aspect, and under circumstances and in combinations the\r\nmost completely foreign to its purpose. Dozens of chairs hooked on to\r\nwashing-stands, which with difficulty poised themselves on the\r\nshoulders of sideboards, which in their turn stood upon the wrong side\r\nof dining-tables, gymnastic with their legs upward on the tops of other\r\ndining-tables, were among its most reasonable arrangements. A banquet\r\narray of dish-covers, wine-glasses, and decanters was generally to be\r\nseen, spread forth upon the bosom of a four-post bedstead, for the\r\nentertainment of such genial company as half-a-dozen pokers, and a hall\r\nlamp. A set of window curtains with no windows belonging to them, would\r\nbe seen gracefully draping a barricade of chests of drawers, loaded\r\nwith little jars from chemists\xe2\x80\x99 shops; while a homeless hearthrug\r\nsevered from its natural companion the fireside, braved the shrewd east\r\nwind in its adversity, and trembled in melancholy accord with the\r\nshrill complainings of a cabinet piano, wasting away, a string a day,\r\nand faintly resounding to the noises of the street in its jangling and\r\ndistracted brain. Of motionless clocks that never stirred a finger, and\r\nseemed as incapable of being successfully wound up, as the pecuniary\r\naffairs of their former owners, there was always great choice in Mr\r\nBrogley\xe2\x80\x99s shop; and various looking-glasses, accidentally placed at\r\ncompound interest of reflection and refraction, presented to the eye an\r\neternal perspective of bankruptcy and ruin.\r\n\r\nMr Brogley himself was a moist-eyed, pink-complexioned, crisp-haired\r\nman, of a bulky figure and an easy temper\xe2\x80\x94for that class of Caius\r\nMarius who sits upon the ruins of other people\xe2\x80\x99s Carthages, can keep up\r\nhis spirits well enough. He had looked in at Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s shop sometimes,\r\nto ask a question about articles in Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s way of business; and\r\nWalter knew him sufficiently to give him good day when they met in the\r\nstreet. But as that was the extent of the broker\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with\r\nSolomon Gills also, Walter was not a little surprised when he came back\r\nin the course of the forenoon, agreeably to his promise, to find Mr\r\nBrogley sitting in the back parlour with his hands in his pockets, and\r\nhis hat hanging up behind the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. The old man was sitting ruefully on the\r\nopposite side of the table, with his spectacles over his eyes, for a\r\nwonder, instead of on his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon shook his head, and waved one hand towards the broker, as\r\nintroducing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Walter, with a catching in his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter, said Mr Brogley. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let it put\r\nyou out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter looked from the broker to his Uncle in mute amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Brogley, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a little payment on a bond\r\ndebt \xe2\x80\x94three hundred and seventy odd, overdue: and I\xe2\x80\x99m in possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn possession!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, looking round at the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Brogley, in confidential assent, and nodding his head as\r\nif he would urge the advisability of their all being comfortable\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an execution. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it put you\r\nout of the way. I come myself, because of keeping it quiet and\r\nsociable. You know me. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWally, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the first time. Such a\r\ncalamity never happened to me before. I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d Pushing\r\nup his spectacles again (for they were useless any longer to conceal\r\nhis emotion), he covered his face with his hand, and sobbed aloud, and\r\nhis tears fell down upon his coffee-coloured waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sol! Pray! oh don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Walter, who really felt a thrill\r\nof terror in seeing the old man weep. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t do that. Mr\r\nBrogley, what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should recommend you looking up a friend or so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Brogley,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand talking it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, catching at anything. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! Thankee.\r\nCaptain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s the man, Uncle. Wait till I run to Captain Cuttle.\r\nKeep your eye upon my Uncle, will you, Mr Brogley, and make him as\r\ncomfortable as you can while I am gone? Don\xe2\x80\x99t despair, Uncle Sol. Try\r\nand keep a good heart, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying this with great fervour, and disregarding the old man\xe2\x80\x99s broken\r\nremonstrances, Walter dashed out of the shop again as hard as he could\r\ngo; and, having hurried round to the office to excuse himself on the\r\nplea of his Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s sudden illness, set off, full speed, for Captain\r\nCuttle\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed altered as he ran along the streets. There were the\r\nusual entanglement and noise of carts, drays, omnibuses, waggons, and\r\nfoot passengers, but the misfortune that had fallen on the wooden\r\nMidshipman made it strange and new. Houses and shops were different\r\nfrom what they used to be, and bore Mr Brogley\xe2\x80\x99s warrant on their\r\nfronts in large characters. The broker seemed to have got hold of the\r\nvery churches; for their spires rose into the sky with an unwonted air.\r\nEven the sky itself was changed, and had an execution in it plainly.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle lived on the brink of a little canal near the India\r\nDocks, where there was a swivel bridge which opened now and then to let\r\nsome wandering monster of a ship come roaming up the street like a\r\nstranded leviathan. The gradual change from land to water, on the\r\napproach to Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, was curious. It began with the\r\nerection of flagstaffs, as appurtenances to public-houses; then came\r\nslop-sellers\xe2\x80\x99 shops, with Guernsey shirts, sou\xe2\x80\x99wester hats, and canvas\r\npantaloons, at once the tightest and the loosest of their order,\r\nhanging up outside. These were succeeded by anchor and chain-cable\r\nforges, where sledgehammers were dinging upon iron all day long. Then\r\ncame rows of houses, with little vane-surmounted masts uprearing\r\nthemselves from among the scarlet beans. Then, ditches. Then, pollard\r\nwillows. Then, more ditches. Then, unaccountable patches of dirty\r\nwater, hardly to be descried, for the ships that covered them. Then,\r\nthe air was perfumed with chips; and all other trades were swallowed up\r\nin mast, oar, and block-making, and boatbuilding. Then, the ground grew\r\nmarshy and unsettled. Then, there was nothing to be smelt but rum and\r\nsugar. Then, Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings\xe2\x80\x94at once a first floor and a top\r\nstorey, in Brig Place\xe2\x80\x94were close before you.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was one of those timber-looking men, suits of oak as well\r\nas hearts, whom it is almost impossible for the liveliest imagination\r\nto separate from any part of their dress, however insignificant.\r\nAccordingly, when Walter knocked at the door, and the Captain instantly\r\npoked his head out of one of his little front windows, and hailed him,\r\nwith the hard glared hat already on it, and the shirt-collar like a\r\nsail, and the wide suit of blue, all standing as usual, Walter was as\r\nfully persuaded that he was always in that state, as if the Captain had\r\nbeen a bird and those had been his feathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle. \xe2\x80\x9cStand by and knock again. Hard!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s washing day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter, in his impatience, gave a prodigious thump with the knocker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, and immediately drew in his head, as\r\nif he expected a squall.\r\n\r\nNor was he mistaken: for a widow lady, with her sleeves rolled up to\r\nher shoulders, and her arms frothy with soap-suds and smoking with hot\r\nwater, replied to the summons with startling rapidity. Before she\r\nlooked at Walter she looked at the knocker, and then, measuring him\r\nwith her eyes from head to foot, said she wondered he had left any of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s at home, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter with a conciliatory\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the widow lady. \xe2\x80\x9cIn-deed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just been speaking to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, in breathless\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the widow lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThen p\xe2\x80\x99raps you\xe2\x80\x99ll give him Mrs\r\nMacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s respects, and say that the next time he lowers himself and\r\nhis lodgings by talking out of the winder she\xe2\x80\x99ll thank him to come down\r\nand open the door too.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs MacStinger spoke loud, and listened for any\r\nobservations that might be offered from the first floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the goodness to let me\r\nin, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor he was repelled by a wooden fortification extending across the\r\ndoorway, and put there to prevent the little MacStingers in their\r\nmoments of recreation from tumbling down the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy that can knock my door down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger,\r\ncontemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9ccan get over that, I should hope!\xe2\x80\x9d But Walter, taking\r\nthis as a permission to enter, and getting over it, Mrs MacStinger\r\nimmediately demanded whether an Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x99s house was her castle or\r\nnot; and whether she was to be broke in upon by \xe2\x80\x9craff.\xe2\x80\x9d On these\r\nsubjects her thirst for information was still very importunate, when\r\nWalter, having made his way up the little staircase through an\r\nartificial fog occasioned by the washing, which covered the banisters\r\nwith a clammy perspiration, entered Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s room, and found\r\nthat gentleman in ambush behind the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever owed her a penny, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, in a low voice,\r\nand with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cDone her a\r\nworld of good turns, and the children too. Vixen at times, though.\r\nWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should go away, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDursn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d find me out,\r\nwherever I went. Sit down. How\xe2\x80\x99s Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was dining (in his hat) off cold loin of mutton, porter,\r\nand some smoking hot potatoes, which he had cooked himself, and took\r\nout of a little saucepan before the fire as he wanted them. He\r\nunscrewed his hook at dinner-time, and screwed a knife into its wooden\r\nsocket instead, with which he had already begun to peel one of these\r\npotatoes for Walter. His rooms were very small, and strongly\r\nimpregnated with tobacco-smoke, but snug enough: everything being\r\nstowed away, as if there were an earthquake regularly every half-hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\nWalter, who had by this time recovered his breath, and lost his\r\nspirits\xe2\x80\x94or such temporary spirits as his rapid journey had given\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94looked at his questioner for a moment, said \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Captain Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand burst into tears.\r\n\r\nNo words can describe the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s consternation at this sight. Mrs\r\nMacStinger faded into nothing before it. He dropped the potato and the\r\nfork\xe2\x80\x94and would have dropped the knife too if he could\xe2\x80\x94and sat gazing at\r\nthe boy, as if he expected to hear next moment that a gulf had opened\r\nin the City, which had swallowed up his old friend, coffee-coloured\r\nsuit, buttons, chronometer, spectacles, and all.\r\n\r\nBut when Walter told him what was really the matter, Captain Cuttle,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, started up into full activity. He emptied\r\nout of a little tin canister on the top shelf of the cupboard, his\r\nwhole stock of ready money (amounting to thirteen pounds and\r\nhalf-a-crown), which he transferred to one of the pockets of his square\r\nblue coat; further enriched that repository with the contents of his\r\nplate chest, consisting of two withered atomies of tea-spoons, and an\r\nobsolete pair of knock-knee\xe2\x80\x99d sugar-tongs; pulled up his immense\r\ndouble-cased silver watch from the depths in which it reposed, to\r\nassure himself that that valuable was sound and whole; re-attached the\r\nhook to his right wrist; and seizing the stick covered over with knobs,\r\nbade Walter come along.\r\n\r\nRemembering, however, in the midst of his virtuous excitement, that Mrs\r\nMacStinger might be lying in wait below, Captain Cuttle hesitated at\r\nlast, not without glancing at the window, as if he had some thoughts of\r\nescaping by that unusual means of egress, rather than encounter his\r\nterrible enemy. He decided, however, in favour of stratagem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, with a timid wink, \xe2\x80\x9cgo afore, my lad. Sing\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98good-bye, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x99 when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the passage, and shut\r\nthe door. Then wait at the corner of the street \xe2\x80\x9ctill you see me.\r\n\r\nThese directions were not issued without a previous knowledge of the\r\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s tactics, for when Walter got downstairs, Mrs MacStinger glided\r\nout of the little back kitchen, like an avenging spirit. But not\r\ngliding out upon the Captain, as she had expected, she merely made a\r\nfurther allusion to the knocker, and glided in again.\r\n\r\nSome five minutes elapsed before Captain Cuttle could summon courage to\r\nattempt his escape; for Walter waited so long at the street corner,\r\nlooking back at the house, before there were any symptoms of the hard\r\nglazed hat. At length the Captain burst out of the door with the\r\nsuddenness of an explosion, and coming towards him at a great pace, and\r\nnever once looking over his shoulder, pretended, as soon as they were\r\nwell out of the street, to whistle a tune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle much hove down, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain, as they were\r\nwalking along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid so. If you had seen him this morning, you would never have\r\nforgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk fast, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, mending his pace;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand walk the same all the days of your life. Overhaul the catechism\r\nfor that advice, and keep it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was too busy with his own thoughts of Solomon Gills,\r\nmingled perhaps with some reflections on his late escape from Mrs\r\nMacStinger, to offer any further quotations on the way for Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoral improvement They interchanged no other word until they arrived at\r\nold Sol\xe2\x80\x99s door, where the unfortunate wooden Midshipman, with his\r\ninstrument at his eye, seemed to be surveying the whole horizon in\r\nsearch of some friend to help him out of his difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGills!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, hurrying into the back parlour, and taking\r\nhim by the hand quite tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cLay your head well to the wind, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll fight through it. All you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, with\r\nthe solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most\r\nprecious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom, \xe2\x80\x9cis to lay\r\nyour head well to the wind, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll fight through it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol returned the pressure of his hand, and thanked him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, then, with a gravity suitable to the nature of the\r\noccasion, put down upon the table the two tea-spoons and the\r\nsugar-tongs, the silver watch, and the ready money; and asked Mr\r\nBrogley, the broker, what the damage was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! What do you make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lord help you!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the broker; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that\r\nproperty\xe2\x80\x99s of any use, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? The amount\xe2\x80\x99s three hundred and seventy, odd,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the broker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, though he was evidently dismayed by\r\nthe figures: \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x99s fish that comes to your net, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Brogley. \xe2\x80\x9cBut sprats ain\xe2\x80\x99t whales, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this observation seemed to strike the Captain. He\r\nruminated for a minute; eyeing the broker, meanwhile, as a deep genius;\r\nand then called the Instrument-maker aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the bearings of this business?\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s the creditor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome away. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak before Wally.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of security for Wally\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x94an old bond. I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid a\r\ngood deal of it, Ned, but the times are so bad with me that I can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nmore just now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve foreseen it, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Not a word\r\nbefore Wally, for all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got some money, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Captain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94oh yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some,\xe2\x80\x9d returned old Sol, first putting his\r\nhands into his empty pockets, and then squeezing his Welsh wig between\r\nthem, as if he thought he might wring some gold out of it; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlittle I have got, isn\xe2\x80\x99t convertible, Ned; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be got at. I have\r\nbeen trying to do something with it for Wally, and I\xe2\x80\x99m old fashioned,\r\nand behind the time. It\xe2\x80\x99s here and there, and\xe2\x80\x94and, in short, it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\ngood as nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, looking in bewilderment about him.\r\n\r\nHe had so much the air of a half-witted person who had been hiding his\r\nmoney in a variety of places, and had forgotten where, that the Captain\r\nfollowed his eyes, not without a faint hope that he might remember some\r\nfew hundred pounds concealed up the chimney, or down in the cellar. But\r\nSolomon Gills knew better than that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m behind the time altogether, my dear Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sol, in resigned\r\ndespair, \xe2\x80\x9ca long way. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use my lagging on so far behind it. The\r\nstock had better be sold\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s worth more than this debt\xe2\x80\x94and I had\r\nbetter go and die somewhere, on the balance. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any energy left.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand things. This had better be the end of it. Let \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nsell the stock and take him down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, pointing feebly to\r\nthe wooden Midshipman, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us both be broken up together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean to do with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\r\nSit ye down, Gills, sit ye down, and let me think o\xe2\x80\x99 this. If I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na man on a small annuity, that was large enough till today, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nneed to think of it. But you only lay your head well to the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Captain, again administering that unanswerable piece of\r\nconsolation, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99re all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol thanked him from his heart, and went and laid it against the\r\nback parlour fire-place instead.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle walked up and down the shop for some time, cogitating\r\nprofoundly, and bringing his bushy black eyebrows to bear so heavily on\r\nhis nose, like clouds setting on a mountain, that Walter was afraid to\r\noffer any interruption to the current of his reflections. Mr Brogley,\r\nwho was averse to being any constraint upon the party, and who had an\r\ningenious cast of mind, went, softly whistling, among the stock;\r\nrattling weather-glasses, shaking compasses as if they were physic,\r\ncatching up keys with loadstones, looking through telescopes,\r\nendeavouring to make himself acquainted with the use of the globes,\r\nsetting parallel rulers astride on to his nose, and amusing himself\r\nwith other philosophical transactions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, with great animation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe stock\xe2\x80\x99s the security.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m another. Your governor\xe2\x80\x99s the man to advance money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Walter.\r\n\r\nThe Captain nodded gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at Gills. If\r\nthey was to sell off these things now, he\xe2\x80\x99d die of it. You know he\r\nwould. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a stone unturned\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s a stone for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stone!\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou run round to the office, first of all, and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Captain Cuttle, clapping him on the back. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter felt he must not dispute the command\xe2\x80\x94a glance at his Uncle would\r\nhave determined him if he had felt otherwise\xe2\x80\x94and disappeared to execute\r\nit. He soon returned, out of breath, to say that Mr Dombey was not\r\nthere. It was Saturday, and he had gone to Brighton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, who seemed to have prepared\r\nhimself for this contingency in his absence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Brighton.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll back you, my boy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll back you, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Brighton by\r\nthe afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the application must be made to Mr Dombey at all, which was awful to\r\nthink of, Walter felt that he would rather prefer it alone and\r\nunassisted, than backed by the personal influence of Captain Cuttle, to\r\nwhich he hardly thought Mr Dombey would attach much weight. But as the\r\nCaptain appeared to be of quite another opinion, and was bent upon it,\r\nand as his friendship was too zealous and serious to be trifled with by\r\none so much younger than himself, he forbore to hint the least\r\nobjection. Cuttle, therefore, taking a hurried leave of Solomon Gills,\r\nand returning the ready money, the teaspoons, the sugar-tongs, and the\r\nsilver watch, to his pocket\xe2\x80\x94with a view, as Walter thought, with\r\nhorror, to making a gorgeous impression on Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94bore him off to\r\nthe coach-office, without a minute\xe2\x80\x99s delay, and repeatedly assured him,\r\non the road, that he would stick by him to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nContaining the Sequel of the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s Disaster\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Bagstock, after long and frequent observation of Paul, across\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, through his double-barrelled opera-glass; and after\r\nreceiving many minute reports, daily, weekly, and monthly, on that\r\nsubject, from the native who kept himself in constant communication\r\nwith Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s maid for that purpose; came to the conclusion that\r\nDombey, Sir, was a man to be known, and that J. B. was the boy to make\r\nhis acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, however, maintaining her reserved behaviour, and frigidly\r\ndeclining to understand the Major whenever he called (which he often\r\ndid) on any little fishing excursion connected with this project, the\r\nMajor, in spite of his constitutional toughness and slyness, was fain\r\nto leave the accomplishment of his desire in some measure to chance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club, \xe2\x80\x9chas been\r\nfifty to one in favour of Joey B., Sir, ever since his elder brother\r\ndied of Yellow Jack in the West Indies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was some time coming to his aid in the present instance, but it\r\nbefriended him at last. When the dark servant, with full particulars,\r\nreported Miss Tox absent on Brighton service, the Major was suddenly\r\ntouched with affectionate reminiscences of his friend Bill Bitherstone\r\nof Bengal, who had written to ask him, if he ever went that way, to\r\nbestow a call upon his only son. But when the same dark servant\r\nreported Paul at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s, and the Major, referring to the letter\r\nfavoured by Master Bitherstone on his arrival in England\xe2\x80\x94to which he\r\nhad never had the least idea of paying any attention\xe2\x80\x94saw the opening\r\nthat presented itself, he was made so rabid by the gout, with which he\r\nhappened to be then laid up, that he threw a footstool at the dark\r\nservant in return for his intelligence, and swore he would be the death\r\nof the rascal before he had done with him: which the dark servant was\r\nmore than half disposed to believe.\r\n\r\nAt length the Major being released from his fit, went one Saturday\r\ngrowling down to Brighton, with the native behind him; apostrophizing\r\nMiss Tox all the way, and gloating over the prospect of carrying by\r\nstorm the distinguished friend to whom she attached so much mystery,\r\nand for whom she had deserted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, would you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, straining with\r\nvindictiveness, and swelling every already swollen vein in his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give Joey B. the go-by, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Not yet, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, not yet!\r\nDamme, not yet, Sir. Joe is awake, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Bagstock is alive, Sir. J. B.\r\nknows a move or two, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Josh has his weather-eye open, Sir. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind him tough, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Tough, Sir, tough is Joseph. Tough, and\r\nde-vilish sly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd very tough indeed Master Bitherstone found him, when he took that\r\nyoung gentleman out for a walk. But the Major, with his complexion like\r\na Stilton cheese, and his eyes like a prawn\xe2\x80\x99s, went roving about,\r\nperfectly indifferent to Master Bitherstone\xe2\x80\x99s amusement, and dragging\r\nMaster Bitherstone along, while he looked about him high and low, for\r\nMr Dombey and his children.\r\n\r\nIn good time the Major, previously instructed by Mrs Pipchin, spied out\r\nPaul and Florence, and bore down upon them; there being a stately\r\ngentleman (Mr Dombey, doubtless) in their company. Charging with Master\r\nBitherstone into the very heart of the little squadron, it fell out, of\r\ncourse, that Master Bitherstone spoke to his fellow-sufferers. Upon\r\nthat the Major stopped to notice and admire them; remembered with\r\namazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place; opined that Paul was a devilish fine fellow, and\r\nhis own little friend; inquired if he remembered Joey B. the Major; and\r\nfinally, with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life,\r\nturned and apologised to Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my little friend here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a boy of me\r\nagain: An old soldier, Sir\xe2\x80\x94Major Bagstock, at your service\xe2\x80\x94is not\r\nashamed to confess it.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the Major lifted his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the Major with sudden warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cI envy you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he recollected\r\nhimself, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey begged he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old campaigner, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9ca smoke-dried, sun-burnt,\r\nused-up, invalided old dog of a Major, Sir, was not afraid of being\r\ncondemned for his whim by a man like Mr Dombey. I have the honour of\r\naddressing Mr Dombey, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the present unworthy representative of that name, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G\xe2\x80\x94, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a great name. It\xe2\x80\x99s a name, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Major firmly, as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him, and\r\nwould feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is known\r\nand honoured in the British possessions abroad. It is a name, Sir, that\r\na man is proud to recognise. There is nothing adulatory in Joseph\r\nBagstock, Sir. His Royal Highness the Duke of York observed on more\r\nthan one occasion, \xe2\x80\x98there is no adulation in Joey. He is a plain old\r\nsoldier is Joe. He is tough to a fault is Joseph:\xe2\x80\x99 but it\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nname, Sir. By the Lord, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great name!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good enough to rate it higher than it deserves, perhaps,\r\nMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, in a severe tone. No, Mr Dombey, let us\r\nunderstand each other. That is not the Bagstock vein, Sir. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow Joseph B. He is a blunt old blade is Josh. No flattery in him,\r\nSir. Nothing like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey inclined his head, and said he believed him to be in earnest,\r\nand that his high opinion was gratifying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little friend here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the Major, looking as amiably as\r\nhe could, on Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cwill certify for Joseph Bagstock that he is a\r\nthorough-going, down-right, plain-spoken, old Trump, Sir, and nothing\r\nmore. That boy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major in a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwill live in\r\nhistory. That boy, Sir, is not a common production. Take care of him,\r\nMr Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey seemed to intimate that he would endeavour to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a boy here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Major, confidentially, and\r\ngiving him a thrust with his cane. \xe2\x80\x9cSon of Bitherstone of Bengal. Bill\r\nBitherstone formerly of ours. That boy\xe2\x80\x99s father and myself, Sir, were\r\nsworn friends. Wherever you went, Sir, you heard of nothing but Bill\r\nBitherstone and Joe Bagstock. Am I blind to that boy\xe2\x80\x99s defects? By no\r\nmeans. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fool, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey glanced at the libelled Master Bitherstone, of whom he knew\r\nat least as much as the Major did, and said, in quite a complacent\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what he is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a fool. Joe Bagstock\r\nnever minces matters. The son of my old friend Bill Bitherstone, of\r\nBengal, is a born fool, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the Major laughed till he was almost\r\nblack. \xe2\x80\x9cMy little friend is destined for a public school, I presume, Mr\r\nDombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major when he had recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite decided,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cI think not. He is\r\ndelicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s delicate, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right. None but the\r\ntough fellows could live through it, Sir, at Sandhurst. We put each\r\nother to the torture there, Sir. We roasted the new fellows at a slow\r\nfire, and hung \xe2\x80\x99em out of a three pair of stairs window, with their\r\nheads downwards. Joseph Bagstock, Sir, was held out of the window by\r\nthe heels of his boots, for thirteen minutes by the college clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major might have appealed to his countenance in corroboration of\r\nthis story. It certainly looked as if he had hung out a little too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it made us what we were, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, settling his shirt\r\nfrill. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were iron, Sir, and it forged us. Are you remaining here, Mr\r\nDombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI generally come down once a week, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d returned that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstay at the Bedford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the honour of calling at the Bedford, Sir, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npermit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cJoey B., Sir, is not in general a calling\r\nman, but Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s is not a common name. I am much indebted to my\r\nlittle friend, Sir, for the honour of this introduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey made a very gracious reply; and Major Bagstock, having patted\r\nPaul on the head, and said of Florence that her eyes would play the\r\nDevil with the youngsters before long\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand the oldsters too, Sir, if\r\nyou come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Major, chuckling very much\xe2\x80\x94stirred up\r\nMaster Bitherstone with his walking-stick, and departed with that young\r\ngentleman, at a kind of half-trot; rolling his head and coughing with\r\ngreat dignity, as he staggered away, with his legs very wide asunder.\r\n\r\nIn fulfilment of his promise, the Major afterwards called on Mr Dombey;\r\nand Mr Dombey, having referred to the army list, afterwards called on\r\nthe Major. Then the Major called at Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house in town; and came\r\ndown again, in the same coach as Mr Dombey. In short, Mr Dombey and the\r\nMajor got on uncommonly well together, and uncommonly fast: and Mr\r\nDombey observed of the Major, to his sister, that besides being quite a\r\nmilitary man he was really something more, as he had a very admirable\r\nidea of the importance of things unconnected with his own profession.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr Dombey, bringing down Miss Tox and Mrs Chick to see the\r\nchildren, and finding the Major again at Brighton, invited him to\r\ndinner at the Bedford, and complimented Miss Tox highly, beforehand, on\r\nher neighbour and acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox to Mrs Chick, when they were alone\r\ntogether, on the morning of the appointed day, \xe2\x80\x9cif I should seem at all\r\nreserved to Major Bagstock, or under any constraint with him, promise\r\nme not to notice it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Lucretia,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat mystery is involved in\r\nthis remarkable request? I must insist upon knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you are resolved to extort a confession from me, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Tox instantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no alternative but to confide to you that\r\nthe Major has been particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticular!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Major has long been very particular indeed, my love, in his\r\nattentions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9coccasionally they have been so very\r\nmarked, that my position has been one of no common difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in good circumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have every reason to believe, my dear\xe2\x80\x94indeed I may say I know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is wealthy. He is truly military, and full\r\nof anecdote. I have been informed that his valour, when he was in\r\nactive service, knew no bounds. I am told that he did all sorts of\r\nthings in the Peninsula, with every description of fire-arm; and in the\r\nEast and West Indies, my love, I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake to say what\r\nhe did not do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery creditable to him indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cextremely so; and you\r\nhave given him no encouragement, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to say, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Tox, with every demonstration\r\nof making an effort that rent her soul, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I never encouraged Major\r\nBagstock slightly, I should not do justice to the friendship which\r\nexists between you and me. It is, perhaps, hardly in the nature of\r\nwoman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself\r\nwithout betraying some sense of obligation. But that is past\xe2\x80\x94long past.\r\nBetween the Major and me there is now a yawning chasm, and I will not\r\nfeign to give encouragement, Louisa, where I cannot give my heart. My\r\naffections,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut, Louisa, this is madness!\xe2\x80\x9d and departed\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nAll this Mrs Chick communicated to her brother before dinner: and it by\r\nno means indisposed Mr Dombey to receive the Major with unwonted\r\ncordiality. The Major, for his part, was in a state of plethoric\r\nsatisfaction that knew no bounds: and he coughed, and choked, and\r\nchuckled, and gasped, and swelled, until the waiters seemed positively\r\nafraid of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour family monopolises Joe\xe2\x80\x99s light, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, when he had\r\nsaluted Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe lives in darkness. Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place is changed\r\ninto Kamschatka in the winter time. There is no ray of sun, Sir, for\r\nJoey B., now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox is good enough to take a great deal of interest in Paul,\r\nMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey on behalf of that blushing virgin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of my little friend. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npining away Sir. The Bagstock breed is degenerating in the forsaken\r\nperson of old Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Major, becoming bluer and bluer and puffing\r\nhis cheeks further and further over the stiff ridge of his tight\r\ncravat, stared at Miss Tox, until his eyes seemed as if he were at that\r\nmoment being overdone before the slow fire at the military college.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the palpitation of the heart which these allusions\r\noccasioned her, they were anything but disagreeable to Miss Tox, as\r\nthey enabled her to be extremely interesting, and to manifest an\r\noccasional incoherence and distraction which she was not at all\r\nunwilling to display. The Major gave her abundant opportunities of\r\nexhibiting this emotion: being profuse in his complaints, at dinner, of\r\nher desertion of him and Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place: and as he appeared to derive\r\ngreat enjoyment from making them, they all got on very well.\r\n\r\nNone the worse on account of the Major taking charge of the whole\r\nconversation, and showing as great an appetite in that respect as in\r\nregard of the various dainties on the table, among which he may be\r\nalmost said to have wallowed: greatly to the aggravation of his\r\ninflammatory tendencies. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s habitual silence and reserve\r\nyielding readily to this usurpation, the Major felt that he was coming\r\nout and shining: and in the flow of spirits thus engendered, rang such\r\nan infinite number of new changes on his own name that he quite\r\nastonished himself. In a word, they were all very well pleased. The\r\nMajor was considered to possess an inexhaustible fund of conversation;\r\nand when he took a late farewell, after a long rubber, Mr Dombey again\r\ncomplimented the blushing Miss Tox on her neighbour and acquaintance.\r\n\r\nBut all the way home to his own hotel, the Major incessantly said to\r\nhimself, and of himself, \xe2\x80\x9cSly, Sir\xe2\x80\x94sly, Sir\xe2\x80\x94de-vil-ish sly!\xe2\x80\x9d And when\r\nhe got there, sat down in a chair, and fell into a silent fit of\r\nlaughter, with which he was sometimes seized, and which was always\r\nparticularly awful. It held him so long on this occasion that the dark\r\nservant, who stood watching him at a distance, but dared not for his\r\nlife approach, twice or thrice gave him over for lost. His whole form,\r\nbut especially his face and head, dilated beyond all former experience;\r\nand presented to the dark man\xe2\x80\x99s view, nothing but a heaving mass of\r\nindigo. At length he burst into a violent paroxysm of coughing, and\r\nwhen that was a little better burst into such ejaculations as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, would you? Mrs Dombey, eh, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am? I think not,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am. Not while Joe B. can put a spoke in your wheel, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. J. B.\xe2\x80\x9cs\r\neven with you now, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether bowled out, yet, Sir,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t Bagstock. She\xe2\x80\x99s deep, Sir, deep, but Josh is deeper. Wide awake\r\nis old Joe\xe2\x80\x94broad awake, and staring, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d There was no doubt of this\r\nlast assertion being true, and to a very fearful extent; as it\r\ncontinued to be during the greater part of that night, which the Major\r\nchiefly passed in similar exclamations, diversified with fits of\r\ncoughing and choking that startled the whole house.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day after this occasion (being Sunday) when, as Mr\r\nDombey, Mrs Chick, and Miss Tox were sitting at breakfast, still\r\neulogising the Major, Florence came running in: her face suffused with\r\na bright colour, and her eyes sparkling joyfully: and cried,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Papa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Walter! and he won\xe2\x80\x99t come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she mean? What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence timidly; sensible of having approached\r\nthe presence with too much familiarity. \xe2\x80\x9cWho found me when I was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she mean young Gay, Louisa?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Dombey, knitting his\r\nbrows. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, this child\xe2\x80\x99s manners have become very boisterous. She\r\ncannot mean young Gay, I think. See what it is, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick hurried into the passage, and returned with the information\r\nthat it was young Gay, accompanied by a very strange-looking person;\r\nand that young Gay said he would not take the liberty of coming in,\r\nhearing Mr Dombey was at breakfast, but would wait until Mr Dombey\r\nshould signify that he might approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the boy to come in now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Gay, what is the\r\nmatter? Who sent you down here? Was there nobody else to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been sent. I\r\nhave been so bold as to come on my own account, which I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npardon when I mention the cause.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Dombey, without attending to what he said, was looking\r\nimpatiently on either side of him (as if he were a pillar in his way)\r\nat some object behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that? I think you have made some\r\nmistake in the door, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry to intrude with anyone, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter,\r\nhastily: \xe2\x80\x9cbut this is\xe2\x80\x94this is Captain Cuttle, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain in a deep voice: \xe2\x80\x9cstand by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Captain, coming a little further in, brought out\r\nhis wide suit of blue, his conspicuous shirt-collar, and his knobby\r\nnose in full relief, and stood bowing to Mr Dombey, and waving his hook\r\npolitely to the ladies, with the hard glazed hat in his one hand, and a\r\nred equator round his head which it had newly imprinted there.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey regarded this phenomenon with amazement and indignation, and\r\nseemed by his looks to appeal to Mrs Chick and Miss Tox against it.\r\nLittle Paul, who had come in after Florence, backed towards Miss Tox as\r\nthe Captain waved his hook, and stood on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Gay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Captain observed, as a general opening of the conversation\r\nthat could not fail to propitiate all parties, \xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, standby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d began Walter, trembling, and looking down at the\r\nground, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I take a very great liberty in coming\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I am sure I\r\ndo. I should hardly have had the courage to ask to see you, Sir, even\r\nafter coming down, I am afraid, if I had not overtaken Miss Dombey,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, following his eyes as he glanced at the\r\nattentive Florence, and frowning unconsciously as she encouraged him\r\nwith a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain, considering it incumbent on him, as a\r\npoint of good breeding, to support Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWell said! Go on,\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle ought to have been withered by the look which Mr Dombey\r\nbestowed upon him in acknowledgment of his patronage. But quite\r\ninnocent of this, he closed one eye in reply, and gave Mr Dombey to\r\nunderstand, by certain significant motions of his hook, that Walter was\r\na little bashful at first, and might be expected to come out shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is entirely a private and personal matter, that has brought me\r\nhere, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Walter, faltering, \xe2\x80\x9cand Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Captain, as an assurance that he was at hand,\r\nand might be relied upon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is a very old friend of my poor Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, and a most excellent man,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Walter, raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, \xe2\x80\x9cwas so good as to offer to come with me, which I\r\ncould hardly refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no;\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain complacently. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. No\r\ncall for refusing. Go on, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, venturing to meet Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s eye,\r\nand proceeding with better courage in the very desperation of the case,\r\nnow that there was no avoiding it, \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore I have come, with him,\r\nSir, to say that my poor old Uncle is in very great affliction and\r\ndistress. That, through the gradual loss of his business, and not being\r\nable to make a payment, the apprehension of which has weighed very\r\nheavily upon his mind, months and months, as indeed I know, Sir, he has\r\nan execution in his house, and is in danger of losing all he has, and\r\nbreaking his heart. And that if you would, in your kindness, and in\r\nyour old knowledge of him as a respectable man, do anything to help him\r\nout of his difficulty, Sir, we never could thank you enough for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes filled with tears as he spoke; and so did those of\r\nFlorence. Her father saw them glistening, though he appeared to look at\r\nWalter only.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very large sum, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than three hundred\r\npounds. My Uncle is quite beaten down by his misfortune, it lies so\r\nheavy on him; and is quite unable to do anything for his own relief. He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know yet, that I have come to speak to you. You would wish\r\nme to say, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added Walter, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cexactly\r\nwhat it is I want. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Sir. There is my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s stock,\r\non which I believe I may say, confidently, there are no other demands,\r\nand there is Captain Cuttle, who would wish to be security too. I\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhardly like to mention,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9csuch earnings as mine; but if\r\nyou would allow them\xe2\x80\x94accumulate\xe2\x80\x94payment\xe2\x80\x94advance\xe2\x80\x94Uncle\xe2\x80\x94frugal,\r\nhonourable, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d Walter trailed off, through these broken\r\nsentences, into silence: and stood with downcast head, before his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nConsidering this a favourable moment for the display of the valuables,\r\nCaptain Cuttle advanced to the table; and clearing a space among the\r\nbreakfast-cups at Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, produced the silver watch, the\r\nready money, the teaspoons, and the sugar-tongs; and piling them up\r\ninto a heap that they might look as precious as possible, delivered\r\nhimself of these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a loaf\xe2\x80\x99s better than no bread, and the same remark holds good\r\nwith crumbs. There\xe2\x80\x99s a few. Annuity of one hundred pound premium also\r\nready to be made over. If there is a man chock full of science in the\r\nworld, it\xe2\x80\x99s old Sol Gills. If there is a lad of promise\xe2\x80\x94one flowing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the Captain, in one of his happy quotations, \xe2\x80\x9cwith milk and\r\nhoney\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s his nevy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain then withdrew to his former place, where he stood arranging\r\nhis scattered locks with the air of a man who had given the finishing\r\ntouch to a difficult performance.\r\n\r\nWhen Walter ceased to speak, Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were attracted to little\r\nPaul, who, seeing his sister hanging down her head and silently weeping\r\nin her commiseration for the distress she had heard described, went\r\nover to her, and tried to comfort her: looking at Walter and his father\r\nas he did so, with a very expressive face. After the momentary\r\ndistraction of Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s address, which he regarded with lofty\r\nindifference, Mr Dombey again turned his eyes upon his son, and sat\r\nsteadily regarding the child, for some moments, in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was this debt contracted for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey, at length. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis the creditor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, putting his hand on Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI do. It came of helping a man that\xe2\x80\x99s dead now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncost my friend Gills many a hundred pound already. More particulars in\r\nprivate, if agreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who have enough to do to hold their own way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey,\r\nunobservant of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious signs behind Walter, and still\r\nlooking at his son, \xe2\x80\x9chad better be content with their own obligations\r\nand difficulties, and not increase them by engaging for other men. It\r\nis an act of dishonesty and presumption, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, sternly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgreat presumption; for the wealthy could do no more. Paul, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child obeyed: and Mr Dombey took him on his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had money now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul, whose eyes had wandered to his sister, and to Walter, looked his\r\nfather in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had money now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey; \xe2\x80\x9cas much money as young Gay has\r\ntalked about; what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to his old Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend it to his old Uncle, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! When you are\r\nold enough, you know, you will share my money, and we shall use it\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey and Son,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Paul, who had been tutored early in the\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey and Son,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated his father. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to begin to be\r\nDombey and Son, now, and lend this money to young Gay\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if you please, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul: \xe2\x80\x9cand so would Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9chave nothing to do with Dombey and Son. Would\r\nyou like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you shall do it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his father. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you see, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, dropping his voice, \xe2\x80\x9chow powerful money is, and how anxious\r\npeople are to get it. Young Gay comes all this way to beg for money,\r\nand you, who are so grand and great, having got it, are going to let\r\nhim have it, as a great favour and obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul turned up the old face for a moment, in which there was a sharp\r\nunderstanding of the reference conveyed in these words: but it was a\r\nyoung and childish face immediately afterwards, when he slipped down\r\nfrom his father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and ran to tell Florence not to cry any more,\r\nfor he was going to let young Gay have the money.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey then turned to a side-table, and wrote a note and sealed it.\r\nDuring the interval, Paul and Florence whispered to Walter, and Captain\r\nCuttle beamed on the three, with such aspiring and ineffably\r\npresumptuous thoughts as Mr Dombey never could have believed in. The\r\nnote being finished, Mr Dombey turned round to his former place, and\r\nheld it out to Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first thing to-morrow morning, to Mr Carker.\r\nHe will immediately take care that one of my people releases your Uncle\r\nfrom his present position, by paying the amount at issue; and that such\r\narrangements are made for its repayment as may be consistent with your\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances. You will consider that this is done for you by\r\nMaster Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter, in the emotion of holding in his hand the means of releasing\r\nhis good Uncle from his trouble, would have endeavoured to express\r\nsomething of his gratitude and joy. But Mr Dombey stopped him short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will consider that it is done,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cby Master Paul. I\r\nhave explained that to him, and he understands it. I wish no more to be\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he motioned towards the door, Walter could only bow his head and\r\nretire. Miss Tox, seeing that the Captain appeared about to do the\r\nsame, interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing Mr Dombey, at whose munificence\r\nboth she and Mrs Chick were shedding tears copiously; \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have\r\noverlooked something. Pardon me, Mr Dombey, I think, in the nobility of\r\nyour character, and its exalted scope, you have omitted a matter of\r\ndetail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Miss Tox!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman with the\xe2\x80\x94Instrument,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Miss Tox, glancing at\r\nCaptain Cuttle, \xe2\x80\x9chas left upon the table, at your elbow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, sweeping the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s property from\r\nhim, as if it were so much crumb indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cTake these things away. I am\r\nobliged to you, Miss Tox; it is like your usual discretion. Have the\r\ngoodness to take these things away, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle felt he had no alternative but to comply. But he was so\r\nmuch struck by the magnanimity of Mr Dombey, in refusing treasures\r\nlying heaped up to his hand, that when he had deposited the teaspoons\r\nand sugar-tongs in one pocket, and the ready money in another, and had\r\nlowered the great watch down slowly into its proper vault, he could not\r\nrefrain from seizing that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s right hand in his own solitary\r\nleft, and while he held it open with his powerful fingers, bringing the\r\nhook down upon its palm in a transport of admiration. At this touch of\r\nwarm feeling and cold iron, Mr Dombey shivered all over.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle then kissed his hook to the ladies several times, with\r\ngreat elegance and gallantry; and having taken a particular leave of\r\nPaul and Florence, accompanied Walter out of the room. Florence was\r\nrunning after them in the earnestness of her heart, to send some\r\nmessage to old Sol, when Mr Dombey called her back, and bade her stay\r\nwhere she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you never be a Dombey, my dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with\r\npathetic reproachfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. I am so thankful\r\nto Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have run and thrown her arms about his neck if she had dared;\r\nbut as she did not dare, she glanced with thankful eyes towards him, as\r\nhe sat musing; sometimes bestowing an uneasy glance on her, but, for\r\nthe most part, watching Paul, who walked about the room with the\r\nnew-blown dignity of having let young Gay have the money.\r\n\r\nAnd young Gay\xe2\x80\x94Walter\xe2\x80\x94what of him?\r\n\r\nHe was overjoyed to purge the old man\xe2\x80\x99s hearth from bailiffs and\r\nbrokers, and to hurry back to his Uncle with the good tidings. He was\r\noverjoyed to have it all arranged and settled next day before noon; and\r\nto sit down at evening in the little back parlour with old Sol and\r\nCaptain Cuttle; and to see the Instrument-maker already reviving, and\r\nhopeful for the future, and feeling that the wooden Midshipman was his\r\nown again. But without the least impeachment of his gratitude to Mr\r\nDombey, it must be confessed that Walter was humbled and cast down. It\r\nis when our budding hopes are nipped beyond recovery by some rough\r\nwind, that we are the most disposed to picture to ourselves what\r\nflowers they might have borne, if they had flourished; and now, when\r\nWalter found himself cut off from that great Dombey height, by the\r\ndepth of a new and terrible tumble, and felt that all his old wild\r\nfancies had been scattered to the winds in the fall, he began to\r\nsuspect that they might have led him on to harmless visions of aspiring\r\nto Florence in the remote distance of time.\r\n\r\nThe Captain viewed the subject in quite a different light. He appeared\r\nto entertain a belief that the interview at which he had assisted was\r\nso very satisfactory and encouraging, as to be only a step or two\r\nremoved from a regular betrothal of Florence to Walter; and that the\r\nlate transaction had immensely forwarded, if not thoroughly\r\nestablished, the Whittingtonian hopes. Stimulated by this conviction,\r\nand by the improvement in the spirits of his old friend, and by his own\r\nconsequent gaiety, he even attempted, in favouring them with the ballad\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cLovely Peg\xe2\x80\x9d for the third time in one evening, to make an\r\nextemporaneous substitution of the name \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence;\xe2\x80\x9d but finding this\r\ndifficult, on account of the word Peg invariably rhyming to leg (in\r\nwhich personal beauty the original was described as having excelled all\r\ncompetitors), he hit upon the happy thought of changing it to Fle-e-eg;\r\nwhich he accordingly did, with an archness almost supernatural, and a\r\nvoice quite vociferous, notwithstanding that the time was close at hand\r\nwhen he must seek the abode of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger.\r\n\r\nThat same evening the Major was diffuse at his club, on the subject of\r\nhis friend Dombey in the City. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nprince, is my friend Dombey in the City. I tell you what, Sir. If you\r\nhad a few more men among you like old Joe Bagstock and my friend Dombey\r\nin the City, Sir, you\xe2\x80\x99d do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Introduction to a New Scene\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s constitution was made of such hard metal, in spite of its\r\nliability to the fleshly weaknesses of standing in need of repose after\r\nchops, and of requiring to be coaxed to sleep by the soporific agency\r\nof sweet-breads, that it utterly set at naught the predictions of Mrs\r\nWickam, and showed no symptoms of decline. Yet, as Paul\xe2\x80\x99s rapt interest\r\nin the old lady continued unbated, Mrs Wickam would not budge an inch\r\nfrom the position she had taken up. Fortifying and entrenching herself\r\non the strong ground of her Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Betsey Jane, she advised Miss\r\nBerry, as a friend, to prepare herself for the worst; and forewarned\r\nher that her aunt might, at any time, be expected to go off suddenly,\r\nlike a powder-mill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Miss Berry,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Wickam would observe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll come into\r\nwhatever little property there may be to leave. You deserve it, I am\r\nsure, for yours is a trying life. Though there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem much worth\r\ncoming into\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my being so open\xe2\x80\x94in this dismal den.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Berry took it all in good part, and drudged and slaved away as\r\nusual; perfectly convinced that Mrs Pipchin was one of the most\r\nmeritorious persons in the world, and making every day innumerable\r\nsacrifices of herself upon the altar of that noble old woman. But all\r\nthese immolations of Berry were somehow carried to the credit of Mrs\r\nPipchin by Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s friends and admirers; and were made to\r\nharmonise with, and carry out, that melancholy fact of the deceased Mr\r\nPipchin having broken his heart in the Peruvian mines.\r\n\r\nFor example, there was an honest grocer and general dealer in the\r\nretail line of business, between whom and Mrs Pipchin there was a small\r\nmemorandum book, with a greasy red cover, perpetually in question, and\r\nconcerning which divers secret councils and conferences were\r\ncontinually being held between the parties to that register, on the mat\r\nin the passage, and with closed doors in the parlour. Nor were there\r\nwanting dark hints from Master Bitherstone (whose temper had been made\r\nrevengeful by the solar heats of India acting on his blood), of\r\nbalances unsettled, and of a failure, on one occasion within his\r\nmemory, in the supply of moist sugar at tea-time. This grocer being a\r\nbachelor and not a man who looked upon the surface for beauty, had once\r\nmade honourable offers for the hand of Berry, which Mrs Pipchin had,\r\nwith contumely and scorn, rejected. Everybody said how laudable this\r\nwas in Mrs Pipchin, relict of a man who had died of the Peruvian mines;\r\nand what a staunch, high, independent spirit the old lady had. But\r\nnobody said anything about poor Berry, who cried for six weeks (being\r\nsoundly rated by her good aunt all the time), and lapsed into a state\r\nof hopeless spinsterhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBerry\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of you, ain\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Paul once asked Mrs Pipchin when\r\nthey were sitting by the fire with the cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the disconcerted old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask such\r\nthings, Sir! why are you fond of your sister Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody like Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin, shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody like me, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t there really though?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul, leaning forward in his chair,\r\nand looking at her very hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Paul, rubbing his hands thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to ask him why, lest she should receive some\r\nperfectly annihilating answer. But as a compensation to her wounded\r\nfeelings, she harassed Master Bitherstone to that extent until\r\nbed-time, that he began that very night to make arrangements for an\r\noverland return to India, by secreting from his supper a quarter of a\r\nround of bread and a fragment of moist Dutch cheese, as the beginning\r\nof a stock of provision to support him on the voyage.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin had kept watch and ward over little Paul and his sister for\r\nnearly twelve months. They had been home twice, but only for a few\r\ndays; and had been constant in their weekly visits to Mr Dombey at the\r\nhotel. By little and little Paul had grown stronger, and had become\r\nable to dispense with his carriage; though he still looked thin and\r\ndelicate; and still remained the same old, quiet, dreamy child that he\r\nhad been when first consigned to Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s care. One Saturday\r\nafternoon, at dusk, great consternation was occasioned in the Castle by\r\nthe unlooked-for announcement of Mr Dombey as a visitor to Mrs Pipchin.\r\nThe population of the parlour was immediately swept upstairs as on the\r\nwings of a whirlwind, and after much slamming of bedroom doors, and\r\ntrampling overhead, and some knocking about of Master Bitherstone by\r\nMrs Pipchin, as a relief to the perturbation of her spirits, the black\r\nbombazeen garments of the worthy old lady darkened the audience-chamber\r\nwhere Mr Dombey was contemplating the vacant arm-chair of his son and\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cI am pretty well, considering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin always used that form of words. It meant, considering her\r\nvirtues, sacrifices, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t expect, Sir, to be very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, taking a\r\nchair and fetching her breath; \xe2\x80\x9cbut such health as I have, I am\r\ngrateful for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey inclined his head with the satisfied air of a patron, who\r\nfelt that this was the sort of thing for which he paid so much a\r\nquarter. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence he went on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin, I have taken the liberty of calling, to consult you in\r\nreference to my son. I have had it in my mind to do so for some time\r\npast; but have deferred it from time to time, in order that his health\r\nmight be thoroughly re-established. You have no misgivings on that\r\nsubject, Mrs Pipchin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrighton has proved very beneficial, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nbeneficial, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9chis remaining at Brighton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin rubbed her hands, and bent her grey eyes on the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, stretching out his forefinger, \xe2\x80\x9cbut possibly\r\nthat he should now make a change, and lead a different kind of life\r\nhere. In short, Mrs Pipchin, that is the object of my visit. My son is\r\ngetting on, Mrs Pipchin. Really, he is getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something melancholy in the triumphant air with which Mr\r\nDombey said this. It showed how long Paul\xe2\x80\x99s childish life had been to\r\nhim, and how his hopes were set upon a later stage of his existence.\r\nPity may appear a strange word to connect with anyone so haughty and so\r\ncold, and yet he seemed a worthy subject for it at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix years old!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, settling his neckcloth\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to hide\r\nan irrepressible smile that rather seemed to strike upon the surface of\r\nhis face and glance away, as finding no resting-place, than to play\r\nthere for an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, six will be changed to sixteen, before\r\nwe have time to look about us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the unsympathetic Pipchin, with a frosty\r\nglistening of her hard grey eye, and a dreary shaking of her bent head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on circumstances, returned Mr Dombey; \xe2\x80\x9cat all events, Mrs\r\nPipchin, my son is six years old, and there is no doubt, I fear, that\r\nin his studies he is behind many children of his age\xe2\x80\x94or his youth,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Dombey, quickly answering what he mistrusted was a shrewd\r\ntwinkle of the frosty eye, \xe2\x80\x9chis youth is a more appropriate expression.\r\nNow, Mrs Pipchin, instead of being behind his peers, my son ought to be\r\nbefore them; far before them. There is an eminence ready for him to\r\nmount upon. There is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my\r\nson. His way in life was clear and prepared, and marked out before he\r\nexisted. The education of such a young gentleman must not be delayed.\r\nIt must not be left imperfect. It must be very steadily and seriously\r\nundertaken, Mrs Pipchin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cI can say nothing to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was quite sure, Mrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, approvingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\na person of your good sense could not, and would not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of nonsense\xe2\x80\x94and worse\xe2\x80\x94talked about young people\r\nnot being pressed too hard at first, and being tempted on, and all the\r\nrest of it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, impatiently rubbing her hooked\r\nnose. \xe2\x80\x9cIt never was thought of in my time, and it has no business to be\r\nthought of now. My opinion is \xe2\x80\x98keep \xe2\x80\x99em at it\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good madam,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not acquired your\r\nreputation undeservedly; and I beg you to believe, Mrs Pipchin, that I\r\nam more than satisfied with your excellent system of management, and\r\nshall have the greatest pleasure in commending it whenever my poor\r\ncommendation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s loftiness when he affected to disparage his\r\nown importance, passed all bounds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan be of any service. I have been\r\nthinking of Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, Mrs Pipchin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy neighbour, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s is an\r\nexcellent establishment. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that it\xe2\x80\x99s very strictly conducted,\r\nand there is nothing but learning going on from morning to night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very expensive,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very expensive, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Pipchin, catching at the\r\nfact, as if in omitting that, she had omitted one of its leading\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had some communication with the Doctor, Mrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey, hitching his chair anxiously a little nearer to the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe does not consider Paul at all too young for his purpose. He\r\nmentioned several instances of boys in Greek at about the same age. If\r\nI have any little uneasiness in my own mind, Mrs Pipchin, on the\r\nsubject of this change, it is not on that head. My son not having known\r\na mother has gradually concentrated much\xe2\x80\x94too much\xe2\x80\x94of his childish\r\naffection on his sister. Whether their separation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey said no\r\nmore, but sat silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoity-toity!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Pipchin, shaking out her black bombazeen\r\nskirts, and plucking up all the ogress within her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit, Mr Dombey, she must be taught to lump it.\xe2\x80\x9d The good lady apologised\r\nimmediately afterwards for using so common a figure of speech, but said\r\n(and truly) that that was the way she reasoned with \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey waited until Mrs Pipchin had done bridling and shaking her\r\nhead, and frowning down a legion of Bitherstones and Pankeys; and then\r\nsaid quietly, but correctively, \xe2\x80\x9cHe, my good madam, he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s system would have applied very much the same mode of cure\r\nto any uneasiness on the part of Paul, too; but as the hard grey eye\r\nwas sharp enough to see that the recipe, however Mr Dombey might admit\r\nits efficacy in the case of the daughter, was not a sovereign remedy\r\nfor the son, she argued the point; and contended that change, and new\r\nsociety, and the different form of life he would lead at Doctor\r\nBlimber\xe2\x80\x99s, and the studies he would have to master, would very soon\r\nprove sufficient alienations. As this chimed in with Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhope and belief, it gave that gentleman a still higher opinion of Mrs\r\nPipchin\xe2\x80\x99s understanding; and as Mrs Pipchin, at the same time, bewailed\r\nthe loss of her dear little friend (which was not an overwhelming shock\r\nto her, as she had long expected it, and had not looked, in the\r\nbeginning, for his remaining with her longer than three months), he\r\nformed an equally good opinion of Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s disinterestedness. It\r\nwas plain that he had given the subject anxious consideration, for he\r\nhad formed a plan, which he announced to the ogress, of sending Paul to\r\nthe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s as a weekly boarder for the first half year, during which\r\ntime Florence would remain at the Castle, that she might receive her\r\nbrother there, on Saturdays. This would wean him by degrees, Mr Dombey\r\nsaid; possibly with a recollection of his not having been weaned by\r\ndegrees on a former occasion.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey finished the interview by expressing his hope that Mrs\r\nPipchin would still remain in office as general superintendent and\r\noverseer of his son, pending his studies at Brighton; and having kissed\r\nPaul, and shaken hands with Florence, and beheld Master Bitherstone in\r\nhis collar of state, and made Miss Pankey cry by patting her on the\r\nhead (in which region she was uncommonly tender, on account of a habit\r\nMrs Pipchin had of sounding it with her knuckles, like a cask), he\r\nwithdrew to his hotel and dinner: resolved that Paul, now that he was\r\ngetting so old and well, should begin a vigorous course of education\r\nforthwith, to qualify him for the position in which he was to shine;\r\nand that Doctor Blimber should take him in hand immediately.\r\n\r\nWhenever a young gentleman was taken in hand by Doctor Blimber, he\r\nmight consider himself sure of a pretty tight squeeze. The Doctor only\r\nundertook the charge of ten young gentlemen, but he had, always ready,\r\na supply of learning for a hundred, on the lowest estimate; and it was\r\nat once the business and delight of his life to gorge the unhappy ten\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s establishment was a great hot-house, in which\r\nthere was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work. All the boys blew\r\nbefore their time. Mental green-peas were produced at Christmas, and\r\nintellectual asparagus all the year round. Mathematical gooseberries\r\n(very sour ones too) were common at untimely seasons, and from mere\r\nsprouts of bushes, under Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s cultivation. Every\r\ndescription of Greek and Latin vegetable was got off the driest twigs\r\nof boys, under the frostiest circumstances. Nature was of no\r\nconsequence at all. No matter what a young gentleman was intended to\r\nbear, Doctor Blimber made him bear to pattern, somehow or other.\r\n\r\nThis was all very pleasant and ingenious, but the system of forcing was\r\nattended with its usual disadvantages. There was not the right taste\r\nabout the premature productions, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep well. Moreover,\r\none young gentleman, with a swollen nose and an excessively large head\r\n(the oldest of the ten who had \xe2\x80\x9cgone through\xe2\x80\x9d everything), suddenly\r\nleft off blowing one day, and remained in the establishment a mere\r\nstalk. And people did say that the Doctor had rather overdone it with\r\nyoung Toots, and that when he began to have whiskers he left off having\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nThere young Toots was, at any rate; possessed of the gruffest of voices\r\nand the shrillest of minds; sticking ornamental pins into his shirt,\r\nand keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger\r\nby stealth, when the pupils went out walking; constantly falling in\r\nlove by sight with nurserymaids, who had no idea of his existence; and\r\nlooking at the gas-lighted world over the little iron bars in the\r\nleft-hand corner window of the front three pairs of stairs, after\r\nbed-time, like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was a portly gentleman in a suit of black, with strings at\r\nhis knees, and stockings below them. He had a bald head, highly\r\npolished; a deep voice; and a chin so very double, that it was a wonder\r\nhow he ever managed to shave into the creases. He had likewise a pair\r\nof little eyes that were always half shut up, and a mouth that was\r\nalways half expanded into a grin, as if he had, that moment, posed a\r\nboy, and were waiting to convict him from his own lips. Insomuch, that\r\nwhen the Doctor put his right hand into the breast of his coat, and\r\nwith his other hand behind him, and a scarcely perceptible wag of his\r\nhead, made the commonest observation to a nervous stranger, it was like\r\na sentiment from the sphynx, and settled his business.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s was a mighty fine house, fronting the sea. Not a joyful\r\nstyle of house within, but quite the contrary. Sad-coloured curtains,\r\nwhose proportions were spare and lean, hid themselves despondently\r\nbehind the windows. The tables and chairs were put away in rows, like\r\nfigures in a sum; fires were so rarely lighted in the rooms of\r\nceremony, that they felt like wells, and a visitor represented the\r\nbucket; the dining-room seemed the last place in the world where any\r\neating or drinking was likely to occur; there was no sound through all\r\nthe house but the ticking of a great clock in the hall, which made\r\nitself audible in the very garrets; and sometimes a dull cooing of\r\nyoung gentlemen at their lessons, like the murmurings of an assemblage\r\nof melancholy pigeons.\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber, too, although a slim and graceful maid, did no soft\r\nviolence to the gravity of the house. There was no light nonsense about\r\nMiss Blimber. She kept her hair short and crisp, and wore spectacles.\r\nShe was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages.\r\nNone of your live languages for Miss Blimber. They must be dead\xe2\x80\x94stone\r\ndead\xe2\x80\x94and then Miss Blimber dug them up like a Ghoul.\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber, her Mama, was not learned herself, but she pretended to\r\nbe, and that did quite as well. She said at evening parties, that if\r\nshe could have known Cicero, she thought she could have died contented.\r\nIt was the steady joy of her life to see the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s young gentlemen\r\ngo out walking, unlike all other young gentlemen, in the largest\r\npossible shirt-collars, and the stiffest possible cravats. It was so\r\nclassical, she said.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr Feeder, B.A., Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, he was a kind of\r\nhuman barrel-organ, with a little list of tunes at which he was\r\ncontinually working, over and over again, without any variation. He\r\nmight have been fitted up with a change of barrels, perhaps, in early\r\nlife, if his destiny had been favourable; but it had not been; and he\r\nhad only one, with which, in a monotonous round, it was his occupation\r\nto bewilder the young ideas of Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s young gentlemen. The\r\nyoung gentlemen were prematurely full of carking anxieties. They knew\r\nno rest from the pursuit of stony-hearted verbs, savage\r\nnoun-substantives, inflexible syntactic passages, and ghosts of\r\nexercises that appeared to them in their dreams. Under the forcing\r\nsystem, a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three\r\nweeks. He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months.\r\nHe conceived bitter sentiments against his parents or guardians in\r\nfour; he was an old misanthrope, in five; envied Curtius that blessed\r\nrefuge in the earth, in six; and at the end of the first twelvemonth\r\nhad arrived at the conclusion, from which he never afterwards departed,\r\nthat all the fancies of the poets, and lessons of the sages, were a\r\nmere collection of words and grammar, and had no other meaning in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut he went on blow, blow, blowing, in the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hothouse, all the\r\ntime; and the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s glory and reputation were great, when he took\r\nhis wintry growth home to his relations and friends.\r\n\r\nUpon the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s door-steps one day, Paul stood with a fluttering\r\nheart, and with his small right hand in his father\xe2\x80\x99s. His other hand\r\nwas locked in that of Florence. How tight the tiny pressure of that\r\none; and how loose and cold the other!\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin hovered behind the victim, with her sable plumage and her\r\nhooked beak, like a bird of ill-omen. She was out of breath\xe2\x80\x94for Mr\r\nDombey, full of great thoughts, had walked fast\xe2\x80\x94and she croaked\r\nhoarsely as she waited for the opening of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, exultingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way indeed to be\r\nDombey and Son, and have money. You are almost a man already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child.\r\n\r\nEven his childish agitation could not master the sly and quaint yet\r\ntouching look, with which he accompanied the reply.\r\n\r\nIt brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face;\r\nbut the door being opened, it was quickly gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Blimber is at home, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nThe man said yes; and as they passed in, looked at Paul as if he were a\r\nlittle mouse, and the house were a trap. He was a weak-eyed young man,\r\nwith the first faint streaks or early dawn of a grin on his\r\ncountenance. It was mere imbecility; but Mrs Pipchin took it into her\r\nhead that it was impudence, and made a snap at him directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you laugh behind the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s back?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you take me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a laughing at nobody, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t take you for\r\nnothing, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young man, in consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pack of idle dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9conly fit to be turnspits. Go\r\nand tell your master that Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s here, or it\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weak-eyed young man went, very meekly, to discharge himself of this\r\ncommission; and soon came back to invite them to the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re laughing again, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, when it came to her\r\nturn, bringing up the rear, to pass him in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young man, grievously oppressed. \xe2\x80\x9cI never see\r\nsuch a thing as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Mrs Pipchin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, looking round.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly! Pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin, in her deference, merely muttered at the young man as she\r\npassed on, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! he was a precious fellow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94leaving the young\r\nman, who was all meekness and incapacity, affected even to tears by the\r\nincident. But Mrs Pipchin had a way of falling foul of all meek people;\r\nand her friends said who could wonder at it, after the Peruvian mines!\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was sitting in his portentous study, with a globe at each\r\nknee, books all round him, Homer over the door, and Minerva on the\r\nmantel-shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you do, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cand how\r\nis my little friend?\xe2\x80\x9d Grave as an organ was the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s speech; and\r\nwhen he ceased, the great clock in the hall seemed (to Paul at least)\r\nto take him up, and to go on saying, \xe2\x80\x9chow, is, my, lit, tle, friend?\r\nhow, is, my, lit, tle, friend?\xe2\x80\x9d over and over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe little friend being something too small to be seen at all from\r\nwhere the Doctor sat, over the books on his table, the Doctor made\r\nseveral futile attempts to get a view of him round the legs; which Mr\r\nDombey perceiving, relieved the Doctor from his embarrassment by taking\r\nPaul up in his arms, and sitting him on another little table, over\r\nagainst the Doctor, in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, leaning back in his chair with his hand in his\r\nbreast. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I see my little friend. How do you do, my little friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clock in the hall wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t subscribe to this alteration in the form\r\nof words, but continued to repeat how, is, my, lit, tle, friend? how,\r\nis, my, lit, tle, friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul, answering the clock quite\r\nas much as the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we make a man of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Dombey; Paul being silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we make a man of him?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather be a child,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child sat on the table looking at him, with a curious expression of\r\nsuppressed emotion in his face, and beating one hand proudly on his\r\nknee as if he had the rising tears beneath it, and crushed them. But\r\nhis other hand strayed a little way the while, a little farther\xe2\x80\x94farther\r\nfrom him yet\xe2\x80\x94until it lighted on the neck of Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nit seemed to say, and then the steady look was broken up and gone; the\r\nworking lip was loosened; and the tears came streaming forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, in a querulous manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI am really\r\nvery sorry to see this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away from him, do, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, blandly nodding his head, to keep Mrs\r\nPipchin back. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; we shall substitute new cares and new\r\nimpressions, Mr Dombey, very shortly. You would still wish my little\r\nfriend to acquire\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, if you please, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, who, with his half-shut eyes, and his usual\r\nsmile, seemed to survey Paul with the sort of interest that might\r\nattach to some choice little animal he was going to stuff. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nexactly. Ha! We shall impart a great variety of information to our\r\nlittle friend, and bring him quickly forward, I daresay. I daresay.\r\nQuite a virgin soil, I believe you said, Mr Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept some ordinary preparation at home, and from this lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMr Dombey, introducing Mrs Pipchin, who instantly communicated a\r\nrigidity to her whole muscular system, and snorted defiance beforehand,\r\nin case the Doctor should disparage her; \xe2\x80\x9cexcept so far, Paul has, as\r\nyet, applied himself to no studies at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Blimber inclined his head, in gentle tolerance of such\r\ninsignificant poaching as Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s, and said he was glad to hear\r\nit. It was much more satisfactory, he observed, rubbing his hands, to\r\nbegin at the foundation. And again he leered at Paul, as if he would\r\nhave liked to tackle him with the Greek alphabet, on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat circumstance, indeed, Doctor Blimber,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey,\r\nglancing at his little son, \xe2\x80\x9cand the interview I have already had the\r\npleasure of holding with you, renders any further explanation, and\r\nconsequently, any further intrusion on your valuable time, so\r\nunnecessary, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d said the acid Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cone moment. Allow me to present Mrs\r\nBlimber and my daughter; who will be associated with the domestic life\r\nof our young Pilgrim to Parnassus Mrs Blimber,\xe2\x80\x9d for the lady, who had\r\nperhaps been in waiting, opportunely entered, followed by her daughter,\r\nthat fair Sexton in spectacles, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey. My daughter Cornelia, Mr\r\nDombey. Mr Dombey, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Doctor, turning to his wife,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis so confiding as to\xe2\x80\x94do you see our little friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber, in an excess of politeness, of which Mr Dombey was the\r\nobject, apparently did not, for she was backing against the little\r\nfriend, and very much endangering his position on the table. But, on\r\nthis hint, she turned to admire his classical and intellectual\r\nlineaments, and turning again to Mr Dombey, said, with a sigh, that she\r\nenvied his dear son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a bee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber, with uplifted eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cabout to\r\nplunge into a garden of the choicest flowers, and sip the sweets for\r\nthe first time Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Terence, Plautus, Cicero. What a\r\nworld of honey have we here. It may appear remarkable, Mr Dombey, in\r\none who is a wife\xe2\x80\x94the wife of such a husband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cFie for shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey will forgive the partiality of a wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber,\r\nwith an engaging smile.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey answered \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all:\xe2\x80\x9d applying those words, it is to be\r\npresumed, to the partiality, and not to the forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it may seem remarkable in one who is a mother also,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs\r\nBlimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd such a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey, bowing with some confused idea\r\nof being complimentary to Cornelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut really,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cI think if I could have known\r\nCicero, and been his friend, and talked with him in his retirement at\r\nTusculum (beau-ti-ful Tusculum!), I could have died contented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA learned enthusiasm is so very contagious, that Mr Dombey half\r\nbelieved this was exactly his case; and even Mrs Pipchin, who was not,\r\nas we have seen, of an accommodating disposition generally, gave\r\nutterance to a little sound between a groan and a sigh, as if she would\r\nhave said that nobody but Cicero could have proved a lasting\r\nconsolation under that failure of the Peruvian Mines, but that he\r\nindeed would have been a very Davy-lamp of refuge.\r\n\r\nCornelia looked at Mr Dombey through her spectacles, as if she would\r\nhave liked to crack a few quotations with him from the authority in\r\nquestion. But this design, if she entertained it, was frustrated by a\r\nknock at the room-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Come in, Toots; come in. Mr\r\nDombey, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Toots bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite a coincidence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we have the beginning and the end. Alpha and Omega. Our head boy,\r\nMr Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor might have called him their head and shoulders boy, for he\r\nwas at least that much taller than any of the rest. He blushed very\r\nmuch at finding himself among strangers, and chuckled aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn addition to our little Portico, Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cMr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Toots blushed again; and finding, from a solemn silence which\r\nprevailed, that he was expected to say something, said to Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice so deep, and a manner so sheepish, that if a lamb\r\nhad roared it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more surprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mr Feeder, if you please, Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cto prepare a\r\nfew introductory volumes for Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s son, and to allot him a\r\nconvenient seat for study. My dear, I believe Mr Dombey has not seen\r\nthe dormitories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr Dombey will walk upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be more\r\nthan proud to show him the dominions of the drowsy god.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Mrs Blimber, who was a lady of great suavity, and a wiry\r\nfigure, and who wore a cap composed of sky-blue materials, proceeded\r\nupstairs with Mr Dombey and Cornelia; Mrs Pipchin following, and\r\nlooking out sharp for her enemy the footman.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone, Paul sat upon the table, holding Florence by the\r\nhand, and glancing timidly from the Doctor round and round the room,\r\nwhile the Doctor, leaning back in his chair, with his hand in his\r\nbreast as usual, held a book from him at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, and read. There\r\nwas something very awful in this manner of reading. It was such a\r\ndetermined, unimpassioned, inflexible, cold-blooded way of going to\r\nwork. It left the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s countenance exposed to view; and when the\r\nDoctor smiled suspiciously at his author, or knit his brows, or shook\r\nhis head and made wry faces at him, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\r\nSir; I know better,\xe2\x80\x9d it was terrific.\r\n\r\nToots, too, had no business to be outside the door, ostentatiously\r\nexamining the wheels in his watch, and counting his half-crowns. But\r\nthat didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long; for Doctor Blimber, happening to change the\r\nposition of his tight plump legs, as if he were going to get up, Toots\r\nswiftly vanished, and appeared no more.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey and his conductress were soon heard coming downstairs again,\r\ntalking all the way; and presently they re-entered the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, laying down his book, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\narrangements meet your approval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are excellent, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fair, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, in a low voice; never disposed\r\nto give too much encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, wheeling round, \xe2\x80\x9cwill, with your\r\npermission, Doctor and Mrs Blimber, visit Paul now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever Mrs Pipchin pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways happy to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI have given all the trouble I need, and\r\nmay take my leave. Paul, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d he went close to him, as he sat\r\nupon the table. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe limp and careless little hand that Mr Dombey took in his, was\r\nsingularly out of keeping with the wistful face. But he had no part in\r\nits sorrowful expression. It was not addressed to him. No, no. To\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x94all to Florence.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Dombey in his insolence of wealth, had ever made an enemy, hard\r\nto appease and cruelly vindictive in his hate, even such an enemy might\r\nhave received the pang that wrung his proud heart then, as compensation\r\nfor his injury.\r\n\r\nHe bent down, over his boy, and kissed him. If his sight were dimmed as\r\nhe did so, by something that for a moment blurred the little face, and\r\nmade it indistinct to him, his mental vision may have been, for that\r\nshort time, the clearer perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you soon, Paul. You are free on Saturdays and Sundays, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul: looking at his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cOn Saturdays and\r\nSundays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll try and learn a great deal here, and be a clever man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Dombey; \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the child, wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be grown up now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very soon!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the child. Once more the old, old look passed\r\nrapidly across his features like a strange light. It fell on Mrs\r\nPipchin, and extinguished itself in her black dress. That excellent\r\nogress stepped forward to take leave and to bear off Florence, which\r\nshe had long been thirsting to do. The move on her part roused Mr\r\nDombey, whose eyes were fixed on Paul. After patting him on the head,\r\nand pressing his small hand again, he took leave of Doctor Blimber, Mrs\r\nBlimber, and Miss Blimber, with his usual polite frigidity, and walked\r\nout of the study.\r\n\r\nDespite his entreaty that they would not think of stirring, Doctor\r\nBlimber, Mrs Blimber, and Miss Blimber all pressed forward to attend\r\nhim to the hall; and thus Mrs Pipchin got into a state of entanglement\r\nwith Miss Blimber and the Doctor, and was crowded out of the study\r\nbefore she could clutch Florence. To which happy accident Paul stood\r\nafterwards indebted for the dear remembrance, that Florence ran back to\r\nthrow her arms round his neck, and that hers was the last face in the\r\ndoorway: turned towards him with a smile of encouragement, the brighter\r\nfor the tears through which it beamed.\r\n\r\nIt made his childish bosom heave and swell when it was gone; and sent\r\nthe globes, the books, blind Homer and Minerva, swimming round the\r\nroom. But they stopped, all of a sudden; and then he heard the loud\r\nclock in the hall still gravely inquiring \xe2\x80\x9chow, is, my, lit, tle,\r\nfriend? how, is, my, lit, tle, friend?\xe2\x80\x9d as it had done before.\r\n\r\nHe sat, with folded hands, upon his pedestal, silently listening. But\r\nhe might have answered \xe2\x80\x9cweary, weary! very lonely, very sad!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthere, with an aching void in his young heart, and all outside so cold,\r\nand bare, and strange, Paul sat as if he had taken life unfurnished,\r\nand the upholsterer were never coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s Education\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of some minutes, which appeared an immense time to\r\nlittle Paul Dombey on the table, Doctor Blimber came back. The Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk was stately, and calculated to impress the juvenile mind with\r\nsolemn feelings. It was a sort of march; but when the Doctor put out\r\nhis right foot, he gravely turned upon his axis, with a semi-circular\r\nsweep towards the left; and when he put out his left foot, he turned in\r\nthe same manner towards the right. So that he seemed, at every stride\r\nhe took, to look about him as though he were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCan anybody have\r\nthe goodness to indicate any subject, in any direction, on which I am\r\nuninformed? I rather think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber and Miss Blimber came back in the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s company; and the\r\nDoctor, lifting his new pupil off the table, delivered him over to Miss\r\nBlimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornelia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cDombey will be your charge at first.\r\nBring him on, Cornelia, bring him on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber received her young ward from the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hands; and Paul,\r\nfeeling that the spectacles were surveying him, cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Paul, wondering, as he stole a glance at the young\r\nlady, why her hair didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow long like Florence\xe2\x80\x99s, and why she was\r\nlike a boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you know of your Latin Grammar, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nBlimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Paul. Feeling that the answer was a shock to\r\nMiss Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s sensibility, he looked up at the three faces that were\r\nlooking down at him, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been well. I have been a weak child. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t learn a\r\nLatin Grammar when I was out, every day, with old Glubb. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntell old Glubb to come and see me, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dreadfully low name\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cUnclassical to a\r\ndegree! Who is the monster, child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat monster?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlubb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber, with a great disrelish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s no more a monster than you are,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Doctor, in a terrible voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay? Aha! What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul was dreadfully frightened; but still he made a stand for the\r\nabsent Glubb, though he did it trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice old man, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe used to draw my couch.\r\nHe knows all about the deep sea, and the fish that are in it, and the\r\ngreat monsters that come and lie on rocks in the sun, and dive into the\r\nwater again when they\xe2\x80\x99re startled, blowing and splashing so, that they\r\ncan be heard for miles. There are some creatures, said Paul, warming\r\nwith his subject, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many yards long, and I forget their\r\nnames, but Florence knows, that pretend to be in distress; and when a\r\nman goes near them, out of compassion, they open their great jaws, and\r\nattack him. But all he has got to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, boldly tendering this\r\ninformation to the very Doctor himself, \xe2\x80\x9cis to keep on turning as he\r\nruns away, and then, as they turn slowly, because they are so long, and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bend, he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to beat them. And though old Glubb don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\r\nthe sea should make me think of my Mama that\xe2\x80\x99s dead, or what it is that\r\nit is always saying\xe2\x80\x94always saying! he knows a great deal about it. And\r\nI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d the child concluded, with a sudden falling of his countenance,\r\nand failing in his animation, as he looked like one forlorn, upon the\r\nthree strange faces, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99d let old Glubb come here to see me, for\r\nI know him very well, and he knows me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is bad, but study will\r\ndo much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber opined, with something like a shiver, that he was an\r\nunaccountable child; and, allowing for the difference of visage, looked\r\nat him pretty much as Mrs Pipchin had been used to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him round the house, Cornelia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand familiarise\r\nhim with his new sphere. Go with that young lady, Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDombey obeyed; giving his hand to the abstruse Cornelia, and looking at\r\nher sideways, with timid curiosity, as they went away together. For her\r\nspectacles, by reason of the glistening of the glasses, made her so\r\nmysterious, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where she was looking, and was not\r\nindeed quite sure that she had any eyes at all behind them.\r\n\r\nCornelia took him first to the schoolroom, which was situated at the\r\nback of the hall, and was approached through two baize doors, which\r\ndeadened and muffled the young gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s voices. Here, there were\r\neight young gentlemen in various stages of mental prostration, all very\r\nhard at work, and very grave indeed. Toots, as an old hand, had a desk\r\nto himself in one corner: and a magnificent man, of immense age, he\r\nlooked, in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s young eyes, behind it.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder, B.A., who sat at another little desk, had his Virgil stop\r\non, and was slowly grinding that tune to four young gentlemen. Of the\r\nremaining four, two, who grasped their foreheads convulsively, were\r\nengaged in solving mathematical problems; one with his face like a\r\ndirty window, from much crying, was endeavouring to flounder through a\r\nhopeless number of lines before dinner; and one sat looking at his task\r\nin stony stupefaction and despair\xe2\x80\x94which it seemed had been his\r\ncondition ever since breakfast time.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a new boy did not create the sensation that might\r\nhave been expected. Mr Feeder, B.A. (who was in the habit of shaving\r\nhis head for coolness, and had nothing but little bristles on it), gave\r\nhim a bony hand, and told him he was glad to see him\xe2\x80\x94which Paul would\r\nhave been very glad to have told him, if he could have done so with the\r\nleast sincerity. Then Paul, instructed by Cornelia, shook hands with\r\nthe four young gentlemen at Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s desk; then with the two young\r\ngentlemen at work on the problems, who were very feverish; then with\r\nthe young gentleman at work against time, who was very inky; and lastly\r\nwith the young gentleman in a state of stupefaction, who was flabby and\r\nquite cold.\r\n\r\nPaul having been already introduced to Toots, that pupil merely\r\nchuckled and breathed hard, as his custom was, and pursued the\r\noccupation in which he was engaged. It was not a severe one; for on\r\naccount of his having \xe2\x80\x9cgone through\xe2\x80\x9d so much (in more senses than one),\r\nand also of his having, as before hinted, left off blowing in his\r\nprime, Toots now had licence to pursue his own course of study: which\r\nwas chiefly to write long letters to himself from persons of\r\ndistinction, adds \xe2\x80\x9cP. Toots, Esquire, Brighton, Sussex,\xe2\x80\x9d and to\r\npreserve them in his desk with great care.\r\n\r\nThese ceremonies passed, Cornelia led Paul upstairs to the top of the\r\nhouse; which was rather a slow journey, on account of Paul being\r\nobliged to land both feet on every stair, before he mounted another.\r\nBut they reached their journey\xe2\x80\x99s end at last; and there, in a front\r\nroom, looking over the wild sea, Cornelia showed him a nice little bed\r\nwith white hangings, close to the window, on which there was already\r\nbeautifully written on a card in round text\xe2\x80\x94down strokes very thick,\r\nand up strokes very fine\xe2\x80\x94DOMBEY; while two other little bedsteads in\r\nthe same room were announced, through like means, as respectively\r\nappertaining unto BRIGGS and TOZER.\r\n\r\nJust as they got downstairs again into the hall, Paul saw the weak-eyed\r\nyoung man who had given that mortal offence to Mrs Pipchin, suddenly\r\nseize a very large drumstick, and fly at a gong that was hanging up, as\r\nif he had gone mad, or wanted vengeance. Instead of receiving warning,\r\nhowever, or being instantly taken into custody, the young man left off\r\nunchecked, after having made a dreadful noise. Then Cornelia Blimber\r\nsaid to Dombey that dinner would be ready in a quarter of an hour, and\r\nperhaps he had better go into the schoolroom among his \xe2\x80\x9cfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Dombey, deferentially passing the great clock which was still as\r\nanxious as ever to know how he found himself, opened the schoolroom\r\ndoor a very little way, and strayed in like a lost boy: shutting it\r\nafter him with some difficulty. His friends were all dispersed about\r\nthe room except the stony friend, who remained immoveable. Mr Feeder\r\nwas stretching himself in his grey gown, as if, regardless of expense,\r\nhe were resolved to pull the sleeves off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeigh ho hum!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Feeder, shaking himself like a cart-horse. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\ndear me, dear me! Ya-a-a-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul was quite alarmed by Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s yawning; it was done on such a\r\ngreat scale, and he was so terribly in earnest. All the boys too (Toots\r\nexcepted) seemed knocked up, and were getting ready for dinner\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nnewly tying their neckcloths, which were very stiff indeed; and others\r\nwashing their hands or brushing their hair, in an adjoining\r\nante-chamber\xe2\x80\x94as if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they should enjoy it at all.\r\n\r\nYoung Toots who was ready beforehand, and had therefore nothing to do,\r\nand had leisure to bestow upon Paul, said, with heavy good nature:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\nHis endeavouring to hoist himself on to a very high window-seat, and\r\nhis slipping down again, appeared to prepare Toots\xe2\x80\x99s mind for the\r\nreception of a discovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a very small chap;\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m small,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Toots had lifted him into the seat, and done it kindly too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s your tailor?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Toots, after looking at him for some\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a woman that has made my clothes as yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy tailor\xe2\x80\x99s Burgess and Co.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cFash\xe2\x80\x99nable. But very dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul had wit enough to shake his head, as if he would have said it was\r\neasy to see that; and indeed he thought so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father\xe2\x80\x99s regularly rich, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Dombey and Son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Son, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paul.\r\n\r\nMr Toots made one or two attempts, in a low voice, to fix the Firm in\r\nhis mind; but not quite succeeding, said he would get Paul to mention\r\nthe name again to-morrow morning, as it was rather important. And\r\nindeed he purposed nothing less than writing himself a private and\r\nconfidential letter from Dombey and Son immediately.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other pupils (always excepting the stony boy) gathered\r\nround. They were polite, but pale; and spoke low; and they were so\r\ndepressed in their spirits, that in comparison with the general tone of\r\nthat company, Master Bitherstone was a perfect Miller, or complete Jest\r\nBook.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet he had a sense of injury upon him, too, had Bitherstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sleep in my room, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a solemn young gentleman,\r\nwhose shirt-collar curled up the lobes of his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Briggs?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTozer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young gentleman.\r\n\r\nPaul answered yes; and Tozer pointing out the stony pupil, said that\r\nwas Briggs. Paul had already felt certain that it must be either Briggs\r\nor Tozer, though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs yours a strong constitution?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tozer.\r\n\r\nPaul said he thought not. Tozer replied that he thought not also,\r\njudging from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s looks, and that it was a pity, for it need be. He\r\nthen asked Paul if he were going to begin with Cornelia; and on Paul\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d all the young gentlemen (Briggs excepted) gave a low\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\nIt was drowned in the tintinnabulation of the gong, which sounding\r\nagain with great fury, there was a general move towards the\r\ndining-room; still excepting Briggs the stony boy, who remained where\r\nhe was, and as he was; and on its way to whom Paul presently\r\nencountered a round of bread, genteelly served on a plate and napkin,\r\nand with a silver fork lying crosswise on the top of it. Doctor Blimber\r\nwas already in his place in the dining-room, at the top of the table,\r\nwith Miss Blimber and Mrs Blimber on either side of him. Mr Feeder in a\r\nblack coat was at the bottom. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s chair was next to Miss Blimber;\r\nbut it being found, when he sat in it, that his eyebrows were not much\r\nabove the level of the table-cloth, some books were brought in from the\r\nDoctor\xe2\x80\x99s study, on which he was elevated, and on which he always sat\r\nfrom that time\xe2\x80\x94 carrying them in and out himself on after occasions,\r\nlike a little elephant and castle.\r\n\r\nGrace having been said by the Doctor, dinner began. There was some nice\r\nsoup; also roast meat, boiled meat, vegetables, pie, and cheese. Every\r\nyoung gentleman had a massive silver fork, and a napkin; and all the\r\narrangements were stately and handsome. In particular, there was a\r\nbutler in a blue coat and bright buttons, who gave quite a winey\r\nflavour to the table beer; he poured it out so superbly.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke, unless spoken to, except Doctor Blimber, Mrs Blimber, and\r\nMiss Blimber, who conversed occasionally. Whenever a young gentleman\r\nwas not actually engaged with his knife and fork or spoon, his eye,\r\nwith an irresistible attraction, sought the eye of Doctor Blimber, Mrs\r\nBlimber, or Miss Blimber, and modestly rested there. Toots appeared to\r\nbe the only exception to this rule. He sat next Mr Feeder on Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside of the table, and frequently looked behind and before the\r\nintervening boys to catch a glimpse of Paul.\r\n\r\nOnly once during dinner was there any conversation that included the\r\nyoung gentlemen. It happened at the epoch of the cheese, when the\r\nDoctor, having taken a glass of port wine, and hemmed twice or thrice,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is remarkable, Mr Feeder, that the Romans\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this terrible people, their implacable enemies, every\r\nyoung gentleman fastened his gaze upon the Doctor, with an assumption\r\nof the deepest interest. One of the number who happened to be drinking,\r\nand who caught the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eye glaring at him through the side of his\r\ntumbler, left off so hastily that he was convulsed for some moments,\r\nand in the sequel ruined Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is remarkable, Mr Feeder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, beginning again slowly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Romans, in those gorgeous and profuse entertainments of which\r\nwe read in the days of the Emperors, when luxury had attained a height\r\nunknown before or since, and when whole provinces were ravaged to\r\nsupply the splendid means of one Imperial Banquet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the offender, who had been swelling and straining, and waiting in\r\nvain for a full stop, broke out violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder, in a low reproachful voice, \xe2\x80\x9ctake some\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, looking very stern, made a pause until the water was\r\nbrought, and then resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when, Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr Feeder, who saw that Johnson must break out again, and who knew\r\nthat the Doctor would never come to a period before the young gentlemen\r\nuntil he had finished all he meant to say, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep his eye off\r\nJohnson; and thus was caught in the fact of not looking at the Doctor,\r\nwho consequently stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder, reddening. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your\r\npardon, Doctor Blimber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, raising his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, Sir, as we read,\r\nand have no reason to doubt\xe2\x80\x94incredible as it may appear to the\r\nvulgar\xe2\x80\x94of our time\xe2\x80\x94the brother of Vitellius prepared for him a feast,\r\nin which were served, of fish, two thousand dishes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake some water, Johnson\xe2\x80\x94dishes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf various sorts of fowl, five thousand dishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr try a crust of bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one dish,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Doctor Blimber, raising his voice still higher\r\nas he looked all round the table, \xe2\x80\x9ccalled, from its enormous\r\ndimensions, the Shield of Minerva, and made, among other costly\r\ningredients, of the brains of pheasants\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOw, ow, ow!\xe2\x80\x9d (from Johnson.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoodcocks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOw, ow, ow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sounds of the fish called scari\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll burst some vessel in your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had\r\nbetter let it come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the spawn of the lamprey, brought from the Carpathian Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued the Doctor, in his severest voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we read of costly\r\nentertainments such as these, and still remember, that we have a\r\nTitus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would be your mother\xe2\x80\x99s feelings if you died of apoplexy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nFeeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Domitian\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re blue, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Nero, a Tiberius, a Caligula, a Heliogabalus, and many more, pursued\r\nthe Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cit is, Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x94if you are doing me the honour to\r\nattend\xe2\x80\x94remarkable; VERY remarkable, Sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Johnson, unable to suppress it any longer, burst at that moment\r\ninto such an overwhelming fit of coughing, that although both his\r\nimmediate neighbours thumped him on the back, and Mr Feeder himself\r\nheld a glass of water to his lips, and the butler walked him up and\r\ndown several times between his own chair and the sideboard, like a\r\nsentry, it was a full five minutes before he was moderately composed.\r\nThen there was a profound silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9crise for Grace! Cornelia, lift\r\nDombey down\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nothing of whom but his scalp was accordingly seen above\r\nthe tablecloth. \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson will repeat to me tomorrow morning before\r\nbreakfast, without book, and from the Greek Testament, the first\r\nchapter of the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Ephesians. We will resume\r\nour studies, Mr Feeder, in half-an-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen bowed and withdrew. Mr Feeder did likewise. During\r\nthe half-hour, the young gentlemen, broken into pairs, loitered\r\narm-in-arm up and down a small piece of ground behind the house, or\r\nendeavoured to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of Briggs. But\r\nnothing happened so vulgar as play. Punctually at the appointed time,\r\nthe gong was sounded, and the studies, under the joint auspices of\r\nDoctor Blimber and Mr Feeder, were resumed.\r\n\r\nAs the Olympic game of lounging up and down had been cut shorter than\r\nusual that day, on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s account, they all went out for a walk\r\nbefore tea. Even Briggs (though he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun yet) partook of this\r\ndissipation; in the enjoyment of which he looked over the cliff two or\r\nthree times darkly. Doctor Blimber accompanied them; and Paul had the\r\nhonour of being taken in tow by the Doctor himself: a distinguished\r\nstate of things, in which he looked very little and feeble.\r\n\r\nTea was served in a style no less polite than the dinner; and after\r\ntea, the young gentlemen rising and bowing as before, withdrew to fetch\r\nup the unfinished tasks of that day, or to get up the already looming\r\ntasks of to-morrow. In the meantime Mr Feeder withdrew to his own room;\r\nand Paul sat in a corner wondering whether Florence was thinking of\r\nhim, and what they were all about at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, who had been detained by an important letter from the Duke of\r\nWellington, found Paul out after a time; and having looked at him for a\r\nlong while, as before, inquired if he was fond of waistcoats.\r\n\r\nPaul said \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toots.\r\n\r\nNo word more spoke Toots that night; but he stood looking at Paul as if\r\nhe liked him; and as there was company in that, and Paul was not\r\ninclined to talk, it answered his purpose better than conversation.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock or so, the gong sounded again for prayers in the\r\ndining-room, where the butler afterwards presided over a side-table, on\r\nwhich bread and cheese and beer were spread for such young gentlemen as\r\ndesired to partake of those refreshments. The ceremonies concluded by\r\nthe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we will resume our studies at seven\r\nto-morrow;\xe2\x80\x9d and then, for the first time, Paul saw Cornelia Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye, and saw that it was upon him. When the Doctor had said these\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\npupils bowed again, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nIn the confidence of their own room upstairs, Briggs said his head\r\nached ready to split, and that he should wish himself dead if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor his mother, and a blackbird he had at home. Tozer didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much,\r\nbut he sighed a good deal, and told Paul to look out, for his turn\r\nwould come to-morrow. After uttering those prophetic words, he\r\nundressed himself moodily, and got into bed. Briggs was in his bed too,\r\nand Paul in his bed too, before the weak-eyed young man appeared to\r\ntake away the candle, when he wished them good-night and pleasant\r\ndreams. But his benevolent wishes were in vain, as far as Briggs and\r\nTozer were concerned; for Paul, who lay awake for a long while, and\r\noften woke afterwards, found that Briggs was ridden by his lesson as a\r\nnightmare: and that Tozer, whose mind was affected in his sleep by\r\nsimilar causes, in a minor degree talked unknown tongues, or scraps of\r\nGreek and Latin\xe2\x80\x94it was all one to Paul\xe2\x80\x94which, in the silence of night,\r\nhad an inexpressibly wicked and guilty effect.\r\n\r\nPaul had sunk into a sweet sleep, and dreamed that he was walking hand\r\nin hand with Florence through beautiful gardens, when they came to a\r\nlarge sunflower which suddenly expanded itself into a gong, and began\r\nto sound. Opening his eyes, he found that it was a dark, windy morning,\r\nwith a drizzling rain: and that the real gong was giving dreadful note\r\nof preparation, down in the hall.\r\n\r\nSo he got up directly, and found Briggs with hardly any eyes, for\r\nnightmare and grief had made his face puffy, putting his boots on:\r\nwhile Tozer stood shivering and rubbing his shoulders in a very bad\r\nhumour. Poor Paul couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dress himself easily, not being used to it,\r\nand asked them if they would have the goodness to tie some strings for\r\nhim; but as Briggs merely said \xe2\x80\x9cBother!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tozer, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\ndown when he was otherwise ready, to the next storey, where he saw a\r\npretty young woman in leather gloves, cleaning a stove. The young woman\r\nseemed surprised at his appearance, and asked him where his mother was.\r\nWhen Paul told her she was dead, she took her gloves off, and did what\r\nhe wanted; and furthermore rubbed his hands to warm them; and gave him\r\na kiss; and told him whenever he wanted anything of that sort\xe2\x80\x94meaning\r\nin the dressing way\xe2\x80\x94to ask for \xe2\x80\x9cMelia; which Paul, thanking her very\r\nmuch, said he certainly would. He then proceeded softly on his journey\r\ndownstairs, towards the room in which the young gentlemen resumed their\r\nstudies, when, passing by a door that stood ajar, a voice from within\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d On Paul replying, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am:\xe2\x80\x9d for he knew\r\nthe voice to be Miss Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s: Miss Blimber said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd in he went.\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber presented exactly the appearance she had presented\r\nyesterday, except that she wore a shawl. Her little light curls were as\r\ncrisp as ever, and she had already her spectacles on, which made Paul\r\nwonder whether she went to bed in them. She had a cool little\r\nsitting-room of her own up there, with some books in it, and no fire\r\nBut Miss Blimber was never cold, and never sleepy.\r\n\r\nNow, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going out for a constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul wondered what that was, and why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t send the footman out to\r\nget it in such unfavourable weather. But he made no observation on the\r\nsubject: his attention being devoted to a little pile of new books, on\r\nwhich Miss Blimber appeared to have been recently engaged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are yours, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of \xe2\x80\x99em, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Blimber; \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr Feeder will look you out some\r\nmore very soon, if you are as studious as I expect you will be,\r\nDombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going out for a constitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miss Blimber; \xe2\x80\x9cand while\r\nI am gone, that is to say in the interval between this and breakfast,\r\nDombey, I wish you to read over what I have marked in these books, and\r\nto tell me if you quite understand what you have got to learn. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlose time, Dombey, for you have none to spare, but take them\r\ndownstairs, and begin directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Paul.\r\n\r\nThere were so many of them, that although Paul put one hand under the\r\nbottom book and his other hand and his chin on the top book, and hugged\r\nthem all closely, the middle book slipped out before he reached the\r\ndoor, and then they all tumbled down on the floor. Miss Blimber said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dombey, Dombey, this is really very careless!\xe2\x80\x9d and piled them up\r\nafresh for him; and this time, by dint of balancing them with great\r\nnicety, Paul got out of the room, and down a few stairs before two of\r\nthem escaped again. But he held the rest so tight, that he only left\r\none more on the first floor, and one in the passage; and when he had\r\ngot the main body down into the schoolroom, he set off upstairs again\r\nto collect the stragglers. Having at last amassed the whole library,\r\nand climbed into his place, he fell to work, encouraged by a remark\r\nfrom Tozer to the effect that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas in for it now;\xe2\x80\x9d which was the\r\nonly interruption he received till breakfast time. At that meal, for\r\nwhich he had no appetite, everything was quite as solemn and genteel as\r\nat the others; and when it was finished, he followed Miss Blimber\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cHow have you got on with those\r\nbooks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey comprised a little English, and a deal of Latin\xe2\x80\x94names of things,\r\ndeclensions of articles and substantives, exercises thereon, and\r\npreliminary rules\xe2\x80\x94a trifle of orthography, a glance at ancient history,\r\na wink or two at modern ditto, a few tables, two or three weights and\r\nmeasures, and a little general information. When poor Paul had spelt\r\nout number two, he found he had no idea of number one; fragments\r\nwhereof afterwards obtruded themselves into number three, which slided\r\ninto number four, which grafted itself on to number two. So that\r\nwhether twenty Romuluses made a Remus, or hic haec hoc was troy weight,\r\nor a verb always agreed with an ancient Briton, or three times four was\r\nTaurus a bull, were open questions with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dombey, Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is very shocking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cI think if I might sometimes talk a little\r\nto old Glubb, I should be able to do better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it. This is\r\nnot the place for Glubbs of any kind. You must take the books down, I\r\nsuppose, Dombey, one by one, and perfect yourself in the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstalment of subject A, before you turn at all to subject B. I am\r\nsorry to say, Dombey, that your education appears to have been very\r\nmuch neglected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Papa says,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I told you\xe2\x80\x94I have been a weak\r\nchild. Florence knows I have. So does Wickam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Wickam?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Blimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been my nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you not to mention Wickam to me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou asked me who she was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Blimber; \xe2\x80\x9cbut this is all very different\r\nindeed from anything of that sort, Dombey, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\npermitting it. As to having been weak, you must begin to be strong. And\r\nnow take away the top book, if you please, Dombey, and return when you\r\nare master of the theme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber expressed her opinions on the subject of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuninstructed state with a gloomy delight, as if she had expected this\r\nresult, and were glad to find that they must be in constant\r\ncommunication. Paul withdrew with the top task, as he was told, and\r\nlaboured away at it, down below: sometimes remembering every word of\r\nit, and sometimes forgetting it all, and everything else besides: until\r\nat last he ventured upstairs again to repeat the lesson, when it was\r\nnearly all driven out of his head before he began, by Miss Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshutting up the book, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d a proceeding so\r\nsuggestive of the knowledge inside of her, that Paul looked upon the\r\nyoung lady with consternation, as a kind of learned Guy Fawkes, or\r\nartificial Bogle, stuffed full of scholastic straw.\r\n\r\nHe acquitted himself very well, nevertheless; and Miss Blimber,\r\ncommending him as giving promise of getting on fast, immediately\r\nprovided him with subject B; from which he passed to C, and even D\r\nbefore dinner. It was hard work, resuming his studies, soon after\r\ndinner; and he felt giddy and confused and drowsy and dull. But all the\r\nother young gentlemen had similar sensations, and were obliged to\r\nresume their studies too, if there were any comfort in that. It was a\r\nwonder that the great clock in the hall, instead of being constant to\r\nits first inquiry, never said, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we will now resume our\r\nstudies,\xe2\x80\x9d for that phrase was often enough repeated in its\r\nneighbourhood. The studies went round like a mighty wheel, and the\r\nyoung gentlemen were always stretched upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter tea there were exercises again, and preparations for next day by\r\ncandlelight. And in due course there was bed; where, but for that\r\nresumption of the studies which took place in dreams, were rest and\r\nsweet forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nOh Saturdays! Oh happy Saturdays, when Florence always came at noon,\r\nand never would, in any weather, stay away, though Mrs Pipchin snarled\r\nand growled, and worried her bitterly. Those Saturdays were Sabbaths\r\nfor at least two little Christians among all the Jews, and did the holy\r\nSabbath work of strengthening and knitting up a brother\xe2\x80\x99s and a\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\nNot even Sunday nights\xe2\x80\x94the heavy Sunday nights, whose shadow darkened\r\nthe first waking burst of light on Sunday mornings\xe2\x80\x94could mar those\r\nprecious Saturdays. Whether it was the great sea-shore, where they sat,\r\nand strolled together; or whether it was only Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s dull back\r\nroom, in which she sang to him so softly, with his drowsy head upon her\r\narm; Paul never cared. It was Florence. That was all he thought of. So,\r\non Sunday nights, when the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s dark door stood agape to swallow\r\nhim up for another week, the time was come for taking leave of\r\nFlorence; no one else.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam had been drafted home to the house in town, and Miss Nipper,\r\nnow a smart young woman, had come down. To many a single combat with\r\nMrs Pipchin, did Miss Nipper gallantly devote herself, and if ever Mrs\r\nPipchin in all her life had found her match, she had found it now. Miss\r\nNipper threw away the scabbard the first morning she arose in Mrs\r\nPipchin\xe2\x80\x99s house. She asked and gave no quarter. She said it must be\r\nwar, and war it was; and Mrs Pipchin lived from that time in the midst\r\nof surprises, harassings, and defiances, and skirmishing attacks that\r\ncame bouncing in upon her from the passage, even in unguarded moments\r\nof chops, and carried desolation to her very toast.\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper had returned one Sunday night with Florence, from walking\r\nback with Paul to the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s, when Florence took from her bosom a\r\nlittle piece of paper, on which she had pencilled down some words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the names of the little books\r\nthat Paul brings home to do those long exercises with, when he is so\r\ntired. I copied them last night while he was writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t show \xe2\x80\x99em to me, Miss Floy, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nas soon see Mrs Pipchin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to buy them for me, Susan, if you will, tomorrow morning. I\r\nhave money enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, goodness gracious me, Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9chow can\r\nyou talk like that, when you have books upon books already, and\r\nmasterses and mississes a teaching of you everything continual, though\r\nmy belief is that your Pa, Miss Dombey, never would have learnt you\r\nnothing, never would have thought of it, unless you\xe2\x80\x99d asked him\xe2\x80\x94when he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t well refuse; but giving consent when asked, and offering when\r\nunasked, Miss, is quite two things; I may not have my objections to a\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s keeping company with me, and when he puts the question, may\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 but that\xe2\x80\x99s not saying \xe2\x80\x98would you be so kind as like me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can buy me the books, Susan; and you will, when you know why I\r\nwant them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss, and why do you want \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nipper; adding, in a\r\nlower voice, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was to fling at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s head, I\xe2\x80\x99d buy a\r\ncart-load.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul has a great deal too much to do, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well you may be, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her maid, \xe2\x80\x9cand make your mind\r\nquite easy that the willing dear is worked and worked away. If those is\r\nLatin legs,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Nipper, with strong feeling\xe2\x80\x94in allusion to\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me English ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he feels lonely and lost at Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Florence, turning away her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nipper, with great sharpness, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, them \xe2\x80\x98Blimbers\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing about blame, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know that\r\nyou object, but I may wish, Miss, that the family was set to work to\r\nmake new roads, and that Miss Blimber went in front and had the\r\npickaxe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this speech, Miss Nipper, who was perfectly serious, wiped her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could perhaps give Paul some help, Susan, if I had these\r\nbooks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand make the coming week a little easier to\r\nhim. At least I want to try. So buy them for me, dear, and I will never\r\nforget how kind it was of you to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must have been a harder heart than Susan Nipper\xe2\x80\x99s that could have\r\nrejected the little purse Florence held out with these words, or the\r\ngentle look of entreaty with which she seconded her petition. Susan put\r\nthe purse in her pocket without reply, and trotted out at once upon her\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nThe books were not easy to procure; and the answer at several shops\r\nwas, either that they were just out of them, or that they never kept\r\nthem, or that they had had a great many last month, or that they\r\nexpected a great many next week But Susan was not easily baffled in\r\nsuch an enterprise; and having entrapped a white-haired youth, in a\r\nblack calico apron, from a library where she was known, to accompany\r\nher in her quest, she led him such a life in going up and down, that he\r\nexerted himself to the utmost, if it were only to get rid of her; and\r\nfinally enabled her to return home in triumph.\r\n\r\nWith these treasures then, after her own daily lessons were over,\r\nFlorence sat down at night to track Paul\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps through the thorny\r\nways of learning; and being possessed of a naturally quick and sound\r\ncapacity, and taught by that most wonderful of masters, love, it was\r\nnot long before she gained upon Paul\xe2\x80\x99s heels, and caught and passed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNot a word of this was breathed to Mrs Pipchin: but many a night when\r\nthey were all in bed, and when Miss Nipper, with her hair in papers and\r\nherself asleep in some uncomfortable attitude, reposed unconscious by\r\nher side; and when the chinking ashes in the grate were cold and grey;\r\nand when the candles were burnt down and guttering out;\xe2\x80\x94Florence tried\r\nso hard to be a substitute for one small Dombey, that her fortitude and\r\nperseverance might have almost won her a free right to bear the name\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAnd high was her reward, when one Saturday evening, as little Paul was\r\nsitting down as usual to \xe2\x80\x9cresume his studies,\xe2\x80\x9d she sat down by his\r\nside, and showed him all that was so rough, made smooth, and all that\r\nwas so dark, made clear and plain, before him. It was nothing but a\r\nstartled look in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s wan face\xe2\x80\x94a flush\xe2\x80\x94a smile\xe2\x80\x94and then a close\r\nembrace\xe2\x80\x94but God knows how her heart leapt up at this rich payment for\r\nher trouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her brother, \xe2\x80\x9chow I love you! How I love you, Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I you, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am sure of that, Floy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said no more about it, but all that evening sat close by her, very\r\nquiet; and in the night he called out from his little room within hers,\r\nthree or four times, that he loved her.\r\n\r\nRegularly, after that, Florence was prepared to sit down with Paul on\r\nSaturday night, and patiently assist him through so much as they could\r\nanticipate together of his next week\xe2\x80\x99s work. The cheering thought that\r\nhe was labouring on where Florence had just toiled before him, would,\r\nof itself, have been a stimulant to Paul in the perpetual resumption of\r\nhis studies; but coupled with the actual lightening of his load,\r\nconsequent on this assistance, it saved him, possibly, from sinking\r\nunderneath the burden which the fair Cornelia Blimber piled upon his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt was not that Miss Blimber meant to be too hard upon him, or that\r\nDoctor Blimber meant to bear too heavily on the young gentlemen in\r\ngeneral. Cornelia merely held the faith in which she had been bred; and\r\nthe Doctor, in some partial confusion of his ideas, regarded the young\r\ngentlemen as if they were all Doctors, and were born grown up.\r\nComforted by the applause of the young gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s nearest relations,\r\nand urged on by their blind vanity and ill-considered haste, it would\r\nhave been strange if Doctor Blimber had discovered his mistake, or\r\ntrimmed his swelling sails to any other tack.\r\n\r\nThus in the case of Paul. When Doctor Blimber said he made great\r\nprogress and was naturally clever, Mr Dombey was more bent than ever on\r\nhis being forced and crammed. In the case of Briggs, when Doctor\r\nBlimber reported that he did not make great progress yet, and was not\r\nnaturally clever, Briggs senior was inexorable in the same purpose. In\r\nshort, however high and false the temperature at which the Doctor kept\r\nhis hothouse, the owners of the plants were always ready to lend a\r\nhelping hand at the bellows, and to stir the fire.\r\n\r\nSuch spirits as he had in the outset, Paul soon lost of course. But he\r\nretained all that was strange, and old, and thoughtful in his\r\ncharacter: and under circumstances so favourable to the development of\r\nthose tendencies, became even more strange, and old, and thoughtful,\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nThe only difference was, that he kept his character to himself. He grew\r\nmore thoughtful and reserved, every day; and had no such curiosity in\r\nany living member of the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s household, as he had had in Mrs\r\nPipchin. He loved to be alone; and in those short intervals when he was\r\nnot occupied with his books, liked nothing so well as wandering about\r\nthe house by himself, or sitting on the stairs, listening to the great\r\nclock in the hall. He was intimate with all the paperhanging in the\r\nhouse; saw things that no one else saw in the patterns; found out\r\nminiature tigers and lions running up the bedroom walls, and squinting\r\nfaces leering in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth.\r\n\r\nThe solitary child lived on, surrounded by this arabesque work of his\r\nmusing fancy, and no one understood him. Mrs Blimber thought him \xe2\x80\x9codd,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand sometimes the servants said among themselves that little Dombey\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmoped;\xe2\x80\x9d but that was all.\r\n\r\nUnless young Toots had some idea on the subject, to the expression of\r\nwhich he was wholly unequal. Ideas, like ghosts (according to the\r\ncommon notion of ghosts), must be spoken to a little before they will\r\nexplain themselves; and Toots had long left off asking any questions of\r\nhis own mind. Some mist there may have been, issuing from that leaden\r\ncasket, his cranium, which, if it could have taken shape and form,\r\nwould have become a genie; but it could not; and it only so far\r\nfollowed the example of the smoke in the Arabian story, as to roll out\r\nin a thick cloud, and there hang and hover. But it left a little figure\r\nvisible upon a lonely shore, and Toots was always staring at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to Paul, fifty times a day. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well,\r\nSir, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul would answer. \xe2\x80\x9cShake hands,\xe2\x80\x9d would be Toots\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnext advance.\r\n\r\nWhich Paul, of course, would immediately do. Mr Toots generally said\r\nagain, after a long interval of staring and hard breathing, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d To which Paul again replied, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, Sir, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening Mr Toots was sitting at his desk, oppressed by\r\ncorrespondence, when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him. He laid\r\ndown his pen, and went off to seek Paul, whom he found at last, after a\r\nlong search, looking through the window of his little bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toots, speaking the moment he entered the room, lest he\r\nshould forget it; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I think about a great many things,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, though?\xe2\x80\x9d said Toots, appearing to consider that fact in itself\r\nsurprising. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had to die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, looking up into his face\xe2\x80\x94Mr\r\nToots started, and seemed much disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you would rather die on a moonlight night, when the\r\nsky was quite clear, and the wind blowing, as it did last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots said, looking doubtfully at Paul, and shaking his head, that\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot blowing, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cbut sounding in the air like the\r\nsea sounds in the shells. It was a beautiful night. When I had listened\r\nto the water for a long time, I got up and looked out. There was a boat\r\nover there, in the full light of the moon; a boat with a sail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child looked at him so steadfastly, and spoke so earnestly, that Mr\r\nToots, feeling himself called upon to say something about this boat,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSmugglers.\xe2\x80\x9d But with an impartial remembrance of there being two\r\nsides to every question, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cor Preventive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boat with a sail,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cin the full light of the moon.\r\nThe sail like an arm, all silver. It went away into the distance, and\r\nwhat do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to beckon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, \xe2\x80\x9cto beckon me to come!\xe2\x80\x94There she\r\nis! There she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToots was almost beside himself with dismay at this sudden exclamation,\r\nafter what had gone before, and cried \xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Paul, \xe2\x80\x9clooking up here, and waving her\r\nhand. She sees me\xe2\x80\x94she sees me! Good-night, dear, good-night,\r\ngood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis quick transition to a state of unbounded pleasure, as he stood at\r\nhis window, kissing and clapping his hands: and the way in which the\r\nlight retreated from his features as she passed out of his view, and\r\nleft a patient melancholy on the little face: were too remarkable\r\nwholly to escape even Toots\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Their interview being interrupted\r\nat this moment by a visit from Mrs Pipchin, who usually brought her\r\nblack skirts to bear upon Paul just before dusk, once or twice a week,\r\nToots had no opportunity of improving the occasion: but it left so\r\nmarked an impression on his mind that he twice returned, after having\r\nexchanged the usual salutations, to ask Mrs Pipchin how she did. This\r\nthe irascible old lady conceived to be a deeply devised and\r\nlong-meditated insult, originating in the diabolical invention of the\r\nweak-eyed young man downstairs, against whom she accordingly lodged a\r\nformal complaint with Doctor Blimber that very night; who mentioned to\r\nthe young man that if he ever did it again, he should be obliged to\r\npart with him.\r\n\r\nThe evenings being longer now, Paul stole up to his window every\r\nevening to look out for Florence. She always passed and repassed at a\r\ncertain time, until she saw him; and their mutual recognition was a\r\ngleam of sunshine in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s daily life. Often after dark, one other\r\nfigure walked alone before the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s house. He rarely joined them on\r\nthe Saturdays now. He could not bear it. He would rather come\r\nunrecognised, and look up at the windows where his son was qualifying\r\nfor a man; and wait, and watch, and plan, and hope.\r\n\r\nOh! could he but have seen, or seen as others did, the slight spare boy\r\nabove, watching the waves and clouds at twilight, with his earnest\r\neyes, and breasting the window of his solitary cage when birds flew by,\r\nas if he would have emulated them, and soared away!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nShipping Intelligence and Office Business\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s offices were in a court where there was an old-established\r\nstall of choice fruit at the corner: where perambulating merchants, of\r\nboth sexes, offered for sale at any time between the hours of ten and\r\nfive, slippers, pocket-books, sponges, dogs\xe2\x80\x99 collars, and Windsor soap;\r\nand sometimes a pointer or an oil-painting.\r\n\r\nThe pointer always came that way, with a view to the Stock Exchange,\r\nwhere a sporting taste (originating generally in bets of new hats) is\r\nmuch in vogue. The other commodities were addressed to the general\r\npublic; but they were never offered by the vendors to Mr Dombey. When\r\nhe appeared, the dealers in those wares fell off respectfully. The\r\nprincipal slipper and dogs\xe2\x80\x99 collar man\xe2\x80\x94who considered himself a public\r\ncharacter, and whose portrait was screwed on to an artist\xe2\x80\x99s door in\r\nCheapside\xe2\x80\x94threw up his forefinger to the brim of his hat as Mr Dombey\r\nwent by. The ticket-porter, if he were not absent on a job, always ran\r\nofficiously before, to open Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s office door as wide as\r\npossible, and hold it open, with his hat off, while he entered.\r\n\r\nThe clerks within were not a whit behind-hand in their demonstrations\r\nof respect. A solemn hush prevailed, as Mr Dombey passed through the\r\nouter office. The wit of the Counting-House became in a moment as mute\r\nas the row of leathern fire-buckets hanging up behind him. Such vapid\r\nand flat daylight as filtered through the ground-glass windows and\r\nskylights, leaving a black sediment upon the panes, showed the books\r\nand papers, and the figures bending over them, enveloped in a studious\r\ngloom, and as much abstracted in appearance, from the world without, as\r\nif they were assembled at the bottom of the sea; while a mouldy little\r\nstrong room in the obscure perspective, where a shaded lamp was always\r\nburning, might have represented the cavern of some ocean monster,\r\nlooking on with a red eye at these mysteries of the deep.\r\n\r\nWhen Perch the messenger, whose place was on a little bracket, like a\r\ntimepiece, saw Mr Dombey come in\xe2\x80\x94or rather when he felt that he was\r\ncoming, for he had usually an instinctive sense of his approach\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhurried into Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s room, stirred the fire, carried fresh coals\r\nfrom the bowels of the coal-box, hung the newspaper to air upon the\r\nfender, put the chair ready, and the screen in its place, and was round\r\nupon his heel on the instant of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, to take his\r\ngreat-coat and hat, and hang them up. Then Perch took the newspaper,\r\nand gave it a turn or two in his hands before the fire, and laid it,\r\ndeferentially, at Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s elbow. And so little objection had Perch\r\nto being deferential in the last degree, that if he might have laid\r\nhimself at Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s feet, or might have called him by some such\r\ntitle as used to be bestowed upon the Caliph Haroun Alraschid, he would\r\nhave been all the better pleased.\r\n\r\nAs this honour would have been an innovation and an experiment, Perch\r\nwas fain to content himself by expressing as well as he could, in his\r\nmanner, You are the light of my Eyes. You are the Breath of my Soul.\r\nYou are the commander of the Faithful Perch! With this imperfect\r\nhappiness to cheer him, he would shut the door softly, walk away on\r\ntiptoe, and leave his great chief to be stared at, through a\r\ndome-shaped window in the leads, by ugly chimney-pots and backs of\r\nhouses, and especially by the bold window of a hair-cutting saloon on a\r\nfirst floor, where a waxen effigy, bald as a Mussulman in the morning,\r\nand covered, after eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the day, with luxuriant hair and\r\nwhiskers in the latest Christian fashion, showed him the wrong side of\r\nits head for ever.\r\n\r\nBetween Mr Dombey and the common world, as it was accessible through\r\nthe medium of the outer office\xe2\x80\x94to which Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s presence in his own\r\nroom may be said to have struck like damp, or cold air\xe2\x80\x94there were two\r\ndegrees of descent. Mr Carker in his own office was the first step; Mr\r\nMorfin, in his own office, was the second. Each of these gentlemen\r\noccupied a little chamber like a bath-room, opening from the passage\r\noutside Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s door. Mr Carker, as Grand Vizier, inhabited the\r\nroom that was nearest to the Sultan. Mr Morfin, as an officer of\r\ninferior state, inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman last mentioned was a cheerful-looking, hazel-eyed elderly\r\nbachelor: gravely attired, as to his upper man, in black; and as to his\r\nlegs, in pepper-and-salt colour. His dark hair was just touched here\r\nand there with specks of gray, as though the tread of Time had splashed\r\nit; and his whiskers were already white. He had a mighty respect for Mr\r\nDombey, and rendered him due homage; but as he was of a genial temper\r\nhimself, and never wholly at his ease in that stately presence, he was\r\ndisquieted by no jealousy of the many conferences enjoyed by Mr Carker,\r\nand felt a secret satisfaction in having duties to discharge, which\r\nrarely exposed him to be singled out for such distinction. He was a\r\ngreat musical amateur in his way\xe2\x80\x94after business; and had a paternal\r\naffection for his violoncello, which was once in every week transported\r\nfrom Islington, his place of abode, to a certain club-room hard by the\r\nBank, where quartettes of the most tormenting and excruciating nature\r\nwere executed every Wednesday evening by a private party.\r\n\r\nMr Carker was a gentleman thirty-eight or forty years old, of a florid\r\ncomplexion, and with two unbroken rows of glistening teeth, whose\r\nregularity and whiteness were quite distressing. It was impossible to\r\nescape the observation of them, for he showed them whenever he spoke;\r\nand bore so wide a smile upon his countenance (a smile, however, very\r\nrarely, indeed, extending beyond his mouth), that there was something\r\nin it like the snarl of a cat. He affected a stiff white cravat, after\r\nthe example of his principal, and was always closely buttoned up and\r\ntightly dressed. His manner towards Mr Dombey was deeply conceived and\r\nperfectly expressed. He was familiar with him, in the very extremity of\r\nhis sense of the distance between them. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey, to a man in your\r\nposition from a man in mine, there is no show of subservience\r\ncompatible with the transaction of business between us, that I should\r\nthink sufficient. I frankly tell you, Sir, I give it up altogether. I\r\nfeel that I could not satisfy my own mind; and Heaven knows, Mr Dombey,\r\nyou can afford to dispense with the endeavour.\xe2\x80\x9d If he had carried these\r\nwords about with him printed on a placard, and had constantly offered\r\nit to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s perusal on the breast of his coat, he could not have\r\nbeen more explicit than he was.\r\n\r\nThis was Carker the Manager. Mr Carker the Junior, Walter\xe2\x80\x99s friend, was\r\nhis brother; two or three years older than he, but widely removed in\r\nstation. The younger brother\xe2\x80\x99s post was on the top of the official\r\nladder; the elder brother\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom. The elder brother never\r\ngained a stave, or raised his foot to mount one. Young men passed above\r\nhis head, and rose and rose; but he was always at the bottom. He was\r\nquite resigned to occupy that low condition: never complained of it:\r\nand certainly never hoped to escape from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker the Manager, entering Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s room soon after his arrival one day: with a bundle of papers\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoolish!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Carker, stirring the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news of the young gentleman who is so important to us all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nCarker, with his whole regiment of teeth on parade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94not direct news\xe2\x80\x94I hear he\xe2\x80\x99s very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. Who had\r\ncome from Brighton over-night. But no one knew It.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, and becoming a great scholar, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nManager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cTime flies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, glancing at his newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! You! You have no reason to think so,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cOne who\r\nsits on such an elevation as yours, and can sit there, unmoved, in all\r\nseasons\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t much reason to know anything about the flight of time.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s men like myself, who are low down and are not superior in\r\ncircumstances, and who inherit new masters in the course of Time, that\r\nhave cause to look about us. I shall have a rising sun to worship,\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime enough, time enough, Carker!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, rising from his\r\nchair, and standing with his back to the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything there\r\nfor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I need trouble you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker, turning over\r\nthe papers in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a committee today at three, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one at three, three-quarters,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch you forgetting anything!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Carker, still turning over\r\nhis papers. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr Paul inherits your memory, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a troublesome\r\ncustomer in the House. One of you is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an accurate memory of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only capital of a man like\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey did not look less pompous or at all displeased, as he stood\r\nleaning against the chimney-piece, surveying his (of course\r\nunconscious) clerk, from head to foot. The stiffness and nicety of Mr\r\nCarker\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and a certain arrogance of manner, either natural to\r\nhim or imitated from a pattern not far off, gave great additional\r\neffect to his humility. He seemed a man who would contend against the\r\npower that vanquished him, if he could, but who was utterly borne down\r\nby the greatness and superiority of Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Morfin here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey after a short pause, during which Mr\r\nCarker had been fluttering his papers, and muttering little abstracts\r\nof their contents to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorfin\xe2\x80\x99s here,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, looking up with his widest and almost\r\nsudden smile; \xe2\x80\x9chumming musical recollections\xe2\x80\x94of his last night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquartette party, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94through the walls between us, and driving me\r\nhalf mad. I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d make a bonfire of his violoncello, and burn his\r\nmusic-books in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou respect nobody, Carker, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Carker, with another wide and most feline show of his\r\nteeth. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Not many people, I believe. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe murmured, as if he were only thinking it, \xe2\x80\x9cfor more than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dangerous quality, if real; and a not less dangerous one, if feigned.\r\nBut Mr Dombey hardly seemed to think so, as he still stood with his\r\nback to the fire, drawn up to his full height, and looking at his\r\nhead-clerk with a dignified composure, in which there seemed to lurk a\r\nstronger latent sense of power than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of Morfin,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr Carker, taking out one paper from the\r\nrest, \xe2\x80\x9che reports a junior dead in the agency at Barbados, and proposes\r\nto reserve a passage in the Son and Heir\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll sail in a month or\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94for the successor. You don\xe2\x80\x99t care who goes, I suppose? We have\r\nnobody of that sort here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey shook his head with supreme indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no very precious appointment,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Carker, taking up a\r\npen, with which to endorse a memorandum on the back of the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhope he may bestow it on some orphan nephew of a musical friend. It may\r\nperhaps stop his fiddle-playing, if he has a gift that way. Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\nCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr Carker. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Walter; appearing with some letters in his hand, unopened, and\r\nnewly arrived. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker the junior, Sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this name, Mr Carker the Manager was or affected to\r\nbe, touched to the quick with shame and humiliation. He cast his eyes\r\nfull on Mr Dombey with an altered and apologetic look, abased them on\r\nthe ground, and remained for a moment without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly and angrily, turning on Walter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you had been before requested not to drag Mr Carker the Junior\r\ninto your conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI was only going to say that Mr\r\nCarker the Junior had told me he believed you were gone out, or I\r\nshould not have knocked at the door when you were engaged with Mr\r\nDombey. These are letters for Mr Dombey, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Carker the Manager, plucking them sharply\r\nfrom his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGo about your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in taking them with so little ceremony, Mr Carker dropped one on\r\nthe floor, and did not see what he had done; neither did Mr Dombey\r\nobserve the letter lying near his feet. Walter hesitated for a moment,\r\nthinking that one or other of them would notice it; but finding that\r\nneither did, he stopped, came back, picked it up, and laid it himself\r\non Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s desk. The letters were post-letters; and it happened\r\nthat the one in question was Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s regular report, directed as\r\nusual\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs Pipchin was but an indifferent penwoman\xe2\x80\x94by Florence. Mr\r\nDombey, having his attention silently called to this letter by Walter,\r\nstarted, and looked fiercely at him, as if he believed that he had\r\npurposely selected it from all the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can leave the room, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, haughtily.\r\n\r\nHe crushed the letter in his hand; and having watched Walter out at the\r\ndoor, put it in his pocket without breaking the seal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese continual references to Mr Carker the Junior,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Carker the\r\nManager began, as soon as they were alone, \xe2\x80\x9care, to a man in my\r\nposition, uttered before one in yours, so unspeakably distressing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are too sensitive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sensitive,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one in your position could by any\r\npossibility imagine yourself in my place: which you cannot: you would\r\nbe so too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were evidently pursuing some other subject, his\r\ndiscreet ally broke off here, and stood with his teeth ready to present\r\nto him, when he should look up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want somebody to send to the West Indies, you were saying,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Mr Dombey, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend young Gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, very good indeed. Nothing easier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, without any\r\nshow of surprise, and taking up the pen to re-endorse the letter, as\r\ncoolly as he had done before. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Send young Gay.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nMr Carker was quick to do so, and Walter was quick to return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, turning a little to look at him over his\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn opening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with his mouth stretched to the utmost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the West Indies. At Barbados. I am going to send you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey, scorning to embellish the bare truth, \xe2\x80\x9cto fill a junior\r\nsituation in the counting-house at Barbados. Let your Uncle know from\r\nme, that I have chosen you to go to the West Indies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s breath was so completely taken away by his astonishment, that\r\nhe could hardly find enough for the repetition of the words \xe2\x80\x9cWest\r\nIndies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are young and healthy, and\r\nyour Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances are not good. Tell your Uncle that you are\r\nappointed. You will not go yet. There will be an interval of a month\xe2\x80\x94or\r\ntwo perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I remain there, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you remain there, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Dombey, turning a little more\r\nround towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? What does he mean, Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive there, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nWalter bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, resuming his letters. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will explain\r\nto him in good time about the usual outfit and so forth, Carker, of\r\ncourse. He needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, Gay,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Carker: bare to the gums.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, stopping in his reading without looking off\r\nthe letter, and seeming to listen. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless he has anything to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, agitated and confused, and almost stunned,\r\nas an infinite variety of pictures presented themselves to his mind;\r\namong which Captain Cuttle, in his glazed hat, transfixed with\r\nastonishment at Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s, and his uncle bemoaning his loss in\r\nthe little back parlour, held prominent places. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nmuch obliged, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nAnd as Mr Carker again echoed the words, and also collected his papers\r\nas if he were going away too, Walter felt that his lingering any longer\r\nwould be an unpardonable intrusion\xe2\x80\x94especially as he had nothing to\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94and therefore walked out quite confounded.\r\n\r\nGoing along the passage, with the mingled consciousness and\r\nhelplessness of a dream, he heard Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s door shut again, as Mr\r\nCarker came out: and immediately afterwards that gentleman called to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring your friend Mr Carker the Junior to my room, Sir, if you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter went to the outer office and apprised Mr Carker the Junior of\r\nhis errand, who accordingly came out from behind a partition where he\r\nsat alone in one corner, and returned with him to the room of Mr Carker\r\nthe Manager.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was standing with his back to the fire, and his hands\r\nunder his coat-tails, looking over his white cravat, as unpromisingly\r\nas Mr Dombey himself could have looked. He received them without any\r\nchange in his attitude or softening of his harsh and black expression:\r\nmerely signing to Walter to close the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, when this was done, turning suddenly\r\nupon his brother, with his two rows of teeth bristling as if he would\r\nhave bitten him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the league between you and this young man, in\r\nvirtue of which I am haunted and hunted by the mention of your name? Is\r\nit not enough for you, John Carker, that I am your near relation, and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t detach myself from that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay disgrace, James,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the other in a low voice, finding\r\nthat he stammered for a word. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it, and have reason, say\r\ndisgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that disgrace,\xe2\x80\x9d assented his brother with keen emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut is\r\nthe fact to be blurted out and trumpeted, and proclaimed continually in\r\nthe presence of the very House! In moments of confidence too? Do you\r\nthink your name is calculated to harmonise in this place with trust and\r\nconfidence, John Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, James. God knows I have no such\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your thought, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cand why do you thrust\r\nyourself in my way? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you injured me enough already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never injured you, James, wilfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s injury enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could undo it, James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could and would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, Walter had looked from one brother to the\r\nother, with pain and amazement. He who was the Senior in years, and\r\nJunior in the House, stood, with his eyes cast upon the ground, and his\r\nhead bowed, humbly listening to the reproaches of the other. Though\r\nthese were rendered very bitter by the tone and look with which they\r\nwere accompanied, and by the presence of Walter whom they so much\r\nsurprised and shocked, he entered no other protest against them than by\r\nslightly raising his right hand in a deprecatory manner, as if he would\r\nhave said, \xe2\x80\x9cSpare me!\xe2\x80\x9d So, had they been blows, and he a brave man,\r\nunder strong constraint, and weakened by bodily suffering, he might\r\nhave stood before the executioner.\r\n\r\nGenerous and quick in all his emotions, and regarding himself as the\r\ninnocent occasion of these taunts, Walter now struck in, with all the\r\nearnestness he felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing himself to the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\r\nindeed, this is my fault solely. In a kind of heedlessness, for which I\r\ncannot blame myself enough, I have, I have no doubt, mentioned Mr\r\nCarker the Junior much oftener than was necessary; and have allowed his\r\nname sometimes to slip through my lips, when it was against your\r\nexpressed wish. But it has been my own mistake, Sir. We have never\r\nexchanged one word upon the subject\xe2\x80\x94very few, indeed, on any subject.\r\nAnd it has not been,\xe2\x80\x9d added Walter, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, \xe2\x80\x9call\r\nheedlessness on my part, Sir; for I have felt an interest in Mr Carker\r\never since I have been here, and have hardly been able to help speaking\r\nof him sometimes, when I have thought of him so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter said this from his soul, and with the very breath of honour. For\r\nhe looked upon the bowed head, and the downcast eyes, and upraised\r\nhand, and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have felt it; and why should I not avow it in\r\nbehalf of this unfriended, broken man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager looked at him, as he spoke, and when he had\r\nfinished speaking, with a smile that seemed to divide his face into two\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an excitable youth, Gay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand should endeavour to\r\ncool down a little now, for it would be unwise to encourage feverish\r\npredispositions. Be as cool as you can, Gay. Be as cool as you can. You\r\nmight have asked Mr John Carker himself (if you have not done so)\r\nwhether he claims to be, or is, an object of such strong interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames, do me justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cI have claimed nothing; and\r\nI claim nothing. Believe me, on my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonour?\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother, with another smile, as he warmed himself\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my Me\xe2\x80\x94on my fallen life!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, in the same low\r\nvoice, but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed\r\ncapable of giving them. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, I have held myself aloof, and kept\r\nalone. This has been unsought by me. I have avoided him and everyone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, you have avoided me, Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, with the tears\r\nrising to his eyes; so true was his compassion. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it, to my\r\ndisappointment and regret. When I first came here, and ever since, I am\r\nsure I have tried to be as much your friend, as one of my age could\r\npresume to be; but it has been of no use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd observe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, taking him up quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be of\r\nstill less use, Gay, if you persist in forcing Mr John Carker\xe2\x80\x99s name on\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s attention. That is not the way to befriend Mr John Carker. Ask\r\nhim if he thinks it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no service to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brother. \xe2\x80\x9cIt only leads to such a\r\nconversation as the present, which I need not say I could have well\r\nspared. No one can be a better friend to me:\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke here very\r\ndistinctly, as if he would impress it upon Walter: \xe2\x80\x9cthan in forgetting\r\nme, and leaving me to go my way, unquestioned and unnoticed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour memory not being retentive, Gay, of what you are told by others,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Carker the Manager, warming himself with great and increased\r\nsatisfaction, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it well that you should be told this from the\r\nbest authority,\xe2\x80\x9d nodding towards his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not likely to\r\nforget it now, I hope. That\xe2\x80\x99s all, Gay. You can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter passed out at the door, and was about to close it after him,\r\nwhen, hearing the voices of the brothers again, and also the mention of\r\nhis own name, he stood irresolutely, with his hand upon the lock, and\r\nthe door ajar, uncertain whether to return or go away. In this position\r\nhe could not help overhearing what followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of me more leniently, if you can, James,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I tell you I have had\xe2\x80\x94how could I help having, with my history,\r\nwritten here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94striking himself upon the breast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy whole heart awakened\r\nby my observation of that boy, Walter Gay. I saw in him when he first\r\ncame here, almost my other self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour other self!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Manager, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as I am, but as I was when I first came here too; as sanguine,\r\ngiddy, youthful, inexperienced; flushed with the same restless and\r\nadventurous fancies; and full of the same qualities, fraught with the\r\nsame capacity of leading on to good or evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother, with some hidden and sarcastic meaning\r\nin his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou strike me sharply; and your hand is steady, and your thrust is\r\nvery deep,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, speaking (or so Walter thought) as if\r\nsome cruel weapon actually stabbed him as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagined all\r\nthis when he was a boy. I believed it. It was a truth to me. I saw him\r\nlightly walking on the edge of an unseen gulf where so many others walk\r\nwith equal gaiety, and from which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted his brother, as he stirred the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nmany. Go on. Say, so many fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom which ONE traveller fell,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwho set forward,\r\non his way, a boy like him, and missed his footing more and more, and\r\nslipped a little and a little lower; and went on stumbling still, until\r\nhe fell headlong and found himself below a shattered man. Think what I\r\nsuffered, when I watched that boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only yourself to thank for it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t seek to divide the\r\nblame or shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have divided the shame,\xe2\x80\x9d James Carker muttered through his teeth.\r\nAnd, through so many and such close teeth, he could mutter well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, James,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his brother, speaking for the first time in an\r\naccent of reproach, and seeming, by the sound of his voice, to have\r\ncovered his face with his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been, since then, a useful\r\nfoil to you. You have trodden on me freely in your climbing up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspurn me with your heel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. After a time, Mr Carker the Manager was heard\r\nrustling among his papers, as if he had resolved to bring the interview\r\nto a conclusion. At the same time his brother withdrew nearer to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched him with such trembling and such\r\nfear, as was some little punishment to me, until he passed the place\r\nwhere I first fell; and then, though I had been his father, I believe I\r\nnever could have thanked God more devoutly. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to warn him,\r\nand advise him; but if I had seen direct cause, I would have shown him\r\nmy example. I was afraid to be seen speaking with him, lest it should\r\nbe thought I did him harm, and tempted him to evil, and corrupted him:\r\nor lest I really should. There may be such contagion in me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. Piece out my history, in connexion with young Walter Gay, and\r\nwhat he has made me feel; and think of me more leniently, James, if you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words he came out to where Walter was standing. He turned a\r\nlittle paler when he saw him there, and paler yet when Walter caught\r\nhim by the hand, and said in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker, pray let me thank you! Let me say how much I feel for you!\r\nHow sorry I am, to have been the unhappy cause of all this! How I\r\nalmost look upon you now as my protector and guardian! How very, very\r\nmuch, I feel obliged to you and pity you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, squeezing both\r\nhis hands, and hardly knowing, in his agitation, what he did or said.\r\n\r\nMr Morfin\xe2\x80\x99s room being close at hand and empty, and the door wide open,\r\nthey moved thither by one accord: the passage being seldom free from\r\nsomeone passing to or fro. When they were there, and Walter saw in Mr\r\nCarker\xe2\x80\x99s face some traces of the emotion within, he almost felt as if\r\nhe had never seen the face before; it was so greatly changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his hand on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI am far removed\r\nfrom you, and may I ever be. Do you know what I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are!\xe2\x80\x9d appeared to hang on Walter\xe2\x80\x99s lips, as he regarded him\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was begun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore my twenty-first birthday\xe2\x80\x94led up\r\nto, long before, but not begun till near that time. I had robbed them\r\nwhen I came of age. I robbed them afterwards. Before my twenty-second\r\nbirthday, it was all found out; and then, Walter, from all men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety, I died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain his last few words hung trembling upon Walter\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but he\r\ncould neither utter them, nor any of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe House was very good to me. May Heaven reward the old man for his\r\nforbearance! This one, too, his son, who was then newly in the Firm,\r\nwhere I had held great trust! I was called into that room which is now\r\nhis\xe2\x80\x94I have never entered it since\xe2\x80\x94and came out, what you know me. For\r\nmany years I sat in my present seat, alone as now, but then a known and\r\nrecognised example to the rest. They were all merciful to me, and I\r\nlived. Time has altered that part of my poor expiation; and I think,\r\nexcept the three heads of the House, there is no one here who knows my\r\nstory rightly. Before the little boy grows up, and has it told to him,\r\nmy corner may be vacant. I would rather that it might be so! This is\r\nthe only change to me since that day, when I left all youth, and hope,\r\nand good men\xe2\x80\x99s company, behind me in that room. God bless you, Walter!\r\nKeep you, and all dear to you, in honesty, or strike them dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome recollection of his trembling from head to foot, as if with\r\nexcessive cold, and of his bursting into tears, was all that Walter\r\ncould add to this, when he tried to recall exactly what had passed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nWhen Walter saw him next, he was bending over his desk in his old\r\nsilent, drooping, humbled way. Then, observing him at his work, and\r\nfeeling how resolved he evidently was that no further intercourse\r\nshould arise between them, and thinking again and again on all he had\r\nseen and heard that morning in so short a time, in connexion with the\r\nhistory of both the Carkers, Walter could hardly believe that he was\r\nunder orders for the West Indies, and would soon be lost to Uncle Sol,\r\nand Captain Cuttle, and to glimpses few and far between of Florence\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x94no, he meant Paul\xe2\x80\x94and to all he loved, and liked, and looked\r\nfor, in his daily life.\r\n\r\nBut it was true, and the news had already penetrated to the outer\r\noffice; for while he sat with a heavy heart, pondering on these things,\r\nand resting his head upon his arm, Perch the messenger, descending from\r\nhis mahogany bracket, and jogging his elbow, begged his pardon, but\r\nwished to say in his ear, Did he think he could arrange to send home to\r\nEngland a jar of preserved Ginger, cheap, for Mrs Perch\xe2\x80\x99s own eating,\r\nin the course of her recovery from her next confinement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nPaul grows more and more Old-fashioned, and goes Home for the Holidays\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Midsummer vacation approached, no indecent manifestations of\r\njoy were exhibited by the leaden-eyed young gentlemen assembled at\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s. Any such violent expression as \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking up,\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nhave been quite inapplicable to that polite establishment. The young\r\ngentlemen oozed away, semi-annually, to their own homes; but they never\r\nbroke up. They would have scorned the action.\r\n\r\nTozer, who was constantly galled and tormented by a starched white\r\ncambric neckerchief, which he wore at the express desire of Mrs Tozer,\r\nhis parent, who, designing him for the Church, was of opinion that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in that forward state of preparation too soon\xe2\x80\x94Tozer said,\r\nindeed, that choosing between two evils, he thought he would rather\r\nstay where he was, than go home. However inconsistent this declaration\r\nmight appear with that passage in Tozer\xe2\x80\x99s Essay on the subject, wherein\r\nhe had observed \xe2\x80\x9cthat the thoughts of home and all its recollections,\r\nawakened in his mind the most pleasing emotions of anticipation and\r\ndelight,\xe2\x80\x9d and had also likened himself to a Roman General, flushed with\r\na recent victory over the Iceni, or laden with Carthaginian spoil,\r\nadvancing within a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 march of the Capitol, presupposed, for\r\nthe purposes of the simile, to be the dwelling-place of Mrs Tozer,\r\nstill it was very sincerely made. For it seemed that Tozer had a\r\ndreadful Uncle, who not only volunteered examinations of him, in the\r\nholidays, on abstruse points, but twisted innocent events and things,\r\nand wrenched them to the same fell purpose. So that if this Uncle took\r\nhim to the Play, or, on a similar pretence of kindness, carried him to\r\nsee a Giant, or a Dwarf, or a Conjuror, or anything, Tozer knew he had\r\nread up some classical allusion to the subject beforehand, and was\r\nthrown into a state of mortal apprehension: not foreseeing where he\r\nmight break out, or what authority he might not quote against him.\r\n\r\nAs to Briggs, his father made no show of artifice about it. He never\r\nwould leave him alone. So numerous and severe were the mental trials of\r\nthat unfortunate youth in vacation time, that the friends of the family\r\n(then resident near Bayswater, London) seldom approached the ornamental\r\npiece of water in Kensington Gardens, without a vague expectation of\r\nseeing Master Briggs\xe2\x80\x99s hat floating on the surface, and an unfinished\r\nexercise lying on the bank. Briggs, therefore, was not at all sanguine\r\non the subject of holidays; and these two sharers of little Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom were so fair a sample of the young gentlemen in general, that\r\nthe most elastic among them contemplated the arrival of those festive\r\nperiods with genteel resignation.\r\n\r\nIt was far otherwise with little Paul. The end of these first holidays\r\nwas to witness his separation from Florence, but who ever looked\r\nforward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come! Not\r\nPaul, assuredly. As the happy time drew near, the lions and tigers\r\nclimbing up the bedroom walls became quite tame and frolicsome. The\r\ngrim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth, relaxed\r\nand peeped out at him with less wicked eyes. The grave old clock had\r\nmore of personal interest in the tone of its formal inquiry; and the\r\nrestless sea went rolling on all night, to the sounding of a melancholy\r\nstrain\xe2\x80\x94yet it was pleasant too\xe2\x80\x94that rose and fell with the waves, and\r\nrocked him, as it were, to sleep.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder, B.A., seemed to think that he, too, would enjoy the holidays\r\nvery much. Mr Toots projected a life of holidays from that time forth;\r\nfor, as he regularly informed Paul every day, it was his \xe2\x80\x9clast half\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, and he was going to begin to come into his property\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly understood between Paul and Mr Toots, that they were\r\nintimate friends, notwithstanding their distance in point of years and\r\nstation. As the vacation approached, and Mr Toots breathed harder and\r\nstared oftener in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s society, than he had done before, Paul knew\r\nthat he meant he was sorry they were going to lose sight of each other,\r\nand felt very much obliged to him for his patronage and good opinion.\r\n\r\nIt was even understood by Doctor Blimber, Mrs Blimber, and Miss\r\nBlimber, as well as by the young gentlemen in general, that Toots had\r\nsomehow constituted himself protector and guardian of Dombey, and the\r\ncircumstance became so notorious, even to Mrs Pipchin, that the good\r\nold creature cherished feelings of bitterness and jealousy against\r\nToots; and, in the sanctuary of her own home, repeatedly denounced him\r\nas a \xe2\x80\x9cchuckle-headed noodle.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereas the innocent Toots had no more\r\nidea of awakening Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s wrath, than he had of any other\r\ndefinite possibility or proposition. On the contrary, he was disposed\r\nto consider her rather a remarkable character, with many points of\r\ninterest about her. For this reason he smiled on her with so much\r\nurbanity, and asked her how she did, so often, in the course of her\r\nvisits to little Paul, that at last she one night told him plainly, she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to it, whatever he might think; and she could not, and she\r\nwould not bear it, either from himself or any other puppy then\r\nexisting: at which unexpected acknowledgment of his civilities, Mr\r\nToots was so alarmed that he secreted himself in a retired spot until\r\nshe had gone. Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin, under\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s roof.\r\n\r\nThey were within two or three weeks of the holidays, when, one day,\r\nCornelia Blimber called Paul into her room, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDombey, I am\r\ngoing to send home your analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I mean, do you, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miss Blimber, looking\r\nhard at him, through the spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to be afraid you are a\r\nsad boy. When you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the meaning of an expression, why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou seek for information?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin told me I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to ask questions,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you not to mention Mrs Pipchin to me, on any account,\r\nDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of allowing it. The\r\ncourse of study here, is very far removed from anything of that sort. A\r\nrepetition of such allusions would make it necessary for me to request\r\nto hear, without a mistake, before breakfast-time to-morrow morning,\r\nfrom Verbum personale down to simillimia cygno.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began little Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must trouble you not to tell me that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean, if you please,\r\nDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, who preserved an awful politeness in her\r\nadmonitions. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a line of argument I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of\r\npermitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul felt it safest to say nothing at all, so he only looked at Miss\r\nBlimber\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles. Miss Blimber having shaken her head at him\r\ngravely, referred to a paper lying before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Analysis of the character of P. Dombey.\xe2\x80\x99 If my recollection serves\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber breaking off, \xe2\x80\x9cthe word analysis as opposed to\r\nsynthesis, is thus defined by Walker. \xe2\x80\x98The resolution of an object,\r\nwhether of the senses or of the intellect, into its first elements.\xe2\x80\x99 As\r\nopposed to synthesis, you observe. Now you know what analysis is,\r\nDombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDombey didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be absolutely blinded by the light let in upon\r\nhis intellect, but he made Miss Blimber a little bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Analysis,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miss Blimber, casting her eye over the paper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98of the character of P. Dombey.\xe2\x80\x99 I find that the natural capacity of\r\nDombey is extremely good; and that his general disposition to study may\r\nbe stated in an equal ratio. Thus, taking eight as our standard and\r\nhighest number, I find these qualities in Dombey stated each at six\r\nthree-fourths!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber paused to see how Paul received this news. Being undecided\r\nwhether six three-fourths meant six pounds fifteen, or sixpence three\r\nfarthings, or six foot three, or three quarters past six, or six\r\nsomethings that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learnt yet, with three unknown something\r\nelses over, Paul rubbed his hands and looked straight at Miss Blimber.\r\nIt happened to answer as well as anything else he could have done; and\r\nCornelia proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Violence two. Selfishness two. Inclination to low company, as evinced\r\nin the case of a person named Glubb, originally seven, but since\r\nreduced. Gentlemanly demeanour four, and improving with advancing\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x99 Now what I particularly wish to call your attention to, Dombey,\r\nis the general observation at the close of this analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul set himself to follow it with great care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It may be generally observed of Dombey,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, reading\r\nin a loud voice, and at every second word directing her spectacles\r\ntowards the little figure before her: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98that his abilities and\r\ninclinations are good, and that he has made as much progress as under\r\nthe circumstances could have been expected. But it is to be lamented of\r\nthis young gentleman that he is singular (what is usually termed\r\nold-fashioned) in his character and conduct, and that, without\r\npresenting anything in either which distinctly calls for reprobation,\r\nhe is often very unlike other young gentlemen of his age and social\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x99 Now, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Blimber, laying down the paper, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis analysis, you see, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Blimber continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis going to\r\nbe sent home to your respected parent. It will naturally be very\r\npainful to him to find that you are singular in your character and\r\nconduct. It is naturally painful to us; for we can\xe2\x80\x99t like you, you\r\nknow, Dombey, as well as we could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe touched the child upon a tender point. He had secretly become more\r\nand more solicitous from day to day, as the time of his departure drew\r\nmore near, that all the house should like him. From some hidden reason,\r\nvery imperfectly understood by himself\xe2\x80\x94if understood at all\xe2\x80\x94he felt a\r\ngradually increasing impulse of affection, towards almost everything\r\nand everybody in the place. He could not bear to think that they would\r\nbe quite indifferent to him when he was gone. He wanted them to\r\nremember him kindly; and he had made it his business even to conciliate\r\na great hoarse shaggy dog, chained up at the back of the house, who had\r\npreviously been the terror of his life: that even he might miss him\r\nwhen he was no longer there.\r\n\r\nLittle thinking that in this, he only showed again the difference\r\nbetween himself and his compeers, poor tiny Paul set it forth to Miss\r\nBlimber as well as he could, and begged her, in despite of the official\r\nanalysis, to have the goodness to try and like him. To Mrs Blimber, who\r\nhad joined them, he preferred the same petition: and when that lady\r\ncould not forbear, even in his presence, from giving utterance to her\r\noften-repeated opinion, that he was an odd child, Paul told her that he\r\nwas sure she was quite right; that he thought it must be his bones, but\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; and that he hoped she would overlook it, for he was\r\nfond of them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so fond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, with a mixture of timidity and perfect\r\nfrankness, which was one of the most peculiar and most engaging\r\nqualities of the child, \xe2\x80\x9cnot so fond as I am of Florence, of course;\r\nthat could never be. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that, could you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the old-fashioned little soul!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Blimber, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like everybody here very much,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should\r\ngrieve to go away, and think that anyone was glad that I was gone, or\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber was now quite sure that Paul was the oddest child in the\r\nworld; and when she told the Doctor what had passed, the Doctor did not\r\ncontrovert his wife\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. But he said, as he had said before, when\r\nPaul first came, that study would do much; and he also said, as he had\r\nsaid on that occasion, \xe2\x80\x9cBring him on, Cornelia! Bring him on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornelia had always brought him on as vigorously as she could; and Paul\r\nhad had a hard life of it. But over and above the getting through his\r\ntasks, he had long had another purpose always present to him, and to\r\nwhich he still held fast. It was, to be a gentle, useful, quiet little\r\nfellow, always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest;\r\nand though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs,\r\nor watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window, he was\r\noftener found, too, among the other boys, modestly rendering them some\r\nlittle voluntary service. Thus it came to pass, that even among those\r\nrigid and absorbed young anchorites, who mortified themselves beneath\r\nthe roof of Doctor Blimber, Paul was an object of general interest; a\r\nfragile little plaything that they all liked, and that no one would\r\nhave thought of treating roughly. But he could not change his nature,\r\nor rewrite the analysis; and so they all agreed that Dombey was\r\nold-fashioned.\r\n\r\nThere were some immunities, however, attaching to the character enjoyed\r\nby no one else. They could have better spared a newer-fashioned child,\r\nand that alone was much. When the others only bowed to Doctor Blimber\r\nand family on retiring for the night, Paul would stretch out his morsel\r\nof a hand, and boldly shake the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s; also Mrs Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s; also\r\nCornelia\xe2\x80\x99s. If anybody was to be begged off from impending punishment,\r\nPaul was always the delegate. The weak-eyed young man himself had once\r\nconsulted him, in reference to a little breakage of glass and china.\r\nAnd it was darkly rumoured that the butler, regarding him with favour\r\nsuch as that stern man had never shown before to mortal boy, had\r\nsometimes mingled porter with his table-beer to make him strong.\r\n\r\nOver and above these extensive privileges, Paul had free right of entry\r\nto Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s room, from which apartment he had twice led Mr Toots\r\ninto the open air in a state of faintness, consequent on an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to smoke a very blunt cigar: one of a bundle which\r\nthat young gentleman had covertly purchased on the shingle from a most\r\ndesperate smuggler, who had acknowledged, in confidence, that two\r\nhundred pounds was the price set upon his head, dead or alive, by the\r\nCustom House. It was a snug room, Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s, with his bed in another\r\nlittle room inside of it; and a flute, which Mr Feeder couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play\r\nyet, but was going to make a point of learning, he said, hanging up\r\nover the fireplace. There were some books in it, too, and a\r\nfishing-rod; for Mr Feeder said he should certainly make a point of\r\nlearning to fish, when he could find time. Mr Feeder had amassed, with\r\nsimilar intentions, a beautiful little curly secondhand key-bugle, a\r\nchess-board and men, a Spanish Grammar, a set of sketching materials,\r\nand a pair of boxing-gloves. The art of self-defence Mr Feeder said he\r\nshould undoubtedly make a point of learning, as he considered it the\r\nduty of every man to do; for it might lead to the protection of a\r\nfemale in distress.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s great possession was a large green jar of snuff, which\r\nMr Toots had brought down as a present, at the close of the last\r\nvacation; and for which he had paid a high price, having been the\r\ngenuine property of the Prince Regent. Neither Mr Toots nor Mr Feeder\r\ncould partake of this or any other snuff, even in the most stinted and\r\nmoderate degree, without being seized with convulsions of sneezing.\r\nNevertheless it was their great delight to moisten a box-full with cold\r\ntea, stir it up on a piece of parchment with a paper-knife, and devote\r\nthemselves to its consumption then and there. In the course of which\r\ncramming of their noses, they endured surprising torments with the\r\nconstancy of martyrs: and, drinking table-beer at intervals, felt all\r\nthe glories of dissipation.\r\n\r\nTo little Paul sitting silent in their company, and by the side of his\r\nchief patron, Mr Toots, there was a dread charm in these reckless\r\noccasions: and when Mr Feeder spoke of the dark mysteries of London,\r\nand told Mr Toots that he was going to observe it himself closely in\r\nall its ramifications in the approaching holidays, and for that purpose\r\nhad made arrangements to board with two old maiden ladies at Peckham,\r\nPaul regarded him as if he were the hero of some book of travels or\r\nwild adventure, and was almost afraid of such a slashing person.\r\n\r\nGoing into this room one evening, when the holidays were very near,\r\nPaul found Mr Feeder filling up the blanks in some printed letters,\r\nwhile some others, already filled up and strewn before him, were being\r\nfolded and sealed by Mr Toots. Mr Feeder said, \xe2\x80\x9cAha, Dombey, there you\r\nare, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for they were always kind to him, and glad to see\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and then said, tossing one of the letters towards him, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\r\nyou are, too, Dombey. That\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\nPaul, looking at it, found, in copper-plate print, with the exception\r\nof his own name and the date, which were in Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s penmanship,\r\nthat Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr P. Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth Instant;\r\nand that the hour was half-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and that the object was\r\nQuadrilles. Mr Toots also showed him, by holding up a companion sheet\r\nof paper, that Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr\r\nToots\xe2\x80\x99s company at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth\r\nInstant, when the hour was half-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and when the object\r\nwas Quadrilles. He also found, on glancing at the table where Mr Feeder\r\nsat, that the pleasure of Mr Briggs\xe2\x80\x99s company, and of Mr Tozer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, and of every young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s company, was requested by\r\nDoctor and Mrs Blimber on the same genteel Occasion.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder then told him, to his great joy, that his sister was invited,\r\nand that it was a half-yearly event, and that, as the holidays began\r\nthat day, he could go away with his sister after the party, if he\r\nliked, which Paul interrupted him to say he would like, very much. Mr\r\nFeeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform\r\nDoctor and Mrs Blimber, in superfine small-hand, that Mr P. Dombey\r\nwould be happy to have the honour of waiting on them, in accordance\r\nwith their polite invitation. Lastly, Mr Feeder said, he had better not\r\nrefer to the festive occasion, in the hearing of Doctor and Mrs\r\nBlimber; as these preliminaries, and the whole of the arrangements,\r\nwere conducted on principles of classicality and high breeding; and\r\nthat Doctor and Mrs Blimber on the one hand, and the young gentlemen on\r\nthe other, were supposed, in their scholastic capacities, not to have\r\nthe least idea of what was in the wind.\r\n\r\nPaul thanked Mr Feeder for these hints, and pocketing his invitation,\r\nsat down on a stool by the side of Mr Toots, as usual. But Paul\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nwhich had long been ailing more or less, and was sometimes very heavy\r\nand painful, felt so uneasy that night, that he was obliged to support\r\nit on his hand. And yet it dropped so, that by little and little it\r\nsunk on Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and rested there, as if it had no care to be\r\never lifted up again.\r\n\r\nThat was no reason why he should be deaf; but he must have been, he\r\nthought, for, by and by, he heard Mr Feeder calling in his ear, and\r\ngently shaking him to rouse his attention. And when he raised his head,\r\nquite scared, and looked about him, he found that Doctor Blimber had\r\ncome into the room; and that the window was open, and that his forehead\r\nwas wet with sprinkled water; though how all this had been done without\r\nhis knowledge, was very curious indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Come, come! That\xe2\x80\x99s well! How is my little friend now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor\r\nBlimber, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite well, thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be something the matter with the floor, for he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand upon it steadily; and with the walls too, for they were\r\ninclined to turn round and round, and could only be stopped by being\r\nlooked at very hard indeed. Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s head had the appearance of being\r\nat once bigger and farther off than was quite natural; and when he took\r\nPaul in his arms, to carry him upstairs, Paul observed with\r\nastonishment that the door was in quite a different place from that in\r\nwhich he had expected to find it, and almost thought, at first, that Mr\r\nToots was going to walk straight up the chimney.\r\n\r\nIt was very kind of Mr Toots to carry him to the top of the house so\r\ntenderly; and Paul told him that it was. But Mr Toots said he would do\r\na great deal more than that, if he could; and indeed he did more as it\r\nwas: for he helped Paul to undress, and helped him to bed, in the\r\nkindest manner possible, and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled\r\nvery much; while Mr Feeder, B.A., leaning over the bottom of the\r\nbedstead, set all the little bristles on his head bolt upright with his\r\nbony hands, and then made believe to spar at Paul with great science,\r\non account of his being all right again, which was so uncommonly\r\nfacetious, and kind too in Mr Feeder, that Paul, not being able to make\r\nup his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him, did both at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nHow Mr Toots melted away, and Mr Feeder changed into Mrs Pipchin, Paul\r\nnever thought of asking; neither was he at all curious to know; but\r\nwhen he saw Mrs Pipchin standing at the bottom of the bed, instead of\r\nMr Feeder, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs Pipchin, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell Florence what, my little Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, coming\r\nround to the bedside, and sitting down in the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think I mean to do when I grow up, Mrs Pipchin?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nPaul, turning his face towards her on his pillow, and resting his chin\r\nwistfully on his folded hands.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cto put my money all together in one Bank, never\r\ntry to get any more, go away into the country with my darling Florence,\r\nhave a beautiful garden, fields, and woods, and live there with her all\r\nmy life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean to do, when I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and\r\npondered for a moment.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s grey eye scanned his thoughtful face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I grow up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. Then he went on immediately to tell Mrs\r\nPipchin all about the party, about Florence\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, about the\r\npride he would have in the admiration that would be felt for her by all\r\nthe boys, about their being so kind to him and fond of him, about his\r\nbeing so fond of them, and about his being so glad of it. Then he told\r\nMrs Pipchin about the analysis, and about his being certainly\r\nold-fashioned, and took Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on that point, and\r\nwhether she knew why it was, and what it meant. Mrs Pipchin denied the\r\nfact altogether, as the shortest way of getting out of the difficulty;\r\nbut Paul was far from satisfied with that reply, and looked so\r\nsearchingly at Mrs Pipchin for a truer answer, that she was obliged to\r\nget up and look out of the window to avoid his eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain calm Apothecary, who attended at the establishment\r\nwhen any of the young gentlemen were ill, and somehow he got into the\r\nroom and appeared at the bedside, with Mrs Blimber. How they came\r\nthere, or how long they had been there, Paul didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; but when he\r\nsaw them, he sat up in bed, and answered all the Apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s questions\r\nat full length, and whispered to him that Florence was not to know\r\nanything about it, if he pleased, and that he had set his mind upon her\r\ncoming to the party. He was very chatty with the Apothecary, and they\r\nparted excellent friends. Lying down again with his eyes shut, he heard\r\nthe Apothecary say, out of the room and quite a long way off\xe2\x80\x94or he\r\ndreamed it\xe2\x80\x94that there was a want of vital power (what was that, Paul\r\nwondered!) and great constitutional weakness. That as the little fellow\r\nhad set his heart on parting with his school-mates on the seventeenth,\r\nit would be better to indulge the fancy if he grew no worse. That he\r\nwas glad to hear from Mrs Pipchin, that the little fellow would go to\r\nhis friends in London on the eighteenth. That he would write to Mr\r\nDombey, when he should have gained a better knowledge of the case, and\r\nbefore that day. That there was no immediate cause for\xe2\x80\x94what? Paul lost\r\nthat word. And that the little fellow had a fine mind, but was an\r\nold-fashioned boy.\r\n\r\nWhat old fashion could that be, Paul wondered with a palpitating heart,\r\nthat was so visibly expressed in him; so plainly seen by so many\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nHe could neither make it out, nor trouble himself long with the effort.\r\nMrs Pipchin was again beside him, if she had ever been away (he thought\r\nshe had gone out with the Doctor, but it was all a dream perhaps), and\r\npresently a bottle and glass got into her hands magically, and she\r\npoured out the contents for him. After that, he had some real good\r\njelly, which Mrs Blimber brought to him herself; and then he was so\r\nwell, that Mrs Pipchin went home, at his urgent solicitation, and\r\nBriggs and Tozer came to bed. Poor Briggs grumbled terribly about his\r\nown analysis, which could hardly have discomposed him more if it had\r\nbeen a chemical process; but he was very good to Paul, and so was\r\nTozer, and so were all the rest, for they every one looked in before\r\ngoing to bed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you now, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, little\r\nDombey!\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth. After Briggs had got into bed, he lay awake for\r\na long time, still bemoaning his analysis, and saying he knew it was\r\nall wrong, and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have analysed a murderer worse, and\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nwould Doctor Blimber like it if his pocket-money depended on it? It was\r\nvery easy, Briggs said, to make a galley-slave of a boy all the\r\nhalf-year, and then score him up idle; and to crib two dinners a-week\r\nout of his board, and then score him up greedy; but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going\r\nto be submitted to, he believed, was it? Oh! Ah!\r\n\r\nBefore the weak-eyed young man performed on the gong next morning, he\r\ncame upstairs to Paul and told him he was to lie still, which Paul very\r\ngladly did. Mrs Pipchin reappeared a little before the Apothecary, and\r\na little after the good young woman whom Paul had seen cleaning the\r\nstove on that first morning (how long ago it seemed now!) had brought\r\nhim his breakfast. There was another consultation a long way off, or\r\nelse Paul dreamed it again; and then the Apothecary, coming back with\r\nDoctor and Mrs Blimber, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think, Doctor Blimber, we may release this young gentleman from\r\nhis books just now; the vacation being so very near at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cMy love, you will inform\r\nCornelia, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Blimber.\r\n\r\nThe Apothecary bending down, looked closely into Paul\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and felt\r\nhis head, and his pulse, and his heart, with so much interest and care,\r\nthat Paul said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur little friend,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Doctor Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9chas never complained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Apothecary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was not likely to complain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find him greatly better?\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he is greatly better, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Apothecary.\r\n\r\nPaul had begun to speculate, in his own odd way, on the subject that\r\nmight occupy the Apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s mind just at that moment; so musingly had\r\nhe answered the two questions of Doctor Blimber. But the Apothecary\r\nhappening to meet his little patient\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as the latter set off on\r\nthat mental expedition, and coming instantly out of his abstraction\r\nwith a cheerful smile, Paul smiled in return and abandoned it.\r\n\r\nHe lay in bed all that day, dozing and dreaming, and looking at Mr\r\nToots; but got up on the next, and went downstairs. Lo and behold,\r\nthere was something the matter with the great clock; and a workman on a\r\npair of steps had taken its face off, and was poking instruments into\r\nthe works by the light of a candle! This was a great event for Paul,\r\nwho sat down on the bottom stair, and watched the operation\r\nattentively: now and then glancing at the clock face, leaning all\r\naskew, against the wall hard by, and feeling a little confused by a\r\nsuspicion that it was ogling him.\r\n\r\nThe workman on the steps was very civil; and as he said, when he\r\nobserved Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Paul got into conversation with\r\nhim, and told him he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been quite well lately. The ice being thus\r\nbroken, Paul asked him a multitude of questions about chimes and\r\nclocks: as, whether people watched up in the lonely church steeples by\r\nnight to make them strike, and how the bells were rung when people\r\ndied, and whether those were different bells from wedding bells, or\r\nonly sounded dismal in the fancies of the living. Finding that his new\r\nacquaintance was not very well informed on the subject of the Curfew\r\nBell of ancient days, Paul gave him an account of that institution; and\r\nalso asked him, as a practical man, what he thought about King Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidea of measuring time by the burning of candles; to which the workman\r\nreplied, that he thought it would be the ruin of the clock trade if it\r\nwas to come up again. In fine, Paul looked on, until the clock had\r\nquite recovered its familiar aspect, and resumed its sedate inquiry;\r\nwhen the workman, putting away his tools in a long basket, bade him\r\ngood day, and went away. Though not before he had whispered something,\r\non the door-mat, to the footman, in which there was the phrase\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cold-fashioned\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for Paul heard it.\r\n\r\nWhat could that old fashion be, that seemed to make the people sorry!\r\nWhat could it be!\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to learn now, he thought of this frequently; though not\r\nso often as he might have done, if he had had fewer things to think of.\r\nBut he had a great many; and was always thinking, all day long.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was Florence coming to the party. Florence would see that\r\nthe boys were fond of him; and that would make her happy. This was his\r\ngreat theme. Let Florence once be sure that they were gentle and good\r\nto him, and that he had become a little favourite among them, and then\r\nshe would always think of the time he had passed there, without being\r\nvery sorry. Florence might be all the happier too for that, perhaps,\r\nwhen he came back.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back! Fifty times a day, his noiseless little feet went up\r\nthe stairs to his own room, as he collected every book, and scrap, and\r\ntrifle that belonged to him, and put them all together there, down to\r\nthe minutest thing, for taking home! There was no shade of coming back\r\non little Paul; no preparation for it, or other reference to it, grew\r\nout of anything he thought or did, except this slight one in connexion\r\nwith his sister. On the contrary, he had to think of everything\r\nfamiliar to him, in his contemplative moods and in his wanderings about\r\nthe house, as being to be parted with; and hence the many things he had\r\nto think of, all day long.\r\n\r\nHe had to peep into those rooms upstairs, and think how solitary they\r\nwould be when he was gone, and wonder through how many silent days,\r\nweeks, months, and years, they would continue just as grave and\r\nundisturbed. He had to think\xe2\x80\x94would any other child (old-fashioned, like\r\nhimself) stray there at any time, to whom the same grotesque\r\ndistortions of pattern and furniture would manifest themselves; and\r\nwould anybody tell that boy of little Dombey, who had been there once?\r\n\r\nHe had to think of a portrait on the stairs, which always looked\r\nearnestly after him as he went away, eyeing it over his shoulder; and\r\nwhich, when he passed it in the company of anyone, still seemed to gaze\r\nat him, and not at his companion. He had much to think of, in\r\nassociation with a print that hung up in another place, where, in the\r\ncentre of a wondering group, one figure that he knew, a figure with a\r\nlight about its head\xe2\x80\x94benignant, mild, and merciful\xe2\x80\x94stood pointing\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nAt his own bedroom window, there were crowds of thoughts that mixed\r\nwith these, and came on, one upon another, like the rolling waves.\r\nWhere those wild birds lived, that were always hovering out at sea in\r\ntroubled weather; where the clouds rose and first began; whence the\r\nwind issued on its rushing flight, and where it stopped; whether the\r\nspot where he and Florence had so often sat, and watched, and talked\r\nabout these things, could ever be exactly as it used to be without\r\nthem; whether it could ever be the same to Florence, if he were in some\r\ndistant place, and she were sitting there alone.\r\n\r\nHe had to think, too, of Mr Toots, and Mr Feeder, B.A., of all the\r\nboys; and of Doctor Blimber, Mrs Blimber, and Miss Blimber; of home,\r\nand of his aunt and Miss Tox; of his father; Dombey and Son, Walter\r\nwith the poor old Uncle who had got the money he wanted, and that\r\ngruff-voiced Captain with the iron hand. Besides all this, he had a\r\nnumber of little visits to pay, in the course of the day; to the\r\nschoolroom, to Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s study, to Mrs Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\napartment, to Miss Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, and to the dog. For he was free of the\r\nwhole house now, to range it as he chose; and, in his desire to part\r\nwith everybody on affectionate terms, he attended, in his way, to them\r\nall. Sometimes he found places in books for Briggs, who was always\r\nlosing them; sometimes he looked up words in dictionaries for other\r\nyoung gentlemen who were in extremity; sometimes he held skeins of silk\r\nfor Mrs Blimber to wind; sometimes he put Cornelia\xe2\x80\x99s desk to rights;\r\nsometimes he would even creep into the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s study, and, sitting on\r\nthe carpet near his learned feet, turn the globes softly, and go round\r\nthe world, or take a flight among the far-off stars.\r\n\r\nIn those days immediately before the holidays, in short, when the other\r\nyoung gentlemen were labouring for dear life through a general\r\nresumption of the studies of the whole half-year, Paul was such a\r\nprivileged pupil as had never been seen in that house before. He could\r\nhardly believe it himself; but his liberty lasted from hour to hour,\r\nand from day to day; and little Dombey was caressed by everyone. Doctor\r\nBlimber was so particular about him, that he requested Johnson to\r\nretire from the dinner-table one day, for having thoughtlessly spoken\r\nto him as \xe2\x80\x9cpoor little Dombey;\xe2\x80\x9d which Paul thought rather hard and\r\nsevere, though he had flushed at the moment, and wondered why Johnson\r\nshould pity him. It was the more questionable justice, Paul thought, in\r\nthe Doctor, from his having certainly overheard that great authority\r\ngive his assent on the previous evening, to the proposition (stated by\r\nMrs Blimber) that poor dear little Dombey was more old-fashioned than\r\never. And now it was that Paul began to think it must surely be\r\nold-fashioned to be very thin, and light, and easily tired, and soon\r\ndisposed to lie down anywhere and rest; for he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling\r\nthat these were more and more his habits every day.\r\n\r\nAt last the party-day arrived; and Doctor Blimber said at breakfast,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we will resume our studies on the twenty-fifth of next\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots immediately threw off his allegiance, and put on his\r\nring: and mentioning the Doctor in casual conversation shortly\r\nafterwards, spoke of him as \xe2\x80\x9cBlimber\xe2\x80\x9d! This act of freedom inspired the\r\nolder pupils with admiration and envy; but the younger spirits were\r\nappalled, and seemed to marvel that no beam fell down and crushed him.\r\n\r\nNot the least allusion was made to the ceremonies of the evening,\r\neither at breakfast or at dinner; but there was a bustle in the house\r\nall day, and in the course of his perambulations, Paul made\r\nacquaintance with various strange benches and candlesticks, and met a\r\nharp in a green greatcoat standing on the landing outside the\r\ndrawing-room door. There was something queer, too, about Mrs Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead at dinner-time, as if she had screwed her hair up too tight; and\r\nthough Miss Blimber showed a graceful bunch of plaited hair on each\r\ntemple, she seemed to have her own little curls in paper underneath,\r\nand in a play-bill too; for Paul read \xe2\x80\x9cTheatre Royal\xe2\x80\x9d over one of her\r\nsparkling spectacles, and \xe2\x80\x9cBrighton\xe2\x80\x9d over the other.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand array of white waistcoats and cravats in the young\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s bedrooms as evening approached; and such a smell of singed\r\nhair, that Doctor Blimber sent up the footman with his compliments, and\r\nwished to know if the house was on fire. But it was only the\r\nhairdresser curling the young gentlemen, and over-heating his tongs in\r\nthe ardour of business.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul was dressed\xe2\x80\x94which was very soon done, for he felt unwell and\r\ndrowsy, and was not able to stand about it very long\xe2\x80\x94he went down into\r\nthe drawing-room; where he found Doctor Blimber pacing up and down the\r\nroom full dressed, but with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour, as\r\nif he thought it barely possible that one or two people might drop in\r\nby and by. Shortly afterwards, Mrs Blimber appeared, looking lovely,\r\nPaul thought; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite\r\nan excursion to walk round her. Miss Blimber came down soon after her\r\nMama; a little squeezed in appearance, but very charming.\r\n\r\nMr Toots and Mr Feeder were the next arrivals. Each of these gentlemen\r\nbrought his hat in his hand, as if he lived somewhere else; and when\r\nthey were announced by the butler, Doctor Blimber said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay!\r\nGod bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d and seemed extremely glad to see them. Mr Toots was\r\none blaze of jewellery and buttons; and he felt the circumstance so\r\nstrongly, that when he had shaken hands with the Doctor, and had bowed\r\nto Mrs Blimber and Miss Blimber, he took Paul aside, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou think of this, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this modest confidence in himself, Mr Toots\r\nappeared to be involved in a good deal of uncertainty whether, on the\r\nwhole, it was judicious to button the bottom button of his waistcoat,\r\nand whether, on a calm revision of all the circumstances, it was best\r\nto wear his waistbands turned up or turned down. Observing that Mr\r\nFeeder\xe2\x80\x99s were turned up, Mr Toots turned his up; but the waistbands of\r\nthe next arrival being turned down, Mr Toots turned his down. The\r\ndifferences in point of waistcoat-buttoning, not only at the bottom,\r\nbut at the top too, became so numerous and complicated as the arrivals\r\nthickened, that Mr Toots was continually fingering that article of\r\ndress, as if he were performing on some instrument; and appeared to\r\nfind the incessant execution it demanded, quite bewildering.\r\n\r\nAll the young gentlemen, tightly cravatted, curled, and pumped, and\r\nwith their best hats in their hands, having been at different times\r\nannounced and introduced, Mr Baps, the dancing-master, came,\r\naccompanied by Mrs Baps, to whom Mrs Blimber was extremely kind and\r\ncondescending. Mr Baps was a very grave gentleman, with a slow and\r\nmeasured manner of speaking; and before he had stood under the lamp\r\nfive minutes, he began to talk to Toots (who had been silently\r\ncomparing pumps with him) about what you were to do with your raw\r\nmaterials when they came into your ports in return for your drain of\r\ngold. Mr Toots, to whom the question seemed perplexing, suggested \xe2\x80\x9cCook\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr Baps did not appear to think that would do.\r\n\r\nPaul now slipped away from the cushioned corner of a sofa, which had\r\nbeen his post of observation, and went downstairs into the tea-room to\r\nbe ready for Florence, whom he had not seen for nearly a fortnight, as\r\nhe had remained at Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s on the previous Saturday and\r\nSunday, lest he should take cold. Presently she came: looking so\r\nbeautiful in her simple ball dress, with her fresh flowers in her hand,\r\nthat when she knelt down on the ground to take Paul round the neck and\r\nkiss him (for there was no one there, but his friend and another young\r\nwoman waiting to serve out the tea), he could hardly make up his mind\r\nto let her go again, or to take away her bright and loving eyes from\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the matter, Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paul, almost sure that he saw a\r\ntear there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, darling; nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence.\r\n\r\nPaul touched her cheek gently with his finger\xe2\x80\x94and it was a tear! \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nFloy!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go home together, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll nurse you, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNurse me!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Paul.\r\n\r\nPaul couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what that had to do with it, nor why the two\r\nyoung women looked on so seriously, nor why Florence turned away her\r\nface for a moment, and then turned it back, lighted up again with\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, holding a ringlet of her dark hair in his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, dear, Do you think I have grown old-fashioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister laughed, and fondled him, and told him \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I know they say so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cand I want to know what\r\nthey mean, Floy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a loud double knock coming at the door, and Florence hurrying to\r\nthe table, there was no more said between them. Paul wondered again\r\nwhen he saw his friend whisper to Florence, as if she were comforting\r\nher; but a new arrival put that out of his head speedily.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Barnet Skettles, Lady Skettles, and Master Skettles. Master\r\nSkettles was to be a new boy after the vacation, and Fame had been\r\nbusy, in Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s room, with his father, who was in the House of\r\nCommons, and of whom Mr Feeder had said that when he did catch the\r\nSpeaker\xe2\x80\x99s eye (which he had been expected to do for three or four\r\nyears), it was anticipated that he would rather touch up the Radicals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what room is this now, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Skettles to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend, \xe2\x80\x9cMelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s study, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nLady Skettles took a panoramic survey of it through her glass, and said\r\nto Sir Barnet Skettles, with a nod of approval, \xe2\x80\x9cVery good.\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Barnet\r\nassented, but Master Skettles looked suspicious and doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this little creature, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Skettles, turning to Paul.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he one of the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung gentlemen, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am; yes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is your name, my pale child?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Skettles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Paul.\r\n\r\nSir Barnet Skettles immediately interposed, and said that he had had\r\nthe honour of meeting Paul\xe2\x80\x99s father at a public dinner, and that he\r\nhoped he was very well. Then Paul heard him say to Lady Skettles,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCity\xe2\x80\x94very rich\xe2\x80\x94most respectable\xe2\x80\x94Doctor mentioned it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he said\r\nto Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell your good Papa that Sir Barnet Skettles\r\nrejoiced to hear that he was very well, and sent him his best\r\ncompliments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my brave boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Barnet Skettles. \xe2\x80\x9cBarnet,\xe2\x80\x9d to Master\r\nSkettles, who was revenging himself for the studies to come, on the\r\nplum-cake, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a young gentleman you ought to know. This is a\r\nyoung gentleman you may know, Barnet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Barnet Skettles, with\r\nan emphasis on the permission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat eyes! What hair! What a lovely face!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Skettles\r\nsoftly, as she looked at Florence through her glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, presenting her.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of the Skettleses was now complete. And as Lady\r\nSkettles had conceived, at first sight, a liking for Paul, they all\r\nwent upstairs together: Sir Barnet Skettles taking care of Florence,\r\nand young Barnet following.\r\n\r\nYoung Barnet did not remain long in the background after they had\r\nreached the drawing-room, for Dr Blimber had him out in no time,\r\ndancing with Florence. He did not appear to Paul to be particularly\r\nhappy, or particularly anything but sulky, or to care much what he was\r\nabout; but as Paul heard Lady Skettles say to Mrs Blimber, while she\r\nbeat time with her fan, that her dear boy was evidently smitten to\r\ndeath by that angel of a child, Miss Dombey, it would seem that\r\nSkettles Junior was in a state of bliss, without showing it.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul thought it a singular coincidence that nobody had occupied\r\nhis place among the pillows; and that when he came into the room again,\r\nthey should all make way for him to go back to it, remembering it was\r\nhis. Nobody stood before him either, when they observed that he liked\r\nto see Florence dancing, but they left the space in front quite clear,\r\nso that he might follow her with his eyes. They were so kind, too, even\r\nthe strangers, of whom there were soon a great many, that they came and\r\nspoke to him every now and then, and asked him how he was, and if his\r\nhead ached, and whether he was tired. He was very much obliged to them\r\nfor all their kindness and attention, and reclining propped up in his\r\ncorner, with Mrs Blimber and Lady Skettles on the same sofa, and\r\nFlorence coming and sitting by his side as soon as every dance was\r\nended, he looked on very happily indeed.\r\n\r\nFlorence would have sat by him all night, and would not have danced at\r\nall of her own accord, but Paul made her, by telling her how much it\r\npleased him. And he told her the truth, too; for his small heart\r\nswelled, and his face glowed, when he saw how much they all admired\r\nher, and how she was the beautiful little rosebud of the room.\r\n\r\nFrom his nest among the pillows, Paul could see and hear almost\r\neverything that passed as if the whole were being done for his\r\namusement. Among other little incidents that he observed, he observed\r\nMr Baps the dancing-master get into conversation with Sir Barnet\r\nSkettles, and very soon ask him, as he had asked Mr Toots, what you\r\nwere to do with your raw materials, when they came into your ports in\r\nreturn for your drain of gold\xe2\x80\x94which was such a mystery to Paul that he\r\nwas quite desirous to know what ought to be done with them. Sir Barnet\r\nSkettles had much to say upon the question, and said it; but it did not\r\nappear to solve the question, for Mr Baps retorted, Yes, but supposing\r\nRussia stepped in with her tallows; which struck Sir Barnet almost\r\ndumb, for he could only shake his head after that, and say, Why then\r\nyou must fall back upon your cottons, he supposed.\r\n\r\nSir Barnet Skettles looked after Mr Baps when he went to cheer up Mrs\r\nBaps (who, being quite deserted, was pretending to look over the\r\nmusic-book of the gentleman who played the harp), as if he thought him\r\na remarkable kind of man; and shortly afterwards he said so in those\r\nwords to Doctor Blimber, and inquired if he might take the liberty of\r\nasking who he was, and whether he had ever been in the Board of Trade.\r\nDoctor Blimber answered no, he believed not; and that in fact he was a\r\nProfessor of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf something connected with statistics, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sir\r\nBarnet Skettles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no, Sir Barnet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Doctor Blimber, rubbing his chin. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nnot exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFigures of some sort, I would venture a bet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Barnet\r\nSkettles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber, yes, but not of that sort. Mr Baps is a\r\nvery worthy sort of man, Sir Barnet, and\xe2\x80\x94in fact he\xe2\x80\x99s our Professor of\r\ndancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul was amazed to see that this piece of information quite altered Sir\r\nBarnet Skettles\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of Mr Baps, and that Sir Barnet flew into a\r\nperfect rage, and glowered at Mr Baps over on the other side of the\r\nroom. He even went so far as to D\xe2\x80\x94 Mr Baps to Lady Skettles, in telling\r\nher what had happened, and to say that it was like his most\r\ncon-sum-mate and con-foun-ded impudence.\r\n\r\nThere was another thing that Paul observed. Mr Feeder, after imbibing\r\nseveral custard-cups of negus, began to enjoy himself. The dancing in\r\ngeneral was ceremonious, and the music rather solemn\xe2\x80\x94a little like\r\nchurch music in fact\xe2\x80\x94but after the custard-cups, Mr Feeder told Mr\r\nToots that he was going to throw a little spirit into the thing. After\r\nthat, Mr Feeder not only began to dance as if he meant dancing and\r\nnothing else, but secretly to stimulate the music to perform wild\r\ntunes. Further, he became particular in his attentions to the ladies;\r\nand dancing with Miss Blimber, whispered to her\xe2\x80\x94whispered to\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x94though not so softly but that Paul heard him say this remarkable\r\npoetry,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I a heart for falsehood framed,\r\nI ne\xe2\x80\x99er could injure You!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, Paul heard him repeat to four young ladies, in succession. Well\r\nmight Mr Feeder say to Mr Toots, that he was afraid he should be the\r\nworse for it to-morrow!\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber was a little alarmed by this\xe2\x80\x94comparatively\r\nspeaking\xe2\x80\x94profligate behaviour; and especially by the alteration in the\r\ncharacter of the music, which, beginning to comprehend low melodies\r\nthat were popular in the streets, might not unnaturally be supposed to\r\ngive offence to Lady Skettles. But Lady Skettles was so very kind as to\r\nbeg Mrs Blimber not to mention it; and to receive her explanation that\r\nMr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s spirits sometimes betrayed him into excesses on these\r\noccasions, with the greatest courtesy and politeness; observing, that\r\nhe seemed a very nice sort of person for his situation, and that she\r\nparticularly liked the unassuming style of his hair\xe2\x80\x94which (as already\r\nhinted) was about a quarter of an inch long.\r\n\r\nOnce, when there was a pause in the dancing, Lady Skettles told Paul\r\nthat he seemed very fond of music. Paul replied, that he was; and if\r\nshe was too, she ought to hear his sister, Florence, sing. Lady\r\nSkettles presently discovered that she was dying with anxiety to have\r\nthat gratification; and though Florence was at first very much\r\nfrightened at being asked to sing before so many people, and begged\r\nearnestly to be excused, yet, on Paul calling her to him, and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, Floy! Please! For me, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she went straight to the piano,\r\nand began. When they all drew a little away, that Paul might see her;\r\nand when he saw her sitting there all alone, so young, and good, and\r\nbeautiful, and kind to him; and heard her thrilling voice, so natural\r\nand sweet, and such a golden link between him and all his life\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nand happiness, rising out of the silence; he turned his face away, and\r\nhid his tears. Not, as he told them when they spoke to him, not that\r\nthe music was too plaintive or too sorrowful, but it was so dear to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThey all loved Florence. How could they help it! Paul had known\r\nbeforehand that they must and would; and sitting in his cushioned\r\ncorner, with calmly folded hands; and one leg loosely doubled under\r\nhim, few would have thought what triumph and delight expanded his\r\nchildish bosom while he watched her, or what a sweet tranquillity he\r\nfelt. Lavish encomiums on \xe2\x80\x9cDombey\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x9d reached his ears from all\r\nthe boys: admiration of the self-possessed and modest little beauty was\r\non every lip: reports of her intelligence and accomplishments floated\r\npast him, constantly; and, as if borne in upon the air of the summer\r\nnight, there was a half intelligible sentiment diffused around,\r\nreferring to Florence and himself, and breathing sympathy for both,\r\nthat soothed and touched him.\r\n\r\nHe did not know why. For all that the child observed, and felt, and\r\nthought, that night\xe2\x80\x94the present and the absent; what was then and what\r\nhad been\xe2\x80\x94were blended like the colours in the rainbow, or in the\r\nplumage of rich birds when the sun is shining on them, or in the\r\nsoftening sky when the same sun is setting. The many things he had had\r\nto think of lately, passed before him in the music; not as claiming his\r\nattention over again, or as likely evermore to occupy it, but as\r\npeacefully disposed of and gone. A solitary window, gazed through years\r\nago, looked out upon an ocean, miles and miles away; upon its waters,\r\nfancies, busy with him only yesterday, were hushed and lulled to rest\r\nlike broken waves. The same mysterious murmur he had wondered at, when\r\nlying on his couch upon the beach, he thought he still heard sounding\r\nthrough his sister\xe2\x80\x99s song, and through the hum of voices, and the tread\r\nof feet, and having some part in the faces flitting by, and even in the\r\nheavy gentleness of Mr Toots, who frequently came up to shake him by\r\nthe hand. Through the universal kindness he still thought he heard it,\r\nspeaking to him; and even his old-fashioned reputation seemed to be\r\nallied to it, he knew not how. Thus little Paul sat musing, listening,\r\nlooking on, and dreaming; and was very happy.\r\n\r\nUntil the time arrived for taking leave: and then, indeed, there was a\r\nsensation in the party. Sir Barnet Skettles brought up Skettles Junior\r\nto shake hands with him, and asked him if he would remember to tell his\r\ngood Papa, with his best compliments, that he, Sir Barnet Skettles, had\r\nsaid he hoped the two young gentlemen would become intimately\r\nacquainted. Lady Skettles kissed him, and patted his hair upon his\r\nbrow, and held him in her arms; and even Mrs Baps\xe2\x80\x94poor Mrs Baps! Paul\r\nwas glad of that\xe2\x80\x94came over from beside the music-book of the gentleman\r\nwho played the harp, and took leave of him quite as heartily as anybody\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Doctor Blimber,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, stretching out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my little friend,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, looking innocently up\r\ninto his awful face. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk them to take care of Diogenes, if you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiogenes was the dog: who had never in his life received a friend into\r\nhis confidence, before Paul. The Doctor promised that every attention\r\nshould be paid to Diogenes in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and Paul having again\r\nthanked him, and shaken hands with him, bade adieu to Mrs Blimber and\r\nCornelia with such heartfelt earnestness that Mrs Blimber forgot from\r\nthat moment to mention Cicero to Lady Skettles, though she had fully\r\nintended it all the evening. Cornelia, taking both Paul\xe2\x80\x99s hands in\r\nhers, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDombey, Dombey, you have always been my favourite pupil.\r\nGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d And it showed, Paul thought, how easily one might do\r\ninjustice to a person; for Miss Blimber meant it\xe2\x80\x94though she was a\r\nForcer\xe2\x80\x94and felt it.\r\n\r\nA buzz then went round among the young gentlemen, of \xe2\x80\x9cDombey\xe2\x80\x99s going!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s going!\xe2\x80\x9d and there was a general move after Paul and\r\nFlorence down the staircase and into the hall, in which the whole\r\nBlimber family were included. Such a circumstance, Mr Feeder said\r\naloud, as had never happened in the case of any former young gentleman\r\nwithin his experience; but it would be difficult to say if this were\r\nsober fact or custard-cups. The servants, with the butler at their\r\nhead, had all an interest in seeing Little Dombey go; and even the\r\nweak-eyed young man, taking out his books and trunks to the coach that\r\nwas to carry him and Florence to Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s for the night, melted\r\nvisibly.\r\n\r\nNot even the influence of the softer passion on the young gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthey all, to a boy, doted on Florence\xe2\x80\x94could restrain them from taking\r\nquite a noisy leave of Paul; waving hats after him, pressing downstairs\r\nto shake hands with him, crying individually \xe2\x80\x9cDombey, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand indulging in many such ebullitions of feeling, uncommon among those\r\nyoung Chesterfields. Paul whispered Florence, as she wrapped him up\r\nbefore the door was opened, Did she hear them? Would she ever forget\r\nit? Was she glad to know it? And a lively delight was in his eyes as he\r\nspoke to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnce, for a last look, he turned and gazed upon the faces thus\r\naddressed to him, surprised to see how shining and how bright, and\r\nnumerous they were, and how they were all piled and heaped up, as faces\r\nare at crowded theatres. They swam before him as he looked, like faces\r\nin an agitated glass; and next moment he was in the dark coach outside,\r\nholding close to Florence. From that time, whenever he thought of\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, it came back as he had seen it in this last view; and\r\nit never seemed to be a real place again, but always a dream, full of\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThis was not quite the last of Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, however. There was\r\nsomething else. There was Mr Toots. Who, unexpectedly letting down one\r\nof the coach-windows, and looking in, said, with a most egregious\r\nchuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cIs Dombey there?\xe2\x80\x9d and immediately put it up again, without\r\nwaiting for an answer. Nor was this quite the last of Mr Toots, even;\r\nfor before the coachman could drive off, he as suddenly let down the\r\nother window, and looking in with a precisely similar chuckle, said in\r\na precisely similar tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cIs Dombey there?\xe2\x80\x9d and disappeared\r\nprecisely as before.\r\n\r\nHow Florence laughed! Paul often remembered it, and laughed himself\r\nwhenever he did so.\r\n\r\nBut there was much, soon afterwards\xe2\x80\x94next day, and after that\xe2\x80\x94which Paul\r\ncould only recollect confusedly. As, why they stayed at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndays and nights, instead of going home; why he lay in bed, with\r\nFlorence sitting by his side; whether that had been his father in the\r\nroom, or only a tall shadow on the wall; whether he had heard his\r\ndoctor say, of someone, that if they had removed him before the\r\noccasion on which he had built up fancies, strong in proportion to his\r\nown weakness, it was very possible he might have pined away.\r\n\r\nHe could not even remember whether he had often said to Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nFloy, take me home, and never leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d but he thought he had. He\r\nfancied sometimes he had heard himself repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cTake me home, Floy!\r\ntake me home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he could remember, when he got home, and was carried up the\r\nwell-remembered stairs, that there had been the rumbling of a coach for\r\nmany hours together, while he lay upon the seat, with Florence still\r\nbeside him, and old Mrs Pipchin sitting opposite. He remembered his old\r\nbed too, when they laid him down in it: his aunt, Miss Tox, and Susan:\r\nbut there was something else, and recent too, that still perplexed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to Florence, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Florence by\r\nherself, for a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent down over him, and the others stood away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy, my pet, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that Papa in the hall, when they brought me from\r\nthe coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry, and go into his room, Floy, did he, when he saw me\r\ncoming in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence shook her head, and pressed her lips against his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad he didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he did.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell them that I asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nAmazing Artfulness of Captain Cuttle, and a new Pursuit for Walter Gay\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter could not, for several days, decide what to do in the Barbados\r\nbusiness; and even cherished some faint hope that Mr Dombey might not\r\nhave meant what he had said, or that he might change his mind, and tell\r\nhim he was not to go. But as nothing occurred to give this idea (which\r\nwas sufficiently improbable in itself) any touch of confirmation, and\r\nas time was slipping by, and he had none to lose, he felt that he must\r\nact, without hesitating any longer.\r\n\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s chief difficulty was, how to break the change in his affairs\r\nto Uncle Sol, to whom he was sensible it would be a terrible blow. He\r\nhad the greater difficulty in dashing Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x99s spirits with such an\r\nastounding piece of intelligence, because they had lately recovered\r\nvery much, and the old man had become so cheerful, that the little back\r\nparlour was itself again. Uncle Sol had paid the first appointed\r\nportion of the debt to Mr Dombey, and was hopeful of working his way\r\nthrough the rest; and to cast him down afresh, when he had sprung up so\r\nmanfully from his troubles, was a very distressing necessity.\r\n\r\nYet it would never do to run away from him. He must know of it\r\nbeforehand; and how to tell him was the point. As to the question of\r\ngoing or not going, Walter did not consider that he had any power of\r\nchoice in the matter. Mr Dombey had truly told him that he was young,\r\nand that his Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances were not good; and Mr Dombey had\r\nplainly expressed, in the glance with which he had accompanied that\r\nreminder, that if he declined to go he might stay at home if he chose,\r\nbut not in his counting-house. His Uncle and he lay under a great\r\nobligation to Mr Dombey, which was of Walter\xe2\x80\x99s own soliciting. He might\r\nhave begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavour, and might have thought that he was now and then disposed to put\r\na slight upon him, which was hardly just. But what would have been duty\r\nwithout that, was still duty with it\xe2\x80\x94or Walter thought so\xe2\x80\x94and duty must\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Dombey had looked at him, and told him he was young, and that\r\nhis Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances were not good, there had been an expression\r\nof disdain in his face; a contemptuous and disparaging assumption that\r\nhe would be quite content to live idly on a reduced old man, which\r\nstung the boy\xe2\x80\x99s generous soul. Determined to assure Mr Dombey, in so\r\nfar as it was possible to give him the assurance without expressing it\r\nin words, that indeed he mistook his nature, Walter had been anxious to\r\nshow even more cheerfulness and activity after the West Indian\r\ninterview than he had shown before: if that were possible, in one of\r\nhis quick and zealous disposition. He was too young and inexperienced\r\nto think, that possibly this very quality in him was not agreeable to\r\nMr Dombey, and that it was no stepping-stone to his good opinion to be\r\nelastic and hopeful of pleasing under the shadow of his powerful\r\ndispleasure, whether it were right or wrong. But it may have been\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nmay have been\xe2\x80\x94that the great man thought himself defied in this new\r\nexposition of an honest spirit, and purposed to bring it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! at last and at least, Uncle Sol must be told,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Walter,\r\nwith a sigh. And as Walter was apprehensive that his voice might\r\nperhaps quaver a little, and that his countenance might not be quite as\r\nhopeful as he could wish it to be, if he told the old man himself, and\r\nsaw the first effects of his communication on his wrinkled face, he\r\nresolved to avail himself of the services of that powerful mediator,\r\nCaptain Cuttle. Sunday coming round, he set off therefore, after\r\nbreakfast, once more to beat up Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\r\n\r\nIt was not unpleasant to remember, on the way thither, that Mrs\r\nMacStinger resorted to a great distance every Sunday morning, to attend\r\nthe ministry of the Reverend Melchisedech Howler, who, having been one\r\nday discharged from the West India Docks on a false suspicion (got up\r\nexpressly against him by the general enemy) of screwing gimlets into\r\npuncheons, and applying his lips to the orifice, had announced the\r\ndestruction of the world for that day two years, at ten in the morning,\r\nand opened a front parlour for the reception of ladies and gentlemen of\r\nthe Ranting persuasion, upon whom, on the first occasion of their\r\nassemblage, the admonitions of the Reverend Melchisedech had produced\r\nso powerful an effect, that, in their rapturous performance of a sacred\r\njig, which closed the service, the whole flock broke through into a\r\nkitchen below, and disabled a mangle belonging to one of the fold.\r\n\r\nThis the Captain, in a moment of uncommon conviviality, had confided to\r\nWalter and his Uncle, between the repetitions of lovely Peg, on the\r\nnight when Brogley the broker was paid out. The Captain himself was\r\npunctual in his attendance at a church in his own neighbourhood, which\r\nhoisted the Union Jack every Sunday morning; and where he was good\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94the lawful beadle being infirm\xe2\x80\x94to keep an eye upon the boys,\r\nover whom he exercised great power, in virtue of his mysterious hook.\r\nKnowing the regularity of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s habits, Walter made all the\r\nhaste he could, that he might anticipate his going out; and he made\r\nsuch good speed, that he had the pleasure, on turning into Brig Place,\r\nto behold the broad blue coat and waistcoat hanging out of the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s open window, to air in the sun.\r\n\r\nIt appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by\r\nmortal eyes without the Captain; but he certainly was not in them,\r\notherwise his legs\xe2\x80\x94the houses in Brig Place not being lofty\xe2\x80\x94would have\r\nobstructed the street door, which was perfectly clear. Quite wondering\r\nat this discovery, Walter gave a single knock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStinger,\xe2\x80\x9d he distinctly heard the Captain say, up in his room, as if\r\nthat were no business of his. Therefore Walter gave two knocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard the Captain say upon that; and immediately\r\nafterwards the Captain, in his clean shirt and braces, with his\r\nneckerchief hanging loosely round his throat like a coil of rope, and\r\nhis glazed hat on, appeared at the window, leaning out over the broad\r\nblue coat and waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, looking down upon him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, \xe2\x80\x9conly me\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain, with great concern.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGills an\xe2\x80\x99t been and sprung nothing again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Captain Cuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain expressed his gratification, and said he would come down\r\nbelow and open the door, which he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough you\xe2\x80\x99re early, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, eyeing him still\r\ndoubtfully, when they got upstairs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fact is, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, sitting down, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nafraid you would have gone out, and I want to benefit by your friendly\r\ncounsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to take your opinion, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a will, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter related to him what had happened; and the difficulty in which he\r\nfelt respecting his Uncle, and the relief it would be to him if Captain\r\nCuttle, in his kindness, would help him to smooth it away; Captain\r\nCuttle\xe2\x80\x99s infinite consternation and astonishment at the prospect\r\nunfolded to him, gradually swallowing that gentleman up, until it left\r\nhis face quite vacant, and the suit of blue, the glazed hat, and the\r\nhook, apparently without an owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cfor myself, I am young, as\r\nMr Dombey said, and not to be considered. I am to fight my way through\r\nthe world, I know; but there are two points I was thinking, as I came\r\nalong, that I should be very particular about, in respect to my Uncle.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that I deserve to be the pride and delight of his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94you believe me, I know\xe2\x80\x94but I am. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain seemed to make an endeavour to rise from the depths of his\r\nastonishment, and get back to his face; but the effort being\r\nineffectual, the glazed hat merely nodded with a mute, unutterable\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I live and have my health,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am not afraid of\r\nthat, still, when I leave England I can hardly hope to see my Uncle\r\nagain. He is old, Captain Cuttle; and besides, his life is a life of\r\ncustom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr! Of a want of custom?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, suddenly\r\nreappearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, shaking his head: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I meant a life of\r\nhabit, Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x94that sort of custom. And if (as you very truly\r\nsaid, I am sure) he would have died the sooner for the loss of the\r\nstock, and all those objects to which he has been accustomed for so\r\nmany years, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he might die a little sooner for the loss\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his Nevy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, trying to speak gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must do our best\r\nto make him believe that the separation is but a temporary one, after\r\nall; but as I know better, or dread that I know better, Captain Cuttle,\r\nand as I have so many reasons for regarding him with affection, and\r\nduty, and honour, I am afraid I should make but a very poor hand at\r\nthat, if I tried to persuade him of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s my great reason for\r\nwishing you to break it out to him; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the first point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her off a point or so!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain, in a contemplative\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWalter paused to ascertain if the Captain had any particular\r\ninformation to add to this, but as he said no more, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the second point, Captain Cuttle. I am sorry to say, I am not a\r\nfavourite with Mr Dombey. I have always tried to do my best, and I have\r\nalways done it; but he does not like me. He can\xe2\x80\x99t help his likings and\r\ndislikings, perhaps. I say nothing of that. I only say that I am\r\ncertain he does not like me. He does not send me to this post as a good\r\none; he disclaims to represent it as being better than it is; and I\r\ndoubt very much if it will ever lead me to advancement in the\r\nHouse\xe2\x80\x94whether it does not, on the contrary, dispose of me for ever, and\r\nput me out of the way. Now, we must say nothing of this to my Uncle,\r\nCaptain Cuttle, but must make it out to be as favourable and promising\r\nas we can; and when I tell you what it really is, I only do so, that in\r\ncase any means should ever arise of lending me a hand, so far off, I\r\nmay have one friend at home who knows my real situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cin the Proverbs of Solomon you\r\nwill find the following words, \xe2\x80\x98May we never want a friend in need, nor\r\na bottle to give him!\xe2\x80\x99 When found, make a note of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Captain stretched out his hand to Walter, with an air of\r\ndownright good faith that spoke volumes; at the same time repeating\r\n(for he felt proud of the accuracy and pointed application of his\r\nquotation), \xe2\x80\x9cWhen found, make a note of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, taking the immense fist extended to him\r\nby the Captain in both his hands, which it completely filled, next to\r\nmy Uncle Sol, I love you. There is no one on earth in whom I can more\r\nsafely trust, I am sure. As to the mere going away, Captain Cuttle, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care for that; why should I care for that! If I were free to seek\r\nmy own fortune\xe2\x80\x94if I were free to go as a common sailor\xe2\x80\x94if I were free\r\nto venture on my own account to the farthest end of the world\xe2\x80\x94I would\r\ngladly go! I would have gladly gone, years ago, and taken my chance of\r\nwhat might come of it. But it was against my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, and\r\nagainst the plans he had formed for me; and there was an end of that.\r\nBut what I feel, Captain Cuttle, is that we have been a little mistaken\r\nall along, and that, so far as any improvement in my prospects is\r\nconcerned, I am no better off now than I was when I first entered\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s House\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a little worse, for the House may have been\r\nkindly inclined towards me then, and it certainly is not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn again, Whittington,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the disconsolate Captain, after\r\nlooking at Walter for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Walter, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand turn a great many times, too,\r\nCaptain Cuttle, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, before such fortune as his ever turns up\r\nagain. Not that I complain,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in his lively, animated,\r\nenergetic way. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to complain of. I am provided for. I can\r\nlive. When I leave my Uncle, I leave him to you; and I can leave him to\r\nno one better, Captain Cuttle. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you all this because I\r\ndespair, not I; it\xe2\x80\x99s to convince you that I can\xe2\x80\x99t pick and choose in\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s House, and that where I am sent, there I must go, and what I\r\nam offered, that I must take. It\xe2\x80\x99s better for my Uncle that I should be\r\nsent away; for Mr Dombey is a valuable friend to him, as he proved\r\nhimself, you know when, Captain Cuttle; and I am persuaded he won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nless valuable when he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t me there, every day, to awaken his\r\ndislike. So hurrah for the West Indies, Captain Cuttle! How does that\r\ntune go that the sailors sing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Port of Barbados, Boys!\r\n                    Cheerily!\r\nLeaving old England behind us, Boys!\r\n                    Cheerily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere the Captain roared in chorus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cOh cheerily, cheerily!\r\n                                        Oh cheer-i-ly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last line reaching the quick ears of an ardent skipper not quite\r\nsober, who lodged opposite, and who instantly sprung out of bed, threw\r\nup his window, and joined in, across the street, at the top of his\r\nvoice, produced a fine effect. When it was impossible to sustain the\r\nconcluding note any longer, the skipper bellowed forth a terrific\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d intended in part as a friendly greeting, and in part to show\r\nthat he was not at all breathed. That done, he shut down his window,\r\nand went to bed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, handing him the blue coat and\r\nwaistcoat, and bustling very much, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll come and break the news\r\nto Uncle Sol (which he ought to have known, days upon days ago, by\r\nrights), I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you at the door, you know, and walk about until the\r\nafternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, however, scarcely appeared to relish the commission, or to\r\nbe by any means confident of his powers of executing it. He had\r\narranged the future life and adventures of Walter so very differently,\r\nand so entirely to his own satisfaction; he had felicitated himself so\r\noften on the sagacity and foresight displayed in that arrangement, and\r\nhad found it so complete and perfect in all its parts; that to suffer\r\nit to go to pieces all at once, and even to assist in breaking it up,\r\nrequired a great effort of his resolution. The Captain, too, found it\r\ndifficult to unload his old ideas upon the subject, and to take a\r\nperfectly new cargo on board, with that rapidity which the\r\ncircumstances required, or without jumbling and confounding the two.\r\nConsequently, instead of putting on his coat and waistcoat with\r\nanything like the impetuosity that could alone have kept pace with\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s mood, he declined to invest himself with those garments at all\r\nat present; and informed Walter that on such a serious matter, he must\r\nbe allowed to \xe2\x80\x9cbite his nails a bit\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an old habit of mine, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cany time these\r\nfifty year. When you see Ned Cuttle bite his nails, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, then you may\r\nknow that Ned Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s aground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThereupon the Captain put his iron hook between his teeth, as if it\r\nwere a hand; and with an air of wisdom and profundity that was the very\r\nconcentration and sublimation of all philosophical reflection and grave\r\ninquiry, applied himself to the consideration of the subject in its\r\nvarious branches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Captain, in an absent manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s at present coasting round to Whitby, that would deliver such\r\nan opinion on this subject, or any other that could be named, as would\r\ngive Parliament six and beat \xe2\x80\x99em. Been knocked overboard, that man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9ctwice, and none the worse for it. Was beat in his\r\napprenticeship, for three weeks (off and on), about the head with a\r\nring-bolt. And yet a clearer-minded man don\xe2\x80\x99t walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his respect for Captain Cuttle, Walter could not help\r\ninwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage, and devoutly hoping\r\nthat his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his\r\ndifficulties until they were quite settled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you was to take and show that man the buoy at the Nore,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCaptain Cuttle in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask him his opinion of it, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your\r\nUncle\xe2\x80\x99s buttons are. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a man that walks\xe2\x80\x94certainly not on two\r\nlegs\xe2\x80\x94that can come near him. Not near him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s his name, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter, determined to be\r\ninterested in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name\xe2\x80\x99s Bunsby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Lord, it might be anything\r\nfor the matter of that, with such a mind as his!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exact idea which the Captain attached to this concluding piece of\r\npraise, he did not further elucidate; neither did Walter seek to draw\r\nit forth. For on his beginning to review, with the vivacity natural to\r\nhimself and to his situation, the leading points in his own affairs, he\r\nsoon discovered that the Captain had relapsed into his former profound\r\nstate of mind; and that while he eyed him steadfastly from beneath his\r\nbushy eyebrows, he evidently neither saw nor heard him, but remained\r\nimmersed in cogitation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Captain Cuttle was labouring with such great designs, that far\r\nfrom being aground, he soon got off into the deepest of water, and\r\ncould find no bottom to his penetration. By degrees it became perfectly\r\nplain to the Captain that there was some mistake here; that it was\r\nundoubtedly much more likely to be Walter\xe2\x80\x99s mistake than his; that if\r\nthere were really any West India scheme afoot, it was a very different\r\none from what Walter, who was young and rash, supposed; and could only\r\nbe some new device for making his fortune with unusual celerity. \xe2\x80\x9cOr if\r\nthere should be any little hitch between \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Captain,\r\nmeaning between Walter and Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cit only wants a word in season\r\nfrom a friend of both parties, to set it right and smooth, and make all\r\ntaut again.\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s deduction from these considerations was,\r\nthat as he already enjoyed the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey, from\r\nhaving spent a very agreeable half-hour in his company at Brighton (on\r\nthe morning when they borrowed the money); and that, as a couple of men\r\nof the world, who understood each other, and were mutually disposed to\r\nmake things comfortable, could easily arrange any little difficulty of\r\nthis sort, and come at the real facts; the friendly thing for him to do\r\nwould be, without saying anything about it to Walter at present, just\r\nto step up to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x94say to the servant \xe2\x80\x9cWould ye be so\r\ngood, my lad, as report Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle here?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meet Mr Dombey in a\r\nconfidential spirit\xe2\x80\x94hook him by the button-hole\xe2\x80\x94talk it over\xe2\x80\x94make it\r\nall right\xe2\x80\x94and come away triumphant!\r\n\r\nAs these reflections presented themselves to the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and by\r\nslow degrees assumed this shape and form, his visage cleared like a\r\ndoubtful morning when it gives place to a bright noon. His eyebrows,\r\nwhich had been in the highest degree portentous, smoothed their rugged\r\nbristling aspect, and became serene; his eyes, which had been nearly\r\nclosed in the severity of his mental exercise, opened freely; a smile\r\nwhich had been at first but three specks\xe2\x80\x94one at the right-hand corner\r\nof his mouth, and one at the corner of each eye\xe2\x80\x94gradually overspread\r\nhis whole face, and, rippling up into his forehead, lifted the glazed\r\nhat: as if that too had been aground with Captain Cuttle, and were now,\r\nlike him, happily afloat again.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Captain left off biting his nails, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\r\nmy boy, you may help me on with them slops.\xe2\x80\x9d By which the Captain meant\r\nhis coat and waistcoat.\r\n\r\nWalter little imagined why the Captain was so particular in the\r\narrangement of his cravat, as to twist the pendent ends into a sort of\r\npigtail, and pass them through a massive gold ring with a picture of a\r\ntomb upon it, and a neat iron railing, and a tree, in memory of some\r\ndeceased friend. Nor why the Captain pulled up his shirt-collar to the\r\nutmost limits allowed by the Irish linen below, and by so doing\r\ndecorated himself with a complete pair of blinkers; nor why he changed\r\nhis shoes, and put on an unparalleled pair of ankle-jacks, which he\r\nonly wore on extraordinary occasions. The Captain being at length\r\nattired to his own complete satisfaction, and having glanced at himself\r\nfrom head to foot in a shaving-glass which he removed from a nail for\r\nthat purpose, took up his knotted stick, and said he was ready.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s walk was more complacent than usual when they got out\r\ninto the street; but this Walter supposed to be the effect of the\r\nankle-jacks, and took little heed of. Before they had gone very far,\r\nthey encountered a woman selling flowers; when the Captain stopping\r\nshort, as if struck by a happy idea, made a purchase of the largest\r\nbundle in her basket: a most glorious nosegay, fan-shaped, some two\r\nfeet and a half round, and composed of all the jolliest-looking flowers\r\nthat blow.\r\n\r\nArmed with this little token which he designed for Mr Dombey, Captain\r\nCuttle walked on with Walter until they reached the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor, before which they both paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, who felt that Walter must be got rid of\r\nbefore he proceeded any further, and that he had better time his\r\nprojected visit somewhat later in the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you won\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go upon my walk at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I shall be out\r\nof the way, Captain Cuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a good long \xe2\x80\x9cun, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, calling after him.\r\nWalter waved his hand in assent, and went his way.\r\n\r\nHis way was nowhere in particular; but he thought he would go out into\r\nthe fields, where he could reflect upon the unknown life before him,\r\nand resting under some tree, ponder quietly. He knew no better fields\r\nthan those near Hampstead, and no better means of getting at them than\r\nby passing Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nIt was as stately and as dark as ever, when he went by and glanced up\r\nat its frowning front. The blinds were all pulled down, but the upper\r\nwindows stood wide open, and the pleasant air stirring those curtains\r\nand waving them to and fro was the only sign of animation in the whole\r\nexterior. Walter walked softly as he passed, and was glad when he had\r\nleft the house a door or two behind.\r\n\r\nHe looked back then; with the interest he had always felt for the place\r\nsince the adventure of the lost child, years ago; and looked especially\r\nat those upper windows. While he was thus engaged, a chariot drove to\r\nthe door, and a portly gentleman in black, with a heavy watch-chain,\r\nalighted, and went in. When he afterwards remembered this gentleman and\r\nhis equipage together, Walter had no doubt he was a physician; and then\r\nhe wondered who was ill; but the discovery did not occur to him until\r\nhe had walked some distance, thinking listlessly of other things.\r\n\r\nThough still, of what the house had suggested to him; for Walter\r\npleased himself with thinking that perhaps the time might come, when\r\nthe beautiful child who was his old friend and had always been so\r\ngrateful to him and so glad to see him since, might interest her\r\nbrother in his behalf and influence his fortunes for the better. He\r\nliked to imagine this\xe2\x80\x94more, at that moment, for the pleasure of\r\nimagining her continued remembrance of him, than for any worldly profit\r\nhe might gain: but another and more sober fancy whispered to him that\r\nif he were alive then, he would be beyond the sea and forgotten; she\r\nmarried, rich, proud, happy. There was no more reason why she should\r\nremember him with any interest in such an altered state of things, than\r\nany plaything she ever had. No, not so much.\r\n\r\nYet Walter so idealised the pretty child whom he had found wandering in\r\nthe rough streets, and so identified her with her innocent gratitude of\r\nthat night and the simplicity and truth of its expression, that he\r\nblushed for himself as a libeller when he argued that she could ever\r\ngrow proud. On the other hand, his meditations were of that fantastic\r\norder that it seemed hardly less libellous in him to imagine her grown\r\na woman: to think of her as anything but the same artless, gentle,\r\nwinning little creature, that she had been in the days of Good Mrs\r\nBrown. In a word, Walter found out that to reason with himself about\r\nFlorence at all, was to become very unreasonable indeed; and that he\r\ncould do no better than preserve her image in his mind as something\r\nprecious, unattainable, unchangeable, and indefinite\xe2\x80\x94indefinite in all\r\nbut its power of giving him pleasure, and restraining him like an\r\nangel\xe2\x80\x99s hand from anything unworthy.\r\n\r\nIt was a long stroll in the fields that Walter took that day, listening\r\nto the birds, and the Sunday bells, and the softened murmur of the\r\ntown\xe2\x80\x94breathing sweet scents; glancing sometimes at the dim horizon\r\nbeyond which his voyage and his place of destination lay; then looking\r\nround on the green English grass and the home landscape. But he hardly\r\nonce thought, even of going away, distinctly; and seemed to put off\r\nreflection idly, from hour to hour, and from minute to minute, while he\r\nyet went on reflecting all the time.\r\n\r\nWalter had left the fields behind him, and was plodding homeward in the\r\nsame abstracted mood, when he heard a shout from a man, and then a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling to him loudly by name. Turning quickly in his\r\nsurprise, he saw that a hackney-coach, going in the contrary direction,\r\nhad stopped at no great distance; that the coachman was looking back\r\nfrom his box and making signals to him with his whip; and that a young\r\nwoman inside was leaning out of the window, and beckoning with immense\r\nenergy. Running up to this coach, he found that the young woman was\r\nMiss Nipper, and that Miss Nipper was in such a flutter as to be almost\r\nbeside herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStaggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, Mr Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nipper; \xe2\x80\x9cif you please, oh\r\ndo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr Walter, Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the coachman, appealing to Walter, with a sort of\r\nexalting despair; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s been a goin\xe2\x80\x99 on for\r\nup\xe2\x80\x99ards of a mortal hour, and me continivally backing out of no\r\nthoroughfares, where she would drive up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a many fares in this\r\ncoach, first and last, but never such a fare as her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go to Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! She wants to go there! WHERE IS IT?\xe2\x80\x9d growled the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it is!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan, wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Walter, I was\r\nthere once myself, along with Miss Floy and our poor darling Master\r\nPaul, on the very day when you found Miss Floy in the City, for we lost\r\nher coming home, Mrs Richards and me, and a mad bull, and Mrs\r\nRichards\xe2\x80\x99s eldest, and though I went there afterwards, I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nwhere it is, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s sunk into the ground. Oh, Mr Walter, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndesert me, Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, if you please! Miss Floy\xe2\x80\x99s darling\xe2\x80\x94all our\r\ndarlings\xe2\x80\x94little, meek, meek Master Paul! Oh Mr Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he very ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pretty flower!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, wringing her hands, \xe2\x80\x9chas took the\r\nfancy that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see his old nurse, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to bring her\r\nto his bedside, Mrs Staggs, of Polly Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, someone pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreatly moved by what he heard, and catching Susan\xe2\x80\x99s earnestness\r\nimmediately, Walter, now that he understood the nature of her errand,\r\ndashed into it with such ardour that the coachman had enough to do to\r\nfollow closely as he ran before, inquiring here and there and\r\neverywhere, the way to Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens.\r\n\r\nThere was no such place as Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens. It had vanished from the\r\nearth. Where the old rotten summer-houses once had stood, palaces now\r\nreared their heads, and granite columns of gigantic girth opened a\r\nvista to the railway world beyond. The miserable waste ground, where\r\nthe refuse-matter had been heaped of yore, was swallowed up and gone;\r\nand in its frowsy stead were tiers of warehouses, crammed with rich\r\ngoods and costly merchandise. The old by-streets now swarmed with\r\npassengers and vehicles of every kind: the new streets that had stopped\r\ndisheartened in the mud and waggon-ruts, formed towns within\r\nthemselves, originating wholesome comforts and conveniences belonging\r\nto themselves, and never tried nor thought of until they sprung into\r\nexistence. Bridges that had led to nothing, led to villas, gardens,\r\nchurches, healthy public walks. The carcasses of houses, and beginnings\r\nof new thoroughfares, had started off upon the line at steam\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nspeed, and shot away into the country in a monster train.\r\n\r\nAs to the neighbourhood which had hesitated to acknowledge the railroad\r\nin its straggling days, that had grown wise and penitent, as any\r\nChristian might in such a case, and now boasted of its powerful and\r\nprosperous relation. There were railway patterns in its drapers\xe2\x80\x99 shops,\r\nand railway journals in the windows of its newsmen. There were railway\r\nhotels, office-houses, lodging-houses, boarding-houses; railway plans,\r\nmaps, views, wrappers, bottles, sandwich-boxes, and time-tables;\r\nrailway hackney-coach and stands; railway omnibuses, railway streets\r\nand buildings, railway hangers-on and parasites, and flatterers out of\r\nall calculation. There was even railway time observed in clocks, as if\r\nthe sun itself had given in. Among the vanquished was the master\r\nchimney-sweeper, whilom incredulous at Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, who now lived\r\nin a stuccoed house three stories high, and gave himself out, with\r\ngolden flourishes upon a varnished board, as contractor for the\r\ncleansing of railway chimneys by machinery.\r\n\r\nTo and from the heart of this great change, all day and night,\r\nthrobbing currents rushed and returned incessantly like its life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood. Crowds of people and mountains of goods, departing and arriving\r\nscores upon scores of times in every four-and-twenty hours, produced a\r\nfermentation in the place that was always in action. The very houses\r\nseemed disposed to pack up and take trips. Wonderful Members of\r\nParliament, who, little more than twenty years before, had made\r\nthemselves merry with the wild railroad theories of engineers, and\r\ngiven them the liveliest rubs in cross-examination, went down into the\r\nnorth with their watches in their hands, and sent on messages before by\r\nthe electric telegraph, to say that they were coming. Night and day the\r\nconquering engines rumbled at their distant work, or, advancing\r\nsmoothly to their journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, and gliding like tame dragons into the\r\nallotted corners grooved out to the inch for their reception, stood\r\nbubbling and trembling there, making the walls quake, as if they were\r\ndilating with the secret knowledge of great powers yet unsuspected in\r\nthem, and strong purposes not yet achieved.\r\n\r\nBut Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens had been cut up root and branch. Oh woe the day\r\nwhen \xe2\x80\x9cnot a rood of English ground\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94laid out in Staggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nsecure!\r\n\r\nAt last, after much fruitless inquiry, Walter, followed by the coach\r\nand Susan, found a man who had once resided in that vanished land, and\r\nwho was no other than the master sweep before referred to, grown stout,\r\nand knocking a double knock at his own door. He knowed Toodle, he said,\r\nwell. Belonged to the Railroad, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes sir, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan Nipper from the coach window.\r\n\r\nWhere did he live now? hastily inquired Walter.\r\n\r\nHe lived in the Company\xe2\x80\x99s own Buildings, second turning to the right,\r\ndown the yard, cross over, and take the second on the right again. It\r\nwas number eleven; they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mistake it; but if they did, they had\r\nonly to ask for Toodle, Engine Fireman, and any one would show them\r\nwhich was his house. At this unexpected stroke of success Susan Nipper\r\ndismounted from the coach with all speed, took Walter\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and set\r\noff at a breathless pace on foot; leaving the coach there to await\r\ntheir return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the little boy been long ill, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter, as they\r\nhurried on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAiling for a deal of time, but no one knew how much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan;\r\nadding, with excessive sharpness, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, them Blimbers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlimbers?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive myself at such a time as this, Mr Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSusan, \xe2\x80\x9cand when there\xe2\x80\x99s so much serious distress to think about, if I\r\nrested hard on anyone, especially on them that little darling Paul\r\nspeaks well of, but I may wish that the family was set to work in a\r\nstony soil to make new roads, and that Miss Blimber went in front, and\r\nhad the pickaxe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper then took breath, and went on faster than before, as if\r\nthis extraordinary aspiration had relieved her. Walter, who had by this\r\ntime no breath of his own to spare, hurried along without asking any\r\nmore questions; and they soon, in their impatience, burst in at a\r\nlittle door and came into a clean parlour full of children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan Nipper, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mrs\r\nRichards, Mrs Richards, come along with me, my dear creetur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Polly, rising with her honest face and\r\nmotherly figure from among the group, in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs Richards, it\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, though\r\nI may not seem to flatter when I say so, but little Master Paul is very\r\nill, and told his Pa today that he would like to see the face of his\r\nold nurse, and him and Miss Floy hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll come along with me\xe2\x80\x94and Mr\r\nWalter, Mrs Richards\xe2\x80\x94forgetting what is past, and do a kindness to the\r\nsweet dear that is withering away. Oh, Mrs Richards, withering away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSusan Nipper crying, Polly shed tears to see her, and to hear what she\r\nhad said; and all the children gathered round (including numbers of new\r\nbabies); and Mr Toodle, who had just come home from Birmingham, and was\r\neating his dinner out of a basin, laid down his knife and fork, and put\r\non his wife\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet and shawl for her, which were hanging up behind\r\nthe door; then tapped her on the back; and said, with more fatherly\r\nfeeling than eloquence, \xe2\x80\x9cPolly! cut away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they got back to the coach, long before the coachman expected them;\r\nand Walter, putting Susan and Mrs Richards inside, took his seat on the\r\nbox himself that there might be no more mistakes, and deposited them\r\nsafely in the hall of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x94where, by the bye, he saw a\r\nmighty nosegay lying, which reminded him of the one Captain Cuttle had\r\npurchased in his company that morning. He would have lingered to know\r\nmore of the young invalid, or waited any length of time to see if he\r\ncould render the least service; but, painfully sensible that such\r\nconduct would be looked upon by Mr Dombey as presumptuous and forward,\r\nhe turned slowly, sadly, anxiously, away.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the door, when a man came\r\nrunning after him, and begged him to return. Walter retraced his steps\r\nas quickly as he could, and entered the gloomy house with a sorrowful\r\nforeboding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nWhat the Waves were always saying\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul had never risen from his little bed. He lay there, listening to\r\nthe noises in the street, quite tranquilly; not caring much how the\r\ntime went, but watching it and watching everything about him with\r\nobserving eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the sunbeams struck into his room through the rustling blinds, and\r\nquivered on the opposite wall like golden water, he knew that evening\r\nwas coming on, and that the sky was red and beautiful. As the\r\nreflection died away, and a gloom went creeping up the wall, he watched\r\nit deepen, deepen, deepen, into night. Then he thought how the long\r\nstreets were dotted with lamps, and how the peaceful stars were shining\r\noverhead. His fancy had a strange tendency to wander to the river,\r\nwhich he knew was flowing through the great city; and now he thought\r\nhow black it was, and how deep it would look, reflecting the hosts of\r\nstars\xe2\x80\x94and more than all, how steadily it rolled away to meet the sea.\r\n\r\nAs it grew later in the night, and footsteps in the street became so\r\nrare that he could hear them coming, count them as they passed, and\r\nlose them in the hollow distance, he would lie and watch the\r\nmany-coloured ring about the candle, and wait patiently for day. His\r\nonly trouble was, the swift and rapid river. He felt forced, sometimes,\r\nto try to stop it\xe2\x80\x94to stem it with his childish hands\xe2\x80\x94or choke its way\r\nwith sand\xe2\x80\x94and when he saw it coming on, resistless, he cried out! But a\r\nword from Florence, who was always at his side, restored him to\r\nhimself; and leaning his poor head upon her breast, he told Floy of his\r\ndream, and smiled.\r\n\r\nWhen day began to dawn again, he watched for the sun; and when its\r\ncheerful light began to sparkle in the room, he pictured to\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94pictured! he saw\xe2\x80\x94the high church towers rising up into the\r\nmorning sky, the town reviving, waking, starting into life once more,\r\nthe river glistening as it rolled (but rolling fast as ever), and the\r\ncountry bright with dew. Familiar sounds and cries came by degrees into\r\nthe street below; the servants in the house were roused and busy; faces\r\nlooked in at the door, and voices asked his attendants softly how he\r\nwas. Paul always answered for himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am better. I am a great deal\r\nbetter, thank you! Tell Papa so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy little and little, he got tired of the bustle of the day, the noise\r\nof carriages and carts, and people passing and repassing; and would\r\nfall asleep, or be troubled with a restless and uneasy sense again\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nchild could hardly tell whether this were in his sleeping or his waking\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x94of that rushing river. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, will it never stop, Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwould sometimes ask her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is bearing me away, I think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Floy could always soothe and reassure him; and it was his daily\r\ndelight to make her lay her head down on his pillow, and take some\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always watching me, Floy, let me watch you, now!\xe2\x80\x9d They would\r\nprop him up with cushions in a corner of his bed, and there he would\r\nrecline the while she lay beside him: bending forward oftentimes to\r\nkiss her, and whispering to those who were near that she was tired, and\r\nhow she had sat up so many nights beside him.\r\n\r\nThus, the flush of the day, in its heat and light, would gradually\r\ndecline; and again the golden water would be dancing on the wall.\r\n\r\nHe was visited by as many as three grave doctors\xe2\x80\x94they used to assemble\r\ndownstairs, and come up together\xe2\x80\x94and the room was so quiet, and Paul\r\nwas so observant of them (though he never asked of anybody what they\r\nsaid), that he even knew the difference in the sound of their watches.\r\nBut his interest centred in Sir Parker Peps, who always took his seat\r\non the side of the bed. For Paul had heard them say long ago, that that\r\ngentleman had been with his Mama when she clasped Florence in her arms,\r\nand died. And he could not forget it, now. He liked him for it. He was\r\nnot afraid.\r\n\r\nThe people round him changed as unaccountably as on that first night at\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94except Florence; Florence never changed\xe2\x80\x94and what had\r\nbeen Sir Parker Peps, was now his father, sitting with his head upon\r\nhis hand. Old Mrs Pipchin dozing in an easy chair, often changed to\r\nMiss Tox, or his aunt; and Paul was quite content to shut his eyes\r\nagain, and see what happened next, without emotion. But this figure\r\nwith its head upon its hand returned so often, and remained so long,\r\nand sat so still and solemn, never speaking, never being spoken to, and\r\nrarely lifting up its face, that Paul began to wonder languidly, if it\r\nwere real; and in the night-time saw it sitting there, with fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! at the bottom of the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there, except Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe figure lifted up its head, and rose, and coming to the bedside,\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cMy own boy! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul looked it in the face, and thought, was this his father? But the\r\nface so altered to his thinking, thrilled while he gazed, as if it were\r\nin pain; and before he could reach out both his hands to take it\r\nbetween them, and draw it towards him, the figure turned away quickly\r\nfrom the little bed, and went out at the door.\r\n\r\nPaul looked at Florence with a fluttering heart, but he knew what she\r\nwas going to say, and stopped her with his face against her lips. The\r\nnext time he observed the figure sitting at the bottom of the bed, he\r\ncalled to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry for me, dear Papa! Indeed I am quite happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father coming and bending down to him\xe2\x80\x94which he did quickly, and\r\nwithout first pausing by the bedside\xe2\x80\x94Paul held him round the neck, and\r\nrepeated those words to him several times, and very earnestly; and Paul\r\nnever saw him in his room again at any time, whether it were day or\r\nnight, but he called out, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry for me! Indeed I am quite\r\nhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d This was the beginning of his always saying in the morning that\r\nhe was a great deal better, and that they were to tell his father so.\r\n\r\nHow many times the golden water danced upon the wall; how many nights\r\nthe dark, dark river rolled towards the sea in spite of him; Paul never\r\ncounted, never sought to know. If their kindness, or his sense of it,\r\ncould have increased, they were more kind, and he more grateful every\r\nday; but whether they were many days or few, appeared of little moment\r\nnow, to the gentle boy.\r\n\r\nOne night he had been thinking of his mother, and her picture in the\r\ndrawing-room downstairs, and thought she must have loved sweet Florence\r\nbetter than his father did, to have held her in her arms when she felt\r\nthat she was dying\xe2\x80\x94for even he, her brother, who had such dear love for\r\nher, could have no greater wish than that. The train of thought\r\nsuggested to him to inquire if he had ever seen his mother? for he\r\ncould not remember whether they had told him, yes or no, the river\r\nrunning very fast, and confusing his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy, did I ever see Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, darling, why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever see any kind face, like Mama\xe2\x80\x99s, looking at me when I was a\r\nbaby, Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe asked, incredulously, as if he had some vision of a face before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose, Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour old nurse\xe2\x80\x99s. Often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is my old nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she dead too? Floy, are we\r\nall dead, except you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a hurry in the room, for an instant\xe2\x80\x94longer, perhaps; but it\r\nseemed no more\xe2\x80\x94then all was still again; and Florence, with her face\r\nquite colourless, but smiling, held his head upon her arm. Her arm\r\ntrembled very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me that old nurse, Floy, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not here, darling. She shall come to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul closed his eyes with those words, and fell asleep. When he awoke,\r\nthe sun was high, and the broad day was clear and warm. He lay a\r\nlittle, looking at the windows, which were open, and the curtains\r\nrustling in the air, and waving to and fro: then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFloy, is it\r\ntomorrow? Is she come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomeone seemed to go in quest of her. Perhaps it was Susan. Paul\r\nthought he heard her telling him when he had closed his eyes again,\r\nthat she would soon be back; but he did not open them to see. She kept\r\nher word\xe2\x80\x94perhaps she had never been away\xe2\x80\x94but the next thing that\r\nhappened was a noise of footsteps on the stairs, and then Paul\r\nwoke\xe2\x80\x94woke mind and body\xe2\x80\x94and sat upright in his bed. He saw them now\r\nabout him. There was no grey mist before them, as there had been\r\nsometimes in the night. He knew them every one, and called them by\r\ntheir names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is this? Is this my old nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, regarding with\r\na radiant smile, a figure coming in.\r\n\r\nYes, yes. No other stranger would have shed those tears at sight of\r\nhim, and called him her dear boy, her pretty boy, her own poor blighted\r\nchild. No other woman would have stooped down by his bed, and taken up\r\nhis wasted hand, and put it to her lips and breast, as one who had some\r\nright to fondle it. No other woman would have so forgotten everybody\r\nthere but him and Floy, and been so full of tenderness and pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloy! this is a kind good face!\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see it\r\nagain. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away, old nurse! Stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis senses were all quickened, and he heard a name he knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that, who said \xe2\x80\x98Walter\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone\r\nsaid Walter. Is he here? I should like to see him very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody replied directly; but his father soon said to Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cCall him\r\nback, then: let him come up!\xe2\x80\x9d Alter a short pause of expectation,\r\nduring which he looked with smiling interest and wonder, on his nurse,\r\nand saw that she had not forgotten Floy, Walter was brought into the\r\nroom. His open face and manner, and his cheerful eyes, had always made\r\nhim a favourite with Paul; and when Paul saw him, he stretched Out his\r\nhand, and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, hurrying to his bed\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot good-bye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Paul looked at her with the wistful face with which he\r\nhad so often gazed upon her in his corner by the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nplacidly, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye! Walter dear, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94turning his head to where\r\nhe stood, and putting out his hand again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt his father\xe2\x80\x99s breath upon his cheek, before the words had parted\r\nfrom his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember Walter, dear Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, looking in his face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember Walter. I was fond of Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d The feeble hand waved in the\r\nair, as if it cried \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d to Walter once again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lay me down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand, Floy, come close to me, and let me\r\nsee you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSister and brother wound their arms around each other, and the golden\r\nlight came streaming in, and fell upon them, locked together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fast the river runs, between its green banks and the rushes, Floy!\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very near the sea. I hear the waves! They always said so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently he told her the motion of the boat upon the stream was\r\nlulling him to rest. How green the banks were now, how bright the\r\nflowers growing on them, and how tall the rushes! Now the boat was out\r\nat sea, but gliding smoothly on. And now there was a shore before him.\r\nWho stood on the bank?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe put his hands together, as he had been used to do at his prayers. He\r\ndid not remove his arms to do it; but they saw him fold them so, behind\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama is like you, Floy. I know her by the face! But tell them that the\r\nprint upon the stairs at school is not divine enough. The light about\r\nthe head is shining on me as I go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe golden ripple on the wall came back again, and nothing else stirred\r\nin the room. The old, old fashion! The fashion that came in with our\r\nfirst garments, and will last unchanged until our race has run its\r\ncourse, and the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old, old\r\nfashion\xe2\x80\x94Death!\r\n\r\nOh thank GOD, all who see it, for that older fashion yet, of\r\nImmortality! And look upon us, angels of young children, with regards\r\nnot quite estranged, when the swift river bears us to the ocean!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, dear me! To think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, bursting out afresh that\r\nnight, as if her heart were broken, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Dombey and Son should be a\r\nDaughter after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nCaptain Cuttle does a little Business for the Young People\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, in the exercise of that surprising talent for deep-laid\r\nand unfathomable scheming, with which (as is not unusual in men of\r\ntransparent simplicity) he sincerely believed himself to be endowed by\r\nnature, had gone to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house on the eventful Sunday, winking\r\nall the way as a vent for his superfluous sagacity, and had presented\r\nhimself in the full lustre of the ankle-jacks before the eyes of\r\nTowlinson. Hearing from that individual, to his great concern, of the\r\nimpending calamity, Captain Cuttle, in his delicacy, sheered off again\r\nconfounded; merely handing in the nosegay as a small mark of his\r\nsolicitude, and leaving his respectful compliments for the family in\r\ngeneral, which he accompanied with an expression of his hope that they\r\nwould lay their heads well to the wind under existing circumstances,\r\nand a friendly intimation that he would \xe2\x80\x9clook up again\xe2\x80\x9d to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s compliments were never heard of any more. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnosegay, after lying in the hall all night, was swept into the dust-bin\r\nnext morning; and the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s sly arrangement, involved in one\r\ncatastrophe with greater hopes and loftier designs, was crushed to\r\npieces. So, when an avalanche bears down a mountain-forest, twigs and\r\nbushes suffer with the trees, and all perish together.\r\n\r\nWhen Walter returned home on the Sunday evening from his long walk, and\r\nits memorable close, he was too much occupied at first by the tidings\r\nhe had to give them, and by the emotions naturally awakened in his\r\nbreast by the scene through which he had passed, to observe either that\r\nhis Uncle was evidently unacquainted with the intelligence the Captain\r\nhad undertaken to impart, or that the Captain made signals with his\r\nhook, warning him to avoid the subject. Not that the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s signals\r\nwere calculated to have proved very comprehensible, however attentively\r\nobserved; for, like those Chinese sages who are said in their\r\nconferences to write certain learned words in the air that are wholly\r\nimpossible of pronunciation, the Captain made such waves and flourishes\r\nas nobody without a previous knowledge of his mystery, would have been\r\nat all likely to understand.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, however, becoming cognisant of what had happened,\r\nrelinquished these attempts, as he perceived the slender chance that\r\nnow existed of his being able to obtain a little easy chat with Mr\r\nDombey before the period of Walter\xe2\x80\x99s departure. But in admitting to\r\nhimself, with a disappointed and crestfallen countenance, that Sol\r\nGills must be told, and that Walter must go\xe2\x80\x94taking the case for the\r\npresent as he found it, and not having it enlightened or improved\r\nbeforehand by the knowing management of a friend\xe2\x80\x94the Captain still felt\r\nan unabated confidence that he, Ned Cuttle, was the man for Mr Dombey;\r\nand that, to set Walter\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes quite square, nothing was wanted but\r\nthat they two should come together. For the Captain never could forget\r\nhow well he and Mr Dombey had got on at Brighton; with what nicety each\r\nof them had put in a word when it was wanted; how exactly they had\r\ntaken one another\xe2\x80\x99s measure; nor how Ned Cuttle had pointed out that\r\nresources in the first extremity, and had brought the interview to the\r\ndesired termination. On all these grounds the Captain soothed himself\r\nwith thinking that though Ned Cuttle was forced by the pressure of\r\nevents to \xe2\x80\x9cstand by\xe2\x80\x9d almost useless for the present, Ned would fetch up\r\nwith a wet sail in good time, and carry all before him.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this good-natured delusion, Captain Cuttle even\r\nwent so far as to revolve in his own bosom, while he sat looking at\r\nWalter and listening with a tear on his shirt-collar to what he\r\nrelated, whether it might not be at once genteel and politic to give Mr\r\nDombey a verbal invitation, whenever they should meet, to come and cut\r\nhis mutton in Brig Place on some day of his own naming, and enter on\r\nthe question of his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s prospects over a social glass. But\r\nthe uncertain temper of Mrs MacStinger, and the possibility of her\r\nsetting up her rest in the passage during such an entertainment, and\r\nthere delivering some homily of an uncomplimentary nature, operated as\r\na check on the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s hospitable thoughts, and rendered him timid of\r\ngiving them encouragement.\r\n\r\nOne fact was quite clear to the Captain, as Walter, sitting\r\nthoughtfully over his untasted dinner, dwelt on all that had happened;\r\nnamely, that however Walter\xe2\x80\x99s modesty might stand in the way of his\r\nperceiving it himself, he was, as one might say, a member of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s family. He had been, in his own person, connected with the\r\nincident he so pathetically described; he had been by name remembered\r\nand commended in close association with it; and his fortunes must have\r\na particular interest in his employer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. If the Captain had any\r\nlurking doubt whatever of his own conclusions, he had not the least\r\ndoubt that they were good conclusions for the peace of mind of the\r\nInstrument-maker. Therefore he availed himself of so favourable a\r\nmoment for breaking the West Indian intelligence to his friend, as a\r\npiece of extraordinary preferment; declaring that for his part he would\r\nfreely give a hundred thousand pounds (if he had it) for Walter\xe2\x80\x99s gain\r\nin the long-run, and that he had no doubt such an investment would\r\nyield a handsome premium.\r\n\r\nSolomon Gills was at first stunned by the communication, which fell\r\nupon the little back-parlour like a thunderbolt, and tore up the hearth\r\nsavagely. But the Captain flashed such golden prospects before his dim\r\nsight: hinted so mysteriously at Whittingtonian consequences; laid such\r\nemphasis on what Walter had just now told them: and appealed to it so\r\nconfidently as a corroboration of his predictions, and a great advance\r\ntowards the realisation of the romantic legend of Lovely Peg: that he\r\nbewildered the old man. Walter, for his part, feigned to be so full of\r\nhope and ardour, and so sure of coming home again soon, and backed up\r\nthe Captain with such expressive shakings of his head and rubbings of\r\nhis hands, that Solomon, looking first at him then at Captain Cuttle,\r\nbegan to think he ought to be transported with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m behind the time, you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed in apology,\r\npassing his hand nervously down the whole row of bright buttons on his\r\ncoat, and then up again, as if they were beads and he were telling them\r\ntwice over: \xe2\x80\x9cand I would rather have my dear boy here. It\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nold-fashioned notion, I daresay. He was always fond of the sea\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he looked wistfully at Walter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s glad to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sol!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you say that, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go. No,\r\nCaptain Cuttle, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. If my Uncle thinks I could be glad to leave\r\nhim, though I was going to be made Governor of all the Islands in the\r\nWest Indies, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I\xe2\x80\x99m a fixture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cSteady! Sol Gills, take an\r\nobservation of your nevy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing with his eyes the majestic action of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s hook, the\r\nold man looked at Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a certain craft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, with a magnificent sense\r\nof the allegory into which he was soaring, \xe2\x80\x9ca-going to put out on a\r\ncertain voyage. What name is wrote upon that craft indelibly? Is it The\r\nGay? or,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, raising his voice as much as to say,\r\nobserve the point of this, \xe2\x80\x9cis it The Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, drawing Walter to his side, and taking his arm\r\ntenderly through his, \xe2\x80\x9cI know. I know. Of course I know that Wally\r\nconsiders me more than himself always. That\xe2\x80\x99s in my mind. When I say he\r\nis glad to go, I mean I hope he is. Eh? look you, Ned and you too,\r\nWally, my dear, this is new and unexpected to me; and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my\r\nbeing behind the time, and poor, is at the bottom of it. Is it really\r\ngood fortune for him, do you tell me, now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, looking\r\nanxiously from one to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cReally and truly? Is it? I can\r\nreconcile myself to almost anything that advances Wally, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave Wally putting himself at any disadvantage for me, or keeping\r\nanything from me. You, Ned Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, fastening on the\r\nCaptain, to the manifest confusion of that diplomatist; \xe2\x80\x9care you\r\ndealing plainly by your old friend? Speak out, Ned Cuttle. Is there\r\nanything behind? Ought he to go? How do you know it first, and why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs it was a contest of affection and self-denial, Walter struck in with\r\ninfinite effect, to the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s relief; and between them they\r\ntolerably reconciled old Sol Gills, by continued talking, to the\r\nproject; or rather so confused him, that nothing, not even the pain of\r\nseparation, was distinctly clear to his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had not much time to balance the matter; for on the very next day,\r\nWalter received from Mr Carker the Manager, the necessary credentials\r\nfor his passage and outfit, together with the information that the Son\r\nand Heir would sail in a fortnight, or within a day or two afterwards\r\nat latest. In the hurry of preparation: which Walter purposely enhanced\r\nas much as possible: the old man lost what little self-possession he\r\never had; and so the time of departure drew on rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who did not fail to make himself acquainted with all that\r\npassed, through inquiries of Walter from day to day, found the time\r\nstill tending on towards his going away, without any occasion offering\r\nitself, or seeming likely to offer itself, for a better understanding\r\nof his position. It was after much consideration of this fact, and much\r\npondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances, that a\r\nbright idea occurred to the Captain. Suppose he made a call on Mr\r\nCarker, and tried to find out from him how the land really lay!\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle liked this idea very much. It came upon him in a moment\r\nof inspiration, as he was smoking an early pipe in Brig Place after\r\nbreakfast; and it was worthy of the tobacco. It would quiet his\r\nconscience, which was an honest one, and was made a little uneasy by\r\nwhat Walter had confided to him, and what Sol Gills had said; and it\r\nwould be a deep, shrewd act of friendship. He would sound Mr Carker\r\ncarefully, and say much or little, just as he read that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter, and discovered that they got on well together or the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, without the fear of Walter before his eyes (who he knew\r\nwas at home packing), Captain Cuttle again assumed his ankle-jacks and\r\nmourning brooch, and issued forth on this second expedition. He\r\npurchased no propitiatory nosegay on the present occasion, as he was\r\ngoing to a place of business; but he put a small sunflower in his\r\nbutton-hole to give himself an agreeable relish of the country; and\r\nwith this, and the knobby stick, and the glazed hat, bore down upon the\r\noffices of Dombey and Son.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a glass of warm rum-and-water at a tavern close by, to\r\ncollect his thoughts, the Captain made a rush down the court, lest its\r\ngood effects should evaporate, and appeared suddenly to Mr Perch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, in persuasive accents. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of your\r\nGovernors is named Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch admitted it; but gave him to understand, as in official duty\r\nbound, that all his Governors were engaged, and never expected to be\r\ndisengaged any more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, mate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain in his ear; \xe2\x80\x9cmy name\xe2\x80\x99s Cap\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nCuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain would have hooked Perch gently to him, but Mr Perch eluded\r\nthe attempt; not so much in design, as in starting at the sudden\r\nthought that such a weapon unexpectedly exhibited to Mrs Perch might,\r\nin her then condition, be destructive to that lady\xe2\x80\x99s hopes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as just report Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle here, when you get a\r\nchance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying which, the Captain took his seat on Mr Perch\xe2\x80\x99s bracket, and\r\ndrawing out his handkerchief from the crown of the glazed hat which he\r\njammed between his knees (without injury to its shape, for nothing\r\nhuman could bend it), rubbed his head well all over, and appeared\r\nrefreshed. He subsequently arranged his hair with his hook, and sat\r\nlooking round the office, contemplating the clerks with a serene\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s equanimity was so impenetrable, and he was altogether so\r\nmysterious a being, that Perch the messenger was daunted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name was it you said?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Perch, bending down over him as\r\nhe sat on the bracket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99en,\xe2\x80\x9d in a deep hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, keeping time with his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, in the same tone, for he caught it, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it; the Captain, in his diplomacy, was so impressive. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s disengaged now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Perhaps he may be for a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, my lad, I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain him longer than a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, nodding with all the weighty importance that he felt within\r\nhim. Perch, soon returning, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill Captain Cuttle walk this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager, standing on the hearth-rug before the empty\r\nfireplace, which was ornamented with a castellated sheet of brown\r\npaper, looked at the Captain as he came in, with no very special\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, showing all his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe Captain liked his answering with a smile; it looked pleasant. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d began the Captain, rolling his eyes slowly round the little room,\r\nand taking in as much of it as his shirt-collar permitted; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nseafaring man myself, Mr Carker, and Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, as is on your books here,\r\nis almost a son of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter Gay?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, showing all his teeth again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr Gay it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cright!\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nexpressed a warm approval of Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s quickness of perception. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na intimate friend of his and his Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou may have heard your head Governor mention my name?\xe2\x80\x94Captain\r\nCuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with a still wider demonstration than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve the pleasure of his acquaintance. I\r\nwaited upon him down on the Sussex coast there, with my young friend\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, when\xe2\x80\x94in short, when there was a little accommodation wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe Captain nodded his head in a manner that was at once comfortable,\r\neasy, and expressive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, I daresay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI had the honour of arranging the\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cRight again! you had. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntook the liberty of coming here\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, availing himself of the offer. \xe2\x80\x9cA man\r\ndoes get more way upon himself, perhaps, in his conversation, when he\r\nsits down. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you take a cheer yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, standing, perhaps from the force of\r\nwinter habit, with his back against the chimney-piece, and looking down\r\nupon the Captain with an eye in every tooth and gum. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have taken\r\nthe liberty, you were going to say\xe2\x80\x94though it\xe2\x80\x99s none\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee kindly, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain: \xe2\x80\x9cof coming here, on\r\naccount of my friend Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. Sol Gills, his Uncle, is a man of science,\r\nand in science he may be considered a clipper; but he ain\xe2\x80\x99t what I\r\nshould altogether call a able seaman\xe2\x80\x94not man of practice. Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr is as\r\ntrim a lad as ever stepped; but he\xe2\x80\x99s a little down by the head in one\r\nrespect, and that is, modesty. Now what I should wish to put to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain, lowering his voice, and speaking in a kind of\r\nconfidential growl, \xe2\x80\x9cin a friendly way, entirely between you and me,\r\nand for my own private reckoning, \xe2\x80\x9ctill your head Governor has wore\r\nround a bit, and I can come alongside of him, is this.\xe2\x80\x94Is everything\r\nright and comfortable here, and is Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr out\xe2\x80\x99ard bound with a pretty\r\nfair wind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think now, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker, gathering up\r\nhis skirts and settling himself in his position. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a practical\r\nman; what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe acuteness and the significance of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s eye as he cocked it\r\nin reply, no words short of those unutterable Chinese words before\r\nreferred to could describe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, unspeakably encouraged, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say? Am\r\nI right or wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo much had the Captain expressed in his eye, emboldened and incited by\r\nMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s smiling urbanity, that he felt himself in as fair a\r\ncondition to put the question, as if he had expressed his sentiments\r\nwith the utmost elaboration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut\xe2\x80\x99ard bound with fair weather, then, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Cuttle.\r\n\r\nMr Carker smiled assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWind right astarn, and plenty of it,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Captain.\r\n\r\nMr Carker smiled assent again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, greatly relieved and pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhow she headed, well enough; I told Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr so. Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGay has brilliant prospects,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Carker, stretching his mouth\r\nwider yet: \xe2\x80\x9call the world before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the world and his wife too, as the saying is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\ndelighted Captain.\r\n\r\nAt the word \xe2\x80\x9cwife\xe2\x80\x9d (which he had uttered without design), the Captain\r\nstopped, cocked his eye again, and putting the glazed hat on the top of\r\nthe knobby stick, gave it a twirl, and looked sideways at his always\r\nsmiling friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d bet a gill of old Jamaica,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, eyeing him\r\nattentively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re a smiling at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker took his cue, and smiled the more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes no farther?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, making a poke at the door with\r\nthe knobby stick to assure himself that it was shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot an inch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of a capital F perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\nMr Carker didn\xe2\x80\x99t deny it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything about a L,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cor a O?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker still smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right, again?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain in a whisper, with the\r\nscarlet circle on his forehead swelling in his triumphant joy.\r\n\r\nMr Carker, in reply, still smiling, and now nodding assent, Captain\r\nCuttle rose and squeezed him by the hand, assuring him, warmly, that\r\nthey were on the same tack, and that as for him (Cuttle) he had laid\r\nhis course that way all along. \xe2\x80\x9cHe know\xe2\x80\x99d her first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nwith all the secrecy and gravity that the subject demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cin an\r\nuncommon manner\xe2\x80\x94you remember his finding her in the street when she was\r\na\xe2\x80\x99most a babby\xe2\x80\x94he has liked her ever since, and she him, as much as two\r\nyoungsters can. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always said, Sol Gills and me, that they was cut\r\nout for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cat, or a monkey, or a hyena, or a death\xe2\x80\x99s-head, could not have shown\r\nthe Captain more teeth at one time, than Mr Carker showed him at this\r\nperiod of their interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a general indraught that way,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the happy Captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWind and water sets in that direction, you see. Look at his being\r\npresent t\xe2\x80\x99other day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost favourable to his hopes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his being towed along in the wake of that day!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the\r\nCaptain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy what can cut him adrift now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right again,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, giving his hand another\r\nsqueeze. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing it is. So! steady! There\xe2\x80\x99s a son gone: pretty little\r\ncreetur. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a son gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the acquiescent Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass the word, and there\xe2\x80\x99s another ready for you,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevy of a scientific Uncle! Nevy of Sol Gills! Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr! Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, as is\r\nalready in your business! And\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the Captain, rising gradually to a\r\nquotation he was preparing for a final burst, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x94comes from Sol\r\nGills\xe2\x80\x99s daily, to your business, and your buzzums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s complacency as he gently jogged Mr Carker with his elbow,\r\non concluding each of the foregoing short sentences, could be surpassed\r\nby nothing but the exultation with which he fell back and eyed him when\r\nhe had finished this brilliant display of eloquence and sagacity; his\r\ngreat blue waistcoat heaving with the throes of such a masterpiece, and\r\nhis nose in a state of violent inflammation from the same cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, bending down at the knees, for a\r\nmoment, in an odd manner, as if he were falling together to hug the\r\nwhole of himself at once, \xe2\x80\x9cyour views in reference to Walter Gay are\r\nthoroughly and accurately right. I understand that we speak together in\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonour!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo him or anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Manager.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle frowned and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut merely for your own satisfaction and guidance\xe2\x80\x94and guidance, of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a view to your future proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee kindly, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, listening with great\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no hesitation in saying, that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact. You have hit the\r\nprobabilities exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with regard to your head Governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy an\r\ninterview had better come about nat\xe2\x80\x99ral between us. There\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker, with his mouth from ear to ear, repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cTime enough.\xe2\x80\x9d Not\r\narticulating the words, but bowing his head affably, and forming them\r\nwith his tongue and lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as I know\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s what I always said\xe2\x80\x94that Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x99s in a way to make\r\nhis fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make his fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Carker repeated, in the same dumb manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x99s going on this little voyage is, as I may say, in his\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work, and a part of his general expectations here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his general expectations here,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr Carker, dumbly as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, so long as I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry,\r\nand my mind\xe2\x80\x99s at ease.\r\n\r\nMr Carker still blandly assenting in the same voiceless manner, Captain\r\nCuttle was strongly confirmed in his opinion that he was one of the\r\nmost agreeable men he had ever met, and that even Mr Dombey might\r\nimprove himself on such a model. With great heartiness, therefore, the\r\nCaptain once again extended his enormous hand (not unlike an old block\r\nin colour), and gave him a grip that left upon his smoother flesh a\r\nproof impression of the chinks and crevices with which the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalm was liberally tattooed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a man of many words, but I take\r\nit very kind of you to be so friendly, and above-board. You\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse\r\nme if I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at all intruding, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee. My berth ain\xe2\x80\x99t very roomy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, turning back\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s tolerably snug; and if you was to find yourself near\r\nBrig Place, number nine, at any time\xe2\x80\x94will you make a note of it?\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwould come upstairs, without minding what was said by the person at the\r\ndoor, I should be proud to see you.\r\n\r\nWith that hospitable invitation, the Captain said \xe2\x80\x9cGood day!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwalked out and shut the door; leaving Mr Carker still reclining against\r\nthe chimney-piece. In whose sly look and watchful manner; in whose\r\nfalse mouth, stretched but not laughing; in whose spotless cravat and\r\nvery whiskers; even in whose silent passing of his soft hand over his\r\nwhite linen and his smooth face; there was something desperately\r\ncat-like.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious Captain walked out in a state of self-glorification\r\nthat imparted quite a new cut to the broad blue suit. \xe2\x80\x9cStand by, Ned!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done a little business for the\r\nyoungsters today, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his exultation, and in his familiarity, present and prospective,\r\nwith the House, the Captain, when he reached the outer office, could\r\nnot refrain from rallying Mr Perch a little, and asking him whether he\r\nthought everybody was still engaged. But not to be bitter on a man who\r\nhad done his duty, the Captain whispered in his ear, that if he felt\r\ndisposed for a glass of rum-and-water, and would follow, he would be\r\nhappy to bestow the same upon him.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the premises, the Captain, somewhat to the astonishment\r\nof the clerks, looked round from a central point of view, and took a\r\ngeneral survey of the officers part and parcel of a project in which\r\nhis young friend was nearly interested. The strong-room excited his\r\nespecial admiration; but, that he might not appear too particular, he\r\nlimited himself to an approving glance, and, with a graceful\r\nrecognition of the clerks as a body, that was full of politeness and\r\npatronage, passed out into the court. Being promptly joined by Mr\r\nPerch, he conveyed that gentleman to the tavern, and fulfilled his\r\npledge\xe2\x80\x94hastily, for Perch\xe2\x80\x99s time was precious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you for a toast,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d submitted Mr Perch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Captain, in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nMr Perch, who seemed to remember having heard in infancy that there was\r\nonce a poet of that name, made no objection; but he was much astonished\r\nat the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s coming into the City to propose a poet; indeed, if he\r\nhad proposed to put a poet\xe2\x80\x99s statue up\xe2\x80\x94say Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s for example\xe2\x80\x94in\r\na civic thoroughfare, he could hardly have done a greater outrage to Mr\r\nPerch\xe2\x80\x99s experience. On the whole, he was such a mysterious and\r\nincomprehensible character, that Mr Perch decided not to mention him to\r\nMrs Perch at all, in case of giving rise to any disagreeable\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nMysterious and incomprehensible, the Captain, with that lively sense\r\nupon him of having done a little business for the youngsters, remained\r\nall day, even to his most intimate friends; and but that Walter\r\nattributed his winks and grins, and other such pantomimic reliefs of\r\nhimself, to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception\r\nupon old Sol Gills, he would assuredly have betrayed himself before\r\nnight. As it was, however, he kept his own secret; and went home late\r\nfrom the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s house, wearing the glazed hat so much on\r\none side, and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes, that Mrs\r\nMacStinger (who might have been brought up at Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, she was\r\nsuch a Roman matron) fortified herself, at the first glimpse of him,\r\nbehind the open street door, and refused to come out to the\r\ncontemplation of her blessed infants, until he was securely lodged in\r\nhis own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nFather and Daughter\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a hush through Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house. Servants gliding up and down\r\nstairs rustle, but make no sound of footsteps. They talk together\r\nconstantly, and sit long at meals, making much of their meat and drink,\r\nand enjoying themselves after a grim unholy fashion. Mrs Wickam, with\r\nher eyes suffused with tears, relates melancholy anecdotes; and tells\r\nthem how she always said at Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s that it would be so, and\r\ntakes more table-ale than usual, and is very sorry but sociable. Cook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate of mind is similar. She promises a little fry for supper, and\r\nstruggles about equally against her feelings and the onions. Towlinson\r\nbegins to think there\xe2\x80\x99s a fate in it, and wants to know if anybody can\r\ntell him of any good that ever came of living in a corner house. It\r\nseems to all of them as having happened a long time ago; though yet the\r\nchild lies, calm and beautiful, upon his little bed.\r\n\r\nAfter dark there come some visitors\xe2\x80\x94noiseless visitors, with shoes of\r\nfelt\xe2\x80\x94who have been there before; and with them comes that bed of rest\r\nwhich is so strange a one for infant sleepers. All this time, the\r\nbereaved father has not been seen even by his attendant; for he sits in\r\nan inner corner of his own dark room when anyone is there, and never\r\nseems to move at other times, except to pace it to and fro. But in the\r\nmorning it is whispered among the household that he was heard to go\r\nupstairs in the dead night, and that he stayed there\xe2\x80\x94in the room\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nthe sun was shining.\r\n\r\nAt the offices in the City, the ground-glass windows are made more dim\r\nby shutters; and while the lighted lamps upon the desks are half\r\nextinguished by the day that wanders in, the day is half extinguished\r\nby the lamps, and an unusual gloom prevails. There is not much business\r\ndone. The clerks are indisposed to work; and they make assignations to\r\neat chops in the afternoon, and go up the river. Perch, the messenger,\r\nstays long upon his errands; and finds himself in bars of\r\npublic-houses, invited thither by friends, and holding forth on the\r\nuncertainty of human affairs. He goes home to Ball\xe2\x80\x99s Pond earlier in\r\nthe evening than usual, and treats Mrs Perch to a veal cutlet and\r\nScotch ale. Mr Carker the Manager treats no one; neither is he treated;\r\nbut alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day; and it would seem\r\nthat there is something gone from Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s path\xe2\x80\x94some obstacle\r\nremoved\xe2\x80\x94which clears his way before him.\r\n\r\nNow the rosy children living opposite to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, peep from\r\ntheir nursery windows down into the street; for there are four black\r\nhorses at his door, with feathers on their heads; and feathers tremble\r\non the carriage that they draw; and these, and an array of men with\r\nscarves and staves, attract a crowd. The juggler who was going to twirl\r\nthe basin, puts his loose coat on again over his fine dress; and his\r\ntrudging wife, one-sided with her heavy baby in her arms, loiters to\r\nsee the company come out. But closer to her dingy breast she presses\r\nher baby, when the burden that is so easily carried is borne forth; and\r\nthe youngest of the rosy children at the high window opposite, needs no\r\nrestraining hand to check her in her glee, when, pointing with her\r\ndimpled finger, she looks into her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s face, and asks \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, among the knot of servants dressed in mourning, and the\r\nweeping women, Mr Dombey passes through the hall to the other carriage\r\nthat is waiting to receive him. He is not \xe2\x80\x9cbrought down,\xe2\x80\x9d these\r\nobservers think, by sorrow and distress of mind. His walk is as erect,\r\nhis bearing is as stiff as ever it has been. He hides his face behind\r\nno handkerchief, and looks before him. But that his face is something\r\nsunk and rigid, and is pale, it bears the same expression as of old. He\r\ntakes his place within the carriage, and three other gentlemen follow.\r\nThen the grand funeral moves slowly down the street. The feathers are\r\nyet nodding in the distance, when the juggler has the basin spinning on\r\na cane, and has the same crowd to admire it. But the juggler\xe2\x80\x99s wife is\r\nless alert than usual with the money-box, for a child\xe2\x80\x99s burial has set\r\nher thinking that perhaps the baby underneath her shabby shawl may not\r\ngrow up to be a man, and wear a sky-blue fillet round his head, and\r\nsalmon-coloured worsted drawers, and tumble in the mud.\r\n\r\nThe feathers wind their gloomy way along the streets, and come within\r\nthe sound of a church bell. In this same church, the pretty boy\r\nreceived all that will soon be left of him on earth\xe2\x80\x94a name. All of him\r\nthat is dead, they lay there, near the perishable substance of his\r\nmother. It is well. Their ashes lie where Florence in her walks\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\nlonely, lonely walks!\xe2\x80\x94may pass them any day.\r\n\r\nThe service over, and the clergyman withdrawn, Mr Dombey looks round,\r\ndemanding in a low voice, whether the person who has been requested to\r\nattend to receive instructions for the tablet, is there?\r\n\r\nSomeone comes forward, and says \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey intimates where he would have it placed; and shows him, with\r\nhis hand upon the wall, the shape and size; and how it is to follow the\r\nmemorial to the mother. Then, with his pencil, he writes out the\r\ninscription, and gives it to him: adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to have it done at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done immediately, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is really nothing to inscribe but name and age, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man bows, glancing at the paper, but appears to hesitate. Mr Dombey\r\nnot observing his hesitation, turns away, and leads towards the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir;\xe2\x80\x9d a touch falls gently on his mourning cloak;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut as you wish it done immediately, and it may be put in hand when I\r\nget back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so good as read it over again? I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe statuary gives him back the paper, and points out, with his pocket\r\nrule, the words, \xe2\x80\x9cbeloved and only child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt should be, \xe2\x80\x98son,\xe2\x80\x99 I think, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. Of course. Make the correction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father, with a hastier step, pursues his way to the coach. When the\r\nother three, who follow closely, take their seats, his face is hidden\r\nfor the first time\xe2\x80\x94shaded by his cloak. Nor do they see it any more\r\nthat day. He alights first, and passes immediately into his own room.\r\nThe other mourners (who are only Mr Chick, and two of the medical\r\nattendants) proceed upstairs to the drawing-room, to be received by Mrs\r\nChick and Miss Tox. And what the face is, in the shut-up chamber\r\nunderneath: or what the thoughts are: what the heart is, what the\r\ncontest or the suffering: no one knows.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing that they know, below stairs, in the kitchen, is that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit seems like Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d They can hardly persuade themselves but that\r\nthere is something unbecoming, if not wicked, in the conduct of the\r\npeople out of doors, who pursue their ordinary occupations, and wear\r\ntheir everyday attire. It is quite a novelty to have the blinds up, and\r\nthe shutters open; and they make themselves dismally comfortable over\r\nbottles of wine, which are freely broached as on a festival. They are\r\nmuch inclined to moralise. Mr Towlinson proposes with a sigh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmendment to us all!\xe2\x80\x9d for which, as Cook says with another sigh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s room enough, God knows.\xe2\x80\x9d In the evening, Mrs Chick and Miss\r\nTox take to needlework again. In the evening also, Mr Towlinson goes\r\nout to take the air, accompanied by the housemaid, who has not yet\r\ntried her mourning bonnet. They are very tender to each other at dusky\r\nstreet-corners, and Towlinson has visions of leading an altered and\r\nblameless existence as a serious greengrocer in Oxford Market.\r\n\r\nThere is sounder sleep and deeper rest in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house tonight,\r\nthan there has been for many nights. The morning sun awakens the old\r\nhousehold, settled down once more in their old ways. The rosy children\r\nopposite run past with hoops. There is a splendid wedding in the\r\nchurch. The juggler\xe2\x80\x99s wife is active with the money-box in another\r\nquarter of the town. The mason sings and whistles as he chips out\r\nP-A-U-L in the marble slab before him.\r\n\r\nAnd can it be that in a world so full and busy, the loss of one weak\r\ncreature makes a void in any heart, so wide and deep that nothing but\r\nthe width and depth of vast eternity can fill it up! Florence, in her\r\ninnocent affliction, might have answered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my brother, oh my dearly\r\nloved and loving brother! Only friend and companion of my slighted\r\nchildhood! Could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your\r\nearly grave, or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing\r\ninto life beneath this rain of tears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, who held it as a duty incumbent on\r\nher, to improve the occasion, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are as old as I am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will be the prime of life,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will then,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Chick, gently squeezing Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s hand in\r\nacknowledgment of her friendly remark, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will then know that all\r\ngrief is unavailing, and that it is our duty to submit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try, dear aunt I do try,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Florence, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause; my love, as our dear\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x94of whose sound sense and excellent judgment, there cannot\r\npossibly be two opinions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa, I shall really be proud, soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94will tell you, and confirm by her experience,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare called upon on all occasions to make an effort It is required of\r\nus. If any\xe2\x80\x94my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a word. Mis\xe2\x80\x94Mis-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemeanour?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chic \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you! Goodness me, it\xe2\x80\x99s on, the end\r\nof my tongue. Mis-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlaced affection?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Lucretia!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick \xe2\x80\x9cHow very monstrous!\r\nMisanthrope, is the word I want. The idea! Misplaced affection! I say,\r\nif any misanthrope were to put, in my presence, the question \xe2\x80\x98Why were\r\nwe born?\xe2\x80\x99 I should reply, \xe2\x80\x98To make an effort\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, much impressed by the originality of\r\nthe sentiment \xe2\x80\x9cVery good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappily,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have a warning under our own eyes.\r\nWe have but too much reason to suppose, my dear child, that if an\r\neffort had been made in time, in this family, a train of the most\r\ntrying and distressing circumstances might have been avoided. Nothing\r\nshall ever persuade me,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the good matron, with a resolute air,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut that if that effort had been made by poor dear Fanny, the poor\r\ndear darling child would at least have had a stronger constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick abandoned herself to her feelings for half a moment; but, as\r\na practical illustration of her doctrine, brought herself up short, in\r\nthe middle of a sob, and went on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, Florence, pray let us see that you have some strength of\r\nmind, and do not selfishly aggravate the distress in which your poor\r\nPapa is plunged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, kneeling quickly down before her, that she\r\nmight the better and more earnestly look into her face. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me more\r\nabout Papa. Pray tell me about him! Is he quite heartbroken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox was of a tender nature, and there was something in this appeal\r\nthat moved her very much. Whether she saw it in a succession, on the\r\npart of the neglected child, to the affectionate concern so often\r\nexpressed by her dead brother\xe2\x80\x94or a love that sought to twine itself\r\nabout the heart that had loved him, and that could not bear to be shut\r\nout from sympathy with such a sorrow, in such sad community of love and\r\ngrief\xe2\x80\x94or whether she only recognised the earnest and devoted spirit\r\nwhich, although discarded and repulsed, was wrung with tenderness long\r\nunreturned, and in the waste and solitude of this bereavement cried to\r\nhim to seek a comfort in it, and to give some, by some small\r\nresponse\xe2\x80\x94whatever may have been her understanding of it, it moved Miss\r\nTox. For the moment she forgot the majesty of Mrs Chick, and, patting\r\nFlorence hastily on the cheek, turned aside and suffered the tears to\r\ngush from her eyes, without waiting for a lead from that wise matron.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick herself lost, for a moment, the presence of mind on which she\r\nso much prided herself; and remained mute, looking on the beautiful\r\nyoung face that had so long, so steadily, and patiently, been turned\r\ntowards the little bed. But recovering her voice\xe2\x80\x94which was synonymous\r\nwith her presence of mind, indeed they were one and the same thing\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nreplied with dignity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, my dear child, your poor Papa is peculiar at times; and to\r\nquestion me about him, is to question me upon a subject which I really\r\ndo not pretend to understand. I believe I have as much influence with\r\nyour Papa as anybody has. Still, all I can say is, that he has said\r\nvery little to me; and that I have only seen him once or twice for a\r\nminute at a time, and indeed have hardly seen him then, for his room\r\nhas been dark. I have said to your Papa, \xe2\x80\x98Paul!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that is the exact\r\nexpression I used\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Paul! why do you not take something stimulating?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYour Papa\xe2\x80\x99s reply has always been, \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, have the goodness to leave\r\nme. I want nothing. I am better by myself.\xe2\x80\x99 If I was to be put upon my\r\noath to-morrow, Lucretia, before a magistrate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nno doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox expressed her admiration by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Louisa is ever\r\nmethodical!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed her aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cliterally nothing has passed\r\nbetween your poor Papa and myself, until today; when I mentioned to\r\nyour Papa that Sir Barnet and Lady Skettles had written exceedingly\r\nkind notes\xe2\x80\x94our sweet boy! Lady Skettles loved him like a\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\npocket handkerchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox produced one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExceedingly kind notes, proposing that you should visit them for\r\nchange of scene. Mentioning to your Papa that I thought Miss Tox and\r\nmyself might now go home (in which he quite agreed), I inquired if he\r\nhad any objection to your accepting this invitation. He said, \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nLouisa, not the least!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence raised her tearful eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, if you would prefer staying here, Florence, to\r\npaying this visit at present, or to going home with me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should much prefer it, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d was the faint rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange choice, I\r\nmust say. But you always were strange. Anybody else at your time of\r\nlife, and after what has passed\xe2\x80\x94my dear Miss Tox, I have lost my pocket\r\nhandkerchief again\xe2\x80\x94would be glad to leave here, one would suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not like to feel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cas if the house was\r\navoided. I should not like to think that the\xe2\x80\x94his\xe2\x80\x94the rooms upstairs\r\nwere quite empty and dreary, aunt. I would rather stay here, for the\r\npresent. Oh my brother! oh my brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a natural emotion, not to be suppressed; and it would make way\r\neven between the fingers of the hands with which she covered up her\r\nface. The overcharged and heavy-laden breast must some times have that\r\nvent, or the poor wounded solitary heart within it would have fluttered\r\nlike a bird with broken wings, and sunk down in the dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after a pause \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on any account\r\nsay anything unkind to you, and that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know. You will remain\r\nhere, then, and do exactly as you like. No one will interfere with you,\r\nFlorence, or wish to interfere with you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence shook her head in sad assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no sooner begun to advise your poor Papa that he really ought to\r\nseek some distraction and restoration in a temporary change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nChick, \xe2\x80\x9cthan he told me he had already formed the intention of going\r\ninto the country for a short time. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll go very soon.\r\nHe can\xe2\x80\x99t go too soon. But I suppose there are some arrangements\r\nconnected with his private papers and so forth, consequent on the\r\naffliction that has tried us all so much\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think what\xe2\x80\x99s become of\r\nmine: Lucretia, lend me yours, my dear\xe2\x80\x94that may occupy him for one or\r\ntwo evenings in his own room. Your Papa\xe2\x80\x99s a Dombey, child, if ever\r\nthere was one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, drying both her eyes at once with great\r\ncare on opposite corners of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll make an\r\neffort. There\xe2\x80\x99s no fear of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, trembling, \xe2\x80\x9cI might do to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs Chick, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you\r\ntalking about? If your Papa said to Me\xe2\x80\x94I have given you his exact\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, I want nothing; I am better by myself\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94what do you\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99d say to you? You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t show yourself to him, child. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndream of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and lie down on my bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick approved of this resolution, and dismissed her with a kiss.\r\nBut Miss Tox, on a faint pretence of looking for the mislaid\r\nhandkerchief, went upstairs after her; and tried in a few stolen\r\nminutes to comfort her, in spite of great discouragement from Susan\r\nNipper. For Miss Nipper, in her burning zeal, disparaged Miss Tox as a\r\ncrocodile; yet her sympathy seemed genuine, and had at least the\r\nvantage-ground of disinterestedness\xe2\x80\x94there was little favour to be won\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nAnd was there no one nearer and dearer than Susan, to uphold the\r\nstriving heart in its anguish? Was there no other neck to clasp; no\r\nother face to turn to? no one else to say a soothing word to such deep\r\nsorrow? Was Florence so alone in the bleak world that nothing else\r\nremained to her? Nothing. Stricken motherless and brotherless at\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94for in the loss of little Paul, that first and greatest loss fell\r\nheavily upon her\xe2\x80\x94this was the only help she had. Oh, who can tell how\r\nmuch she needed help at first!\r\n\r\nAt first, when the house subsided into its accustomed course, and they\r\nhad all gone away, except the servants, and her father shut up in his\r\nown rooms, Florence could do nothing but weep, and wander up and down,\r\nand sometimes, in a sudden pang of desolate remembrance, fly to her own\r\nchamber, wring her hands, lay her face down on her bed, and know no\r\nconsolation: nothing but the bitterness and cruelty of grief. This\r\ncommonly ensued upon the recognition of some spot or object very\r\ntenderly associated with him; and it made the miserable house, at\r\nfirst, a place of agony.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the nature of pure love to burn so fiercely and\r\nunkindly long. The flame that in its grosser composition has the taint\r\nof earth may prey upon the breast that gives it shelter; but the fire\r\nfrom heaven is as gentle in the heart, as when it rested on the heads\r\nof the assembled twelve, and showed each man his brother, brightened\r\nand unhurt. The image conjured up, there soon returned the placid face,\r\nthe softened voice, the loving looks, the quiet trustfulness and peace;\r\nand Florence, though she wept still, wept more tranquilly, and courted\r\nthe remembrance.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before the golden water, dancing on the wall, in\r\nthe old place, at the old serene time, had her calm eye fixed upon it\r\nas it ebbed away. It was not very long before that room again knew her,\r\noften; sitting there alone, as patient and as mild as when she had\r\nwatched beside the little bed. When any sharp sense of its being empty\r\nsmote upon her, she could kneel beside it, and pray GOD\xe2\x80\x94it was the\r\npouring out of her full heart\xe2\x80\x94to let one angel love her and remember\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before, in the midst of the dismal house so wide\r\nand dreary, her low voice in the twilight, slowly and stopping\r\nsometimes, touched the old air to which he had so often listened, with\r\nhis drooping head upon her arm. And after that, and when it was quite\r\ndark, a little strain of music trembled in the room: so softly played\r\nand sung, that it was more like the mournful recollection of what she\r\nhad done at his request on that last night, than the reality repeated.\r\nBut it was repeated, often\xe2\x80\x94very often, in the shadowy solitude; and\r\nbroken murmurs of the strain still trembled on the keys, when the sweet\r\nvoice was hushed in tears.\r\n\r\nThus she gained heart to look upon the work with which her fingers had\r\nbeen busy by his side on the sea-shore; and thus it was not very long\r\nbefore she took to it again\xe2\x80\x94with something of a human love for it, as\r\nif it had been sentient and had known him; and, sitting in a window,\r\nnear her mother\xe2\x80\x99s picture, in the unused room so long deserted, wore\r\naway the thoughtful hours.\r\n\r\nWhy did the dark eyes turn so often from this work to where the rosy\r\nchildren lived? They were not immediately suggestive of her loss; for\r\nthey were all girls: four little sisters. But they were motherless like\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94and had a father.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to know when he had gone out and was expected home, for the\r\nelder child was always dressed and waiting for him at the drawing-room\r\nwindow, or on the balcony; and when he appeared, her expectant face\r\nlighted up with joy, while the others at the high window, and always on\r\nthe watch too, clapped their hands, and drummed them on the sill, and\r\ncalled to him. The elder child would come down to the hall, and put her\r\nhand in his, and lead him up the stairs; and Florence would see her\r\nafterwards sitting by his side, or on his knee, or hanging coaxingly\r\nabout his neck and talking to him: and though they were always gay\r\ntogether, he would often watch her face as if he thought her like her\r\nmother that was dead. Florence would sometimes look no more at this,\r\nand bursting into tears would hide behind the curtain as if she were\r\nfrightened, or would hurry from the window. Yet she could not help\r\nreturning; and her work would soon fall unheeded from her hands again.\r\n\r\nIt was the house that had been empty, years ago. It had remained so for\r\na long time. At last, and while she had been away from home, this\r\nfamily had taken it; and it was repaired and newly painted; and there\r\nwere birds and flowers about it; and it looked very different from its\r\nold self. But she never thought of the house. The children and their\r\nfather were all in all.\r\n\r\nWhen he had dined, she could see them, through the open windows, go\r\ndown with their governess or nurse, and cluster round the table; and in\r\nthe still summer weather, the sound of their childish voices and clear\r\nlaughter would come ringing across the street, into the drooping air of\r\nthe room in which she sat. Then they would climb and clamber upstairs\r\nwith him, and romp about him on the sofa, or group themselves at his\r\nknee, a very nosegay of little faces, while he seemed to tell them some\r\nstory. Or they would come running out into the balcony; and then\r\nFlorence would hide herself quickly, lest it should check them in their\r\njoy, to see her in her black dress, sitting there alone.\r\n\r\nThe elder child remained with her father when the rest had gone away,\r\nand made his tea for him\xe2\x80\x94happy little house-keeper she was then!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsat conversing with him, sometimes at the window, sometimes in the\r\nroom, until the candles came. He made her his companion, though she was\r\nsome years younger than Florence; and she could be as staid and\r\npleasantly demure, with her little book or work-box, as a woman. When\r\nthey had candles, Florence from her own dark room was not afraid to\r\nlook again. But when the time came for the child to say \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\r\nPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d and go to bed, Florence would sob and tremble as she raised her\r\nface to him, and could look no more.\r\n\r\nThough still she would turn, again and again, before going to bed\r\nherself from the simple air that had lulled him to rest so often, long\r\nago, and from the other low soft broken strain of music, back to that\r\nhouse. But that she ever thought of it, or watched it, was a secret\r\nwhich she kept within her own young breast.\r\n\r\nAnd did that breast of Florence\xe2\x80\x94Florence, so ingenuous and true\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nworthy of the love that he had borne her, and had whispered in his last\r\nfaint words\xe2\x80\x94whose guileless heart was mirrored in the beauty of her\r\nface, and breathed in every accent of her gentle voice\xe2\x80\x94did that young\r\nbreast hold any other secret? Yes. One more.\r\n\r\nWhen no one in the house was stirring, and the lights were all\r\nextinguished, she would softly leave her own room, and with noiseless\r\nfeet descend the staircase, and approach her father\xe2\x80\x99s door. Against it,\r\nscarcely breathing, she would rest her face and head, and press her\r\nlips, in the yearning of her love. She crouched upon the cold stone\r\nfloor outside it, every night, to listen even for his breath; and in\r\nher one absorbing wish to be allowed to show him some affection, to be\r\na consolation to him, to win him over to the endurance of some\r\ntenderness from her, his solitary child, she would have knelt down at\r\nhis feet, if she had dared, in humble supplication.\r\n\r\nNo one knew it. No one thought of it. The door was ever closed, and he\r\nshut up within. He went out once or twice, and it was said in the house\r\nthat he was very soon going on his country journey; but he lived in\r\nthose rooms, and lived alone, and never saw her, or inquired for her.\r\nPerhaps he did not even know that she was in the house.\r\n\r\nOne day, about a week after the funeral, Florence was sitting at her\r\nwork, when Susan appeared, with a face half laughing and half crying,\r\nto announce a visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA visitor! To me, Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, looking up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is a wonder, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it now, Miss Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nwish you had a many visitors, I do, indeed, for you\xe2\x80\x99d be all the better\r\nfor it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion that the sooner you and me goes even to\r\nthem old Skettleses, Miss, the better for both, I may not wish to live\r\nin crowds, Miss Floy, but still I\xe2\x80\x99m not a oyster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo do Miss Nipper justice, she spoke more for her young mistress than\r\nherself; and her face showed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the visitor, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\nSusan, with an hysterical explosion that was as much a laugh as a sob,\r\nand as much a sob as a laugh, answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Toots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile that appeared on Florence\xe2\x80\x99s face passed from it in a moment,\r\nand her eyes filled with tears. But at any rate it was a smile, and\r\nthat gave great satisfaction to Miss Nipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own feelings exactly, Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, putting her apron to\r\nher eyes, and shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cImmediately I see that Innocent in the\r\nHall, Miss Floy, I burst out laughing first, and then I choked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper involuntarily proceeded to do the like again on the spot.\r\nIn the meantime Mr Toots, who had come upstairs after her, all\r\nunconscious of the effect he produced, announced himself with his\r\nknuckles on the door, and walked in very briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very well, I thank you;\r\nhow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots\xe2\x80\x94than whom there were few better fellows in the world, though\r\nthere may have been one or two brighter spirits\xe2\x80\x94had laboriously\r\ninvented this long burst of discourse with the view of relieving the\r\nfeelings both of Florence and himself. But finding that he had run\r\nthrough his property, as it were, in an injudicious manner, by\r\nsquandering the whole before taking a chair, or before Florence had\r\nuttered a word, or before he had well got in at the door, he deemed it\r\nadvisable to begin again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very well, I thank you;\r\nhow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence gave him her hand, and said she was very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very well indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, taking a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well\r\nindeed, I am. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, after reflecting a\r\nlittle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was ever better, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, taking up her work, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots responded with a chuckle. Thinking that might be too lively,\r\nhe corrected it with a sigh. Thinking that might be too melancholy, he\r\ncorrected it with a chuckle. Not thoroughly pleasing himself with\r\neither mode of reply, he breathed hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were very kind to my dear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, obeying her own\r\nnatural impulse to relieve him by saying so. \xe2\x80\x9cHe often talked to me\r\nabout you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cWarm, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful weather,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt agrees with me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever was so well\r\nas I find myself at present, I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to you.\r\n\r\nAfter stating this curious and unexpected fact, Mr Toots fell into a\r\ndeep well of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have left Dr Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, trying to help\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots. And tumbled in again.\r\n\r\nHe remained at the bottom, apparently drowned, for at least ten\r\nminutes. At the expiration of that period, he suddenly floated, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Good morning, Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, though. No, not just at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, sitting\r\ndown again, most unexpectedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is\xe2\x80\x94I say, Miss Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, with a quiet smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould be very glad if you would talk about my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, though?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Toots, with sympathy in every fibre of\r\nhis otherwise expressionless face. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dombey! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I never\r\nthought that Burgess and Co.\xe2\x80\x94fashionable tailors (but very dear), that\r\nwe used to talk about\xe2\x80\x94would make this suit of clothes for such a\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots was dressed in mourning. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dombey! I say! Miss\r\nDombey!\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a friend he took to very much at last. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nhave him, perhaps, as a sort of keepsake. You remember his remembering\r\nDiogenes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! oh yes\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dombey! So do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, seeing Florence in tears, had great difficulty in getting\r\nbeyond this point, and had nearly tumbled into the well again. But a\r\nchuckle saved him on the brink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey! I could have had him stolen for\r\nten shillings, if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given him up: and I would: but they were\r\nglad to get rid of him, I think. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have him, he\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\ndoor. I brought him on purpose for you. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t a lady\xe2\x80\x99s dog, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Diogenes was at that moment, as they presently ascertained\r\nfrom looking down into the street, staring through the window of a\r\nhackney cabriolet, into which, for conveyance to that spot, he had been\r\nensnared, on a false pretence of rats among the straw. Sooth to say, he\r\nwas as unlike a lady\xe2\x80\x99s dog as might be; and in his gruff anxiety to get\r\nout, presented an appearance sufficiently unpromising, as he gave short\r\nyelps out of one side of his mouth, and overbalancing himself by the\r\nintensity of every one of those efforts, tumbled down into the straw,\r\nand then sprung panting up again, putting out his tongue, as if he had\r\ncome express to a Dispensary to be examined for his health.\r\n\r\nBut though Diogenes was as ridiculous a dog as one would meet with on a\r\nsummer\xe2\x80\x99s day; a blundering, ill-favoured, clumsy, bullet-headed dog,\r\ncontinually acting on a wrong idea that there was an enemy in the\r\nneighbourhood, whom it was meritorious to bark at; and though he was\r\nfar from good-tempered, and certainly was not clever, and had hair all\r\nover his eyes, and a comic nose, and an inconsistent tail, and a gruff\r\nvoice; he was dearer to Florence, in virtue of that parting remembrance\r\nof him, and that request that he might be taken care of, than the most\r\nvaluable and beautiful of his kind. So dear, indeed, was this same ugly\r\nDiogenes, and so welcome to her, that she took the jewelled hand of Mr\r\nToots and kissed it in her gratitude. And when Diogenes, released, came\r\ntearing up the stairs and bouncing into the room (such a business as\r\nthere was, first, to get him out of the cabriolet!), dived under all\r\nthe furniture, and wound a long iron chain, that dangled from his neck,\r\nround legs of chairs and tables, and then tugged at it until his eyes\r\nbecame unnaturally visible, in consequence of their nearly starting out\r\nof his head; and when he growled at Mr Toots, who affected familiarity;\r\nand went pell-mell at Towlinson, morally convinced that he was the\r\nenemy whom he had barked at round the corner all his life and had never\r\nseen yet; Florence was as pleased with him as if he had been a miracle\r\nof discretion.\r\n\r\nMr Toots was so overjoyed by the success of his present, and was so\r\ndelighted to see Florence bending down over Diogenes, smoothing his\r\ncoarse back with her little delicate hand\xe2\x80\x94Diogenes graciously allowing\r\nit from the first moment of their acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94that he felt it\r\ndifficult to take leave, and would, no doubt, have been a much longer\r\ntime in making up his mind to do so, if he had not been assisted by\r\nDiogenes himself, who suddenly took it into his head to bay Mr Toots,\r\nand to make short runs at him with his mouth open. Not exactly seeing\r\nhis way to the end of these demonstrations, and sensible that they\r\nplaced the pantaloons constructed by the art of Burgess and Co. in\r\njeopardy, Mr Toots, with chuckles, lapsed out at the door: by which,\r\nafter looking in again two or three times, without any object at all,\r\nand being on each occasion greeted with a fresh run from Diogenes, he\r\nfinally took himself off and got away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, Di! Dear Di! Make friends with your new mistress. Let us\r\nlove each other, Di!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, fondling his shaggy head. And Di,\r\nthe rough and gruff, as if his hairy hide were pervious to the tear\r\nthat dropped upon it, and his dog\xe2\x80\x99s heart melted as it fell, put his\r\nnose up to her face, and swore fidelity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDiogenes the man did not speak plainer to Alexander the Great than\r\nDiogenes the dog spoke to Florence. He subscribed to the offer of his\r\nlittle mistress cheerfully, and devoted himself to her service. A\r\nbanquet was immediately provided for him in a corner; and when he had\r\neaten and drunk his fill, he went to the window where Florence was\r\nsitting, looking on, rose up on his hind legs, with his awkward fore\r\npaws on her shoulders, licked her face and hands, nestled his great\r\nhead against her heart, and wagged his tail till he was tired. Finally,\r\nDiogenes coiled himself up at her feet and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAlthough Miss Nipper was nervous in regard of dogs, and felt it\r\nnecessary to come into the room with her skirts carefully collected\r\nabout her, as if she were crossing a brook on stepping-stones; also to\r\nutter little screams and stand up on chairs when Diogenes stretched\r\nhimself, she was in her own manner affected by the kindness of Mr\r\nToots, and could not see Florence so alive to the attachment and\r\nsociety of this rude friend of little Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, without some mental\r\ncomments thereupon that brought the water to her eyes. Mr Dombey, as a\r\npart of her reflections, may have been, in the association of ideas,\r\nconnected with the dog; but, at any rate, after observing Diogenes and\r\nhis mistress all the evening, and after exerting herself with much\r\ngood-will to provide Diogenes a bed in an ante-chamber outside his\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s door, she said hurriedly to Florence, before leaving her for\r\nthe night:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Pa\xe2\x80\x99s a going off, Miss Floy, tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss; that\xe2\x80\x99s the orders. Early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, without looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere Papa is\r\ngoing, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, Miss. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet that precious Major first, and I\r\nmust say if I was acquainted with any Major myself (which Heavens\r\nforbid), it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a blue one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d urged Florence gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Nipper, who was full of burning\r\nindignation, and minded her stops even less than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit, blue he is, and while I was a Christian, although humble, I would\r\nhave natural-coloured friends, or none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared from what she added and had gleaned downstairs, that Mrs\r\nChick had proposed the Major for Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s companion, and that Mr\r\nDombey, after some hesitation, had invited him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk of him being a change, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Nipper to herself\r\nwith boundless contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s a change, give me a constancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my darling dear Miss Floy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone of commiseration smote the chord so often roughly touched, but\r\nnever listened to while she or anyone looked on. Florence left alone,\r\nlaid her head upon her hand, and pressing the other over her swelling\r\nheart, held free communication with her sorrows.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet night; and the melancholy rain fell pattering and dropping\r\nwith a weary sound. A sluggish wind was blowing, and went moaning round\r\nthe house, as if it were in pain or grief. A shrill noise quivered\r\nthrough the trees. While she sat weeping, it grew late, and dreary\r\nmidnight tolled out from the steeples.\r\n\r\nFlorence was little more than a child in years\xe2\x80\x94not yet fourteen\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nloneliness and gloom of such an hour in the great house where Death had\r\nlately made its own tremendous devastation, might have set an older\r\nfancy brooding on vague terrors. But her innocent imagination was too\r\nfull of one theme to admit them. Nothing wandered in her thoughts but\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94a wandering love, indeed, and castaway\xe2\x80\x94but turning always to her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the dropping of the rain, the moaning of the wind,\r\nthe shuddering of the trees, the striking of the solemn clocks, that\r\nshook this one thought, or diminished its interest. Her recollections\r\nof the dear dead boy\xe2\x80\x94and they were never absent\xe2\x80\x94were itself, the same\r\nthing. And oh, to be shut out: to be so lost: never to have looked into\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s face or touched him, since that hour!\r\n\r\nShe could not go to bed, poor child, and never had gone yet, since\r\nthen, without making her nightly pilgrimage to his door. It would have\r\nbeen a strange sad sight, to see her now, stealing lightly down the\r\nstairs through the thick gloom, and stopping at it with a beating\r\nheart, and blinded eyes, and hair that fell down loosely and unthought\r\nof; and touching it outside with her wet cheek. But the night covered\r\nit, and no one knew.\r\n\r\nThe moment that she touched the door on this night, Florence found that\r\nit was open. For the first time it stood open, though by but a\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth: and there was a light within. The first impulse of the\r\ntimid child\xe2\x80\x94and she yielded to it\xe2\x80\x94was to retire swiftly. Her next, to\r\ngo back, and to enter; and this second impulse held her in irresolution\r\non the staircase.\r\n\r\nIn its standing open, even by so much as that chink, there seemed to be\r\nhope. There was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within,\r\nstealing through the dark stern doorway, and falling in a thread upon\r\nthe marble floor. She turned back, hardly knowing what she did, but\r\nurged on by the love within her, and the trial they had undergone\r\ntogether, but not shared: and with her hands a little raised and\r\ntrembling, glided in.\r\n\r\nHer father sat at his old table in the middle room. He had been\r\narranging some papers, and destroying others, and the latter lay in\r\nfragile ruins before him. The rain dripped heavily upon the glass panes\r\nin the outer room, where he had so often watched poor Paul, a baby; and\r\nthe low complainings of the wind were heard without.\r\n\r\nBut not by him. He sat with his eyes fixed on the table, so immersed in\r\nthought, that a far heavier tread than the light foot of his child\r\ncould make, might have failed to rouse him. His face was turned towards\r\nher. By the waning lamp, and at that haggard hour, it looked worn and\r\ndejected; and in the utter loneliness surrounding him, there was an\r\nappeal to Florence that struck home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Papa! speak to me, dear Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started at her voice, and leaped up from his seat. She was close\r\nbefore him with extended arms, but he fell back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you come here? What has\r\nfrightened you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf anything had frightened her, it was the face he turned upon her. The\r\nglowing love within the breast of his young daughter froze before it,\r\nand she stood and looked at him as if stricken into stone.\r\n\r\nThere was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it. There was not one\r\ngleam of interest, parental recognition, or relenting in it. There was\r\na change in it, but not of that kind. The old indifference and cold\r\nconstraint had given place to something: what, she never thought and\r\ndid not dare to think, and yet she felt it in its force, and knew it\r\nwell without a name: that as it looked upon her, seemed to cast a\r\nshadow on her head.\r\n\r\nDid he see before him the successful rival of his son, in health and\r\nlife? Did he look upon his own successful rival in that son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffection? Did a mad jealousy and withered pride, poison sweet\r\nremembrances that should have endeared and made her precious to him?\r\nCould it be possible that it was gall to him to look upon her in her\r\nbeauty and her promise: thinking of his infant boy!\r\n\r\nFlorence had no such thoughts. But love is quick to know when it is\r\nspurned and hopeless: and hope died out of hers, as she stood looking\r\nin her father\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you, Florence, are you frightened? Is there anything the matter,\r\nthat you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came, Papa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst my wishes. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw he knew why: it was written broadly on his face: and dropped\r\nher head upon her hands with one prolonged low cry.\r\n\r\nLet him remember it in that room, years to come. It has faded from the\r\nair, before he breaks the silence. It may pass as quickly from his\r\nbrain, as he believes, but it is there. Let him remember it in that\r\nroom, years to come!\r\n\r\nHe took her by the arm. His hand was cold, and loose, and scarcely\r\nclosed upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking up the light, and leading\r\nher towards the door, \xe2\x80\x9cand want rest. We all want rest. Go, Florence.\r\nYou have been dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dream she had had, was over then, God help her! and she felt that\r\nit could never more come back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will remain here to light you up the stairs. The whole house is\r\nyours above there,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are its mistress now.\r\nGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill covering her face, she sobbed, and answered \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, dear\r\nPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d and silently ascended. Once she looked back as if she would have\r\nreturned to him, but for fear. It was a momentary thought, too hopeless\r\nto encourage; and her father stood there with the light\xe2\x80\x94hard,\r\nunresponsive, motionless\xe2\x80\x94until the fluttering dress of his fair child\r\nwas lost in the darkness.\r\n\r\nLet him remember it in that room, years to come. The rain that falls\r\nupon the roof: the wind that mourns outside the door: may have\r\nforeknowledge in their melancholy sound. Let him remember it in that\r\nroom, years to come!\r\n\r\nThe last time he had watched her, from the same place, winding up those\r\nstairs, she had had her brother in her arms. It did not move his heart\r\ntowards her now, it steeled it: but he went into his room, and locked\r\nhis door, and sat down in his chair, and cried for his lost boy.\r\n\r\nDiogenes was broad awake upon his post, and waiting for his little\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Di! Oh, dear Di! Love me for his sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiogenes already loved her for her own, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t care how much he\r\nshowed it. So he made himself vastly ridiculous by performing a variety\r\nof uncouth bounces in the ante-chamber, and concluded, when poor\r\nFlorence was at last asleep, and dreaming of the rosy children\r\nopposite, by scratching open her bedroom door: rolling up his bed into\r\na pillow: lying down on the boards, at the full length of his tether,\r\nwith his head towards her: and looking lazily at her, upside down, out\r\nof the tops of his eyes, until from winking and winking he fell asleep\r\nhimself, and dreamed, with gruff barks, of his enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nWalter goes away\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wooden Midshipman at the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s door, like the\r\nhard-hearted little Midshipman he was, remained supremely indifferent\r\nto Walter\xe2\x80\x99s going away, even when the very last day of his sojourn in\r\nthe back parlour was on the decline. With his quadrant at his round\r\nblack knob of an eye, and his figure in its old attitude of indomitable\r\nalacrity, the Midshipman displayed his elfin small-clothes to the best\r\nadvantage, and, absorbed in scientific pursuits, had no sympathy with\r\nworldly concerns. He was so far the creature of circumstances, that a\r\ndry day covered him with dust, and a misty day peppered him with little\r\nbits of soot, and a wet day brightened up his tarnished uniform for the\r\nmoment, and a very hot day blistered him; but otherwise he was a\r\ncallous, obdurate, conceited Midshipman, intent on his own discoveries,\r\nand caring as little for what went on about him, terrestrially, as\r\nArchimedes at the taking of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nSuch a Midshipman he seemed to be, at least, in the then position of\r\ndomestic affairs. Walter eyed him kindly many a time in passing in and\r\nout; and poor old Sol, when Walter was not there, would come and lean\r\nagainst the doorpost, resting his weary wig as near the shoe-buckles of\r\nthe guardian genius of his trade and shop as he could. But no fierce\r\nidol with a mouth from ear to ear, and a murderous visage made of\r\nparrot\xe2\x80\x99s feathers, was ever more indifferent to the appeals of its\r\nsavage votaries, than was the Midshipman to these marks of attachment.\r\n\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s heart felt heavy as he looked round his old bedroom, up among\r\nthe parapets and chimney-pots, and thought that one more night already\r\ndarkening would close his acquaintance with it, perhaps for ever.\r\nDismantled of his little stock of books and pictures, it looked coldly\r\nand reproachfully on him for his desertion, and had already a\r\nforeshadowing upon it of its coming strangeness. \xe2\x80\x9cA few hours more,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cand no dream I ever had here when I was a schoolboy\r\nwill be so little mine as this old room. The dream may come back in my\r\nsleep, and I may return waking to this place, it may be: but the dream\r\nat least will serve no other master, and the room may have a score, and\r\nevery one of them may change, neglect, misuse it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his Uncle was not to be left alone in the little back parlour,\r\nwhere he was then sitting by himself; for Captain Cuttle, considerate\r\nin his roughness, stayed away against his will, purposely that they\r\nshould have some talk together unobserved: so Walter, newly returned\r\nhome from his last day\xe2\x80\x99s bustle, descended briskly, to bear him\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gaily, laying his hand upon the old man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall I send you home from Barbados?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope, my dear Wally. Hope that we shall meet again, on this side of\r\nthe grave. Send me as much of that as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I will, Uncle: I have enough and to spare, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be chary of\r\nit! And as to lively turtles, and limes for Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s punch, and\r\npreserves for you on Sundays, and all that sort of thing, why I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nyou ship-loads, Uncle: when I\xe2\x80\x99m rich enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol wiped his spectacles, and faintly smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, merrily, and clapping him half a\r\ndozen times more upon the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cheer up me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll cheer up\r\nyou! We\xe2\x80\x99ll be as gay as larks to-morrow morning, Uncle, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll fly\r\nas high! As to my anticipations, they are singing out of sight now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWally, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nmy best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your best, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, with his pleasant laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nbest best that I know. You\xe2\x80\x99ll not forget what you\xe2\x80\x99re to send me,\r\nUncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Wally, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man; \xe2\x80\x9ceverything I hear about Miss\r\nDombey, now that she is left alone, poor lamb, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write. I fear it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be much though, Wally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI have just been up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old man, raising his eyebrows, and his\r\nspectacles with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I could have seen her, I\r\ndaresay, if I had asked, Mr Dombey being out of town: but to say a\r\nparting word to Susan. I thought I might venture to do that, you know,\r\nunder the circumstances, and remembering when I saw Miss Dombey last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his Uncle, rousing himself from a temporary\r\nabstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cSusan, I mean: and I told her I was\r\noff and away to-morrow. And I said, Uncle, that you had always had an\r\ninterest in Miss Dombey since that night when she was here, and always\r\nwished her well and happy, and always would be proud and glad to serve\r\nher in the least: I thought I might say that, you know, under the\r\ncircumstances. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his Uncle, in the tone as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I added,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if she\xe2\x80\x94Susan, I mean\xe2\x80\x94could ever\r\nlet you know, either through herself, or Mrs Richards, or anybody else\r\nwho might be coming this way, that Miss Dombey was well and happy, you\r\nwould take it very kindly, and would write so much to me, and I should\r\ntake it very kindly too. There! Upon my word, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nscarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this; and could\r\nnot make up my mind when I was out, whether to do it or not; and yet I\r\nam sure it is the true feeling of my heart, and I should have been\r\nquite miserable afterwards if I had not relieved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis honest voice and manner corroborated what he said, and quite\r\nestablished its ingenuousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, if you ever see her, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean Miss Dombey\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps you may, who knows!\xe2\x80\x94tell her how much I felt for her;\r\nhow much I used to think of her when I was here; how I spoke of her,\r\nwith the tears in my eyes, Uncle, on this last night before I went\r\naway. Tell her that I said I never could forget her gentle manner, or\r\nher beautiful face, or her sweet kind disposition that was better than\r\nall. And as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s feet, or a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s:\r\nonly a little innocent child\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter: \xe2\x80\x9ctell her, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind, Uncle, that I kept those shoes\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll remember how often they\r\nfell off, that night\xe2\x80\x94and took them away with me as a remembrance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were at that very moment going out at the door in one of Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrunks. A porter carrying off his baggage on a truck for shipment at\r\nthe docks on board the Son and Heir, had got possession of them; and\r\nwheeled them away under the very eye of the insensible Midshipman\r\nbefore their owner had well finished speaking.\r\n\r\nBut that ancient mariner might have been excused his insensibility to\r\nthe treasure as it rolled away. For, under his eye at the same moment,\r\naccurately within his range of observation, coming full into the sphere\r\nof his startled and intensely wide-awake look-out, were Florence and\r\nSusan Nipper: Florence looking up into his face half timidly, and\r\nreceiving the whole shock of his wooden ogling!\r\n\r\nMore than this, they passed into the shop, and passed in at the parlour\r\ndoor before they were observed by anybody but the Midshipman. And\r\nWalter, having his back to the door, would have known nothing of their\r\napparition even then, but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own\r\nchair, and nearly tumble over another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Solomon replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, looking round and starting up in his\r\nturn. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy, It was so possible and so actual, that, while the words were on\r\nhis lips, Florence hurried past him; took Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x99s snuff-coloured\r\nlapels, one in each hand; kissed him on the cheek; and turning, gave\r\nher hand to Walter with a simple truth and earnestness that was her\r\nown, and no one else\xe2\x80\x99s in the world!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing away, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, but not so hopefully as he endeavoured:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a voyage before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, looking back at Solomon. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is sorry\r\nyou are going, I am sure. Ah! I see he is! Dear Walter, I am very sorry\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a many we could spare\r\ninstead, if numbers is a object, Mrs Pipchin as a overseer would come\r\ncheap at her weight in gold, and if a knowledge of black slavery should\r\nbe required, them Blimbers is the very people for the sitiwation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Miss Nipper untied her bonnet strings, and after looking\r\nvacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth\r\nwith the usual homely service on the table, shook her head and a tin\r\ncanister, and began unasked to make the tea.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Florence had turned again to the Instrument-maker, who\r\nwas as full of admiration as surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cSo grown!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nimproved! And yet not altered! Just the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned old Sol, rubbing his hands slowly, and considering\r\nthe matter half aloud, as something pensive in the bright eyes looking\r\nat him arrested his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that expression was in the younger\r\nface, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cand what a little\r\ncreature I was then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Instrument-maker, \xe2\x80\x9chow could I\r\nforget you, often as I have thought of you and heard of you since! At\r\nthe very moment, indeed, when you came in, Wally was talking about you\r\nto me, and leaving messages for you, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Walter! Oh thank you, Walter! I\r\nwas afraid you might be going away and hardly thinking of me;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nagain she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that\r\nWalter held it for some moments in his own, and could not bear to let\r\nit go.\r\n\r\nYet Walter did not hold it as he might have held it once, nor did its\r\ntouch awaken those old day-dreams of his boyhood that had floated past\r\nhim sometimes even lately, and confused him with their indistinct and\r\nbroken shapes. The purity and innocence of her endearing manner, and\r\nits perfect trustfulness, and the undisguised regard for him that lay\r\nso deeply seated in her constant eyes, and glowed upon her fair face\r\nthrough the smile that shaded\xe2\x80\x94for alas! it was a smile too sad to\r\nbrighten\xe2\x80\x94it, were not of their romantic race. They brought back to his\r\nthoughts the early death-bed he had seen her tending, and the love the\r\nchild had borne her; and on the wings of such remembrances she seemed\r\nto rise up, far above his idle fancies, into clearer and serener air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid I must call you Walter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence to\r\nthe old man, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cLet you! Good gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe always knew you by that name, and talked of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence,\r\nglancing round, and sighing gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThe nice old parlour! Just the\r\nsame! How well I recollect it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Sol looked first at her, then at his nephew, and then rubbed his\r\nhands, and rubbed his spectacles, and said below his breath, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! time,\r\ntime, time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence; during which Susan Nipper skilfully\r\nimpounded two extra cups and saucers from the cupboard, and awaited the\r\ndrawing of the tea with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell Walter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, laying her hand timidly\r\nupon the old man\xe2\x80\x99s as it rested on the table, to bespeak his attention,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csomething that I am anxious about. He is going to be left alone, and\r\nif he will allow me\xe2\x80\x94not to take Walter\xe2\x80\x99s place, for that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\r\nbut to be his true friend and help him if I ever can while Walter is\r\naway, I shall be very much obliged to him indeed. Will you? May I,\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Instrument-maker, without speaking, put her hand to his lips, and\r\nSusan Nipper, leaning back with her arms crossed, in the chair of\r\npresidency into which she had voted herself, bit one end of her bonnet\r\nstrings, and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will let me come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I can; and you\r\nwill tell me everything about yourself and Walter; and you will have no\r\nsecrets from Susan when she comes and I do not, but will confide in us,\r\nand trust us, and rely upon us. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll try to let us be a comfort\r\nto you? Will you, Walter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sweet face looking into his, the gentle pleading eyes, the soft\r\nvoice, and the light touch on his arm made the more winning by a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s respect and honour for his age, that gave to all an air of\r\ngraceful doubt and modest hesitation\xe2\x80\x94these, and her natural\r\nearnestness, so overcame the poor old Instrument-maker, that he only\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWally! say a word for me, my dear. I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence with her quiet smile. \xe2\x80\x9cSay nothing for\r\nhim, if you please. I understand him very well, and we must learn to\r\ntalk together without you, dear Walter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe regretful tone in which she said these latter words, touched Walter\r\nmore than all the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with an effort to recover the cheerful\r\nmanner he had preserved while talking with his Uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cI know no more\r\nthan my Uncle, what to say in acknowledgment of such kindness, I am\r\nsure. But what could I say, after all, if I had the power of talking\r\nfor an hour, except that it is like you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper began upon a new part of her bonnet string, and nodded at\r\nthe skylight, in approval of the sentiment expressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something that I wish to\r\nsay to you before you go away, and you must call me Florence, if you\r\nplease, and not speak like a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak so. I am\r\nsure, at least, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but that is not enough, and is not what I mean. For, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Florence, bursting into tears, \xe2\x80\x9che liked you very much, and said\r\nbefore he died that he was fond of you, and said \xe2\x80\x98Remember Walter!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a brother to me, Walter, now that he is gone and I have\r\nnone on earth, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your sister all my life, and think of you like\r\none wherever we may be! This is what I wished to say, dear Walter, but\r\nI cannot say it as I would, because my heart is full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in its fulness and its sweet simplicity, she held out both her\r\nhands to him. Walter taking them, stooped down and touched the tearful\r\nface that neither shrunk nor turned away, nor reddened as he did so,\r\nbut looked up at him with confidence and truth. In that one moment,\r\nevery shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from Walter\xe2\x80\x99s soul. It\r\nseemed to him that he responded to her innocent appeal, beside the dead\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s bed: and, in the solemn presence he had seen there, pledged\r\nhimself to cherish and protect her very image, in his banishment, with\r\nbrotherly regard; to garner up her simple faith, inviolate; and hold\r\nhimself degraded if he breathed upon it any thought that was not in her\r\nown breast when she gave it to him.\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper, who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once, and\r\nimparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight, during this\r\ntransaction, now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who\r\ntook sugar; and being enlightened on these points, poured out the tea.\r\nThey all four gathered socially about the little table, and took tea\r\nunder that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s active superintendence; and the presence of\r\nFlorence in the back parlour, brightened the Tartar frigate on the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour ago Walter, for his life, would have hardly called her by\r\nher name. But he could do so now when she entreated him. He could think\r\nof her being there, without a lurking misgiving that it would have been\r\nbetter if she had not come. He could calmly think how beautiful she\r\nwas, how full of promise, what a home some happy man would find in such\r\na heart one day. He could reflect upon his own place in that heart,\r\nwith pride; and with a brave determination, if not to deserve it\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nstill thought that far above him\xe2\x80\x94never to deserve it less.\r\n\r\nSome fairy influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Susan\r\nNipper when she made the tea, engendering the tranquil air that reigned\r\nin the back parlour during its discussion. Some counter-influence must\r\nsurely have hovered round the hands of Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x99s chronometer, and\r\nmoved them faster than the Tartar frigate ever went before the wind. Be\r\nthis as it may, the visitors had a coach in waiting at a quiet corner\r\nnot far off; and the chronometer, on being incidentally referred to,\r\ngave such a positive opinion that it had been waiting a long time, that\r\nit was impossible to doubt the fact, especially when stated on such\r\nunimpeachable authority. If Uncle Sol had been going to be hanged by\r\nhis own time, he never would have allowed that the chronometer was too\r\nfast, by the least fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nFlorence at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said\r\nbefore, and bound him to their compact. Uncle Sol attended her lovingly\r\nto the legs of the wooden Midshipman, and there resigned her to Walter,\r\nwho was ready to escort her and Susan Nipper to the coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence by the way, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been afraid to ask before\r\nyour Uncle. Do you think you will be absent very long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I fear so. Mr Dombey signified as\r\nmuch, I thought, when he appointed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a favour, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, and looking anxiously in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter would have given anything to have answered in the affirmative,\r\nbut his face answered before his lips could, and Florence was too\r\nattentive to it not to understand its reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have scarcely been a favourite with Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Walter, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, understanding what she meant.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many people employed in the House. Between Mr Dombey and a\r\nyoung man like me, there\xe2\x80\x99s a wide space of separation. If I do my duty,\r\nI do what I ought, and do no more than all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad Florence any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious: any\r\nmisgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence\r\nsince that recent night when she had gone down to her father\xe2\x80\x99s room:\r\nthat Walter\xe2\x80\x99s accidental interest in her, and early knowledge of her,\r\nmight have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike? Had\r\nWalter any such idea, or any sudden thought that it was in her mind at\r\nthat moment? Neither of them hinted at it. Neither of them spoke at\r\nall, for some short time. Susan, walking on the other side of Walter,\r\neyed them both sharply; and certainly Miss Nipper\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts travelled\r\nin that direction, and very confidently too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may come back very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps, Walter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may come back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9can old man, and find you an old lady.\r\nBut I hope for better things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\xe2\x80\x94will recover from his\r\ngrief, and\xe2\x80\x94speak more freely to me one day, perhaps; and if he should,\r\nI will tell him how much I wish to see you back again, and ask him to\r\nrecall you for my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a touching modulation in these words about her father, that\r\nWalter understood too well.\r\n\r\nThe coach being close at hand, he would have left her without speaking,\r\nfor now he felt what parting was; but Florence held his hand when she\r\nwas seated, and then he found there was a little packet in her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking full upon him with her affectionate eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clike you, I hope for better things. I will pray for them, and believe\r\nthat they will arrive. I made this little gift for Paul. Pray take it\r\nwith my love, and do not look at it until you are gone away. And now,\r\nGod bless you, Walter! never forget me. You are my brother, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was glad that Susan Nipper came between them, or he might have left\r\nher with a sorrowful remembrance of him. He was glad too that she did\r\nnot look out of the coach again, but waved the little hand to him\r\ninstead, as long as he could see it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her request, he could not help opening the packet that\r\nnight when he went to bed. It was a little purse: and there was money\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nBright rose the sun next morning, from his absence in strange countries\r\nand up rose Walter with it to receive the Captain, who was already at\r\nthe door: having turned out earlier than was necessary, in order to get\r\nunder weigh while Mrs MacStinger was still slumbering. The Captain\r\npretended to be in tip-top spirits, and brought a very smoky tongue in\r\none of the pockets of the broad blue coat for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, when they took their seats at table, if\r\nyour Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s the man I think him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring out the last bottle of\r\nthe Madeira on the present occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! That shall be opened when\r\nWalter comes home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cHear him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it lies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sol Gills, \xe2\x80\x9cdown in the little cellar, covered\r\nwith dirt and cobwebs. There may be dirt and cobwebs over you and me\r\nperhaps, Ned, before it sees the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morality! Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad. Train up\r\na fig-tree in the way it should go, and when you are old sit under the\r\nshade on it. Overhaul the\xe2\x80\x94Well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain on second thoughts,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite certain where that\xe2\x80\x99s to be found, but when found, make a\r\nnote of. Sol Gills, heave ahead again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there or somewhere, it shall lie, Ned, until Wally comes back to\r\nclaim it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I meant to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well said too,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we three don\xe2\x80\x99t crack\r\nthat bottle in company, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you two leave to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s excessive joviality, he made but a poor\r\nhand at the smoky tongue, though he tried very hard, when anybody\r\nlooked at him, to appear as if he were eating with a vast appetite. He\r\nwas terribly afraid, likewise, of being left alone with either Uncle or\r\nnephew; appearing to consider that his only chance of safety as to\r\nkeeping up appearances, was in there being always three together. This\r\nterror on the part of the Captain, reduced him to such ingenious\r\nevasions as running to the door, when Solomon went to put his coat on,\r\nunder pretence of having seen an extraordinary hackney-coach pass: and\r\ndarting out into the road when Walter went upstairs to take leave of\r\nthe lodgers, on a feint of smelling fire in a neighbouring chimney.\r\nThese artifices Captain Cuttle deemed inscrutable by any uninspired\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nWalter was coming down from his parting expedition upstairs, and was\r\ncrossing the shop to go back to the little parlour, when he saw a faded\r\nface he knew, looking in at the door, and darted towards it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, pressing the hand of John Carker the Junior.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray come in! This is kind of you, to be here so early to say good-bye\r\nto me. You knew how glad it would make me to shake hands with you,\r\nonce, before going away. I cannot say how glad I am to have this\r\nopportunity. Pray come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not likely that we may ever meet again, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nother, gently resisting his invitation, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am glad of this\r\nopportunity too. I may venture to speak to you, and to take you by the\r\nhand, on the eve of separation. I shall not have to resist your frank\r\napproaches, Walter, any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy in his smile as he said it, that showed he had\r\nfound some company and friendship for his thoughts even in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr Carker!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you resist them? You could\r\nhave done me nothing but good, I am very sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there were any good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could do on\r\nthis earth, I would do it, Walter, for you. The sight of you from day\r\nto day, has been at once happiness and remorse to me. But the pleasure\r\nhas outweighed the pain. I know that, now, by knowing what I lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Mr Carker, and make acquaintance with my good old Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nurged Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have often talked to him about you, and he will be\r\nglad to tell you all he hears from me. I have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter,\r\nnoticing his hesitation, and speaking with embarrassment himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not told him anything about our last conversation, Mr Carker; not\r\neven him, believe me.\r\n\r\nThe grey Junior pressed his hand, and tears rose in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I ever make acquaintance with him, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cit will\r\nbe that I may hear tidings of you. Rely on my not wronging your\r\nforbearance and consideration. It would be to wrong it, not to tell him\r\nall the truth, before I sought a word of confidence from him. But I\r\nhave no friend or acquaintance except you: and even for your sake, am\r\nlittle likely to make any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had suffered me to be your friend indeed. I\r\nalways wished it, Mr Carker, as you know; but never half so much as\r\nnow, when we are going to part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have been the friend of my\r\nown breast, and that when I have avoided you most, my heart inclined\r\nthe most towards you, and was fullest of you. Walter, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Mr Carker. Heaven be with you, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter with\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, retaining his hand while he spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cif when you\r\ncome back, you miss me from my old corner, and should hear from anyone\r\nwhere I am lying, come and look upon my grave. Think that I might have\r\nbeen as honest and as happy as you! And let me think, when I know time\r\nis coming on, that some one like my former self may stand there, for a\r\nmoment, and remember me with pity and forgiveness! Walter, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis figure crept like a shadow down the bright, sun-lighted street, so\r\ncheerful yet so solemn in the early summer morning; and slowly passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe relentless chronometer at last announced that Walter must turn his\r\nback upon the wooden Midshipman: and away they went, himself, his\r\nUncle, and the Captain, in a hackney-coach to a wharf, where they were\r\nto take steam-boat for some Reach down the river, the name of which, as\r\nthe Captain gave it out, was a hopeless mystery to the ears of\r\nlandsmen. Arrived at this Reach (whither the ship had repaired by last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s tide), they were boarded by various excited watermen, and among\r\nothers by a dirty Cyclops of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, who, with his\r\none eye, had made the Captain out some mile and a half off, and had\r\nbeen exchanging unintelligible roars with him ever since. Becoming the\r\nlawful prize of this personage, who was frightfully hoarse and\r\nconstitutionally in want of shaving, they were all three put aboard the\r\nSon and Heir. And the Son and Heir was in a pretty state of confusion,\r\nwith sails lying all bedraggled on the wet decks, loose ropes tripping\r\npeople up, men in red shirts running barefoot to and fro, casks\r\nblockading every foot of space, and, in the thickest of the fray, a\r\nblack cook in a black caboose up to his eyes in vegetables and blinded\r\nwith smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Captain immediately drew Walter into a corner, and with a great\r\neffort, that made his face very red, pulled up the silver watch, which\r\nwas so big, and so tight in his pocket, that it came out like a bung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, handing it over, and shaking him heartily by\r\nthe hand, \xe2\x80\x9ca parting gift, my lad. Put it back half an hour every\r\nmorning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwatch that\xe2\x80\x99ll do you credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, detaining him,\r\nfor he was running away. \xe2\x80\x9cPray take it back. I have one already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, suddenly diving into one of his\r\npockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar-tongs, with\r\nwhich he had armed himself to meet such an objection, \xe2\x80\x9ctake this here\r\ntrifle of plate, instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand thanks! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthrow them away, Captain Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d for the Captain was about to jerk\r\nthem overboard. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be of much more use to you than me. Give me\r\nyour stick. I have often thought I should like to have it. There!\r\nGood-bye, Captain Cuttle! Take care of my Uncle! Uncle Sol, God bless\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were over the side in the confusion, before Walter caught another\r\nglimpse of either; and when he ran up to the stern, and looked after\r\nthem, he saw his Uncle hanging down his head in the boat, and Captain\r\nCuttle rapping him on the back with the great silver watch (it must\r\nhave been very painful), and gesticulating hopefully with the teaspoons\r\nand sugar-tongs. Catching sight of Walter, Captain Cuttle dropped the\r\nproperty into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern, being\r\nevidently oblivious of its existence, and pulling off the glazed hat\r\nhailed him lustily. The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with\r\nits glistening, and the Captain continued to wave it until he could be\r\nseen no longer. Then the confusion on board, which had been rapidly\r\nincreasing, reached its height; two or three other boats went away with\r\na cheer; the sails shone bright and full above, as Walter watched them\r\nspread their surface to the favourable breeze; the water flew in\r\nsparkles from the prow; and off upon her voyage went the Son and Heir,\r\nas hopefully and trippingly as many another son and heir, gone down,\r\nhad started on his way before her.\r\n\r\nDay after day, old Sol and Captain Cuttle kept her reckoning in the\r\nlittle back parlour and worked out her course, with the chart spread\r\nbefore them on the round table. At night, when old Sol climbed\r\nupstairs, so lonely, to the attic where it sometimes blew great guns,\r\nhe looked up at the stars and listened to the wind, and kept a longer\r\nwatch than would have fallen to his lot on board the ship. The last\r\nbottle of the old Madeira, which had had its cruising days, and known\r\nits dangers of the deep, lay silently beneath its dust and cobwebs, in\r\nthe meanwhile, undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nMr Dombey goes upon a Journey\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Major Bagstock, \xe2\x80\x9cJoey\xe2\x80\x9d B. is not in general a\r\nman of sentiment, for Joseph is tough. But Joe has his feelings, Sir,\r\nand when they are awakened\xe2\x80\x94Damme, Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major with\r\nsudden ferocity, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is weakness, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t submit to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Bagstock delivered himself of these expressions on receiving Mr\r\nDombey as his guest at the head of his own staircase in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace. Mr Dombey had come to breakfast with the Major, previous to\r\ntheir setting forth on their trip; and the ill-starved Native had\r\nalready undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins, while,\r\nin connexion with the general question of boiled eggs, life was a\r\nburden to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for an old soldier of the Bagstock breed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nMajor, relapsing into a mild state, \xe2\x80\x9cto deliver himself up, a prey to\r\nhis own emotions; but\xe2\x80\x94damme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, in another spasm of\r\nferocity, \xe2\x80\x9cI condole with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major\xe2\x80\x99s purple visage deepened in its hue, and the Major\xe2\x80\x99s lobster\r\neyes stood out in bolder relief, as he shook Mr Dombey by the hand,\r\nimparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had\r\nbeen the prelude to his immediately boxing Mr Dombey for a thousand\r\npounds a side and the championship of England. With a rotatory motion\r\nof his head, and a wheeze very like the cough of a horse, the Major\r\nthen conducted his visitor to the sitting-room, and there welcomed him\r\n(having now composed his feelings) with the freedom and frankness of a\r\ntravelling companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to see you.\r\nThere are not many men in Europe to whom J. Bagstock would say that\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nJosh is blunt. Sir: it\xe2\x80\x99s his nature\xe2\x80\x94but Joey B. is proud to see you,\r\nDombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very obliging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cDevil a bit! That\xe2\x80\x99s not my character. If\r\nthat had been Joe\xe2\x80\x99s character, Joe might have been, by this time,\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Joseph Bagstock, K.C.B., and might have received\r\nyou in very different quarters. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know old Joe yet, I find. But\r\nthis occasion, being special, is a source of pride to me. By the Lord,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an honour to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, in his estimation of himself and his money, felt that this\r\nwas very true, and therefore did not dispute the point. But the\r\ninstinctive recognition of such a truth by the Major, and his plain\r\navowal of it, were very able. It was a confirmation to Mr Dombey, if he\r\nhad required any, of his not being mistaken in the Major. It was an\r\nassurance to him that his power extended beyond his own immediate\r\nsphere; and that the Major, as an officer and a gentleman, had a no\r\nless becoming sense of it, than the beadle of the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nAnd if it were ever consolatory to know this, or the like of this, it\r\nwas consolatory then, when the impotence of his will, the instability\r\nof his hopes, the feebleness of wealth, had been so direfully impressed\r\nupon him. What could it do, his boy had asked him. Sometimes, thinking\r\nof the baby question, he could hardly forbear inquiring, himself, what\r\ncould it do indeed: what had it done?\r\n\r\nBut these were lonely thoughts, bred late at night in the sullen\r\ndespondency and gloom of his retirement, and pride easily found its\r\nreassurance in many testimonies to the truth, as unimpeachable and\r\nprecious as the Major\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr Dombey, in his friendlessness, inclined to\r\nthe Major. It cannot be said that he warmed towards him, but he thawed\r\na little, The Major had had some part\xe2\x80\x94and not too much\xe2\x80\x94in the days by\r\nthe seaside. He was a man of the world, and knew some great people. He\r\ntalked much, and told stories; and Mr Dombey was disposed to regard him\r\nas a choice spirit who shone in society, and who had not that poisonous\r\ningredient of poverty with which choice spirits in general are too much\r\nadulterated. His station was undeniable. Altogether the Major was a\r\ncreditable companion, well accustomed to a life of leisure, and to such\r\nplaces as that they were about to visit, and having an air of\r\ngentlemanly ease about him that mixed well enough with his own City\r\ncharacter, and did not compete with it at all. If Mr Dombey had any\r\nlingering idea that the Major, as a man accustomed, in the way of his\r\ncalling, to make light of the ruthless hand that had lately crushed his\r\nhopes, might unconsciously impart some useful philosophy to him, and\r\nscare away his weak regrets, he hid it from himself, and left it lying\r\nat the bottom of his pride, unexamined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, looking wrathfully round the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe Native, who had no particular name, but answered to any\r\nvituperative epithet, presented himself instantly at the door and\r\nventured to come no nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou villain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the choleric Major, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dark servant disappeared in search of it, and was quickly heard\r\nreascending the stairs in such a tremulous state, that the plates and\r\ndishes on the tray he carried, trembling sympathetically as he came,\r\nrattled again, all the way up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, glancing at the Native as he arranged the\r\ntable, and encouraging him with an awful shake of his fist when he\r\nupset a spoon, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a devilled grill, a savoury pie, a dish of\r\nkidneys, and so forth. Pray sit down. Old Joe can give you nothing but\r\ncamp fare, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery excellent fare, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his guest; and not in mere\r\npoliteness either; for the Major always took the best possible care of\r\nhimself, and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for\r\nhim, insomuch that his Imperial complexion was mainly referred by the\r\nfaculty to that circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been looking over the way, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou seen our friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Miss Tox,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming woman, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, with a fat laugh rising in his\r\nshort throat, and nearly suffocating him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox is a very good sort of person, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nThe haughty coldness of the reply seemed to afford Major Bagstock\r\ninfinite delight. He swelled and swelled, exceedingly: and even laid\r\ndown his knife and fork for a moment, to rub his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Joe, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a bit of a favourite in that\r\nquarter once. But Joe has had his day. J. Bagstock is\r\nextinguished\xe2\x80\x94outrivalled\xe2\x80\x94floored, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the lady\xe2\x80\x99s day for\r\nfavourites was over: but perhaps you are jesting, Major.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are jesting, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d was the Major\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder.\r\n\r\nThere never was a more unlikely possibility. It was so clearly\r\nexpressed in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face, that the Major apologised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you are in earnest. I tell you\r\nwhat, Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d The Major paused in his eating, and looked mysteriously\r\nindignant. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a de-vilish ambitious woman, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey said \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d with frigid indifference: mingled perhaps with\r\nsome contemptuous incredulity as to Miss Tox having the presumption to\r\nharbour such a superior quality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cis, in her way, a Lucifer. Joey B.\r\nhas had his day, Sir, but he keeps his eyes. He sees, does Joe. His\r\nRoyal Highness the late Duke of York observed of Joey, at a levee, that\r\nhe saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major accompanied this with such a look, and, between eating,\r\ndrinking, hot tea, devilled grill, muffins, and meaning, was altogether\r\nso swollen and inflamed about the head, that even Mr Dombey showed some\r\nanxiety for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous old spectacle, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Major, \xe2\x80\x9caspires. She\r\naspires sky-high, Sir. Matrimonially, Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major in a warning voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I not, Major?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nThe Major gave no answer but the horse\xe2\x80\x99s cough, and went on eating\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken an interest in your household,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, stopping\r\nshort again, \xe2\x80\x9cand has been a frequent visitor at your house for some\r\ntime now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey with great stateliness, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Tox was\r\noriginally received there, at the time of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s death, as a\r\nfriend of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s; and being a well-behaved person, and showing a\r\nliking for the poor infant, she was permitted\xe2\x80\x94may I say encouraged\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nrepeat her visits with my sister, and gradually to occupy a kind of\r\nfooting of familiarity in the family. I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in the\r\ntone of a man who was making a great and valuable concession, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nrespect for Miss Tox. She has been so obliging as to render many little\r\nservices in my house: trifling and insignificant services perhaps,\r\nMajor, but not to be disparaged on that account: and I hope I have had\r\nthe good fortune to be enabled to acknowledge them by such attention\r\nand notice as it has been in my power to bestow. I hold myself indebted\r\nto Miss Tox, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Dombey, with a slight wave of his hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor the pleasure of your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, warmly: \xe2\x80\x9cno! No, Sir! Joseph Bagstock can\r\nnever permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted. Your knowledge of\r\nold Joe, Sir, such as he is, and old Joe\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of you, Sir, had\r\nits origin in a noble fellow, Sir\xe2\x80\x94in a great creature, Sir. Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Major, with a struggle which it was not very difficult to\r\nparade, his whole life being a struggle against all kinds of apoplectic\r\nsymptoms, \xe2\x80\x9cwe knew each other through your boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey seemed touched, as it is not improbable the Major designed he\r\nshould be, by this allusion. He looked down and sighed: and the Major,\r\nrousing himself fiercely, again said, in reference to the state of mind\r\ninto which he felt himself in danger of falling, that this was\r\nweakness, and nothing should induce him to submit to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend had a remote connexion with that event,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand all the credit that belongs to her, J. B. is willing to give her,\r\nSir. Notwithstanding which, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, raising his eyes from his\r\nplate, and casting them across Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, to where Miss Tox was\r\nat that moment visible at her window watering her flowers, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nscheming jade, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and your ambition is a piece of monstrous\r\nimpudence. If it only made yourself ridiculous, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\nrolling his head at the unconscious Miss Tox, while his starting eyes\r\nappeared to make a leap towards her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might do that to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, without any objection, I assure you, on the part of\r\nBagstock.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the Major laughed frightfully up in the tips of his\r\nears and in the veins of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou compromise other people, and generous, unsuspicious people too, as\r\na repayment for their condescension, you stir the blood of old Joe in\r\nhis body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, reddening, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you do not hint at anything\r\nso absurd on the part of Miss Tox as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cI hint at nothing. But Joey B. has lived\r\nin the world, Sir: lived in the world with his eyes open, Sir, and his\r\nears cocked: and Joe tells you, Dombey, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish artful\r\nand ambitious woman over the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey involuntarily glanced over the way; and an angry glance he\r\nsent in that direction, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all on such a subject that shall pass the lips of Joseph\r\nBagstock,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe is not a tale-bearer, but there\r\nare times when he must speak, when he will speak!\xe2\x80\x94confound your arts,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, again apostrophising his fair neighbour, with\r\ngreat ire,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the provocation is too strong to admit of his\r\nremaining silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe emotion of this outbreak threw the Major into a paroxysm of horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoughs, which held him for a long time. On recovering he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Dombey, as you have invited Joe\xe2\x80\x94old Joe, who has no other\r\nmerit, Sir, but that he is tough and hearty\xe2\x80\x94to be your guest and guide\r\nat Leamington, command him in any way you please, and he is wholly\r\nyours. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, wagging his double chin with\r\na jocose air, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it is you people see in Joe to make you hold him in\r\nsuch great request, all of you; but this I know, Sir, that if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretty tough, and obstinate in his refusals, you\xe2\x80\x99d kill him among you\r\nwith your invitations and so forth, in double-quick time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, in a few words, expressed his sense of the preference he\r\nreceived over those other distinguished members of society who were\r\nclamouring for the possession of Major Bagstock. But the Major cut him\r\nshort by giving him to understand that he followed his own\r\ninclinations, and that they had risen up in a body and said with one\r\naccord, \xe2\x80\x9cJ. B., Dombey is the man for you to choose as a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major being by this time in a state of repletion, with essence of\r\nsavoury pie oozing out at the corners of his eyes, and devilled grill\r\nand kidneys tightening his cravat: and the time moreover approaching\r\nfor the departure of the railway train to Birmingham, by which they\r\nwere to leave town: the Native got him into his great-coat with immense\r\ndifficulty, and buttoned him up until his face looked staring and\r\ngasping, over the top of that garment, as if he were in a barrel. The\r\nNative then handed him separately, and with a decent interval between\r\neach supply, his washleather gloves, his thick stick, and his hat;\r\nwhich latter article the Major wore with a rakish air on one side of\r\nhis head, by way of toning down his remarkable visage. The Native had\r\npreviously packed, in all possible and impossible parts of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchariot, which was in waiting, an unusual quantity of carpet-bags and\r\nsmall portmanteaus, no less apoplectic in appearance than the Major\r\nhimself: and having filled his own pockets with Seltzer water, East\r\nIndia sherry, sandwiches, shawls, telescopes, maps, and newspapers, any\r\nor all of which light baggage the Major might require at any instant of\r\nthe journey, he announced that everything was ready. To complete the\r\nequipment of this unfortunate foreigner (currently believed to be a\r\nprince in his own country), when he took his seat in the rumble by the\r\nside of Mr Towlinson, a pile of the Major\xe2\x80\x99s cloaks and great-coats was\r\nhurled upon him by the landlord, who aimed at him from the pavement\r\nwith those great missiles like a Titan, and so covered him up, that he\r\nproceeded, in a living tomb, to the railroad station.\r\n\r\nBut before the carriage moved away, and while the Native was in the act\r\nof sepulture, Miss Tox appearing at her window, waved a lilywhite\r\nhandkerchief. Mr Dombey received this parting salutation very\r\ncoldly\xe2\x80\x94very coldly even for him\xe2\x80\x94and honouring her with the slightest\r\npossible inclination of his head, leaned back in the carriage with a\r\nvery discontented look. His marked behaviour seemed to afford the Major\r\n(who was all politeness in his recognition of Miss Tox) unbounded\r\nsatisfaction; and he sat for a long time afterwards, leering, and\r\nchoking, like an over-fed Mephistopheles.\r\n\r\nDuring the bustle of preparation at the railway, Mr Dombey and the\r\nMajor walked up and down the platform side by side; the former taciturn\r\nand gloomy, and the latter entertaining him, or entertaining himself,\r\nwith a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences, in most of which Joe\r\nBagstock was the principal performer. Neither of the two observed that\r\nin the course of these walks, they attracted the attention of a working\r\nman who was standing near the engine, and who touched his hat every\r\ntime they passed; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd,\r\nnot at them; and the Major was looking, at the time, into the core of\r\none of his stories. At length, however, this man stepped before them as\r\nthey turned round, and pulling his hat off, and keeping it off, ducked\r\nhis head to Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re a doin\xe2\x80\x99 pretty\r\nwell, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a canvas suit abundantly besmeared with coal-dust and\r\noil, and had cinders in his whiskers, and a smell of half-slaked ashes\r\nall over him. He was not a bad-looking fellow, nor even what could be\r\nfairly called a dirty-looking fellow, in spite of this; and, in short,\r\nhe was Mr Toodle, professionally clothed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the honour of stokin\xe2\x80\x99 of you down, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, Sir.\xe2\x80\x94I hope you find yourself a coming round?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey looked at him, in return for his tone of interest, as if a\r\nman like that would make his very eyesight dirty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Scuse the liberty, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, seeing he was not clearly\r\nremembered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my wife Polly, as was called Richards in your family\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA change in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face, which seemed to express recollection of\r\nhim, and so it did, but it expressed in a much stronger degree an angry\r\nsense of humiliation, stopped Mr Toodle short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife wants money, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, putting his hand in\r\nhis pocket, and speaking (but that he always did) haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say she does. I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was stopped short now in his turn: and awkwardly: with his\r\nhand in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, turning his oilskin cap round and round; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na doin\xe2\x80\x99 pretty well, Sir; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t no cause to complain in the\r\nworldly way, Sir. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had four more since then, Sir, but we rubs on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey would have rubbed on to his own carriage, though in so doing\r\nhe had rubbed the stoker underneath the wheels; but his attention was\r\narrested by something in connexion with the cap still going slowly\r\nround and round in the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lost one babby,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no denyin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLately,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Dombey, looking at the cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir, up\xe2\x80\x99ard of three years ago, but all the rest is hearty. And in\r\nthe matter o readin\xe2\x80\x99, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, ducking again, as if to remind\r\nMr Dombey of what had passed between them on that subject long ago,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthem boys o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, they learned me, among \xe2\x80\x99em, arter all. They\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\na wery tolerable scholar of me, Sir, them boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Major!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Toodle, taking a step before them and\r\ndeferentially stopping them again, still cap in hand: \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ntroubled you with such a pint except as a way of gettin\xe2\x80\x99 in the name of\r\nmy son Biler\xe2\x80\x94christened Robin\xe2\x80\x94him as you was so good as to make a\r\nCharitable Grinder on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey in his severest manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Toodle, shaking his head with a face of great\r\nanxiety and distress, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m forced to say, Sir, that he\xe2\x80\x99s gone wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone wrong, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with a hard kind of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has fell into bad company, you see, genelmen,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the father,\r\nlooking wistfully at both, and evidently taking the Major into the\r\nconversation with the hope of having his sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has got into bad\r\nways. God send he may come to again, genelmen, but he\xe2\x80\x99s on the wrong\r\ntrack now! You could hardly be off hearing of it somehow, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nToodle, again addressing Mr Dombey individually; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s better I\r\nshould out and say my boy\xe2\x80\x99s gone rather wrong. Polly\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful down\r\nabout it, genelmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle with the same dejected look, and\r\nanother appeal to the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA son of this man\xe2\x80\x99s whom I caused to be educated, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nDombey, giving him his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual return!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake advice from plain old Joe, and never educate that sort of people,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir, it never does! It always fails!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simple father was beginning to submit that he hoped his son, the\r\nquondam Grinder, huffed and cuffed, and flogged and badged, and taught,\r\nas parrots are, by a brute jobbed into his place of schoolmaster with\r\nas much fitness for it as a hound, might not have been educated on\r\nquite a right plan in some undiscovered respect, when Mr Dombey angrily\r\nrepeating \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual return!\xe2\x80\x9d led the Major away. And the Major being\r\nheavy to hoist into Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, elevated in mid-air, and\r\nhaving to stop and swear that he would flay the Native alive, and break\r\nevery bone in his skin, and visit other physical torments upon him,\r\nevery time he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get his foot on the step, and fell back on that\r\ndark exile, had barely time before they started to repeat hoarsely that\r\nit would never do: that it always failed: and that if he were to\r\neducate \xe2\x80\x9chis own vagabond,\xe2\x80\x9d he would certainly be hanged.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey assented bitterly; but there was something more in his\r\nbitterness, and in his moody way of falling back in the carriage, and\r\nlooking with knitted brows at the changing objects without, than the\r\nfailure of that noble educational system administered by the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCompany. He had seen upon the man\xe2\x80\x99s rough cap a piece of new crape, and\r\nhe had assured himself, from his manner and his answers, that he wore\r\nit for _his_ son.\r\n\r\nSo! from high to low, at home or abroad, from Florence in his great\r\nhouse to the coarse churl who was feeding the fire then smoking before\r\nthem, everyone set up some claim or other to a share in his dead boy,\r\nand was a bidder against him! Could he ever forget how that woman had\r\nwept over his pillow, and called him her own child! or how he, waking\r\nfrom his sleep, had asked for her, and had raised himself in his bed\r\nand brightened when she came in!\r\n\r\nTo think of this presumptuous raker among coals and ashes going on\r\nbefore there, with his sign of mourning! To think that he dared to\r\nenter, even by a common show like that, into the trial and\r\ndisappointment of a proud gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s secret heart! To think that this\r\nlost child, who was to have divided with him his riches, and his\r\nprojects, and his power, and allied with whom he was to have shut out\r\nall the world as with a double door of gold, should have let in such a\r\nherd to insult him with their knowledge of his defeated hopes, and\r\ntheir boasts of claiming community of feeling with himself, so far\r\nremoved: if not of having crept into the place wherein he would have\r\nlorded it, alone!\r\n\r\nHe found no pleasure or relief in the journey. Tortured by these\r\nthoughts he carried monotony with him, through the rushing landscape,\r\nand hurried headlong, not through a rich and varied country, but a\r\nwilderness of blighted plans and gnawing jealousies. The very speed at\r\nwhich the train was whirled along, mocked the swift course of the young\r\nlife that had been borne away so steadily and so inexorably to its\r\nforedoomed end. The power that forced itself upon its iron way\xe2\x80\x94its\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94defiant of all paths and roads, piercing through the heart of every\r\nobstacle, and dragging living creatures of all classes, ages, and\r\ndegrees behind it, was a type of the triumphant monster, Death.\r\n\r\nAway, with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle, from the town, burrowing\r\namong the dwellings of men and making the streets hum, flashing out\r\ninto the meadows for a moment, mining in through the damp earth,\r\nbooming on in darkness and heavy air, bursting out again into the sunny\r\nday so bright and wide; away, with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle,\r\nthrough the fields, through the woods, through the corn, through the\r\nhay, through the chalk, through the mould, through the clay, through\r\nthe rock, among objects close at hand and almost in the grasp, ever\r\nflying from the traveller, and a deceitful distance ever moving slowly\r\nwithin him: like as in the track of the remorseless monster, Death!\r\n\r\nThrough the hollow, on the height, by the heath, by the orchard, by the\r\npark, by the garden, over the canal, across the river, where the sheep\r\nare feeding, where the mill is going, where the barge is floating,\r\nwhere the dead are lying, where the factory is smoking, where the\r\nstream is running, where the village clusters, where the great\r\ncathedral rises, where the bleak moor lies, and the wild breeze smooths\r\nor ruffles it at its inconstant will; away, with a shriek, and a roar,\r\nand a rattle, and no trace to leave behind but dust and vapour: like as\r\nin the track of the remorseless monster, Death!\r\n\r\nBreasting the wind and light, the shower and sunshine, away, and still\r\naway, it rolls and roars, fierce and rapid, smooth and certain, and\r\ngreat works and massive bridges crossing up above, fall like a beam of\r\nshadow an inch broad, upon the eye, and then are lost. Away, and still\r\naway, onward and onward ever: glimpses of cottage-homes, of houses,\r\nmansions, rich estates, of husbandry and handicraft, of people, of old\r\nroads and paths that look deserted, small, and insignificant as they\r\nare left behind: and so they do, and what else is there but such\r\nglimpses, in the track of the indomitable monster, Death!\r\n\r\nAway, with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle, plunging down into the\r\nearth again, and working on in such a storm of energy and perseverance,\r\nthat amidst the darkness and whirlwind the motion seems reversed, and\r\nto tend furiously backward, until a ray of light upon the wet wall\r\nshows its surface flying past like a fierce stream. Away once more into\r\nthe day, and through the day, with a shrill yell of exultation,\r\nroaring, rattling, tearing on, spurning everything with its dark\r\nbreath, sometimes pausing for a minute where a crowd of faces are, that\r\nin a minute more are not; sometimes lapping water greedily, and before\r\nthe spout at which it drinks has ceased to drip upon the ground,\r\nshrieking, roaring, rattling through the purple distance!\r\n\r\nLouder and louder yet, it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on\r\nresistless to the goal: and now its way, still like the way of Death,\r\nis strewn with ashes thickly. Everything around is blackened. There are\r\ndark pools of water, muddy lanes, and miserable habitations far below.\r\nThere are jagged walls and falling houses close at hand, and through\r\nthe battered roofs and broken windows, wretched rooms are seen, where\r\nwant and fever hide themselves in many wretched shapes, while smoke and\r\ncrowded gables, and distorted chimneys, and deformity of brick and\r\nmortar penning up deformity of mind and body, choke the murky distance.\r\nAs Mr Dombey looks out of his carriage window, it is never in his\r\nthoughts that the monster who has brought him there has let the light\r\nof day in on these things: not made or caused them. It was the\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s fitting end, and might have been the end of everything; it\r\nwas so ruinous and dreary.\r\n\r\nSo, pursuing the one course of thought, he had the one relentless\r\nmonster still before him. All things looked black, and cold, and deadly\r\nupon him, and he on them. He found a likeness to his misfortune\r\neverywhere. There was a remorseless triumph going on about him, and it\r\ngalled and stung him in his pride and jealousy, whatever form it took:\r\nthough most of all when it divided with him the love and memory of his\r\nlost boy.\r\n\r\nThere was a face\xe2\x80\x94he had looked upon it, on the previous night, and it\r\non him with eyes that read his soul, though they were dim with tears,\r\nand hidden soon behind two quivering hands\xe2\x80\x94that often had attended him\r\nin fancy, on this ride. He had seen it, with the expression of last\r\nnight, timidly pleading to him. It was not reproachful, but there was\r\nsomething of doubt, almost of hopeful incredulity in it, which, as he\r\nonce more saw that fade away into a desolate certainty of his dislike,\r\nwas like reproach. It was a trouble to him to think of this face of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nBecause he felt any new compunction towards it? No. Because the feeling\r\nit awakened in him\xe2\x80\x94of which he had had some old foreshadowing in older\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94was full-formed now, and spoke out plainly, moving him too much,\r\nand threatening to grow too strong for his composure. Because the face\r\nwas abroad, in the expression of defeat and persecution that seemed to\r\nencircle him like the air. Because it barbed the arrow of that cruel\r\nand remorseless enemy on which his thoughts so ran, and put into its\r\ngrasp a double-handed sword. Because he knew full well, in his own\r\nbreast, as he stood there, tinging the scene of transition before him\r\nwith the morbid colours of his own mind, and making it a ruin and a\r\npicture of decay, instead of hopeful change, and promise of better\r\nthings, that life had quite as much to do with his complainings as\r\ndeath. One child was gone, and one child left. Why was the object of\r\nhis hope removed instead of her?\r\n\r\nThe sweet, calm, gentle presence in his fancy, moved him to no\r\nreflection but that. She had been unwelcome to him from the first; she\r\nwas an aggravation of his bitterness now. If his son had been his only\r\nchild, and the same blow had fallen on him, it would have been heavy to\r\nbear; but infinitely lighter than now, when it might have fallen on her\r\n(whom he could have lost, or he believed it, without a pang), and had\r\nnot. Her loving and innocent face rising before him, had no softening\r\nor winning influence. He rejected the angel, and took up with the\r\ntormenting spirit crouching in his bosom. Her patience, goodness,\r\nyouth, devotion, love, were as so many atoms in the ashes upon which he\r\nset his heel. He saw her image in the blight and blackness all around\r\nhim, not irradiating but deepening the gloom. More than once upon this\r\njourney, and now again as he stood pondering at this journey\xe2\x80\x99s end,\r\ntracing figures in the dust with his stick, the thought came into his\r\nmind, what was there he could interpose between himself and it?\r\n\r\nThe Major, who had been blowing and panting all the way down, like\r\nanother engine, and whose eye had often wandered from his newspaper to\r\nleer at the prospect, as if there were a procession of discomfited Miss\r\nToxes pouring out in the smoke of the train, and flying away over the\r\nfields to hide themselves in any place of refuge, aroused his friends\r\nby informing him that the post-horses were harnessed and the carriage\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, rapping him on the arm with his cane, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe thoughtful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad habit, Old Joe, Sir, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as tough as\r\nyou see him, if he had ever encouraged it. You are too great a man,\r\nDombey, to be thoughtful. In your position, Sir, you\xe2\x80\x99re far above that\r\nkind of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major even in his friendly remonstrances, thus consulting the\r\ndignity and honour of Mr Dombey, and showing a lively sense of their\r\nimportance, Mr Dombey felt more than ever disposed to defer to a\r\ngentleman possessing so much good sense and such a well-regulated mind;\r\naccordingly he made an effort to listen to the Major\xe2\x80\x99s stories, as they\r\ntrotted along the turnpike road; and the Major, finding both the pace\r\nand the road a great deal better adapted to his conversational powers\r\nthan the mode of travelling they had just relinquished, came out of his\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nBut still the Major, blunt and tough as he was, and as he so very often\r\nsaid he was, administered some palatable catering to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappetite. He related, or rather suffered it to escape him,\r\naccidentally, and as one might say, grudgingly and against his will,\r\nhow there was great curiosity and excitement at the club, in regard of\r\nhis friend Dombey. How he was suffocated with questions, Sir. How old\r\nJoe Bagstock was a greater man than ever, there, on the strength of\r\nDombey. How they said, \xe2\x80\x9cBagstock, your friend Dombey now, what is the\r\nview he takes of such and such a question? Though, by the Rood, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Major, with a broad stare, \xe2\x80\x9chow they discovered that J. B.\r\never came to know you, is a mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this flow of spirits and conversation, only interrupted by his usual\r\nplethoric symptoms, and by intervals of lunch, and from time to time by\r\nsome violent assault upon the Native, who wore a pair of ear-rings in\r\nhis dark-brown ears, and on whom his European clothes sat with an\r\noutlandish impossibility of adjustment\xe2\x80\x94being, of their own accord, and\r\nwithout any reference to the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s art, long where they ought to be\r\nshort, short where they ought to be long, tight where they ought to be\r\nloose, and loose where they ought to be tight\xe2\x80\x94and to which he imparted\r\na new grace, whenever the Major attacked him, by shrinking into them\r\nlike a shrivelled nut, or a cold monkey\xe2\x80\x94in this flow of spirits and\r\nconversation, the Major continued all day: so that when evening came\r\non, and found them trotting through the green and leafy road near\r\nLeamington, the Major\xe2\x80\x99s voice, what with talking and eating and\r\nchuckling and choking, appeared to be in the box under the rumble, or\r\nin some neighbouring hay-stack. Nor did the Major improve it at the\r\nRoyal Hotel, where rooms and dinner had been ordered, and where he so\r\noppressed his organs of speech by eating and drinking, that when he\r\nretired to bed he had no voice at all, except to cough with, and could\r\nonly make himself intelligible to the dark servant by gasping at him.\r\n\r\nHe not only rose next morning, however, like a giant refreshed, but\r\nconducted himself, at breakfast like a giant refreshing. At this meal\r\nthey arranged their daily habits. The Major was to take the\r\nresponsibility of ordering everything to eat and drink; and they were\r\nto have a late breakfast together every morning, and a late dinner\r\ntogether every day. Mr Dombey would prefer remaining in his own room,\r\nor walking in the country by himself, on that first day of their\r\nsojourn at Leamington; but next morning he would be happy to accompany\r\nthe Major to the Pump-room, and about the town. So they parted until\r\ndinner-time. Mr Dombey retired to nurse his wholesome thoughts in his\r\nown way. The Major, attended by the Native carrying a camp-stool, a\r\ngreat-coat, and an umbrella, swaggered up and down through all the\r\npublic places: looking into subscription books to find out who was\r\nthere, looking up old ladies by whom he was much admired, reporting J.\r\nB. tougher than ever, and puffing his rich friend Dombey wherever he\r\nwent. There never was a man who stood by a friend more staunchly than\r\nthe Major, when in puffing him, he puffed himself.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how much new conversation the Major had to let off at\r\ndinner-time, and what occasion he gave Mr Dombey to admire his social\r\nqualities. At breakfast next morning, he knew the contents of the\r\nlatest newspapers received; and mentioned several subjects in connexion\r\nwith them, on which his opinion had recently been sought by persons of\r\nsuch power and might, that they were only to be obscurely hinted at. Mr\r\nDombey, who had been so long shut up within himself, and who had\r\nrarely, at any time, overstepped the enchanted circle within which the\r\noperations of Dombey and Son were conducted, began to think this an\r\nimprovement on his solitary life; and in place of excusing himself for\r\nanother day, as he had thought of doing when alone, walked out with the\r\nMajor arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nNew Faces\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MAJOR, more blue-faced and staring\xe2\x80\x94more over-ripe, as it were, than\r\never\xe2\x80\x94and giving vent, every now and then, to one of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s coughs,\r\nnot so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance,\r\nwalked arm-in-arm with Mr Dombey up the sunny side of the way, with his\r\ncheeks swelling over his tight stock, his legs majestically wide apart,\r\nand his great head wagging from side to side, as if he were\r\nremonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object. They\r\nhad not walked many yards, before the Major encountered somebody he\r\nknew, nor many yards farther before the Major encountered somebody else\r\nhe knew, but he merely shook his fingers at them as he passed, and led\r\nMr Dombey on: pointing out the localities as they went, and enlivening\r\nthe walk with any current scandal suggested by them.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Major and Mr Dombey were walking arm-in-arm, much to\r\ntheir own satisfaction, when they beheld advancing towards them, a\r\nwheeled chair, in which a lady was seated, indolently steering her\r\ncarriage by a kind of rudder in front, while it was propelled by some\r\nunseen power in the rear. Although the lady was not young, she was very\r\nblooming in the face\xe2\x80\x94quite rosy\xe2\x80\x94and her dress and attitude were\r\nperfectly juvenile. Walking by the side of the chair, and carrying her\r\ngossamer parasol with a proud and weary air, as if so great an effort\r\nmust be soon abandoned and the parasol dropped, sauntered a much\r\nyounger lady, very handsome, very haughty, very wilful, who tossed her\r\nhead and drooped her eyelids, as though, if there were anything in all\r\nthe world worth looking into, save a mirror, it certainly was not the\r\nearth or sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the devil have we here, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, stopping as\r\nthis little cavalcade drew near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d drawled the lady in the chair, \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Bagstock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major no sooner heard the voice, than he relinquished Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, darted forward, took the hand of the lady in the chair and pressed\r\nit to his lips. With no less gallantry, the Major folded both his\r\ngloves upon his heart, and bowed low to the other lady. And now, the\r\nchair having stopped, the motive power became visible in the shape of a\r\nflushed page pushing behind, who seemed to have in part outgrown and in\r\npart out-pushed his strength, for when he stood upright he was tall,\r\nand wan, and thin, and his plight appeared the more forlorn from his\r\nhaving injured the shape of his hat, by butting at the carriage with\r\nhis head to urge it forward, as is sometimes done by elephants in\r\nOriental countries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe Bagstock,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major to both ladies, \xe2\x80\x9cis a proud and happy\r\nman for the rest of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou false creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady in the chair, insipidly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\ndo you come from? I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen suffer old Joe to present a friend, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\npromptly, \xe2\x80\x9cas a reason for being tolerated. Mr Dombey, Mrs Skewton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe lady in the chair was gracious. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey, Mrs Granger.\xe2\x80\x9d The lady\r\nwith the parasol was faintly conscious of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s taking off his\r\nhat, and bowing low. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cto have\r\nthis opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Major seemed in earnest, for he looked at all the three, and leered\r\nin his ugliest manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Skewton, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes havoc in the heart of old\r\nJosh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey signified that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou perfidious goblin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady in the chair, \xe2\x80\x9chave done! How\r\nlong have you been here, bad man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you be a day, or even a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady, slightly\r\nsettling her false curls and false eyebrows with her fan, and showing\r\nher false teeth, set off by her false complexion, \xe2\x80\x9cin the garden of\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s-its-name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEden, I suppose, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the younger lady, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help it. I never can\r\nremember those frightful names\xe2\x80\x94without having your whole Soul and Being\r\ninspired by the sight of Nature; by the perfume,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton,\r\nrustling a handkerchief that was faint and sickly with essences, \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\nher artless breath, you creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s fresh enthusiasm of words, and\r\nforlornly faded manner, was hardly less observable than that between\r\nher age, which was about seventy, and her dress, which would have been\r\nyouthful for twenty-seven. Her attitude in the wheeled chair (which she\r\nnever varied) was one in which she had been taken in a barouche, some\r\nfifty years before, by a then fashionable artist who had appended to\r\nhis published sketch the name of Cleopatra: in consequence of a\r\ndiscovery made by the critics of the time, that it bore an exact\r\nresemblance to that Princess as she reclined on board her galley. Mrs\r\nSkewton was a beauty then, and bucks threw wine-glasses over their\r\nheads by dozens in her honour. The beauty and the barouche had both\r\npassed away, but she still preserved the attitude, and for this reason\r\nexpressly, maintained the wheeled chair and the butting page: there\r\nbeing nothing whatever, except the attitude, to prevent her from\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey is devoted to Nature, I trust?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, settling\r\nher diamond brooch. And by the way, she chiefly lived upon the\r\nreputation of some diamonds, and her family connexions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Dombey, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be devoted to her\r\nin secret, but a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the\r\nuniverse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can be a stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cto Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s immense\r\ninfluence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr Dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head, the\r\nyounger lady glancing at him, met his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou reside here, Madam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, addressing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we have been to a great many places. To Harrogate and Scarborough,\r\nand into Devonshire. We have been visiting, and resting here and there.\r\nMama likes change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith of course does not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, with a ghastly archness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not found that there is any change in such places,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nanswer, delivered with supreme indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey libel me. There is only one change, Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs\r\nSkewton, with a mincing sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cfor which I really care, and that I fear\r\nI shall never be permitted to enjoy. People cannot spare one. But\r\nseclusion and contemplation are my what-his-name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean Paradise, Mama, you had better say so, to render yourself\r\nintelligible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that I am wholly\r\ndependent upon you for those odious names. I assure you, Mr Dombey,\r\nNature intended me for an Arcadian. I am thrown away in society. Cows\r\nare my passion. What I have ever sighed for, has been to retreat to a\r\nSwiss farm, and live entirely surrounded by cows\xe2\x80\x94and china.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis curious association of objects, suggesting a remembrance of the\r\ncelebrated bull who got by mistake into a crockery shop, was received\r\nwith perfect gravity by Mr Dombey, who intimated his opinion that\r\nNature was, no doubt, a very respectable institution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled Mrs Skewton, pinching her shrivelled throat, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d It was frightfully true in one sense, if not in that in which\r\nshe used the phrase. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want, is frankness, confidence, less\r\nconventionality, and freer play of soul. We are so dreadfully\r\nartificial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were, indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cI want Nature everywhere. It would be so\r\nextremely charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNature is inviting us away now, Mama, if you are ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyounger lady, curling her handsome lip. At this hint, the wan page, who\r\nhad been surveying the party over the top of the chair, vanished behind\r\nit, as if the ground had swallowed him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a moment, Withers!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, as the chair began to move;\r\ncalling to the page with all the languid dignity with which she had\r\ncalled in days of yore to a coachman with a wig, cauliflower nosegay,\r\nand silk stockings. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you staying, abomination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major was staying at the Royal Hotel, with his friend Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may come and see us any evening when you are good,\xe2\x80\x9d lisped Mrs\r\nSkewton. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr Dombey will honour us, we shall be happy. Withers, go\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major again pressed to his blue lips the tips of the fingers that\r\nwere disposed on the ledge of the wheeled chair with careful\r\ncarelessness, after the Cleopatra model: and Mr Dombey bowed. The elder\r\nlady honoured them both with a very gracious smile and a girlish wave\r\nof her hand; the younger lady with the very slightest inclination of\r\nher head that common courtesy allowed.\r\n\r\nThe last glimpse of the wrinkled face of the mother, with that patched\r\ncolour on it which the sun made infinitely more haggard and dismal than\r\nany want of colour could have been, and of the proud beauty of the\r\ndaughter with her graceful figure and erect deportment, engendered such\r\nan involuntary disposition on the part of both the Major and Mr Dombey\r\nto look after them, that they both turned at the same moment. The Page,\r\nnearly as much aslant as his own shadow, was toiling after the chair,\r\nuphill, like a slow battering-ram; the top of Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet was\r\nfluttering in exactly the same corner to the inch as before; and the\r\nBeauty, loitering by herself a little in advance, expressed in all her\r\nelegant form, from head to foot, the same supreme disregard of\r\neverything and everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, as they resumed their walk\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Joe Bagstock were a younger man, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a woman in the\r\nworld whom he\xe2\x80\x99d prefer for Mrs Bagstock to that woman. By George, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s superb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Joey B. a turnip, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he should mean the\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were complimentary to the mother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ancient flame, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Major Bagstock. \xe2\x80\x9cDevilish ancient. I\r\nhumour her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe impresses me as being perfectly genteel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenteel, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, stopping short, and staring in his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Honourable Mrs Skewton, Sir, is sister to the\r\nlate Lord Feenix, and aunt to the present Lord. The family are not\r\nwealthy\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re poor, indeed\xe2\x80\x94and she lives upon a small jointure; but\r\nif you come to blood, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d The Major gave a flourish with his stick\r\nand walked on again, in despair of being able to say what you came to,\r\nif you came to that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou addressed the daughter, I observed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, after a short\r\npause, \xe2\x80\x9cas Mrs Granger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith Skewton, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, stopping short again, and\r\npunching a mark in the ground with his cane, to represent her, \xe2\x80\x9cmarried\r\n(at eighteen) Granger of Ours;\xe2\x80\x9d whom the Major indicated by another\r\npunch. \xe2\x80\x9cGranger, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, tapping the last ideal portrait,\r\nand rolling his head emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cwas Colonel of Ours; a de-vilish\r\nhandsome fellow, Sir, of forty-one. He died, Sir, in the second year of\r\nhis marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d The Major ran the representative of the deceased Granger\r\nthrough and through the body with his walking-stick, and went on again,\r\ncarrying his stick over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is this ago?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey, making another halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith Granger, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Major, shutting one eye, putting his\r\nhead on one side, passing his cane into his left hand, and smoothing\r\nhis shirt-frill with his right, \xe2\x80\x9cis, at this present time, not quite\r\nthirty. And damme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, shouldering his stick once\r\nmore, and walking on again, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a peerless woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there any family?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sought the ground, and a shade came over his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was drowned, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a child of four or\r\nfive years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, raising his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have\r\nput him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his history. Edith Granger is Edith\r\nGranger still; but if tough old Joey B., Sir, were a little younger and\r\na little richer, the name of that immortal paragon should be Bagstock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major heaved his shoulders, and his cheeks, and laughed more like\r\nan over-fed Mephistopheles than ever, as he said the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvided the lady made no objection, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bagstock breed are not accustomed\r\nto that sort of obstacle. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s true enough that Edith might have\r\nmarried twenty times, but for being proud, Sir, proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey seemed, by his face, to think no worse of her for that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great quality after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhigh quality! Dombey! You are proud yourself, and your friend, Old Joe,\r\nrespects you for it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this tribute to the character of his ally, which seemed to be\r\nwrung from him by the force of circumstances and the irresistible\r\ntendency of their conversation, the Major closed the subject, and\r\nglided into a general exposition of the extent to which he had been\r\nbeloved and doted on by splendid women and brilliant creatures.\r\n\r\nOn the next day but one, Mr Dombey and the Major encountered the\r\nHonourable Mrs Skewton and her daughter in the Pump-room; on the day\r\nafter, they met them again very near the place where they had met them\r\nfirst. After meeting them thus, three or four times in all, it became a\r\npoint of mere civility to old acquaintances that the Major should go\r\nthere one evening. Mr Dombey had not originally intended to pay visits,\r\nbut on the Major announcing this intention, he said he would have the\r\npleasure of accompanying him. So the Major told the Native to go round\r\nbefore dinner, and say, with his and Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, that they\r\nwould have the honour of visiting the ladies that same evening, if the\r\nladies were alone. In answer to which message, the Native brought back\r\na very small note with a very large quantity of scent about it, indited\r\nby the Honourable Mrs Skewton to Major Bagstock, and briefly saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a shocking bear and I have a great mind not to forgive you,\r\nbut if you are very good indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d which was underlined, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may come.\r\nCompliments (in which Edith unites) to Mr Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Mrs Skewton and her daughter, Mrs Granger, resided,\r\nwhile at Leamington, in lodgings that were fashionable enough and dear\r\nenough, but rather limited in point of space and conveniences; so that\r\nthe Honourable Mrs Skewton, being in bed, had her feet in the window\r\nand her head in the fireplace, while the Honourable Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s maid\r\nwas quartered in a closet within the drawing-room, so extremely small,\r\nthat, to avoid developing the whole of its accommodations, she was\r\nobliged to writhe in and out of the door like a beautiful serpent.\r\nWithers, the wan page, slept out of the house immediately under the\r\ntiles at a neighbouring milk-shop; and the wheeled chair, which was the\r\nstone of that young Sisyphus, passed the night in a shed belonging to\r\nthe same dairy, where new-laid eggs were produced by the poultry\r\nconnected with the establishment, who roosted on a broken donkey-cart,\r\npersuaded, to all appearance, that it grew there, and was a species of\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey and the Major found Mrs Skewton arranged, as Cleopatra, among\r\nthe cushions of a sofa: very airily dressed; and certainly not\r\nresembling Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Cleopatra, whom age could not wither. On their\r\nway upstairs they had heard the sound of a harp, but it had ceased on\r\ntheir being announced, and Edith now stood beside it handsomer and\r\nhaughtier than ever. It was a remarkable characteristic of this lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeauty that it appeared to vaunt and assert itself without her aid, and\r\nagainst her will. She knew that she was beautiful: it was impossible\r\nthat it could be otherwise: but she seemed with her own pride to defy\r\nher very self.\r\n\r\nWhether she held cheap attractions that could only call forth\r\nadmiration that was worthless to her, or whether she designed to render\r\nthem more precious to admirers by this usage of them, those to whom\r\nthey were precious seldom paused to consider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Mrs Granger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, advancing a step towards her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe are not the cause of your ceasing to play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! oh no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not go on then, my dearest Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left off as I began\xe2\x80\x94of my own fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this: an\r\nindifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility, for it was\r\npointed with proud purpose: was well set off by the carelessness with\r\nwhich she drew her hand across the strings, and came from that part of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said her languishing mother, playing with a\r\nhand-screen, \xe2\x80\x9cthat occasionally my dearest Edith and myself actually\r\nalmost differ\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite, sometimes, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh never quite, my darling! Fie, fie, it would break my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned her mother, making a faint attempt to pat her with the screen,\r\nwhich Edith made no movement to meet, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94about these old\r\nconventionalities of manner that are observed in little things? Why are\r\nwe not more natural? Dear me! With all those yearnings, and gushings,\r\nand impulsive throbbings that we have implanted in our souls, and which\r\nare so very charming, why are we not more natural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey said it was very true, very true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could be more natural I suppose if we tried?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey thought it possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil a bit, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. Unless\r\nthe world was peopled with J.B.\xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x94tough and blunt old Joes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nplain red herrings with hard roes, Sir\xe2\x80\x94we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty Infidel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cbe mute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCleopatra commands,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, kissing his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cand Antony\r\nBagstock obeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man has no sensitiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, cruelly holding up\r\nthe hand-screen so as to shut the Major out. \xe2\x80\x9cNo sympathy. And what do\r\nwe live for but sympathy! What else is so extremely charming! Without\r\nthat gleam of sunshine on our cold cold earth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton,\r\narranging her lace tucker, and complacently observing the effect of her\r\nbare lean arm, looking upward from the wrist, \xe2\x80\x9chow could we possibly\r\nbear it? In short, obdurate man!\xe2\x80\x9d glancing at the Major, round the\r\nscreen, \xe2\x80\x9cI would have my world all heart; and Faith is so excessively\r\ncharming, that I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to disturb it, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major replied that it was hard in Cleopatra to require the world to\r\nbe all heart, and yet to appropriate to herself the hearts of all the\r\nworld; which obliged Cleopatra to remind him that flattery was\r\ninsupportable to her, and that if he had the boldness to address her in\r\nthat strain any more, she would positively send him home.\r\n\r\nWithers the Wan, at this period, handing round the tea, Mr Dombey again\r\naddressed himself to Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much company here, it would seem?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in his\r\nown portentous gentlemanly way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not. We see none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy really,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Skewton from her couch, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no people\r\nhere just now with whom we care to associate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not enough heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, with a smile. The very\r\ntwilight of a smile: so singularly were its light and darkness blended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith rallies me, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, shaking her\r\nhead: which shook a little of itself sometimes, as if the palsy\r\ntwinkled now and then in opposition to the diamonds. \xe2\x80\x9cWicked one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been here before, if I am not mistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\nStill to Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, several times. I think we have been everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful country!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is. Everybody says so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin Feenix raves about it, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed her mother from\r\nher couch.\r\n\r\nThe daughter slightly turned her graceful head, and raising her\r\neyebrows by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth, as if her cousin Feenix were of all the\r\nmortal world the least to be regarded, turned her eyes again towards Mr\r\nDombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, for the credit of my good taste, that I am tired of the\r\nneighbourhood,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have almost reason to be, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, glancing at a\r\nvariety of landscape drawings, of which he had already recognised\r\nseveral as representing neighbouring points of view, and which were\r\nstrewn abundantly about the room, \xe2\x80\x9cif these beautiful productions are\r\nfrom your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him no reply, but sat in a disdainful beauty, quite amazing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they that interest?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you play, I already know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered all these questions with a strange reluctance; and with\r\nthat remarkable air of opposition to herself, already noticed as\r\nbelonging to her beauty. Yet she was not embarrassed, but wholly\r\nself-possessed. Neither did she seem to wish to avoid the conversation,\r\nfor she addressed her face, and\xe2\x80\x94so far as she could\xe2\x80\x94her manner also, to\r\nhim; and continued to do so, when he was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have many resources against weariness at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever their efficiency may be,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know them all\r\nnow. I have no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I hope to prove them all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with solemn gallantry,\r\nlaying down a drawing he had held, and motioning towards the harp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh certainly! If you desire it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose as she spoke, and crossing by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s couch, and\r\ndirecting a stately look towards her, which was instantaneous in its\r\nduration, but inclusive (if anyone had seen it) of a multitude of\r\nexpressions, among which that of the twilight smile, without the smile\r\nitself, overshadowed all the rest, went out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Major, who was quite forgiven by this time, had wheeled a little\r\ntable up to Cleopatra, and was sitting down to play picquet with her.\r\nMr Dombey, not knowing the game, sat down to watch them for his\r\nedification until Edith should return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have some music, Mr Dombey, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Granger has been kind enough to promise so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That\xe2\x80\x99s very nice. Do you propose, Major?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a barbarous being,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cand my hand\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed.\r\nYou are fond of music, Mr Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEminently so,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, looking at her cards. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nheart in it\xe2\x80\x94undeveloped recollections of a previous state of\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94and all that\xe2\x80\x94which is so truly charming. Do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsimpered Cleopatra, reversing the knave of clubs, who had come into her\r\ngame with his heels uppermost, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if anything could tempt me to put\r\na period to my life, it would be curiosity to find out what it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nabout, and what it means; there are so many provoking mysteries,\r\nreally, that are hidden from us. Major, you to play!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major played; and Mr Dombey, looking on for his instruction, would\r\nsoon have been in a state of dire confusion, but that he gave no\r\nattention to the game whatever, and sat wondering instead when Edith\r\nwould come back.\r\n\r\nShe came at last, and sat down to her harp, and Mr Dombey rose and\r\nstood beside her, listening. He had little taste for music, and no\r\nknowledge of the strain she played, but he saw her bending over it, and\r\nperhaps he heard among the sounding strings some distant music of his\r\nown, that tamed the monster of the iron road, and made it less\r\ninexorable.\r\n\r\nCleopatra had a sharp eye, verily, at picquet. It glistened like a\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s, and did not fix itself upon the game, but pierced the room from\r\nend to end, and gleamed on harp, performer, listener, everything.\r\n\r\nWhen the haughty beauty had concluded, she arose, and receiving Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s thanks and compliments in exactly the same manner as before,\r\nwent with scarcely any pause to the piano, and began there.\r\n\r\nEdith Granger, any song but that! Edith Granger, you are very handsome,\r\nand your touch upon the keys is brilliant, and your voice is deep and\r\nrich; but not the air that his neglected daughter sang to his dead son!\r\n\r\nAlas, he knows it not; and if he did, what air of hers would stir him,\r\nrigid man! Sleep, lonely Florence, sleep! Peace in thy dreams, although\r\nthe night has turned dark, and the clouds are gathering, and threaten\r\nto discharge themselves in hail!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nA Trifle of Management by Mr Carker the Manager\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager sat at his desk, smooth and soft as usual,\r\nreading those letters which were reserved for him to open, backing them\r\noccasionally with such memoranda and references as their business\r\npurport required, and parcelling them out into little heaps for\r\ndistribution through the several departments of the House. The post had\r\ncome in heavy that morning, and Mr Carker the Manager had a good deal\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nThe general action of a man so engaged\xe2\x80\x94pausing to look over a bundle of\r\npapers in his hand, dealing them round in various portions, taking up\r\nanother bundle and examining its contents with knitted brows and\r\npursed-out lips\xe2\x80\x94dealing, and sorting, and pondering by turns\xe2\x80\x94would\r\neasily suggest some whimsical resemblance to a player at cards. The\r\nface of Mr Carker the Manager was in good keeping with such a fancy. It\r\nwas the face of a man who studied his play, warily: who made himself\r\nmaster of all the strong and weak points of the game: who registered\r\nthe cards in his mind as they fell about him, knew exactly what was on\r\nthem, what they missed, and what they made: who was crafty to find out\r\nwhat the other players held, and who never betrayed his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe letters were in various languages, but Mr Carker the Manager read\r\nthem all. If there had been anything in the offices of Dombey and Son\r\nthat he could read, there would have been a card wanting in the pack.\r\nHe read almost at a glance, and made combinations of one letter with\r\nanother and one business with another as he went on, adding new matter\r\nto the heaps\xe2\x80\x94much as a man would know the cards at sight, and work out\r\ntheir combinations in his mind after they were turned. Something too\r\ndeep for a partner, and much too deep for an adversary, Mr Carker the\r\nManager sat in the rays of the sun that came down slanting on him\r\nthrough the skylight, playing his game alone.\r\n\r\nAnd although it is not among the instincts wild or domestic of the cat\r\ntribe to play at cards, feline from sole to crown was Mr Carker the\r\nManager, as he basked in the strip of summer-light and warmth that\r\nshone upon his table and the ground as if they were a crooked\r\ndial-plate, and himself the only figure on it. With hair and whiskers\r\ndeficient in colour at all times, but feebler than common in the rich\r\nsunshine, and more like the coat of a sandy tortoise-shell cat; with\r\nlong nails, nicely pared and sharpened; with a natural antipathy to any\r\nspeck of dirt, which made him pause sometimes and watch the falling\r\nmotes of dust, and rub them off his smooth white hand or glossy linen:\r\nMr Carker the Manager, sly of manner, sharp of tooth, soft of foot,\r\nwatchful of eye, oily of tongue, cruel of heart, nice of habit, sat\r\nwith a dainty steadfastness and patience at his work, as if he were\r\nwaiting at a mouse\xe2\x80\x99s hole.\r\n\r\nAt length the letters were disposed of, excepting one which he reserved\r\nfor a particular audience. Having locked the more confidential\r\ncorrespondence in a drawer, Mr Carker the Manager rang his bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you answer it?\xe2\x80\x9d was his reception of his brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe messenger is out, and I am the next,\xe2\x80\x9d was the submissive reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the next?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! Creditable to me!\r\nThere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPointing to the heaps of opened letters, he turned disdainfully away,\r\nin his elbow-chair, and broke the seal of that one which he held in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to trouble you, James,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brother, gathering them\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you have something to say. I knew that. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager did not raise his eyes or turn them on his\r\nbrother, but kept them on his letter, though without opening it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am uneasy about Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet who? what Harriet? I know nobody of that name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not well, and has changed very much of late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe changed very much, a great many years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Manager;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that is all I have to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if you would hear me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I hear you, Brother John?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Manager, laying a\r\nsarcastic emphasis on those two words, and throwing up his head, but\r\nnot lifting his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Harriet Carker made her choice many\r\nyears ago between her two brothers. She may repent it, but she must\r\nabide by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mistake me. I do not say she does repent it. It would be black\r\ningratitude in me to hint at such a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThough\r\nbelieve me, James, I am as sorry for her sacrifice as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs sorry for her choice\xe2\x80\x94for what you call her choice\xe2\x80\x94as you are angry\r\nat it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Junior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the other, with a wide show of his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDispleased. Whatever word you like best. You know my meaning. There is\r\nno offence in my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is offence in everything you do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his brother, glancing\r\nat him with a sudden scowl, which in a moment gave place to a wider\r\nsmile than the last. \xe2\x80\x9cCarry those papers away, if you please. I am\r\nbusy.\r\n\r\nHis politeness was so much more cutting than his wrath, that the Junior\r\nwent to the door. But stopping at it, and looking round, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Harriet tried in vain to plead for me with you, on your first\r\njust indignation, and my first disgrace; and when she left you, James,\r\nto follow my broken fortunes, and devote herself, in her mistaken\r\naffection, to a ruined brother, because without her he had no one, and\r\nwas lost; she was young and pretty. I think if you could see her now\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou would go and see her\xe2\x80\x94she would move your admiration and\r\ncompassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Manager inclined his head, and showed his teeth, as who should say,\r\nin answer to some careless small-talk, \xe2\x80\x9cDear me! Is that the case?\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nsaid never a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought in those days: you and I both: that she would marry young,\r\nand lead a happy and light-hearted life,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if you\r\nknew how cheerfully she cast those hopes away; how cheerfully she has\r\ngone forward on the path she took, and never once looked back; you\r\nnever could say again that her name was strange in your ears. Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Manager inclined his head and showed his teeth, and seemed to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cRemarkable indeed! You quite surprise me!\xe2\x80\x9d And again he uttered\r\nnever a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go on?\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker, mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your way?\xe2\x80\x9d replied his smiling brother. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will have the\r\ngoodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Carker, with a sigh, was passing slowly out at the door, when his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s voice detained him for a moment on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she has gone, and goes, her own way cheerfully,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing\r\nthe still unfolded letter on his desk, and putting his hands firmly in\r\nhis pockets, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may tell her that I go as cheerfully on mine. If she\r\nhas never once looked back, you may tell her that I have, sometimes, to\r\nrecall her taking part with you, and that my resolution is no easier to\r\nwear away;\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled very sweetly here; \xe2\x80\x9cthan marble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell her nothing of you. We never speak about you. Once a year, on\r\nyour birthday, Harriet says always, \xe2\x80\x98Let us remember James by name, and\r\nwish him happy,\xe2\x80\x99 but we say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it then, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, \xe2\x80\x9cto yourself. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it too often, as a lesson to you to avoid the subject in\r\nspeaking to me. I know no Harriet Carker. There is no such person. You\r\nmay have a sister; make much of her. I have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager took up the letter again, and waved it with a\r\nsmile of mock courtesy towards the door. Unfolding it as his brother\r\nwithdrew, and looking darkly after him as he left the room, he once\r\nmore turned round in his elbow-chair, and applied himself to a diligent\r\nperusal of its contents.\r\n\r\nIt was in the writing of his great chief, Mr Dombey, and dated from\r\nLeamington. Though he was a quick reader of all other letters, Mr\r\nCarker read this slowly; weighing the words as he went, and bringing\r\nevery tooth in his head to bear upon them. When he had read it through\r\nonce, he turned it over again, and picked out these passages. \xe2\x80\x9cI find\r\nmyself benefited by the change, and am not yet inclined to name any\r\ntime for my return.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI wish, Carker, you would arrange to come down\r\nonce and see me here, and let me know how things are going on, in\r\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI omitted to speak to you about young Gay. If not gone per\r\nSon and Heir, or if Son and Heir still lying in the Docks, appoint some\r\nother young man and keep him in the City for the present. I am not\r\ndecided.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker the Manager,\r\nexpanding his mouth, as if it were made of India-rubber: \xe2\x80\x9cfor he\xe2\x80\x99s far\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill that passage, which was in a postscript, attracted his attention\r\nand his teeth, once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy good friend Captain Cuttle mentioned something\r\nabout being towed along in the wake of that day. What a pity he\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nfar away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe refolded the letter, and was sitting trifling with it, standing it\r\nlong-wise and broad-wise on his table, and turning it over and over on\r\nall sides\xe2\x80\x94doing pretty much the same thing, perhaps, by its\r\ncontents\xe2\x80\x94when Mr Perch the messenger knocked softly at the door, and\r\ncoming in on tiptoe, bending his body at every step as if it were the\r\ndelight of his life to bow, laid some papers on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you please to be engaged, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Perch, rubbing his\r\nhands, and deferentially putting his head on one side, like a man who\r\nfelt he had no business to hold it up in such a presence, and would\r\nkeep it as much out of the way as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, in a soft voice, \xe2\x80\x9creally nobody, Sir, to\r\nspeak of at present. Mr Gills the Ship\xe2\x80\x99s Instrument-maker, Sir, has\r\nlooked in, about a little matter of payment, he says: but I mentioned\r\nto him, Sir, that you was engaged several deep; several deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch coughed once behind his hand, and waited for further orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t of my own self take the liberty\r\nof mentioning, Sir, that there was anybody else; but that same young\r\nlad that was here yesterday, Sir, and last week, has been hanging about\r\nthe place; and it looks, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Perch, stopping to shut the\r\ndoor, \xe2\x80\x9cdreadful unbusiness-like to see him whistling to the sparrows\r\ndown the court, and making of \xe2\x80\x99em answer him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said he wanted something to do, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Perch?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr\r\nCarker, leaning back in his chair and looking at that officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, coughing behind his hand again, \xe2\x80\x9chis\r\nexpression certainly were that he was in wants of a sitiwation, and\r\nthat he considered something might be done for him about the Docks,\r\nbeing used to fishing with a rod and line: but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Perch shook his\r\nhead very dubiously indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say when he comes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, coughing another cough behind his hand,\r\nwhich was always his resource as an expression of humility when nothing\r\nelse occurred to him, \xe2\x80\x9chis observation generally air that he would\r\nhumbly wish to see one of the gentlemen, and that he wants to earn a\r\nliving. But you see, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added Perch, dropping his voice to a\r\nwhisper, and turning, in the inviolable nature of his confidence, to\r\ngive the door a thrust with his hand and knee, as if that would shut it\r\nany more when it was shut already, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s hardly to be bore, Sir, that a\r\ncommon lad like that should come a prowling here, and saying that his\r\nmother nursed our House\xe2\x80\x99s young gentleman, and that he hopes our House\r\nwill give him a chance on that account. I am sure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr\r\nPerch, \xe2\x80\x9cthat although Mrs Perch was at that time nursing as thriving a\r\nlittle girl, Sir, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever took the liberty of adding to our\r\nfamily, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made so free as drop a hint of her being\r\ncapable of imparting nourishment, not if it was never so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker grinned at him like a shark, but in an absent, thoughtful\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether,\xe2\x80\x9d submitted Mr Perch, after a short silence, and another\r\ncough, \xe2\x80\x9cit mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be best for me to tell him, that if he was seen\r\nhere any more he would be given into custody; and to keep to it! With\r\nrespect to bodily fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so timid, myself, by\r\nnature, Sir, and my nerves is so unstrung by Mrs Perch\xe2\x80\x99s state, that I\r\ncould take my affidavit easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see this fellow, Perch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cBring him in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir. Begging your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, hesitating at the\r\ndoor, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s rough, Sir, in appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. If he\xe2\x80\x99s there, bring him in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Mr Gills directly.\r\nAsk him to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch bowed; and shutting the door, as precisely and carefully as if\r\nhe were not coming back for a week, went on his quest among the\r\nsparrows in the court. While he was gone, Mr Carker assumed his\r\nfavourite attitude before the fire-place, and stood looking at the\r\ndoor; presenting, with his under lip tucked into the smile that showed\r\nhis whole row of upper teeth, a singularly crouching apace.\r\n\r\nThe messenger was not long in returning, followed by a pair of heavy\r\nboots that came bumping along the passage like boxes. With the\r\nunceremonious words \xe2\x80\x9cCome along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a very unusual form of\r\nintroduction from his lips\xe2\x80\x94Mr Perch then ushered into the presence a\r\nstrong-built lad of fifteen, with a round red face, a round sleek head,\r\nround black eyes, round limbs, and round body, who, to carry out the\r\ngeneral rotundity of his appearance, had a round hat in his hand,\r\nwithout a particle of brim to it.\r\n\r\nObedient to a nod from Mr Carker, Perch had no sooner confronted the\r\nvisitor with that gentleman than he withdrew. The moment they were face\r\nto face alone, Mr Carker, without a word of preparation, took him by\r\nthe throat, and shook him until his head seemed loose upon his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring\r\nwildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him,\r\nand at the office walls, as though determined, if he were choked, that\r\nhis last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which\r\nhe was paying such a severe penalty, at last contrived to utter\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Sir! You let me alone, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet you alone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! I have got you, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas no doubt of that, and tightly too. \xe2\x80\x9cYou dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker,\r\nthrough his set jaws, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll strangle you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiler whimpered, would he though? oh no he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and what was he\r\ndoing of\xe2\x80\x94and why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he strangle some\xe2\x80\x94body of his own size and not\r\nhim: but Biler was quelled by the extraordinary nature of his\r\nreception, and, as his head became stationary, and he looked the\r\ngentleman in the face, or rather in the teeth, and saw him snarling at\r\nhim, he so far forgot his manhood as to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t done nothing to you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biler, otherwise Rob,\r\notherwise Grinder, and always Toodle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Carker, slowly releasing him, and\r\nmoving back a step into his favourite position. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\ndaring to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered Rob, putting one hand to his\r\nthroat, and the knuckles of the other to his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never come\r\nagain, Sir. I only wanted work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork, young Cain that you are!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Carker, eyeing him\r\nnarrowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you the idlest vagabond in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impeachment, while it much affected Mr Toodle Junior, attached to\r\nhis character so justly, that he could not say a word in denial. He\r\nstood looking at the gentleman, therefore, with a frightened,\r\nself-convicted, and remorseful air. As to his looking at him, it may be\r\nobserved that he was fascinated by Mr Carker, and never took his round\r\neyes off him for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you a thief?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with his hands behind him in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t indeed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cI never did such a thing as\r\nthieve, Sir, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a going wrong, Sir,\r\never since I took to bird-catching and walking-matching. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a\r\ncove might think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle Junior, with a burst of penitence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat singing birds was innocent company, but nobody knows what harm is\r\nin them little creeturs and what they brings you down to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey seemed to have brought him down to a velveteen jacket and trousers\r\nvery much the worse for wear, a particularly small red waistcoat like a\r\ngorget, an interval of blue check, and the hat before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t been home twenty times since them birds got their will of me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s ten months. How can I go home when everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmiserable to see me! I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biler, blubbering outright, and\r\nsmearing his eyes with his coat-cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been and drownded\r\nmyself over and over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of which, including his expression of surprise at not having\r\nachieved this last scarce performance, the boy said, just as if the\r\nteeth of Mr Carker drew it out of him, and he had no power of\r\nconcealing anything with that battery of attraction in full play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a nice young gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, shaking his head at\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s hemp-seed sown for you, my fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the wretched Biler, blubbering again, and\r\nagain having recourse to his coat-cuff: \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care, sometimes,\r\nif it was growed too. My misfortunes all began in wagging, Sir; but\r\nwhat could I do, exceptin\xe2\x80\x99 wag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcepting what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWag, Sir. Wagging from school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean pretending to go there, and not going?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s wagging, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the quondam Grinder, much\r\naffected. \xe2\x80\x9cI was chivied through the streets, Sir, when I went there,\r\nand pounded when I got there. So I wagged, and hid myself, and that\r\nbegan it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, taking him by the throat\r\nagain, holding him out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length, and surveying him in silence\r\nfor some moments, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you want a place, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be thankful to be tried, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Toodle Junior,\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager pushed him backward into a corner\xe2\x80\x94the boy\r\nsubmitting quietly, hardly venturing to breathe, and never once\r\nremoving his eyes from his face\xe2\x80\x94and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Mr Gills to come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the\r\nfigure in the corner: and Uncle Sol appeared immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9csit down. How do you do? You\r\ncontinue to enjoy your health, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Uncle Sol, taking out his pocket-book, and\r\nhanding over some notes as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing ails me in body but old\r\nage. Twenty-five, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as punctual and exact, Mr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the smiling Manager,\r\ntaking a paper from one of his many drawers, and making an endorsement\r\non it, while Uncle Sol looked over him, \xe2\x80\x9cas one of your own\r\nchronometers. Quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Son and Heir has not been spoken, I find by the list, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nUncle Sol, with a slight addition to the usual tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Son and Heir has not been spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cThere seems\r\nto have been tempestuous weather, Mr Gills, and she has probably been\r\ndriven out of her course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is safe, I trust in Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is safe, I trust in Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr Carker in that voiceless\r\nmanner of his: which made the observant young Toodle tremble again. \xe2\x80\x9cMr\r\nGills,\xe2\x80\x9d he added aloud, throwing himself back in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nmiss your nephew very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Sol, standing by him, shook his head and heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, with his soft hand playing round his mouth,\r\nand looking up into the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be company\r\nto you to have a young fellow in your shop just now, and it would be\r\nobliging me if you would give one house-room for the present. No, to be\r\nsure,\xe2\x80\x9d he added quickly, in anticipation of what the old man was going\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s not much business doing there, I know; but you can\r\nmake him clean the place out, polish up the instruments; drudge, Mr\r\nGills. That\xe2\x80\x99s the lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSol Gills pulled down his spectacles from his forehead to his eyes, and\r\nlooked at Toodle Junior standing upright in the corner: his head\r\npresenting the appearance (which it always did) of having been newly\r\ndrawn out of a bucket of cold water; his small waistcoat rising and\r\nfalling quickly in the play of his emotions; and his eyes intently\r\nfixed on Mr Carker, without the least reference to his proposed master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give him house-room, Mr Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager.\r\n\r\nOld Sol, without being quite enthusiastic on the subject, replied that\r\nhe was glad of any opportunity, however slight, to oblige Mr Carker,\r\nwhose wish on such a point was a command: and that the wooden\r\nMidshipman would consider himself happy to receive in his berth any\r\nvisitor of Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s selecting.\r\n\r\nMr Carker bared himself to the tops and bottoms of his gums: making the\r\nwatchful Toodle Junior tremble more and more: and acknowledged the\r\nInstrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s politeness in his most affable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll dispose of him so, then, Mr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, rising, and\r\nshaking the old man by the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I make up my mind what to do\r\nwith him, and what he deserves. As I consider myself responsible for\r\nhim, Mr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d here he smiled a wide smile at Rob, who shook before\r\nit: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad if you\xe2\x80\x99ll look sharply after him, and report his\r\nbehaviour to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask a question or two of his parents as I ride\r\nhome this afternoon\xe2\x80\x94respectable people\xe2\x80\x94to confirm some particulars in\r\nhis own account of himself; and that done, Mr Gills, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him\r\nround to you to-morrow morning. Goodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis smile at parting was so full of teeth, that it confused old Sol,\r\nand made him vaguely uncomfortable. He went home, thinking of raging\r\nseas, foundering ships, drowning men, an ancient bottle of Madeira\r\nnever brought to light, and other dismal matters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, putting his hand on young Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and bringing him out into the middle of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nheard me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued his patron, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you ever deceive\r\nor play tricks with me, you had better have drowned yourself, indeed,\r\nonce for all, before you came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in any branch of mental acquisition that Rob seemed\r\nto understand better than that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have lied to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cin anything, never come in\r\nmy way again. If not, you may let me find you waiting for me somewhere\r\nnear your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house this afternoon. I shall leave this at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and ride there on horseback. Now, give me the address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob repeated it slowly, as Mr Carker wrote it down. Rob even spelt it\r\nover a second time, letter by letter, as if he thought that the\r\nomission of a dot or scratch would lead to his destruction. Mr Carker\r\nthen handed him out of the room; and Rob, keeping his round eyes fixed\r\nupon his patron to the last, vanished for the time being.\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager did a great deal of business in the course of the\r\nday, and bestowed his teeth upon a great many people. In the office, in\r\nthe court, in the street, and on \xe2\x80\x9cChange, they glistened and bristled\r\nto a terrible extent. Five o\xe2\x80\x99clock arriving, and with it Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbay horse, they got on horseback, and went gleaming up Cheapside.\r\n\r\nAs no one can easily ride fast, even if inclined to do so, through the\r\npress and throng of the City at that hour, and as Mr Carker was not\r\ninclined, he went leisurely along, picking his way among the carts and\r\ncarriages, avoiding whenever he could the wetter and more dirty places\r\nin the over-watered road, and taking infinite pains to keep himself and\r\nhis steed clean. Glancing at the passersby while he was thus ambling on\r\nhis way, he suddenly encountered the round eyes of the sleek-headed Rob\r\nintently fixed upon his face as if they had never been taken off, while\r\nthe boy himself, with a pocket-handkerchief twisted up like a speckled\r\neel and girded round his waist, made a very conspicuous demonstration\r\nof being prepared to attend upon him, at whatever pace he might think\r\nproper to go.\r\n\r\nThis attention, however flattering, being one of an unusual kind, and\r\nattracting some notice from the other passengers, Mr Carker took\r\nadvantage of a clearer thoroughfare and a cleaner road, and broke into\r\na trot. Rob immediately did the same. Mr Carker presently tried a\r\ncanter; Rob was still in attendance. Then a short gallop; it was all\r\none to the boy. Whenever Mr Carker turned his eyes to that side of the\r\nroad, he still saw Toodle Junior holding his course, apparently without\r\ndistress, and working himself along by the elbows after the most\r\napproved manner of professional gentlemen who get over the ground for\r\nwagers.\r\n\r\nRidiculous as this attendance was, it was a sign of an influence\r\nestablished over the boy, and therefore Mr Carker, affecting not to\r\nnotice it, rode away into the neighbourhood of Mr Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s house. On\r\nhis slackening his pace here, Rob appeared before him to point out the\r\nturnings; and when he called to a man at a neighbouring gateway to hold\r\nhis horse, pending his visit to the buildings that had succeeded\r\nStaggs\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens, Rob dutifully held the stirrup, while the Manager\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, taking him by the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9ccome along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prodigal son was evidently nervous of visiting the parental abode;\r\nbut Mr Carker pushing him on before, he had nothing for it but to open\r\nthe right door, and suffer himself to be walked into the midst of his\r\nbrothers and sisters, mustered in overwhelming force round the family\r\ntea-table. At sight of the prodigal in the grasp of a stranger, these\r\ntender relations united in a general howl, which smote upon the\r\nprodigal\xe2\x80\x99s breast so sharply when he saw his mother stand up among\r\nthem, pale and trembling, with the baby in her arms, that he lent his\r\nown voice to the chorus.\r\n\r\nNothing doubting now that the stranger, if not Mr Ketch in person, was\r\none of that company, the whole of the young family wailed the louder,\r\nwhile its more infantine members, unable to control the transports of\r\nemotion appertaining to their time of life, threw themselves on their\r\nbacks like young birds when terrified by a hawk, and kicked violently.\r\nAt length, poor Polly making herself audible, said, with quivering\r\nlips, \xe2\x80\x9cOh Rob, my poor boy, what have you done at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, in a piteous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cask the gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to do him good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this announcement, Polly, who had not cried yet, began to do so. The\r\nelder Toodles, who appeared to have been meditating a rescue,\r\nunclenched their fists. The younger Toodles clustered round their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and peeped from under their own chubby arms at their\r\ndesperado brother and his unknown friend. Everybody blessed the\r\ngentleman with the beautiful teeth, who wanted to do good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker to Polly, giving him a gentle shake, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nyour son, eh, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Polly, with a curtsey; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad son, I am afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever a bad son to me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been a little wild, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Polly, checking the baby,\r\nwho was making convulsive efforts with his arms and legs to launch\r\nhimself on Biler, through the ambient air, \xe2\x80\x9cand has gone with wrong\r\ncompanions: but I hope he has seen the misery of that, Sir, and will do\r\nwell again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker looked at Polly, and the clean room, and the clean children,\r\nand the simple Toodle face, combined of father and mother, that was\r\nreflected and repeated everywhere about him\xe2\x80\x94and seemed to have achieved\r\nthe real purpose of his visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband, I take it, is not at home?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s down the line at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prodigal Rob seemed very much relieved to hear it: though still in\r\nthe absorption of all his faculties in his patron, he hardly took his\r\neyes from Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s face, unless for a moment at a time to steal a\r\nsorrowful glance at his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how I have stumbled on this boy\r\nof yours, and who I am, and what I am going to do for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Mr Carker did, in his own way; saying that he at first intended to\r\nhave accumulated nameless terrors on his presumptuous head, for coming\r\nto the whereabout of Dombey and Son. That he had relented, in\r\nconsideration of his youth, his professed contrition, and his friends.\r\nThat he was afraid he took a rash step in doing anything for the boy,\r\nand one that might expose him to the censure of the prudent; but that\r\nhe did it of himself and for himself, and risked the consequences\r\nsingle-handed; and that his mother\xe2\x80\x99s past connexion with Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily had nothing to do with it, and that Mr Dombey had nothing to do\r\nwith it, but that he, Mr Carker, was the be-all and the end-all of this\r\nbusiness. Taking great credit to himself for his goodness, and\r\nreceiving no less from all the family then present, Mr Carker\r\nsignified, indirectly but still pretty plainly, that Rob\xe2\x80\x99s implicit\r\nfidelity, attachment, and devotion, were for evermore his due, and the\r\nleast homage he could receive. And with this great truth Rob himself\r\nwas so impressed, that, standing gazing on his patron with tears\r\nrolling down his cheeks, he nodded his shiny head until it seemed\r\nalmost as loose as it had done under the same patron\xe2\x80\x99s hands that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nPolly, who had passed Heaven knows how many sleepless nights on account\r\nof this her dissipated firstborn, and had not seen him for weeks and\r\nweeks, could have almost kneeled to Mr Carker the Manager, as to a Good\r\nSpirit\xe2\x80\x94in spite of his teeth. But Mr Carker rising to depart, she only\r\nthanked him with her mother\xe2\x80\x99s prayers and blessings; thanks so rich\r\nwhen paid out of the Heart\xe2\x80\x99s mint, especially for any service Mr Carker\r\nhad rendered, that he might have given back a large amount of change,\r\nand yet been overpaid.\r\n\r\nAs that gentleman made his way among the crowding children to the door,\r\nRob retreated on his mother, and took her and the baby in the same\r\nrepentant hug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try hard, dear mother, now. Upon my soul I will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh do, my dear boy! I am sure you will, for our sakes and your own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Polly, kissing him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re coming back to speak to me, when\r\nyou have seen the gentleman away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Rob hesitated, and looked down. \xe2\x80\x9cFather\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe coming home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, mother dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob. And passing through the\r\nshrill cry of his brothers and sisters in reception of this promise, he\r\nfollowed Mr Carker out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, who had heard this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a bad father,\r\nhave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, amazed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a better nor a kinder\r\nfather going, than mine is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to see him then?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired his patron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s such a difference between a father and a mother, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob, after faltering for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly believe yet that\r\nI was doing to do better\xe2\x80\x94though I know he\xe2\x80\x99d try to\xe2\x80\x94but a mother\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nalways believes what\xe2\x80\x99s good, Sir; at least, I know my mother does, God\r\nbless her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s mouth expanded, but he said no more until he was mounted on\r\nhis horse, and had dismissed the man who held it, when, looking down\r\nfrom the saddle steadily into the attentive and watchful face of the\r\nboy, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to me tomorrow morning, and you shall be shown where that\r\nold gentleman lives; that old gentleman who was with me this morning;\r\nwhere you are going, as you heard me say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a great interest in that old gentleman, and in serving him, you\r\nserve me, boy, do you understand? Well,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, interrupting him,\r\nfor he saw his round face brighten when he was told that: \xe2\x80\x9cI see you\r\ndo. I want to know all about that old gentleman, and how he goes on\r\nfrom day to day\xe2\x80\x94for I am anxious to be of service to him\xe2\x80\x94and especially\r\nwho comes there to see him. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob nodded his steadfast face, and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know that he has friends who are attentive to him,\r\nand that they don\xe2\x80\x99t desert him\xe2\x80\x94for he lives very much alone now, poor\r\nfellow; but that they are fond of him, and of his nephew who has gone\r\nabroad. There is a very young lady who may perhaps come to see him. I\r\nwant particularly to know all about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd take care,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his patron, bending forward to advance his\r\ngrinning face closer to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s, and pat him on the shoulder with the\r\nhandle of his whip: \xe2\x80\x9ctake care you talk about affairs of mine to nobody\r\nbut me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo nobody in the world, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, pointing to the place they had just\r\nleft, \xe2\x80\x9cnor anywhere else. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try how true and grateful you can be.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll prove you!\xe2\x80\x9d Making this, by his display of teeth and by the action\r\nof his head, as much a threat as a promise, he turned from Rob\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nwhich were nailed upon him as if he had won the boy by a charm, body\r\nand soul, and rode away. But again becoming conscious, after trotting a\r\nshort distance, that his devoted henchman, girt as before, was yielding\r\nhim the same attendance, to the great amusement of sundry spectators,\r\nhe reined up, and ordered him off. To ensure his obedience, he turned\r\nin the saddle and watched him as he retired. It was curious to see that\r\neven then Rob could not keep his eyes wholly averted from his patron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, but, constantly turning and turning again to look after him,\r\ninvolved himself in a tempest of buffetings and jostlings from the\r\nother passengers in the street: of which, in the pursuit of the one\r\nparamount idea, he was perfectly heedless.\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager rode on at a foot-pace, with the easy air of one\r\nwho had performed all the business of the day in a satisfactory manner,\r\nand got it comfortably off his mind. Complacent and affable as man\r\ncould be, Mr Carker picked his way along the streets and hummed a soft\r\ntune as he went. He seemed to purr, he was so glad.\r\n\r\nAnd in some sort, Mr Carker, in his fancy, basked upon a hearth too.\r\nCoiled up snugly at certain feet, he was ready for a spring, Or for a\r\ntear, or for a scratch, or for a velvet touch, as the humour took him\r\nand occasion served. Was there any bird in a cage, that came in for a\r\nshare of his regards?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr Carker the Manager, through his song.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! when I saw her last, she was a little child. With dark eyes and\r\nhair, I recollect, and a good face; a very good face! I daresay she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore affable and pleasant yet, and humming his song until his many\r\nteeth vibrated to it, Mr Carker picked his way along, and turned at\r\nlast into the shady street where Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house stood. He had been\r\nso busy, winding webs round good faces, and obscuring them with meshes,\r\nthat he hardly thought of being at this point of his ride, until,\r\nglancing down the cold perspective of tall houses, he reined in his\r\nhorse quickly within a few yards of the door. But to explain why Mr\r\nCarker reined in his horse quickly, and what he looked at in no small\r\nsurprise, a few digressive words are necessary.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, emancipated from the Blimber thraldom and coming into the\r\npossession of a certain portion of his worldly wealth, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\nhad been wont, during his last half-year\xe2\x80\x99s probation, to communicate to\r\nMr Feeder every evening as a new discovery, \xe2\x80\x9cthe executors couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep him out of\xe2\x80\x9d had applied himself with great diligence, to the\r\nscience of Life. Fired with a noble emulation to pursue a brilliant and\r\ndistinguished career, Mr Toots had furnished a choice set of\r\napartments; had established among them a sporting bower, embellished\r\nwith the portraits of winning horses, in which he took no particle of\r\ninterest; and a divan, which made him poorly. In this delicious abode,\r\nMr Toots devoted himself to the cultivation of those gentle arts which\r\nrefine and humanise existence, his chief instructor in which was an\r\ninteresting character called the Game Chicken, who was always to be\r\nheard of at the bar of the Black Badger, wore a shaggy white great-coat\r\nin the warmest weather, and knocked Mr Toots about the head three times\r\na week, for the small consideration of ten and six per visit.\r\n\r\nThe Game Chicken, who was quite the Apollo of Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s Pantheon, had\r\nintroduced to him a marker who taught billiards, a Life Guard who\r\ntaught fencing, a jobmaster who taught riding, a Cornish gentleman who\r\nwas up to anything in the athletic line, and two or three other friends\r\nconnected no less intimately with the fine arts. Under whose auspices\r\nMr Toots could hardly fail to improve apace, and under whose tuition he\r\nwent to work.\r\n\r\nBut however it came about, it came to pass, even while these gentlemen\r\nhad the gloss of novelty upon them, that Mr Toots felt, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow, unsettled and uneasy. There were husks in his corn, that even Game\r\nChickens couldn\xe2\x80\x99t peck up; gloomy giants in his leisure, that even Game\r\nChickens couldn\xe2\x80\x99t knock down. Nothing seemed to do Mr Toots so much\r\ngood as incessantly leaving cards at Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s door. No taxgatherer\r\nin the British Dominions\xe2\x80\x94that wide-spread territory on which the sun\r\nnever sets, and where the tax-gatherer never goes to bed\xe2\x80\x94was more\r\nregular and persevering in his calls than Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nMr Toots never went upstairs; and always performed the same ceremonies,\r\nrichly dressed for the purpose, at the hall door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Good morning!\xe2\x80\x9d would be Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s first remark to the servant.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d would be Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s next remark, as he handed in a\r\ncard. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d would be his next, as he handed in another.\r\n\r\nMr Toots would then turn round as if to go away; but the man knew him\r\nby this time, and knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would say, as if a thought had\r\nsuddenly descended on him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the young woman at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man would rather think she was, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know. Then he\r\nwould ring a bell that rang upstairs, and would look up the staircase,\r\nand would say, yes, she was at home, and was coming down. Then Miss\r\nNipper would appear, and the man would retire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! How de do?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would say, with a chuckle and a blush.\r\n\r\nSusan would thank him, and say she was very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s Diogenes going on?\xe2\x80\x9d would be Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s second interrogation.\r\n\r\nVery well indeed. Miss Florence was fonder and fonder of him every day.\r\nMr Toots was sure to hail this with a burst of chuckles, like the\r\nopening of a bottle of some effervescent beverage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence is quite well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan would add.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d was the invariable reply of Mr\r\nToots; and when he had said so, he always went away very fast.\r\n\r\nNow it is certain that Mr Toots had a filmy something in his mind,\r\nwhich led him to conclude that if he could aspire successfully in the\r\nfulness of time, to the hand of Florence, he would be fortunate and\r\nblest. It is certain that Mr Toots, by some remote and roundabout road,\r\nhad got to that point, and that there he made a stand. His heart was\r\nwounded; he was touched; he was in love. He had made a desperate\r\nattempt, one night, and had sat up all night for the purpose, to write\r\nan acrostic on Florence, which affected him to tears in the conception.\r\nBut he never proceeded in the execution further than the words \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nwhen I gaze,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the flow of imagination in which he had previously\r\nwritten down the initial letters of the other seven lines, deserting\r\nhim at that point.\r\n\r\nBeyond devising that very artful and politic measure of leaving a card\r\nfor Mr Dombey daily, the brain of Mr Toots had not worked much in\r\nreference to the subject that held his feelings prisoner. But deep\r\nconsideration at length assured Mr Toots that an important step to\r\ngain, was, the conciliation of Miss Susan Nipper, preparatory to giving\r\nher some inkling of his state of mind.\r\n\r\nA little light and playful gallantry towards this lady seemed the means\r\nto employ in that early chapter of the history, for winning her to his\r\ninterests. Not being able quite to make up his mind about it, he\r\nconsulted the Chicken\xe2\x80\x94without taking that gentleman into his\r\nconfidence; merely informing him that a friend in Yorkshire had written\r\nto him (Mr Toots) for his opinion on such a question. The Chicken\r\nreplying that his opinion always was, \xe2\x80\x9cGo in and win,\xe2\x80\x9d and further,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your man\xe2\x80\x99s before you and your work cut out, go in and do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nToots considered this a figurative way of supporting his own view of\r\nthe case, and heroically resolved to kiss Miss Nipper next day.\r\n\r\nUpon the next day, therefore, Mr Toots, putting into requisition some\r\nof the greatest marvels that Burgess and Co. had ever turned out, went\r\noff to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s upon this design. But his heart failed him so much\r\nas he approached the scene of action, that, although he arrived on the\r\nground at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, it was six before he knocked\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nEverything happened as usual, down to the point where Susan said her\r\nyoung mistress was well, and Mr Toots said it was of no consequence. To\r\nher amazement, Mr Toots, instead of going off, like a rocket, after\r\nthat observation, lingered and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to walk upstairs, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I will come in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nBut instead of walking upstairs, the bold Toots made an awkward plunge\r\nat Susan when the door was shut, and embracing that fair creature,\r\nkissed her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cor Ill tear your eyes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust another!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan, giving him a push \xe2\x80\x9cInnocents like\r\nyou, too! Who\xe2\x80\x99ll begin next? Go along, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan was not in any serious strait, for she could hardly speak for\r\nlaughing; but Diogenes, on the staircase, hearing a rustling against\r\nthe wall, and a shuffling of feet, and seeing through the banisters\r\nthat there was some contention going on, and foreign invasion in the\r\nhouse, formed a different opinion, dashed down to the rescue, and in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye had Mr Toots by the leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSusan screamed, laughed, opened the street-door, and ran downstairs;\r\nthe bold Toots tumbled staggering out into the street, with Diogenes\r\nholding on to one leg of his pantaloons, as if Burgess and Co. were his\r\ncooks, and had provided that dainty morsel for his holiday\r\nentertainment; Diogenes shaken off, rolled over and over in the dust,\r\ngot up again, whirled round the giddy Toots and snapped at him: and all\r\nthis turmoil Mr Carker, reigning up his horse and sitting a little at a\r\ndistance, saw to his amazement, issue from the stately house of Mr\r\nDombey.\r\n\r\nMr Carker remained watching the discomfited Toots, when Diogenes was\r\ncalled in, and the door shut: and while that gentleman, taking refuge\r\nin a doorway near at hand, bound up the torn leg of his pantaloons with\r\na costly silk handkerchief that had formed part of his expensive outfit\r\nfor the advent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, riding up, with his most\r\npropitiatory smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are not hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, raising his flushed face, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof no consequence\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would have signified, if he could, that he\r\nliked it very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the dog\xe2\x80\x99s teeth have entered the leg, Sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Carker, with a\r\ndisplay of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all quite right. It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ncomfortable, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you though?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the blushing Took\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will allow me, perhaps, to apologise, in his absence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nCarker, taking off his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cfor such a misadventure, and to wonder how\r\nit can possibly have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots is so much gratified by this politeness, and the lucky chance\r\nof making friends with a friend of Mr Dombey, that he pulls out his\r\ncard-case which he never loses an opportunity of using, and hands his\r\nname and address to Mr Carker: who responds to that courtesy by giving\r\nhim his own, and with that they part.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Carker picks his way so softly past the house, looking up at the\r\nwindows, and trying to make out the pensive face behind the curtain\r\nlooking at the children opposite, the rough head of Diogenes came\r\nclambering up close by it, and the dog, regardless of all soothing,\r\nbarks and growls, and makes at him from that height, as if he would\r\nspring down and tear him limb from limb.\r\n\r\nWell spoken, Di, so near your Mistress! Another, and another with your\r\nhead up, your eyes flashing, and your vexed mouth worrying itself, for\r\nwant of him! Another, as he picks his way along! You have a good scent,\r\nDi,\xe2\x80\x94cats, boy, cats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nFlorence solitary, and the Midshipman mysterious\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence lived alone in the great dreary house, and day succeeded day,\r\nand still she lived alone; and the blank walls looked down upon her\r\nwith a vacant stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like mind to stare her\r\nyouth and beauty into stone.\r\n\r\nNo magic dwelling-place in magic story, shut up in the heart of a thick\r\nwood, was ever more solitary and deserted to the fancy, than was her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mansion in its grim reality, as it stood lowering on the\r\nstreet: always by night, when lights were shining from neighbouring\r\nwindows, a blot upon its scanty brightness; always by day, a frown upon\r\nits never-smiling face.\r\n\r\nThere were not two dragon sentries keeping ward before the gate of this\r\nabove, as in magic legend are usually found on duty over the wronged\r\ninnocence imprisoned; but besides a glowering visage, with its thin\r\nlips parted wickedly, that surveyed all comers from above the archway\r\nof the door, there was a monstrous fantasy of rusty iron, curling and\r\ntwisting like a petrifaction of an arbour over threshold, budding in\r\nspikes and corkscrew points, and bearing, one on either side, two\r\nominous extinguishers, that seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho enter here, leave light\r\nbehind!\xe2\x80\x9d There were no talismanic characters engraven on the portal,\r\nbut the house was now so neglected in appearance, that boys chalked the\r\nrailings and the pavement\xe2\x80\x94particularly round the corner where the side\r\nwall was\xe2\x80\x94and drew ghosts on the stable door; and being sometimes driven\r\noff by Mr Towlinson, made portraits of him, in return, with his ears\r\ngrowing out horizontally from under his hat. Noise ceased to be, within\r\nthe shadow of the roof. The brass band that came into the street once a\r\nweek, in the morning, never brayed a note in at those windows; but all\r\nsuch company, down to a poor little piping organ of weak intellect,\r\nwith an imbecile party of automaton dancers, waltzing in and out at\r\nfolding-doors, fell off from it with one accord, and shunned it as a\r\nhopeless place.\r\n\r\nThe spell upon it was more wasting than the spell that used to set\r\nenchanted houses sleeping once upon a time, but left their waking\r\nfreshness unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about\r\nit. Within doors, curtains, drooping heavily, lost their old folds and\r\nshapes, and hung like cumbrous palls. Hecatombs of furniture, still\r\npiled and covered up, shrunk like imprisoned and forgotten men, and\r\nchanged insensibly. Mirrors were dim as with the breath of years.\r\nPatterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint, like the\r\nmemory of those years\xe2\x80\x99 trifling incidents. Boards, starting at unwonted\r\nfootsteps, creaked and shook. Keys rusted in the locks of doors. Damp\r\nstarted on the walls, and as the stains came out, the pictures seemed\r\nto go in and secrete themselves. Mildew and mould began to lurk in\r\nclosets. Fungus trees grew in corners of the cellars. Dust accumulated,\r\nnobody knew whence nor how; spiders, moths, and grubs were heard of\r\nevery day. An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable\r\nupon the stairs, or in an upper room, as wondering how he got there.\r\nRats began to squeak and scuffle in the night time, through dark\r\ngalleries they mined behind the panelling.\r\n\r\nThe dreary magnificence of the state rooms, seen imperfectly by the\r\ndoubtful light admitted through closed shutters, would have answered\r\nwell enough for an enchanted abode. Such as the tarnished paws of\r\ngilded lions, stealthily put out from beneath their wrappers; the\r\nmarble lineaments of busts on pedestals, fearfully revealing themselves\r\nthrough veils; the clocks that never told the time, or, if wound up by\r\nany chance, told it wrong, and struck unearthly numbers, which are not\r\nupon the dial; the accidental tinklings among the pendant lustres, more\r\nstartling than alarm-bells; the softened sounds and laggard air that\r\nmade their way among these objects, and a phantom crowd of others,\r\nshrouded and hooded, and made spectral of shape. But, besides, there\r\nwas the great staircase, where the lord of the place so rarely set his\r\nfoot, and by which his little child had gone up to Heaven. There were\r\nother staircases and passages where no one went for weeks together;\r\nthere were two closed rooms associated with dead members of the family,\r\nand with whispered recollections of them; and to all the house but\r\nFlorence, there was a gentle figure moving through the solitude and\r\ngloom, that gave to every lifeless thing a touch of present human\r\ninterest and wonder.\r\n\r\nFor Florence lived alone in the deserted house, and day succeeded day,\r\nand still she lived alone, and the cold walls looked down upon her with\r\na vacant stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like mind to stare her youth\r\nand beauty into stone.\r\n\r\nThe grass began to grow upon the roof, and in the crevices of the\r\nbasement paving. A scaly crumbling vegetation sprouted round the\r\nwindow-sills. Fragments of mortar lost their hold upon the insides of\r\nthe unused chimneys, and came dropping down. The two trees with the\r\nsmoky trunks were blighted high up, and the withered branches\r\ndomineered above the leaves, Through the whole building white had\r\nturned yellow, yellow nearly black; and since the time when the poor\r\nlady died, it had slowly become a dark gap in the long monotonous\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nBut Florence bloomed there, like the king\xe2\x80\x99s fair daughter in the story.\r\nHer books, her music, and her daily teachers, were her only real\r\ncompanions, Susan Nipper and Diogenes excepted: of whom the former, in\r\nher attendance on the studies of her young mistress, began to grow\r\nquite learned herself, while the latter, softened possibly by the same\r\ninfluences, would lay his head upon the window-ledge, and placidly open\r\nand shut his eyes upon the street, all through a summer morning;\r\nsometimes pricking up his head to look with great significance after\r\nsome noisy dog in a cart, who was barking his way along, and sometimes,\r\nwith an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed\r\nenemy in the neighbourhood, rushing to the door, whence, after a\r\ndeafening disturbance, he would come jogging back with a ridiculous\r\ncomplacency that belonged to him, and lay his jaw upon the window-ledge\r\nagain, with the air of a dog who had done a public service.\r\n\r\nSo Florence lived in her wilderness of a home, within the circle of her\r\ninnocent pursuits and thoughts, and nothing harmed her. She could go\r\ndown to her father\xe2\x80\x99s rooms now, and think of him, and suffer her loving\r\nheart humbly to approach him, without fear of repulse. She could look\r\nupon the objects that had surrounded him in his sorrow, and could\r\nnestle near his chair, and not dread the glance that she so well\r\nremembered. She could render him such little tokens of her duty and\r\nservice, as putting everything in order for him with her own hands,\r\nbinding little nosegays for table, changing them as one by one they\r\nwithered and he did not come back, preparing something for him every\r\nday, and leaving some timid mark of her presence near his usual seat.\r\nToday, it was a little painted stand for his watch; tomorrow she would\r\nbe afraid to leave it, and would substitute some other trifle of her\r\nmaking not so likely to attract his eye. Waking in the night, perhaps,\r\nshe would tremble at the thought of his coming home and angrily\r\nrejecting it, and would hurry down with slippered feet and quickly\r\nbeating heart, and bring it away. At another time, she would only lay\r\nher face upon his desk, and leave a kiss there, and a tear.\r\n\r\nStill no one knew of this. Unless the household found it out when she\r\nwas not there\xe2\x80\x94and they all held Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s rooms in awe\xe2\x80\x94it was as deep\r\na secret in her breast as what had gone before it. Florence stole into\r\nthose rooms at twilight, early in the morning, and at times when meals\r\nwere served downstairs. And although they were in every nook the better\r\nand the brighter for her care, she entered and passed out as quietly as\r\nany sunbeam, opting that she left her light behind.\r\n\r\nShadowy company attended Florence up and down the echoing house, and\r\nsat with her in the dismantled rooms. As if her life were an enchanted\r\nvision, there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts, that made\r\nit fanciful and unreal. She imagined so often what her life would have\r\nbeen if her father could have loved her and she had been a favourite\r\nchild, that sometimes, for the moment, she almost believed it was so,\r\nand, borne on by the current of that pensive fiction, seemed to\r\nremember how they had watched her brother in his grave together; how\r\nthey had freely shared his heart between them; how they were united in\r\nthe dear remembrance of him; how they often spoke about him yet; and\r\nher kind father, looking at her gently, told her of their common hope\r\nand trust in God. At other times she pictured to herself her mother yet\r\nalive. And oh the happiness of falling on her neck, and clinging to her\r\nwith the love and confidence of all her soul! And oh the desolation of\r\nthe solitary house again, with evening coming on, and no one there!\r\n\r\nBut there was one thought, scarcely shaped out to herself, yet fervent\r\nand strong within her, that upheld Florence when she strove and filled\r\nher true young heart, so sorely tried, with constancy of purpose. Into\r\nher mind, as into all others contending with the great affliction of\r\nour mortal nature, there had stolen solemn wonderings and hopes,\r\narising in the dim world beyond the present life, and murmuring, like\r\nfaint music, of recognition in the far-off land between her brother and\r\nher mother: of some present consciousness in both of her: some love and\r\ncommiseration for her: and some knowledge of her as she went her way\r\nupon the earth. It was a soothing consolation to Florence to give\r\nshelter to these thoughts, until one day\xe2\x80\x94it was soon after she had last\r\nseen her father in his own room, late at night\xe2\x80\x94the fancy came upon her,\r\nthat, in weeping for his alienated heart, she might stir the spirits of\r\nthe dead against him. Wild, weak, childish, as it may have been to\r\nthink so, and to tremble at the half-formed thought, it was the impulse\r\nof her loving nature; and from that hour Florence strove against the\r\ncruel wound in her breast, and tried to think of him whose hand had\r\nmade it, only with hope.\r\n\r\nHer father did not know\xe2\x80\x94she held to it from that time\xe2\x80\x94how much she\r\nloved him. She was very young, and had no mother, and had never\r\nlearned, by some fault or misfortune, how to express to him that she\r\nloved him. She would be patient, and would try to gain that art in\r\ntime, and win him to a better knowledge of his only child.\r\n\r\nThis became the purpose of her life. The morning sun shone down upon\r\nthe faded house, and found the resolution bright and fresh within the\r\nbosom of its solitary mistress, Through all the duties of the day, it\r\nanimated her; for Florence hoped that the more she knew, and the more\r\naccomplished she became, the more glad he would be when he came to know\r\nand like her. Sometimes she wondered, with a swelling heart and rising\r\ntear, whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him\r\nwhen they should become companions. Sometimes she tried to think if\r\nthere were any kind of knowledge that would bespeak his interest more\r\nreadily than another. Always: at her books, her music, and her work: in\r\nher morning walks, and in her nightly prayers: she had her engrossing\r\naim in view. Strange study for a child, to learn the road to a hard\r\nparent\xe2\x80\x99s heart!\r\n\r\nThere were many careless loungers through the street, as the summer\r\nevening deepened into night, who glanced across the road at the sombre\r\nhouse, and saw the youthful figure at the window, such a contrast to\r\nit, looking upward at the stars as they began to shine, who would have\r\nslept the worse if they had known on what design she mused so\r\nsteadfastly. The reputation of the mansion as a haunted house, would\r\nnot have been the gayer with some humble dwellers elsewhere, who were\r\nstruck by its external gloom in passing and repassing on their daily\r\navocations, and so named it, if they could have read its story in the\r\ndarkening face. But Florence held her sacred purpose, unsuspected and\r\nunaided: and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding\r\nthat she loved him, and made no appeal against him in any wandering\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThus Florence lived alone in the deserted house, and day succeeded day,\r\nand still she lived alone, and the monotonous walls looked down upon\r\nher with a stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like intent to stare her\r\nyouth and beauty into stone.\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper stood opposite to her young mistress one morning, as she\r\nfolded and sealed a note she had been writing: and showed in her looks\r\nan approving knowledge of its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter late than never, dear Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I do say,\r\nthat even a visit to them old Skettleses will be a Godsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very good of Sir Barnet and Lady Skettles, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nFlorence, with a mild correction of that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s familiar mention\r\nof the family in question, \xe2\x80\x9cto repeat their invitation so kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper, who was perhaps the most thoroughgoing partisan on the\r\nface of the earth, and who carried her partisanship into all matters\r\ngreat or small, and perpetually waged war with it against society,\r\nscrewed up her lips and shook her head, as a protest against any\r\nrecognition of disinterestedness in the Skettleses, and a plea in bar\r\nthat they would have valuable consideration for their kindness, in the\r\ncompany of Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know what they\xe2\x80\x99re about, if ever people did,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Miss\r\nNipper, drawing in her breath \xe2\x80\x9coh! trust them Skettleses for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very anxious to go to Fulham, Susan, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFlorence thoughtfully: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it will be right to go. I think it will be\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Susan, with another emphatic shake of her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I would prefer to have gone when there\r\nwas no one there, instead of in this vacation time, when it seems there\r\nare some young people staying in the house, I have thankfully said\r\nyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor which _I_ say, Miss Floy, Oh be joyful!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nh\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last ejaculation, with which Miss Nipper frequently wound up a\r\nsentence, at about that epoch of time, was supposed below the level of\r\nthe hall to have a general reference to Mr Dombey, and to be expressive\r\nof a yearning in Miss Nipper to favour that gentleman with a piece of\r\nher mind. But she never explained it; and it had, in consequence, the\r\ncharm of mystery, in addition to the advantage of the sharpest\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long it is before we have any news of Walter, Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nFlorence, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong indeed, Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d replied her maid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Perch said, when he\r\ncame just now to see for letters\xe2\x80\x94but what signifies what he says!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Susan, reddening and breaking off. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch he knows about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence raised her eyes quickly, and a flush overspread her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, evidently struggling with some latent\r\nanxiety and alarm, and looking full at her young mistress, while\r\nendeavouring to work herself into a state of resentment with the\r\nunoffending Mr Perch\xe2\x80\x99s image, \xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t more manliness than that\r\ninsipidest of his sex, I\xe2\x80\x99d never take pride in my hair again, but turn\r\nit up behind my ears, and wear coarse caps, without a bit of border,\r\nuntil death released me from my insignificance. I may not be a Amazon,\r\nMiss Floy, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t so demean myself by such disfigurement, but\r\nanyways I\xe2\x80\x99m not a giver up, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive up! What?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, with a face of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, nothing! It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthat wet curl-paper of a man, Perch, that anyone might almost make away\r\nwith, with a touch, and really it would be a blessed event for all\r\nparties if someone would take pity on him, and would have the\r\ngoodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he give up the ship, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence, very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see him make so bold as\r\ndo it to my face! No, Miss, but he goes on about some bothering ginger\r\nthat Mr Walter was to send to Mrs Perch, and shakes his dismal head,\r\nand says he hopes it may be coming; anyhow, he says, it can\xe2\x80\x99t come now\r\nin time for the intended occasion, but may do for next, which really,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Nipper, with aggravated scorn, \xe2\x80\x9cputs me out of patience with\r\nthe man, for though I can bear a great deal, I am not a camel, neither\r\nam I,\xe2\x80\x9d added Susan, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cif I know myself,\r\na dromedary neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else does he say, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything, Miss Floy, and everything!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSusan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing Miss, he says that there begins to be a general\r\ntalk about the ship, and that they have never had a ship on that voyage\r\nhalf so long unheard of, and that the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s wife was at the office\r\nyesterday, and seemed a little put out about it, but anyone could say\r\nthat, we knew nearly that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must visit Walter\xe2\x80\x99s uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I\r\nleave home. I will go and see him this morning. Let us walk there,\r\ndirectly, Susan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper having nothing to urge against the proposal, but being\r\nperfectly acquiescent, they were soon equipped, and in the streets, and\r\non their way towards the little Midshipman.\r\n\r\nThe state of mind in which poor Walter had gone to Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s, on\r\nthe day when Brogley the broker came into possession, and when there\r\nseemed to him to be an execution in the very steeples, was pretty much\r\nthe same as that in which Florence now took her way to Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nwith this difference, that Florence suffered the added pain of thinking\r\nthat she had been, perhaps, the innocent occasion of involving Walter\r\nin peril, and all to whom he was dear, herself included, in an agony of\r\nsuspense. For the rest, uncertainty and danger seemed written upon\r\neverything. The weathercocks on spires and housetops were mysterious\r\nwith hints of stormy wind, and pointed, like so many ghostly fingers,\r\nout to dangerous seas, where fragments of great wrecks were drifting,\r\nperhaps, and helpless men were rocked upon them into a sleep as deep as\r\nthe unfathomable waters. When Florence came into the City, and passed\r\ngentlemen who were talking together, she dreaded to hear them speaking\r\nof the ship, and saying it was lost. Pictures and prints of vessels\r\nfighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm. The smoke and\r\nclouds, though moving gently, moved too fast for her apprehensions, and\r\nmade her fear there was a tempest blowing at that moment on the ocean.\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper may or may not have been affected similarly, but having\r\nher attention much engaged in struggles with boys, whenever there was\r\nany press of people\xe2\x80\x94for, between that grade of human kind and herself,\r\nthere was some natural animosity that invariably broke out, whenever\r\nthey came together\xe2\x80\x94it would seem that she had not much leisure on the\r\nroad for intellectual operations.\r\n\r\nArriving in good time abreast of the wooden Midshipman on the opposite\r\nside of the way, and waiting for an opportunity to cross the street,\r\nthey were a little surprised at first to see, at the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor, a round-headed lad, with his chubby face addressed towards the\r\nsky, who, as they looked at him, suddenly thrust into his capacious\r\nmouth two fingers of each hand, and with the assistance of that\r\nmachinery whistled, with astonishing shrillness, to some pigeons at a\r\nconsiderable elevation in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Richards\xe2\x80\x99s eldest, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand the worrit of Mrs\r\nRichards\xe2\x80\x99s life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Polly had been to tell Florence of the resuscitated prospects of her\r\nson and heir, Florence was prepared for the meeting: so, a favourable\r\nmoment presenting itself, they both hastened across, without any\r\nfurther contemplation of Mrs Richards\xe2\x80\x99s bane. That sporting character,\r\nunconscious of their approach, again whistled with his utmost might,\r\nand then yelled in a rapture of excitement, \xe2\x80\x9cStrays! Whoo-oop! Strays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich identification had such an effect upon the conscience-stricken\r\npigeons, that instead of going direct to some town in the North of\r\nEngland, as appeared to have been their original intention, they began\r\nto wheel and falter; whereupon Mrs Richards\xe2\x80\x99s first born pierced them\r\nwith another whistle, and again yelled, in a voice that rose above the\r\nturmoil of the street, \xe2\x80\x9cStrays! Whoo-oop! Strays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this transport, he was abruptly recalled to terrestrial objects,\r\nby a poke from Miss Nipper, which sent him into the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the way you show your penitence, when Mrs Richards has been\r\nfretting for you months and months?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, following the poke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob, who smoothed his first rebellious glance at Miss Nipper when he\r\nsaw Florence following, put his knuckles to his hair, in honour of the\r\nlatter, and said to the former, that Mr Gills was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch him home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nipper, with authority, \xe2\x80\x9cand say that my\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your penitence?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, with stinging sharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy how can I go and fetch him when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhimpered the baited Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so unreasonable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr Gills say when he should be home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob, with another application of his knuckles to\r\nhis hair. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he should be home early in the afternoon; in about a\r\ncouple of hours from now, Miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he very anxious about his nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, preferring to address himself to Florence\r\nand slighting Nipper; \xe2\x80\x9cI should say he was, very much so. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nindoors, Miss, not a quarter of an hour together. He can\xe2\x80\x99t settle in\r\none place five minutes. He goes about, like a\xe2\x80\x94just like a stray,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob, stooping to get a glimpse of the pigeons through the window, and\r\nchecking himself, with his fingers half-way to his mouth, on the verge\r\nof another whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know a friend of Mr Gills, called Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nFlorence, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim with a hook, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rob, with an illustrative twist of\r\nhis left hand. Yes, Miss. He was here the day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he not been here since?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, still addressing his reply to Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Walter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle has gone there, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Florence,\r\nturning to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cno, he\xe2\x80\x99s not gone there,\r\nMiss. Because he left particular word that if Captain Cuttle called, I\r\nshould tell him how surprised he was, not to have seen him yesterday,\r\nand should make him stop till he came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Captain Cuttle lives?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\nRob replied in the affirmative, and turning to a greasy parchment book\r\non the shop desk, read the address aloud.\r\n\r\nFlorence again turned to her maid and took counsel with her in a low\r\nvoice, while Rob the round-eyed, mindful of his patron\xe2\x80\x99s secret charge,\r\nlooked on and listened. Florence proposed that they could go to Captain\r\nCuttle\xe2\x80\x99s house; hear from his own lips, what he thought of the absence\r\nof any tidings of the Son and Heir; and bring him, if they could, to\r\ncomfort Uncle Sol. Susan at first objected slightly, on the score of\r\ndistance; but a hackney-coach being mentioned by her mistress, withdrew\r\nthat opposition, and gave in her assent. There were some minutes of\r\ndiscussion between them before they came to this conclusion, during\r\nwhich the staring Rob paid close attention to both speakers, and\r\ninclined his ear to each by turns, as if he were appointed arbitrator\r\nof the argument.\r\n\r\nIn time, Rob was despatched for a coach, the visitors keeping shop\r\nmeanwhile; and when he brought it, they got into it, leaving word for\r\nUncle Sol that they would be sure to call again, on their way back. Rob\r\nhaving stared after the coach until it was as invisible as the pigeons\r\nhad now become, sat down behind the desk with a most assiduous\r\ndemeanour; and in order that he might forget nothing of what had\r\ntranspired, made notes of it on various small scraps of paper, with a\r\nvast expenditure of ink. There was no danger of these documents\r\nbetraying anything, if accidentally lost; for long before a word was\r\ndry, it became as profound a mystery to Rob, as if he had had no part\r\nwhatever in its production.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet busy with these labours, the hackney-coach, after\r\nencountering unheard-of difficulties from swivel-bridges, soft roads,\r\nimpassable canals, caravans of casks, settlements of scarlet-beans and\r\nlittle wash-houses, and many such obstacles abounding in that country,\r\nstopped at the corner of Brig Place. Alighting here, Florence and Susan\r\nNipper walked down the street, and sought out the abode of Captain\r\nCuttle.\r\n\r\nIt happened by evil chance to be one of Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s great cleaning\r\ndays. On these occasions, Mrs MacStinger was knocked up by the\r\npoliceman at a quarter before three in the morning, and rarely\r\nsuccumbed before twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock next night. The chief object of this\r\ninstitution appeared to be, that Mrs MacStinger should move all the\r\nfurniture into the back garden at early dawn, walk about the house in\r\npattens all day, and move the furniture back again after dark. These\r\nceremonies greatly fluttered those doves the young MacStingers, who\r\nwere not only unable at such times to find any resting-place for the\r\nsoles of their feet, but generally came in for a good deal of pecking\r\nfrom the maternal bird during the progress of the solemnities.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Florence and Susan Nipper presented themselves at\r\nMrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s door, that worthy but redoubtable female was in the\r\nact of conveying Alexander MacStinger, aged two years and three months,\r\nalong the passage, for forcible deposition in a sitting posture on the\r\nstreet pavement: Alexander being black in the face with holding his\r\nbreath after punishment, and a cool paving-stone being usually found to\r\nact as a powerful restorative in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of Mrs MacStinger, as a woman and a mother, were outraged\r\nby the look of pity for Alexander which she observed on Florence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. Therefore, Mrs MacStinger asserting those finest emotions of our\r\nnature, in preference to weakly gratifying her curiosity, shook and\r\nbuffeted Alexander both before and during the application of the\r\npaving-stone, and took no further notice of the strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, when the child had found his\r\nbreath again, and was using it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Number Nine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Number Nine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger.\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper instantly struck in, and begged to inquire what Mrs\r\nMacStinger meant by that, and if she knew whom she was talking to.\r\n\r\nMrs MacStinger in retort, looked at her all over. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want\r\nwith Captain Cuttle, I should wish to know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you? Then I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss\r\nNipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Susan! If you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you can have the\r\ngoodness to tell us where Captain Cuttle lives, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am as he don\xe2\x80\x99t live\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says he don\xe2\x80\x99t live here?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the implacable MacStinger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x94and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t his house\xe2\x80\x94and forbid\r\nit, that it ever should be his house\xe2\x80\x94for Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nto keep a house\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to have a house\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my house\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen I let the upper floor to Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, oh I do a thankless thing,\r\nand cast pearls before swine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs MacStinger pitched her voice for the upper windows in offering\r\nthese remarks, and cracked off each clause sharply by itself as if from\r\na rifle possessing an infinity of barrels. After the last shot, the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard to say, in feeble remonstrance from his own\r\nroom, \xe2\x80\x9cSteady below!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you want Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, there he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, with\r\nan angry motion of her hand. On Florence making bold to enter, without\r\nany more parley, and on Susan following, Mrs MacStinger recommenced her\r\npedestrian exercise in pattens, and Alexander MacStinger (still on the\r\npaving-stone), who had stopped in his crying to attend to the\r\nconversation, began to wail again, entertaining himself during that\r\ndismal performance, which was quite mechanical, with a general survey\r\nof the prospect, terminating in the hackney-coach.\r\n\r\nThe Captain in his own apartment was sitting with his hands in his\r\npockets and his legs drawn up under his chair, on a very small desolate\r\nisland, lying about midway in an ocean of soap and water. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindows had been cleaned, the walls had been cleaned, the stove had\r\nbeen cleaned, and everything the stove excepted, was wet, and shining\r\nwith soft soap and sand: the smell of which dry-saltery impregnated the\r\nair. In the midst of the dreary scene, the Captain, cast away upon his\r\nisland, looked round on the waste of waters with a rueful countenance,\r\nand seemed waiting for some friendly bark to come that way, and take\r\nhim off.\r\n\r\nBut when the Captain, directing his forlorn visage towards the door,\r\nsaw Florence appear with her maid, no words can describe his\r\nastonishment. Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence having rendered all other\r\nsounds but imperfectly distinguishable, he had looked for no rarer\r\nvisitor than the potboy or the milkman; wherefore, when Florence\r\nappeared, and coming to the confines of the island, put her hand in\r\nhis, the Captain stood up, aghast, as if he supposed her, for the\r\nmoment, to be some young member of the Flying Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\nInstantly recovering his self-possession, however, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\ncare was to place her on dry land, which he happily accomplished, with\r\none motion of his arm. Issuing forth, then, upon the main, Captain\r\nCuttle took Miss Nipper round the waist, and bore her to the island\r\nalso. Captain Cuttle, then, with great respect and admiration, raised\r\nthe hand of Florence to his lips, and standing off a little (for the\r\nisland was not large enough for three), beamed on her from the soap and\r\nwater like a new description of Triton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are amazed to see us, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe inexpressibly gratified Captain kissed his hook in reply, and\r\ngrowled, as if a choice and delicate compliment were included in the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cStand by! Stand by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout coming to ask you what\r\nyou think about dear Walter\xe2\x80\x94who is my brother now\xe2\x80\x94and whether there is\r\nanything to fear, and whether you will not go and console his poor\r\nUncle every day, until we have some intelligence of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Captain Cuttle, as by an involuntary gesture, clapped\r\nhis hand to his head, on which the hard glazed hat was not, and looked\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any fears for Walter\xe2\x80\x99s safety?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence, from whose\r\nface the Captain (so enraptured he was with it) could not take his\r\neyes: while she, in her turn, looked earnestly at him, to be assured of\r\nthe sincerity of his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Heart\xe2\x80\x99s-delight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not afeard. Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr is\r\na lad as\xe2\x80\x99ll go through a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 hard weather. Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr is a lad as\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring as much success to that \xe2\x80\x9cere brig as a lad is capable on. Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain, his eyes glistening with the praise of his young\r\nfriend, and his hook raised to announce a beautiful quotation, \xe2\x80\x9cis what\r\nyou may call a out\xe2\x80\x99ard and visible sign of an in\xe2\x80\x99ard and spirited\r\ngrasp, and when found make a note of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence, who did not quite understand this, though the Captain\r\nevidently thought it full of meaning, and highly satisfactory, mildly\r\nlooked to him for something more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afeard, my Heart\xe2\x80\x99s-delight,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen most uncommon bad weather in them latitudes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denyin\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nand they have drove and drove and been beat off, may be t\xe2\x80\x99other side\r\nthe world. But the ship\xe2\x80\x99s a good ship, and the lad\xe2\x80\x99s a good lad; and it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t easy, thank the Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain made a little bow, \xe2\x80\x9cto break\r\nup hearts of oak, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re in brigs or buzzums. Here we have \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nboth ways, which is bringing it up with a round turn, and so I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nbit afeard as yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs yet?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, kissing his iron hand; \xe2\x80\x9cand afore I\r\nbegin to be, my Hearts-delight, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr will have wrote home from the\r\nisland, or from some port or another, and made all taut and\r\nship-shape.\xe2\x80\x9d And with regard to old Sol Gills, here the Captain became\r\nsolemn, \xe2\x80\x9cwho I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by, and not desert until death do us part, and\r\nwhen the stormy winds do blow, do blow, do blow\xe2\x80\x94overhaul the\r\nCatechism,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain parenthetically, \xe2\x80\x9cand there you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nthem expressions\xe2\x80\x94if it would console Sol Gills to have the opinion of a\r\nseafaring man as has got a mind equal to any undertaking that he puts\r\nit alongside of, and as was all but smashed in his \xe2\x80\x9cprenticeship, and\r\nof which the name is Bunsby, that \xe2\x80\x9cere man shall give him such an\r\nopinion in his own parlour as\xe2\x80\x99ll stun him. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle,\r\nvauntingly, \xe2\x80\x9cas much as if he\xe2\x80\x99d gone and knocked his head again a\r\ndoor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us take this gentleman to see him, and let us hear what he says,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with us now? We have a coach here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Captain clapped his hand to his head, on which the hard\r\nglazed hat was not, and looked discomfited. But at this instant a most\r\nremarkable phenomenon occurred. The door opening, without any note of\r\npreparation, and apparently of itself, the hard glazed hat in question\r\nskimmed into the room like a bird, and alighted heavily at the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s feet. The door then shut as violently as it had opened, and\r\nnothing ensued in explanation of the prodigy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle picked up his hat, and having turned it over with a look\r\nof interest and welcome, began to polish it on his sleeve. While doing\r\nso, the Captain eyed his visitors intently, and said in a low voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I should have bore down on Sol Gills yesterday, and this\r\nmorning, but she\xe2\x80\x94she took it away and kept it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the long and\r\nshort of the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did, for goodness sake?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan Nipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady of the house, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, in a gruff\r\nwhisper, and making signals of secrecy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had some words about the\r\nswabbing of these here planks, and she\xe2\x80\x94In short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\neyeing the door, and relieving himself with a long breath, \xe2\x80\x9cshe stopped\r\nmy liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I wish she had me to deal with!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, reddening with the\r\nenergy of the wish. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d stop her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, do you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Captain, shaking his head\r\ndoubtfully, but regarding the desperate courage of the fair aspirant\r\nwith obvious admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult navigation.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to carry on with, my dear. You never can tell how\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll head, you see. She\xe2\x80\x99s full one minute, and round upon you next.\r\nAnd when she in a tartar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, with the perspiration\r\nbreaking out upon his forehead. There was nothing but a whistle\r\nemphatic enough for the conclusion of the sentence, so the Captain\r\nwhistled tremulously. After which he again shook his head, and\r\nrecurring to his admiration of Miss Nipper\xe2\x80\x99s devoted bravery, timidly\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you, do you think, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan only replied with a bridling smile, but that was so very full of\r\ndefiance, that there is no knowing how long Captain Cuttle might have\r\nstood entranced in its contemplation, if Florence in her anxiety had\r\nnot again proposed their immediately resorting to the oracular Bunsby.\r\nThus reminded of his duty, Captain Cuttle put on the glazed hat firmly,\r\ntook up another knobby stick, with which he had supplied the place of\r\nthat one given to Walter, and offering his arm to Florence, prepared to\r\ncut his way through the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt turned out, however, that Mrs MacStinger had already changed her\r\ncourse, and that she headed, as the Captain had remarked she often did,\r\nin quite a new direction. For when they got downstairs, they found that\r\nexemplary woman beating the mats on the doorsteps, with Alexander,\r\nstill upon the paving-stone, dimly looming through a fog of dust; and\r\nso absorbed was Mrs MacStinger in her household occupation, that when\r\nCaptain Cuttle and his visitors passed, she beat the harder, and\r\nneither by word nor gesture showed any consciousness of their vicinity.\r\nThe Captain was so well pleased with this easy escape\xe2\x80\x94although the\r\neffect of the door-mats on him was like a copious administration of\r\nsnuff, and made him sneeze until the tears ran down his face\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\ncould hardly believe his good fortune; but more than once, between the\r\ndoor and the hackney-coach, looked over his shoulder, with an obvious\r\napprehension of Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s giving chase yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, they got to the corner of Brig Place without any molestation\r\nfrom that terrible fire-ship; and the Captain mounting the\r\ncoach-box\xe2\x80\x94for his gallantry would not allow him to ride inside with the\r\nladies, though besought to do so\xe2\x80\x94piloted the driver on his course for\r\nCaptain Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s vessel, which was called the Cautious Clara, and was\r\nlying hard by Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\nArrived at the wharf off which this great commander\xe2\x80\x99s ship was jammed\r\nin among some five hundred companions, whose tangled rigging looked\r\nlike monstrous cobwebs half swept down, Captain Cuttle appeared at the\r\ncoach-window, and invited Florence and Miss Nipper to accompany him on\r\nboard; observing that Bunsby was to the last degree soft-hearted in\r\nrespect of ladies, and that nothing would so much tend to bring his\r\nexpansive intellect into a state of harmony as their presentation to\r\nthe Cautious Clara.\r\n\r\nFlorence readily consented; and the Captain, taking her little hand in\r\nhis prodigious palm, led her, with a mixed expression of patronage,\r\npaternity, pride, and ceremony, that was pleasant to see, over several\r\nvery dirty decks, until, coming to the Clara, they found that cautious\r\ncraft (which lay outside the tier) with her gangway removed, and\r\nhalf-a-dozen feet of river interposed between herself and her nearest\r\nneighbour. It appeared, from Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, that the\r\ngreat Bunsby, like himself, was cruelly treated by his landlady, and\r\nthat when her usage of him for the time being was so hard that he could\r\nbear it no longer, he set this gulf between them as a last resource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClara a-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, putting a hand to each side of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a boy, like the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s echo, tumbling up from below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby aboard?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, hailing the boy in a stentorian\r\nvoice, as if he were half-a-mile off instead of two yards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy, in the same tone.\r\n\r\nThe boy then shoved out a plank to Captain Cuttle, who adjusted it\r\ncarefully, and led Florence across: returning presently for Miss\r\nNipper. So they stood upon the deck of the Cautious Clara, in whose\r\nstanding rigging, divers fluttering articles of dress were curing, in\r\ncompany with a few tongues and some mackerel.\r\n\r\nImmediately there appeared, coming slowly up above the bulk-head of the\r\ncabin, another bulk-head\xe2\x80\x94human, and very large\xe2\x80\x94with one stationary eye\r\nin the mahogany face, and one revolving one, on the principle of some\r\nlighthouses. This head was decorated with shaggy hair, like oakum,\r\nwhich had no governing inclination towards the north, east, west, or\r\nsouth, but inclined to all four quarters of the compass, and to every\r\npoint upon it. The head was followed by a perfect desert of chin, and\r\nby a shirt-collar and neckerchief, and by a dreadnought pilot-coat, and\r\nby a pair of dreadnought pilot-trousers, whereof the waistband was so\r\nvery broad and high, that it became a succedaneum for a waistcoat:\r\nbeing ornamented near the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s breastbone with some massive wooden\r\nbuttons, like backgammon men. As the lower portions of these pantaloons\r\nbecame revealed, Bunsby stood confessed; his hands in their pockets,\r\nwhich were of vast size; and his gaze directed, not to Captain Cuttle\r\nor the ladies, but the mast-head.\r\n\r\nThe profound appearance of this philosopher, who was bulky and strong,\r\nand on whose extremely red face an expression of taciturnity sat\r\nenthroned, not inconsistent with his character, in which that quality\r\nwas proudly conspicuous, almost daunted Captain Cuttle, though on\r\nfamiliar terms with him. Whispering to Florence that Bunsby had never\r\nin his life expressed surprise, and was considered not to know what it\r\nmeant, the Captain watched him as he eyed his mast-head, and afterwards\r\nswept the horizon; and when the revolving eye seemed to be coming round\r\nin his direction, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby, my lad, how fares it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep, gruff, husky utterance, which seemed to have no connexion with\r\nBunsby, and certainly had not the least effect upon his face, replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, shipmet, how goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s right hand\r\nand arm, emerging from a pocket, shook the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s, and went back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, striking home at once, \xe2\x80\x9chere you are; a man\r\nof mind, and a man as can give an opinion. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a young lady as wants\r\nto take that opinion, in regard of my friend Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr; likewise my t\xe2\x80\x99other\r\nfriend, Sol Gills, which is a character for you to come within hail of,\r\nbeing a man of science, which is the mother of invention, and knows no\r\nlaw. Bunsby, will you wear, to oblige me, and come along with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe great commander, who seemed by expression of his visage to be\r\nalways on the look-out for something in the extremest distance, and to\r\nhave no ocular knowledge of anything within ten miles, made no reply\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, addressing himself to his fair\r\nauditors, and indicating the commander with his outstretched hook,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat has fell down, more than any man alive; that has had more\r\naccidents happen to his own self than the Seamen\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital to all\r\nhands; that took as many spars and bars and bolts about the outside of\r\nhis head when he was young, as you\xe2\x80\x99d want a order for on Chatham-yard\r\nto build a pleasure yacht with; and yet that his opinions in that way,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s my belief, for there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing like \xe2\x80\x99em afloat or ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stolid commander appeared by a very slight vibration in his elbows,\r\nto express some satisfaction in this encomium; but if his face had been\r\nas distant as his gaze was, it could hardly have enlightened the\r\nbeholders less in reference to anything that was passing in his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShipmet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunsby, all of a sudden, and stooping down to look out\r\nunder some interposing spar, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll the ladies drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, whose delicacy was shocked by such an inquiry in\r\nconnection with Florence, drew the sage aside, and seeming to explain\r\nin his ear, accompanied him below; where, that he might not take\r\noffence, the Captain drank a dram himself, which Florence and Susan,\r\nglancing down the open skylight, saw the sage, with difficulty finding\r\nroom for himself between his berth and a very little brass fireplace,\r\nserve out for self and friend. They soon reappeared on deck, and\r\nCaptain Cuttle, triumphing in the success of his enterprise, conducted\r\nFlorence back to the coach, while Bunsby followed, escorting Miss\r\nNipper, whom he hugged upon the way (much to that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation) with his pilot-coated arm, like a blue bear.\r\n\r\nThe Captain put his oracle inside, and gloried so much in having\r\nsecured him, and having got that mind into a hackney-coach, that he\r\ncould not refrain from often peeping in at Florence through the little\r\nwindow behind the driver, and testifying his delight in smiles, and\r\nalso in taps upon his forehead, to hint to her that the brain of Bunsby\r\nwas hard at it. In the meantime, Bunsby, still hugging Miss Nipper (for\r\nhis friend, the Captain, had not exaggerated the softness of his\r\nheart), uniformly preserved his gravity of deportment, and showed no\r\nother consciousness of her or anything.\r\n\r\nUncle Sol, who had come home, received them at the door, and ushered\r\nthem immediately into the little back parlour: strangely altered by the\r\nabsence of Walter. On the table, and about the room, were the charts\r\nand maps on which the heavy-hearted Instrument-maker had again and\r\nagain tracked the missing vessel across the sea, and on which, with a\r\npair of compasses that he still had in his hand, he had been measuring,\r\na minute before, how far she must have driven, to have driven here or\r\nthere: and trying to demonstrate that a long time must elapse before\r\nhope was exhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether she can have run,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Sol, looking wistfully over the\r\nchart; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no, that\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible or whether she can have been\r\nforced by stress of weather,\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s not reasonably likely. Or\r\nwhether there is any hope she so far changed her course as\xe2\x80\x94but even I\r\ncan hardly hope that!\xe2\x80\x9d With such broken suggestions, poor old Uncle Sol\r\nroamed over the great sheet before him, and could not find a speck of\r\nhopeful probability in it large enough to set one small point of the\r\ncompasses upon.\r\n\r\nFlorence saw immediately\xe2\x80\x94it would have been difficult to help\r\nseeing\xe2\x80\x94that there was a singular, indescribable change in the old man,\r\nand that while his manner was far more restless and unsettled than\r\nusual, there was yet a curious, contradictory decision in it, that\r\nperplexed her very much. She fancied once that he spoke wildly, and at\r\nrandom; for on her saying she regretted not to have seen him when she\r\nhad been there before that morning, he at first replied that he had\r\nbeen to see her, and directly afterwards seemed to wish to recall that\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cToday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Uncle Sol, looking at her and away\r\nfrom her in a confused manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI wished to see you with my own eyes,\r\nand to hear you with my own ears, once more before\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d There he stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore when? Before what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, putting her hand upon his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I say \xe2\x80\x98before?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied old Sol. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I did, I must have meant\r\nbefore we should have news of my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been so very\r\nanxious I am sure you are not well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man, shutting up his right hand, and\r\nholding it out to show her: \xe2\x80\x9cas well and firm as any man at my time of\r\nlife can hope to be. See! It\xe2\x80\x99s steady. Is its master not as capable of\r\nresolution and fortitude as many a younger man? I think so. We shall\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was that in his manner more than in his words, though they\r\nremained with her too, which impressed Florence so much, that she would\r\nhave confided her uneasiness to Captain Cuttle at that moment, if the\r\nCaptain had not seized that moment for expounding the state of\r\ncircumstance, on which the opinion of the sagacious Bunsby was\r\nrequested, and entreating that profound authority to deliver the same.\r\n\r\nBunsby, whose eye continued to be addressed to somewhere about the\r\nhalf-way house between London and Gravesend, two or three times put out\r\nhis rough right arm, as seeking to wind it for inspiration round the\r\nfair form of Miss Nipper; but that young female having withdrawn\r\nherself, in displeasure, to the opposite side of the table, the soft\r\nheart of the Commander of the Cautious Clara met with no response to\r\nits impulses. After sundry failures in this wise, the Commander,\r\naddressing himself to nobody, thus spake; or rather the voice within\r\nhim said of its own accord, and quite independent of himself, as if he\r\nwere possessed by a gruff spirit:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Bunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was christened John,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the delighted Captain Cuttle. \xe2\x80\x9cHear\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I says,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the voice, after some deliberation, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstands to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, with Florence on his arm, nodded at the auditory, and\r\nseemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow he\xe2\x80\x99s coming out. This is what I meant when I\r\nbrought him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereby,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not? If so, what odds? Can any man\r\nsay otherwise? No. Awast then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen it had pursued its train of argument to this point, the voice\r\nstopped, and rested. It then proceeded very slowly, thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I believe that this here Son and Heir\xe2\x80\x99s gone down, my lads? Mayhap.\r\nDo I say so? Which? If a skipper stands out by Sen\xe2\x80\x99 George\xe2\x80\x99s Channel,\r\nmaking for the Downs, what\xe2\x80\x99s right ahead of him? The Goodwins. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforced to run upon the Goodwins, but he may. The bearings of this\r\nobservation lays in the application on it. That ain\xe2\x80\x99t no part of my\r\nduty. Awast then, keep a bright look-out for\xe2\x80\x99ard, and good luck to\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice here went out of the back parlour and into the street, taking\r\nthe Commander of the Cautious Clara with it, and accompanying him on\r\nboard again with all convenient expedition, where he immediately turned\r\nin, and refreshed his mind with a nap.\r\n\r\nThe students of the sage\xe2\x80\x99s precepts, left to their own application of\r\nhis wisdom\xe2\x80\x94upon a principle which was the main leg of the Bunsby\r\ntripod, as it is perchance of some other oracular stools\xe2\x80\x94looked upon\r\none another in a little uncertainty; while Rob the Grinder, who had\r\ntaken the innocent freedom of peering in, and listening, through the\r\nskylight in the roof, came softly down from the leads, in a state of\r\nvery dense confusion. Captain Cuttle, however, whose admiration of\r\nBunsby was, if possible, enhanced by the splendid manner in which he\r\nhad justified his reputation and come through this solemn reference,\r\nproceeded to explain that Bunsby meant nothing but confidence; that\r\nBunsby had no misgivings; and that such an opinion as that man had\r\ngiven, coming from such a mind as his, was Hope\xe2\x80\x99s own anchor, with good\r\nroads to cast it in. Florence endeavoured to believe that the Captain\r\nwas right; but the Nipper, with her arms tight folded, shook her head\r\nin resolute denial, and had no more trust in Bunsby than in Mr Perch\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher seemed to have left Uncle Sol pretty much where he had\r\nfound him, for he still went roaming about the watery world, compasses\r\nin hand, and discovering no rest for them. It was in pursuance of a\r\nwhisper in his ear from Florence, while the old man was absorbed in\r\nthis pursuit, that Captain Cuttle laid his heavy hand upon his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer, Sol Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut so-so, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Instrument-maker. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nremembering, all this afternoon, that on the very day when my boy\r\nentered Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House, and came home late to dinner, sitting just\r\nthere where you stand, we talked of storm and shipwreck, and I could\r\nhardly turn him from the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut meeting the eyes of Florence, which were fixed with earnest\r\nscrutiny upon his face, the old man stopped and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by, old friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cLook alive! I tell you\r\nwhat, Sol Gills; arter I\xe2\x80\x99ve convoyed Heart\xe2\x80\x99s-delight safe home,\xe2\x80\x9d here\r\nthe Captain kissed his hook to Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back and take you\r\nin tow for the rest of this blessed day. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come and eat your\r\ndinner along with me, Sol, somewheres or another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot today, Ned!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man quickly, and appearing to be\r\nunaccountably startled by the proposition. \xe2\x80\x9cNot today. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, gazing at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I have so much to do. I\xe2\x80\x94I mean to think of, and arrange. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it, Ned, indeed. I must go out again, and be alone, and turn my mind\r\nto many things today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked at the Instrument-maker, and looked at Florence, and\r\nagain at the Instrument-maker. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. To-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of me to-morrow. Say\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come here early, mind, Sol Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d stipulated the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. The first thing tomorrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Sol; \xe2\x80\x9cand now\r\ngood-bye, Ned Cuttle, and God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSqueezing both the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s hands, with uncommon fervour, as he said\r\nit, the old man turned to Florence, folded hers in his own, and put\r\nthem to his lips; then hurried her out to the coach with very singular\r\nprecipitation. Altogether, he made such an effect on Captain Cuttle\r\nthat the Captain lingered behind, and instructed Rob to be particularly\r\ngentle and attentive to his master until the morning: which injunction\r\nhe strengthened with the payment of one shilling down, and the promise\r\nof another sixpence before noon next day. This kind office performed,\r\nCaptain Cuttle, who considered himself the natural and lawful\r\nbody-guard of Florence, mounted the box with a mighty sense of his\r\ntrust, and escorted her home. At parting, he assured her that he would\r\nstand by Sol Gills, close and true; and once again inquired of Susan\r\nNipper, unable to forget her gallant words in reference to Mrs\r\nMacStinger, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you, do you think my dear, though?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the desolate house had closed upon the two, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nreverted to the old Instrument-maker, and he felt uncomfortable.\r\nTherefore, instead of going home, he walked up and down the street\r\nseveral times, and, eking out his leisure until evening, dined late at\r\na certain angular little tavern in the City, with a public parlour like\r\na wedge, to which glazed hats much resorted. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s principal\r\nintention was to pass Sol Gills\xe2\x80\x99s, after dark, and look in through the\r\nwindow: which he did, The parlour door stood open, and he could see his\r\nold friend writing busily and steadily at the table within, while the\r\nlittle Midshipman, already sheltered from the night dews, watched him\r\nfrom the counter; under which Rob the Grinder made his own bed,\r\npreparatory to shutting the shop. Reassured by the tranquillity that\r\nreigned within the precincts of the wooden mariner, the Captain headed\r\nfor Brig Place, resolving to weigh anchor betimes in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nThe Study of a Loving Heart\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Barnet and Lady Skettles, very good people, resided in a pretty\r\nvilla at Fulham, on the banks of the Thames; which was one of the most\r\ndesirable residences in the world when a rowing-match happened to be\r\ngoing past, but had its little inconveniences at other times, among\r\nwhich may be enumerated the occasional appearance of the river in the\r\ndrawing-room, and the contemporaneous disappearance of the lawn and\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\nSir Barnet Skettles expressed his personal consequence chiefly through\r\nan antique gold snuffbox, and a ponderous silk pocket-kerchief, which\r\nhe had an imposing manner of drawing out of his pocket like a banner\r\nand using with both hands at once. Sir Barnet\xe2\x80\x99s object in life was\r\nconstantly to extend the range of his acquaintance. Like a heavy body\r\ndropped into water\xe2\x80\x94not to disparage so worthy a gentleman by the\r\ncomparison\xe2\x80\x94it was in the nature of things that Sir Barnet must spread\r\nan ever widening circle about him, until there was no room left. Or,\r\nlike a sound in air, the vibration of which, according to the\r\nspeculation of an ingenious modern philosopher, may go on travelling\r\nfor ever through the interminable fields of space, nothing but coming\r\nto the end of his moral tether could stop Sir Barnet Skettles in his\r\nvoyage of discovery through the social system.\r\n\r\nSir Barnet was proud of making people acquainted with people. He liked\r\nthe thing for its own sake, and it advanced his favourite object too.\r\nFor example, if Sir Barnet had the good fortune to get hold of a law\r\nrecruit, or a country gentleman, and ensnared him to his hospitable\r\nvilla, Sir Barnet would say to him, on the morning after his arrival,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dear Sir, is there anybody you would like to know? Who is\r\nthere you would wish to meet? Do you take any interest in writing\r\npeople, or in painting or sculpturing people, or in acting people, or\r\nin anything of that sort?\xe2\x80\x9d Possibly the patient answered yes, and\r\nmentioned somebody, of whom Sir Barnet had no more personal knowledge\r\nthan of Ptolemy the Great. Sir Barnet replied, that nothing on earth\r\nwas easier, as he knew him very well: immediately called on the\r\naforesaid somebody, left his card, wrote a short note,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nSir\xe2\x80\x94penalty of your eminent position\xe2\x80\x94friend at my house naturally\r\ndesirous\xe2\x80\x94Lady Skettles and myself participate\xe2\x80\x94trust that genius being\r\nsuperior to ceremonies, you will do us the distinguished favour of\r\ngiving us the pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d etc, etc.\xe2\x80\x94and so killed a brace of birds with\r\none stone, dead as door-nails.\r\n\r\nWith the snuff-box and banner in full force, Sir Barnet Skettles\r\npropounded his usual inquiry to Florence on the first morning of her\r\nvisit. When Florence thanked him, and said there was no one in\r\nparticular whom she desired to see, it was natural she should think\r\nwith a pang, of poor lost Walter. When Sir Barnet Skettles, urging his\r\nkind offer, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Dombey, are you sure you can remember\r\nno one whom your good Papa\xe2\x80\x94to whom I beg you present the best\r\ncompliments of myself and Lady Skettles when you write\xe2\x80\x94might wish you\r\nto know?\xe2\x80\x9d it was natural, perhaps, that her poor head should droop a\r\nlittle, and that her voice should tremble as it softly answered in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nSkettles Junior, much stiffened as to his cravat, and sobered down as\r\nto his spirits, was at home for the holidays, and appeared to feel\r\nhimself aggrieved by the solicitude of his excellent mother that he\r\nshould be attentive to Florence. Another and a deeper injury under\r\nwhich the soul of young Barnet chafed, was the company of Dr and Mrs\r\nBlimber, who had been invited on a visit to the paternal roof-tree, and\r\nof whom the young gentleman often said he would have preferred their\r\npassing the vacation at Jericho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anybody you can suggest now, Doctor Blimber?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Barnet\r\nSkettles, turning to that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, Sir Barnet,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Doctor Blimber. \xe2\x80\x9cReally I am\r\nnot aware that there is, in particular. I like to know my fellow-men in\r\ngeneral, Sir Barnet. What does Terence say? Anyone who is the parent of\r\na son is interesting to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs Blimber any wish to see any remarkable person?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir\r\nBarnet, courteously.\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber replied, with a sweet smile and a shake of her sky-blue\r\ncap, that if Sir Barnet could have made her known to Cicero, she would\r\nhave troubled him; but such an introduction not being feasible, and she\r\nalready enjoying the friendship of himself and his amiable lady, and\r\npossessing with the Doctor her husband their joint confidence in regard\r\nto their dear son\xe2\x80\x94here young Barnet was observed to curl his nose\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nasked no more.\r\n\r\nSir Barnet was fain, under these circumstances, to content himself for\r\nthe time with the company assembled. Florence was glad of that; for she\r\nhad a study to pursue among them, and it lay too near her heart, and\r\nwas too precious and momentous, to yield to any other interest.\r\n\r\nThere were some children staying in the house. Children who were as\r\nfrank and happy with fathers and with mothers as those rosy faces\r\nopposite home. Children who had no restraint upon their love, and\r\nfreely showed it. Florence sought to learn their secret; sought to find\r\nout what it was she had missed; what simple art they knew, and she knew\r\nnot; how she could be taught by them to show her father that she loved\r\nhim, and to win his love again.\r\n\r\nMany a day did Florence thoughtfully observe these children. On many a\r\nbright morning did she leave her bed when the glorious sun rose, and\r\nwalking up and down upon the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank, before anyone in the house\r\nwas stirring, look up at the windows of their rooms, and think of them,\r\nasleep, so gently tended and affectionately thought of. Florence would\r\nfeel more lonely then, than in the great house all alone; and would\r\nthink sometimes that she was better there than here, and that there was\r\ngreater peace in hiding herself than in mingling with others of her\r\nage, and finding how unlike them all she was. But attentive to her\r\nstudy, though it touched her to the quick at every little leaf she\r\nturned in the hard book, Florence remained among them, and tried, with\r\npatient hope, to gain the knowledge that she wearied for.\r\n\r\nAh! how to gain it! how to know the charm in its beginning! There were\r\ndaughters here, who rose up in the morning, and lay down to rest at\r\nnight, possessed of fathers\xe2\x80\x99 hearts already. They had no repulse to\r\novercome, no coldness to dread, no frown to smooth away. As the morning\r\nadvanced, and the windows opened one by one, and the dew began to dry\r\nupon the flowers and youthful feet began to move upon the lawn,\r\nFlorence, glancing round at the bright faces, thought what was there\r\nshe could learn from these children? It was too late to learn from\r\nthem; each could approach her father fearlessly, and put up her lips to\r\nmeet the ready kiss, and wind her arm about the neck that bent down to\r\ncaress her. She could not begin by being so bold. Oh! could it be that\r\nthere was less and less hope as she studied more and more!\r\n\r\nShe remembered well, that even the old woman who had robbed her when a\r\nlittle child\xe2\x80\x94whose image and whose house, and all she had said and\r\ndone, were stamped upon her recollection, with the enduring sharpness\r\nof a fearful impression made at that early period of life\xe2\x80\x94had spoken\r\nfondly of her daughter, and how terribly even she had cried out in the\r\npain of hopeless separation from her child. But her own mother, she\r\nwould think again, when she recalled this, had loved her well. Then,\r\nsometimes, when her thoughts reverted swiftly to the void between\r\nherself and her father, Florence would tremble, and the tears would\r\nstart upon her face, as she pictured to herself her mother living on,\r\nand coming also to dislike her, because of her wanting the unknown\r\ngrace that should conciliate that father naturally, and had never done\r\nso from her cradle. She knew that this imagination did wrong to her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and had no truth in it, or base to rest upon; and yet\r\nshe tried so hard to justify him, and to find the whole blame in\r\nherself, that she could not resist its passing, like a wild cloud,\r\nthrough the distance of her mind.\r\n\r\nThere came among the other visitors, soon after Florence, one beautiful\r\ngirl, three or four years younger than she, who was an orphan child,\r\nand who was accompanied by her aunt, a grey-haired lady, who spoke much\r\nto Florence, and who greatly liked (but that they all did) to hear her\r\nsing of an evening, and would always sit near her at that time, with\r\nmotherly interest. They had only been two days in the house, when\r\nFlorence, being in an arbour in the garden one warm morning, musingly\r\nobservant of a youthful group upon the turf, through some intervening\r\nboughs,\xe2\x80\x94and wreathing flowers for the head of one little creature among\r\nthem who was the pet and plaything of the rest, heard this same lady\r\nand her niece, in pacing up and down a sheltered nook close by, speak\r\nof herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Florence an orphan like me, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my love. She has no mother, but her father is living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she in mourning for her poor Mama, now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the child\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for her only brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she no other brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little girl\r\n\r\nAs they stopped soon afterwards to watch some boats, and had been\r\nsilent in the meantime, Florence, who had risen when she heard her\r\nname, and had gathered up her flowers to go and meet them, that they\r\nmight know of her being within hearing, resumed her seat and work,\r\nexpecting to hear no more; but the conversation recommenced next\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence is a favourite with everyone here, and deserves to be, I am\r\nsure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is her Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aunt replied, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, that she did not know. Her\r\ntone of voice arrested Florence, who had started from her seat again;\r\nand held her fastened to the spot, with her work hastily caught up to\r\nher bosom, and her two hands saving it from being scattered on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in England, I hope, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so. Yes; I know he is, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he ever been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not. No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he coming here to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he lame, or blind, or ill, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child.\r\n\r\nThe flowers that Florence held to her breast began to fall when she\r\nheard those words, so wonderingly spoke. She held them closer; and her\r\nface hung down upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, after another moment of silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell\r\nyou the whole truth about Florence as I have heard it, and believe it\r\nto be. Tell no one else, my dear, because it may be little known here,\r\nand your doing so would give her pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never will!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you never will,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI can trust you as myself.\r\nI fear then, Kate, that Florence\xe2\x80\x99s father cares little for her, very\r\nseldom sees her, never was kind to her in her life, and now quite shuns\r\nher and avoids her. She would love him dearly if he would suffer her,\r\nbut he will not\xe2\x80\x94though for no fault of hers; and she is greatly to be\r\nloved and pitied by all gentle hearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore of the flowers that Florence held fell scattering on the ground;\r\nthose that remained were wet, but not with dew; and her face dropped\r\nupon her laden hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Florence! Dear, good Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why I have told you this, Kate?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I may be very kind to her, and take great care to try to please\r\nher. Is that the reason, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not all. Though we see her so cheerful;\r\nwith a pleasant smile for everyone; ready to oblige us all, and bearing\r\nher part in every amusement here: she can hardly be quite happy, do you\r\nthink she can, Kate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can understand,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy her observation of\r\nchildren who have parents who are fond of them, and proud of them\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nmany here, just now\xe2\x80\x94should make her sorrowful in secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that very well. Poor\r\nFlorence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore flowers strayed upon the ground, and those she yet held to her\r\nbreast trembled as if a wintry wind were rustling them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Kate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, whose voice was serious, but very calm and\r\nsweet, and had so impressed Florence from the first moment of her\r\nhearing it, \xe2\x80\x9cof all the youthful people here, you are her natural and\r\nharmless friend; you have not the innocent means, that happier children\r\nhave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are none happier, aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the child, who seemed to\r\ncling about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94As other children have, dear Kate, of reminding her of her\r\nmisfortune. Therefore I would have you, when you try to be her little\r\nfriend, try all the more for that, and feel that the bereavement you\r\nsustained\xe2\x80\x94thank Heaven! before you knew its weight\xe2\x80\x94gives you claim and\r\nhold upon poor Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not without a parent\xe2\x80\x99s love, aunt, and I never have been,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the child, \xe2\x80\x9cwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever that may be, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyour misfortune is\r\na lighter one than Florence\xe2\x80\x99s; for not an orphan in the wide world can\r\nbe so deserted as the child who is an outcast from a living parent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flowers were scattered on the ground like dust; the empty hands\r\nwere spread upon the face; and orphaned Florence, shrinking down upon\r\nthe ground, wept long and bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut true of heart and resolute in her good purpose, Florence held to it\r\nas her dying mother held by her upon the day that gave Paul life. He\r\ndid not know how much she loved him. However long the time in coming,\r\nand however slow the interval, she must try to bring that knowledge to\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s heart one day or other. Meantime she must be careful in no\r\nthoughtless word, or look, or burst of feeling awakened by any chance\r\ncircumstance, to complain against him, or to give occasion for these\r\nwhispers to his prejudice.\r\n\r\nEven in the response she made the orphan child, to whom she was\r\nattracted strongly, and whom she had such occasion to remember,\r\nFlorence was mindful of him. If she singled her out too plainly\r\n(Florence thought) from among the rest, she would confirm\xe2\x80\x94in one mind\r\ncertainly: perhaps in more\xe2\x80\x94the belief that he was cruel and unnatural.\r\nHer own delight was no set-off to this. What she had overheard was a\r\nreason, not for soothing herself, but for saving him; and Florence did\r\nit, in pursuance of the study of her heart.\r\n\r\nShe did so always. If a book were read aloud, and there were anything\r\nin the story that pointed at an unkind father, she was in pain for\r\ntheir application of it to him; not for herself. So with any trifle of\r\nan interlude that was acted, or picture that was shown, or game that\r\nwas played, among them. The occasions for such tenderness towards him\r\nwere so many, that her mind misgave her often, it would indeed be\r\nbetter to go back to the old house, and live again within the shadow of\r\nits dull walls, undisturbed. How few who saw sweet Florence, in her\r\nspring of womanhood, the modest little queen of those small revels,\r\nimagined what a load of sacred care lay heavy in her breast! How few of\r\nthose who stiffened in her father\xe2\x80\x99s freezing atmosphere, suspected what\r\na heap of fiery coals was piled upon his head!\r\n\r\nFlorence pursued her study patiently, and, failing to acquire the\r\nsecret of the nameless grace she sought, among the youthful company who\r\nwere assembled in the house, often walked out alone, in the early\r\nmorning, among the children of the poor. But still she found them all\r\ntoo far advanced to learn from. They had won their household places\r\nlong ago, and did not stand without, as she did, with a bar across the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThere was one man whom she several times observed at work very early,\r\nand often with a girl of about her own age seated near him. He was a\r\nvery poor man, who seemed to have no regular employment, but now went\r\nroaming about the banks of the river when the tide was low, looking out\r\nfor bits and scraps in the mud; and now worked at the unpromising\r\nlittle patch of garden-ground before his cottage; and now tinkered up a\r\nmiserable old boat that belonged to him; or did some job of that kind\r\nfor a neighbour, as chance occurred. Whatever the man\xe2\x80\x99s labour, the\r\ngirl was never employed; but sat, when she was with him, in a listless,\r\nmoping state, and idle.\r\n\r\nFlorence had often wished to speak to this man; yet she had never taken\r\ncourage to do so, as he made no movement towards her. But one morning\r\nwhen she happened to come upon him suddenly, from a by-path among some\r\npollard willows which terminated in the little shelving piece of stony\r\nground that lay between his dwelling and the water, where he was\r\nbending over a fire he had made to caulk the old boat which was lying\r\nbottom upwards, close by, he raised his head at the sound of her\r\nfootstep, and gave her Good morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, approaching nearer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are at work\r\nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to be often at work earlier, Miss, if I had work to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so hard to get?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find it so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man.\r\n\r\nFlorence glanced to where the girl was sitting, drawn together, with\r\nher elbows on her knees, and her chin on her hands, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his head quickly, and looking towards the girl with a\r\nbrightened face, nodded to her, and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Florence looked towards\r\nher too, and gave her a kind salutation; the girl muttered something in\r\nreturn, ungraciously and sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she in want of employment also?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI work for both,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there only you two, then?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly us two,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cHer mother has been dead these ten year.\r\nMartha!\xe2\x80\x9d (he lifted up his head again, and whistled to her) \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsay a word to the pretty young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl made an impatient gesture with her cowering shoulders, and\r\nturned her head another way. Ugly, misshapen, peevish, ill-conditioned,\r\nragged, dirty\xe2\x80\x94but beloved! Oh yes! Florence had seen her father\xe2\x80\x99s look\r\ntowards her, and she knew whose look it had no likeness to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she\xe2\x80\x99s worse this morning, my poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man,\r\nsuspending his work, and contemplating his ill-favoured child, with a\r\ncompassion that was the more tender for being rougher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is ill, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\nThe man drew a deep sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe my Martha\xe2\x80\x99s had five short\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 good health,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, looking at her still, \xe2\x80\x9cin as many long\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! and more than that, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said a neighbour, who had come down to\r\nhelp him with the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that, you say, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, pushing back his\r\nbattered hat, and drawing his hand across his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cVery like. It\r\nseems a long, long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the more the time,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the neighbour, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfavoured and humoured her, John, till she\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a burden to\r\nherself, and everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, falling to his work. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence could feel\xe2\x80\x94who better?\xe2\x80\x94how truly he spoke. She drew a little\r\ncloser to him, and would have been glad to touch his rugged hand, and\r\nthank him for his goodness to the miserable object that he looked upon\r\nwith eyes so different from any other man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho would favour my poor girl\xe2\x80\x94to call it favouring\xe2\x80\x94if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the neighbour. \xe2\x80\x9cIn reason, John. But you! You rob\r\nyourself to give to her. You bind yourself hand and foot on her\r\naccount. You make your life miserable along of her. And what does she\r\ncare! You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she knows it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father lifted up his head again, and whistled to her. Martha made\r\nthe same impatient gesture with her crouching shoulders, in reply; and\r\nhe was glad and happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for that, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the neighbour, with a smile, in which there\r\nwas more of secret sympathy than he expressed; \xe2\x80\x9conly to get that, he\r\nnever lets her out of his sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the day\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and has been coming a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nthe other, bending low over his work, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen to get half as much from\r\nthat unfort\xe2\x80\x99nate child of mine\xe2\x80\x94to get the trembling of a finger, or the\r\nwaving of a hair\xe2\x80\x94would be to raise the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence softly put some money near his hand on the old boat, and left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd now Florence began to think, if she were to fall ill, if she were\r\nto fade like her dear brother, would he then know that she had loved\r\nhim; would she then grow dear to him; would he come to her bedside,\r\nwhen she was weak and dim of sight, and take her into his embrace, and\r\ncancel all the past? Would he so forgive her, in that changed\r\ncondition, for not having been able to lay open her childish heart to\r\nhim, as to make it easy to relate with what emotions she had gone out\r\nof his room that night; what she had meant to say if she had had the\r\ncourage; and how she had endeavoured, afterwards, to learn the way she\r\nnever knew in infancy?\r\n\r\nYes, she thought if she were dying, he would relent. She thought, that\r\nif she lay, serene and not unwilling to depart, upon the bed that was\r\ncurtained round with recollections of their darling boy, he would be\r\ntouched home, and would say, \xe2\x80\x9cDear Florence, live for me, and we will\r\nlove each other as we might have done, and be as happy as we might have\r\nbeen these many years!\xe2\x80\x9d She thought that if she heard such words from\r\nhim, and had her arms clasped round him, she could answer with a smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late for anything but this; I never could be happier, dear\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d and so leave him, with a blessing on her lips.\r\n\r\nThe golden water she remembered on the wall, appeared to Florence, in\r\nthe light of such reflections, only as a current flowing on to rest,\r\nand to a region where the dear ones, gone before, were waiting, hand in\r\nhand; and often when she looked upon the darker river rippling at her\r\nfeet, she thought with awful wonder, but not terror, of that river\r\nwhich her brother had so often said was bearing him away.\r\n\r\nThe father and his sick daughter were yet fresh in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nand, indeed, that incident was not a week old, when Sir Barnet and his\r\nlady going out walking in the lanes one afternoon, proposed to her to\r\nbear them company. Florence readily consenting, Lady Skettles ordered\r\nout young Barnet as a matter of course. For nothing delighted Lady\r\nSkettles so much, as beholding her eldest son with Florence on his arm.\r\n\r\nBarnet, to say the truth, appeared to entertain an opposite sentiment\r\non the subject, and on such occasions frequently expressed himself\r\naudibly, though indefinitely, in reference to \xe2\x80\x9ca parcel of girls.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nit was not easy to ruffle her sweet temper, however, Florence generally\r\nreconciled the young gentleman to his fate after a few minutes, and\r\nthey strolled on amicably: Lady Skettles and Sir Barnet following, in a\r\nstate of perfect complacency and high gratification.\r\n\r\nThis was the order of procedure on the afternoon in question; and\r\nFlorence had almost succeeded in overruling the present objections of\r\nSkettles Junior to his destiny, when a gentleman on horseback came\r\nriding by, looked at them earnestly as he passed, drew in his rein,\r\nwheeled round, and came riding back again, hat in hand.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had looked particularly at Florence; and when the little\r\nparty stopped, on his riding back, he bowed to her, before saluting Sir\r\nBarnet and his lady. Florence had no remembrance of having ever seen\r\nhim, but she started involuntarily when he came near her, and drew\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy horse is perfectly quiet, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nIt was not that, but something in the gentleman himself\xe2\x80\x94Florence could\r\nnot have said what\xe2\x80\x94that made her recoil as if she had been stung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honour to address Miss Dombey, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngentleman, with a most persuasive smile. On Florence inclining her\r\nhead, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Carker. I can hardly hope to be remembered\r\nby Miss Dombey, except by name. Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFlorence, sensible of a strange inclination to shiver, though the day\r\nwas hot, presented him to her host and hostess; by whom he was very\r\ngraciously received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand times! But I am going down\r\ntomorrow morning to Mr Dombey, at Leamington, and if Miss Dombey can\r\nentrust me with any commission, need I say how very happy I shall be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Barnet immediately divining that Florence would desire to write a\r\nletter to her father, proposed to return, and besought Mr Carker to\r\ncome home and dine in his riding gear. Mr Carker had the misfortune to\r\nbe engaged to dinner, but if Miss Dombey wished to write, nothing would\r\ndelight him more than to accompany them back, and to be her faithful\r\nslave in waiting as long as she pleased. As he said this with his\r\nwidest smile, and bent down close to her to pat his horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck,\r\nFlorence meeting his eyes, saw, rather than heard him say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\nnews of the ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConfused, frightened, shrinking from him, and not even sure that he had\r\nsaid those words, for he seemed to have shown them to her in some\r\nextraordinary manner through his smile, instead of uttering them,\r\nFlorence faintly said that she was obliged to him, but she would not\r\nwrite; she had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to send, Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my\xe2\x80\x94but my dear love\xe2\x80\x94if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDisturbed as Florence was, she raised her eyes to his face with an\r\nimploring and expressive look, that plainly besought him, if he\r\nknew\xe2\x80\x94which he as plainly did\xe2\x80\x94that any message between her and her\r\nfather was an uncommon charge, but that one most of all, to spare her.\r\nMr Carker smiled and bowed low, and being charged by Sir Barnet with\r\nthe best compliments of himself and Lady Skettles, took his leave, and\r\nrode away: leaving a favourable impression on that worthy couple.\r\nFlorence was seized with such a shudder as he went, that Sir Barnet,\r\nadopting the popular superstition, supposed somebody was passing over\r\nher grave. Mr Carker turning a corner, on the instant, looked back, and\r\nbowed, and disappeared, as if he rode off to the churchyard straight,\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nStrange News of Uncle Sol\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, though no sluggard, did not turn out so early on the\r\nmorning after he had seen Sol Gills, through the shop-window, writing\r\nin the parlour, with the Midshipman upon the counter, and Rob the\r\nGrinder making up his bed below it, but that the clocks struck six as\r\nhe raised himself on his elbow, and took a survey of his little\r\nchamber. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s eyes must have done severe duty, if he usually\r\nopened them as wide on awaking as he did that morning; and were but\r\nroughly rewarded for their vigilance, if he generally rubbed them half\r\nas hard. But the occasion was no common one, for Rob the Grinder had\r\ncertainly never stood in the doorway of Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s room before,\r\nand in it he stood then, panting at the Captain, with a flushed and\r\ntouzled air of Bed about him, that greatly heightened both his colour\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloa!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Rob could stammer a word in answer, Captain Cuttle turned out,\r\nall in a heap, and covered the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ye speak a word to me as\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, looking at his visitor in great consternation, gently\r\nshouldered him into the next room, after laying this injunction upon\r\nhim; and disappearing for a few moments, forthwith returned in the blue\r\nsuit. Holding up his hand in token of the injunction not yet being\r\ntaken off, Captain Cuttle walked up to the cupboard, and poured himself\r\nout a dram; a counterpart of which he handed to the messenger. The\r\nCaptain then stood himself up in a corner, against the wall, as if to\r\nforestall the possibility of being knocked backwards by the\r\ncommunication that was to be made to him; and having swallowed his\r\nliquor, with his eyes fixed on the messenger, and his face as pale as\r\nhis face could be, requested him to \xe2\x80\x9cheave ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean, tell you, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, who had been greatly\r\nimpressed by these precautions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t got much to tell. But look here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob produced a bundle of keys. The Captain surveyed them, remained in\r\nhis corner, and surveyed the messenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd look here!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Rob.\r\n\r\nThe boy produced a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle stared at as he\r\nhad stared at the keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I woke this morning, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich was about a\r\nquarter after five, I found these on my pillow. The shop-door was\r\nunbolted and unlocked, and Mr Gills gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlowed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so tremendous, and he came out of his corner\r\nwith such way on him, that Rob retreated before him into another\r\ncorner: holding out the keys and packet, to prevent himself from being\r\nrun down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x99 Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cis on the keys, and on the\r\npacket too. Upon my word and honour, Captain Cuttle, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything more about it. I wish I may die if I do! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sitiwation\r\nfor a lad that\xe2\x80\x99s just got a sitiwation,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the unfortunate Grinder,\r\nscrewing his cuff into his face: \xe2\x80\x9chis master bolted with his place, and\r\nhim blamed for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese lamentations had reference to Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, or rather\r\nglare, which was full of vague suspicions, threatenings, and\r\ndenunciations. Taking the proffered packet from his hand, the Captain\r\nopened it and read as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear Ned Cuttle. Enclosed is my will!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain turned it\r\nover, with a doubtful look\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c"and Testament\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Where\xe2\x80\x99s the Testament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain, instantly impeaching the ill-fated Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave you done with that, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never see it,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t keep on suspecting an innocent\r\nlad, Captain. I never touched the Testament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle shook his head, implying that somebody must be made\r\nanswerable for it; and gravely proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Which don\xe2\x80\x99t break open for a year, or until you have decisive\r\nintelligence of my dear Walter, who is dear to you, Ned, too, I am\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain paused and shook his head in some emotion; then, as\r\na re-establishment of his dignity in this trying position, looked with\r\nexceeding sternness at the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If you should never hear of me,\r\nor see me more, Ned, remember an old friend as he will remember you to\r\nthe last\xe2\x80\x94kindly; and at least until the period I have mentioned has\r\nexpired, keep a home in the old place for Walter. There are no debts,\r\nthe loan from Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House is paid off and all my keys I send with\r\nthis. Keep this quiet, and make no inquiry for me; it is useless. So no\r\nmore, dear Ned, from your true friend, Solomon Gills.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain\r\ntook a long breath, and then read these words written below: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The boy\r\nRob, well recommended, as I told you, from Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House. If all else\r\nshould come to the hammer, take care, Ned, of the little Midshipman.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo convey to posterity any idea of the manner in which the Captain,\r\nafter turning this letter over and over, and reading it a score of\r\ntimes, sat down in his chair, and held a court-martial on the subject\r\nin his own mind, would require the united genius of all the great men,\r\nwho, discarding their own untoward days, have determined to go down to\r\nposterity, and have never got there. At first the Captain was too much\r\nconfounded and distressed to think of anything but the letter itself;\r\nand even when his thoughts began to glance upon the various attendant\r\nfacts, they might, perhaps, as well have occupied themselves with their\r\nformer theme, for any light they reflected on them. In this state of\r\nmind, Captain Cuttle having the Grinder before the court, and no one\r\nelse, found it a great relief to decide, generally, that he was an\r\nobject of suspicion: which the Captain so clearly expressed in his\r\nvisage, that Rob remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how you can! what\r\nhave I done to be looked at, like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you sing out afore you\xe2\x80\x99re hurt.\r\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you commit yourself, whatever you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been and committed nothing, Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her free, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, impressively, \xe2\x80\x9cand ride easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a deep sense of the responsibility imposed upon him, and the\r\nnecessity of thoroughly fathoming this mysterious affair as became a\r\nman in his relations with the parties, Captain Cuttle resolved to go\r\ndown and examine the premises, and to keep the Grinder with him.\r\nConsidering that youth as under arrest at present, the Captain was in\r\nsome doubt whether it might not be expedient to handcuff him, or tie\r\nhis ankles together, or attach a weight to his legs; but not being\r\nclear as to the legality of such formalities, the Captain decided\r\nmerely to hold him by the shoulder all the way, and knock him down if\r\nhe made any objection.\r\n\r\nHowever, he made none, and consequently got to the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse without being placed under any more stringent restraint. As the\r\nshutters were not yet taken down, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s first care was to have\r\nthe shop opened; and when the daylight was freely admitted, he\r\nproceeded, with its aid, to further investigation.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s first care was to establish himself in a chair in the\r\nshop, as President of the solemn tribunal that was sitting within him;\r\nand to require Rob to lie down in his bed under the counter, show\r\nexactly where he discovered the keys and packet when he awoke, how he\r\nfound the door when he went to try it, how he started off to Brig\r\nPlace\xe2\x80\x94cautiously preventing the latter imitation from being carried\r\nfarther than the threshold\xe2\x80\x94and so on to the end of the chapter. When\r\nall this had been done several times, the Captain shook his head and\r\nseemed to think the matter had a bad look.\r\n\r\nNext, the Captain, with some indistinct idea of finding a body,\r\ninstituted a strict search over the whole house; groping in the cellars\r\nwith a lighted candle, thrusting his hook behind doors, bringing his\r\nhead into violent contact with beams, and covering himself with\r\ncobwebs. Mounting up to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room, they found that he had\r\nnot been in bed on the previous night, but had merely lain down on the\r\ncoverlet, as was evident from the impression yet remaining there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, looking round the room, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when Mr\r\nGills was going in and out so often, these last few days, he was taking\r\nlittle things away, piecemeal, not to attract attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy so, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, looking about, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see his shaving tackle.\r\nNor his brushes, Captain. Nor no shirts. Nor yet his shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs each of these articles was mentioned, Captain Cuttle took particular\r\nnotice of the corresponding department of the Grinder, lest he should\r\nappear to have been in recent use, or should prove to be in present\r\npossession thereof. But Rob had no occasion to shave, was not brushed,\r\nand wore the clothes he had on for a long time past, beyond all\r\npossibility of a mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what should you say,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot committing\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94about his time of sheering off? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he must have gone pretty\r\nsoon after I began to snore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, prepared to be very\r\nparticular about the exact time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell, Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cI only know that I\xe2\x80\x99m a heavy\r\nsleeper at first, and a light one towards morning; and if Mr Gills had\r\ncome through the shop near daybreak, though ever so much on tiptoe, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn mature consideration of this evidence, Captain Cuttle began to think\r\nthat the Instrument-maker must have vanished of his own accord; to\r\nwhich logical conclusion he was assisted by the letter addressed to\r\nhimself, which, as being undeniably in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, would\r\nseem, with no great forcing, to bear the construction, that he arranged\r\nof his own will to go, and so went. The Captain had next to consider\r\nwhere and why? and as there was no way whatsoever that he saw to the\r\nsolution of the first difficulty, he confined his meditations to the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nRemembering the old man\xe2\x80\x99s curious manner, and the farewell he had taken\r\nof him; unaccountably fervent at the time, but quite intelligible now:\r\na terrible apprehension strengthened on the Captain, that, overpowered\r\nby his anxieties and regrets for Walter, he had been driven to commit\r\nsuicide. Unequal to the wear and tear of daily life, as he had often\r\nprofessed himself to be, and shaken as he no doubt was by the\r\nuncertainty and deferred hope he had undergone, it seemed no violently\r\nstrained misgiving, but only too probable.\r\n\r\nFree from debt, and with no fear for his personal liberty, or the\r\nseizure of his goods, what else but such a state of madness could have\r\nhurried him away alone and secretly? As to his carrying some apparel\r\nwith him, if he had really done so\xe2\x80\x94and they were not even sure of\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94he might have done so, the Captain argued, to prevent inquiry, to\r\ndistract attention from his probable fate, or to ease the very mind\r\nthat was now revolving all these possibilities. Such, reduced into\r\nplain language, and condensed within a small compass, was the final\r\nresult and substance of Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations: which took a\r\nlong time to arrive at this pass, and were, like some more public\r\ndeliberations, very discursive and disorderly.\r\n\r\nDejected and despondent in the extreme, Captain Cuttle felt it just to\r\nrelease Rob from the arrest in which he had placed him, and to enlarge\r\nhim, subject to a kind of honourable inspection which he still resolved\r\nto exercise; and having hired a man, from Brogley the Broker, to sit in\r\nthe shop during their absence, the Captain, taking Rob with him, issued\r\nforth upon a dismal quest after the mortal remains of Solomon Gills.\r\n\r\nNot a station-house, or bone-house, or work-house in the metropolis\r\nescaped a visitation from the hard glazed hat. Along the wharves, among\r\nthe shipping on the bank-side, up the river, down the river, here,\r\nthere, everywhere, it went gleaming where men were thickest, like the\r\nhero\xe2\x80\x99s helmet in an epic battle. For a whole week the Captain read of\r\nall the found and missing people in all the newspapers and handbills,\r\nand went forth on expeditions at all hours of the day to identify\r\nSolomon Gills, in poor little ship-boys who had fallen overboard, and\r\nin tall foreigners with dark beards who had taken poison\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto make\r\nsure,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Cuttle said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it wam\xe2\x80\x99t him.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a sure thing\r\nthat it never was, and that the good Captain had no other satisfaction.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle at last abandoned these attempts as hopeless, and set\r\nhimself to consider what was to be done next. After several new\r\nperusals of his poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s letter, he considered that the\r\nmaintenance of \xe2\x80\x9ca home in the old place for Walter\xe2\x80\x9d was the primary\r\nduty imposed upon him. Therefore, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s decision was, that he\r\nwould keep house on the premises of Solomon Gills himself, and would go\r\ninto the instrument-business, and see what came of it.\r\n\r\nBut as this step involved the relinquishment of his apartments at Mrs\r\nMacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s, and he knew that resolute woman would never hear of his\r\ndeserting them, the Captain took the desperate determination of running\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look ye here, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain to Rob, when he had\r\nmatured this notable scheme, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be found in this here\r\nroadstead till night\xe2\x80\x94not till arter midnight p\xe2\x80\x99rhaps. But you keep\r\nwatch till you hear me knock, and the moment you do, turn-to, and open\r\nthe door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be rated on these here books,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Captain\r\ncondescendingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t say but what you may get promotion, if\r\nyou and me should pull together with a will. But the moment you hear me\r\nknock to-morrow night, whatever time it is, turn-to and show yourself\r\nsmart with the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to do it, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Captain, coming back again to\r\nenforce this charge upon his mind, \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be, for anything I can\r\nsay, a chase; and I might be took while I was waiting, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow yourself smart with the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob again assured the Captain that he would be prompt and wakeful; and\r\nthe Captain having made this prudent arrangement, went home to Mrs\r\nMacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe sense the Captain had of its being the last time, and of the awful\r\npurpose hidden beneath his blue waistcoat, inspired him with such a\r\nmortal dread of Mrs MacStinger, that the sound of that lady\xe2\x80\x99s foot\r\ndownstairs at any time of the day, was sufficient to throw him into a\r\nfit of trembling. It fell out, too, that Mrs MacStinger was in a\r\ncharming temper\xe2\x80\x94mild and placid as a house\xe2\x80\x94lamb; and Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconscience suffered terrible twinges, when she came up to inquire if\r\nshe could cook him nothing for his dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice small kidney-pudding now, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said his landlady:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a roast fowl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a bit of weal stuffing\r\nand some egg sauce. Come, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle! Give yourself a little treat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain very humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re out of sorts, and want to be stimulated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nMacStinger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not have, for once in a way, a bottle of sherry wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99d be so good as take a\r\nglass or two, I think I would try that. Would you do me the favour,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, torn to pieces by his conscience, \xe2\x80\x9cto accept\r\na quarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent ahead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why so, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x94sharply, as the\r\nCaptain thought.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was frightened to dead \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with\r\nsubmission, \xe2\x80\x9cit would oblige me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep my money very well. It\r\npays itself out. I should take it kind if you\xe2\x80\x99d comply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unconscious MacStinger, rubbing her\r\nhands, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do as you please. It\xe2\x80\x99s not for me, with my family, to\r\nrefuse, no more than it is to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, taking down the tin canister\r\nin which he kept his cash, from the top shelf of the cupboard, \xe2\x80\x9cbe so\r\ngood as offer eighteen-pence a-piece to the little family all round? If\r\nyou could make it convenient, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to pass the word presently for\r\nthem children to come for\xe2\x80\x99ard, in a body, I should be glad to see \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese innocent MacStingers were so many daggers to the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreast, when they appeared in a swarm, and tore at him with the\r\nconfiding trustfulness he so little deserved. The eye of Alexander\r\nMacStinger, who had been his favourite, was insupportable to the\r\nCaptain; the voice of Juliana MacStinger, who was the picture of her\r\nmother, made a coward of him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle kept up appearances, nevertheless, tolerably well, and\r\nfor an hour or two was very hardly used and roughly handled by the\r\nyoung MacStingers: who in their childish frolics, did a little damage\r\nalso to the glazed hat, by sitting in it, two at a time, as in a nest,\r\nand drumming on the inside of the crown with their shoes. At length the\r\nCaptain sorrowfully dismissed them: taking leave of these cherubs with\r\nthe poignant remorse and grief of a man who was going to execution.\r\n\r\nIn the silence of night, the Captain packed up his heavier property in\r\na chest, which he locked, intending to leave it there, in all\r\nprobability for ever, but on the forlorn chance of one day finding a\r\nman sufficiently bold and desperate to come and ask for it. Of his\r\nlighter necessaries, the Captain made a bundle; and disposed his plate\r\nabout his person, ready for flight. At the hour of midnight, when Brig\r\nPlace was buried in slumber, and Mrs MacStinger was lulled in sweet\r\noblivion, with her infants around her, the guilty Captain, stealing\r\ndown on tiptoe, in the dark, opened the door, closed it softly after\r\nhim, and took to his heels.\r\n\r\nPursued by the image of Mrs MacStinger springing out of bed, and,\r\nregardless of costume, following and bringing him back; pursued also by\r\na consciousness of his enormous crime; Captain Cuttle held on at a\r\ngreat pace, and allowed no grass to grow under his feet, between Brig\r\nPlace and the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s door. It opened when he knocked\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nRob was on the watch\xe2\x80\x94and when it was bolted and locked behind him,\r\nCaptain Cuttle felt comparatively safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, looking round him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a breather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing the matter, is there, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gaping Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, after changing colour, and listening to\r\na passing footstep in the street. \xe2\x80\x9cBut mind ye, my lad; if any lady,\r\nexcept either of them two as you see t\xe2\x80\x99other day, ever comes and asks\r\nfor Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, be sure to report no person of that name known, nor\r\nnever heard of here; observe them orders, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might say\xe2\x80\x94if you liked,\xe2\x80\x9d hesitated the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99d read\r\nin the paper that a Cap\xe2\x80\x99en of that name was gone to Australia,\r\nemigrating, along with a whole ship\xe2\x80\x99s complement of people as had all\r\nswore never to come back no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob nodded his understanding of these instructions; and Captain Cuttle\r\npromising to make a man of him, if he obeyed orders, dismissed him,\r\nyawning, to his bed under the counter, and went aloft to the chamber of\r\nSolomon Gills.\r\n\r\nWhat the Captain suffered next day, whenever a bonnet passed, or how\r\noften he darted out of the shop to elude imaginary MacStingers, and\r\nsought safety in the attic, cannot be told. But to avoid the fatigues\r\nattendant on this means of self-preservation, the Captain curtained the\r\nglass door of communication between the shop and parlour, on the\r\ninside; fitted a key to it from the bunch that had been sent to him;\r\nand cut a small hole of espial in the wall. The advantage of this\r\nfortification is obvious. On a bonnet appearing, the Captain instantly\r\nslipped into his garrison, locked himself up, and took a secret\r\nobservation of the enemy. Finding it a false alarm, the Captain\r\ninstantly slipped out again. And the bonnets in the street were so very\r\nnumerous, and alarms were so inseparable from their appearance, that\r\nthe Captain was almost incessantly slipping in and out all day long.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle found time, however, in the midst of this fatiguing\r\nservice to inspect the stock; in connexion with which he had the\r\ngeneral idea (very laborious to Rob) that too much friction could not\r\nbe bestowed upon it, and that it could not be made too bright. He also\r\nticketed a few attractive-looking articles at a venture, at prices\r\nranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds, and exposed them in the\r\nwindow to the great astonishment of the public.\r\n\r\nAfter effecting these improvements, Captain Cuttle, surrounded by the\r\ninstruments, began to feel scientific: and looked up at the stars at\r\nnight, through the skylight, when he was smoking his pipe in the little\r\nback parlour before going to bed, as if he had established a kind of\r\nproperty in them. As a tradesman in the City, too, he began to have an\r\ninterest in the Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs, and in Public Companies;\r\nand felt bound to read the quotations of the Funds every day, though he\r\nwas unable to make out, on any principle of navigation, what the\r\nfigures meant, and could have very well dispensed with the fractions.\r\nFlorence, the Captain waited on, with his strange news of Uncle Sol,\r\nimmediately after taking possession of the Midshipman; but she was away\r\nfrom home. So the Captain sat himself down in his altered station of\r\nlife, with no company but Rob the Grinder; and losing count of time, as\r\nmen do when great changes come upon them, thought musingly of Walter,\r\nand of Solomon Gills, and even of Mrs MacStinger herself, as among the\r\nthings that had been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nShadows of the Past and Future\r\n\r\n\r\nYour most obedient, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir, a friend of my\r\nfriend Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s is a friend of mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am infinitely obliged, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cto Major\r\nBagstock, for his company and conversation. Major Bagstock has rendered\r\nme great service, Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager, hat in hand, just arrived at Leamington, and\r\njust introduced to the Major, showed the Major his whole double range\r\nof teeth, and trusted he might take the liberty of thanking him with\r\nall his heart for having effected so great an Improvement in Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s looks and spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no thanks due to\r\nme, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a give and take affair. A great creature like our friend\r\nDombey, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, lowering his voice, but not lowering it\r\nso much as to render it inaudible to that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot help\r\nimproving and exalting his friends. He strengthens and invigorates a\r\nman, Sir, does Dombey, in his moral nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker snapped at the expression. In his moral nature. Exactly. The\r\nvery words he had been on the point of suggesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when my friend Dombey, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Major, \xe2\x80\x9ctalks to you of\r\nMajor Bagstock, I must crave leave to set him and you right. He means\r\nplain Joe, Sir\xe2\x80\x94Joey B.\xe2\x80\x94Josh. Bagstock\xe2\x80\x94Joseph\xe2\x80\x94rough and tough Old J.,\r\nSir. At your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s excessively friendly inclinations towards the Major, and Mr\r\nCarker\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of his roughness, toughness, and plainness, gleamed\r\nout of every tooth in Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and Dombey have the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\namount of business to talk over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, defiantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know better; a man of your\r\nmark\xe2\x80\x94the Colossus of commerce\xe2\x80\x94is not to be interrupted. Your moments\r\nare precious. We shall meet at dinner-time. In the interval, old Joseph\r\nwill be scarce. The dinner-hour is a sharp seven, Mr Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, the Major, greatly swollen as to his face, withdrew; but\r\nimmediately putting in his head at the door again, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. Dombey, have you any message to \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey in some embarrassment, and not without a glance at the\r\ncourteous keeper of his business confidence, entrusted the Major with\r\nhis compliments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must make it something warmer\r\nthan that, or old Joe will be far from welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegards then, if you will, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, shaking his shoulders and his great\r\ncheeks jocularly: \xe2\x80\x9cmake it something warmer than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you please, then, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend is sly, Sir, sly, Sir, de-vilish sly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\nstaring round the door at Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cSo is Bagstock.\xe2\x80\x9d But stopping in the\r\nmidst of a chuckle, and drawing himself up to his full height, the\r\nMajor solemnly exclaimed, as he struck himself on the chest, \xe2\x80\x9cDombey! I\r\nenvy your feelings. God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have found the gentleman a great resource,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker,\r\nfollowing him with his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery great indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has friends here, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive, from what\r\nhe has said, that you go into society here. Do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d smiling\r\nhorribly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so very glad that you go into society!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey acknowledged this display of interest on the part of his\r\nsecond in command, by twirling his watch-chain, and slightly moving his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were formed for society,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cOf all the men I know, you\r\nare the best adapted, by nature and by position, for society. Do you\r\nknow I have been frequently amazed that you should have held it at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had my reasons, Carker. I have been alone, and indifferent to\r\nit. But you have great social qualifications yourself, and are the more\r\nlikely to have been surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, with ready self-disparagement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nanother matter in the case of a man like me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t come into\r\ncomparison with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey put his hand to his neckcloth, settled his chin in it,\r\ncoughed, and stood looking at his faithful friend and servant for a few\r\nmoments in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the pleasure, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey at length: making\r\nas if he swallowed something a little too large for his throat: \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\npresent you to my\xe2\x80\x94to the Major\xe2\x80\x99s friends. Highly agreeable people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies among them, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d insinuated the smooth Manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, they are both\xe2\x80\x94ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two?\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are only two. I have confined my visits to their residence, and\r\nhave made no other acquaintance here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSisters, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother and daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Dombey dropped his eyes, and adjusted his neckcloth again, the\r\nsmiling face of Mr Carker the Manager became in a moment, and without\r\nany stage of transition, transformed into a most intent and frowning\r\nface, scanning his closely, and with an ugly sneer. As Mr Dombey raised\r\nhis eyes, it changed back, no less quickly, to its old expression, and\r\nshowed him every gum of which it stood possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be delighted to know them.\r\nSpeaking of daughters, I have seen Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden rush of blood to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the liberty of waiting on her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cto inquire if she\r\ncould charge me with any little commission. I am not so fortunate as to\r\nbe the bearer of any but her\xe2\x80\x94but her dear love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWolf\xe2\x80\x99s face that it was then, with even the hot tongue revealing itself\r\nthrough the stretched mouth, as the eyes encountered Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business intelligence is there?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the latter gentleman,\r\nafter a silence, during which Mr Carker had produced some memoranda and\r\nother papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is very little,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon the whole we have not\r\nhad our usual good fortune of late, but that is of little moment to\r\nyou. At Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, they give up the Son and Heir for lost. Well, she was\r\ninsured, from her keel to her masthead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, taking a chair near him, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say that\r\nyoung man, Gay, ever impressed me favourably\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94But I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, without heeding the interruption, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nhad never gone on board that ship. I wish he had never been sent out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so, in good time, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nCarker, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all for the best. I really,\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s all for the best. Did I mention that there was something\r\nlike a little confidence between Miss Dombey and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Carker, after an impressive pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nwherever Gay is, he is much better where he is, than at home here. If I\r\nwere, or could be, in your place, I should be satisfied of that. I am\r\nquite satisfied of it myself. Miss Dombey is confiding and\r\nyoung\xe2\x80\x94perhaps hardly proud enough, for your daughter\xe2\x80\x94if she have a\r\nfault. Not that that is much though, I am sure. Will you check these\r\nbalances with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey leaned back in his chair, instead of bending over the papers\r\nthat were laid before him, and looked the Manager steadily in the face.\r\nThe Manager, with his eyelids slightly raised, affected to be glancing\r\nat his figures, and to await the leisure of his principal. He showed\r\nthat he affected this, as if from great delicacy, and with a design to\r\nspare Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s feelings; and the latter, as he looked at him, was\r\ncognizant of his intended consideration, and felt that but for it, this\r\nconfidential Carker would have said a great deal more, which he, Mr\r\nDombey, was too proud to ask for. It was his way in business, often.\r\nLittle by little, Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s gaze relaxed, and his attention became\r\ndiverted to the papers before him; but while busy with the occupation\r\nthey afforded him, he frequently stopped, and looked at Mr Carker\r\nagain. Whenever he did so, Mr Carker was demonstrative, as before, in\r\nhis delicacy, and impressed it on his great chief more and more.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged; and under the skilful culture of the\r\nManager, angry thoughts in reference to poor Florence brooded and bred\r\nin Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s breast, usurping the place of the cold dislike that\r\ngenerally reigned there; Major Bagstock, much admired by the old ladies\r\nof Leamington, and followed by the Native, carrying the usual amount of\r\nlight baggage, straddled along the shady side of the way, to make a\r\nmorning call on Mrs Skewton. It being midday when the Major reached the\r\nbower of Cleopatra, he had the good fortune to find his Princess on her\r\nusual sofa, languishing over a cup of coffee, with the room so darkened\r\nand shaded for her more luxurious repose, that Withers, who was in\r\nattendance on her, loomed like a phantom page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat insupportable creature is this, coming in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot hear it. Go away, whoever you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not the heart to banish J. B., Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major halting\r\nmidway, to remonstrate, with his cane over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it? On second thoughts, you may enter,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nCleopatra.\r\n\r\nThe Major entered accordingly, and advancing to the sofa pressed her\r\ncharming hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, listlessly waving her fan, \xe2\x80\x9ca long way off.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t come too near me, for I am frightfully faint and sensitive this\r\nmorning, and you smell of the Sun. You are absolutely tropical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthe time has been when Joseph\r\nBagstock has been grilled and blistered by the Sun; then time was, when\r\nhe was forced, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, into such full blow, by high hothouse heat in the\r\nWest Indies, that he was known as the Flower. A man never heard of\r\nBagstock, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in those days; he heard of the Flower\xe2\x80\x94the Flower of\r\nOurs. The Flower may have faded, more or less, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nMajor, dropping into a much nearer chair than had been indicated by his\r\ncruel Divinity, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is a tough plant yet, and constant as the\r\nevergreen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Major, under cover of the dark room, shut up one eye, rolled\r\nhis head like a Harlequin, and, in his great self-satisfaction, perhaps\r\nwent nearer to the confines of apoplexy than he had ever gone before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs Granger?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Cleopatra of her page.\r\n\r\nWithers believed she was in her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, and shut the door. I am\r\nengaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Withers disappeared, Mrs Skewton turned her head languidly towards\r\nthe Major, without otherwise moving, and asked him how his friend was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, with a facetious gurgling in his\r\nthroat, \xe2\x80\x9cis as well as a man in his condition can be. His condition is\r\na desperate one, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He is touched, is Dombey! Touched!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nMajor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is bayonetted through the body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra cast a sharp look at the Major, that contrasted forcibly with\r\nthe affected drawl in which she presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Bagstock, although I know but little of the world,\xe2\x80\x94nor can I\r\nreally regret my experience, for I fear it is a false place, full of\r\nwithering conventionalities: where Nature is but little regarded, and\r\nwhere the music of the heart, and the gushing of the soul, and all that\r\nsort of thing, which is so truly poetical, is seldom heard,\xe2\x80\x94I cannot\r\nmisunderstand your meaning. There is an allusion to Edith\xe2\x80\x94to my\r\nextremely dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, tracing the outline of her\r\neyebrows with her forefinger, \xe2\x80\x9cin your words, to which the tenderest of\r\nchords vibrates excessively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBluntness, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, \xe2\x80\x9chas ever been the\r\ncharacteristic of the Bagstock breed. You are right. Joe admits it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that allusion,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cwould involve one of the\r\nmost\xe2\x80\x94if not positively the most\xe2\x80\x94touching, and thrilling, and sacred\r\nemotions of which our sadly-fallen nature is susceptible, I conceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major laid his hand upon his lips, and wafted a kiss to Cleopatra,\r\nas if to identify the emotion in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I am weak. I feel that I am wanting in that energy, which\r\nshould sustain a Mama: not to say a parent: on such a subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Skewton, trimming her lips with the laced edge of her\r\npocket-handkerchief; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can hardly approach a topic so excessively\r\nmomentous to my dearest Edith without a feeling of faintness.\r\nNevertheless, bad man, as you have boldly remarked upon it, and as it\r\nhas occasioned me great anguish:\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Skewton touched her left side\r\nwith her fan: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not shrink from my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major, under cover of the dimness, swelled, and swelled, and rolled\r\nhis purple face about, and winked his lobster eye, until he fell into a\r\nfit of wheezing, which obliged him to rise and take a turn or two about\r\nthe room, before his fair friend could proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, when she at length resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nobliging enough, now many weeks ago, to do us the honour of visiting us\r\nhere; in company, my dear Major, with yourself. I acknowledge\xe2\x80\x94let me be\r\nopen\xe2\x80\x94that it is my failing to be the creature of impulse, and to wear\r\nmy heart as it were, outside. I know my failing full well. My enemy\r\ncannot know it better. But I am not penitent; I would rather not be\r\nfrozen by the heartless world, and am content to bear this imputation\r\njustly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton arranged her tucker, pinched her wiry throat to give it a\r\nsoft surface, and went on, with great complacency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gave me (my dearest Edith too, I am sure) infinite pleasure to\r\nreceive Mr Dombey. As a friend of yours, my dear Major, we were\r\nnaturally disposed to be prepossessed in his favour; and I fancied that\r\nI observed an amount of Heart in Mr Dombey, that was excessively\r\nrefreshing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is devilish little heart in Dombey now, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretched man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, looking at him languidly, \xe2\x80\x9cpray be\r\nsilent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJ. B. is dumb, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Cleopatra, smoothing the rosy hue upon her cheeks,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9caccordingly repeated his visit; and possibly finding some attraction\r\nin the simplicity and primitiveness of our tastes\xe2\x80\x94for there is always a\r\ncharm in nature\xe2\x80\x94it is so very sweet\xe2\x80\x94became one of our little circle\r\nevery evening. Little did I think of the awful responsibility into\r\nwhich I plunged when I encouraged Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo beat up these quarters, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Major Bagstock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoarse person!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou anticipate my meaning, though\r\nin odious language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Skewton rested her elbow on the little table at her side, and\r\nsuffering her wrist to droop in what she considered a graceful and\r\nbecoming manner, dangled her fan to and fro, and lazily admired her\r\nhand while speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe agony I have endured,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mincingly, \xe2\x80\x9cas the truth has by\r\ndegrees dawned upon me, has been too exceedingly terrific to dilate\r\nupon. My whole existence is bound up in my sweetest Edith; and to see\r\nher change from day to day\xe2\x80\x94my beautiful pet, who has positively\r\ngarnered up her heart since the death of that most delightful creature,\r\nGranger\xe2\x80\x94is the most affecting thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s world was not a very trying one, if one might judge of it\r\nby the influence of its most affecting circumstance upon her; but this\r\nby the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\xe2\x80\x9d simpered Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is the perfect pearl of my life, is\r\nsaid to resemble me. I believe we are alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one man in the world who never will admit that anyone\r\nresembles you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major; \xe2\x80\x9cand that man\xe2\x80\x99s name is Old Joe\r\nBagstock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra made as if she would brain the flatterer with her fan, but\r\nrelenting, smiled upon him and proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my charming girl inherits any advantages from me, wicked one!\xe2\x80\x9d: the\r\nMajor was the wicked one: \xe2\x80\x9cshe inherits also my foolish nature. She has\r\ngreat force of character\xe2\x80\x94mine has been said to be immense, though I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x94but once moved, she is susceptible and sensitive to\r\nthe last extent. What are my feelings when I see her pining! They\r\ndestroy me.\r\n\r\nThe Major advancing his double chin, and pursing up his blue lips into\r\na soothing expression, affected the profoundest sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has subsisted between us\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfree development of soul, and openness of sentiment\xe2\x80\x94is touching to\r\nthink of. We have been more like sisters than Mama and child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJ. B.\xe2\x80\x9cs own sentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed by J. B. fifty\r\nthousand times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not interrupt, rude man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are my feelings,\r\nthen, when I find that there is one subject avoided by us! That there\r\nis a what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\xe2\x80\x94a gulf\xe2\x80\x94opened between us. That my own artless\r\nEdith is changed to me! They are of the most poignant description, of\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major left his chair, and took one nearer to the little table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom day to day I see this, my dear Major,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs Skewton.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom day to day I feel this. From hour to hour I reproach myself for\r\nthat excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing\r\nconsequences; and almost from minute to minute, I hope that Mr Dombey\r\nmay explain himself, and relieve the torture I undergo, which is\r\nextremely wearing. But nothing happens, my dear Major; I am the slave\r\nof remorse\xe2\x80\x94take care of the coffee-cup: you are so very awkward\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ndarling Edith is an altered being; and I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see what is to be\r\ndone, or what good creature I can advise with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Bagstock, encouraged perhaps by the softened and confidential\r\ntone into which Mrs Skewton, after several times lapsing into it for a\r\nmoment, seemed now to have subsided for good, stretched out his hand\r\nacross the little table, and said with a leer,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvise with Joe, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, you aggravating monster,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, giving one hand to the\r\nMajor, and tapping his knuckles with her fan, which she held in the\r\nother: \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk to me? you know what I mean. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntell me something to the purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major laughed, and kissed the hand she had bestowed upon him, and\r\nlaughed again immensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there as much Heart in Mr Dombey as I gave him credit for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlanguished Cleopatra tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he is in earnest, my dear\r\nMajor? Would you recommend his being spoken to, or his being left\r\nalone? Now tell me, like a dear man, what would you advise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we marry him to Edith Granger, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the Major,\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMysterious creature!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cleopatra, bringing her fan to bear\r\nupon the Major\xe2\x80\x99s nose. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we marry him to Edith Granger, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I say?\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the Major\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton returned no answer in words, but smiled upon the Major with\r\nso much archness and vivacity, that that gallant officer considering\r\nhimself challenged, would have imprinted a kiss on her exceedingly red\r\nlips, but for her interposing the fan with a very winning and juvenile\r\ndexterity. It might have been in modesty; it might have been in\r\napprehension of some danger to their bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cis a great catch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mercenary wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cleopatra, with a little shriek, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nshocked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Dombey, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Major, thrusting forward his head, and\r\ndistending his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cis in earnest. Joseph says it; Bagstock knows it;\r\nJ. B. keeps him to the mark. Leave Dombey to himself, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Dombey is\r\nsafe, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Do as you have done; do no more; and trust to J. B. for\r\nthe end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really think so, my dear Major?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cleopatra, who had eyed\r\nhim very cautiously, and very searchingly, in spite of her listless\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure of it, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cCleopatra the peerless, and\r\nher Antony Bagstock, will often speak of this, triumphantly, when\r\nsharing the elegance and wealth of Edith Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s establishment.\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, stopping abruptly in a\r\nchuckle, and becoming serious, \xe2\x80\x9chas arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety for\r\nhis arrival, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, is to be referred\xe2\x80\x94take J. B.\xe2\x80\x9cs word for this; for\r\nJoe is devilish sly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Major tapped his nose, and screwed up one of\r\nhis eyes tight: which did not enhance his native beauty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto his desire\r\nthat what is in the wind should become known to him\xe2\x80\x9d without Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntelling and consulting him. For Dombey is as proud, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nMajor, \xe2\x80\x9cas Lucifer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming quality,\xe2\x80\x9d lisped Mrs Skewton; \xe2\x80\x9creminding one of dearest\r\nEdith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cI have thrown out hints already, and\r\nthe right-hand man understands \xe2\x80\x99em; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw out more, before the\r\nday is done. Dombey projected this morning a ride to Warwick Castle,\r\nand to Kenilworth, to-morrow, to be preceded by a breakfast with us. I\r\nundertook the delivery of this invitation. Will you honour us so far,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, swelling with shortness of breath and slyness,\r\nas he produced a note, addressed to the Honourable Mrs Skewton, by\r\nfavour of Major Bagstock, wherein hers ever faithfully, Paul Dombey,\r\nbesought her and her amiable and accomplished daughter to consent to\r\nthe proposed excursion; and in a postscript unto which, the same ever\r\nfaithfully Paul Dombey entreated to be recalled to the remembrance of\r\nMrs Granger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cEdith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loving mother can scarcely be described as resuming her insipid and\r\naffected air when she made this exclamation; for she had never cast it\r\noff; nor was it likely that she ever would or could, in any other place\r\nthan in the grave. But hurriedly dismissing whatever shadow of\r\nearnestness, or faint confession of a purpose, laudable or wicked, that\r\nher face, or voice, or manner: had, for the moment, betrayed, she\r\nlounged upon the couch, her most insipid and most languid self again,\r\nas Edith entered the room.\r\n\r\nEdith, so beautiful and stately, but so cold and so repelling. Who,\r\nslightly acknowledging the presence of Major Bagstock, and directing a\r\nkeen glance at her mother, drew back from a window, and sat down there,\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere on earth have you been? I\r\nhave wanted you, my love, most sadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you were engaged, and I stayed away,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, without\r\nturning her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was cruel to Old Joe, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major in his gallantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very cruel, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still looking out\xe2\x80\x94and said with\r\nsuch calm disdain, that the Major was discomfited, and could think of\r\nnothing in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Bagstock, my darling Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is\r\ngenerally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world: as\r\nyou know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely not worthwhile, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nobserve these forms of speech. We are quite alone. We know each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe quiet scorn that sat upon her handsome face\xe2\x80\x94a scorn that evidently\r\nlighted on herself, no less than them\xe2\x80\x94was so intense and deep, that her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s simper, for the instant, though of a hardy constitution,\r\ndrooped before it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot woman yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very odd you are today, my dear! Pray let me say, my love, that\r\nMajor Bagstock has brought the kindest of notes from Mr Dombey,\r\nproposing that we should breakfast with him to-morrow, and ride to\r\nWarwick and Kenilworth. Will you go, Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill I go!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, turning very red, and breathing quickly as\r\nshe looked round at her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would, my own, observed the latter carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is, as\r\nyou say, quite a form to ask. Here is Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s letter, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. I have no desire to read it,\xe2\x80\x9d was her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps I had better answer it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nI had thought of asking you to be my secretary, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d As Edith made\r\nno movement, and no answer, Mrs Skewton begged the Major to wheel her\r\nlittle table nearer, and to set open the desk it contained, and to take\r\nout pen and paper for her; all which congenial offices of gallantry the\r\nMajor discharged, with much submission and devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour regards, Edith, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, pausing, pen in hand,\r\nat the postscript.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you will, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, without turning her head, and with\r\nsupreme indifference.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton wrote what she would, without seeking for any more explicit\r\ndirections, and handed her letter to the Major, who receiving it as a\r\nprecious charge, made a show of laying it near his heart, but was fain\r\nto put it in the pocket of his pantaloons on account of the insecurity\r\nof his waistcoat. The Major then took a very polished and chivalrous\r\nfarewell of both ladies, which the elder one acknowledged in her usual\r\nmanner, while the younger, sitting with her face addressed to the\r\nwindow, bent her head so slightly that it would have been a greater\r\ncompliment to the Major to have made no sign at all, and to have left\r\nhim to infer that he had not been heard or thought of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to alteration in her, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d mused the Major on his way back; on\r\nwhich expedition\xe2\x80\x94the afternoon being sunny and hot\xe2\x80\x94he ordered the\r\nNative and the light baggage to the front, and walked in the shadow of\r\nthat expatriated prince: \xe2\x80\x9cas to alteration, Sir, and pining, and so\r\nforth, that won\xe2\x80\x99t go down with Joseph Bagstock, None of that, Sir. It\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do here. But as to there being something of a division between\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94or a gulf as the mother calls it\xe2\x80\x94damme, Sir, that seems true\r\nenough. And it\xe2\x80\x99s odd enough! Well, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d panted the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cEdith\r\nGranger and Dombey are well matched; let \xe2\x80\x99em fight it out! Bagstock\r\nbacks the winner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major, by saying these latter words aloud, in the vigour of his\r\nthoughts, caused the unhappy Native to stop, and turn round, in the\r\nbelief that he was personally addressed. Exasperated to the last degree\r\nby this act of insubordination, the Major (though he was swelling with\r\nenjoyment of his own humour), at the moment of its occurrence instantly\r\nthrust his cane among the Native\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, and continued to stir him up,\r\nat short intervals, all the way to the hotel.\r\n\r\nNor was the Major less exasperated as he dressed for dinner, during\r\nwhich operation the dark servant underwent the pelting of a shower of\r\nmiscellaneous objects, varying in size from a boot to a hairbrush, and\r\nincluding everything that came within his master\xe2\x80\x99s reach. For the Major\r\nplumed himself on having the Native in a perfect state of drill, and\r\nvisited the least departure from strict discipline with this kind of\r\nfatigue duty. Add to this, that he maintained the Native about his\r\nperson as a counter-irritant against the gout, and all other vexations,\r\nmental as well as bodily; and the Native would appear to have earned\r\nhis pay\xe2\x80\x94which was not large.\r\n\r\nAt length, the Major having disposed of all the missiles that were\r\nconvenient to his hand, and having called the Native so many new names\r\nas must have given him great occasion to marvel at the resources of the\r\nEnglish language, submitted to have his cravat put on; and being\r\ndressed, and finding himself in a brisk flow of spirits after this\r\nexercise, went downstairs to enliven \xe2\x80\x9cDombey\xe2\x80\x9d and his right-hand man.\r\n\r\nDombey was not yet in the room, but the right-hand man was there, and\r\nhis dental treasures were, as usual, ready for the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cHow have you passed the time since I had\r\nthe happiness of meeting you? Have you walked at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA saunter of barely half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s duration,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave been so much occupied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA variety of little matters necessary to be gone through,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nCarker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know\xe2\x80\x94this is quite unusual with me, educated in a\r\ndistrustful school, and who am not generally disposed to be\r\ncommunicative,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, breaking off, and speaking in a charming tone\r\nof frankness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I feel quite confidential with you, Major Bagstock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do me honour, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, then,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have not found my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94our friend, I ought rather to call him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning Dombey, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see me, Mr Carker,\r\nstanding here! J. B.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was puffy enough to see, and blue enough; and Mr Carker intimated\r\nthe he had that pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you see a man, Sir, who would go through fire and water to serve\r\nDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Major Bagstock.\r\n\r\nMr Carker smiled, and said he was sure of it. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nproceeded: \xe2\x80\x9cto resume where I left off: that I have not found our\r\nfriend so attentive to business today, as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the delighted Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found him a little abstracted, and with his attention disposed\r\nto wander,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a lady in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I begin to believe there really is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you might be jesting when you seemed to hint at it; for I know\r\nyou military men\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe Major gave the horse\xe2\x80\x99s cough, and shook his head and shoulders, as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! we are gay dogs, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying.\xe2\x80\x9d He then\r\nseized Mr Carker by the button-hole, and with starting eyes whispered\r\nin his ear, that she was a woman of extraordinary charms, Sir. That she\r\nwas a young widow, Sir. That she was of a fine family, Sir. That Dombey\r\nwas over head and ears in love with her, Sir, and that it would be a\r\ngood match on both sides; for she had beauty, blood, and talent, and\r\nDombey had fortune; and what more could any couple have? Hearing Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps without, the Major cut himself short by saying, that\r\nMr Carker would see her tomorrow morning, and would judge for himself;\r\nand between his mental excitement, and the exertion of saying all this\r\nin wheezy whispers, the Major sat gurgling in the throat and watering\r\nat the eyes, until dinner was ready.\r\n\r\nThe Major, like some other noble animals, exhibited himself to great\r\nadvantage at feeding-time. On this occasion, he shone resplendent at\r\none end of the table, supported by the milder lustre of Mr Dombey at\r\nthe other; while Carker on one side lent his ray to either light, or\r\nsuffered it to merge into both, as occasion arose.\r\n\r\nDuring the first course or two, the Major was usually grave; for the\r\nNative, in obedience to general orders, secretly issued, collected\r\nevery sauce and cruet round him, and gave him a great deal to do, in\r\ntaking out the stoppers, and mixing up the contents in his plate.\r\nBesides which, the Native had private zests and flavours on a\r\nside-table, with which the Major daily scorched himself; to say nothing\r\nof strange machines out of which he spirited unknown liquids into the\r\nMajor\xe2\x80\x99s drink. But on this occasion, Major Bagstock, even amidst these\r\nmany occupations, found time to be social; and his sociality consisted\r\nin excessive slyness for the behoof of Mr Carker, and the betrayal of\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t eat; what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI am doing very well; I have no\r\ngreat appetite today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dombey, what\xe2\x80\x99s become of it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s it gone?\r\nYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t left it with our friends, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear, for I can answer for\r\ntheir having none today at luncheon. I can answer for one of \xe2\x80\x99em, at\r\nleast: I won\xe2\x80\x99t say which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the Major winked at Carker, and became so frightfully sly, that\r\nhis dark attendant was obliged to pat him on the back, without orders,\r\nor he would probably have disappeared under the table.\r\n\r\nIn a later stage of the dinner: that is to say, when the Native stood\r\nat the Major\xe2\x80\x99s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne: the\r\nMajor became still slyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill this to the brim, you scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, holding up his\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x9cFill Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s to the brim too. And Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s too. By Gad,\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, winking at his new friend, while Mr Dombey\r\nlooked into his plate with a conscious air, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll consecrate this\r\nglass of wine to a Divinity whom Joe is proud to know, and at a\r\ndistance humbly and reverently to admire. Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nher name; angelic Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo angelic Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the smiling Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the waiters with new dishes caused the Major to be\r\nslyer yet, but in a more serious vein. \xe2\x80\x9cFor though among ourselves, Joe\r\nBagstock mingles jest and earnest on this subject, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nMajor, laying his finger on his lips, and speaking half apart to\r\nCarker, \xe2\x80\x9che holds that name too sacred to be made the property of these\r\nfellows, or of any fellows. Not a word, Sir, while they are here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was respectful and becoming on the Major\xe2\x80\x99s part, and Mr Dombey\r\nplainly felt it so. Although embarrassed in his own frigid way, by the\r\nMajor\xe2\x80\x99s allusions, Mr Dombey had no objection to such rallying, it was\r\nclear, but rather courted it. Perhaps the Major had been pretty near\r\nthe truth, when he had divined that morning that the great man who was\r\ntoo haughty formally to consult with, or confide in his prime minister,\r\non such a matter, yet wished him to be fully possessed of it. Let this\r\nbe how it may, he often glanced at Mr Carker while the Major plied his\r\nlight artillery, and seemed watchful of its effect upon him.\r\n\r\nBut the Major, having secured an attentive listener, and a smiler who\r\nhad not his match in all the world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin short, a devilish intelligent\r\nand able fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d as he often afterwards declared\xe2\x80\x94was not going to let\r\nhim off with a little slyness personal to Mr Dombey. Therefore, on the\r\nremoval of the cloth, the Major developed himself as a choice spirit in\r\nthe broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental\r\nstories, and cracking regimental jokes, which he did with such prodigal\r\nexuberance, that Carker was (or feigned to be) quite exhausted with\r\nlaughter and admiration: while Mr Dombey looked on over his starched\r\ncravat, like the Major\xe2\x80\x99s proprietor, or like a stately showman who was\r\nglad to see his bear dancing well.\r\n\r\nWhen the Major was too hoarse with meat and drink, and the display of\r\nhis social powers, to render himself intelligible any longer, they\r\nadjourned to coffee. After which, the Major inquired of Mr Carker the\r\nManager, with little apparent hope of an answer in the affirmative, if\r\nhe played picquet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I play picquet a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBackgammon, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Major, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I play backgammon a little too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man of teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker plays at all games, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, laying himself\r\non a sofa like a man of wood, without a hinge or a joint in him; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nplays them well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn sooth, he played the two in question, to such perfection, that the\r\nMajor was astonished, and asked him, at random, if he played chess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I play chess a little,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cI have sometimes\r\nplayed, and won a game\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere trick\xe2\x80\x94without seeing the board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, staring, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a contrast to Dombey,\r\nwho plays nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! He!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never had occasion to acquire\r\nsuch little arts. To men like me, they are sometimes useful. As at\r\npresent, Major Bagstock, when they enable me to take a hand with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be only the false mouth, so smooth and wide; and yet there\r\nseemed to lurk beneath the humility and subserviency of this short\r\nspeech, a something like a snarl; and, for a moment, one might have\r\nthought that the white teeth were prone to bite the hand they fawned\r\nupon. But the Major thought nothing about it; and Mr Dombey lay\r\nmeditating with his eyes half shut, during the whole of the play, which\r\nlasted until bed-time.\r\n\r\nBy that time, Mr Carker, though the winner, had mounted high into the\r\nMajor\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion, insomuch that when he left the Major at his own\r\nroom before going to bed, the Major as a special attention, sent the\r\nNative\xe2\x80\x94who always rested on a mattress spread upon the ground at his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s door\xe2\x80\x94along the gallery, to light him to his room in state.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint blur on the surface of the mirror in Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, and its reflection was, perhaps, a false one. But it showed,\r\nthat night, the image of a man, who saw, in his fancy, a crowd of\r\npeople slumbering on the ground at his feet, like the poor Native at\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s door: who picked his way among them: looking down,\r\nmaliciously enough: but trod upon no upturned face\xe2\x80\x94as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nDeeper Shadows\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Carker the Manager rose with the lark, and went out, walking in the\r\nsummer day. His meditations\xe2\x80\x94and he meditated with contracted brows\r\nwhile he strolled along\xe2\x80\x94hardly seemed to soar as high as the lark, or\r\nto mount in that direction; rather they kept close to their nest upon\r\nthe earth, and looked about, among the dust and worms. But there was\r\nnot a bird in the air, singing unseen, farther beyond the reach of\r\nhuman eye than Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. He had his face so perfectly under\r\ncontrol, that few could say more, in distinct terms, of its expression,\r\nthan that it smiled or that it pondered. It pondered now, intently. As\r\nthe lark rose higher, he sank deeper in thought. As the lark poured out\r\nher melody clearer and stronger, he fell into a graver and profounder\r\nsilence. At length, when the lark came headlong down, with an\r\naccumulating stream of song, and dropped among the green wheat near\r\nhim, rippling in the breath of the morning like a river, he sprang up\r\nfrom his reverie, and looked round with a sudden smile, as courteous\r\nand as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate; nor did\r\nhe relapse, after being thus awakened; but clearing his face, like one\r\nwho bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales,\r\nwent smiling on, as if for practice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps with an eye to first impressions, Mr Carker was very carefully\r\nand trimly dressed, that morning. Though always somewhat formal, in his\r\ndress, in imitation of the great man whom he served, he stopped short\r\nof the extent of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s stiffness: at once perhaps because he knew\r\nit to be ludicrous, and because in doing so he found another means of\r\nexpressing his sense of the difference and distance between them. Some\r\npeople quoted him indeed, in this respect, as a pointed commentary, and\r\nnot a flattering one, on his icy patron\xe2\x80\x94but the world is prone to\r\nmisconstruction, and Mr Carker was not accountable for its bad\r\npropensity.\r\n\r\nClean and florid: with his light complexion, fading as it were, in the\r\nsun, and his dainty step enhancing the softness of the turf: Mr Carker\r\nthe Manager strolled about meadows, and green lanes, and glided among\r\navenues of trees, until it was time to return to breakfast. Taking a\r\nnearer way back, Mr Carker pursued it, airing his teeth, and said aloud\r\nas he did so, \xe2\x80\x9cNow to see the second Mrs Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had strolled beyond the town, and re-entered it by a pleasant walk,\r\nwhere there was a deep shade of leafy trees, and where there were a few\r\nbenches here and there for those who chose to rest. It not being a\r\nplace of general resort at any hour, and wearing at that time of the\r\nstill morning the air of being quite deserted and retired, Mr Carker\r\nhad it, or thought he had it, all to himself. So, with the whim of an\r\nidle man, to whom there yet remained twenty minutes for reaching a\r\ndestination easily able in ten, Mr Carker threaded the great boles of\r\nthe trees, and went passing in and out, before this one and behind\r\nthat, weaving a chain of footsteps on the dewy ground.\r\n\r\nBut he found he was mistaken in supposing there was no one in the\r\ngrove, for as he softly rounded the trunk of one large tree, on which\r\nthe obdurate bark was knotted and overlapped like the hide of a\r\nrhinoceros or some kindred monster of the ancient days before the\r\nFlood, he saw an unexpected figure sitting on a bench near at hand,\r\nabout which, in another moment, he would have wound the chain he was\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nIt was that of a lady, elegantly dressed and very handsome, whose dark\r\nproud eyes were fixed upon the ground, and in whom some passion or\r\nstruggle was raging. For as she sat looking down, she held a corner of\r\nher under lip within her mouth, her bosom heaved, her nostril quivered,\r\nher head trembled, indignant tears were on her cheek, and her foot was\r\nset upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing. And\r\nyet almost the self-same glance that showed him this, showed him the\r\nself-same lady rising with a scornful air of weariness and lassitude,\r\nand turning away with nothing expressed in face or figure but careless\r\nbeauty and imperious disdain.\r\n\r\nA withered and very ugly old woman, dressed not so much like a gipsy as\r\nlike any of that medley race of vagabonds who tramp about the country,\r\nbegging, and stealing, and tinkering, and weaving rushes, by turns, or\r\nall together, had been observing the lady, too; for, as she rose, this\r\nsecond figure strangely confronting the first, scrambled up from the\r\nground\xe2\x80\x94out of it, it almost appeared\xe2\x80\x94and stood in the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell your fortune, my pretty lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman,\r\nmunching with her jaws, as if the Death\xe2\x80\x99s Head beneath her yellow skin\r\nwere impatient to get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell it for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, pretty lady; but not right. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it right when you\r\nwere sitting there. I see you! Give me a piece of silver, pretty lady,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your fortune true. There\xe2\x80\x99s riches, pretty lady, in your\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady, passing her with a dark smile, and a proud\r\nstep. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You won\xe2\x80\x99t give me nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nme nothing to tell your fortune, pretty lady? How much will you give me\r\nto tell it, then? Give me something, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll call it after you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncroaked the old woman, passionately.\r\n\r\nMr Carker, whom the lady was about to pass close, slinking against his\r\ntree as she crossed to gain the path, advanced so as to meet her, and\r\npulling off his hat as she went by, bade the old woman hold her peace.\r\nThe lady acknowledged his interference with an inclination of the head,\r\nand went her way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give me something then, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll call it after her!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the\r\nold woman, throwing up her arms, and pressing forward against his\r\noutstretched hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOr come,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, dropping her voice suddenly,\r\nlooking at him earnestly, and seeming in a moment to forget the object\r\nof her wrath, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me something, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll call it after you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter me, old lady!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Manager, putting his hand in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, steadfast in her scrutiny, and holding out her\r\nshrivelled hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Carker, throwing her a shilling. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow who the handsome lady is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMunching like that sailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife of yore, who had chestnuts in her lap,\r\nand scowling like the witch who asked for some in vain, the old woman\r\npicked the shilling up, and going backwards, like a crab, or like a\r\nheap of crabs: for her alternately expanding and contracting hands\r\nmight have represented two of that species, and her creeping face, some\r\nhalf-a-dozen more: crouched on the veinous root of an old tree, pulled\r\nout a short black pipe from within the crown of her bonnet, lighted it\r\nwith a match, and smoked in silence, looking fixedly at her questioner.\r\n\r\nMr Carker laughed, and turned upon his heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cOne child dead, and one child living: one\r\nwife dead, and one wife coming. Go and meet her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, the Manager looked round again, and stopped. The\r\nold woman, who had not removed her pipe, and was munching and mumbling\r\nwhile she smoked, as if in conversation with an invisible familiar,\r\npointed with her finger in the direction he was going, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that you said, Bedlamite?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe woman mumbled, and chattered, and smoked, and still pointed before\r\nhim; but remained silent Muttering a farewell that was not\r\ncomplimentary, Mr Carker pursued his way; but as he turned out of that\r\nplace, and looked over his shoulder at the root of the old tree, he\r\ncould yet see the finger pointing before him, and thought he heard the\r\nwoman screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cGo and meet her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPreparations for a choice repast were completed, he found, at the\r\nhotel; and Mr Dombey, and the Major, and the breakfast, were awaiting\r\nthe ladies. Individual constitution has much to do with the development\r\nof such facts, no doubt; but in this case, appetite carried it hollow\r\nover the tender passion; Mr Dombey being very cool and collected, and\r\nthe Major fretting and fuming in a state of violent heat and\r\nirritation. At length the door was thrown open by the Native, and,\r\nafter a pause, occupied by her languishing along the gallery, a very\r\nblooming, but not very youthful lady, appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we are late, but Edith\r\nhas been out already looking for a favourable point of view for a\r\nsketch, and kept me waiting for her. Falsest of Majors,\xe2\x80\x9d giving him her\r\nlittle finger, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Skewton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9clet me gratify my friend Carker:\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nDombey unconsciously emphasised the word friend, as saying \xe2\x80\x98no really;\r\nI do allow him to take credit for that distinction:\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cby presenting him\r\nto you. You have heard me mention Mr Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am charmed, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, graciously.\r\n\r\nMr Carker was charmed, of course. Would he have been more charmed on Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, if Mrs Skewton had been (as he at first supposed her)\r\nthe Edith whom they had toasted overnight?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, is Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Skewton,\r\nlooking round. \xe2\x80\x9cStill at the door, giving Withers orders about the\r\nmounting of those drawings! My dear Mr Dombey, will you have the\r\nkindness\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was already gone to seek her. Next moment he returned,\r\nbearing on his arm the same elegantly dressed and very handsome lady\r\nwhom Mr Carker had encountered underneath the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr Dombey. But their recognition of each other was so\r\nmanifest, that Mr Dombey stopped surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, with a stately bend, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nsparing me some annoyance from an importunate beggar just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to my good fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, bowing low, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nopportunity of rendering so slight a service to one whose servant I am\r\nproud to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs her eye rested on him for an instant, and then lighted on the\r\nground, he saw in its bright and searching glance a suspicion that he\r\nhad not come up at the moment of his interference, but had secretly\r\nobserved her sooner. As he saw that, she saw in his eye that her\r\ndistrust was not without foundation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, who had taken this opportunity of\r\ninspecting Mr Carker through her glass, and satisfying herself (as she\r\nlisped audibly to the Major) that he was all heart; \xe2\x80\x9creally now, this\r\nis one of the most enchanting coincidences that I ever heard of. The\r\nidea! My dearest Edith, there is such an obvious destiny in it, that\r\nreally one might almost be induced to cross one\xe2\x80\x99s arms upon one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrock, and say, like those wicked Turks, there is no What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\r\nbut Thingummy, and What-you-may-call-it is his prophet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith designed no revision of this extraordinary quotation from the\r\nKoran, but Mr Dombey felt it necessary to offer a few polite remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gives me great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with cumbrous gallantry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat a gentleman so nearly connected with myself as Carker is, should\r\nhave had the honour and happiness of rendering the least assistance to\r\nMrs Granger.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey bowed to her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it gives me some pain, and\r\nit occasions me to be really envious of Carker;\xe2\x80\x9d he unconsciously laid\r\nstress on these words, as sensible that they must appear to involve a\r\nvery surprising proposition; \xe2\x80\x9cenvious of Carker, that I had not that\r\nhonour and that happiness myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey bowed again. Edith, saving\r\nfor a curl of her lip, was motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, bursting into speech at sight of\r\nthe waiter, who was come to announce breakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary\r\nthing to me that no one can have the honour and happiness of shooting\r\nall such beggars through the head without being brought to book for it.\r\nBut here\xe2\x80\x99s an arm for Mrs Granger if she\xe2\x80\x99ll do J. B. the honour to\r\naccept it; and the greatest service Joe can render you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, just\r\nnow, is, to lead you into table!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, the Major gave his arm to Edith; Mr Dombey led the way with\r\nMrs Skewton; Mr Carker went last, smiling on the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite rejoiced, Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady-mother, at breakfast,\r\nafter another approving survey of him through her glass, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have\r\ntimed your visit so happily, as to go with us today. It is the most\r\nenchanting expedition!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny expedition would be enchanting in such society,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I believe it is, in itself, full of interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, with a faded little scream of rapture, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nCastle is charming!\xe2\x80\x94associations of the Middle Ages\xe2\x80\x94and all that\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis so truly exquisite. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dote upon the Middle Ages, Mr Carker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch charming times!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cSo full of faith! So vigorous\r\nand forcible! So picturesque! So perfectly removed from commonplace! Oh\r\ndear! If they would only leave us a little more of the poetry of\r\nexistence in these terrible days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton was looking sharp after Mr Dombey all the time she said\r\nthis, who was looking at Edith: who was listening, but who never lifted\r\nup her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are dreadfully real, Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton; \xe2\x80\x9care we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFew people had less reason to complain of their reality than Cleopatra,\r\nwho had as much that was false about her as could well go to the\r\ncomposition of anybody with a real individual existence. But Mr Carker\r\ncommiserated our reality nevertheless, and agreed that we were very\r\nhardly used in that regard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPictures at the Castle, quite divine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\r\ndote upon pictures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, Mrs Skewton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with solemn encouragement\r\nof his Manager, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Carker has a very good taste for pictures; quite\r\na natural power of appreciating them. He is a very creditable artist\r\nhimself. He will be delighted, I am sure, with Mrs Granger\xe2\x80\x99s taste and\r\nskill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Major Bagstock, \xe2\x80\x9cmy opinion is, that you\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nadmirable Carker, and can do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Carker, with humility, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are much too sanguine, Major\r\nBagstock. I can do very little. But Mr Dombey is so generous in his\r\nestimation of any trivial accomplishment a man like myself may find it\r\nalmost necessary to acquire, and to which, in his very different\r\nsphere, he is far superior, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Carker shrugged his shoulders,\r\ndeprecating further praise, and said no more.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Edith never raised her eyes, unless to glance towards\r\nher mother when that lady\xe2\x80\x99s fervent spirit shone forth in words. But as\r\nCarker ceased, she looked at Mr Dombey for a moment. For a moment only;\r\nbut with a transient gleam of scornful wonder on her face, not lost on\r\none observer, who was smiling round the board.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey caught the dark eyelash in its descent, and took the\r\nopportunity of arresting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been to Warwick often, unfortunately?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe visit will be tedious to you, I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are like your cousin Feenix, my dearest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nSkewton. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been to Warwick Castle fifty times, if he has been\r\nthere once; yet if he came to Leamington to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I wish he would,\r\ndear angel!\xe2\x80\x94he would make his fifty-second visit next day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all enthusiastic, are we not, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, with a cold\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much so, for our peace, perhaps, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her mother;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut we won\xe2\x80\x99t complain. Our own emotions are our recompense. If, as\r\nyour cousin Feenix says, the sword wears out the what\xe2\x80\x99s-its-name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scabbard, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly\xe2\x80\x94a little too fast, it is because it is bright and glowing, you\r\nknow, my dearest love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton heaved a gentle sigh, supposed to cast a shadow on the\r\nsurface of that dagger of lath, whereof her susceptible bosom was the\r\nsheath: and leaning her head on one side, in the Cleopatra manner,\r\nlooked with pensive affection on her darling child.\r\n\r\nEdith had turned her face towards Mr Dombey when he first addressed\r\nher, and had remained in that attitude, while speaking to her mother,\r\nand while her mother spoke to her, as though offering him her\r\nattention, if he had anything more to say. There was something in the\r\nmanner of this simple courtesy: almost defiant, and giving it the\r\ncharacter of being rendered on compulsion, or as a matter of traffic to\r\nwhich she was a reluctant party again not lost upon that same observer\r\nwho was smiling round the board. It set him thinking of her as he had\r\nfirst seen her, when she had believed herself to be alone among the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey having nothing else to say, proposed\xe2\x80\x94the breakfast being now\r\nfinished, and the Major gorged, like any Boa Constrictor\xe2\x80\x94that they\r\nshould start. A barouche being in waiting, according to the orders of\r\nthat gentleman, the two ladies, the Major and himself, took their seats\r\nin it; the Native and the wan page mounted the box, Mr Towlinson being\r\nleft behind; and Mr Carker, on horseback, brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nMr Carker cantered behind the carriage at the distance of a hundred\r\nyards or so, and watched it, during all the ride, as if he were a cat,\r\nindeed, and its four occupants, mice. Whether he looked to one side of\r\nthe road, or to the other\xe2\x80\x94over distant landscape, with its smooth\r\nundulations, wind-mills, corn, grass, bean fields, wild-flowers,\r\nfarm-yards, hayricks, and the spire among the wood\xe2\x80\x94or upwards in the\r\nsunny air, where butterflies were sporting round his head, and birds\r\nwere pouring out their songs\xe2\x80\x94or downward, where the shadows of the\r\nbranches interlaced, and made a trembling carpet on the road\xe2\x80\x94or onward,\r\nwhere the overhanging trees formed aisles and arches, dim with the\r\nsoftened light that steeped through leaves\xe2\x80\x94one corner of his eye was\r\never on the formal head of Mr Dombey, addressed towards him, and the\r\nfeather in the bonnet, drooping so neglectfully and scornfully between\r\nthem; much as he had seen the haughty eyelids droop; not least so, when\r\nthe face met that now fronting it. Once, and once only, did his wary\r\nglance release these objects; and that was, when a leap over a low\r\nhedge, and a gallop across a field, enabled him to anticipate the\r\ncarriage coming by the road, and to be standing ready, at the journey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend, to hand the ladies out. Then, and but then, he met her glance for\r\nan instant in her first surprise; but when he touched her, in\r\nalighting, with his soft white hand, it overlooked him altogether as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton was bent on taking charge of Mr Carker herself, and showing\r\nhim the beauties of the Castle. She was determined to have his arm, and\r\nthe Major\xe2\x80\x99s too. It would do that incorrigible creature: who was the\r\nmost barbarous infidel in point of poetry: good to be in such company.\r\nThis chance arrangement left Mr Dombey at liberty to escort Edith:\r\nwhich he did: stalking before them through the apartments with a\r\ngentlemanly solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose darling byegone times, Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cwith their\r\ndelicious fortresses, and their dear old dungeons, and their delightful\r\nplaces of torture, and their romantic vengeances, and their picturesque\r\nassaults and sieges, and everything that makes life truly charming! How\r\ndreadfully we have degenerated!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have fallen off deplorably,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of their conversation was, that Mrs Skewton, in spite\r\nof her ecstasies, and Mr Carker, in spite of his urbanity, were both\r\nintent on watching Mr Dombey and Edith. With all their conversational\r\nendowments, they spoke somewhat distractedly, and at random, in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no Faith left, positively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, advancing her\r\nshrivelled ear; for Mr Dombey was saying something to Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nno Faith in the dear old Barons, who were the most delightful\r\ncreatures\xe2\x80\x94or in the dear old Priests, who were the most warlike of\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94or even in the days of that inestimable Queen Bess, upon the wall\r\nthere, which were so extremely golden. Dear creature! She was all Heart\r\nAnd that charming father of hers! I hope you dote on Harry the Eighth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admire him very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo bluff!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? So burly. So truly English.\r\nSuch a picture, too, he makes, with his dear little peepy eyes, and his\r\nbenevolent chin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, stopping short; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you speak of\r\npictures, there\xe2\x80\x99s a composition! What gallery in the world can produce\r\nthe counterpart of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the smiling gentleman thus spake, he pointed through a doorway to\r\nwhere Mr Dombey and Edith were standing alone in the centre of another\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThey were not interchanging a word or a look. Standing together, arm in\r\narm, they had the appearance of being more divided than if seas had\r\nrolled between them. There was a difference even in the pride of the\r\ntwo, that removed them farther from each other, than if one had been\r\nthe proudest and the other the humblest specimen of humanity in all\r\ncreation. He, self-important, unbending, formal, austere. She, lovely\r\nand graceful, in an uncommon degree, but totally regardless of herself\r\nand him and everything around, and spurning her own attractions with\r\nher haughty brow and lip, as if they were a badge or livery she hated.\r\nSo unmatched were they, and opposed, so forced and linked together by a\r\nchain which adverse hazard and mischance had forged: that fancy might\r\nhave imagined the pictures on the walls around them, startled by the\r\nunnatural conjunction, and observant of it in their several\r\nexpressions. Grim knights and warriors looked scowling on them. A\r\nchurchman, with his hand upraised, denounced the mockery of such a\r\ncouple coming to God\xe2\x80\x99s altar. Quiet waters in landscapes, with the sun\r\nreflected in their depths, asked, if better means of escape were not at\r\nhand, was there no drowning left? Ruins cried, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, and see what\r\nWe are, wedded to uncongenial Time!\xe2\x80\x9d Animals, opposed by nature,\r\nworried one another, as a moral to them. Loves and Cupids took to\r\nflight afraid, and Martyrdom had no such torment in its painted history\r\nof suffering.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mrs Skewton was so charmed by the sight to which Mr\r\nCarker invoked her attention, that she could not refrain from saying,\r\nhalf aloud, how sweet, how very full of soul it was! Edith,\r\noverhearing, looked round, and flushed indignant scarlet to her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith knows I was admiring her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, tapping\r\nher, almost timidly, on the back with her parasol. \xe2\x80\x9cSweet pet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr Carker saw the strife he had witnessed so unexpectedly among\r\nthe trees. Again he saw the haughty languor and indifference come over\r\nit, and hide it like a cloud.\r\n\r\nShe did not raise her eyes to him; but with a slight peremptory motion\r\nof them, seemed to bid her mother come near. Mrs Skewton thought it\r\nexpedient to understand the hint, and advancing quickly, with her two\r\ncavaliers, kept near her daughter from that time.\r\n\r\nMr Carker now, having nothing to distract his attention, began to\r\ndiscourse upon the pictures and to select the best, and point them out\r\nto Mr Dombey: speaking with his usual familiar recognition of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s greatness, and rendering homage by adjusting his eye-glass for\r\nhim, or finding out the right place in his catalogue, or holding his\r\nstick, or the like. These services did not so much originate with Mr\r\nCarker, in truth, as with Mr Dombey himself, who was apt to assert his\r\nchieftainship by saying, with subdued authority, and in an easy way\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Carker, have the goodness to assist me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d which the\r\nsmiling gentleman always did with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThey made the tour of the pictures, the walls, crow\xe2\x80\x99s nest, and so\r\nforth; and as they were still one little party, and the Major was\r\nrather in the shade: being sleepy during the process of digestion: Mr\r\nCarker became communicative and agreeable. At first, he addressed\r\nhimself for the most part to Mrs Skewton; but as that sensitive lady\r\nwas in such ecstasies with the works of art, after the first quarter of\r\nan hour, that she could do nothing but yawn (they were such perfect\r\ninspirations, she observed as a reason for that mark of rapture), he\r\ntransferred his attentions to Mr Dombey. Mr Dombey said little beyond\r\nan occasional \xe2\x80\x9cVery true, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d but he tacitly\r\nencouraged Carker to proceed, and inwardly approved of his behaviour\r\nvery much: deeming it as well that somebody should talk, and thinking\r\nthat his remarks, which were, as one might say, a branch of the parent\r\nestablishment, might amuse Mrs Granger. Mr Carker, who possessed an\r\nexcellent discretion, never took the liberty of addressing that lady,\r\ndirect; but she seemed to listen, though she never looked at him; and\r\nonce or twice, when he was emphatic in his peculiar humility, the\r\ntwilight smile stole over her face, not as a light, but as a deep black\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nWarwick Castle being at length pretty well exhausted, and the Major\r\nvery much so: to say nothing of Mrs Skewton, whose peculiar\r\ndemonstrations of delight had become very frequent Indeed: the carriage\r\nwas again put in requisition, and they rode to several admired points\r\nof view in the neighbourhood. Mr Dombey ceremoniously observed of one\r\nof these, that a sketch, however slight, from the fair hand of Mrs\r\nGranger, would be a remembrance to him of that agreeable day: though he\r\nwanted no artificial remembrance, he was sure (here Mr Dombey made\r\nanother of his bows), which he must always highly value. Withers the\r\nlean having Edith\xe2\x80\x99s sketch-book under his arm, was immediately called\r\nupon by Mrs Skewton to produce the same: and the carriage stopped, that\r\nEdith might make the drawing, which Mr Dombey was to put away among his\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am afraid I trouble you too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. Where would you wish it taken from?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\r\nturning to him with the same enforced attention as before.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, with another bow, which cracked the starch in his cravat,\r\nwould beg to leave that to the Artist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you chose for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cwe say from here. It appears a good\r\nspot for the purpose, or\xe2\x80\x94Carker, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere happened to be in the foreground, at some little distance, a\r\ngrove of trees, not unlike that in which Mr Carker had made his chain\r\nof footsteps in the morning, and with a seat under one tree, greatly\r\nresembling, in the general character of its situation, the point where\r\nhis chain had broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I venture to suggest to Mrs Granger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that is\r\nan interesting\xe2\x80\x94almost a curious\xe2\x80\x94point of view?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed the direction of his riding-whip with her eyes, and raised\r\nthem quickly to his face. It was the second glance they had exchanged\r\nsince their introduction; and would have been exactly like the first,\r\nbut that its expression was plainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith to Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be charmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey to Edith.\r\n\r\nTherefore the carriage was driven to the spot where Mr Dombey was to be\r\ncharmed; and Edith, without moving from her seat, and opening her\r\nsketch-book with her usual proud indifference, began to sketch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pencils are all pointless,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, stopping and turning them\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cOr Carker will do it better, as he\r\nunderstands these things. Carker, have the goodness to see to these\r\npencils for Mrs Granger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker rode up close to the carriage-door on Mrs Granger\xe2\x80\x99s side, and\r\nletting the rein fall on his horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck, took the pencils from her\r\nhand with a smile and a bow, and sat in the saddle leisurely mending\r\nthem. Having done so, he begged to be allowed to hold them, and to hand\r\nthem to her as they were required; and thus Mr Carker, with many\r\ncommendations of Mrs Granger\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary skill\xe2\x80\x94especially in\r\ntrees\xe2\x80\x94remained\xe2\x80\x94close at her side, looking over the drawing as she made\r\nit. Mr Dombey in the meantime stood bolt upright in the carriage like a\r\nhighly respectable ghost, looking on too; while Cleopatra and the Major\r\ndallied as two ancient doves might do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied with that, or shall I finish it a little more?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEdith, showing the sketch to Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey begged that it might not be touched; it was perfection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, bringing every one of his red\r\ngums to bear upon his praise. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not prepared for anything so\r\nbeautiful, and so unusual altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis might have applied to the sketcher no less than to the sketch; but\r\nMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s manner was openness itself\xe2\x80\x94not as to his mouth alone, but\r\nas to his whole spirit. So it continued to be while the drawing was\r\nlaid aside for Mr Dombey, and while the sketching materials were put\r\nup; then he handed in the pencils (which were received with a distant\r\nacknowledgment of his help, but without a look), and tightening his\r\nrein, fell back, and followed the carriage again.\r\n\r\nThinking, perhaps, as he rode, that even this trivial sketch had been\r\nmade and delivered to its owner, as if it had been bargained for and\r\nbought. Thinking, perhaps, that although she had assented with such\r\nperfect readiness to his request, her haughty face, bent over the\r\ndrawing, or glancing at the distant objects represented in it, had been\r\nthe face of a proud woman, engaged in a sordid and miserable\r\ntransaction. Thinking, perhaps, of such things: but smiling certainly,\r\nand while he seemed to look about him freely, in enjoyment of the air\r\nand exercise, keeping always that sharp corner of his eye upon the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nA stroll among the haunted ruins of Kenilworth, and more rides to more\r\npoints of view: most of which, Mrs Skewton reminded Mr Dombey, Edith\r\nhad already sketched, as he had seen in looking over her drawings:\r\nbrought the day\xe2\x80\x99s expedition to a close. Mrs Skewton and Edith were\r\ndriven to their own lodgings; Mr Carker was graciously invited by\r\nCleopatra to return thither with Mr Dombey and the Major, in the\r\nevening, to hear some of Edith\xe2\x80\x99s music; and the three gentlemen\r\nrepaired to their hotel to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was the counterpart of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s, except that the Major\r\nwas twenty-four hours more triumphant and less mysterious. Edith was\r\ntoasted again. Mr Dombey was again agreeably embarrassed. And Mr Carker\r\nwas full of interest and praise.\r\n\r\nThere were no other visitors at Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s. Edith\xe2\x80\x99s drawings were\r\nstrewn about the room, a little more abundantly than usual perhaps; and\r\nWithers, the wan page, handed round a little stronger tea. The harp was\r\nthere; the piano was there; and Edith sang and played. But even the\r\nmusic was played by Edith to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s order, as it were, in the same\r\nuncompromising way. As thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my dearest love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, half an hour after tea, \xe2\x80\x9cMr\r\nDombey is dying to hear you, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey has life enough left to say so for himself, Mama, I have no\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be immensely obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiano?\xe2\x80\x9d hesitated Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you please. You have only to choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she began with the piano. It was the same with the harp;\r\nthe same with her singing; the same with the selection of the pieces\r\nthat she sang and played. Such frigid and constrained, yet prompt and\r\npointed acquiescence with the wishes he imposed upon her, and on no one\r\nelse, was sufficiently remarkable to penetrate through all the\r\nmysteries of picquet, and impress itself on Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s keen attention.\r\nNor did he lose sight of the fact that Mr Dombey was evidently proud of\r\nhis power, and liked to show it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr Carker played so well\xe2\x80\x94some games with the Major, and\r\nsome with Cleopatra, whose vigilance of eye in respect of Mr Dombey and\r\nEdith no lynx could have surpassed\xe2\x80\x94that he even heightened his position\r\nin the lady-mother\xe2\x80\x99s good graces; and when on taking leave he regretted\r\nthat he would be obliged to return to London next morning, Cleopatra\r\ntrusted: community of feeling not being met with every day: that it was\r\nfar from being the last time they would meet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with an expressive look at the couple in\r\nthe distance, as he drew towards the door, following the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, who had taken a stately leave of Edith, bent, or made some\r\napproach to a bend, over Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s couch, and said, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have requested Mrs Granger\xe2\x80\x99s permission to call on her to-morrow\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94for a purpose\xe2\x80\x94and she has appointed twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. May I hope\r\nto have the pleasure of finding you at home, Madam, afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra was so much fluttered and moved, by hearing this, of course,\r\nincomprehensible speech, that she could only shut her eyes, and shake\r\nher head, and give Mr Dombey her hand; which Mr Dombey, not exactly\r\nknowing what to do with, dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, looking in at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme,\r\nSir, old Joe has a great mind to propose an alteration in the name of\r\nthe Royal Hotel, and that it should be called the Three Jolly\r\nBachelors, in honour of ourselves and Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d With this, the Major\r\nslapped Mr Dombey on the back, and winking over his shoulder at the\r\nladies, with a frightful tendency of blood to the head, carried him\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton reposed on her sofa, and Edith sat apart, by her harp, in\r\nsilence. The mother, trifling with her fan, looked stealthily at the\r\ndaughter more than once, but the daughter, brooding gloomily with\r\ndowncast eyes, was not to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nThus they remained for a long hour, without a word, until Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid appeared, according to custom, to prepare her gradually for night.\r\nAt night, she should have been a skeleton, with dart and hour-glass,\r\nrather than a woman, this attendant; for her touch was as the touch of\r\nDeath. The painted object shrivelled underneath her hand; the form\r\ncollapsed, the hair dropped off, the arched dark eyebrows changed to\r\nscanty tufts of grey; the pale lips shrunk, the skin became cadaverous\r\nand loose; an old, worn, yellow, nodding woman, with red eyes, alone\r\nremained in Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s place, huddled up, like a slovenly bundle, in a\r\ngreasy flannel gown.\r\n\r\nThe very voice was changed, as it addressed Edith, when they were alone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d it said sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is coming here\r\nto-morrow by appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you know it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cMother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mocking emphasis she laid on that one word!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he has bought me,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cOr that he will, to-morrow.\r\nHe has considered of his bargain; he has shown it to his friend; he is\r\neven rather proud of it; he thinks that it will suit him, and may be\r\nhad sufficiently cheap; and he will buy to-morrow. God, that I have\r\nlived for this, and that I feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCompress into one handsome face the conscious self-abasement, and the\r\nburning indignation of a hundred women, strong in passion and in pride;\r\nand there it hid itself with two white shuddering arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the angry mother. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you from a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen was I a child? What\r\nchildhood did you ever leave to me? I was a woman\xe2\x80\x94artful, designing,\r\nmercenary, laying snares for men\xe2\x80\x94before I knew myself, or you, or even\r\nunderstood the base and wretched aim of every new display I learnt You\r\ngave birth to a woman. Look upon her. She is in her pride tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as she spoke, she struck her hand upon her beautiful bosom, as\r\nthough she would have beaten down herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have never known what it is to have an\r\nhonest heart, and love. Look at me, taught to scheme and plot when\r\nchildren play; and married in my youth\xe2\x80\x94an old age of design\xe2\x80\x94to one for\r\nwhom I had no feeling but indifference. Look at me, whom he left a\r\nwidow, dying before his inheritance descended to him\xe2\x80\x94a judgment on you!\r\nwell deserved!\xe2\x80\x94and tell me what has been my life for ten years since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been making every effort to endeavour to secure to you a good\r\nestablishment,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThat has been your life. And now\r\nyou have got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no slave in a market: there is no horse in a fair: so shown\r\nand offered and examined and paraded, Mother, as I have been, for ten\r\nshameful years,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edith, with a burning brow, and the same bitter\r\nemphasis on the one word. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not so? Have I been made the bye-word\r\nof all kinds of men? Have fools, have profligates, have boys, have\r\ndotards, dangled after me, and one by one rejected me, and fallen off,\r\nbecause you were too plain with all your cunning: yes, and too true,\r\nwith all those false pretences: until we have almost come to be\r\nnotorious? The licence of look and touch,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with flashing\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x9chave I submitted to it, in half the places of resort upon the\r\nmap of England? Have I been hawked and vended here and there, until the\r\nlast grain of self-respect is dead within me, and I loathe myself? Has\r\nbeen my late childhood? I had none before. Do not tell me that I had,\r\ntonight of all nights in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have been well married,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty times at\r\nleast, Edith, if you had given encouragement enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Who takes me, refuse that I am, and as I well deserve to be,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, raising her head, and trembling in her energy of shame and\r\nstormy pride, \xe2\x80\x9cshall take me, as this man does, with no art of mine put\r\nforth to lure him. He sees me at the auction, and he thinks it well to\r\nbuy me. Let him! When he came to view me\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to bid\xe2\x80\x94he required to\r\nsee the roll of my accomplishments. I gave it to him. When he would\r\nhave me show one of them, to justify his purchase to his men, I require\r\nof him to say which he demands, and I exhibit it. I will do no more. He\r\nmakes the purchase of his own will, and with his own sense of its\r\nworth, and the power of his money; and I hope it may never disappoint\r\nhim. I have not vaunted and pressed the bargain; neither have you, so\r\nfar as I have been able to prevent you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk strangely tonight, Edith, to your own Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so to me; stranger to me than you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my\r\neducation was completed long ago. I am too old now, and have fallen too\r\nlow, by degrees, to take a new course, and to stop yours, and to help\r\nmyself. The germ of all that purifies a woman\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and makes it\r\ntrue and good, has never stirred in mine, and I have nothing else to\r\nsustain me when I despise myself.\xe2\x80\x9d There had been a touching sadness in\r\nher voice, but it was gone, when she went on to say, with a curled lip,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, as we are genteel and poor, I am content that we should be made\r\nrich by these means; all I say is, I have kept the only purpose I have\r\nhad the strength to form\xe2\x80\x94I had almost said the power, with you at my\r\nside, Mother\xe2\x80\x94and have not tempted this man on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man! You speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cas if you hated him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you thought I loved him, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, stopping on\r\nher way across the room, and looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, with her eyes fixed on her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwho already knows us\r\nthoroughly, and reads us right, and before whom I have even less of\r\nself-respect or confidence than before my own inward self; being so\r\nmuch degraded by his knowledge of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an attack, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her mother coldly, \xe2\x80\x9con poor,\r\nunfortunate what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\xe2\x80\x94Mr Carker! Your want of self-respect and\r\nconfidence, my dear, in reference to that person (who is very\r\nagreeable, it strikes me), is not likely to have much effect on your\r\nestablishment. Why do you look at me so hard? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith suddenly let fall her face, as if it had been stung, and while\r\nshe pressed her hands upon it, a terrible tremble crept over her whole\r\nframe. It was quickly gone; and with her usual step, she passed out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe maid who should have been a skeleton, then reappeared, and giving\r\none arm to her mistress, who appeared to have taken off her manner with\r\nher charms, and to have put on paralysis with her flannel gown,\r\ncollected the ashes of Cleopatra, and carried them away in the other,\r\nready for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s revivification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nAlterations\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the day has come at length, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence to the excellent\r\nNipper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we are going back to our quiet home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan drew in her breath with an amount of expression not easily\r\ndescribed, further relieving her feelings with a smart cough, answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery quiet indeed, Miss Floy, no doubt. Excessive so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, thoughtfully, and after musing for\r\nsome moments, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever see that gentleman who has taken the\r\ntrouble to ride down here to speak to me, now three times\xe2\x80\x94three times,\r\nI think, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce when you was out a\r\nwalking with them Sket\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence gently looked at her, and Miss Nipper checked herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Sir Barnet and his lady, I mean to say, Miss, and the young\r\ngentleman. And two evenings since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a child, and when company used to come to visit Papa, did\r\nyou ever see that gentleman at home, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her maid, after considering, \xe2\x80\x9cI really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I ever did. When your poor dear Ma died, Miss Floy, I was very new\r\nin the family, you see, and my element:\xe2\x80\x9d the Nipper bridled, as opining\r\nthat her merits had been always designedly extinguished by Mr Dombey:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas the floor below the attics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, still thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not likely to\r\nhave known who came to the house. I quite forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot, Miss, but what we talked about the family and visitors,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSusan, \xe2\x80\x9cand but what I heard much said, although the nurse before Mrs\r\nRichards make unpleasant remarks when I was in company, and hint at\r\nlittle Pitchers, but that could only be attributed, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Susan, with composed forbearance, \xe2\x80\x9cto habits of intoxication,\r\nfor which she was required to leave, and did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence, who was seated at her chamber window, with her face resting\r\non her hand, sat looking out, and hardly seemed to hear what Susan\r\nsaid, she was so lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember very well that this same\r\ngentleman, Mr Carker, was almost, if not quite, as great a gentleman\r\nwith your Papa then, as he is now. It used to be said in the house\r\nthen, Miss, that he was at the head of all your Pa\xe2\x80\x99s affairs in the\r\nCity, and managed the whole, and that your Pa minded him more than\r\nanybody, which, begging your pardon, Miss Floy, he might easy do, for\r\nhe never minded anybody else. I knew that, Pitcher as I might have\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper, with an injured remembrance of the nurse before Mrs\r\nRichards, emphasised \xe2\x80\x9cPitcher\xe2\x80\x9d strongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Mr Carker has not fallen off, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut has\r\nstood his ground, and kept his credit with your Pa, I know from what is\r\nalways said among our people by that Perch, whenever he comes to the\r\nhouse; and though he\xe2\x80\x99s the weakest weed in the world, Miss Floy, and no\r\none can have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s patience with the man, he knows what goes on in\r\nthe City tolerable well, and says that your Pa does nothing without Mr\r\nCarker, and leaves all to Mr Carker, and acts according to Mr Carker,\r\nand has Mr Carker always at his elbow, and I do believe that he\r\nbelieves (that washiest of Perches!) that after your Pa, the Emperor of\r\nIndia is the child unborn to Mr Carker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a word of this was lost on Florence, who, with an awakened interest\r\nin Susan\xe2\x80\x99s speech, no longer gazed abstractedly on the prospect\r\nwithout, but looked at her, and listened with attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when that young lady had concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and is his friend, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x99s mind ran high on this theme, and had done for some days. Mr\r\nCarker, in the two visits with which he had followed up his first one,\r\nhad assumed a confidence between himself and her\xe2\x80\x94a right on his part to\r\nbe mysterious and stealthy, in telling her that the ship was still\r\nunheard of\xe2\x80\x94a kind of mildly restrained power and authority over\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94that made her wonder, and caused her great uneasiness. She had no\r\nmeans of repelling it, or of freeing herself from the web he was\r\ngradually winding about her; for that would have required some art and\r\nknowledge of the world, opposed to such address as his; and Florence\r\nhad none. True, he had said no more to her than that there was no news\r\nof the ship, and that he feared the worst; but how he came to know that\r\nshe was interested in the ship, and why he had the right to signify his\r\nknowledge to her, so insidiously and darkly, troubled Florence very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThis conduct on the part of Mr Carker, and her habit of often\r\nconsidering it with wonder and uneasiness, began to invest him with an\r\nuncomfortable fascination in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. A more distinct\r\nremembrance of his features, voice, and manner: which she sometimes\r\ncourted, as a means of reducing him to the level of a real personage,\r\ncapable of exerting no greater charm over her than another: did not\r\nremove the vague impression. And yet he never frowned, or looked upon\r\nher with an air of dislike or animosity, but was always smiling and\r\nserene.\r\n\r\nAgain, Florence, in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her\r\nfather, and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself\r\nunwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations, would\r\nrecall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend, and\r\nwould think, with an anxious heart, could her struggling tendency to\r\ndislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her, which had\r\nturned her father\xe2\x80\x99s love adrift, and left her so alone? She dreaded\r\nthat it might be; sometimes believed it was: then she resolved that she\r\nwould try to conquer this wrong feeling; persuaded herself that she was\r\nhonoured and encouraged by the notice of her father\xe2\x80\x99s friend; and hoped\r\nthat patient observation of him and trust in him would lead her\r\nbleeding feet along that stony road which ended in her father\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nThus, with no one to advise her\xe2\x80\x94for she could advise with no one\r\nwithout seeming to complain against him\xe2\x80\x94gentle Florence tossed on an\r\nuneasy sea of doubt and hope; and Mr Carker, like a scaly monster of\r\nthe deep, swam down below, and kept his shining eye upon her.\r\n\r\nFlorence had a new reason in all this for wishing to be at home again.\r\nHer lonely life was better suited to her course of timid hope and\r\ndoubt; and she feared sometimes, that in her absence she might miss\r\nsome hopeful chance of testifying her affection for her father. Heaven\r\nknows, she might have set her mind at rest, poor child! on this last\r\npoint; but her slighted love was fluttering within her, and, even in\r\nher sleep, it flew away in dreams, and nestled, like a wandering bird\r\ncome home, upon her father\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\nOf Walter she thought often. Ah! how often, when the night was gloomy,\r\nand the wind was blowing round the house! But hope was strong in her\r\nbreast. It is so difficult for the young and ardent, even with such\r\nexperience as hers, to imagine youth and ardour quenched like a weak\r\nflame, and the bright day of life merging into night, at noon, that\r\nhope was strong yet. Her tears fell frequently for Walter\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings;\r\nbut rarely for his supposed death, and never long.\r\n\r\nShe had written to the old Instrument-maker, but had received no answer\r\nto her note: which indeed required none. Thus matters stood with\r\nFlorence on the morning when she was going home, gladly, to her old\r\nsecluded life.\r\n\r\nDoctor and Mrs Blimber, accompanied (much against his will) by their\r\nvalued charge, Master Barnet, were already gone back to Brighton, where\r\nthat young gentleman and his fellow-pilgrims to Parnassus were then, no\r\ndoubt, in the continual resumption of their studies. The holiday time\r\nwas past and over; most of the juvenile guests at the villa had taken\r\ntheir departure; and Florence\xe2\x80\x99s long visit was come to an end.\r\n\r\nThere was one guest, however, albeit not resident within the house, who\r\nhad been very constant in his attentions to the family, and who still\r\nremained devoted to them. This was Mr Toots, who after renewing, some\r\nweeks ago, the acquaintance he had had the happiness of forming with\r\nSkettles Junior, on the night when he burst the Blimberian bonds and\r\nsoared into freedom with his ring on, called regularly every other day,\r\nand left a perfect pack of cards at the hall-door; so many indeed, that\r\nthe ceremony was quite a deal on the part of Mr Toots, and a hand at\r\nwhist on the part of the servant.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, likewise, with the bold and happy idea of preventing the\r\nfamily from forgetting him (but there is reason to suppose that this\r\nexpedient originated in the teeming brain of the Chicken), had\r\nestablished a six-oared cutter, manned by aquatic friends of the\r\nChicken\xe2\x80\x99s and steered by that illustrious character in person, who wore\r\na bright red fireman\xe2\x80\x99s coat for the purpose, and concealed the\r\nperpetual black eye with which he was afflicted, beneath a green shade.\r\nPrevious to the institution of this equipage, Mr Toots sounded the\r\nChicken on a hypothetical case, as, supposing the Chicken to be\r\nenamoured of a young lady named Mary, and to have conceived the\r\nintention of starting a boat of his own, what would he call that boat?\r\nThe Chicken replied, with divers strong asseverations, that he would\r\neither christen it Poll or The Chicken\xe2\x80\x99s Delight. Improving on this\r\nidea, Mr Toots, after deep study and the exercise of much invention,\r\nresolved to call his boat The Toots\xe2\x80\x99s Joy, as a delicate compliment to\r\nFlorence, of which no man knowing the parties, could possibly miss the\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nStretched on a crimson cushion in his gallant bark, with his shoes in\r\nthe air, Mr Toots, in the exercise of his project, had come up the\r\nriver, day after day, and week after week, and had flitted to and fro,\r\nnear Sir Barnet\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and had caused his crew to cut across and\r\nacross the river at sharp angles, for his better exhibition to any\r\nlookers-out from Sir Barnet\xe2\x80\x99s windows, and had had such evolutions\r\nperformed by the Toots\xe2\x80\x99s Joy as had filled all the neighbouring part of\r\nthe water-side with astonishment. But whenever he saw anyone in Sir\r\nBarnet\xe2\x80\x99s garden on the brink of the river, Mr Toots always feigned to\r\nbe passing there, by a combination of coincidences of the most singular\r\nand unlikely description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Toots?\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Barnet would say, waving his hand from the\r\nlawn, while the artful Chicken steered close in shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow de do, Sir Barnet?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would answer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a surprising\r\nthing that I should see you here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots, in his sagacity, always said this, as if, instead of that\r\nbeing Sir Barnet\xe2\x80\x99s house, it were some deserted edifice on the banks of\r\nthe Nile, or Ganges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was so surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would exclaim.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Dombey\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Florence would appear, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diogenes is quite well, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d Toots would cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI called\r\nto ask this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much!\xe2\x80\x9d the pleasant voice of Florence would reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come ashore, Toots?\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Barnet would say then. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re in no hurry. Come and see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots would blushingly\r\nrejoin. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought Miss Dombey might like to know, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d And poor Mr Toots, who was dying to accept the invitation,\r\nbut hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage to do it, signed to the Chicken, with an aching\r\nheart, and away went the Joy, cleaving the water like an arrow.\r\n\r\nThe Joy was lying in a state of extraordinary splendour, at the garden\r\nsteps, on the morning of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s departure. When she went downstairs\r\nto take leave, after her talk with Susan, she found Mr Toots awaiting\r\nher in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how de do, Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stricken Toots, always\r\ndreadfully disconcerted when the desire of his heart was gained, and he\r\nwas speaking to her; \xe2\x80\x9cthank you, I\xe2\x80\x99m very well indeed, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe same, so was Diogenes yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nperhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, in this fine weather, coming home by water,\r\nMiss Dombey. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room in the boat for your maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, hesitating. \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94but I would rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you wait and see Lady Skettles?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo shy was Mr Toots on such occasions, and so flurried! But Lady\r\nSkettles entering at the moment, Mr Toots was suddenly seized with a\r\npassion for asking her how she did, and hoping she was very well; nor\r\ncould Mr Toots by any possibility leave off shaking hands with her,\r\nuntil Sir Barnet appeared: to whom he immediately clung with the\r\ntenacity of desperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are losing, today, Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Barnet, turning towards\r\nFlorence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe light of our house, I assure you\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no conseq\xe2\x80\x94I mean yes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the\r\nembarrassed Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the emphatic nature of this farewell, Mr Toots, instead\r\nof going away, stood leering about him, vacantly. Florence, to relieve\r\nhim, bade adieu, with many thanks, to Lady Skettles, and gave her arm\r\nto Sir Barnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I beg of you, my dear Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said her host, as he conducted\r\nher to the carriage, \xe2\x80\x9cto present my best compliments to your dear\r\nPapa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was distressing to Florence to receive the commission, for she felt\r\nas if she were imposing on Sir Barnet by allowing him to believe that a\r\nkindness rendered to her, was rendered to her father. As she could not\r\nexplain, however, she bowed her head and thanked him; and again she\r\nthought that the dull home, free from such embarrassments, and such\r\nreminders of her sorrow, was her natural and best retreat.\r\n\r\nSuch of her late friends and companions as were yet remaining at the\r\nvilla, came running from within, and from the garden, to say good-bye.\r\nThey were all attached to her, and very earnest in taking leave of her.\r\nEven the household were sorry for her going, and the servants came\r\nnodding and curtseying round the carriage door. As Florence looked\r\nround on the kind faces, and saw among them those of Sir Barnet and his\r\nlady, and of Mr Toots, who was chuckling and staring at her from a\r\ndistance, she was reminded of the night when Paul and she had come from\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s: and when the carriage drove away, her face was wet\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\nSorrowful tears, but tears of consolation, too; for all the softer\r\nmemories connected with the dull old house to which she was returning\r\nmade it dear to her, as they rose up. How long it seemed since she had\r\nwandered through the silent rooms: since she had last crept, softly and\r\nafraid, into those her father occupied: since she had felt the solemn\r\nbut yet soothing influence of the beloved dead in every action of her\r\ndaily life! This new farewell reminded her, besides, of her parting\r\nwith poor Walter: of his looks and words that night: and of the\r\ngracious blending she had noticed in him, of tenderness for those he\r\nleft behind, with courage and high spirit. His little history was\r\nassociated with the old house too, and gave it a new claim and hold\r\nupon her heart.\r\n\r\nEven Susan Nipper softened towards the home of so many years, as they\r\nwere on their way towards it. Gloomy as it was, and rigid justice as\r\nshe rendered to its gloom, she forgave it a great deal. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nglad to see it again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t much in it to boast of, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it burnt or pulled\r\ndown, neither!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to go through the old rooms, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFlorence, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Nipper, softening more and more towards the\r\nhouse, as they approached it nearer, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t deny but what I shall,\r\nthough I shall hate \xe2\x80\x99em again, to-morrow, very likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence felt that, for her, there was greater peace within it than\r\nelsewhere. It was better and easier to keep her secret shut up there,\r\namong the tall dark walls, than to carry it abroad into the light, and\r\ntry to hide it from a crowd of happy eyes. It was better to pursue the\r\nstudy of her loving heart, alone, and find no new discouragements in\r\nloving hearts about her. It was easier to hope, and pray, and love on,\r\nall uncared for, yet with constancy and patience, in the tranquil\r\nsanctuary of such remembrances: although it mouldered, rusted, and\r\ndecayed about her: than in a new scene, let its gaiety be what it\r\nwould. She welcomed back her old enchanted dream of life, and longed\r\nfor the old dark door to close upon her, once again.\r\n\r\nFull of such thoughts, they turned into the long and sombre street.\r\nFlorence was not on that side of the carriage which was nearest to her\r\nhome, and as the distance lessened between them and it, she looked out\r\nof her window for the children over the way.\r\n\r\nShe was thus engaged, when an exclamation from Susan caused her to turn\r\nquickly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Gracious me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, breathless, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s our house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur house!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\nSusan, drawing in her head from the window, thrust it out again, drew\r\nit in again as the carriage stopped, and stared at her mistress in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nThere was a labyrinth of scaffolding raised all round the house, from\r\nthe basement to the roof. Loads of bricks and stones, and heaps of\r\nmortar, and piles of wood, blocked up half the width and length of the\r\nbroad street at the side. Ladders were raised against the walls;\r\nlabourers were climbing up and down; men were at work upon the steps of\r\nthe scaffolding; painters and decorators were busy inside; great rolls\r\nof ornamental paper were being delivered from a cart at the door; an\r\nupholsterer\xe2\x80\x99s waggon also stopped the way; no furniture was to be seen\r\nthrough the gaping and broken windows in any of the rooms; nothing but\r\nworkmen, and the implements of their several trades, swarming from the\r\nkitchens to the garrets. Inside and outside alike: bricklayers,\r\npainters, carpenters, masons: hammer, hod, brush, pickaxe, saw, and\r\ntrowel: all at work together, in full chorus!\r\n\r\nFlorence descended from the coach, half doubting if it were, or could\r\nbe the right house, until she recognised Towlinson, with a sun-burnt\r\nface, standing at the door to receive her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are great alterations going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss, great alterations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson.\r\n\r\nFlorence passed him as if she were in a dream, and hurried upstairs.\r\nThe garish light was in the long-darkened drawing-room and there were\r\nsteps and platforms, and men in paper caps, in the high places. Her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s picture was gone with the rest of the moveables, and on the\r\nmark where it had been, was scrawled in chalk, \xe2\x80\x9cthis room in panel.\r\nGreen and gold.\xe2\x80\x9d The staircase was a labyrinth of posts and planks like\r\nthe outside of the house, and a whole Olympus of plumbers and glaziers\r\nwas reclining in various attitudes, on the skylight. Her own room was\r\nnot yet touched within, but there were beams and boards raised against\r\nit without, baulking the daylight. She went up swiftly to that other\r\nbedroom, where the little bed was; and a dark giant of a man with a\r\npipe in his mouth, and his head tied up in a pocket-handkerchief, was\r\nstaring in at the window.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Susan Nipper, who had been in quest of Florence, found\r\nher, and said, would she go downstairs to her Papa, who wished to speak\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home! and wishing to speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, trembling.\r\n\r\nSusan, who was infinitely more distraught than Florence herself,\r\nrepeated her errand; and Florence, pale and agitated, hurried down\r\nagain, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. She thought upon the way down,\r\nwould she dare to kiss him? The longing of her heart resolved her, and\r\nshe thought she would.\r\n\r\nHer father might have heard that heart beat, when it came into his\r\npresence. One instant, and it would have beat against his breast.\r\n\r\nBut he was not alone. There were two ladies there; and Florence\r\nstopped. Striving so hard with her emotion, that if her brute friend Di\r\nhad not burst in and overwhelmed her with his caresses as a welcome\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94at which one of the ladies gave a little scream, and that diverted\r\nher attention from herself\xe2\x80\x94she would have swooned upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, putting out his hand: so stiffly that it\r\nheld her off: \xe2\x80\x9chow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFlorence took the hand between her own, and putting it timidly to her\r\nlips, yielded to its withdrawal. It touched the door in shutting it,\r\nwith quite as much endearment as it had touched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dog is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, displeased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a dog, Papa\xe2\x80\x94from Brighton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey; and a cloud passed over his face, for he\r\nunderstood her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very good-tempered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, addressing herself with her\r\nnatural grace and sweetness to the two lady strangers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is only glad\r\nto see me. Pray forgive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw in the glance they interchanged, that the lady who had\r\nscreamed, and who was seated, was old; and that the other lady, who\r\nstood near her Papa, was very beautiful, and of an elegant figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Skewton,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, turning to the first, and holding out\r\nhis hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my daughter Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the lady, putting up her glass. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nnatural! My darling Florence, you must kiss me, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence having done so, turned towards the other lady, by whom her\r\nfather stood waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my daughter Florence. Florence, this\r\nlady will soon be your Mama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence started, and looked up at the beautiful face in a conflict of\r\nemotions, among which the tears that name awakened, struggled for a\r\nmoment with surprise, interest, admiration, and an indefinable sort of\r\nfear. Then she cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Papa, may you be happy! may you be very,\r\nvery happy all your life!\xe2\x80\x9d and then fell weeping on the lady\xe2\x80\x99s bosom.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence. The beautiful lady, who at first had seemed\r\nto hesitate whether or no she should advance to Florence, held her to\r\nher breast, and pressed the hand with which she clasped her, close\r\nabout her waist, as if to reassure her and comfort her. Not one word\r\npassed the lady\xe2\x80\x99s lips. She bent her head down over Florence, and she\r\nkissed her on the cheek, but she said no word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go on through the rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cand see how our\r\nworkmen are doing? Pray allow me, my dear madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this in offering his arm to Mrs Skewton, who had been looking\r\nat Florence through her glass, as though picturing to herself what she\r\nmight be made, by the infusion\xe2\x80\x94from her own copious storehouse, no\r\ndoubt\xe2\x80\x94of a little more Heart and Nature. Florence was still sobbing on\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and holding to her, when Mr Dombey was heard to say\r\nfrom the Conservatory:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us ask Edith. Dear me, where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you? Looking for Mr\r\nDombey somewhere, I know. We are here, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beautiful lady released her hold of Florence, and pressing her lips\r\nonce more upon her face, withdrew hurriedly, and joined them. Florence\r\nremained standing in the same place: happy, sorry, joyful, and in\r\ntears, she knew not how, or how long, but all at once: when her new\r\nMama came back, and took her in her arms again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, hurriedly, and looking into her face with\r\ngreat earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not begin by hating me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy hating you, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, winding her arm round her neck,\r\nand returning the look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! Begin by thinking well of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beautiful lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin\r\nby believing that I will try to make you happy, and that I am prepared\r\nto love you, Florence. Good-bye. We shall meet again soon. Good-bye!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t stay here, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she pressed her to her breast she had spoken in a rapid manner,\r\nbut firmly\xe2\x80\x94and Florence saw her rejoin them in the other room.\r\n\r\nAnd now Florence began to hope that she would learn from her new and\r\nbeautiful Mama, how to gain her father\xe2\x80\x99s love; and in her sleep that\r\nnight, in her lost old home, her own Mama smiled radiantly upon the\r\nhope, and blessed it. Dreaming Florence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nThe Opening of the Eyes of Mrs Chick\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, all unconscious of any such rare appearances in connexion\r\nwith Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, as scaffoldings and ladders, and men with their\r\nheads tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs, glaring in at the windows like\r\nflying genii or strange birds,\xe2\x80\x94having breakfasted one morning at about\r\nthis eventful period of time, on her customary viands; to wit, one\r\nFrench roll rasped, one egg new laid (or warranted to be), and one\r\nlittle pot of tea, wherein was infused one little silver scoopful of\r\nthat herb on behalf of Miss Tox, and one little silver scoopful on\r\nbehalf of the teapot\xe2\x80\x94a flight of fancy in which good housekeepers\r\ndelight; went upstairs to set forth the bird waltz on the harpsichord,\r\nto water and arrange the plants, to dust the nick-nacks, and, according\r\nto her daily custom, to make her little drawing-room the garland of\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s Place.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox endued herself with a pair of ancient gloves, like dead\r\nleaves, in which she was accustomed to perform these avocations\xe2\x80\x94hidden\r\nfrom human sight at other times in a table drawer\xe2\x80\x94and went methodically\r\nto work; beginning with the bird waltz; passing, by a natural\r\nassociation of ideas, to her bird\xe2\x80\x94a very high-shouldered canary,\r\nstricken in years, and much rumpled, but a piercing singer, as\r\nPrincess\xe2\x80\x99s Place well knew; taking, next in order, the little china\r\nornaments, paper fly-cages, and so forth; and coming round, in good\r\ntime, to the plants, which generally required to be snipped here and\r\nthere with a pair of scissors, for some botanical reason that was very\r\npowerful with Miss Tox.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox was slow in coming to the plants, this morning. The weather\r\nwas warm, the wind southerly; and there was a sigh of the summer-time\r\nin Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, that turned Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts upon the country.\r\nThe pot-boy attached to the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Arms had come out with a can and\r\ntrickled water, in a flowering pattern, all over Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, and\r\nit gave the weedy ground a fresh scent\xe2\x80\x94quite a growing scent, Miss Tox\r\nsaid. There was a tiny blink of sun peeping in from the great street\r\nround the corner, and the smoky sparrows hopped over it and back again,\r\nbrightening as they passed: or bathed in it, like a stream, and became\r\nglorified sparrows, unconnected with chimneys. Legends in praise of\r\nGinger-Beer, with pictorial representations of thirsty customers\r\nsubmerged in the effervescence, or stunned by the flying corks, were\r\nconspicuous in the window of the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Arms. They were making late\r\nhay, somewhere out of town; and though the fragrance had a long way to\r\ncome, and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings\r\nof the poor (may God reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the\r\nPlague as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors, and who do\r\ntheir little best to keep those dwellings miserable!), yet it was\r\nwafted faintly into Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, whispering of Nature and her\r\nwholesome air, as such things will, even unto prisoners and captives,\r\nand those who are desolate and oppressed, in very spite of aldermen and\r\nknights to boot: at whose sage nod\xe2\x80\x94and how they nod!\xe2\x80\x94the rolling world\r\nstands still!\r\n\r\nMiss Tox sat down upon the window-seat, and thought of her good Papa\r\ndeceased\xe2\x80\x94Mr Tox, of the Customs Department of the public service; and\r\nof her childhood, passed at a seaport, among a considerable quantity of\r\ncold tar, and some rusticity. She fell into a softened remembrance of\r\nmeadows, in old time, gleaming with buttercups, like so many inverted\r\nfirmaments of golden stars; and how she had made chains of\r\ndandelion-stalks for youthful vowers of eternal constancy, dressed\r\nchiefly in nankeen; and how soon those fetters had withered and broken.\r\n\r\nSitting on the window-seat, and looking out upon the sparrows and the\r\nblink of sun, Miss Tox thought likewise of her good Mama\r\ndeceased\xe2\x80\x94sister to the owner of the powdered head and pigtail\xe2\x80\x94of her\r\nvirtues and her rheumatism. And when a man with bulgy legs, and a rough\r\nvoice, and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere\r\nblack muffin, came crying flowers down Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, making his\r\ntimid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he\r\ngave, as though he had been an ogre, hawking little children, summer\r\nrecollections were so strong upon Miss Tox, that she shook her head,\r\nand murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew it\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nseemed likely.\r\n\r\nIn her pensive mood, Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts went wandering on Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrack; probably because the Major had returned home to his lodgings\r\nopposite, and had just bowed to her from his window. What other reason\r\ncould Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and\r\ndandelion fetters? Was he more cheerful? thought Miss Tox. Was he\r\nreconciled to the decrees of fate? Would he ever marry again? and if\r\nyes, whom? What sort of person now!\r\n\r\nA flush\xe2\x80\x94it was warm weather\xe2\x80\x94overspread Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s face, as, while\r\nentertaining these meditations, she turned her head, and was surprised\r\nby the reflection of her thoughtful image in the chimney-glass. Another\r\nflush succeeded when she saw a little carriage drive into Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace, and make straight for her own door. Miss Tox arose, took up her\r\nscissors hastily, and so coming, at last, to the plants, was very busy\r\nwith them when Mrs Chick entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is my sweetest friend!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Tox, with open arms.\r\n\r\nA little stateliness was mingled with Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s sweetest friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndemeanour, but she kissed Miss Tox, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLucretia, thank you, I\r\nam pretty well. I hope you are the same. Hem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick was labouring under a peculiar little monosyllabic cough; a\r\nsort of primer, or easy introduction to the art of coughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou call very early, and how kind that is, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Miss Tox.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, have you breakfasted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Lucretia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have. I took an early\r\nbreakfast\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the good lady seemed curious on the subject of Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace, and looked all round it as she spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith my brother, who has\r\ncome home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better, I trust, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is greatly better, thank you. Hem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa must be careful of that cough\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s merely change of weather. We\r\nmust expect change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf weather?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Tox, in her simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf everything,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we must. It\xe2\x80\x99s a world\r\nof change. Anyone would surprise me very much, Lucretia, and would\r\ngreatly alter my opinion of their understanding, if they attempted to\r\ncontradict or evade what is so perfectly evident. Change!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMrs Chick, with severe philosophy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my gracious me, what is there\r\nthat does _not_ change! even the silkworm, who I am sure might be\r\nsupposed not to trouble itself about such subjects, changes into all\r\nsorts of unexpected things continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mild Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cis ever happy in her\r\nillustrations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so kind, Lucretia,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick, a little softened, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nto say so, and to think so, I believe. I hope neither of us may ever\r\nhave any cause to lessen our opinion of the other, Lucretia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick coughed as before, and drew lines on the carpet with the\r\nivory end of her parasol. Miss Tox, who had experience of her fair\r\nfriend, and knew that under the pressure of any slight fatigue or\r\nvexation she was prone to a discursive kind of irritability, availed\r\nherself of the pause, to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, my dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cbut have I caught sight of\r\nthe manly form of Mr Chick in the carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cbut pray leave him there. He has his\r\nnewspaper, and would be quite contented for the next two hours. Go on\r\nwith your flowers, Lucretia, and allow me to sit here and rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Louisa knows,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cthat between friends like\r\nourselves, any approach to ceremony would be out of the question.\r\nTherefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore Miss Tox finished the sentence, not in words but\r\naction; and putting on her gloves again, which she had taken off, and\r\narming herself once more with her scissors, began to snip and clip\r\namong the leaves with microscopic industry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence has returned home also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after sitting silent\r\nfor some time, with her head on one side, and her parasol sketching on\r\nthe floor; \xe2\x80\x9cand really Florence is a great deal too old now, to\r\ncontinue to lead that solitary life to which she has been accustomed.\r\nOf course she is. There can be no doubt about it. I should have very\r\nlittle respect, indeed, for anybody who could advocate a different\r\nopinion. Whatever my wishes might be, I could not respect them. We\r\ncannot command our feelings to such an extent as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox assented, without being particular as to the intelligibility\r\nof the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s a strange girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cand if my brother Paul\r\ncannot feel perfectly comfortable in her society, after all the sad\r\nthings that have happened, and all the terrible disappointments that\r\nhave been undergone, then, what is the reply? That he must make an\r\neffort. That he is bound to make an effort. We have always been a\r\nfamily remarkable for effort. Paul is at the head of the family; almost\r\nthe only representative of it left\xe2\x80\x94for what am I\xe2\x80\x94I am of no\r\nconsequence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest love,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Miss Tox.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick dried her eyes, which were, for the moment, overflowing; and\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd consequently he is more than ever bound to make an effort. And\r\nthough his having done so, comes upon me with a sort of shock\xe2\x80\x94for mine\r\nis a very weak and foolish nature; which is anything but a blessing I\r\nam sure; I often wish my heart was a marble slab, or a paving-stone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweet Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Miss Tox again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself,\r\nand to his name of Dombey; although, of course, I always knew he would\r\nbe. I only hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she may be\r\nworthy of the name too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox filled a little green watering-pot from a jug, and happening\r\nto look up when she had done so, was so surprised by the amount of\r\nexpression Mrs Chick had conveyed into her face, and was bestowing upon\r\nher, that she put the little watering-pot on the table for the present,\r\nand sat down near it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cwill it be the least satisfaction to\r\nyou, if I venture to observe in reference to that remark, that I, as a\r\nhumble individual, think your sweet niece in every way most promising?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Lucretia?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Chick, with increased\r\nstateliness of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cTo what remark of mine, my dear, do you refer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer being worthy of her name, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with solemn patience, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not expressed\r\nmyself with clearness, Lucretia, the fault of course is mine. There is,\r\nperhaps, no reason why I should express myself at all, except the\r\nintimacy that has subsisted between us, and which I very much hope,\r\nLucretia\xe2\x80\x94confidently hope\xe2\x80\x94nothing will occur to disturb. Because, why\r\nshould I do anything else? There is no reason; it would be absurd. But\r\nI wish to express myself clearly, Lucretia; and therefore to go back to\r\nthat remark, I must beg to say that it was not intended to relate to\r\nFlorence, in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick shortly and decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her meek friend; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot have\r\nunderstood it. I fear I am dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick looked round the room and over the way; at the plants, at the\r\nbird, at the watering-pot, at almost everything within view, except\r\nMiss Tox; and finally dropping her glance upon Miss Tox, for a moment,\r\non its way to the ground, said, looking meanwhile with elevated\r\neyebrows at the carpet:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I speak, Lucretia, of her being worthy of the name, I speak of my\r\nbrother Paul\xe2\x80\x99s second wife. I believe I have already said, in effect,\r\nif not in the very words I now use, that it is his intention to marry a\r\nsecond wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox left her seat in a hurry, and returned to her plants; clipping\r\namong the stems and leaves, with as little favour as a barber working\r\nat so many pauper heads of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether she will be fully sensible of the distinction conferred upon\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, in a lofty tone, \xe2\x80\x9cis quite another question. I\r\nhope she may be. We are bound to think well of one another in this\r\nworld, and I hope she may be. I have not been advised with myself. If I\r\nhad been advised with, I have no doubt my advice would have been\r\ncavalierly received, and therefore it is infinitely better as it is. I\r\nmuch prefer it as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, with head bent down, still clipped among the plants. Mrs\r\nChick, with energetic shakings of her own head from time to time,\r\ncontinued to hold forth, as if in defiance of somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my brother Paul had consulted with me, which he sometimes does\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather, sometimes used to do; for he will naturally do that no more\r\nnow, and this is a circumstance which I regard as a relief from\r\nresponsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, hysterically, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I thank Heaven I am\r\nnot jealous\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here Mrs Chick again shed tears: \xe2\x80\x9cif my brother Paul had\r\ncome to me, and had said, \xe2\x80\x98Louisa, what kind of qualities would you\r\nadvise me to look out for, in a wife?\xe2\x80\x99 I should certainly have\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x98Paul, you must have family, you must have beauty, you must\r\nhave dignity, you must have connexion.\xe2\x80\x99 Those are the words I should\r\nhave used. You might have led me to the block immediately afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Chick, as if that consequence were highly probable, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nshould have used them. I should have said, \xe2\x80\x98Paul! You to marry a second\r\ntime without family! You to marry without beauty! You to marry without\r\ndignity! You to marry without connexion! There is nobody in the world,\r\nnot mad, who could dream of daring to entertain such a preposterous\r\nidea!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox stopped clipping; and with her head among the plants, listened\r\nattentively. Perhaps Miss Tox thought there was hope in this exordium,\r\nand the warmth of Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have adopted this course of argument,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the discreet\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I trust I am not a fool. I make no claim to be\r\nconsidered a person of superior intellect\xe2\x80\x94though I believe some people\r\nhave been extraordinary enough to consider me so; one so little\r\nhumoured as I am, would very soon be disabused of any such notion; but\r\nI trust I am not a downright fool. And to tell ME,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick with\r\nineffable disdain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my brother Paul Dombey could ever contemplate\r\nthe possibility of uniting himself to anybody\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nmore sharp and emphatic in that short clause than in any other part of\r\nher discourse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot possessing these requisites, would be to insult what\r\nunderstanding I have got, as much as if I was to be told that I was\r\nborn and bred an elephant, which I may be told next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick,\r\nwith resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me at all. I expect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence that ensued, Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s scissors gave a feeble\r\nclip or two; but Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s face was still invisible, and Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorning gown was agitated. Mrs Chick looked sideways at her, through\r\nthe intervening plants, and went on to say, in a tone of bland\r\nconviction, and as one dwelling on a point of fact that hardly required\r\nto be stated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, of course my brother Paul has done what was to be expected\r\nof him, and what anybody might have foreseen he would do, if he entered\r\nthe marriage state again. I confess it takes me rather by surprise,\r\nhowever gratifying; because when Paul went out of town I had no idea at\r\nall that he would form any attachment out of town, and he certainly had\r\nno attachment when he left here. However, it seems to be extremely\r\ndesirable in every point of view. I have no doubt the mother is a most\r\ngenteel and elegant creature, and I have no right whatever to dispute\r\nthe policy of her living with them: which is Paul\xe2\x80\x99s affair, not\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94and as to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s choice, herself, I have only seen her picture\r\nyet, but that is beautiful indeed. Her name is beautiful too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nChick, shaking her head with energy, and arranging herself in her\r\nchair; \xe2\x80\x9cEdith is at once uncommon, as it strikes me, and distinguished.\r\nConsequently, Lucretia, I have no doubt you will be happy to hear that\r\nthe marriage is to take place immediately\xe2\x80\x94of course, you will:\xe2\x80\x9d great\r\nemphasis again: \xe2\x80\x9cand that you are delighted with this change in the\r\ncondition of my brother, who has shown you a great deal of pleasant\r\nattention at various times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox made no verbal answer, but took up the little watering-pot\r\nwith a trembling hand, and looked vacantly round as if considering what\r\narticle of furniture would be improved by the contents. The room door\r\nopening at this crisis of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, she started, laughed\r\naloud, and fell into the arms of the person entering; happily\r\ninsensible alike of Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x99s indignant countenance and of the Major\r\nat his window over the way, who had his double-barrelled eye-glass in\r\nfull action, and whose face and figure were dilated with\r\nMephistophelean joy.\r\n\r\nNot so the expatriated Native, amazed supporter of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s swooning\r\nform, who, coming straight upstairs, with a polite inquiry touching\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s health (in exact pursuance of the Major\xe2\x80\x99s malicious\r\ninstructions), had accidentally arrived in the very nick of time to\r\ncatch the delicate burden in his arms, and to receive the contents of\r\nthe little watering-pot in his shoe; both of which circumstances,\r\ncoupled with his consciousness of being closely watched by the wrathful\r\nMajor, who had threatened the usual penalty in regard of every bone in\r\nhis skin in case of any failure, combined to render him a moving\r\nspectacle of mental and bodily distress.\r\n\r\nFor some moments, this afflicted foreigner remained clasping Miss Tox\r\nto his heart, with an energy of action in remarkable opposition to his\r\ndisconcerted face, while that poor lady trickled slowly down upon him\r\nthe very last sprinklings of the little watering-pot, as if he were a\r\ndelicate exotic (which indeed he was), and might be almost expected to\r\nblow while the gentle rain descended. Mrs Chick, at length recovering\r\nsufficient presence of mind to interpose, commanded him to drop Miss\r\nTox upon the sofa and withdraw; and the exile promptly obeying, she\r\napplied herself to promote Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.\r\n\r\nBut none of that gentle concern which usually characterises the\r\ndaughters of Eve in their tending of each other; none of that\r\nfreemasonry in fainting, by which they are generally bound together in\r\na mysterious bond of sisterhood; was visible in Mrs Chick\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour.\r\nRather like the executioner who restores the victim to sensation\r\nprevious to proceeding with the torture (or was wont to do so, in the\r\ngood old times for which all true men wear perpetual mourning), did Mrs\r\nChick administer the smelling-bottle, the slapping on the hands, the\r\ndashing of cold water on the face, and the other proved remedies. And\r\nwhen, at length, Miss Tox opened her eyes, and gradually became\r\nrestored to animation and consciousness, Mrs Chick drew off as from a\r\ncriminal, and reversing the precedent of the murdered king of Denmark,\r\nregarded her more in anger than in sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucretia!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick \xe2\x80\x9cI will not attempt to disguise what I feel.\r\nMy eyes are opened, all at once. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed this, if a\r\nSaint had told it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am foolish to give way to faintness,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Tox faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nbetter presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be better presently, Lucretia!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Chick, with\r\nexceeding scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I am blind? Do you imagine I am in my\r\nsecond childhood? No, Lucretia! I am obliged to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox directed an imploring, helpless kind of look towards her\r\nfriend, and put her handkerchief before her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone had told me this yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with majesty,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor even half-an-hour ago, I should have been tempted, I almost\r\nbelieve, to strike them to the earth. Lucretia Tox, my eyes are opened\r\nto you all at once. The scales:\xe2\x80\x9d here Mrs Chick cast down an imaginary\r\npair, such as are commonly used in grocers\xe2\x80\x9d shops: \xe2\x80\x9chave fallen from my\r\nsight. The blindness of my confidence is past, Lucretia. It has been\r\nabused and played, upon, and evasion is quite out of the question now,\r\nI assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! to what do you allude so cruelly, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Tox,\r\nthrough her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucretia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cask your own heart. I must entreat you not\r\nto address me by any such familiar term as you have just used, if you\r\nplease. I have some self-respect left, though you may think otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Louisa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you speak to me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I speak to you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick, who, in default\r\nof having any particular argument to sustain herself upon, relied\r\nprincipally on such repetitions for her most withering effects. \xe2\x80\x9cLike\r\nthat! You may well say like that, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox sobbed pitifully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cof your having basked at my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfireside, like a serpent, and wound yourself, through me, almost into\r\nhis confidence, Lucretia, that you might, in secret, entertain designs\r\nupon him, and dare to aspire to contemplate the possibility of his\r\nuniting himself to you! Why, it is an idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with\r\nsarcastic dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cthe absurdity of which almost relieves its\r\ntreachery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not say such dreadful things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful things!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Chick. \xe2\x80\x9cDreadful things! Is it not a\r\nfact, Lucretia, that you have just now been unable to command your\r\nfeelings even before me, whose eyes you had so completely closed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made no complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said nothing. If I\r\nhave been a little overpowered by your news, Louisa, and have ever had\r\nany lingering thought that Mr Dombey was inclined to be particular\r\ntowards me, surely you will not condemn me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, addressing herself to the whole\r\nof the furniture, in a comprehensive glance of resignation and appeal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going to say\xe2\x80\x94I know it\xe2\x80\x94that I have encouraged her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to exchange reproaches, dear Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Miss Tox.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I wish to complain. But, in my own defence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Chick, looking round the room with a prophetic smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99s going to say. I knew it. You had better say it. Say\r\nit openly! Be open, Lucretia Tox,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with desperate\r\nsternness, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my own defence,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cand only in my own defence\r\nagainst your unkind words, my dear Louisa, I would merely ask you if\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t often favoured such a fancy, and even said it might happen,\r\nfor anything we could tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, rising, not as if she were going to\r\nstop at the floor, but as if she were about to soar up, high, into her\r\nnative skies, \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond which endurance becomes ridiculous, if not\r\nculpable. I can bear much; but not too much. What spell was on me when\r\nI came into this house this day, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I had a\r\npresentiment\xe2\x80\x94a dark presentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, with a shiver, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nsomething was going to happen. Well may I have had that foreboding,\r\nLucretia, when my confidence of many years is destroyed in an instant,\r\nwhen my eyes are opened all at once, and when I find you revealed in\r\nyour true colours. Lucretia, I have been mistaken in you. It is better\r\nfor us both that this subject should end here. I wish you well, and I\r\nshall ever wish you well. But, as an individual who desires to be true\r\nto herself in her own poor position, whatever that position may be, or\r\nmay not be\xe2\x80\x94and as the sister of my brother\xe2\x80\x94and as the sister-in-law of\r\nmy brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94and as a connexion by marriage of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94may I be permitted to add, as a Dombey?\xe2\x80\x94I can wish you nothing\r\nelse but good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, delivered with cutting suavity, tempered and chastened by\r\na lofty air of moral rectitude, carried the speaker to the door. There\r\nshe inclined her head in a ghostly and statue-like manner, and so\r\nwithdrew to her carriage, to seek comfort and consolation in the arms\r\nof Mr Chick, her lord.\r\n\r\nFiguratively speaking, that is to say; for the arms of Mr Chick were\r\nfull of his newspaper. Neither did that gentleman address his eyes\r\ntowards his wife otherwise than by stealth. Neither did he offer any\r\nconsolation whatever. In short, he sat reading, and humming fag ends of\r\ntunes, and sometimes glancing furtively at her without delivering\r\nhimself of a word, good, bad, or indifferent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mrs Chick sat swelling and bridling, and tossing her\r\nhead, as if she were still repeating that solemn formula of farewell to\r\nLucretia Tox. At length, she said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cOh the extent to which her\r\neyes had been opened that day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo which your eyes have been opened, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chic \xe2\x80\x9cif you can bear to see me in\r\nthis state, and not ask me what the matter is, you had better hold your\r\ntongue for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Chick\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, in a state of soliloquy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she should\r\never have conceived the base idea of connecting herself with our family\r\nby a marriage with Paul! To think that when she was playing at horses\r\nwith that dear child who is now in his grave\xe2\x80\x94I never liked it at the\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94she should have been hiding such a double-faced design! I wonder\r\nshe was never afraid that something would happen to her. She is\r\nfortunate if nothing does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really thought, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick slowly, after rubbing the\r\nbridge of his nose for some time with his newspaper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had gone\r\non the same tack yourself, all along, until this morning; and had\r\nthought it would be a convenient thing enough, if it could have been\r\nbrought about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick instantly burst into tears, and told Mr Chick that if he\r\nwished to trample upon her with his boots, he had better do It.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with Lucretia Tox I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, after abandoning\r\nherself to her feelings for some minutes, to Mr Chick\xe2\x80\x99s great terror.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear to resign Paul\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in favour of one who, I hope\r\nand trust, may be deserving of it, and with whom he has a perfect right\r\nto replace poor Fanny if he chooses; I can bear to be informed, in\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s cool manner, of such a change in his plans, and never to be\r\nconsulted until all is settled and determined; but deceit I can not\r\nbear, and with Lucretia Tox I have done. It is better as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Chick, piously; \xe2\x80\x9cmuch better. It would have been a long time before\r\nI could have accommodated myself comfortably with her, after this; and\r\nI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know, as Paul is going to be very grand, and these are\r\npeople of condition, that she would have been quite presentable, and\r\nmight not have compromised myself. There\xe2\x80\x99s a providence in everything;\r\neverything works for the best; I have been tried today but on the whole\r\nI do not regret it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn which Christian spirit, Mrs Chick dried her eyes and smoothed her\r\nlap, and sat as became a person calm under a great wrong. Mr Chick\r\nfeeling his unworthiness no doubt, took an early opportunity of being\r\nset down at a street corner and walking away whistling, with his\r\nshoulders very much raised, and his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\nWhile poor excommunicated Miss Tox, who, if she were a fawner and\r\ntoad-eater, was at least an honest and a constant one, and had ever\r\nborne a faithful friendship towards her impeacher and had been truly\r\nabsorbed and swallowed up in devotion to the magnificence of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x94while poor excommunicated Miss Tox watered her plants with her\r\ntears, and felt that it was winter in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nThe interval before the Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the enchanted house was no more, and the working world had\r\nbroken into it, and was hammering and crashing and tramping up and down\r\nstairs all day long keeping Diogenes in an incessant paroxysm of\r\nbarking, from sunrise to sunset\xe2\x80\x94evidently convinced that his enemy had\r\ngot the better of him at last, and was then sacking the premises in\r\ntriumphant defiance\xe2\x80\x94there was, at first, no other great change in the\r\nmethod of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s life. At night, when the workpeople went away, the\r\nhouse was dreary and deserted again; and Florence, listening to their\r\nvoices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed,\r\npictured to herself the cheerful homes to which they were returning,\r\nand the children who were waiting for them, and was glad to think that\r\nthey were merry and well pleased to go.\r\n\r\nShe welcomed back the evening silence as an old friend, but it came now\r\nwith an altered face, and looked more kindly on her. Fresh hope was in\r\nit. The beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her, in the very\r\nroom in which her heart had been so wrung, was a spirit of promise to\r\nher. Soft shadows of the bright life dawning, when her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffection should be gradually won, and all, or much should be restored,\r\nof what she had lost on the dark day when a mother\xe2\x80\x99s love had faded\r\nwith a mother\xe2\x80\x99s last breath on her cheek, moved about her in the\r\ntwilight and were welcome company. Peeping at the rosy children her\r\nneighbours, it was a new and precious sensation to think that they\r\nmight soon speak together and know each other; when she would not fear,\r\nas of old, to show herself before them, lest they should be grieved to\r\nsee her in her black dress sitting there alone!\r\n\r\nIn her thoughts of her new mother, and in the love and trust\r\noverflowing her pure heart towards her, Florence loved her own dead\r\nmother more and more. She had no fear of setting up a rival in her\r\nbreast. The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished\r\nroot, she knew. Every gentle word that had fallen from the lips of the\r\nbeautiful lady, sounded to Florence like an echo of the voice long\r\nhushed and silent. How could she love that memory less for living\r\ntenderness, when it was her memory of all parental tenderness and love!\r\n\r\nFlorence was, one day, sitting reading in her room, and thinking of the\r\nlady and her promised visit soon\xe2\x80\x94for her book turned on a kindred\r\nsubject\xe2\x80\x94when, raising her eyes, she saw her standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, joyfully meeting her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Mama yet,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady, with a serious smile, as she\r\nencircled Florence\xe2\x80\x99s neck with her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut very soon to be,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon now, Florence: very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith bent her head a little, so as to press the blooming cheek of\r\nFlorence against her own, and for some few moments remained thus\r\nsilent. There was something so very tender in her manner, that Florence\r\nwas even more sensible of it than on the first occasion of their\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nShe led Florence to a chair beside her, and sat down: Florence looking\r\nin her face, quite wondering at its beauty, and willingly leaving her\r\nhand in hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been alone, Florence, since I was here last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Florence, hastily.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and cast down her eyes; for her new Mama was very earnest\r\nin her look, and the look was intently and thoughtfully fixed upon her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94am used to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it at all. Di\r\nand I pass whole days together, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Florence might have said,\r\nwhole weeks and months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Di your maid, love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dog, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cSusan is my maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these are your rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not shown\r\nthese rooms the other day. We must have them improved, Florence. They\r\nshall be made the prettiest in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I might change them, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one\r\nupstairs I should like much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this not high enough, dear girl?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edith, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other was my brother\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very fond\r\nof it. I would have spoken to Papa about it when I came home, and found\r\nthe workmen here, and everything changing; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence dropped her eyes, lest the same look should make her falter\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I was afraid it might distress him; and as you said you would be\r\nhere again soon, Mama, and are the mistress of everything, I determined\r\nto take courage and ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith sat looking at her, with her brilliant eyes intent upon her face,\r\nuntil Florence raising her own, she, in her turn, withdrew her gaze,\r\nand turned it on the ground. It was then that Florence thought how\r\ndifferent this lady\xe2\x80\x99s beauty was, from what she had supposed. She had\r\nthought it of a proud and lofty kind; yet her manner was so subdued and\r\ngentle, that if she had been of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s own age and character, it\r\nscarcely could have invited confidence more.\r\n\r\nExcept when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her; and then\r\nshe seemed (but Florence hardly understood this, though she could not\r\nchoose but notice it, and think about it) as if she were humbled before\r\nFlorence, and ill at ease. When she had said that she was not her Mama\r\nyet, and when Florence had called her the mistress of everything there,\r\nthis change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of\r\nFlorence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk\r\nand hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her,\r\nin right of such a near connexion.\r\n\r\nShe gave Florence her ready promise, about her new room, and said she\r\nwould give directions about it herself. She then asked some questions\r\nconcerning poor Paul; and when they had sat in conversation for some\r\ntime, told Florence she had come to take her to her own home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have come to London now, my mother and I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nshall stay with us until I am married. I wish that we should know and\r\ntrust each other, Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cdear Mama. How much I thank\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me say now, for it may be the best opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Edith,\r\nlooking round to see that they were quite alone, and speaking in a\r\nlower voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when I am married, and have gone away for some\r\nweeks, I shall be easier at heart if you will come home here. No matter\r\nwho invites you to stay elsewhere. Come home here. It is better to be\r\nalone than\xe2\x80\x94what I would say is,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, checking herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nknow well you are best at home, dear Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will come home on the very day, Mama\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo so. I rely on that promise. Now, prepare to come with me, dear\r\ngirl. You will find me downstairs when you are ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly and thoughtfully did Edith wander alone through the mansion of\r\nwhich she was so soon to be the lady: and little heed took she of all\r\nthe elegance and splendour it began to display. The same indomitable\r\nhaughtiness of soul, the same proud scorn expressed in eye and lip, the\r\nsame fierce beauty, only tamed by a sense of its own little worth, and\r\nof the little worth of everything around it, went through the grand\r\nsaloons and halls, that had got loose among the shady trees, and raged\r\nand rent themselves. The mimic roses on the walls and floors were set\r\nround with sharp thorns, that tore her breast; in every scrap of gold\r\nso dazzling to the eye, she saw some hateful atom of her\r\npurchase-money; the broad high mirrors showed her, at full length, a\r\nwoman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature, who was too\r\nfalse to her better self, and too debased and lost, to save herself.\r\nShe believed that all this was so plain, more or less, to all eyes,\r\nthat she had no resource or power of self-assertion but in pride: and\r\nwith this pride, which tortured her own heart night and day, she fought\r\nher fate out, braved it, and defied it.\r\n\r\nWas this the woman whom Florence\xe2\x80\x94an innocent girl, strong only in her\r\nearnestness and simple truth\xe2\x80\x94could so impress and quell, that by her\r\nside she was another creature, with her tempest of passion hushed, and\r\nher very pride itself subdued? Was this the woman who now sat beside\r\nher in a carriage, with her arms entwined, and who, while she courted\r\nand entreated her to love and trust her, drew her fair head to nestle\r\non her breast, and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or\r\nharm?\r\n\r\nOh, Edith! it were well to die, indeed, at such a time! Better and\r\nhappier far, perhaps, to die so, Edith, than to live on to the end!\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Mrs Skewton, who was thinking of anything rather than of\r\nsuch sentiments\xe2\x80\x94for, like many genteel persons who have existed at\r\nvarious times, she set her face against death altogether, and objected\r\nto the mention of any such low and levelling upstart\xe2\x80\x94had borrowed a\r\nhouse in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, from a stately relative (one\r\nof the Feenix brood), who was out of town, and who did not object to\r\nlending it, in the handsomest manner, for nuptial purposes, as the loan\r\nimplied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and\r\ngifts to Mrs Skewton and her daughter. It being necessary for the\r\ncredit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, Mrs\r\nSkewton, with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident in\r\nthe parish of Mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the\r\nnobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen,\r\nclapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra\r\non that account, as having the appearance of an ancient family\r\nretainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of\r\nkitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that Withers the\r\npage, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the\r\npropulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had\r\nbeen several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if\r\nhe misdoubted his having overslept himself at the Leamington milkman\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand being still in a celestial dream. A variety of requisites in plate\r\nand china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same\r\nconvenient source, with several miscellaneous articles, including a\r\nneat chariot and a pair of bays, Mrs Skewton cushioned herself on the\r\nprincipal sofa, in the Cleopatra attitude, and held her court in fair\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, on the entrance of her daughter and her\r\ncharge, \xe2\x80\x9cis my charming Florence? You must come and kiss me, Florence,\r\nif you please, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence was timidly stooping to pick out a place in the white part of\r\nMrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s face, when that lady presented her ear, and relieved her\r\nof her difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cpositively, I\xe2\x80\x94stand a little more\r\nin the light, my sweetest Florence, for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence blushingly complied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, dearest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you were\r\nwhen you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious Florence,\r\nor a few years younger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long forgotten, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor positively, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cI do think that I see a\r\ndecided resemblance to what you were then, in our extremely fascinating\r\nyoung friend. And it shows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, in a lower voice, which\r\nconveyed her opinion that Florence was in a very unfinished state,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat cultivation will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d was Edith\xe2\x80\x99s stern reply.\r\n\r\nHer mother eyed her sharply for a moment, and feeling herself on unsafe\r\nground, said, as a diversion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy charming Florence, you must come and kiss me once more, if you\r\nplease, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence complied, of course, and again imprinted her lips on Mrs\r\nSkewton\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have heard, no doubt, my darling pet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton,\r\ndetaining her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your Papa, whom we all perfectly adore and\r\ndote upon, is to be married to my dearest Edith this day week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would be very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not exactly\r\nwhen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d urged her mother, gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible you have\r\nnot told Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I tell Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, so suddenly and harshly,\r\nthat Florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton then told Florence, as another and safer diversion, that\r\nher father was coming to dinner, and that he would no doubt be\r\ncharmingly surprised to see her; as he had spoken last night of\r\ndressing in the City, and had known nothing of Edith\xe2\x80\x99s design, the\r\nexecution of which, according to Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s expectation, would throw\r\nhim into a perfect ecstasy. Florence was troubled to hear this; and her\r\ndistress became so keen, as the dinner-hour approached, that if she had\r\nknown how to frame an entreaty to be suffered to return home, without\r\ninvolving her father in her explanation, she would have hurried back on\r\nfoot, bareheaded, breathless, and alone, rather than incur the risk of\r\nmeeting his displeasure.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew nearer, she could hardly breathe. She dared not\r\napproach a window, lest he should see her from the street. She dared\r\nnot go upstairs to hide her emotion, lest, in passing out at the door,\r\nshe should meet him unexpectedly; besides which dread, she felt as\r\nthough she never could come back again if she were summoned to his\r\npresence. In this conflict of fears; she was sitting by Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncouch, endeavouring to understand and to reply to the bald discourse of\r\nthat lady, when she heard his foot upon the stair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear him now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, starting. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra, who in her juvenility was always playfully disposed, and who\r\nin her self-engrossment did not trouble herself about the nature of\r\nthis agitation, pushed Florence behind her couch, and dropped a shawl\r\nover her, preparatory to giving Mr Dombey a rapture of surprise. It was\r\nso quickly done, that in a moment Florence heard his awful step in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe saluted his intended mother-in-law, and his intended bride. The\r\nstrange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here and tell me how your\r\npretty Florence is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence is very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, advancing towards the couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cleopatra, with bewitching vivacity; \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nare you sure you are not deceiving me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what my dearest\r\nEdith will say to me when I make such a declaration, but upon my honour\r\nI am afraid you are the falsest of men, my dear Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough he had been; and had been detected on the spot, in the most\r\nenormous falsehood that was ever said or done; he could hardly have\r\nbeen more disconcerted than he was, when Mrs Skewton plucked the shawl\r\naway, and Florence, pale and trembling, rose before him like a ghost.\r\nHe had not yet recovered his presence of mind, when Florence had run up\r\nto him, clasped her hands round his neck, kissed his face, and hurried\r\nout of the room. He looked round as if to refer the matter to somebody\r\nelse, but Edith had gone after Florence, instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, confess, my dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, giving him her hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you never were more surprised and pleased in your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was more surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor pleased, my dearest Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Skewton, holding up her\r\nfan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94yes, I am exceedingly glad to meet Florence here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\nHe appeared to consider gravely about it for a moment, and then said,\r\nmore decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I really am very glad indeed to meet Florence\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wonder how she comes here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! wicked guesser!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cleopatra, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\ncunning, cunning man! One shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell these things; your sex, my\r\ndear Dombey, are so vain, and so apt to abuse our weakness; but you\r\nknow my open soul\xe2\x80\x94very well; immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Edith, my dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she\r\ncannot have you near her\xe2\x80\x94and as I tell her, she cannot expect that\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94will at least have near her something or somebody belonging to\r\nyou. Well, how extremely natural that is! And in this spirit, nothing\r\nwould keep her from riding off today to fetch our darling Florence.\r\nWell, how excessively charming that is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she waited for an answer, Mr Dombey answered, \xe2\x80\x9cEminently so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, my dear Dombey, for that proof of heart!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cleopatra,\r\nsqueezing his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am growing too serious! Take me downstairs,\r\nlike an angel, and let us see what these people intend to give us for\r\ndinner. Bless you, dear Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra skipping off her couch with tolerable briskness, after the\r\nlast benediction, Mr Dombey took her arm in his and led her\r\nceremoniously downstairs; one of the very tall young men on hire, whose\r\norgan of veneration was imperfectly developed, thrusting his tongue\r\ninto his cheek, for the entertainment of the other very tall young man\r\non hire, as the couple turned into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nFlorence and Edith were already there, and sitting side by side.\r\nFlorence would have risen when her father entered, to resign her chair\r\nto him; but Edith openly put her hand upon her arm, and Mr Dombey took\r\nan opposite place at the round table.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was almost entirely sustained by Mrs Skewton. Florence\r\nhardly dared to raise her eyes, lest they should reveal the traces of\r\ntears; far less dared to speak; and Edith never uttered one word,\r\nunless in answer to a question. Verily, Cleopatra worked hard, for the\r\nestablishment that was so nearly clutched; and verily it should have\r\nbeen a rich one to reward her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so your preparations are nearly finished at last, my dear Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Cleopatra, when the dessert was put upon the table, and the\r\nsilver-headed butler had withdrawn. \xe2\x80\x9cEven the lawyers\xe2\x80\x9d preparations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey; \xe2\x80\x9cthe deed of settlement, the\r\nprofessional gentlemen inform me, is now ready, and as I was mentioning\r\nto you, Edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her own time for\r\nits execution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith sat like a handsome statue; as cold, as silent, and as still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you hear what Mr Dombey says?\r\nAh, my dear Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d aside to that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9chow her absence, as the\r\ntime approaches, reminds me of the days, when that most agreeable of\r\ncreatures, her Papa, was in your situation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to suggest. It shall be when you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith,\r\nscarcely looking over the table at Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr would next day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9csuit your engagements better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no engagements. I am always at your disposal. Let it be when\r\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo engagements, my dear Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are\r\nin a most terrible state of flurry all day long, and have a thousand\r\nand one appointments with all sorts of trades-people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are of your making,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edith, turning on her with a slight\r\ncontraction of her brow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and Mr Dombey can arrange between you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true indeed, my love, and most considerate of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling Florence, you must really come and kiss me once\r\nmore, if you please, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSingular coincidence, that these gushes of interest in Florence hurried\r\nCleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which Edith had a share,\r\nhowever trifling! Florence had certainly never undergone so much\r\nembracing, and perhaps had never been, unconsciously, so useful in her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was far from quarrelling, in his own breast, with the manner\r\nof his beautiful betrothed. He had that good reason for sympathy with\r\nhaughtiness and coldness, which is found in a fellow-feeling. It\r\nflattered him to think how these deferred to him, in Edith\xe2\x80\x99s case, and\r\nseemed to have no will apart from his. It flattered him to picture to\r\nhimself, this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house,\r\nand chilling his guests after his own manner. The dignity of Dombey and\r\nSon would be heightened and maintained, indeed, in such hands.\r\n\r\nSo thought Mr Dombey, when he was left alone at the dining-table, and\r\nmused upon his past and future fortunes: finding no uncongeniality in\r\nan air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room, in colour a\r\ndark brown, with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls, and\r\ntwenty-four black chairs, with almost as many nails in them as so many\r\ncoffins, waiting like mutes, upon the threshold of the Turkey carpet;\r\nand two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of\r\ncandelabra on the sideboard, and a musty smell prevailing as if the\r\nashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below\r\nit. The owner of the house lived much abroad; the air of England seldom\r\nagreed long with a member of the Feenix family; and the room had\r\ngradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him,\r\nuntil it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to\r\nbe quite complete.\r\n\r\nNo bad representation of the body, for the nonce, in his unbending\r\nform, if not in his attitude, Mr Dombey looked down into the cold\r\ndepths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and\r\ndecanters lay at anchor: as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising\r\ntowards the surface one by one, and plunging down again. Edith was\r\nthere in all her majesty of brow and figure; and close to her came\r\nFlorence, with her timid head turned to him, as it had been, for an\r\ninstant, when she left the room; and Edith\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon her, and Edith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand put out protectingly. A little figure in a low arm-chair came\r\nspringing next into the light, and looked upon him wonderingly, with\r\nits bright eyes and its old-young face, gleaming as in the flickering\r\nof an evening fire. Again came Florence close upon it, and absorbed his\r\nwhole attention. Whether as a fore-doomed difficulty and disappointment\r\nto him; whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way, and might\r\nagain; whether as his child, of whom, in his successful wooing, he\r\ncould stoop to think as claiming, at such a time, to be no more\r\nestranged; or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of\r\ncaring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations; he\r\nbest knew. Indifferently well, perhaps, at best; for marriage company\r\nand marriage altars, and ambitious scenes\xe2\x80\x94still blotted here and there\r\nwith Florence\xe2\x80\x94always Florence\xe2\x80\x94turned up so fast, and so confusedly,\r\nthat he rose, and went upstairs to escape them.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late at night before candles were brought; for at present\r\nthey made Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s head ache, she complained; and in the meantime\r\nFlorence and Mrs Skewton talked together (Cleopatra being very anxious\r\nto keep her close to herself), or Florence touched the piano softly for\r\nMrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s delight; to make no mention of a few occasions in the\r\ncourse of the evening, when that affectionate lady was impelled to\r\nsolicit another kiss, and which always happened after Edith had said\r\nanything. They were not many, however, for Edith sat apart by an open\r\nwindow during the whole time (in spite of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s fears that she\r\nwould take cold), and remained there until Mr Dombey took leave. He was\r\nserenely gracious to Florence when he did so; and Florence went to bed\r\nin a room within Edith\xe2\x80\x99s, so happy and hopeful, that she thought of her\r\nlate self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be\r\npitied for her sorrow; and in her pity, sobbed herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe week fled fast. There were drives to milliners, dressmakers,\r\njewellers, lawyers, florists, pastry-cooks; and Florence was always of\r\nthe party. Florence was to go to the wedding. Florence was to cast off\r\nher mourning, and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion. The\r\nmilliner\xe2\x80\x99s intentions on the subject of this dress\xe2\x80\x94the milliner was a\r\nFrenchwoman, and greatly resembled Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x94were so chaste and\r\nelegant, that Mrs Skewton bespoke one like it for herself. The milliner\r\nsaid it would become her to admiration, and that all the world would\r\ntake her for the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\r\n\r\nThe week fled faster. Edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing.\r\nHer rich dresses came home, and were tried on, and were loudly\r\ncommended by Mrs Skewton and the milliners, and were put away without a\r\nword from her. Mrs Skewton made their plans for every day, and executed\r\nthem. Sometimes Edith sat in the carriage when they went to make\r\npurchases; sometimes, when it was absolutely necessary, she went into\r\nthe shops. But Mrs Skewton conducted the whole business, whatever it\r\nhappened to be; and Edith looked on as uninterested and with as much\r\napparent indifference as if she had no concern in it. Florence might\r\nperhaps have thought she was haughty and listless, but that she was\r\nnever so to her. So Florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude\r\nwhenever it broke out, and soon subdued it.\r\n\r\nThe week fled faster. It had nearly winged its flight away. The last\r\nnight of the week, the night before the marriage, was come. In the dark\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s head was no better yet, though she expected to\r\nrecover permanently to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94were that lady, Edith, and Mr Dombey.\r\nEdith was at her open window looking out into the street; Mr Dombey and\r\nCleopatra were talking softly on the sofa. It was growing late; and\r\nFlorence, being fatigued, had gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will leave me Florence\r\nto-morrow, when you deprive me of my sweetest Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey said he would, with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have her about me, here, while you are both at Paris, and to think\r\nat her age, I am assisting in the formation of her mind, my dear\r\nDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be a perfect balm to me in the extremely\r\nshattered state to which I shall be reduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith turned her head suddenly. Her listless manner was exchanged, in a\r\nmoment, to one of burning interest, and, unseen in the darkness, she\r\nattended closely to their conversation.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey would be delighted to leave Florence in such admirable\r\nguardianship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand thanks for your good\r\nopinion. I feared you were going, with malice aforethought, as the\r\ndreadful lawyers say\xe2\x80\x94those horrid prosers!\xe2\x80\x94to condemn me to utter\r\nsolitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do me so great an injustice, my dear madam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause my charming Florence tells me so positively she must go home\r\ntomorrow, returned Cleopatra, that I began to be afraid, my dearest\r\nDombey, you were quite a Bashaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI have laid no commands on\r\nFlorence; and if I had, there are no commands like your wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cleopatra, what a courtier you are! Though\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not say so, either; for courtiers have no heart, and yours\r\npervades your farming life and character. And are you really going so\r\nearly, my dear Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, indeed! it was late, and Mr Dombey feared he must.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a fact, or is it all a dream!\xe2\x80\x9d lisped Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I\r\nbelieve, my dearest Dombey, that you are coming back tomorrow morning\r\nto deprive me of my sweet companion; my own Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, who was accustomed to take things literally, reminded Mrs\r\nSkewton that they were to meet first at the church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pang,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cof consigning a child, even to you, my\r\ndear Dombey, is one of the most excruciating imaginable, and combined\r\nwith a naturally delicate constitution, and the extreme stupidity of\r\nthe pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast, is almost too much\r\nfor my poor strength. But I shall rally, my dear Dombey, in the\r\nmorning; do not fear for me, or be uneasy on my account. Heaven bless\r\nyou! My dearest Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried archly. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody is going, pet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, who had turned her head again towards the window, and whose\r\ninterest in their conversation had ceased, rose up in her place, but\r\nmade no advance towards him, and said nothing. Mr Dombey, with a lofty\r\ngallantry adapted to his dignity and the occasion, betook his creaking\r\nboots towards her, put her hand to his lips, said, \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow morning I\r\nshall have the happiness of claiming this hand as Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nbowed himself solemnly out.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton rang for candles as soon as the house-door had closed upon\r\nhim. With the candles appeared her maid, with the juvenile dress that\r\nwas to delude the world to-morrow. The dress had savage retribution in\r\nit, as such dresses ever have, and made her infinitely older and more\r\nhideous than her greasy flannel gown. But Mrs Skewton tried it on with\r\nmincing satisfaction; smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass, as\r\nshe thought of its killing effect upon the Major; and suffering her\r\nmaid to take it off again, and to prepare her for repose, tumbled into\r\nruins like a house of painted cards.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Edith remained at the dark window looking out into the\r\nstreet. When she and her mother were at last left alone, she moved from\r\nit for the first time that evening, and came opposite to her. The\r\nyawning, shaking, peevish figure of the mother, with her eyes raised to\r\nconfront the proud erect form of the daughter, whose glance of fire was\r\nbent downward upon her, had a conscious air upon it, that no levity or\r\ntemper could conceal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired to death,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted for a moment.\r\nYou are worse than a child. Child! No child would be half so obstinate\r\nand undutiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edith, passing these words by with a\r\nscorn that would not descend to trifle with them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must remain\r\nalone here until I return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust remain alone here, Edith, until you return!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr in that name upon which I shall call to-morrow to witness what I\r\ndo, so falsely: and so shamefully, I swear I will refuse the hand of\r\nthis man in the church. If I do not, may I fall dead upon the\r\npavement!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother answered with a look of quick alarm, in no degree diminished\r\nby the look she met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are what we are. I will\r\nhave no youth and truth dragged down to my level. I will have no\r\nguileless nature undermined, corrupted, and perverted, to amuse the\r\nleisure of a world of mothers. You know my meaning. Florence must go\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an idiot, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her angry mother. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect there\r\ncan ever be peace for you in that house, till she is married, and\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me, or ask yourself, if I ever expect peace in that house,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nher daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cand you know the answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to be told tonight, after all my pains and labour, and when\r\nyou are going, through me, to be rendered independent,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother\r\nalmost shrieked in her passion, while her palsied head shook like a\r\nleaf, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is corruption and contagion in me, and that I am not\r\nfit company for a girl! What are you, pray? What are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have put the question to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, ashy pale, and\r\npointing to the window, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than once when I have been sitting there,\r\nand something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past\r\noutside; and God knows I have met with my reply. Oh mother, mother, if\r\nyou had but left me to my natural heart when I too was a girl\xe2\x80\x94a younger\r\ngirl than Florence\xe2\x80\x94how different I might have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSensible that any show of anger was useless here, her mother restrained\r\nherself, and fell a whimpering, and bewailed that she had lived too\r\nlong, and that her only child had cast her off, and that duty towards\r\nparents was forgotten in these evil days, and that she had heard\r\nunnatural taunts, and cared for life no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one is to go on living through continual scenes like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhined, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it would be much better for me to think of some\r\nmeans of putting an end to my existence. Oh! The idea of your being my\r\ndaughter, Edith, and addressing me in such a strain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween us, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edith, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthe time for mutual\r\nreproaches is past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you revive it?\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that you\r\nare lacerating me in the cruellest manner. You know how sensitive I am\r\nto unkindness. At such a moment, too, when I have so much to think of,\r\nand am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage! I wonder at\r\nyou, Edith. To make your mother a fright upon your wedding-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith bent the same fixed look upon her, as she sobbed and rubbed her\r\neyes; and said in the same low steady voice, which had neither risen\r\nnor fallen since she first addressed her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have said that Florence\r\nmust go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the afflicted and affrighted parent, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure I am willing she should go. What is the girl to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is so much to me, that rather than communicate, or suffer to be\r\ncommunicated to her, one grain of the evil that is in my breast,\r\nmother, I would renounce you, as I would (if you gave me cause)\r\nrenounce him in the church to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave her alone.\r\nShe shall not, while I can interpose, be tampered with and tainted by\r\nthe lessons I have learned. This is no hard condition on this bitter\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had proposed it in a filial manner, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d whined her mother,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not; very likely not. But such extremely cutting words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are past and at an end between us now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cTake your\r\nown way, mother; share as you please in what you have gained; spend,\r\nenjoy, make much of it; and be as happy as you will. The object of our\r\nlives is won. Henceforth let us wear it silently. My lips are closed\r\nupon the past from this hour. I forgive you your part in to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwickedness. May God forgive my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a tremor in her voice, or frame, and passing onward with a foot\r\nthat set itself upon the neck of every soft emotion, she bade her\r\nmother good-night, and repaired to her own room.\r\n\r\nBut not to rest; for there was no rest in the tumult of her agitation\r\nwhen alone to and fro, and to and fro, and to and fro again, five\r\nhundred times, among the splendid preparations for her adornment on the\r\nmorrow; with her dark hair shaken down, her dark eyes flashing with a\r\nraging light, her broad white bosom red with the cruel grasp of the\r\nrelentless hand with which she spurned it from her, pacing up and down\r\nwith an averted head, as if she would avoid the sight of her own fair\r\nperson, and divorce herself from its companionship. Thus, in the dead\r\ntime of the night before her bridal, Edith Granger wrestled with her\r\nunquiet spirit, tearless, friendless, silent, proud, and uncomplaining.\r\n\r\nAt length it happened that she touched the open door which led into the\r\nroom where Florence lay.\r\n\r\nShe started, stopped, and looked in.\r\n\r\nA light was burning there, and showed her Florence in her bloom of\r\ninnocence and beauty, fast asleep. Edith held her breath, and felt\r\nherself drawn on towards her.\r\n\r\nDrawn nearer, nearer, nearer yet; at last, drawn so near, that stooping\r\ndown, she pressed her lips to the gentle hand that lay outside the bed,\r\nand put it softly to her neck. Its touch was like the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s rod of\r\nold upon the rock. Her tears sprung forth beneath it, as she sunk upon\r\nher knees, and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow\r\nby its side.\r\n\r\nThus Edith Granger passed the night before her bridal. Thus the sun\r\nfound her on her bridal morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nThe Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn with its passionless blank face, steals shivering to the church\r\nbeneath which lies the dust of little Paul and his mother, and looks in\r\nat the windows. It is cold and dark. Night crouches yet, upon the\r\npavement, and broods, sombre and heavy, in nooks and corners of the\r\nbuilding. The steeple-clock, perched up above the houses, emerging from\r\nbeneath another of the countless ripples in the tide of time that\r\nregularly roll and break on the eternal shore, is greyly visible, like\r\na stone beacon, recording how the sea flows on; but within doors, dawn,\r\nat first, can only peep at night, and see that it is there.\r\n\r\nHovering feebly round the church, and looking in, dawn moans and weeps\r\nfor its short reign, and its tears trickle on the window-glass, and the\r\ntrees against the church-wall bow their heads, and wring their many\r\nhands in sympathy. Night, growing pale before it, gradually fades out\r\nof the church, but lingers in the vaults below, and sits upon the\r\ncoffins. And now comes bright day, burnishing the steeple-clock, and\r\nreddening the spire, and drying up the tears of dawn, and stifling its\r\ncomplaining; and the dawn, following the night, and chasing it from its\r\nlast refuge, shrinks into the vaults itself and hides, with a\r\nfrightened face, among the dead, until night returns, refreshed, to\r\ndrive it out.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the mice, who have been busier with the prayer-books than\r\ntheir proper owners, and with the hassocks, more worn by their little\r\nteeth than by human knees, hide their bright eyes in their holes, and\r\ngather close together in affright at the resounding clashing of the\r\nchurch-door. For the beadle, that man of power, comes early this\r\nmorning with the sexton; and Mrs Miff, the wheezy little pew-opener\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmighty dry old lady, sparely dressed, with not an inch of fulness\r\nanywhere about her\xe2\x80\x94is also here, and has been waiting at the\r\nchurch-gate half-an-hour, as her place is, for the beadle.\r\n\r\nA vinegary face has Mrs Miff, and a mortified bonnet, and eke a thirsty\r\nsoul for sixpences and shillings. Beckoning to stray people to come\r\ninto pews, has given Mrs Miff an air of mystery; and there is\r\nreservation in the eye of Mrs Miff, as always knowing of a softer seat,\r\nbut having her suspicions of the fee. There is no such fact as Mr Miff,\r\nnor has there been, these twenty years, and Mrs Miff would rather not\r\nallude to him. He held some bad opinions, it would seem, about free\r\nseats; and though Mrs Miff hopes he may be gone upwards, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npositively undertake to say so.\r\n\r\nBusy is Mrs Miff this morning at the church-door, beating and dusting\r\nthe altar-cloth, the carpet, and the cushions; and much has Mrs Miff to\r\nsay, about the wedding they are going to have. Mrs Miff is told, that\r\nthe new furniture and alterations in the house cost full five thousand\r\npound if they cost a penny; and Mrs Miff has heard, upon the best\r\nauthority, that the lady hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a sixpence wherewithal to bless\r\nherself. Mrs Miff remembers, like wise, as if it had happened\r\nyesterday, the first wife\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, and then the christening, and then\r\nthe other funeral; and Mrs Miff says, by-the-by she\xe2\x80\x99ll soap-and-water\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cere tablet presently, against the company arrive. Mr Sownds the\r\nBeadle, who is sitting in the sun upon the church steps all this time\r\n(and seldom does anything else, except, in cold weather, sitting by the\r\nfire), approves of Mrs Miff\xe2\x80\x99s discourse, and asks if Mrs Miff has heard\r\nit said, that the lady is uncommon handsome? The information Mrs Miff\r\nhas received, being of this nature, Mr Sownds the Beadle, who, though\r\northodox and corpulent, is still an admirer of female beauty, observes,\r\nwith unction, yes, he hears she is a spanker\xe2\x80\x94an expression that seems\r\nsomewhat forcible to Mrs Miff, or would, from any lips but those of Mr\r\nSownds the Beadle.\r\n\r\nIn Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, at this same time, there is great stir and\r\nbustle, more especially among the women: not one of whom has had a wink\r\nof sleep since four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and all of whom were fully dressed before\r\nsix. Mr Towlinson is an object of greater consideration than usual to\r\nthe housemaid, and the cook says at breakfast time that one wedding\r\nmakes many, which the housemaid can\xe2\x80\x99t believe, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think true at\r\nall. Mr Towlinson reserves his sentiments on this question; being\r\nrendered something gloomy by the engagement of a foreigner with\r\nwhiskers (Mr Towlinson is whiskerless himself), who has been hired to\r\naccompany the happy pair to Paris, and who is busy packing the new\r\nchariot. In respect of this personage, Mr Towlinson admits, presently,\r\nthat he never knew of any good that ever come of foreigners; and being\r\ncharged by the ladies with prejudice, says, look at Bonaparte who was\r\nat the head of \xe2\x80\x99em, and see what he was always up to! Which the\r\nhousemaid says is very true.\r\n\r\nThe pastry-cook is hard at work in the funereal room in Brook Street,\r\nand the very tall young men are busy looking on. One of the very tall\r\nyoung men already smells of sherry, and his eyes have a tendency to\r\nbecome fixed in his head, and to stare at objects without seeing them.\r\nThe very tall young man is conscious of this failing in himself; and\r\ninforms his comrade that it\xe2\x80\x99s his \xe2\x80\x9cexciseman.\xe2\x80\x9d The very tall young man\r\nwould say excitement, but his speech is hazy.\r\n\r\nThe men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage; and the\r\nmarrow-bones and cleavers too; and a brass band too. The first, are\r\npractising in a back settlement near Battlebridge; the second, put\r\nthemselves in communication, through their chief, with Mr Towlinson, to\r\nwhom they offer terms to be bought off; and the third, in the person of\r\nan artful trombone, lurks and dodges round the corner, waiting for some\r\ntraitor tradesman to reveal the place and hour of breakfast, for a\r\nbribe. Expectation and excitement extend further yet, and take a wider\r\nrange. From Balls Pond, Mr Perch brings Mrs Perch to spend the day with\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and accompany them, surreptitiously, to see the\r\nwedding. In Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, Mr Toots attires himself as if he were\r\nat least the Bridegroom; determined to behold the spectacle in\r\nsplendour from a secret corner of the gallery, and thither to convey\r\nthe Chicken: for it is Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s desperate intent to point out\r\nFlorence to the Chicken, then and there, and openly to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nChicken, I will not deceive you any longer; the friend I have sometimes\r\nmentioned to you is myself; Miss Dombey is the object of my passion;\r\nwhat are your opinions, Chicken, in this state of things, and what, on\r\nthe spot, do you advise? The so-much-to-be-astonished Chicken, in the\r\nmeanwhile, dips his beak into a tankard of strong beer, in Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkitchen, and pecks up two pounds of beefsteaks. In Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place,\r\nMiss Tox is up and doing; for she too, though in sore distress, is\r\nresolved to put a shilling in the hands of Mrs Miff, and see the\r\nceremony which has a cruel fascination for her, from some lonely\r\ncorner. The quarters of the wooden Midshipman are all alive; for\r\nCaptain Cuttle, in his ankle-jacks and with a huge shirt-collar, is\r\nseated at his breakfast, listening to Rob the Grinder as he reads the\r\nmarriage service to him beforehand, under orders, to the end that the\r\nCaptain may perfectly understand the solemnity he is about to witness:\r\nfor which purpose, the Captain gravely lays injunctions on his\r\nchaplain, from time to time, to \xe2\x80\x9cput about,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9coverhaul that \xe2\x80\x9cere\r\narticle again,\xe2\x80\x9d or to stick to his own duty, and leave the Amens to\r\nhim, the Captain; one of which he repeats, whenever a pause is made by\r\nRob the Grinder, with sonorous satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, and much more, twenty nursery-maids in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstreet alone, have promised twenty families of little women, whose\r\ninstinctive interest in nuptials dates from their cradles, that they\r\nshall go and see the marriage. Truly, Mr Sownds the Beadle has good\r\nreason to feel himself in office, as he suns his portly figure on the\r\nchurch steps, waiting for the marriage hour. Truly, Mrs Miff has cause\r\nto pounce on an unlucky dwarf child, with a giant baby, who peeps in at\r\nthe porch, and drive her forth with indignation!\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix has come over from abroad, expressly to attend the\r\nmarriage. Cousin Feenix was a man about town, forty years ago; but he\r\nis still so juvenile in figure and in manner, and so well got up, that\r\nstrangers are amazed when they discover latent wrinkles in his\r\nlordship\xe2\x80\x99s face, and crows\xe2\x80\x99 feet in his eyes: and first observe him,\r\nnot exactly certain when he walks across a room, of going quite\r\nstraight to where he wants to go. But Cousin Feenix, getting up at\r\nhalf-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock or so, is quite another thing from Cousin\r\nFeenix got up; and very dim, indeed, he looks, while being shaved at\r\nLong\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, in Bond Street.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey leaves his dressing-room, amidst a general whisking away of\r\nthe women on the staircase, who disperse in all directions, with a\r\ngreat rustling of skirts, except Mrs Perch, who, being (but that she\r\nalways is) in an interesting situation, is not nimble, and is obliged\r\nto face him, and is ready to sink with confusion as she curtesys;\xe2\x80\x94may\r\nHeaven avert all evil consequences from the house of Perch! Mr Dombey\r\nwalks up to the drawing-room, to bide his time. Gorgeous are Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s new blue coat, fawn-coloured pantaloons, and lilac waistcoat;\r\nand a whisper goes about the house, that Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s hair is curled.\r\n\r\nA double knock announces the arrival of the Major, who is gorgeous too,\r\nand wears a whole geranium in his button-hole, and has his hair curled\r\ntight and crisp, as well the Native knows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, putting out both hands, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9chow are You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cJoey B. is in such case this morning,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and here he hits himself hard upon the breast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIn such case this\r\nmorning, Sir, that, damme, Dombey, he has half a mind to make a double\r\nmarriage of it, Sir, and take the mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey smiles; but faintly, even for him; for Mr Dombey feels that\r\nhe is going to be related to the mother, and that, under those\r\ncircumstances, she is not to be joked about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, seeing this, \xe2\x80\x9cI give you joy. I congratulate\r\nyou, Dombey. By the Lord, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are more to be\r\nenvied, this day, than any man in England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere again Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s assent is qualified; because he is going to\r\nconfer a great distinction on a lady; and, no doubt, she is to be\r\nenvied most.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Edith Granger, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursues the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a woman in\r\nall Europe but might\xe2\x80\x94and would, Sir, you will allow Bagstock to add\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94give her ears, and her earrings, too, to be in Edith Granger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good enough to say so, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returns the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know it. Let us have no false\r\ndelicacy. You know it. Do you know it, or do you not, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nMajor, almost in a passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, really, Major\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorts the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that fact, or do you not?\r\nDombey! Is old Joe your friend? Are we on that footing of unreserved\r\nintimacy, Dombey, that may justify a man\xe2\x80\x94a blunt old Joseph B., Sir\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nspeaking out; or am I to take open order, Dombey, and to keep my\r\ndistance, and to stand on forms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Major Bagstock,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey, with a gratified air, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare quite warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cI am warm. Joseph B. does not deny it,\r\nDombey. He is warm. This is an occasion, Sir, that calls forth all the\r\nhonest sympathies remaining in an old, infernal, battered, used-up,\r\ninvalided, J. B. carcase. And I tell you what, Dombey\xe2\x80\x94at such a time a\r\nman must blurt out what he feels, or put a muzzle on; and Joseph\r\nBagstock tells you to your face, Dombey, as he tells his club behind\r\nyour back, that he never will be muzzled when Paul Dombey is in\r\nquestion. Now, damme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d concludes the Major, with great firmness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you make of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that I am really obliged to you.\r\nI had no idea of checking your too partial friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too partial, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaims the choleric Major. \xe2\x80\x9cDombey, I deny\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friendship I will say then,\xe2\x80\x9d pursues Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9con any account.\r\nNor can I forget, Major, on such an occasion as the present, how much I\r\nam indebted to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, with appropriate action, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the hand of\r\nJoseph Bagstock: of plain old Joey B., Sir, if you like that better!\r\nThat is the hand, of which His Royal Highness the late Duke of York,\r\ndid me the honour to observe, Sir, to His Royal Highness the late Duke\r\nof Kent, that it was the hand of Josh: a rough and tough, and possibly\r\nan up-to-snuff, old vagabond. Dombey, may the present moment be the\r\nleast unhappy of our lives. God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow enters Mr Carker, gorgeous likewise, and smiling like a\r\nwedding-guest indeed. He can scarcely let Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s hand go, he is so\r\ncongratulatory; and he shakes the Major\xe2\x80\x99s hand so heartily at the same\r\ntime, that his voice shakes too, in accord with his arms, as it comes\r\nsliding from between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very day is auspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brightest and most\r\ngenial weather! I hope I am not a moment late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPunctual to your time, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rejoiced, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid I might be a\r\nfew seconds after the appointed time, for I was delayed by a procession\r\nof waggons; and I took the liberty of riding round to Brook\r\nStreet\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto leave a few poor rarities of flowers for\r\nMrs Dombey. A man in my position, and so distinguished as to be invited\r\nhere, is proud to offer some homage in acknowledgment of his vassalage:\r\nand as I have no doubt Mrs Dombey is overwhelmed with what is costly\r\nand magnificent;\xe2\x80\x9d with a strange glance at his patron; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the very\r\npoverty of my offering, may find favour for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey, that is to be,\xe2\x80\x9d returns Mr Dombey, condescendingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\nbe very sensible of your attention, Carker, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if she is to be Mrs Dombey this morning, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major,\r\nputting down his coffee-cup, and looking at his watch, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s high time\r\nwe were off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForth, in a barouche, ride Mr Dombey, Major Bagstock, and Mr Carker, to\r\nthe church. Mr Sownds the Beadle has long risen from the steps, and is\r\nin waiting with his cocked hat in his hand. Mrs Miff curtseys and\r\nproposes chairs in the vestry. Mr Dombey prefers remaining in the\r\nchurch. As he looks up at the organ, Miss Tox in the gallery shrinks\r\nbehind the fat leg of a cherubim on a monument, with cheeks like a\r\nyoung Wind. Captain Cuttle, on the contrary, stands up and waves his\r\nhook, in token of welcome and encouragement. Mr Toots informs the\r\nChicken, behind his hand, that the middle gentleman, he in the\r\nfawn-coloured pantaloons, is the father of his love. The Chicken\r\nhoarsely whispers Mr Toots that he\xe2\x80\x99s as stiff a cove as ever he see,\r\nbut that it is within the resources of Science to double him up, with\r\none blow in the waistcoat.\r\n\r\nMr Sownds and Mrs Miff are eyeing Mr Dombey from a little distance,\r\nwhen the noise of approaching wheels is heard, and Mr Sownds goes out.\r\nMrs Miff, meeting Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s eye as it is withdrawn from the\r\npresumptuous maniac upstairs, who salutes him with so much urbanity,\r\ndrops a curtsey, and informs him that she believes his \xe2\x80\x9cgood lady\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\ncome. Then there is a crowding and a whispering at the door, and the\r\ngood lady enters, with a haughty step.\r\n\r\nThere is no sign upon her face, of last night\xe2\x80\x99s suffering; there is no\r\ntrace in her manner, of the woman on the bended knees, reposing her\r\nwild head, in beautiful abandonment, upon the pillow of the sleeping\r\ngirl. That girl, all gentle and lovely, is at her side\xe2\x80\x94a striking\r\ncontrast to her own disdainful and defiant figure, standing there,\r\ncomposed, erect, inscrutable of will, resplendent and majestic in the\r\nzenith of its charms, yet beating down, and treading on, the admiration\r\nthat it challenges.\r\n\r\nThere is a pause while Mr Sownds the Beadle glides into the vestry for\r\nthe clergyman and clerk. At this juncture, Mrs Skewton speaks to Mr\r\nDombey: more distinctly and emphatically than her custom is, and moving\r\nat the same time, close to Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good Mama, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear I must relinquish darling\r\nFlorence after all, and suffer her to go home, as she herself proposed.\r\nAfter my loss of today, my dear Dombey, I feel I shall not have\r\nspirits, even for her society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad she not better stay with you?\xe2\x80\x9d returns the Bridegroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, my dear Dombey. No, I think not. I shall be better alone.\r\nBesides, my dearest Edith will be her natural and constant guardian\r\nwhen you return, and I had better not encroach upon her trust, perhaps.\r\nShe might be jealous. Eh, dear Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe affectionate Mama presses her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as she says this;\r\nperhaps entreating her attention earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be serious, my dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumes, \xe2\x80\x9cI will relinquish our\r\ndear child, and not inflict my gloom upon her. We have settled that,\r\njust now. She fully understands, dear Dombey. Edith, my dear,\xe2\x80\x94she fully\r\nunderstands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, the good mother presses her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Mr Dombey offers no\r\nadditional remonstrance; for the clergyman and clerk appear; and Mrs\r\nMiff, and Mr Sownds the Beadle, group the party in their proper places\r\nat the altar rails.\r\n\r\nThe sun is shining down, upon the golden letters of the ten\r\ncommandments. Why does the Bride\xe2\x80\x99s eye read them, one by one? Which one\r\nof all the ten appears the plainest to her in the glare of light? False\r\nGods; murder; theft; the honour that she owes her mother;\xe2\x80\x94which is it\r\nthat appears to leave the wall, and printing itself in glowing letters,\r\non her book!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho giveth this woman to be married to this man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix does that. He has come from Baden-Baden on purpose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it,\xe2\x80\x9d Cousin Feenix says\xe2\x80\x94good-natured creature, Cousin\r\nFeenix\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhen we do get a rich City fellow into the family, let us show\r\nhim some attention; let us do something for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give this woman to be married to this man,\xe2\x80\x9d saith Cousin Feenix\r\ntherefore. Cousin Feenix, meaning to go in a straight line, but turning\r\noff sideways by reason of his wilful legs, gives the wrong woman to be\r\nmarried to this man, at first\xe2\x80\x94to wit, a brides\xe2\x80\x94maid of some condition,\r\ndistantly connected with the family, and ten years Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s junior\r\n\xe2\x80\x94but Mrs Miff, interposing her mortified bonnet, dexterously turns him\r\nback, and runs him, as on castors, full at the \xe2\x80\x9cgood lady:\xe2\x80\x9d whom Cousin\r\nFeenix giveth to married to this man accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd will they in the sight of heaven\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nAy, that they will: Mr Dombey says he will. And what says Edith? She\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nSo, from that day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer,\r\nin sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do them\r\npart, they plight their troth to one another, and are married.\r\n\r\nIn a firm, free hand, the Bride subscribes her name in the register,\r\nwhen they adjourn to the vestry. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a many ladies come here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs Miff says with a curtsey\xe2\x80\x94to look at Mrs Miff, at such a season, is\r\nto make her mortified bonnet go down with a dip\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwrites their names\r\nlike this good lady!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Sownds the Beadle thinks it is a truly\r\nspanking signature, and worthy of the writer\xe2\x80\x94this, however, between\r\nhimself and conscience.\r\n\r\nFlorence signs too, but unapplauded, for her hand shakes. All the party\r\nsign; Cousin Feenix last; who puts his noble name into a wrong place,\r\nand enrols himself as having been born that morning.\r\n\r\nThe Major now salutes the Bride right gallantly, and carries out that\r\nbranch of military tactics in reference to all the ladies:\r\nnotwithstanding Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s being extremely hard to kiss, and\r\nsqueaking shrilly in the sacred edifice. The example is followed by\r\nCousin Feenix and even by Mr Dombey. Lastly, Mr Carker, with his white\r\nteeth glistening, approaches Edith, more as if he meant to bite her,\r\nthan to taste the sweets that linger on her lips.\r\n\r\nThere is a glow upon her proud cheek, and a flashing in her eyes, that\r\nmay be meant to stay him; but it does not, for he salutes her as the\r\nrest have done, and wishes her all happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d says he in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9care not superfluous, applied to\r\nsuch a union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answers, with a curled lip, and a heaving\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nBut, does Edith feel still, as on the night when she knew that Mr\r\nDombey would return to offer his alliance, that Carker knows her\r\nthoroughly, and reads her right, and that she is more degraded by his\r\nknowledge of her, than by aught else? Is it for this reason that her\r\nhaughtiness shrinks beneath his smile, like snow within the hands that\r\ngrasps it firmly, and that her imperious glance droops in meeting his,\r\nand seeks the ground?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with a servile stooping of his\r\nneck, which the revelations making by his eyes and teeth proclaim to be\r\na lie, \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to see that my humble offering is graced by Mrs\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and permitted to hold so favoured a place in so joyful\r\nan occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she bends her head, in answer, there is something in the\r\nmomentary action of her hand, as if she would crush the flowers it\r\nholds, and fling them, with contempt, upon the ground. But, she puts\r\nthe hand through the arm of her new husband, who has been standing\r\nnear, conversing with the Major, and is proud again, and motionless,\r\nand silent.\r\n\r\nThe carriages are once more at the church door. Mr Dombey, with his\r\nbride upon his arm, conducts her through the twenty families of little\r\nwomen who are on the steps, and every one of whom remembers the fashion\r\nand the colour of her every article of dress from that moment, and\r\nreproduces it on her doll, who is for ever being married. Cleopatra and\r\nCousin Feenix enter the same carriage. The Major hands into a second\r\ncarriage, Florence, and the bridesmaid who so narrowly escaped being\r\ngiven away by mistake, and then enters it himself, and is followed by\r\nMr Carker. Horses prance and caper; coachmen and footmen shine in\r\nfluttering favours, flowers, and new-made liveries. Away they dash and\r\nrattle through the streets; and as they pass along, a thousand heads\r\nare turned to look at them, and a thousand sober moralists revenge\r\nthemselves for not being married too, that morning, by reflecting that\r\nthese people little think such happiness can\xe2\x80\x99t last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMiss Tox emerges from behind the cherubim\xe2\x80\x99s leg, when all is quiet, and\r\ncomes slowly down from the gallery. Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are red, and her\r\npocket-handkerchief is damp. She is wounded, but not exasperated, and\r\nshe hopes they may be happy. She quite admits to herself the beauty of\r\nthe bride, and her own comparatively feeble and faded attractions; but\r\nthe stately image of Mr Dombey in his lilac waistcoat, and his\r\nfawn-coloured pantaloons, is present to her mind, and Miss Tox weeps\r\nafresh, behind her veil, on her way home to Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place. Captain\r\nCuttle, having joined in all the amens and responses, with a devout\r\ngrowl, feels much improved by his religious exercises; and in a\r\npeaceful frame of mind pervades the body of the church, glazed hat in\r\nhand, and reads the tablet to the memory of little Paul. The gallant Mr\r\nToots, attended by the faithful Chicken, leaves the building in\r\ntorments of love. The Chicken is as yet unable to elaborate a scheme\r\nfor winning Florence, but his first idea has gained possession of him,\r\nand he thinks the doubling up of Mr Dombey would be a move in the right\r\ndirection. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s servants come out of their hiding-places, and\r\nprepare to rush to Brook Street, when they are delayed by symptoms of\r\nindisposition on the part of Mrs Perch, who entreats a glass of water,\r\nand becomes alarming; Mrs Perch gets better soon, however, and is borne\r\naway; and Mrs Miff, and Mr Sownds the Beadle, sit upon the steps to\r\ncount what they have gained by the affair, and talk it over, while the\r\nsexton tolls a funeral.\r\n\r\nNow, the carriages arrive at the Bride\xe2\x80\x99s residence, and the players on\r\nthe bells begin to jingle, and the band strikes up, and Mr Punch, that\r\nmodel of connubial bliss, salutes his wife. Now, the people run, and\r\npush, and press round in a gaping throng, while Mr Dombey, leading Mrs\r\nDombey by the hand, advances solemnly into the Feenix Halls. Now, the\r\nrest of the wedding party alight, and enter after them. And why does Mr\r\nCarker, passing through the people to the hall-door, think of the old\r\nwoman who called to him in the Grove that morning? Or why does\r\nFlorence, as she passes, think, with a tremble, of her childhood, when\r\nshe was lost, and of the visage of Good Mrs Brown?\r\n\r\nNow, there are more congratulations on this happiest of days, and more\r\ncompany, though not much; and now they leave the drawing-room, and\r\nrange themselves at table in the dark-brown dining-room, which no\r\nconfectioner can brighten up, let him garnish the exhausted negroes\r\nwith as many flowers and love-knots as he will.\r\n\r\nThe pastry-cook has done his duty like a man, though, and a rich\r\nbreakfast is set forth. Mr and Mrs Chick have joined the party, among\r\nothers. Mrs Chick admires that Edith should be, by nature, such a\r\nperfect Dombey; and is affable and confidential to Mrs Skewton, whose\r\nmind is relieved of a great load, and who takes her share of the\r\nchampagne. The very tall young man who suffered from excitement early,\r\nis better; but a vague sentiment of repentance has seized upon him, and\r\nhe hates the other very tall young man, and wrests dishes from him by\r\nviolence, and takes a grim delight in disobliging the company. The\r\ncompany are cool and calm, and do not outrage the black hatchments of\r\npictures looking down upon them, by any excess of mirth. Cousin Feenix\r\nand the Major are the gayest there; but Mr Carker has a smile for the\r\nwhole table. He has an especial smile for the Bride, who very, very\r\nseldom meets it.\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix rises, when the company have breakfasted, and the\r\nservants have left the room; and wonderfully young he looks, with his\r\nwhite wristbands almost covering his hands (otherwise rather bony), and\r\nthe bloom of the champagne in his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9calthough it\xe2\x80\x99s an unusual sort of\r\nthing in a private gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house, I must beg leave to call upon you\r\nto drink what is usually called a\xe2\x80\x94in fact a toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major very hoarsely indicates his approval. Mr Carker, bending his\r\nhead forward over the table in the direction of Cousin Feenix, smiles\r\nand nods a great many times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s not a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Cousin Feenix beginning again, thus, comes to a\r\ndead stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, in a tone of conviction.\r\n\r\nMr Carker softly claps his hands, and bending forward over the table\r\nagain, smiles and nods a great many more times than before, as if he\r\nwere particularly struck by this last observation, and desired\r\npersonally to express his sense of the good it has done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9can occasion in fact, when the general\r\nusages of life may be a little departed from, without impropriety; and\r\nalthough I never was an orator in my life, and when I was in the House\r\nof Commons, and had the honour of seconding the address, was\xe2\x80\x94in fact,\r\nwas laid up for a fortnight with the consciousness of failure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major and Mr Carker are so much delighted by this fragment of\r\npersonal history, that Cousin Feenix laughs, and addressing them\r\nindividually, goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in point of fact, when I was devilish ill\xe2\x80\x94still, you know, I feel\r\nthat a duty devolves upon me. And when a duty devolves upon an\r\nEnglishman, he is bound to get out of it, in my opinion, in the best\r\nway he can. Well! our family has had the gratification, today, of\r\nconnecting itself, in the person of my lovely and accomplished\r\nrelative, whom I now see\xe2\x80\x94in point of fact, present\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere there is general applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent,\xe2\x80\x9d repeats Cousin Feenix, feeling that it is a neat point which\r\nwill bear repetition,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith one who\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, with a man, at whom\r\nthe finger of scorn can never\xe2\x80\x94in fact, with my honourable friend\r\nDombey, if he will allow me to call him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix bows to Mr Dombey; Mr Dombey solemnly returns the bow;\r\neverybody is more or less gratified and affected by this extraordinary,\r\nand perhaps unprecedented, appeal to the feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cenjoyed those opportunities which I\r\ncould have desired, of cultivating the acquaintance of my friend\r\nDombey, and studying those qualities which do equal honour to his head,\r\nand, in point of fact, to his heart; for it has been my misfortune to\r\nbe, as we used to say in my time in the House of Commons, when it was\r\nnot the custom to allude to the Lords, and when the order of\r\nparliamentary proceedings was perhaps better observed than it is now\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe in\xe2\x80\x94in point of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, cherishing his joke, with\r\ngreat slyness, and finally bringing it out with a jerk, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cin another\r\nplace!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Major falls into convulsions, and is recovered with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know sufficient of my friend Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d resumes Cousin Feenix in a\r\ngraver tone, as if he had suddenly become a sadder and wiser man, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nknow that he is, in point of fact, what may be emphatically called a\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmerchant\xe2\x80\x94a British merchant\xe2\x80\x94and a\xe2\x80\x94and a man. And although I have been\r\nresident abroad, for some years (it would give me great pleasure to\r\nreceive my friend Dombey, and everybody here, at Baden-Baden, and to\r\nhave an opportunity of making \xe2\x80\x99em known to the Grand Duke), still I\r\nknow enough, I flatter myself, of my lovely and accomplished relative,\r\nto know that she possesses every requisite to make a man happy, and\r\nthat her marriage with my friend Dombey is one of inclination and\r\naffection on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany smiles and nods from Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate the family of which I\r\nam a member, on the acquisition of my friend Dombey. I congratulate my\r\nfriend Dombey on his union with my lovely and accomplished relative who\r\npossesses every requisite to make a man happy; and I take the liberty\r\nof calling on you all, in point of fact, to congratulate both my friend\r\nDombey and my lovely and accomplished relative, on the present\r\noccasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speech of Cousin Feenix is received with great applause, and Mr\r\nDombey returns thanks on behalf of himself and Mrs Dombey. J. B.\r\nshortly afterwards proposes Mrs Skewton. The breakfast languishes when\r\nthat is done, the violated hatchments are avenged, and Edith rises to\r\nassume her travelling dress.\r\n\r\nAll the servants in the meantime, have been breakfasting below.\r\nChampagne has grown too common among them to be mentioned, and roast\r\nfowls, raised pies, and lobster-salad, have become mere drugs. The very\r\ntall young man has recovered his spirits, and again alludes to the\r\nexciseman. His comrade\xe2\x80\x99s eye begins to emulate his own, and he, too,\r\nstares at objects without taking cognizance thereof. There is a general\r\nredness in the faces of the ladies; in the face of Mrs Perch\r\nparticularly, who is joyous and beaming, and lifted so far above the\r\ncares of life, that if she were asked just now to direct a wayfarer to\r\nBall\xe2\x80\x99s Pond, where her own cares lodge, she would have some difficulty\r\nin recalling the way. Mr Towlinson has proposed the happy pair; to\r\nwhich the silver-headed butler has responded neatly, and with emotion;\r\nfor he half begins to think he is an old retainer of the family, and\r\nthat he is bound to be affected by these changes. The whole party, and\r\nespecially the ladies, are very frolicsome. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s cook, who\r\ngenerally takes the lead in society, has said, it is impossible to\r\nsettle down after this, and why not go, in a party, to the play?\r\nEverybody (Mrs Perch included) has agreed to this; even the Native, who\r\nis tigerish in his drink, and who alarms the ladies (Mrs Perch\r\nparticularly) by the rolling of his eyes. One of the very tall young\r\nmen has even proposed a ball after the play, and it presents itself to\r\nno one (Mrs Perch included) in the light of an impossibility. Words\r\nhave arisen between the housemaid and Mr Towlinson; she, on the\r\nauthority of an old saw, asserting marriages to be made in Heaven: he,\r\naffecting to trace the manufacture elsewhere; he, supposing that she\r\nsays so, because she thinks of being married her own self: she, saying,\r\nLord forbid, at any rate, that she should ever marry him. To calm these\r\nflying taunts, the silver-headed butler rises to propose the health of\r\nMr Towlinson, whom to know is to esteem, and to esteem is to wish well\r\nsettled in life with the object of his choice, wherever (here the\r\nsilver-headed butler eyes the housemaid) she may be. Mr Towlinson\r\nreturns thanks in a speech replete with feeling, of which the\r\nperoration turns on foreigners, regarding whom he says they may find\r\nfavour, sometimes, with weak and inconstant intellects that can be led\r\naway by hair, but all he hopes, is, he may never hear of no foreigner\r\nnever boning nothing out of no travelling chariot. The eye of Mr\r\nTowlinson is so severe and so expressive here, that the housemaid is\r\nturning hysterical, when she and all the rest, roused by the\r\nintelligence that the Bride is going away, hurry upstairs to witness\r\nher departure.\r\n\r\nThe chariot is at the door; the Bride is descending to the hall, where\r\nMr Dombey waits for her. Florence is ready on the staircase to depart\r\ntoo; and Miss Nipper, who has held a middle state between the parlour\r\nand the kitchen, is prepared to accompany her. As Edith appears,\r\nFlorence hastens towards her, to bid her farewell.\r\n\r\nIs Edith cold, that she should tremble! Is there anything unnatural or\r\nunwholesome in the touch of Florence, that the beautiful form recedes\r\nand contracts, as if it could not bear it! Is there so much hurry in\r\nthis going away, that Edith, with a wave of her hand, sweeps on, and is\r\ngone!\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton, overpowered by her feelings as a mother, sinks on her sofa\r\nin the Cleopatra attitude, when the clatter of the chariot wheels is\r\nlost, and sheds several tears. The Major, coming with the rest of the\r\ncompany from table, endeavours to comfort her; but she will not be\r\ncomforted on any terms, and so the Major takes his leave. Cousin Feenix\r\ntakes his leave, and Mr Carker takes his leave. The guests all go away.\r\nCleopatra, left alone, feels a little giddy from her strong emotion,\r\nand falls asleep.\r\n\r\nGiddiness prevails below stairs too. The very tall young man whose\r\nexcitement came on so soon, appears to have his head glued to the table\r\nin the pantry, and cannot be detached from it. A violent revulsion has\r\ntaken place in the spirits of Mrs Perch, who is low on account of Mr\r\nPerch, and tells cook that she fears he is not so much attached to his\r\nhome, as he used to be, when they were only nine in family. Mr\r\nTowlinson has a singing in his ears and a large wheel going round and\r\nround inside his head. The housemaid wishes it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wicked to wish\r\nthat one was dead.\r\n\r\nThere is a general delusion likewise, in these lower regions, on the\r\nsubject of time; everybody conceiving that it ought to be, at the\r\nearliest, ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, whereas it is not yet three in the\r\nafternoon. A shadowy idea of wickedness committed, haunts every\r\nindividual in the party; and each one secretly thinks the other a\r\ncompanion in guilt, whom it would be agreeable to avoid. No man or\r\nwoman has the hardihood to hint at the projected visit to the play.\r\nAnyone reviving the notion of the ball, would be scouted as a malignant\r\nidiot.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton sleeps upstairs, two hours afterwards, and naps are not yet\r\nover in the kitchen. The hatchments in the dining-room look down on\r\ncrumbs, dirty plates, spillings of wine, half-thawed ice, stale\r\ndiscoloured heel-taps, scraps of lobster, drumsticks of fowls, and\r\npensive jellies, gradually resolving themselves into a lukewarm gummy\r\nsoup. The marriage is, by this time, almost as denuded of its show and\r\ngarnish as the breakfast. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s servants moralise so much about\r\nit, and are so repentant over their early tea, at home, that by eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock or so, they settle down into confirmed seriousness; and Mr\r\nPerch, arriving at that time from the City, fresh and jocular, with a\r\nwhite waistcoat and a comic song, ready to spend the evening, and\r\nprepared for any amount of dissipation, is amazed to find himself\r\ncoldly received, and Mrs Perch but poorly, and to have the pleasing\r\nduty of escorting that lady home by the next omnibus.\r\n\r\nNight closes in. Florence, having rambled through the handsome house,\r\nfrom room to room, seeks her own chamber, where the care of Edith has\r\nsurrounded her with luxuries and comforts; and divesting herself of her\r\nhandsome dress, puts on her old simple mourning for dear Paul, and sits\r\ndown to read, with Diogenes winking and blinking on the ground beside\r\nher. But Florence cannot read tonight. The house seems strange and new,\r\nand there are loud echoes in it. There is a shadow on her heart: she\r\nknows not why or what: but it is heavy. Florence shuts her book, and\r\ngruff Diogenes, who takes that for a signal, puts his paws upon her\r\nlap, and rubs his ears against her caressing hands. But Florence cannot\r\nsee him plainly, in a little time, for there is a mist between her eyes\r\nand him, and her dead brother and dead mother shine in it like angels.\r\nWalter, too, poor wandering shipwrecked boy, oh, where is he?\r\n\r\nThe Major don\xe2\x80\x99t know; that\xe2\x80\x99s for certain; and don\xe2\x80\x99t care. The Major,\r\nhaving choked and slumbered, all the afternoon, has taken a late dinner\r\nat his club, and now sits over his pint of wine, driving a modest young\r\nman, with a fresh-coloured face, at the next table (who would give a\r\nhandsome sum to be able to rise and go away, but cannot do it) to the\r\nverge of madness, by anecdotes of Bagstock, Sir, at Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s wedding,\r\nand Old Joe\xe2\x80\x99s devilish gentle manly friend, Lord Feenix. While Cousin\r\nFeenix, who ought to be at Long\xe2\x80\x99s, and in bed, finds himself, instead,\r\nat a gaming-table, where his wilful legs have taken him, perhaps, in\r\nhis own despite.\r\n\r\nNight, like a giant, fills the church, from pavement to roof, and holds\r\ndominion through the silent hours. Pale dawn again comes peeping\r\nthrough the windows: and, giving place to day, sees night withdraw into\r\nthe vaults, and follows it, and drives it out, and hides among the\r\ndead. The timid mice again cower close together, when the great door\r\nclashes, and Mr Sownds and Mrs Miff treading the circle of their daily\r\nlives, unbroken as a marriage ring, come in. Again, the cocked hat and\r\nthe mortified bonnet stand in the background at the marriage hour; and\r\nagain this man taketh this woman, and this woman taketh this man, on\r\nthe solemn terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for\r\nricher for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,\r\nuntil death do them part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very words that Mr Carker rides into town repeating, with his mouth\r\nstretched to the utmost, as he picks his dainty way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nThe Wooden Midshipman goes to Pieces\r\n\r\n\r\nHonest Captain Cuttle, as the weeks flew over him in his fortified\r\nretreat, by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against\r\nsurprise, because of the non-appearance of the enemy. The Captain\r\nargued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to\r\nendure much longer; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter,\r\nthe weathercock was seldom nailed there; and he was too well acquainted\r\nwith the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger, to doubt\r\nthat that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery\r\nand capture. Trembling beneath the weight of these reasons, Captain\r\nCuttle lived a very close and retired life; seldom stirring abroad\r\nuntil after dark; venturing even then only into the obscurest streets;\r\nnever going forth at all on Sundays; and both within and without the\r\nwalls of his retreat, avoiding bonnets, as if they were worn by raging\r\nlions.\r\n\r\nThe Captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon\r\nby Mrs MacStinger, in his walks, it would be possible to offer\r\nresistance. He felt that it could not be done. He saw himself, in his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, put meekly in a hackney-coach, and carried off to his old\r\nlodgings. He foresaw that, once immured there, he was a lost man: his\r\nhat gone; Mrs MacStinger watchful of him day and night; reproaches\r\nheaped upon his head, before the infant family; himself the guilty\r\nobject of suspicion and distrust; an ogre in the children\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and\r\nin their mother\xe2\x80\x99s a detected traitor.\r\n\r\nA violent perspiration, and a lowness of spirits, always came over the\r\nCaptain as this gloomy picture presented itself to his imagination. It\r\ngenerally did so previous to his stealing out of doors at night for air\r\nand exercise. Sensible of the risk he ran, the Captain took leave of\r\nRob, at those times, with the solemnity which became a man who might\r\nnever return: exhorting him, in the event of his (the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s) being\r\nlost sight of, for a time, to tread in the paths of virtue, and keep\r\nthe brazen instruments well polished.\r\n\r\nBut not to throw away a chance; and to secure to himself a means, in\r\ncase of the worst, of holding communication with the external world;\r\nCaptain Cuttle soon conceived the happy idea of teaching Rob the\r\nGrinder some secret signal, by which that adherent might make his\r\npresence and fidelity known to his commander, in the hour of adversity.\r\nAfter much cogitation, the Captain decided in favour of instructing him\r\nto whistle the marine melody, \xe2\x80\x9cOh cheerily, cheerily!\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob the\r\nGrinder attaining a point as near perfection in that accomplishment as\r\na landsman could hope to reach, the Captain impressed these mysterious\r\ninstructions on his mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lad, stand by! If ever I\xe2\x80\x99m took\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTook, Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Rob, with his round eyes wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle darkly, \xe2\x80\x9cif ever I goes away, meaning to come\r\nback to supper, and don\xe2\x80\x99t come within hail again, twenty-four hours\r\narter my loss, go you to Brig Place and whistle that \xe2\x80\x9cere tune near my\r\nold moorings\xe2\x80\x94not as if you was a meaning of it, you understand, but as\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d drifted there, promiscuous. If I answer in that tune, you\r\nsheer off, my lad, and come back four-and-twenty hours arterwards; if I\r\nanswer in another tune, do you stand off and on, and wait till I throw\r\nout further signals. Do you understand them orders, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to stand off and on of, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nhorse-road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a smart lad for you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain eyeing him sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know his own native alphabet! Go away a bit and come back again\r\nalternate\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good my lad, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, relenting. \xe2\x80\x9cDo it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat he might do it the better, Captain Cuttle sometimes condescended,\r\nof an evening after the shop was shut, to rehearse this scene: retiring\r\ninto the parlour for the purpose, as into the lodgings of a\r\nsupposititious MacStinger, and carefully observing the behaviour of his\r\nally, from the hole of espial he had cut in the wall. Rob the Grinder\r\ndischarged himself of his duty with so much exactness and judgment,\r\nwhen thus put to the proof, that the Captain presented him, at divers\r\ntimes, with seven sixpences, in token of satisfaction; and gradually\r\nfelt stealing over his spirit the resignation of a man who had made\r\nprovision for the worst, and taken every reasonable precaution against\r\nan unrelenting fate.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Captain did not tempt ill-fortune, by being a whit\r\nmore venturesome than before. Though he considered it a point of good\r\nbreeding in himself, as a general friend of the family, to attend Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s wedding (of which he had heard from Mr Perch), and to show\r\nthat gentleman a pleasant and approving countenance from the gallery,\r\nhe had repaired to the church in a hackney cabriolet with both windows\r\nup; and might have scrupled even to make that venture, in his dread of\r\nMrs MacStinger, but that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s attendance on the ministry of the\r\nReverend Melchisedech rendered it peculiarly unlikely that she would be\r\nfound in communion with the Establishment.\r\n\r\nThe Captain got safe home again, and fell into the ordinary routine of\r\nhis new life, without encountering any more direct alarm from the\r\nenemy, than was suggested to him by the daily bonnets in the street.\r\nBut other subjects began to lay heavy on the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nship was still unheard of. No news came of old Sol Gills. Florence did\r\nnot even know of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, and Captain Cuttle had\r\nnot the heart to tell her. Indeed the Captain, as his own hopes of the\r\ngenerous, handsome, gallant-hearted youth, whom he had loved, according\r\nto his rough manner, from a child, began to fade, and faded more and\r\nmore from day to day, shrunk with instinctive pain from the thought of\r\nexchanging a word with Florence. If he had had good news to carry to\r\nher, the honest Captain would have braved the newly decorated house and\r\nsplendid furniture\xe2\x80\x94though these, connected with the lady he had seen at\r\nchurch, were awful to him\xe2\x80\x94and made his way into her presence. With a\r\ndark horizon gathering around their common hopes, however, that\r\ndarkened every hour, the Captain almost felt as if he were a new\r\nmisfortune and affliction to her; and was scarcely less afraid of a\r\nvisit from Florence, than from Mrs MacStinger herself.\r\n\r\nIt was a chill dark autumn evening, and Captain Cuttle had ordered a\r\nfire to be kindled in the little back parlour, now more than ever like\r\nthe cabin of a ship. The rain fell fast, and the wind blew hard; and\r\nstraying out on the house-top by that stormy bedroom of his old friend,\r\nto take an observation of the weather, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s heart died within\r\nhim, when he saw how wild and desolate it was. Not that he associated\r\nthe weather of that time with poor Walter\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, or doubted that if\r\nProvidence had doomed him to be lost and shipwrecked, it was over, long\r\nago; but that beneath an outward influence, quite distinct from the\r\nsubject-matter of his thoughts, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s spirits sank, and his\r\nhopes turned pale, as those of wiser men had often done before him, and\r\nwill often do again.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, addressing his face to the sharp wind and slanting\r\nrain, looked up at the heavy scud that was flying fast over the\r\nwilderness of house-tops, and looked for something cheery there in\r\nvain. The prospect near at hand was no better. In sundry tea-chests and\r\nother rough boxes at his feet, the pigeons of Rob the Grinder were\r\ncooing like so many dismal breezes getting up. A crazy weathercock of a\r\nmidshipman, with a telescope at his eye, once visible from the street,\r\nbut long bricked out, creaked and complained upon his rusty pivot as\r\nthe shrill blast spun him round and round, and sported with him\r\ncruelly. Upon the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s coarse blue vest the cold raindrops started\r\nlike steel beads; and he could hardly maintain himself aslant against\r\nthe stiff Nor\xe2\x80\x99-Wester that came pressing against him, importunate to\r\ntopple him over the parapet, and throw him on the pavement below. If\r\nthere were any Hope alive that evening, the Captain thought, as he held\r\nhis hat on, it certainly kept house, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t out of doors; so the\r\nCaptain, shaking his head in a despondent manner, went in to look for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle descended slowly to the little back parlour, and, seated\r\nin his accustomed chair, looked for it in the fire; but it was not\r\nthere, though the fire was bright. He took out his tobacco-box and\r\npipe, and composing himself to smoke, looked for it in the red glow\r\nfrom the bowl, and in the wreaths of vapour that curled upward from his\r\nlips; but there was not so much as an atom of the rust of Hope\xe2\x80\x99s anchor\r\nin either. He tried a glass of grog; but melancholy truth was at the\r\nbottom of that well, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish it. He made a turn or two\r\nin the shop, and looked for Hope among the instruments; but they\r\nobstinately worked out reckonings for the missing ship, in spite of any\r\nopposition he could offer, that ended at the bottom of the lone sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind still rushing, and the rain still pattering, against the\r\nclosed shutters, the Captain brought to before the wooden Midshipman\r\nupon the counter, and thought, as he dried the little officer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform\r\nwith his sleeve, how many years the Midshipman had seen, during which\r\nfew changes\xe2\x80\x94hardly any\xe2\x80\x94had transpired among his ship\xe2\x80\x99s company; how the\r\nchanges had come all together, one day, as it might be; and of what a\r\nsweeping kind they were. Here was the little society of the back\r\nparlour broken up, and scattered far and wide. Here was no audience for\r\nLovely Peg, even if there had been anybody to sing it, which there was\r\nnot; for the Captain was as morally certain that nobody but he could\r\nexecute that ballad, as he was that he had not the spirit, under\r\nexisting circumstances, to attempt it. There was no bright face of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x9d in the house;\xe2\x80\x94here the Captain transferred his sleeve for a\r\nmoment from the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s uniform to his own cheek;\xe2\x80\x94the familiar wig\r\nand buttons of Sol Gills were a vision of the past; Richard Whittington\r\nwas knocked on the head; and every plan and project in connexion with\r\nthe Midshipman, lay drifting, without mast or rudder, on the waste of\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nAs the Captain, with a dejected face, stood revolving these thoughts,\r\nand polishing the Midshipman, partly in the tenderness of old\r\nacquaintance, and partly in the absence of his mind, a knocking at the\r\nshop-door communicated a frightful start to the frame of Rob the\r\nGrinder, seated on the counter, whose large eyes had been intently\r\nfixed on the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face, and who had been debating within himself,\r\nfor the five hundredth time, whether the Captain could have done a\r\nmurder, that he had such an evil conscience, and was always running\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody\xe2\x80\x99s knuckles, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob the Grinder.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, with an abashed and guilty air, immediately walked on\r\ntiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in. Rob, opening the\r\ndoor, would have parleyed with the visitor on the threshold if the\r\nvisitor had come in female guise; but the figure being of the male sex,\r\nand Rob\xe2\x80\x99s orders only applying to women, Rob held the door open and\r\nallowed it to enter: which it did very quickly, glad to get out of the\r\ndriving rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA job for Burgess and Co. at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, looking over\r\nhis shoulder compassionately at his own legs, which were very wet and\r\ncovered with splashes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how-de-do, Mr Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe salutation was addressed to the Captain, now emerging from the back\r\nparlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of\r\ncoming out by accidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee,\xe2\x80\x9d the gentleman went on to say in the same breath; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\nwell indeed, myself, I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you. My name is Toots,\xe2\x80\x94Mister\r\nToots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the\r\nwedding, and made him a bow. Mr Toots replied with a chuckle; and being\r\nembarrassed, as he generally was, breathed hard, shook hands with the\r\nCaptain for a long time, and then falling on Rob the Grinder, in the\r\nabsence of any other resource, shook hands with him in a most\r\naffectionate and cordial manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! I should like to speak a word to you, Mr Gills, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Toots at length, with surprising presence of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI say! Miss\r\nD.O.M. you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, with responsive gravity and mystery, immediately waved his\r\nhook towards the little parlour, whither Mr Toots followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg your pardon though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, looking up in the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s face as he sat down in a chair by the fire, which the Captain\r\nplaced for him; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to know the Chicken at all; do you,\r\nMr Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Chicken?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Game Chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nThe Captain shaking his head, Mr Toots explained that the man alluded\r\nto was the celebrated public character who had covered himself and his\r\ncountry with glory in his contest with the Nobby Shropshire One; but\r\nthis piece of information did not appear to enlighten the Captain very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he\xe2\x80\x99s outside: that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s of no\r\nconsequence; he won\xe2\x80\x99t get very wet, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can pass the word for him in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you would have the goodness to let him sit in the shop with\r\nyour young man,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad; because, you\r\nknow, he\xe2\x80\x99s easily offended, and the damp\xe2\x80\x99s rather bad for his stamina.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call him in, Mr Gills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith that, Mr Toots repairing to the shop-door, sent a peculiar whistle\r\ninto the night, which produced a stoical gentleman in a shaggy white\r\ngreat-coat and a flat-brimmed hat, with very short hair, a broken nose,\r\nand a considerable tract of bare and sterile country behind each ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nThe compliant Chicken spat out some small pieces of straw on which he\r\nwas regaling himself, and took in a fresh supply from a reserve he\r\ncarried in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no drain of nothing short handy, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nChicken, generally. \xe2\x80\x9cThis here sluicing night is hard lines to a man as\r\nlives on his condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle proffered a glass of rum, which the Chicken, throwing\r\nback his head, emptied into himself, as into a cask, after proposing\r\nthe brief sentiment, \xe2\x80\x9cTowards us!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots and the Captain returning\r\nthen to the parlour, and taking their seats before the fire, Mr Toots\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Gills\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwast!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Cuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots looked greatly disconcerted, while the Captain proceeded\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle is my name, and England is my nation, this here is my\r\ndwelling-place, and blessed be creation\xe2\x80\x94Job,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, as an\r\nindex to his authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see Mr Gills, could I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could see Sol Gills, young gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nimpressively, and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s knee, \xe2\x80\x9cold Sol,\r\nmind you\xe2\x80\x94with your own eyes\xe2\x80\x94as you sit there\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d be welcomer to me,\r\nthan a wind astern, to a ship becalmed. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t see Sol Gills.\r\nAnd why can\xe2\x80\x99t you see Sol Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, apprised by the\r\nface of Mr Toots that he was making a profound impression on that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause he\xe2\x80\x99s inwisible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots in his agitation was going to reply that it was of no\r\nconsequence at all. But he corrected himself, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLor bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9chas left me in charge here by a\r\npiece of writing, but though he was a\xe2\x80\x99most as good as my sworn brother,\r\nI know no more where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, or why he\xe2\x80\x99s gone; if so be to seek his\r\nnevy, or if so be along of being not quite settled in his mind; than\r\nyou do. One morning at daybreak, he went over the side,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a splash, without a ripple I have looked for that man\r\nhigh and low, and never set eyes, nor ears, nor nothing else, upon him\r\nfrom that hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, good Gracious, Miss Dombey don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I ask you, as a feeling heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, dropping his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should she know? why should she be made to know, until such\r\ntime as there wam\xe2\x80\x99t any help for it? She took to old Sol Gills, did\r\nthat sweet creetur, with a kindness, with a affability, with a\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe good of saying so? you know her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Mr Toots, with a conscious blush that\r\nsuffused his whole countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you come here from her?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all I need observe, is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you know a\r\nangel, and are chartered a angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots instantly seized the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and requested the favour\r\nof his friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word and honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very\r\nmuch obliged to you if you\xe2\x80\x99d improve my acquaintance. I should like to\r\nknow you, Captain, very much. I really am in want of a friend, I am.\r\nLittle Dombey was my friend at old Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, and would have been now,\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d have lived. The Chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, in a forlorn whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis very well\xe2\x80\x94admirable in his way\xe2\x80\x94the sharpest man perhaps in the\r\nworld; there\xe2\x80\x99s not a move he isn\xe2\x80\x99t up to, everybody says so\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s not everything. So she is an angel, Captain. If there is an\r\nangel anywhere, it\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Dombey. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said. Really\r\nthough, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very much obliged to you\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d cultivate my acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle received this proposal in a polite manner, but still\r\nwithout committing himself to its acceptance; merely observing, \xe2\x80\x9cAy,\r\nay, my lad. We shall see, we shall see;\xe2\x80\x9d and reminding Mr Toots of his\r\nimmediate mission, by inquiring to what he was indebted for the honour\r\nof that visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s the young woman I come\r\nfrom. Not Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x94Susan, you know.\r\n\r\nThe Captain nodded his head once, with a grave expression of face\r\nindicative of his regarding that young woman with serious respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it happens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I go and\r\ncall sometimes, on Miss Dombey. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go there on purpose, you know,\r\nbut I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often; and when I find\r\nmyself there, why\xe2\x80\x94why I call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xe2\x80\x99rally,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI called this afternoon. Upon my word and\r\nhonour, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to form an idea of the angel Miss\r\nDombey was this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain answered with a jerk of his head, implying that it might\r\nnot be easy to some people, but was quite so to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was coming out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthe young woman, in the most\r\nunexpected manner, took me into the pantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain seemed, for the moment, to object to this proceeding; and\r\nleaning back in his chair, looked at Mr Toots with a distrustful, if\r\nnot threatening visage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere she brought out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthis newspaper. She told me\r\nthat she had kept it from Miss Dombey all day, on account of something\r\nthat was in it, about somebody that she and Dombey used to know; and\r\nthen she read the passage to me. Very well. Then she said\xe2\x80\x94wait a\r\nminute; what was it she said, though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots, endeavouring to concentrate his mental powers on this\r\nquestion, unintentionally fixed the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and was so much\r\ndiscomposed by its stern expression, that his difficulty in resuming\r\nthe thread of his subject was enhanced to a painful extent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots after long consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah! Yes! She said\r\nthat she hoped there was a bare possibility that it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be true;\r\nand that as she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very well come out herself, without surprising\r\nMiss Dombey, would I go down to Mr Solomon Gills the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin this street, who was the party\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle, and ask whether he believed\r\nit was true, or had heard anything else in the City. She said, if he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me, no doubt Captain Cuttle could. By the bye!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Toots, as the discovery flashed upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain glanced at the newspaper in Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and breathed\r\nshort and hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthe reason why I\xe2\x80\x99m rather late is, because I\r\nwent up as far as Finchley first, to get some uncommonly fine chickweed\r\nthat grows there, for Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s bird. But I came on here, directly\r\nafterwards. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the paper, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who had become cautious of reading the news, lest he\r\nshould find himself advertised at full length by Mrs MacStinger, shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I read the passage to you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nThe Captain making a sign in the affirmative, Mr Toots read as follows,\r\nfrom the Shipping Intelligence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Southampton. The barque Defiance, Henry James, Commander, arrived in\r\nthis port today, with a cargo of sugar, coffee, and rum, reports that\r\nbeing becalmed on the sixth day of her passage home from Jamaica,\r\nin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94in such and such a latitude, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, after making\r\na feeble dash at the figures, and tumbling over them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, striking his clenched hand on the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeave ahead, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94latitude,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Toots, with a startled glance at the Captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand longitude so-and-so,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98the look-out observed, half an hour before\r\nsunset, some fragments of a wreck, drifting at about the distance of a\r\nmile. The weather being clear, and the barque making no way, a boat was\r\nhoisted out, with orders to inspect the same, when they were found to\r\nconsist of sundry large spars, and a part of the main rigging of an\r\nEnglish brig, of about five hundred tons burden, together with a\r\nportion of the stem on which the words and letters \xe2\x80\x9cSon and H-\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nyet plainly legible. No vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon\r\nthe floating fragments. Log of the Defiance states, that a breeze\r\nspringing up in the night, the wreck was seen no more. There can be no\r\ndoubt that all surmises as to the fate of the missing vessel, the Son\r\nand Heir, port of London, bound for Barbados, are now set at rest for\r\never; that she broke up in the last hurricane; and that every soul on\r\nboard perished.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, like all mankind, little knew how much hope had\r\nsurvived within him under discouragement, until he felt its\r\ndeath-shock. During the reading of the paragraph, and for a minute or\r\ntwo afterwards, he sat with his gaze fixed on the modest Mr Toots, like\r\na man entranced; then, suddenly rising, and putting on his glazed hat,\r\nwhich, in his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s honour, he had laid upon the table, the Captain\r\nturned his back, and bent his head down on the little chimneypiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d upon my word and honour,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Toots, whose tender heart was\r\nmoved by the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected distress, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a most wretched\r\nsort of affair this world is! Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s always dying, or going and\r\ndoing something uncomfortable in it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I never should have\r\nlooked forward so much, to coming into my property, if I had known\r\nthis. I never saw such a world. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal worse than\r\nBlimber\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, without altering his position, signed to Mr Toots not\r\nto mind him; and presently turned round, with his glazed hat thrust\r\nback upon his ears, and his hand composing and smoothing his brown\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my dear lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cfarewell! Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr my child, my\r\nboy, and man, I loved you! He warn\xe2\x80\x99t my flesh and blood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, looking at the fire\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t got none\xe2\x80\x94but something of what a\r\nfather feels when he loses a son, I feel in losing Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. For why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it ain\xe2\x80\x99t one loss, but a round dozen.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that there young school-boy with the rosy face and curly hair,\r\nthat used to be as merry in this here parlour, come round every week,\r\nas a piece of music? Gone down with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. Where\xe2\x80\x99s that there fresh\r\nlad, that nothing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tire nor put out, and that sparkled up and\r\nblushed so, when we joked him about Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight, that he was\r\nbeautiful to look at? Gone down with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. Where\xe2\x80\x99s that there man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirit, all afire, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the old man hove down for a\r\nminute, and cared nothing for itself? Gone down with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\none Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. There was a dozen Wal\xe2\x80\x9drs that I know\xe2\x80\x99d and loved, all\r\nholding round his neck when he went down, and they\xe2\x80\x99re a-holding round\r\nmine now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots sat silent: folding and refolding the newspaper as small as\r\npossible upon his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Sol Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, gazing at the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cpoor nevyless\r\nold Sol, where are you got to! you was left in charge of me; his last\r\nwords was, \xe2\x80\x98Take care of my Uncle!\xe2\x80\x99 What came over you, Sol, when you\r\nwent and gave the go-bye to Ned Cuttle; and what am I to put in my\r\naccounts that he\xe2\x80\x99s a looking down upon, respecting you! Sol Gills, Sol\r\nGills!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, shaking his head slowly, \xe2\x80\x9ccatch sight of that\r\nthere newspaper, away from home, with no one as know\xe2\x80\x99d Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr by, to say\r\na word; and broadside to you broach, and down you pitch, head\r\nforemost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrawing a heavy sigh, the Captain turned to Mr Toots, and roused\r\nhimself to a sustained consciousness of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must tell the young woman honestly\r\nthat this here fatal news is too correct. They don\xe2\x80\x99t romance, you see,\r\non such pints. It\xe2\x80\x99s entered on the ship\xe2\x80\x99s log, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truest\r\nbook as a man can write. To-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstep out and make inquiries; but they\xe2\x80\x99ll lead to no good. They can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me a look-in in the forenoon, you shall know what I\r\nhave heerd; but tell the young woman from Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover. Over!\xe2\x80\x9d And the Captain, hooking off his glazed hat, pulled his\r\nhandkerchief out of the crown, wiped his grizzled head despairingly,\r\nand tossed the handkerchief in again, with the indifference of deep\r\ndejection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9creally I am dreadfully sorry. Upon\r\nmy word I am, though I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t acquainted with the party. Do you think\r\nMiss Dombey will be very much affected, Captain Gills\xe2\x80\x94I mean Mr\r\nCuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lord love you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, with something of\r\ncompassion for Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s innocence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she warn\xe2\x80\x99t no higher than\r\nthat, they were as fond of one another as two young doves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they though!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with a considerably lengthened face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were made for one another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, mournfully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhat signifies that now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word and honour,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Toots, blurting out his words\r\nthrough a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\neven more sorry than I was before. You know, Captain Gills, I\xe2\x80\x94I\r\npositively adore Miss Dombey;\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I am perfectly sore with loving her;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe burst with which this confession forced itself out of the unhappy\r\nMr Toots, bespoke the vehemence of his feelings; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what would be the\r\ngood of my regarding her in this manner, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t truly sorry for\r\nher feeling pain, whatever was the cause of it. Mine ain\xe2\x80\x99t a selfish\r\naffection, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, in the confidence engendered by\r\nhis having been a witness of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the sort\r\nof thing with me, Captain Gills, that if I could be run over\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94or\r\ntrampled upon\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94or thrown off a very high place-or anything of that\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94for Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s sake, it would be the most delightful thing that\r\ncould happen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this, Mr Toots said in a suppressed voice, to prevent its reaching\r\nthe jealous ears of the Chicken, who objected to the softer emotions;\r\nwhich effort of restraint, coupled with the intensity of his feelings,\r\nmade him red to the tips of his ears, and caused him to present such an\r\naffecting spectacle of disinterested love to the eyes of Captain\r\nCuttle, that the good Captain patted him consolingly on the back, and\r\nbade him cheer up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s kind of you, in the\r\nmidst of your own troubles, to say so. I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you. As\r\nI said before, I really want a friend, and should be glad to have your\r\nacquaintance. Although I am very well off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with energy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t think what a miserable Beast I am. The hollow crowd, you\r\nknow, when they see me with the Chicken, and characters of distinction\r\nlike that, suppose me to be happy; but I\xe2\x80\x99m wretched. I suffer for Miss\r\nDombey, Captain Gills. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get through my meals; I have no pleasure\r\nin my tailor; I often cry when I\xe2\x80\x99m alone. I assure you it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nsatisfaction to me to come back to-morrow, or to come back fifty\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots, with these words, shook the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and disguising\r\nsuch traces of his agitation as could be disguised on so short a\r\nnotice, before the Chicken\xe2\x80\x99s penetrating glance, rejoined that eminent\r\ngentleman in the shop. The Chicken, who was apt to be jealous of his\r\nascendancy, eyed Captain Cuttle with anything but favour as he took\r\nleave of Mr Toots, but followed his patron without being otherwise\r\ndemonstrative of his ill-will: leaving the Captain oppressed with\r\nsorrow; and Rob the Grinder elevated with joy, on account of having had\r\nthe honour of staring for nearly half an hour at the conqueror of the\r\nNobby Shropshire One.\r\n\r\nLong after Rob was fast asleep in his bed under the counter, the\r\nCaptain sat looking at the fire; and long after there was no fire to\r\nlook at, the Captain sat gazing on the rusty bars, with unavailing\r\nthoughts of Walter and old Sol crowding through his mind. Retirement to\r\nthe stormy chamber at the top of the house brought no rest with it; and\r\nthe Captain rose up in the morning, sorrowful and unrefreshed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the City offices were opened, the Captain issued forth to\r\nthe counting-house of Dombey and Son. But there was no opening of the\r\nMidshipman\xe2\x80\x99s windows that morning. Rob the Grinder, by the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders, left the shutters closed, and the house was as a house of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that Mr Carker was entering the office, as Captain Cuttle\r\narrived at the door. Receiving the Manager\xe2\x80\x99s benison gravely and\r\nsilently, Captain Cuttle made bold to accompany him into his own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, taking up his usual position\r\nbefore the fireplace, and keeping on his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a bad business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have received the news as was in print yesterday, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have received it! It was accurately stated.\r\nThe underwriters suffer a considerable loss. We are very sorry. No\r\nhelp! Such is life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker pared his nails delicately with a penknife, and smiled at the\r\nCaptain, who was standing by the door looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI excessively regret poor Gay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cand the crew. I\r\nunderstand there were some of our very best men among \xe2\x80\x99em. It always\r\nhappens so. Many men with families too. A comfort to reflect that poor\r\nGay had no family, Captain Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain stood rubbing his chin, and looking at the Manager. The\r\nManager glanced at the unopened letters lying on his desk, and took up\r\nthe newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything I can do for you, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked looking\r\noff it, with a smiling and expressive glance at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could set my mind at rest, Sir, on something it\xe2\x80\x99s uneasy\r\nabout,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Manager, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? Come, Captain Cuttle, I must\r\ntrouble you to be quick, if you please. I am much engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, advancing a step. \xe2\x80\x9cAfore my\r\nfriend Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr went on this here disastrous voyage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the smiling Manager, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk about disastrous voyages in that way. We have nothing to do with\r\ndisastrous voyages here, my good fellow. You must have begun very early\r\non your day\xe2\x80\x99s allowance, Captain, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that there are\r\nhazards in all voyages, whether by sea or land. You are not made uneasy\r\nby the supposition that young what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name was lost in bad weather\r\nthat was got up against him in these offices\xe2\x80\x94are you? Fie, Captain!\r\nSleep, and soda-water, are the best cures for such uneasiness as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, slowly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are a\xe2\x80\x99most a lad to me, and\r\nso I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask your pardon for that slip of a word,\xe2\x80\x94if you find any\r\npleasure in this here sport, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t the gentleman I took you for.\r\nAnd if you ain\xe2\x80\x99t the gentleman I took you for, may be my mind has call\r\nto be uneasy. Now this is what it is, Mr Carker.\xe2\x80\x94Afore that poor lad\r\nwent away, according to orders, he told me that he warn\xe2\x80\x99t a going away\r\nfor his own good, or for promotion, he know\xe2\x80\x99d. It was my belief that he\r\nwas wrong, and I told him so, and I come here, your head governor being\r\nabsent, to ask a question or two of you in a civil way, for my own\r\nsatisfaction. Them questions you answered\xe2\x80\x94free. Now it\xe2\x80\x99ll ease my mind\r\nto know, when all is over, as it is, and when what can\xe2\x80\x99t be cured must\r\nbe endoored\xe2\x80\x94for which, as a scholar, you\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul the book it\xe2\x80\x99s in,\r\nand thereof make a note\xe2\x80\x94to know once more, in a word, that I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmistaken; that I warn\xe2\x80\x99t back\xe2\x80\x99ard in my duty when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the old\r\nman what Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr told me; and that the wind was truly in his sail, when\r\nhe highsted of it for Barbados Harbour. Mr Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nin the goodness of his nature, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was here last, we was very\r\npleasant together. If I ain\xe2\x80\x99t been altogether so pleasant myself this\r\nmorning, on account of this poor lad, and if I have chafed again any\r\nobservation of yours that I might have fended off, my name is Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard\r\nCuttle, and I ask your pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Manager, with all possible politeness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask you to do me a favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have the goodness to walk off, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the\r\nManager, stretching forth his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cand to carry your jargon somewhere\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery knob in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face turned white with astonishment and\r\nindignation; even the red rim on his forehead faded, like a rainbow\r\namong the gathering clouds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, shaking his\r\nforefinger at him, and showing him all his teeth, but still amiably\r\nsmiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI was much too lenient with you when you came here before.\r\nYou belong to an artful and audacious set of people. In my desire to\r\nsave young what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name from being kicked out of this place, neck\r\nand crop, my good Captain, I tolerated you; but for once, and only\r\nonce. Now, go, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was absolutely rooted to the ground, and speechless\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-humoured Manager, gathering up his skirts, and\r\nstanding astride upon the hearth-rug, \xe2\x80\x9clike a sensible fellow, and let\r\nus have no turning out, or any such violent measures. If Mr Dombey were\r\nhere, Captain, you might be obliged to leave in a more ignominious\r\nmanner, possibly. I merely say, Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, laying his ponderous hand upon his chest, to assist\r\nhimself in fetching a deep breath, looked at Mr Carker from head to\r\nfoot, and looked round the little room, as if he did not clearly\r\nunderstand where he was, or in what company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are deep, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Carker, with the easy and\r\nvivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well\r\nto be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing, when it did not immediately\r\nconcern himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are not quite out of soundings,\r\neither\xe2\x80\x94neither you nor your absent friend, Captain. What have you done\r\nwith your absent friend, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Captain laid his hand upon his chest. After drawing another\r\ndeep breath, he conjured himself to \xe2\x80\x9cstand by!\xe2\x80\x9d But in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hatch nice little plots, and hold nice little councils, and make\r\nnice little appointments, and receive nice little visitors, too,\r\nCaptain, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, bending his brows upon him, without showing\r\nhis teeth any the less: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s a bold measure to come here\r\nafterwards. Not like your discretion! You conspirators, and hiders, and\r\nrunners-away, should know better than that. Will you oblige me by\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the Captain, in a choked and trembling voice, and with\r\na curious action going on in the ponderous fist; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a many words\r\nI could wish to say to you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know where they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nstowed just at present. My young friend, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, was drownded only last\r\nnight, according to my reckoning, and it puts me out, you see. But you\r\nand me will come alongside o\xe2\x80\x99one another again, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, holding up his hook, \xe2\x80\x9cif we live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be anything but shrewd in you, my good fellow, if we do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the Manager, with the same frankness; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you may rely, I\r\ngive you fair warning, upon my detecting and exposing you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend to be a more moral man than my neighbours, my good Captain; but\r\nthe confidence of this House, or of any member of this House, is not to\r\nbe abused and undermined while I have eyes and ears. Good day!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nCarker, nodding his head.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, looking at him steadily (Mr Carker looked full as\r\nsteadily at the Captain), went out of the office and left him standing\r\nastride before the fire, as calm and pleasant as if there were no more\r\nspots upon his soul than on his pure white linen, and his smooth sleek\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe Captain glanced, in passing through the outer counting-house, at\r\nthe desk where he knew poor Walter had been used to sit, now occupied\r\nby another young boy, with a face almost as fresh and hopeful as his on\r\nthe day when they tapped the famous last bottle but one of the old\r\nMadeira, in the little back parlour. The nation of ideas, thus\r\nawakened, did the Captain a great deal of good; it softened him in the\r\nvery height of his anger, and brought the tears into his eyes.\r\n\r\nArrived at the wooden Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s again, and sitting down in a corner\r\nof the dark shop, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s indignation, strong as it was, could\r\nmake no head against his grief. Passion seemed not only to do wrong and\r\nviolence to the memory of the dead, but to be infected by death, and to\r\ndroop and decline beside it. All the living knaves and liars in the\r\nworld, were nothing to the honesty and truth of one dead friend.\r\n\r\nThe only thing the honest Captain made out clearly, in this state of\r\nmind, besides the loss of Walter, was, that with him almost the whole\r\nworld of Captain Cuttle had been drowned. If he reproached himself\r\nsometimes, and keenly too, for having ever connived at Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnocent deceit, he thought at least as often of the Mr Carker whom no\r\nsea could ever render up; and the Mr Dombey, whom he now began to\r\nperceive was as far beyond human recall; and the \xe2\x80\x9cHeart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith whom he must never foregather again; and the Lovely Peg, that\r\nteak-built and trim ballad, that had gone ashore upon a rock, and split\r\ninto mere planks and beams of rhyme. The Captain sat in the dark shop,\r\nthinking of these things, to the entire exclusion of his own injury;\r\nand looking with as sad an eye upon the ground, as if in contemplation\r\nof their actual fragments, as they floated past.\r\n\r\nBut the Captain was not unmindful, for all that, of such decent and\r\nrest observances in memory of poor Walter, as he felt within his power.\r\nRousing himself, and rousing Rob the Grinder (who in the unnatural\r\ntwilight was fast asleep), the Captain sallied forth with his attendant\r\nat his heels, and the door-key in his pocket, and repairing to one of\r\nthose convenient slop-selling establishments of which there is abundant\r\nchoice at the eastern end of London, purchased on the spot two suits of\r\nmourning\xe2\x80\x94one for Rob the Grinder, which was immensely too small, and\r\none for himself, which was immensely too large. He also provided Rob\r\nwith a species of hat, greatly to be admired for its symmetry and\r\nusefulness, as well as for a happy blending of the mariner with the\r\ncoal-heaver; which is usually termed a sou\xe2\x80\x99wester; and which was\r\nsomething of a novelty in connexion with the instrument business. In\r\ntheir several garments, which the vendor declared to be such a miracle\r\nin point of fit as nothing but a rare combination of fortuitous\r\ncircumstances ever brought about, and the fashion of which was\r\nunparalleled within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, the Captain\r\nand Grinder immediately arrayed themselves: presenting a spectacle\r\nfraught with wonder to all who beheld it.\r\n\r\nIn this altered form, the Captain received Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m took aback,\r\nmy lad, at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand will only confirm that\r\nthere ill news. Tell the young woman to break it gentle to the young\r\nlady, and for neither of \xe2\x80\x99em never to think of me no more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cspecial,\r\nmind you, that is\xe2\x80\x94though I will think of them, when night comes on a\r\nhurricane and seas is mountains rowling, for which overhaul your Doctor\r\nWatts, brother, and when found make a note on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain reserved, until some fitter time, the consideration of Mr\r\nToots\xe2\x80\x99s offer of friendship, and thus dismissed him. Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits were so low, in truth, that he half determined, that day, to\r\ntake no further precautions against surprise from Mrs MacStinger, but\r\nto abandon himself recklessly to chance, and be indifferent to what\r\nmight happen. As evening came on, he fell into a better frame of mind,\r\nhowever; and spoke much of Walter to Rob the Grinder, whose attention\r\nand fidelity he likewise incidentally commended. Rob did not blush to\r\nhear the Captain earnest in his praises, but sat staring at him, and\r\naffecting to snivel with sympathy, and making a feint of being\r\nvirtuous, and treasuring up every word he said (like a young spy as he\r\nwas) with very promising deceit.\r\n\r\nWhen Rob had turned in, and was fast asleep, the Captain trimmed the\r\ncandle, put on his spectacles\xe2\x80\x94he had felt it appropriate to take to\r\nspectacles on entering into the Instrument Trade, though his eyes were\r\nlike a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and opened the prayer-book at the Burial Service. And\r\nreading softly to himself, in the little back parlour, and stopping now\r\nand then to wipe his eyes, the Captain, in a true and simple spirit,\r\ncommitted Walter\xe2\x80\x99s body to the deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nContrasts\r\n\r\n\r\nTurn we our eyes upon two homes; not lying side by side, but wide\r\napart, though both within easy range and reach of the great city of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe first is situated in the green and wooded country near Norwood. It\r\nis not a mansion; it is of no pretensions as to size; but it is\r\nbeautifully arranged, and tastefully kept. The lawn, the soft, smooth\r\nslope, the flower-garden, the clumps of trees where graceful forms of\r\nash and willow are not wanting, the conservatory, the rustic verandah\r\nwith sweet-smelling creeping plants entwined about the pillars, the\r\nsimple exterior of the house, the well-ordered offices, though all upon\r\nthe diminutive scale proper to a mere cottage, bespeak an amount of\r\nelegant comfort within, that might serve for a palace. This indication\r\nis not without warrant; for, within, it is a house of refinement and\r\nluxury. Rich colours, excellently blended, meet the eye at every turn;\r\nin the furniture\xe2\x80\x94its proportions admirably devised to suit the shapes\r\nand sizes of the small rooms; on the walls; upon the floors; tingeing\r\nand subduing the light that comes in through the odd glass doors and\r\nwindows here and there. There are a few choice prints and pictures too;\r\nin quaint nooks and recesses there is no want of books; and there are\r\ngames of skill and chance set forth on tables\xe2\x80\x94fantastic chessmen, dice,\r\nbackgammon, cards, and billiards.\r\n\r\nAnd yet amidst this opulence of comfort, there is something in the\r\ngeneral air that is not well. Is it that the carpets and the cushions\r\nare too soft and noiseless, so that those who move or repose among them\r\nseem to act by stealth? Is it that the prints and pictures do not\r\ncommemorate great thoughts or deeds, or render nature in the Poetry of\r\nlandscape, hall, or hut, but are of one voluptuous cast\xe2\x80\x94mere shows of\r\nform and colour\xe2\x80\x94and no more? Is it that the books have all their gold\r\noutside, and that the titles of the greater part qualify them to be\r\ncompanions of the prints and pictures? Is it that the completeness and\r\nthe beauty of the place are here and there belied by an affectation of\r\nhumility, in some unimportant and inexpensive regard, which is as false\r\nas the face of the too truly painted portrait hanging yonder, or its\r\noriginal at breakfast in his easy chair below it? Or is it that, with\r\nthe daily breath of that original and master of all here, there issues\r\nforth some subtle portion of himself, which gives a vague expression of\r\nhimself to everything about him?\r\n\r\nIt is Mr Carker the Manager who sits in the easy chair. A gaudy parrot\r\nin a burnished cage upon the table tears at the wires with her beak,\r\nand goes walking, upside down, in its dome-top, shaking her house and\r\nscreeching; but Mr Carker is indifferent to the bird, and looks with a\r\nmusing smile at a picture on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most extraordinary accidental likeness, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a Juno; perhaps a Potiphar\xe2\x80\x99s Wife\xe2\x80\x9d; perhaps some scornful\r\nNymph\xe2\x80\x94according as the Picture Dealers found the market, when they\r\nchristened it. It is the figure of a woman, supremely handsome, who,\r\nturning away, but with her face addressed to the spectator, flashes her\r\nproud glance upon him.\r\n\r\nIt is like Edith.\r\n\r\nWith a passing gesture of his hand at the picture\xe2\x80\x94what! a menace? No;\r\nyet something like it. A wave as of triumph? No; yet more like that. An\r\ninsolent salute wafted from his lips? No; yet like that too\xe2\x80\x94he resumes\r\nhis breakfast, and calls to the chafing and imprisoned bird, who coming\r\ndown into a pendant gilded hoop within the cage, like a great\r\nwedding-ring, swings in it, for his delight.\r\n\r\nThe second home is on the other side of London, near to where the busy\r\ngreat north road of bygone days is silent and almost deserted, except\r\nby wayfarers who toil along on foot. It is a poor small house, barely\r\nand sparely furnished, but very clean; and there is even an attempt to\r\ndecorate it, shown in the homely flowers trained about the porch and in\r\nthe narrow garden. The neighbourhood in which it stands has as little\r\nof the country to recommend it, as it has of the town. It is neither of\r\nthe town nor country. The former, like the giant in his travelling\r\nboots, has made a stride and passed it, and has set his\r\nbrick-and-mortar heel a long way in advance; but the intermediate space\r\nbetween the giant\xe2\x80\x99s feet, as yet, is only blighted country, and not\r\ntown; and, here, among a few tall chimneys belching smoke all day and\r\nnight, and among the brick-fields and the lanes where turf is cut, and\r\nwhere the fences tumble down, and where the dusty nettles grow, and\r\nwhere a scrap or two of hedge may yet be seen, and where the\r\nbird-catcher still comes occasionally, though he swears every time to\r\ncome no more\xe2\x80\x94this second home is to be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe who inhabits it, is she who left the first in her devotion to an\r\noutcast brother. She withdrew from that home its redeeming spirit, and\r\nfrom its master\xe2\x80\x99s breast his solitary angel: but though his liking for\r\nher is gone, after this ungrateful slight as he considers it; and\r\nthough he abandons her altogether in return, an old idea of her is not\r\nquite forgotten even by him. Let her flower-garden, in which he never\r\nsets his foot, but which is yet maintained, among all his costly\r\nalterations, as if she had quitted it but yesterday, bear witness!\r\n\r\nHarriet Carker has changed since then, and on her beauty there has\r\nfallen a heavier shade than Time of his unassisted self can cast,\r\nall-potent as he is\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of anxiety and sorrow, and the daily\r\nstruggle of a poor existence. But it is beauty still; and still a\r\ngentle, quiet, and retiring beauty that must be sought out, for it\r\ncannot vaunt itself; if it could, it would be what it is, no more.\r\n\r\nYes. This slight, small, patient figure, neatly dressed in homely\r\nstuffs, and indicating nothing but the dull, household virtues, that\r\nhave so little in common with the received idea of heroism and\r\ngreatness, unless, indeed, any ray of them should shine through the\r\nlives of the great ones of the earth, when it becomes a constellation\r\nand is tracked in Heaven straightway\xe2\x80\x94this slight, small, patient\r\nfigure, leaning on the man still young but worn and grey, is she, his\r\nsister, who, of all the world, went over to him in his shame and put\r\nher hand in his, and with a sweet composure and determination, led him\r\nhopefully upon his barren way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is early, John,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go so early?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot many minutes earlier than usual, Harriet. If I have the time to\r\nspare, I should like, I think\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a fancy\xe2\x80\x94to walk once by the house\r\nwhere I took leave of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had ever seen or known him, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better as it is, my dear, remembering his fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I could not regret it more, though I had known him. Is not your\r\nsorrow mine? And if I had, perhaps you would feel that I was a better\r\ncompanion to you in speaking about him, than I may seem now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest sister! Is there anything within the range of rejoicing or\r\nregret, in which I am not sure of your companionship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you think not, John, for surely there is nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you be better to me, or nearer to me then, than you are in\r\nthis, or anything?\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that you did know him,\r\nHarriet, and that you shared my feelings towards him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew the hand which had been resting on his shoulder, round his\r\nneck, and answered, with some hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou think I might have done him no harm if I\r\nhad allowed myself to know him better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink! I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesignedly, Heaven knows I would not,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, shaking his head\r\nmournfully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut his reputation was too precious to be perilled by such\r\nassociation. Whether you share that knowledge, or do not, my dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is still the truth, Harriet, and my mind is lighter when I think of\r\nhim for that which made it so much heavier then.\xe2\x80\x9d He checked himself in\r\nhis tone of melancholy, and smiled upon her as he said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear John! In the evening, at the old time and place, I\r\nshall meet you as usual on your way home. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cordial face she lifted up to his to kiss him, was his home, his\r\nlife, his universe, and yet it was a portion of his punishment and\r\ngrief; for in the cloud he saw upon it\xe2\x80\x94though serene and calm as any\r\nradiant cloud at sunset\xe2\x80\x94and in the constancy and devotion of her life,\r\nand in the sacrifice she had made of ease, enjoyment, and hope, he saw\r\nthe bitter fruits of his old crime, for ever ripe and fresh.\r\n\r\nShe stood at the door looking after him, with her hands loosely clasped\r\nin each other, as he made his way over the frowzy and uneven patch of\r\nground which lay before their house, which had once (and not long ago)\r\nbeen a pleasant meadow, and was now a very waste, with a disorderly\r\ncrop of beginnings of mean houses, rising out of the rubbish, as if\r\nthey had been unskilfully sown there. Whenever he looked back\xe2\x80\x94as once\r\nor twice he did\xe2\x80\x94her cordial face shone like a light upon his heart; but\r\nwhen he plodded on his way, and saw her not, the tears were in her eyes\r\nas she stood watching him.\r\n\r\nHer pensive form was not long idle at the door. There was daily duty to\r\ndischarge, and daily work to do\xe2\x80\x94for such commonplace spirits that are\r\nnot heroic, often work hard with their hands\xe2\x80\x94and Harriet was soon busy\r\nwith her household tasks. These discharged, and the poor house made\r\nquite neat and orderly, she counted her little stock of money, with an\r\nanxious face, and went out thoughtfully to buy some necessaries for\r\ntheir table, planning and conniving, as she went, how to save. So\r\nsordid are the lives of such low natures, who are not only not heroic\r\nto their valets and waiting-women, but have neither valets nor\r\nwaiting-women to be heroic to withal!\r\n\r\nWhile she was absent, and there was no one in the house, there\r\napproached it by a different way from that the brother had taken, a\r\ngentleman, a very little past his prime of life perhaps, but of a\r\nhealthy florid hue, an upright presence, and a bright clear aspect,\r\nthat was gracious and good-humoured. His eyebrows were still black, and\r\nso was much of his hair; the sprinkling of grey observable among the\r\nlatter, graced the former very much, and showed his broad frank brow\r\nand honest eyes to great advantage.\r\n\r\nAfter knocking once at the door, and obtaining no response, this\r\ngentleman sat down on a bench in the little porch to wait. A certain\r\nskilful action of his fingers as he hummed some bars, and beat time on\r\nthe seat beside him, seemed to denote the musician; and the\r\nextraordinary satisfaction he derived from humming something very slow\r\nand long, which had no recognisable tune, seemed to denote that he was\r\na scientific one.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was still twirling a theme, which seemed to go round and\r\nround and round, and in and in and in, and to involve itself like a\r\ncorkscrew twirled upon a table, without getting any nearer to anything,\r\nwhen Harriet appeared returning. He rose up as she advanced, and stood\r\nwith his head uncovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are come again, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faltering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take that liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask for five minutes of your\r\nleisure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, she opened the door, and gave him\r\nadmission to the little parlour. The gentleman sat down there, drew his\r\nchair to the table over against her, and said, in a voice that\r\nperfectly corresponded to his appearance, and with a simplicity that\r\nwas very engaging:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Harriet, you cannot be proud. You signified to me, when I called\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other morning, that you were. Pardon me if I say that I looked into\r\nyour face while you spoke, and that it contradicted you. I look into it\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laying his hand gently on her arm, for an instant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand it contradicts you more and more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat confused and agitated, and could make no ready answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mirror of truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said her visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cand gentleness. Excuse\r\nmy trusting to it, and returning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner of saying these words, divested them entirely of the\r\ncharacter of compliments. It was so plain, grave, unaffected, and\r\nsincere, that she bent her head, as if at once to thank him, and\r\nacknowledge his sincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disparity between our ages,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nplainness of my purpose, empower me, I am glad to think, to speak my\r\nmind. That is my mind; and so you see me for the second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a kind of pride, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilence, \xe2\x80\x9cor what may be supposed to be pride, which is mere duty. I\r\nhope I cherish no other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94pardon me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cFor your brother John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud of his love, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, looking full upon her visitor,\r\nand changing her manner on the instant\xe2\x80\x94not that it was less composed\r\nand quiet, but that there was a deep impassioned earnestness in it that\r\nmade the very tremble in her voice a part of her firmness, \xe2\x80\x9cand proud\r\nof him. Sir, you who strangely know the story of his life, and repeated\r\nit to me when you were here last\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely to make my way into your confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the gentleman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou revived it, in my hearing, with a kind and\r\ngood purpose. I am quite sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her visitor, pressing her hand hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nmuch obliged to you. You do me justice, I assure you. You were going to\r\nsay, that I, who know the story of John Carker\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay think it pride in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I say that I am proud\r\nof him! I am. You know the time was, when I was not\xe2\x80\x94when I could not\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94but that is past. The humility of many years, the uncomplaining\r\nexpiation, the true repentance, the terrible regret, the pain I know he\r\nhas even in my affection, which he thinks has cost me dear, though\r\nHeaven knows I am happy, but for his sorrow I\xe2\x80\x94oh, Sir, after what I\r\nhave seen, let me conjure you, if you are in any place of power, and\r\nare ever wronged, never, for any wrong, inflict a punishment that\r\ncannot be recalled; while there is a GOD above us to work changes in\r\nthe hearts He made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother is an altered man,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gentleman,\r\ncompassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was an altered man when he did wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an\r\naltered man again, and is his true self now, believe me, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said her visitor, rubbing his forehead, in an absent\r\nmanner, with his hand, and then drumming thoughtfully on the table, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ngo on in our clockwork routine, from day to day, and can\xe2\x80\x99t make out, or\r\nfollow, these changes. They\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re a metaphysical sort of thing. We\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t leisure for it. We\xe2\x80\x94we haven\xe2\x80\x99t courage. They\xe2\x80\x99re not taught at\r\nschools or colleges, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to set about it. In short,\r\nwe are so d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d business-like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, walking to the\r\nwindow, and back, and sitting down again, in a state of extreme\r\ndissatisfaction and vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, rubbing his forehead again; and\r\ndrumming on the table as before, \xe2\x80\x9cI have good reason to believe that a\r\njog-trot life, the same from day to day, would reconcile one to\r\nanything. One don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything, one don\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything, one don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything; that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact. We go on taking everything for granted,\r\nand so we go on, until whatever we do, good, bad, or indifferent, we do\r\nfrom habit. Habit is all I shall have to report, when I am called upon\r\nto plead to my conscience, on my death-bed. \xe2\x80\x98Habit,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98I was\r\ndeaf, dumb, blind, and paralytic, to a million things, from habit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very business-like indeed, Mr What\xe2\x80\x99s-your-name,\xe2\x80\x99 says Conscience, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t do here!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman got up and walked to the window again and back: seriously\r\nuneasy, though giving his uneasiness this peculiar expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, resuming his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would let me\r\nserve you. Look at me; I ought to look honest, for I know I am so, at\r\npresent. Do I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe every word you have said,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI am full of\r\nself-reproach that I might have known this and seen this, and known you\r\nand seen you, any time these dozen years, and that I never have. I\r\nhardly know how I ever got here\xe2\x80\x94creature that I am, not only of my own\r\nhabit, but of other people\xe2\x80\x99s! But having done so, let me do something.\r\nI ask it in all honour and respect. You inspire me with both, in the\r\nhighest degree. Let me do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are contented, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not quite,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI think not quite. There\r\nare some little comforts that might smooth your life, and his. And\r\nhis!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, fancying that had made some impression on her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been in the habit of thinking that there was nothing wanting to be\r\ndone for him; that it was all settled and over; in short, of not\r\nthinking at all about it. I am different now. Let me do something for\r\nhim. You too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, with careful delicacy, \xe2\x80\x9chave need to\r\nwatch your health closely, for his sake, and I fear it fails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever you may be, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harriet, raising her eyes to his\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cI am deeply grateful to you. I feel certain that in all you say,\r\nyou have no object in the world but kindness to us. But years have\r\npassed since we began this life; and to take from my brother any part\r\nof what has so endeared him to me, and so proved his better\r\nresolution\xe2\x80\x94any fragment of the merit of his unassisted, obscure, and\r\nforgotten reparation\xe2\x80\x94would be to diminish the comfort it will be to him\r\nand me, when that time comes to each of us, of which you spoke just\r\nnow. I thank you better with these tears than any words. Believe it,\r\npray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was moved, and put the hand she held out, to his lips,\r\nmuch as a tender father might kiss the hand of a dutiful child. But\r\nmore reverently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the day should ever come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he is restored, in\r\npart, to the position he lost\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRestored!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can that be hoped for?\r\nIn whose hands does the power of any restoration lie? It is no mistake\r\nof mine, surely, to suppose that his having gained the priceless\r\nblessing of his life, is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us; not even\r\nbetween us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your forgiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have known it. I\r\nentreat you to forget that I have done so, inadvertently. And now, as I\r\ndare urge no more\xe2\x80\x94as I am not sure that I have a right to do so\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nHeaven knows, even that doubt may be habit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman,\r\nrubbing his head, as despondently as before, \xe2\x80\x9clet me; though a\r\nstranger, yet no stranger; ask two favours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first, that if you should see cause to change your resolution, you\r\nwill suffer me to be as your right hand. My name shall then be at your\r\nservice; it is useless now, and always insignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur choice of friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, smiling faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cis not so\r\ngreat, that I need any time for consideration. I can promise that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second, that you will allow me sometimes, say every Monday\r\nmorning, at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94habit again\xe2\x80\x94I must be businesslike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngentleman, with a whimsical inclination to quarrel with himself on that\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x9cin walking past, to see you at the door or window. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nto come in, as your brother will be gone out at that hour. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nto speak to you. I merely ask to see, for the satisfaction of my own\r\nmind, that you are well, and without intrusion to remind you, by the\r\nsight of me, that you have a friend\xe2\x80\x94an elderly friend, grey-haired\r\nalready, and fast growing greyer\xe2\x80\x94whom you may ever command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cordial face looked up in his; confided in it; and promised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, as before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\npurpose not to mention my visit to John Carker, lest he should be at\r\nall distressed by my acquaintance with his history. I am glad of it,\r\nfor it is out of the ordinary course of things, and\xe2\x80\x94habit again!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe gentleman, checking himself impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cas if there were no\r\nbetter course than the ordinary course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he turned to go, and walking, bareheaded, to the outside of\r\nthe little porch, took leave of her with such a happy mixture of\r\nunconstrained respect and unaffected interest, as no breeding could\r\nhave taught, no truth mistrusted, and nothing but a pure and single\r\nheart expressed.\r\n\r\nMany half-forgotten emotions were awakened in the sister\xe2\x80\x99s mind by this\r\nvisit. It was so very long since any other visitor had crossed their\r\nthreshold; it was so very long since any voice of apathy had made sad\r\nmusic in her ears; that the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s figure remained present to her,\r\nhours afterwards, when she sat at the window, plying her needle; and\r\nhis words seemed newly spoken, again and again. He had touched the\r\nspring that opened her whole life; and if she lost him for a short\r\nspace, it was only among the many shapes of the one great recollection\r\nof which that life was made.\r\n\r\nMusing and working by turns; now constraining herself to be steady at\r\nher needle for a long time together, and now letting her work fall,\r\nunregarded, on her lap, and straying wheresoever her busier thoughts\r\nled, Harriet Carker found the hours glide by her, and the day steal on.\r\nThe morning, which had been bright and clear, gradually became\r\novercast; a sharp wind set in; the rain fell heavily; and a dark mist\r\ndrooping over the distant town, hid it from the view.\r\n\r\nShe often looked with compassion, at such a time, upon the stragglers\r\nwho came wandering into London, by the great highway hard by, and who,\r\nfootsore and weary, and gazing fearfully at the huge town before them,\r\nas if foreboding that their misery there would be but as a drop of\r\nwater in the sea, or as a grain of sea-sand on the shore, went\r\nshrinking on, cowering before the angry weather, and looking as if the\r\nvery elements rejected them. Day after day, such travellers crept past,\r\nbut always, as she thought, in one direction\xe2\x80\x94always towards the town.\r\nSwallowed up in one phase or other of its immensity, towards which they\r\nseemed impelled by a desperate fascination, they never returned. Food\r\nfor the hospitals, the churchyards, the prisons, the river, fever,\r\nmadness, vice, and death,\xe2\x80\x94they passed on to the monster, roaring in the\r\ndistance, and were lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe chill wind was howling, and the rain was falling, and the day was\r\ndarkening moodily, when Harriet, raising her eyes from the work on\r\nwhich she had long since been engaged with unremitting constancy, saw\r\none of these travellers approaching.\r\n\r\nA woman. A solitary woman of some thirty years of age; tall;\r\nwell-formed; handsome; miserably dressed; the soil of many country\r\nroads in varied weather\xe2\x80\x94dust, chalk, clay, gravel\xe2\x80\x94clotted on her grey\r\ncloak by the streaming wet; no bonnet on her head, nothing to defend\r\nher rich black hair from the rain, but a torn handkerchief; with the\r\nfluttering ends of which, and with her hair, the wind blinded her so\r\nthat she often stopped to push them back, and look upon the way she was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nShe was in the act of doing so, when Harriet observed her. As her\r\nhands, parting on her sunburnt forehead, swept across her face, and\r\nthrew aside the hindrances that encroached upon it, there was a\r\nreckless and regardless beauty in it: a dauntless and depraved\r\nindifference to more than weather: a carelessness of what was cast upon\r\nher bare head from Heaven or earth: that, coupled with her misery and\r\nloneliness, touched the heart of her fellow-woman. She thought of all\r\nthat was perverted and debased within her, no less than without: of\r\nmodest graces of the mind, hardened and steeled, like these attractions\r\nof the person; of the many gifts of the Creator flung to the winds like\r\nthe wild hair; of all the beautiful ruin upon which the storm was\r\nbeating and the night was coming.\r\n\r\nThinking of this, she did not turn away with a delicate indignation\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nmany of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do\xe2\x80\x94but pitied\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer fallen sister came on, looking far before her, trying with her\r\neager eyes to pierce the mist in which the city was enshrouded, and\r\nglancing, now and then, from side to side, with the bewildered\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nuncertain aspect of a stranger. Though her tread was bold and\r\ncourageous, she was fatigued, and after a moment of irresolution,\xe2\x80\x94sat\r\ndown upon a heap of stones; seeking no shelter from the rain, but\r\nletting it rain on her as it would.\r\n\r\nShe was now opposite the house; raising her head after resting it for a\r\nmoment on both hands, her eyes met those of Harriet.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, Harriet was at the door; and the other, rising from her\r\nseat at her beck, came slowly, and with no conciliatory look, towards\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you rest in the rain?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have no other resting-place,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are many places of shelter near here. This,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to\r\nthe little porch, \xe2\x80\x9cis better than where you were. You are very welcome\r\nto rest here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wanderer looked at her, in doubt and surprise, but without any\r\nexpression of thankfulness; and sitting down, and taking off one of her\r\nworn shoes to beat out the fragments of stone and dust that were\r\ninside, showed that her foot was cut and bleeding.\r\n\r\nHarriet uttering an expression of pity, the traveller looked up with a\r\ncontemptuous and incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s a torn foot to such as me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s a torn\r\nfoot in such as me, to such as you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in and wash it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harriet, mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me give you\r\nsomething to bind it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman caught her arm, and drawing it before her own eyes, hid them\r\nagainst it, and wept. Not like a woman, but like a stern man surprised\r\ninto that weakness; with a violent heaving of her breast, and struggle\r\nfor recovery, that showed how unusual the emotion was with her.\r\n\r\nShe submitted to be led into the house, and, evidently more in\r\ngratitude than in any care for herself, washed and bound the injured\r\nplace. Harriet then put before her fragments of her own frugal dinner,\r\nand when she had eaten of them, though sparingly, besought her, before\r\nresuming her road (which she showed her anxiety to do), to dry her\r\nclothes before the fire. Again, more in gratitude than with any\r\nevidence of concern in her own behalf, she sat down in front of it, and\r\nunbinding the handkerchief about her head, and letting her thick wet\r\nhair fall down below her waist, sat drying it with the palms of her\r\nhands, and looking at the blaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you are thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting her head suddenly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I used to be handsome, once. I believe I was\xe2\x80\x94I know I was\xe2\x80\x94Look\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her hair roughly with both hands; seizing it as if she\r\nwould have torn it out; then, threw it down again, and flung it back as\r\nthough it were a heap of serpents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a stranger in this place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, stopping between each short reply, and\r\nlooking at the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Ten or a dozen years a stranger. I have had\r\nno almanack where I have been. Ten or a dozen years. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know this\r\npart. It\xe2\x80\x99s much altered since I went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery far. Months upon months over the sea, and far away even then. I\r\nhave been where convicts go,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking full upon her\r\nentertainer. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been one myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven help you and forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d was the gentle answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Heaven help me and forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, nodding her head at\r\nthe fire. \xe2\x80\x9cIf man would help some of us a little more, God would\r\nforgive us all the sooner perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was softened by the earnest manner, and the cordial face so\r\nfull of mildness and so free from judgment, of her, and said, less\r\nhardily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may be about the same age, you and me. If I am older, it is not\r\nabove a year or two. Oh think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her arms, as though the exhibition of her outward form would\r\nshow the moral wretch she was; and letting them drop at her sides, hung\r\ndown her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing we may not hope to repair; it is never too late to\r\namend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are penitent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not! I can\xe2\x80\x99t be. I am no such thing. Why\r\nshould I be penitent, and all the world go free? They talk to me of my\r\npenitence. Who\xe2\x80\x99s penitent for the wrongs that have been done to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose up, bound her handkerchief about her head, and turned to move\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, pointing with her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTo London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any home to go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have a mother. She\xe2\x80\x99s as much a mother, as her dwelling is a\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with a bitter laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, putting money in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to do well.\r\nIt is very little, but for one day it may keep you from harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you married?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, faintly, as she took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I live here with my brother. We have not much to spare, or I would\r\ngive you more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me kiss you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing no scorn or repugnance in her face, the object of her charity\r\nbent over her as she asked the question, and pressed her lips against\r\nher cheek. Once more she caught her arm, and covered her eyes with it;\r\nand then was gone.\r\n\r\nGone into the deepening night, and howling wind, and pelting rain;\r\nurging her way on towards the mist-enshrouded city where the blurred\r\nlights gleamed; and with her black hair, and disordered head-gear,\r\nfluttering round her reckless face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nAnother Mother and Daughter\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an ugly and dark room, an old woman, ugly and dark too, sat\r\nlistening to the wind and rain, and crouching over a meagre fire. More\r\nconstant to the last-named occupation than the first, she never changed\r\nher attitude, unless, when any stray drops of rain fell hissing on the\r\nsmouldering embers, to raise her head with an awakened attention to the\r\nwhistling and pattering outside, and gradually to let it fall again\r\nlower and lower and lower as she sunk into a brooding state of thought,\r\nin which the noises of the night were as indistinctly regarded as is\r\nthe monotonous rolling of a sea by one who sits in contemplation on its\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThere was no light in the room save that which the fire afforded.\r\nGlaring sullenly from time to time like the eye of a fierce beast half\r\nasleep, it revealed no objects that needed to be jealous of a better\r\ndisplay. A heap of rags, a heap of bones, a wretched bed, two or three\r\nmutilated chairs or stools, the black walls and blacker ceiling, were\r\nall its winking brightness shone upon. As the old woman, with a\r\ngigantic and distorted image of herself thrown half upon the wall\r\nbehind her, half upon the roof above, sat bending over the few loose\r\nbricks within which it was pent, on the damp hearth of the chimney\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthere was no stove\xe2\x80\x94she looked as if she were watching at some witch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naltar for a favourable token; and but that the movement of her\r\nchattering jaws and trembling chin was too frequent and too fast for\r\nthe slow flickering of the fire, it would have seemed an illusion\r\nwrought by the light, as it came and went, upon a face as motionless as\r\nthe form to which it belonged.\r\n\r\nIf Florence could have stood within the room and looked upon the\r\noriginal of the shadow thrown upon the wall and roof as it cowered thus\r\nover the fire, a glance might have sufficed to recall the figure of\r\nGood Mrs Brown; notwithstanding that her childish recollection of that\r\nterrible old woman was as grotesque and exaggerated a presentment of\r\nthe truth, perhaps, as the shadow on the wall. But Florence was not\r\nthere to look on; and Good Mrs Brown remained unrecognised, and sat\r\nstaring at her fire, unobserved.\r\n\r\nAttracted by a louder sputtering than usual, as the rain came hissing\r\ndown the chimney in a little stream, the old woman raised her head,\r\nimpatiently, to listen afresh. And this time she did not drop it again;\r\nfor there was a hand upon the door, and a footstep in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne who brings you news, was the answer, in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews? Where from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom beyond seas?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, from beyond seas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman raked the fire together, hurriedly, and going close to\r\nher visitor who had entered, and shut the door, and who now stood in\r\nthe middle of the room, put her hand upon the drenched cloak, and\r\nturned the unresisting figure, so as to have it in the full light of\r\nthe fire. She did not find what she had expected, whatever that might\r\nbe; for she let the cloak go again, and uttered a querulous cry of\r\ndisappointment and misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! Oho!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, turning her face upward, with a\r\nterrible howl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the visitor again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my gal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, tossing up her arms, and\r\nclasping her hands above her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my Alice? Where\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nhandsome daughter? They\xe2\x80\x99ve been the death of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve not been the death of her yet, if your name\xe2\x80\x99s Marwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen my gal, then?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cHas she wrote to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more I can!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old woman, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no light here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, looking round the room.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, mumbling and shaking her head, and muttering to herself\r\nabout her handsome daughter, brought a candle from a cupboard in the\r\ncorner, and thrusting it into the fire with a trembling hand, lighted\r\nit with some difficulty and set it on the table. Its dirty wick burnt\r\ndimly at first, being choked in its own grease; and when the bleared\r\neyes and failing sight of the old woman could distinguish anything by\r\nits light, her visitor was sitting with her arms folded, her eyes\r\nturned downwards, and a handkerchief she had worn upon her head lying\r\non the table by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sent to me by word of mouth then, my gal, Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled the old\r\nwoman, after waiting for some moments. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the visitor.\r\n\r\nThe old woman repeated the word in a scared uncertain way; and, shading\r\nher eyes, looked at the speaker, round the room, and at the speaker\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice said look again, mother;\xe2\x80\x9d and the speaker fixed her eyes upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAgain the old woman looked round the room, and at her visitor, and\r\nround the room once more. Hastily seizing the candle, and rising from\r\nher seat, she held it to the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s face, uttered a loud cry, set\r\ndown the light, and fell upon her neck!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my gal! It\xe2\x80\x99s my Alice! It\xe2\x80\x99s my handsome daughter, living and come\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the old woman, rocking herself to and fro upon the\r\nbreast that coldly suffered her embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my gal! It\xe2\x80\x99s my Alice!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my handsome daughter, living and come back!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed again,\r\ndropping on the floor before her, clasping her knees, laying her head\r\nagainst them, and still rocking herself to and fro with every frantic\r\ndemonstration of which her vitality was capable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Alice, stooping forward for a moment and\r\nkissing her, but endeavouring, even in the act, to disengage herself\r\nfrom her embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cI am here, at last. Let go, mother; let go. Get up,\r\nand sit in your chair. What good does this do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s come back harder than she went!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mother, looking up in\r\nher face, and still holding to her knees. \xe2\x80\x9cShe don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me! after\r\nall these years, and all the wretched life I\xe2\x80\x99ve led!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, shaking her ragged skirts to detach the old\r\nwoman from them: \xe2\x80\x9cthere are two sides to that. There have been years\r\nfor me as well as you, and there has been wretchedness for me as well\r\nas you. Get up, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother rose, and cried, and wrung her hands, and stood at a little\r\ndistance gazing on her. Then she took the candle again, and going round\r\nher, surveyed her from head to foot, making a low moaning all the time.\r\nThen she put the candle down, resumed her chair, and beating her hands\r\ntogether to a kind of weary tune, and rolling herself from side to\r\nside, continued moaning and wailing to herself.\r\n\r\nAlice got up, took off her wet cloak, and laid it aside. That done, she\r\nsat down as before, and with her arms folded, and her eyes gazing at\r\nthe fire, remained silently listening with a contemptuous face to her\r\nold mother\xe2\x80\x99s inarticulate complainings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you expect to see me return as youthful as I went away, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said at length, turning her eyes upon the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you think\r\na foreign life, like mine, was good for good looks? One would believe\r\nso, to hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mother. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it then?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had best be something\r\nthat don\xe2\x80\x99t last, mother, or my way out is easier than my way in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all these years she threatens\r\nto desert me in the moment of her coming back again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, mother, for the second time, there have been years for me\r\nas well as you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome back harder? Of course I have come\r\nback harder. What else did you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarder to me! To her own dear mother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who began to harden me, if my own dear mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe returned, sitting with her folded arms, and knitted brows, and\r\ncompressed lips as if she were bent on excluding, by force, every\r\nsofter feeling from her breast. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, mother, to a word or two. If\r\nwe understand each other now, we shall not fall out any more, perhaps.\r\nI went away a girl, and have come back a woman. I went away undutiful\r\nenough, and have come back no better, you may swear. But have you been\r\nvery dutiful to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cTo my gal! A mother dutiful to her own\r\nchild!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds unnatural, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter, looking coldly\r\non her with her stern, regardless, hardy, beautiful face; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have\r\nthought of it sometimes, in the course of my lone years, till I have\r\ngot used to it. I have heard some talk about duty first and last; but\r\nit has always been of my duty to other people. I have wondered now and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94to pass away the time\xe2\x80\x94whether no one ever owed any duty to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother sat mowing, and mumbling, and shaking her head, but whether\r\nangrily or remorsefully, or in denial, or only in her physical\r\ninfirmity, did not appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a child called Alice Marwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter, with a\r\nlaugh, and looking down at herself in terrible derision of herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cborn, among poverty and neglect, and nursed in it. Nobody taught her,\r\nnobody stepped forward to help her, nobody cared for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the mother, pointing to herself, and striking her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only care she knew,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to be beaten, and\r\nstinted, and abused sometimes; and she might have done better without\r\nthat. She lived in homes like this, and in the streets, with a crowd of\r\nlittle wretches like herself; and yet she brought good looks out of\r\nthis childhood. So much the worse for her. She had better have been\r\nhunted and worried to death for ugliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on! go on!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going on,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a girl called Alice\r\nMarwood. She was handsome. She was taught too late, and taught all\r\nwrong. She was too well cared for, too well trained, too well helped\r\non, too much looked after. You were very fond of her\xe2\x80\x94you were better\r\noff then. What came to that girl comes to thousands every year. It was\r\nonly ruin, and she was born to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all these years!\xe2\x80\x9d whined the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cMy gal begins with\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have ended,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a criminal\r\ncalled Alice Marwood\xe2\x80\x94a girl still, but deserted and an outcast. And she\r\nwas tried, and she was sentenced. And lord, how the gentlemen in the\r\nCourt talked about it! and how grave the judge was on her duty, and on\r\nher having perverted the gifts of nature\xe2\x80\x94as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know better\r\nthan anybody there, that they had been made curses to her!\xe2\x80\x94and how he\r\npreached about the strong arm of the Law\xe2\x80\x94so very strong to save her,\r\nwhen she was an innocent and helpless little wretch!\xe2\x80\x94and how solemn and\r\nreligious it all was! I have thought of that, many times since, to be\r\nsure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe folded her arms tightly on her breast, and laughed in a tone that\r\nmade the howl of the old woman musical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Alice Marwood was transported, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cand was sent\r\nto learn her duty, where there was twenty times less duty, and more\r\nwickedness, and wrong, and infamy, than here. And Alice Marwood is come\r\nback a woman. Such a woman as she ought to be, after all this. In good\r\ntime, there will be more solemnity, and more fine talk, and more strong\r\narm, most likely, and there will be an end of her; but the gentlemen\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of being thrown out of work. There\xe2\x80\x99s crowds of little\r\nwretches, boy and girl, growing up in any of the streets they live in,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll keep them to it till they\xe2\x80\x99ve made their fortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman leaned her elbows on the table, and resting her face upon\r\nher two hands, made a show of being in great distress\xe2\x80\x94or really was,\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! I have done, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter, with a motion of her\r\nhead, as if in dismissal of the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said enough. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nyou and I talk of being dutiful, whatever we do. Your childhood was\r\nlike mine, I suppose. So much the worse for both of us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nblame you, or to defend myself; why should I? That\xe2\x80\x99s all over long ago.\r\nBut I am a woman\xe2\x80\x94not a girl, now\xe2\x80\x94and you and I needn\xe2\x80\x99t make a show of\r\nour history, like the gentlemen in the Court. We know all about it,\r\nwell enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLost and degraded as she was, there was a beauty in her, both of face\r\nand form, which, even in its worst expression, could not but be\r\nrecognised as such by anyone regarding her with the least attention. As\r\nshe subsided into silence, and her face which had been harshly\r\nagitated, quieted down; while her dark eyes, fixed upon the fire,\r\nexchanged the reckless light that had animated them, for one that was\r\nsoftened by something like sorrow; there shone through all her wayworn\r\nmisery and fatigue, a ray of the departed radiance of the fallen angel.\r\n\r\nHer mother, after watching her for some time without speaking, ventured\r\nto steal her withered hand a little nearer to her across the table; and\r\nfinding that she permitted this, to touch her face, and smooth her\r\nhair. With the feeling, as it seemed, that the old woman was at least\r\nsincere in this show of interest, Alice made no movement to check her;\r\nso, advancing by degrees, she bound up her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hair afresh, took\r\noff her wet shoes, if they deserved the name, spread something dry upon\r\nher shoulders, and hovered humbly about her, muttering to herself, as\r\nshe recognised her old features and expression more and more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very poor, mother, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, looking round, when she\r\nhad sat thus for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitter poor, my deary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman.\r\n\r\nShe admired her daughter, and was afraid of her. Perhaps her\r\nadmiration, such as it was, had originated long ago, when she first\r\nfound anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid\r\nfight of her existence. Perhaps her fear was referable, in some sort,\r\nto the retrospect she had so lately heard. Be this as it might, she\r\nstood, submissively and deferentially, before her child, and inclined\r\nher head, as if in a pitiful entreaty to be spared any further\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have you lived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy begging, my deary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pilfering, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, Ally\xe2\x80\x94in a very small way. I am old and timid. I have taken\r\ntrifles from children now and then, my deary, but not often. I have\r\ntramped about the country, pet, and I know what I know. I have\r\nwatched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatched?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have hung about a family, my deary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, even more\r\nhumbly and submissively than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, darling. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. I did it for the love of you.\r\nIn memory of my poor gal beyond seas.\xe2\x80\x9d She put out her hand\r\ndeprecatingly, and drawing it back again, laid it on her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYears ago, my deary,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, glancing timidly at the attentive\r\nand stern face opposed to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI came across his little child, by\r\nchance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot his, Alice deary; don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that; not his. How could\r\nit be his? You know he has none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose then?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Ally; you frighten me, deary. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94only Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nSince then, darling, I have seen them often. I have seen _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn uttering this last word, the old woman shrunk and recoiled, as if\r\nwith sudden fear that her daughter would strike her. But though the\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s face was fixed upon her, and expressed the most vehement\r\npassion, she remained still: except that she clenched her arms tighter\r\nand tighter within each other, on her bosom, as if to restrain them by\r\nthat means from doing an injury to herself, or someone else, in the\r\nblind fury of the wrath that suddenly possessed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle he thought who I was!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, shaking her clenched\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd little he cared!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered her daughter, between her teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there we were, said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cface to face. I spoke to him,\r\nand he spoke to me. I sat and watched him as he went away down a long\r\ngrove of trees: and at every step he took, I cursed him soul and body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will thrive in spite of that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the daughter disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he is thriving,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\nShe held her peace; for the face and form before her were unshaped by\r\nrage. It seemed as if the bosom would burst with the emotions that\r\nstrove within it. The effort that constrained and held it pent up, was\r\nno less formidable than the rage itself: no less bespeaking the violent\r\nand dangerous character of the woman who made it. But it succeeded, and\r\nshe asked, after a silence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, deary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I know of, deary. But his master and friend is married. Oh,\r\nwe may give him joy! We may give \xe2\x80\x99em all joy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman,\r\nhugging herself with her lean arms in her exultation. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but joy\r\nto us will come of that marriage. Mind me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe daughter looked at her for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are wet and tired; hungry and thirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman,\r\nhobbling to the cupboard; \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s little here, and little\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94diving\r\ndown into her pocket, and jingling a few half\xe2\x80\x94pence on the\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clittle here. Have you any money, Alice, deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe covetous, sharp, eager face, with which she asked the question and\r\nlooked on, as her daughter took out of her bosom the little gift she\r\nhad so lately received, told almost as much of the history of this\r\nparent and child as the child herself had told in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more. I should not have this, but for charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for charity, eh, deary?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, bending greedily over\r\nthe table to look at the money, which she appeared distrustful of her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s still retaining in her hand, and gazing on. \xe2\x80\x9cHumph! six and\r\nsix is twelve, and six eighteen\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94we must make the most of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nbuy something to eat and drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith greater alacrity than might have been expected in one of her\r\nappearance\xe2\x80\x94for age and misery seemed to have made her as decrepit as\r\nugly\xe2\x80\x94she began to occupy her trembling hands in tying an old bonnet on\r\nher head, and folding a torn shawl about herself: still eyeing the\r\nmoney in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with the same sharp desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat joy is to come to us of this marriage, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\ndaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not told me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe joy,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, attiring herself, with fumbling fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cof no\r\nlove at all, and much pride and hate, my deary. The joy of confusion\r\nand strife among \xe2\x80\x99em, proud as they are, and of danger\xe2\x80\x94danger, Alice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen what I have seen. I know what I know!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the\r\nmother. \xe2\x80\x9cLet some look to it. Let some be upon their guard. My gal may\r\nkeep good company yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that in the wondering earnestness with which her daughter\r\nregarded her, her hand involuntarily closed upon the money, the old\r\nwoman made more speed to secure it, and hurriedly added, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nbuy something; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go buy something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she stood with her hand stretched out before her daughter, her\r\ndaughter, glancing again at the money, put it to her lips before\r\nparting with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Ally! Do you kiss it?\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s like me\xe2\x80\x94I\r\noften do. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so good to us!\xe2\x80\x9d squeezing her own tarnished\r\nhalfpence up to her bag of a throat, \xe2\x80\x9cso good to us in everything but\r\nnot coming in heaps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kiss it, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cor I did then\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat I ever did before\xe2\x80\x94for the giver\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe giver, eh, deary?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the old woman, whose dimmed eyes\r\nglistened as she took it. \xe2\x80\x9cAy! I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss it for the giver\xe2\x80\x99s sake, too,\r\nwhen the giver can make it go farther. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go spend it, deary.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to say you know a great deal, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter,\r\nfollowing her to the door with her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have grown very wise\r\nsince we parted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the old woman, coming back a step or two, \xe2\x80\x9cI know more\r\nthan you think I know more than he thinks, deary, as I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you by\r\nand bye. I know all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe daughter smiled incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of his brother, Alice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, stretching out her\r\nneck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful, \xe2\x80\x9cwho might have been\r\nwhere you have been\xe2\x80\x94for stealing money\xe2\x80\x94and who lives with his sister,\r\nover yonder, by the north road out of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the north road out of London, deary. You shall see the house if you\r\nlike. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t much to boast of, genteel as his own is. No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the old woman, shaking her head and laughing; for her daughter\r\nhad started up, \xe2\x80\x9cnot now; it\xe2\x80\x99s too far off; it\xe2\x80\x99s by the milestone,\r\nwhere the stones are heaped;\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow, deary, if it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, and you\r\nare in the humour. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go spend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d and the daughter flung herself upon her, with her former\r\npassion raging like a fire. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sister is a fair-faced Devil, with\r\nbrown hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, amazed and terrified, nodded her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see the shadow of him in her face! It\xe2\x80\x99s a red house standing by\r\nitself. Before the door there is a small green porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the old woman nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn which I sat today! Give me back the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice! Deary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me back the money, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe forced it from the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand as she spoke, and utterly\r\nindifferent to her complainings and entreaties, threw on the garments\r\nshe had taken off, and hurried out, with headlong speed.\r\n\r\nThe mother followed, limping after her as she could, and expostulating\r\nwith no more effect upon her than upon the wind and rain and darkness\r\nthat encompassed them. Obdurate and fierce in her own purpose, and\r\nindifferent to all besides, the daughter defied the weather and the\r\ndistance, as if she had known no travel or fatigue, and made for the\r\nhouse where she had been relieved. After some quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalking, the old woman, spent and out of breath, ventured to hold by\r\nher skirts; but she ventured no more, and they travelled on in silence\r\nthrough the wet and gloom. If the mother now and then uttered a word of\r\ncomplaint, she stifled it lest her daughter should break away from her\r\nand leave her behind; and the daughter was dumb.\r\n\r\nIt was within an hour or so of midnight, when they left the regular\r\nstreets behind them, and entered on the deeper gloom of that neutral\r\nground where the house was situated. The town lay in the distance,\r\nlurid and lowering; the bleak wind howled over the open space; all\r\naround was black, wild, desolate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fit place for me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter, stopping to look back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so, when I was here before, today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice, my deary,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mother, pulling her gently by the skirt.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give the money back, my darling; please don\xe2\x80\x99t. We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford\r\nit. We want supper, deary. Money is money, whoever gives it. Say what\r\nyou will, but keep the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there!\xe2\x80\x9d was all the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the house I mean.\r\nIs that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman nodded in the affirmative; and a few more paces brought\r\nthem to the threshold. There was the light of fire and candle in the\r\nroom where Alice had sat to dry her clothes; and on her knocking at the\r\ndoor, John Carker appeared from that room.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to see such visitors at such an hour, and asked Alice\r\nwhat she wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman who gave me money today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her raised voice, Harriet came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are here! Do you remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, wondering.\r\n\r\nThe face that had humbled itself before her, looked on her now with\r\nsuch invincible hatred and defiance; and the hand that had gently\r\ntouched her arm, was clenched with such a show of evil purpose, as if\r\nit would gladly strangle her; that she drew close to her brother for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I could speak with you, and not know you! That I could come near\r\nyou, and not feel what blood was running in your veins, by the tingling\r\nof my own!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, with a menacing gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? What have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have sat me by your fire; you have\r\ngiven me food and money; you have bestowed your compassion on me! You!\r\nwhose name I spit upon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, with a malevolence that made her ugliness quite awful,\r\nshook her withered hand at the brother and sister in confirmation of\r\nher daughter, but plucked her by the skirts again, nevertheless,\r\nimploring her to keep the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I dropped a tear upon your hand, may it wither it up! If I spoke a\r\ngentle word in your hearing, may it deafen you! If I touched you with\r\nmy lips, may the touch be poison to you! A curse upon this roof that\r\ngave me shelter! Sorrow and shame upon your head! Ruin upon all\r\nbelonging to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said the words, she threw the money down upon the ground, and\r\nspurned it with her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tread it in the dust: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it if it paved my way to\r\nHeaven! I would the bleeding foot that brought me here today, had\r\nrotted off, before it led me to your house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet, pale and trembling, restrained her brother, and suffered her\r\nto go on uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well that I should be pitied and forgiven by you, or anyone of\r\nyour name, in the first hour of my return! It was well that you should\r\nact the kind good lady to me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you when I die; I\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for\r\nyou, and all your race, you may be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a fierce action of her hand, as if she sprinkled hatred on the\r\nground, and with it devoted those who were standing there to\r\ndestruction, she looked up once at the black sky, and strode out into\r\nthe wild night.\r\n\r\nThe mother, who had plucked at her skirts again and again in vain, and\r\nhad eyed the money lying on the threshold with an absorbing greed that\r\nseemed to concentrate her faculties upon it, would have prowled about,\r\nuntil the house was dark, and then groped in the mire on the chance of\r\nrepossessing herself of it. But the daughter drew her away, and they\r\nset forth, straight, on their return to their dwelling; the old woman\r\nwhimpering and bemoaning their loss upon the road, and fretfully\r\nbewailing, as openly as she dared, the undutiful conduct of her\r\nhandsome girl in depriving her of a supper, on the very first night of\r\ntheir reunion.\r\n\r\nSupperless to bed she went, saving for a few coarse fragments; and\r\nthose she sat mumbling and munching over a scrap of fire, long after\r\nher undutiful daughter lay asleep.\r\n\r\nWere this miserable mother, and this miserable daughter, only the\r\nreduction to their lowest grade, of certain social vices sometimes\r\nprevailing higher up? In this round world of many circles within\r\ncircles, do we make a weary journey from the high grade to the low, to\r\nfind at last that they lie close together, that the two extremes touch,\r\nand that our journey\xe2\x80\x99s end is but our starting-place? Allowing for\r\ngreat difference of stuff and texture, was the pattern of this woof\r\nrepeated among gentle blood at all?\r\n\r\nSay, Edith Dombey! And Cleopatra, best of mothers, let us have your\r\ntestimony!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nThe Happy Pair\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark blot on the street is gone. Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s mansion, if it be a\r\ngap among the other houses any longer, is only so because it is not to\r\nbe vied with in its brightness, and haughtily casts them off. The\r\nsaying is, that home is home, be it never so homely. If it hold good in\r\nthe opposite contingency, and home is home be it never so stately, what\r\nan altar to the Household Gods is raised up here!\r\n\r\nLights are sparkling in the windows this evening, and the ruddy glow of\r\nfires is warm and bright upon the hangings and soft carpets, and the\r\ndinner waits to be served, and the dinner-table is handsomely set\r\nforth, though only for four persons, and the side board is cumbrous\r\nwith plate. It is the first time that the house has been arranged for\r\noccupation since its late changes, and the happy pair are looked for\r\nevery minute.\r\n\r\nOnly second to the wedding morning, in the interest and expectation it\r\nengenders among the household, is this evening of the coming home. Mrs\r\nPerch is in the kitchen taking tea; and has made the tour of the\r\nestablishment, and priced the silks and damasks by the yard, and\r\nexhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive\r\nof admiration and wonder. The upholsterer\xe2\x80\x99s foreman, who has left his\r\nhat, with a pocket-handkerchief in it, both smelling strongly of\r\nvarnish, under a chair in the hall, lurks about the house, gazing\r\nupwards at the cornices, and downward at the carpets, and occasionally,\r\nin a silent transport of enjoyment, taking a rule out of his pocket,\r\nand skirmishingly measuring expensive objects, with unutterable\r\nfeelings. Cook is in high spirits, and says give her a place where\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of company (as she\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you sixpence there will be\r\nnow), for she is of a lively disposition, and she always was from a\r\nchild, and she don\xe2\x80\x99t mind who knows it; which sentiment elicits from\r\nthe breast of Mrs Perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation.\r\nAll the housemaid hopes is, happiness for \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94but marriage is a\r\nlottery, and the more she thinks about it, the more she feels the\r\nindependence and the safety of a single life. Mr Towlinson is saturnine\r\nand grim, and says that\xe2\x80\x99s his opinion too, and give him War besides,\r\nand down with the French\xe2\x80\x94for this young man has a general impression\r\nthat every foreigner is a Frenchman, and must be by the laws of nature.\r\n\r\nAt each new sound of wheels, they all stop, whatever they are saying,\r\nand listen; and more than once there is a general starting up and a cry\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cHere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d But here they are not yet; and Cook begins to mourn\r\nover the dinner, which has been put back twice, and the upholsterer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforeman still goes lurking about the rooms, undisturbed in his blissful\r\nreverie!\r\n\r\nFlorence is ready to receive her father and her new Mama. Whether the\r\nemotions that are throbbing in her breast originate in pleasure or in\r\npain, she hardly knows. But the fluttering heart sends added colour to\r\nher cheeks, and brightness to her eyes; and they say downstairs,\r\ndrawing their heads together\xe2\x80\x94for they always speak softly when they\r\nspeak of her\xe2\x80\x94how beautiful Miss Florence looks tonight, and what a\r\nsweet young lady she has grown, poor dear! A pause succeeds; and then\r\nCook, feeling, as president, that her sentiments are waited for,\r\nwonders whether\xe2\x80\x94and there stops. The housemaid wonders too, and so does\r\nMrs Perch, who has the happy social faculty of always wondering when\r\nother people wonder, without being at all particular what she wonders\r\nat. Mr Towlinson, who now descries an opportunity of bringing down the\r\nspirits of the ladies to his own level, says wait and see; he wishes\r\nsome people were well out of this. Cook leads a sigh then, and a murmur\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a strange world, it is indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d and when it has gone round\r\nthe table, adds persuasively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Miss Florence can\xe2\x80\x99t well be the\r\nworse for any change, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Towlinson\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder, pregnant with\r\nfrightful meaning, is \xe2\x80\x9cOh, can\xe2\x80\x99t she though!\xe2\x80\x9d and sensible that a mere\r\nman can scarcely be more prophetic, or improve upon that, he holds his\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton, prepared to greet her darling daughter and dear son-in-law\r\nwith open arms, is appropriately attired for that purpose in a very\r\nyouthful costume, with short sleeves. At present, however, her ripe\r\ncharms are blooming in the shade of her own apartments, whence she had\r\nnot emerged since she took possession of them a few hours ago, and\r\nwhere she is fast growing fretful, on account of the postponement of\r\ndinner. The maid who ought to be a skeleton, but is in truth a buxom\r\ndamsel, is, on the other hand, in a most amiable state: considering her\r\nquarterly stipend much safer than heretofore, and foreseeing a great\r\nimprovement in her board and lodging.\r\n\r\nWhere are the happy pair, for whom this brave home is waiting? Do\r\nsteam, tide, wind, and horses, all abate their speed, to linger on such\r\nhappiness? Does the swarm of loves and graces hovering about them\r\nretard their progress by its numbers? Are there so many flowers in\r\ntheir happy path, that they can scarcely move along, without\r\nentanglement in thornless roses, and sweetest briar?\r\n\r\nThey are here at last! The noise of wheels is heard, grows louder, and\r\na carriage drives up to the door! A thundering knock from the obnoxious\r\nforeigner anticipates the rush of Mr Towlinson and party to open it;\r\nand Mr Dombey and his bride alight, and walk in arm in arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweetest Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d cries an agitated voice upon the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndearest Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d and the short sleeves wreath themselves about the\r\nhappy couple in turn, and embrace them.\r\n\r\nFlorence had come down to the hall too, but did not advance: reserving\r\nher timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should\r\nsubside. But the eyes of Edith sought her out, upon the threshold; and\r\ndismissing her sensitive parent with a slight kiss on the cheek, she\r\nhurried on to Florence and embraced her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\nAs Florence, trembling, raised it to her lips, she met his glance. The\r\nlook was cold and distant enough, but it stirred her heart to think\r\nthat she observed in it something more of interest than he had ever\r\nshown before. It even expressed a kind of faint surprise, and not a\r\ndisagreeable surprise, at sight of her. She dared not raise her eyes to\r\nhis any more; but she felt that he looked at her once again, and not\r\nless favourably. Oh what a thrill of joy shot through her, awakened by\r\neven this intangible and baseless confirmation of her hope that she\r\nwould learn to win him, through her new and beautiful Mama!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be long dressing, Mrs Dombey, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be ready immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them send up dinner in a quarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Mr Dombey stalked away to his own dressing-room, and Mrs\r\nDombey went upstairs to hers. Mrs Skewton and Florence repaired to the\r\ndrawing-room, where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on\r\nher to shed a few irrepressible tears, supposed to be forced from her\r\nby her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s felicity; and which she was still drying, very\r\ngingerly, with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief, when her\r\nson-in-law appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how, my dearest Dombey, did you find that delightfullest of\r\ncities, Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, subduing her emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was cold,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGay as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cof course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot particularly. I thought it dull,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, my dearest Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d archly; \xe2\x80\x9cdull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt made that impression upon me, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with grave\r\npoliteness. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe Mrs Dombey found it dull too. She mentioned once\r\nor twice that she thought it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you naughty girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Skewton, rallying her dear child,\r\nwho now entered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat dreadfully heretical things have you been saying\r\nabout Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith raised her eyebrows with an air of weariness; and passing the\r\nfolding-doors which were thrown open to display the suite of rooms in\r\ntheir new and handsome garniture, and barely glancing at them as she\r\npassed, sat down by Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9chow charmingly these people have\r\ncarried out every idea that we hinted. They have made a perfect palace\r\nof the house, positively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cI directed that no\r\nexpense should be spared; and all that money could do, has been done, I\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what can it not do, dear Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is powerful, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nHe looked in his solemn way towards his wife, but not a word said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing her after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, with\r\nespecial distinctness; \xe2\x80\x9cthat these alterations meet with your\r\napproval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are as handsome as they can be,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, with haughty\r\ncarelessness. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should be so, of course. And I suppose they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn expression of scorn was habitual to the proud face, and seemed\r\ninseparable from it; but the contempt with which it received any appeal\r\nto admiration, respect, or consideration on the ground of his riches,\r\nno matter how slight or ordinary in itself, was a new and different\r\nexpression, unequalled in intensity by any other of which it was\r\ncapable. Whether Mr Dombey, wrapped in his own greatness, was at all\r\naware of this, or no, there had not been wanting opportunities already\r\nfor his complete enlightenment; and at that moment it might have been\r\neffected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him, after\r\nit had rapidly and scornfully surveyed the theme of his\r\nself-glorification. He might have read in that one glance that nothing\r\nthat his wealth could do, though it were increased ten thousand fold,\r\ncould win him for its own sake, one look of softened recognition from\r\nthe defiant woman, linked to him, but arrayed with her whole soul\r\nagainst him. He might have read in that one glance that even for its\r\nsordid and mercenary influence upon herself, she spurned it, while she\r\nclaimed its utmost power as her right, her bargain\xe2\x80\x94as the base and\r\nworthless recompense for which she had become his wife. He might have\r\nread in it that, ever baring her own head for the lightning of her own\r\ncontempt and pride to strike, the most innocent allusion to the power\r\nof his riches degraded her anew, sunk her deeper in her own respect,\r\nand made the blight and waste within her more complete.\r\n\r\nBut dinner was announced, and Mr Dombey led down Cleopatra; Edith and\r\nhis daughter following. Sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration\r\non the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt, and deigning to bestow\r\nno look upon the elegancies around her, she took her place at his board\r\nfor the first time, and sat, like a statue, at the feast.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, being a good deal in the statue way himself, was well enough\r\npleased to see his handsome wife immovable and proud and cold. Her\r\ndeportment being always elegant and graceful, this as a general\r\nbehaviour was agreeable and congenial to him. Presiding, therefore,\r\nwith his accustomed dignity, and not at all reflecting on his wife by\r\nany warmth or hilarity of his own, he performed his share of the\r\nhonours of the table with a cool satisfaction; and the installation\r\ndinner, though not regarded downstairs as a great success, or very\r\npromising beginning, passed off, above, in a sufficiently polite,\r\ngenteel, and frosty manner.\r\n\r\nSoon after tea, Mrs Skewton, who affected to be quite overcome and worn\r\nout by her emotions of happiness, arising in the contemplation of her\r\ndear child united to the man of her heart, but who, there is reason to\r\nsuppose, found this family party somewhat dull, as she yawned for one\r\nhour continually behind her fan, retired to bed. Edith, also, silently\r\nwithdrew and came back no more. Thus, it happened that Florence, who\r\nhad been upstairs to have some conversation with Diogenes, returning to\r\nthe drawing-room with her little work-basket, found no one there but\r\nher father, who was walking to and fro, in dreary magnificence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. Shall I go away, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence faintly,\r\nhesitating at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, looking round over his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\r\ncome and go here, Florence, as you please. This is not my private\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence entered, and sat down at a distant little table with her work:\r\nfinding herself for the first time in her life\xe2\x80\x94for the very first time\r\nwithin her memory from her infancy to that hour\xe2\x80\x94alone with her father,\r\nas his companion. She, his natural companion, his only child, who in\r\nher lonely life and grief had known the suffering of a breaking heart;\r\nwho, in her rejected love, had never breathed his name to God at night,\r\nbut with a tearful blessing, heavier on him than a curse; who had\r\nprayed to die young, so she might only die in his arms; who had, all\r\nthrough, repaid the agony of slight and coldness, and dislike, with\r\npatient unexacting love, excusing him, and pleading for him, like his\r\nbetter angel!\r\n\r\nShe trembled, and her eyes were dim. His figure seemed to grow in\r\nheight and bulk before her as he paced the room: now it was all blurred\r\nand indistinct; now clear again, and plain; and now she seemed to think\r\nthat this had happened, just the same, a multitude of years ago. She\r\nyearned towards him, and yet shrunk from his approach. Unnatural\r\nemotion in a child, innocent of wrong! Unnatural the hand that had\r\ndirected the sharp plough, which furrowed up her gentle nature for the\r\nsowing of its seeds!\r\n\r\nBent upon not distressing or offending him by her distress, Florence\r\ncontrolled herself, and sat quietly at her work. After a few more turns\r\nacross and across the room, he left off pacing it; and withdrawing into\r\na shadowy corner at some distance, where there was an easy chair,\r\ncovered his head with a handkerchief, and composed himself to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was enough for Florence to sit there watching him; turning her eyes\r\ntowards his chair from time to time; watching him with her thoughts,\r\nwhen her face was intent upon her work; and sorrowfully glad to think\r\nthat he _could_ sleep, while she was there, and that he was not made\r\nrestless by her strange and long-forbidden presence.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been her thoughts if she had known that he was steadily\r\nregarding her; that the veil upon his face, by accident or by design,\r\nwas so adjusted that his sight was free, and that it never wandered\r\nfrom her face an instant. That when she looked towards him, in the\r\nobscure dark corner, her speaking eyes, more earnest and pathetic in\r\ntheir voiceless speech than all the orators of all the world, and\r\nimpeaching him more nearly in their mute address, met his, and did not\r\nknow it! That when she bent her head again over her work, he drew his\r\nbreath more easily, but with the same attention looked upon her\r\nstill\xe2\x80\x94upon her white brow and her falling hair, and busy hands; and\r\nonce attracted, seemed to have no power to turn his eyes away!\r\n\r\nAnd what were his thoughts meanwhile? With what emotions did he prolong\r\nthe attentive gaze covertly directed on his unknown daughter? Was there\r\nreproach to him in the quiet figure and the mild eyes? Had he begun to\r\nfeel her disregarded claims and did they touch him home at last, and\r\nwaken him to some sense of his cruel injustice?\r\n\r\nThere are yielding moments in the lives of the sternest and harshest\r\nmen, though such men often keep their secret well. The sight of her in\r\nher beauty, almost changed into a woman without his knowledge, may have\r\nstruck out some such moments even in his life of pride. Some passing\r\nthought that he had had a happy home within his reach\xe2\x80\x94had had a\r\nhousehold spirit bending at his feet\xe2\x80\x94had overlooked it in his\r\nstiffnecked sullen arrogance, and wandered away and lost himself, may\r\nhave engendered them. Some simple eloquence distinctly heard, though\r\nonly uttered in her eyes, unconscious that he read them as \xe2\x80\x9cBy the\r\ndeath-beds I have tended, by the childhood I have suffered, by our\r\nmeeting in this dreary house at midnight, by the cry wrung from me in\r\nthe anguish of my heart, oh, father, turn to me and seek a refuge in my\r\nlove before it is too late!\xe2\x80\x9d may have arrested them. Meaner and lower\r\nthoughts, as that his dead boy was now superseded by new ties, and he\r\ncould forgive the having been supplanted in his affection, may have\r\noccasioned them. The mere association of her as an ornament, with all\r\nthe ornament and pomp about him, may have been sufficient. But as he\r\nlooked, he softened to her, more and more. As he looked, she became\r\nblended with the child he had loved, and he could hardly separate the\r\ntwo. As he looked, he saw her for an instant by a clearer and a\r\nbrighter light, not bending over that child\xe2\x80\x99s pillow as his\r\nrival\xe2\x80\x94monstrous thought\xe2\x80\x94but as the spirit of his home, and in the\r\naction tending himself no less, as he sat once more with his bowed-down\r\nhead upon his hand at the foot of the little bed. He felt inclined to\r\nspeak to her, and call her to him. The words \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere rising to his lips\xe2\x80\x94but slowly and with difficulty, they were so\r\nvery strange\xe2\x80\x94when they were checked and stifled by a footstep on the\r\nstair.\r\n\r\nIt was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s. She had exchanged her dinner dress for a loose robe,\r\nand unbound her hair, which fell freely about her neck. But this was\r\nnot the change in her that startled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been looking for you everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she sat down by the side of Florence, she stooped and kissed her\r\nhand. He hardly knew his wife. She was so changed. It was not merely\r\nthat her smile was new to him\xe2\x80\x94though that he had never seen; but her\r\nmanner, the tone of her voice, the light of her eyes, the interest, and\r\nconfidence, and winning wish to please, expressed in all-this was not\r\nEdith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, dear Mama. Papa is asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Edith now. She looked towards the corner where he was, and he\r\nknew that face and manner very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely thought you could be here, Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, how altered and how softened, in an instant!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left here early,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cpurposely to sit upstairs and talk\r\nwith you. But, going to your room, I found my bird was flown, and I\r\nhave been waiting there ever since, expecting its return.\r\n\r\nIf it had been a bird, indeed, she could not have taken it more\r\ntenderly and gently to her breast, than she did Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa will not expect to find me, I suppose, when he wakes,\xe2\x80\x9d hesitated\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will, Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, looking full upon her.\r\n\r\nFlorence drooped her head, and rose, and put up her work-basket. Edith\r\ndrew her hand through her arm, and they went out of the room like\r\nsisters. Her very step was different and new to him, Mr Dombey thought,\r\nas his eyes followed her to the door.\r\n\r\nHe sat in his shadowy corner so long, that the church clocks struck the\r\nhour three times before he moved that night. All that while his face\r\nwas still intent upon the spot where Florence had been seated. The room\r\ngrew darker, as the candles waned and went out; but a darkness gathered\r\non his face, exceeding any that the night could cast, and rested there.\r\n\r\nFlorence and Edith, seated before the fire in the remote room where\r\nlittle Paul had died, talked together for a long time. Diogenes, who\r\nwas of the party, had at first objected to the admission of Edith, and,\r\neven in deference to his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s wish, had only permitted it under\r\ngrowling protest. But, emerging by little and little from the\r\nante-room, whither he had retired in dudgeon, he soon appeared to\r\ncomprehend, that with the most amiable intentions he had made one of\r\nthose mistakes which will occasionally arise in the best-regulated\r\ndogs\xe2\x80\x99 minds; as a friendly apology for which he stuck himself up on end\r\nbetween the two, in a very hot place in front of the fire, and sat\r\npanting at it, with his tongue out, and a most imbecile expression of\r\ncountenance, listening to the conversation.\r\n\r\nIt turned, at first, on Florence\xe2\x80\x99s books and favourite pursuits, and on\r\nthe manner in which she had beguiled the interval since the marriage.\r\nThe last theme opened up to her a subject which lay very near her\r\nheart, and she said, with the tears starting to her eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mama! I have had a great sorrow since that day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou a great sorrow, Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Poor Walter is drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence spread her hands before her face, and wept with all her heart.\r\nMany as were the secret tears which Walter\xe2\x80\x99s fate had cost her, they\r\nflowed yet, when she thought or spoke of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, soothing her. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was Walter? What\r\nwas he to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was my brother, Mama. After dear Paul died, we said we would be\r\nbrother and sister. I had known him a long time\xe2\x80\x94from a little child. He\r\nknew Paul, who liked him very much; Paul said, almost at the last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care of Walter, dear Papa! I was fond of him!\xe2\x80\x99 Walter had been\r\nbrought in to see him, and was there then\xe2\x80\x94in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he take care of Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Edith, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa? He appointed him to go abroad. He was drowned in shipwreck on\r\nhis voyage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he know that he is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell, Mama. I have no means of knowing. Dear Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nFlorence, clinging to her as for help, and hiding her face upon her\r\nbosom, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that you have seen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay! Stop, Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d Edith turned so pale, and spoke so earnestly,\r\nthat Florence did not need her restraining hand upon her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\nall about Walter first; let me understand this history all through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence related it, and everything belonging to it, even down to the\r\nfriendship of Mr Toots, of whom she could hardly speak in her distress\r\nwithout a tearful smile, although she was deeply grateful to him. When\r\nshe had concluded her account, to the whole of which Edith, holding her\r\nhand, listened with close attention, and when a silence had succeeded,\r\nEdith said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you know I have seen, Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, with the same mute appeal, and the same\r\nquick concealment of her face as before, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am not a favourite\r\nchild, Mama. I never have been. I have never known how to be. I have\r\nmissed the way, and had no one to show it to me. Oh, let me learn from\r\nyou how to become dearer to Papa Teach me! you, who can so well!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nclinging closer to her, with some broken fervent words of gratitude and\r\nendearment, Florence, relieved of her sad secret, wept long, but not as\r\npainfully as of yore, within the encircling arms of her new mother.\r\n\r\nPale even to her lips, and with a face that strove for composure until\r\nits proud beauty was as fixed as death, Edith looked down upon the\r\nweeping girl, and once kissed her. Then gradually disengaging herself,\r\nand putting Florence away, she said, stately, and quiet as a marble\r\nimage, and in a voice that deepened as she spoke, but had no other\r\ntoken of emotion in it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, you do not know me! Heaven forbid that you should learn from\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot learn from you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Florence, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I should teach you how to love, or be loved, Heaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEdith. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could teach me, that were better; but it is too late.\r\nYou are dear to me, Florence. I did not think that anything could ever\r\nbe so dear to me, as you are in this little time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw that Florence would have spoken here, so checked her with her\r\nhand, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be your true friend always. I will cherish you, as much, if not\r\nas well as anyone in this world could. You may trust in me\xe2\x80\x94I know it\r\nand I say it, dear,\xe2\x80\x94with the whole confidence even of your pure heart.\r\nThere are hosts of women whom he might have married, better and truer\r\nin all other respects than I am, Florence; but there is not one who\r\ncould come here, his wife, whose heart could beat with greater truth to\r\nyou than mine does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, dear Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom that first most happy day\r\nI have known it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost happy day!\xe2\x80\x9d Edith seemed to repeat the words involuntarily, and\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cThough the merit is not mine, for I thought little of you\r\nuntil I saw you, let the undeserved reward be mine in your trust and\r\nlove. And in this\xe2\x80\x94in this, Florence; on the first night of my taking up\r\nmy abode here; I am led on as it is best I should be, to say it for the\r\nfirst and last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence, without knowing why, felt almost afraid to hear her proceed,\r\nbut kept her eyes riveted on the beautiful face so fixed upon her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever seek to find in me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, laying her hand upon her\r\nbreast, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is not here. Never if you can help it, Florence, fall off\r\nfrom me because it is not here. Little by little you will know me\r\nbetter, and the time will come when you will know me, as I know myself.\r\nThen, be as lenient to me as you can, and do not turn to bitterness the\r\nonly sweet remembrance I shall have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears that were visible in her eyes as she kept them fixed on\r\nFlorence, showed that the composed face was but as a handsome mask; but\r\nshe preserved it, and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen what you say, and know how true it is. But believe me\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwill soon, if you cannot now\xe2\x80\x94there is no one on this earth less\r\nqualified to set it right or help you, Florence, than I. Never ask me\r\nwhy, or speak to me about it or of my husband, more. There should be,\r\nso far, a division, and a silence between us two, like the grave\r\nitself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat for some time silent; Florence scarcely venturing to breathe\r\nmeanwhile, as dim and imperfect shadows of the truth, and all its daily\r\nconsequences, chased each other through her terrified, yet incredulous\r\nimagination. Almost as soon as she had ceased to speak, Edith\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nbegan to subside from its set composure to that quieter and more\r\nrelenting aspect, which it usually wore when she and Florence were\r\nalone together. She shaded it, after this change, with her hands; and\r\nwhen she arose, and with an affectionate embrace bade Florence\r\ngood-night, went quickly, and without looking round.\r\n\r\nBut when Florence was in bed, and the room was dark except for the glow\r\nof the fire, Edith returned, and saying that she could not sleep, and\r\nthat her dressing-room was lonely, drew a chair upon the hearth, and\r\nwatched the embers as they died away. Florence watched them too from\r\nher bed, until they, and the noble figure before them, crowned with its\r\nflowing hair, and in its thoughtful eyes reflecting back their light,\r\nbecame confused and indistinct, and finally were lost in slumber.\r\n\r\nIn her sleep, however, Florence could not lose an undefined impression\r\nof what had so recently passed. It formed the subject of her dreams,\r\nand haunted her; now in one shape, now in another; but always\r\noppressively; and with a sense of fear. She dreamed of seeking her\r\nfather in wildernesses, of following his track up fearful heights, and\r\ndown into deep mines and caverns; of being charged with something that\r\nwould release him from extraordinary suffering\xe2\x80\x94she knew not what, or\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94yet never being able to attain the goal and set him free. Then she\r\nsaw him dead, upon that very bed, and in that very room, and knew that\r\nhe had never loved her to the last, and fell upon his cold breast,\r\npassionately weeping. Then a prospect opened, and a river flowed, and a\r\nplaintive voice she knew, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is running on, Floy! It has never\r\nstopped! You are moving with it!\xe2\x80\x9d And she saw him at a distance\r\nstretching out his arms towards her, while a figure such as Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nused to be, stood near him, awfully serene and still. In every vision,\r\nEdith came and went, sometimes to her joy, sometimes to her sorrow,\r\nuntil they were alone upon the brink of a dark grave, and Edith\r\npointing down, she looked and saw\xe2\x80\x94what!\xe2\x80\x94another Edith lying at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nIn the terror of this dream, she cried out and awoke, she thought. A\r\nsoft voice seemed to whisper in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, dear Florence, it\r\nis nothing but a dream!\xe2\x80\x9d and stretching out her arms, she returned the\r\ncaress of her new Mama, who then went out at the door in the light of\r\nthe grey morning. In a moment, Florence sat up wondering whether this\r\nhad really taken place or not; but she was only certain that it was\r\ngrey morning indeed, and that the blackened ashes of the fire were on\r\nthe hearth, and that she was alone.\r\n\r\nSo passed the night on which the happy pair came home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nHousewarming\r\n\r\n\r\nMany succeeding days passed in like manner; except that there were\r\nnumerous visits received and paid, and that Mrs Skewton held little\r\nlevees in her own apartments, at which Major Bagstock was a frequent\r\nattendant, and that Florence encountered no second look from her\r\nfather, although she saw him every day. Nor had she much communication\r\nin words with her new Mama, who was imperious and proud to all the\r\nhouse but her\xe2\x80\x94Florence could not but observe that\xe2\x80\x94and who, although she\r\nalways sent for her or went to her when she came home from visiting,\r\nand would always go into her room at night, before retiring to rest,\r\nhowever late the hour, and never lost an opportunity of being with her,\r\nwas often her silent and thoughtful companion for a long time together.\r\n\r\nFlorence, who had hoped for so much from this marriage, could not help\r\nsometimes comparing the bright house with the faded dreary place out of\r\nwhich it had arisen, and wondering when, in any shape, it would begin\r\nto be a home; for that it was no home then, for anyone, though\r\neverything went on luxuriously and regularly, she had always a secret\r\nmisgiving. Many an hour of sorrowful reflection by day and night, and\r\nmany a tear of blighted hope, Florence bestowed upon the assurance her\r\nnew Mama had given her so strongly, that there was no one on the earth\r\nmore powerless than herself to teach her how to win her father\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\nAnd soon Florence began to think\xe2\x80\x94resolved to think would be the truer\r\nphrase\xe2\x80\x94that as no one knew so well, how hopeless of being subdued or\r\nchanged her father\xe2\x80\x99s coldness to her was, so she had given her this\r\nwarning, and forbidden the subject in very compassion. Unselfish here,\r\nas in her every act and fancy, Florence preferred to bear the pain of\r\nthis new wound, rather than encourage any faint foreshadowings of the\r\ntruth as it concerned her father; tender of him, even in her wandering\r\nthoughts. As for his home, she hoped it would become a better one, when\r\nits state of novelty and transition should be over; and for herself,\r\nthought little and lamented less.\r\n\r\nIf none of the new family were particularly at home in private, it was\r\nresolved that Mrs Dombey at least should be at home in public, without\r\ndelay. A series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials,\r\nand in cultivation of society, were arranged, chiefly by Mr Dombey and\r\nMrs Skewton; and it was settled that the festive proceedings should\r\ncommence by Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s being at home upon a certain evening, and by\r\nMr and Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s requesting the honour of the company of a great\r\nmany incongruous people to dinner on the same day.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mr Dombey produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who\r\nwere to be bidden to this feast on his behalf; to which Mrs Skewton,\r\nacting for her dearest child, who was haughtily careless on the\r\nsubject, subjoined a western list, comprising Cousin Feenix, not yet\r\nreturned to Baden-Baden, greatly to the detriment of his personal\r\nestate; and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages, who had, at\r\nvarious times, fluttered round the light of her fair daughter, or\r\nherself, without any lasting injury to their wings. Florence was\r\nenrolled as a member of the dinner-party, by Edith\xe2\x80\x99s command\xe2\x80\x94elicited\r\nby a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt and hesitation on the part of Mrs Skewton; and\r\nFlorence, with a wondering heart, and with a quick instinctive sense of\r\neverything that grated on her father in the least, took her silent\r\nshare in the proceedings of the day.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings commenced by Mr Dombey, in a cravat of extraordinary\r\nheight and stiffness, walking restlessly about the drawing-room until\r\nthe hour appointed for dinner; punctual to which, an East India\r\nDirector, of immense wealth, in a waistcoat apparently constructed in\r\nserviceable deal by some plain carpenter, but really engendered in the\r\ntailor\xe2\x80\x99s art, and composed of the material called nankeen, arrived and\r\nwas received by Mr Dombey alone. The next stage of the proceedings was\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s sending his compliments to Mrs Dombey, with a correct\r\nstatement of the time; and the next, the East India Director\xe2\x80\x99s falling\r\nprostrate, in a conversational point of view, and as Mr Dombey was not\r\nthe man to pick him up, staring at the fire until rescue appeared in\r\nthe shape of Mrs Skewton; whom the director, as a pleasant start in\r\nlife for the evening, mistook for Mrs Dombey, and greeted with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe next arrival was a Bank Director, reputed to be able to buy up\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94human Nature generally, if he should take it in his head to\r\ninfluence the money market in that direction\xe2\x80\x94but who was a wonderfully\r\nmodest-spoken man, almost boastfully so, and mentioned his \xe2\x80\x9clittle\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x9d at Kingston-upon-Thames, and its just being barely equal to\r\ngiving Dombey a bed and a chop, if he would come and visit it. Ladies,\r\nhe said, it was not for a man who lived in his quiet way to take upon\r\nhimself to invite\xe2\x80\x94but if Mrs Skewton and her daughter, Mrs Dombey,\r\nshould ever find themselves in that direction, and would do him the\r\nhonour to look at a little bit of a shrubbery they would find there,\r\nand a poor little flower-bed or so, and a humble apology for a pinery,\r\nand two or three little attempts of that sort without any pretension,\r\nthey would distinguish him very much. Carrying out his character, this\r\ngentleman was very plainly dressed, in a wisp of cambric for a\r\nneckcloth, big shoes, a coat that was too loose for him, and a pair of\r\ntrousers that were too spare; and mention being made of the Opera by\r\nMrs Skewton, he said he very seldom went there, for he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford\r\nit. It seemed greatly to delight and exhilarate him to say so: and he\r\nbeamed on his audience afterwards, with his hands in his pockets, and\r\nexcessive satisfaction twinkling in his eyes.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs Dombey appeared, beautiful and proud, and as disdainful and\r\ndefiant of them all as if the bridal wreath upon her head had been a\r\ngarland of steel spikes put on to force concession from her which she\r\nwould die sooner than yield. With her was Florence. When they entered\r\ntogether, the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s face. But unobserved; for Florence did not venture to raise\r\nher eyes to his, and Edith\xe2\x80\x99s indifference was too supreme to take the\r\nleast heed of him.\r\n\r\nThe arrivals quickly became numerous. More directors, chairmen of\r\npublic companies, elderly ladies carrying burdens on their heads for\r\nfull dress, Cousin Feenix, Major Bagstock, friends of Mrs Skewton, with\r\nthe same bright bloom on their complexion, and very precious necklaces\r\non very withered necks. Among these, a young lady of sixty-five,\r\nremarkably coolly dressed as to her back and shoulders, who spoke with\r\nan engaging lisp, and whose eyelids wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up well, without a\r\ngreat deal of trouble on her part, and whose manners had that\r\nindefinable charm which so frequently attaches to the giddiness of\r\nyouth. As the greater part of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list were disposed to be\r\ntaciturn, and the greater part of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list were disposed to be\r\ntalkative, and there was no sympathy between them, Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list,\r\nby magnetic agreement, entered into a bond of union against Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlist, who, wandering about the rooms in a desolate manner, or seeking\r\nrefuge in corners, entangled themselves with company coming in, and\r\nbecame barricaded behind sofas, and had doors opened smartly from\r\nwithout against their heads, and underwent every sort of discomfiture.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was announced, Mr Dombey took down an old lady like a\r\ncrimson velvet pincushion stuffed with bank notes, who might have been\r\nthe identical old lady of Threadneedle Street, she was so rich, and\r\nlooked so unaccommodating; Cousin Feenix took down Mrs Dombey; Major\r\nBagstock took down Mrs Skewton; the young thing with the shoulders was\r\nbestowed, as an extinguisher, upon the East India Director; and the\r\nremaining ladies were left on view in the drawing-room by the remaining\r\ngentlemen, until a forlorn hope volunteered to conduct them downstairs,\r\nand those brave spirits with their captives blocked up the dining-room\r\ndoor, shutting out seven mild men in the stony-hearted hall. When all\r\nthe rest were got in and were seated, one of these mild men still\r\nappeared, in smiling confusion, totally destitute and unprovided for,\r\nand, escorted by the butler, made the complete circuit of the table\r\ntwice before his chair could be found, which it finally was, on Mrs\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s left hand; after which the mild man never held up his head\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow, the spacious dining-room, with the company seated round the\r\nglittering table, busy with their glittering spoons, and knives and\r\nforks, and plates, might have been taken for a grown-up exposition of\r\nTom Tiddler\xe2\x80\x99s ground, where children pick up gold and silver. Mr\r\nDombey, as Tiddler, looked his character to admiration; and the long\r\nplateau of precious metal frosted, separating him from Mrs Dombey,\r\nwhereon frosted Cupids offered scentless flowers to each of them, was\r\nallegorical to see.\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix was in great force, and looked astonishingly young. But\r\nhe was sometimes thoughtless in his good humour\xe2\x80\x94his memory occasionally\r\nwandering like his legs\xe2\x80\x94and on this occasion caused the company to\r\nshudder. It happened thus. The young lady with the back, who regarded\r\nCousin Feenix with sentiments of tenderness, had entrapped the East\r\nIndia Director into leading her to the chair next him; in return for\r\nwhich good office, she immediately abandoned the Director, who, being\r\nshaded on the other side by a gloomy black velvet hat surmounting a\r\nbony and speechless female with a fan, yielded to a depression of\r\nspirits and withdrew into himself. Cousin Feenix and the young lady\r\nwere very lively and humorous, and the young lady laughed so much at\r\nsomething Cousin Feenix related to her, that Major Bagstock begged\r\nleave to inquire on behalf of Mrs Skewton (they were sitting opposite,\r\na little lower down), whether that might not be considered public\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, upon my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it; it\r\nreally is not worth repeating: in point of fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s merely an\r\nanecdote of Jack Adams. I dare say my friend Dombey;\xe2\x80\x9d for the general\r\nattention was concentrated on Cousin Feenix; \xe2\x80\x9cmay remember Jack Adams,\r\nJack Adams, not Joe; that was his brother. Jack\xe2\x80\x94little Jack\xe2\x80\x94man with a\r\ncast in his eye, and slight impediment in his speech\xe2\x80\x94man who sat for\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s borough. We used to call him in my parliamentary time W. P.\r\nAdams, in consequence of his being Warming Pan for a young fellow who\r\nwas in his minority. Perhaps my friend Dombey may have known the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, who was as likely to have known Guy Fawkes, replied in the\r\nnegative. But one of the seven mild men unexpectedly leaped into\r\ndistinction, by saying he had known him, and adding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9calways wore\r\nHessian boots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, bending forward to see the mild man, and\r\nsmile encouragement at him down the table. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was Jack. Joe wore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTops!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mild man, rising in public estimation every Instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were intimate with em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew them both,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mild man. With whom Mr Dombey immediately\r\ntook wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevilish good fellow, Jack!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, again bending\r\nforward, and smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the mild man, becoming bold on his success. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\nof the best fellows I ever knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt you have heard the story?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the bold mild man, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I have heard your\r\nLudship tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, he leaned back in his chair and smiled at\r\nthe ceiling, as knowing it by heart, and being already tickled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn point of fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of a story in itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin\r\nFeenix, addressing the table with a smile, and a gay shake of his head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not worth a word of preface. But it\xe2\x80\x99s illustrative of the neatness\r\nof Jack\xe2\x80\x99s humour. The fact is, that Jack was invited down to a\r\nmarriage\xe2\x80\x94which I think took place in Berkshire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShropshire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bold mild man, finding himself appealed to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it? Well! In point of fact it might have been in any shire,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCousin Feenix. \xe2\x80\x9cSo my friend being invited down to this marriage in\r\nAnyshire,\xe2\x80\x9d with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke, \xe2\x80\x9cgoes.\r\nJust as some of us, having had the honour of being invited to the\r\nmarriage of my lovely and accomplished relative with my friend Dombey,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t require to be asked twice, and were devilish glad to be present\r\non so interesting an occasion.\xe2\x80\x94Goes\xe2\x80\x94Jack goes. Now, this marriage was,\r\nin point of fact, the marriage of an uncommonly fine girl with a man\r\nfor whom she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a button, but whom she accepted on account of\r\nhis property, which was immense. When Jack returned to town, after the\r\nnuptials, a man he knew, meeting him in the lobby of the House of\r\nCommons, says, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Jack, how are the ill-matched couple?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ill-matched,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jack \xe2\x80\x98Not at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly and equal\r\ntransaction. She is regularly bought, and you may take your oath he is\r\nas regularly sold!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his full enjoyment of this culminating point of his story, the\r\nshudder, which had gone all round the table like an electric spark,\r\nstruck Cousin Feenix, and he stopped. Not a smile occasioned by the\r\nonly general topic of conversation broached that day, appeared on any\r\nface. A profound silence ensued; and the wretched mild man, who had\r\nbeen as innocent of any real foreknowledge of the story as the child\r\nunborn, had the exquisite misery of reading in every eye that he was\r\nregarded as the prime mover of the mischief.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face was not a changeful one, and being cast in its mould\r\nof state that day, showed little other apprehension of the story, if\r\nany, than that which he expressed when he said solemnly, amidst the\r\nsilence, that it was \xe2\x80\x9cVery good.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a rapid glance from Edith\r\ntowards Florence, but otherwise she remained, externally, impassive and\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nThrough the various stages of rich meats and wines, continual gold and\r\nsilver, dainties of earth, air, fire, and water, heaped-up fruits, and\r\nthat unnecessary article in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s banquets\xe2\x80\x94ice\xe2\x80\x94the dinner slowly\r\nmade its way: the later stages being achieved to the sonorous music of\r\nincessant double knocks, announcing the arrival of visitors, whose\r\nportion of the feast was limited to the smell thereof. When Mrs Dombey\r\nrose, it was a sight to see her lord, with stiff throat and erect head,\r\nhold the door open for the withdrawal of the ladies; and to see how she\r\nswept past him with his daughter on her arm.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was a grave sight, behind the decanters, in a state of\r\ndignity; and the East India Director was a forlorn sight near the\r\nunoccupied end of the table, in a state of solitude; and the Major was\r\na military sight, relating stories of the Duke of York to six of the\r\nseven mild men (the ambitious one was utterly quenched); and the Bank\r\nDirector was a lowly sight, making a plan of his little attempt at a\r\npinery, with dessert-knives, for a group of admirers; and Cousin Feenix\r\nwas a thoughtful sight, as he smoothed his long wristbands and\r\nstealthily adjusted his wig. But all these sights were of short\r\nduration, being speedily broken up by coffee, and the desertion of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was a throng in the state-rooms upstairs, increasing every\r\nminute; but still Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list of visitors appeared to have some\r\nnative impossibility of amalgamation with Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list, and no one\r\ncould have doubted which was which. The single exception to this rule\r\nperhaps was Mr Carker, who now smiled among the company, and who, as he\r\nstood in the circle that was gathered about Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x94watchful of her,\r\nof them, his chief, Cleopatra and the Major, Florence, and everything\r\naround\xe2\x80\x94appeared at ease with both divisions of guests, and not marked\r\nas exclusively belonging to either.\r\n\r\nFlorence had a dread of him, which made his presence in the room a\r\nnightmare to her. She could not avoid the recollection of it, for her\r\neyes were drawn towards him every now and then, by an attraction of\r\ndislike and distrust that she could not resist. Yet her thoughts were\r\nbusy with other things; for as she sat apart\xe2\x80\x94not unadmired or unsought,\r\nbut in the gentleness of her quiet spirit\xe2\x80\x94she felt how little part her\r\nfather had in what was going on, and saw, with pain, how ill at ease he\r\nseemed to be, and how little regarded he was as he lingered about near\r\nthe door, for those visitors whom he wished to distinguish with\r\nparticular attention, and took them up to introduce them to his wife,\r\nwho received them with proud coldness, but showed no interest or wish\r\nto please, and never, after the bare ceremony of reception, in\r\nconsultation of his wishes, or in welcome of his friends, opened her\r\nlips. It was not the less perplexing or painful to Florence, that she\r\nwho acted thus, treated her so kindly and with such loving\r\nconsideration, that it almost seemed an ungrateful return on her part\r\neven to know of what was passing before her eyes.\r\n\r\nHappy Florence would have been, might she have ventured to bear her\r\nfather company, by so much as a look; and happy Florence was, in little\r\nsuspecting the main cause of his uneasiness. But afraid of seeming to\r\nknow that he was placed at any disadvantage, lest he should be\r\nresentful of that knowledge; and divided between her impulse towards\r\nhim, and her grateful affection for Edith; she scarcely dared to raise\r\nher eyes towards either. Anxious and unhappy for them both, the thought\r\nstole on her through the crowd, that it might have been better for them\r\nif this noise of tongues and tread of feet had never come there,\xe2\x80\x94if the\r\nold dulness and decay had never been replaced by novelty and\r\nsplendour,\xe2\x80\x94if the neglected child had found no friend in Edith, but had\r\nlived her solitary life, unpitied and forgotten.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick had some such thoughts too, but they were not so quietly\r\ndeveloped in her mind. This good matron had been outraged in the first\r\ninstance by not receiving an invitation to dinner. That blow partially\r\nrecovered, she had gone to a vast expense to make such a figure before\r\nMrs Dombey at home, as should dazzle the senses of that lady, and heap\r\nmortification, mountains high, on the head of Mrs Skewton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am made,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick to Mr Chick, \xe2\x80\x9cof no more account than\r\nFlorence! Who takes the smallest notice of me? No one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr Chick, who was seated by the side of Mrs\r\nChick against the wall, and could console himself, even there, by\r\nsoftly whistling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it at all appear as if I was wanted here?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Chick,\r\nwith flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul\xe2\x80\x99s mad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\nMr Chick whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you are a monster, which I sometimes think you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nChick with candour, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t sit there humming tunes. How anyone with the\r\nmost distant feelings of a man, can see that mother-in-law of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ndressed as she is, going on like that, with Major Bagstock, for whom,\r\namong other precious things, we are indebted to your Lucretia Tox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ Lucretia Tox, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Chick, astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Chick, with great severity, \xe2\x80\x9cyour Lucretia Tox\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsay how anybody can see that mother-in-law of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, and that haughty\r\nwife of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, and these indecent old frights with their backs and\r\nshoulders, and in short this at home generally, and hum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d on which word\r\nMrs Chick laid a scornful emphasis that made Mr Chick start, \xe2\x80\x9cis, I\r\nthank Heaven, a mystery to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Chick screwed his mouth into a form irreconcilable with humming or\r\nwhistling, and looked very contemplative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope I know what is due to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Chick, swelling\r\nwith indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cthough Paul has forgotten what is due to me. I am\r\nnot going to sit here, a member of this family, to be taken no notice\r\nof. I am not the dirt under Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s feet, yet\xe2\x80\x94not quite yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Chick, as if she expected to become so, about the day after\r\nto-morrow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall go. I will not say (whatever I may think) that\r\nthis affair has been got up solely to degrade and insult me. I shall\r\nmerely go. I shall not be missed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick rose erect with these words, and took the arm of Mr Chick,\r\nwho escorted her from the room, after half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s shady sojourn\r\nthere. And it is due to her penetration to observe that she certainly\r\nwas not missed at all.\r\n\r\nBut she was not the only indignant guest; for Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list (still\r\nconstantly in difficulties) were, as a body, indignant with Mrs\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s list, for looking at them through eyeglasses, and audibly\r\nwondering who all those people were; while Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s list complained\r\nof weariness, and the young thing with the shoulders, deprived of the\r\nattentions of that gay youth Cousin Feenix (who went away from the\r\ndinner-table), confidentially alleged to thirty or forty friends that\r\nshe was bored to death. All the old ladies with the burdens on their\r\nheads, had greater or less cause of complaint against Mr Dombey; and\r\nthe Directors and Chairmen coincided in thinking that if Dombey must\r\nmarry, he had better have married somebody nearer his own age, not\r\nquite so handsome, and a little better off. The general opinion among\r\nthis class of gentlemen was, that it was a weak thing in Dombey, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d live to repent it. Hardly anybody there, except the mild men,\r\nstayed, or went away, without considering himself or herself neglected\r\nand aggrieved by Mr Dombey or Mrs Dombey; and the speechless female in\r\nthe black velvet hat was found to have been stricken mute, because the\r\nlady in the crimson velvet had been handed down before her. The nature\r\neven of the mild men got corrupted, either from their curdling it with\r\ntoo much lemonade, or from the general inoculation that prevailed; and\r\nthey made sarcastic jokes to one another, and whispered disparagement\r\non stairs and in bye-places. The general dissatisfaction and discomfort\r\nso diffused itself, that the assembled footmen in the hall were as well\r\nacquainted with it as the company above. Nay, the very linkmen outside\r\ngot hold of it, and compared the party to a funeral out of mourning,\r\nwith none of the company remembered in the will.\r\n\r\nAt last, the guests were all gone, and the linkmen too; and the street,\r\ncrowded so long with carriages, was clear; and the dying lights showed\r\nno one in the rooms, but Mr Dombey and Mr Carker, who were talking\r\ntogether apart, and Mrs Dombey and her mother: the former seated on an\r\nottoman; the latter reclining in the Cleopatra attitude, awaiting the\r\narrival of her maid. Mr Dombey having finished his communication to\r\nCarker, the latter advanced obsequiously to take leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the fatigues of this delightful evening will\r\nnot inconvenience Mrs Dombey to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, advancing, \xe2\x80\x9chas sufficiently spared\r\nherself fatigue, to relieve you from any anxiety of that kind. I regret\r\nto say, Mrs Dombey, that I could have wished you had fatigued yourself\r\na little more on this occasion.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a supercilious glance, that it seemed not worth\r\nher while to protract, and turned away her eyes without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should not have thought\r\nit your duty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour duty, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cto have received my friends\r\nwith a little more deference. Some of those whom you have been pleased\r\nto slight tonight in a very marked manner, Mrs Dombey, confer a\r\ndistinction upon you, I must tell you, in any visit they pay you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that there is someone here?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, now looking at\r\nhim steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Carker! I beg that you do not. I insist that you do not,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr\r\nDombey, stopping that noiseless gentleman in his withdrawal. \xe2\x80\x9cMr\r\nCarker, Madam, as you know, possesses my confidence. He is as well\r\nacquainted as myself with the subject on which I speak. I beg to tell\r\nyou, for your information, Mrs Dombey, that I consider these wealthy\r\nand important persons confer a distinction upon me:\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr Dombey drew\r\nhimself up, as having now rendered them of the highest possible\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, bending her disdainful, steady gaze upon\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that there is someone here, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must entreat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, stepping forward, \xe2\x80\x9cI must beg, I must\r\ndemand, to be released. Slight and unimportant as this difference is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton, who had been intent upon her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face, took him up\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweetest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand my dearest Dombey; our excellent\r\nfriend Mr Carker, for so I am sure I ought to mention him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cToo much honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94has used the very words that were in my mind, and that I have been\r\ndying, these ages, for an opportunity of introducing. Slight and\r\nunimportant! My sweetest Edith, and my dearest Dombey, do we not know\r\nthat any difference between you two\xe2\x80\x94No, Flowers; not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlowers was the maid, who, finding gentlemen present, retreated with\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat any difference between you two,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the\r\nHeart you possess in common, and the excessively charming bond of\r\nfeeling that there is between you, must be slight and unimportant? What\r\nwords could better define the fact? None. Therefore I am glad to take\r\nthis slight occasion\xe2\x80\x94this trifling occasion, that is so replete with\r\nNature, and your individual characters, and all that\xe2\x80\x94so truly\r\ncalculated to bring the tears into a parent\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94to say that I attach\r\nno importance to them in the least, except as developing these minor\r\nelements of Soul; and that, unlike most Mamas-in-law (that odious\r\nphrase, dear Dombey!) as they have been represented to me to exist in\r\nthis I fear too artificial world, I never shall attempt to interpose\r\nbetween you, at such a time, and never can much regret, after all, such\r\nlittle flashes of the torch of What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\xe2\x80\x94not Cupid, but the other\r\ndelightful creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sharpness in the good mother\xe2\x80\x99s glance at both her children\r\nas she spoke, that may have been expressive of a direct and\r\nwell-considered purpose hidden between these rambling words. That\r\npurpose, providently to detach herself in the beginning from all the\r\nclankings of their chain that were to come, and to shelter herself with\r\nthe fiction of her innocent belief in their mutual affection, and their\r\nadaptation to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have pointed out to Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in his most stately\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in her conduct thus early in our married life, to which I\r\nobject, and which, I request, may be corrected. Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d with a nod of\r\ndismissal, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-night to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker bowed to the imperious form of the Bride, whose sparkling eye\r\nwas fixed upon her husband; and stopping at Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s couch on his\r\nway out, raised to his lips the hand she graciously extended to him, in\r\nlowly and admiring homage.\r\n\r\nIf his handsome wife had reproached him, or even changed countenance,\r\nor broken the silence in which she remained, by one word, now that they\r\nwere alone (for Cleopatra made off with all speed), Mr Dombey would\r\nhave been equal to some assertion of his case against her. But the\r\nintense, unutterable, withering scorn, with which, after looking upon\r\nhim, she dropped her eyes, as if he were too worthless and indifferent\r\nto her to be challenged with a syllable\xe2\x80\x94the ineffable disdain and\r\nhaughtiness in which she sat before him\xe2\x80\x94the cold inflexible resolve\r\nwith which her every feature seemed to bear him down, and put him\r\nby\xe2\x80\x94these, he had no resource against; and he left her, with her whole\r\noverbearing beauty concentrated on despising him.\r\n\r\nWas he coward enough to watch her, an hour afterwards, on the old well\r\nstaircase, where he had once seen Florence in the moonlight, toiling up\r\nwith Paul? Or was he in the dark by accident, when, looking up, he saw\r\nher coming, with a light, from the room where Florence lay, and marked\r\nagain the face so changed, which he could not subdue?\r\n\r\nBut it could never alter as his own did. It never, in its uttermost\r\npride and passion, knew the shadow that had fallen on his, in the dark\r\ncorner, on the night of the return; and often since; and which deepened\r\non it now, as he looked up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nMore Warnings than One\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence, Edith, and Mrs Skewton were together next day, and the\r\ncarriage was waiting at the door to take them out. For Cleopatra had\r\nher galley again now, and Withers, no longer the wan, stood upright in\r\na pigeon-breasted jacket and military trousers, behind her wheel-less\r\nchair at dinner-time and butted no more. The hair of Withers was\r\nradiant with pomatum, in these days of down, and he wore kid gloves and\r\nsmelt of the water of Cologne.\r\n\r\nThey were assembled in Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s room. The Serpent of old Nile (not\r\nto mention her disrespectfully) was reposing on her sofa, sipping her\r\nmorning chocolate at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, and Flowers the\r\nMaid was fastening on her youthful cuffs and frills, and performing a\r\nkind of private coronation ceremony on her, with a peach-coloured\r\nvelvet bonnet; the artificial roses in which nodded to uncommon\r\nadvantage, as the palsy trifled with them, like a breeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am a little nervous this morning, Flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nSkewton. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand quite shakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were the life of the party last night, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nFlowers, \xe2\x80\x9cand you suffer for it today, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, who had beckoned Florence to the window, and was looking out,\r\nwith her back turned on the toilet of her esteemed mother, suddenly\r\nwithdrew from it, as if it had lightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling child,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cleopatra, languidly, \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ are not nervous?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, my dear Edith, that you, so enviably self-possessed, are\r\nbeginning to be a martyr too, like your unfortunately constituted\r\nmother! Withers, someone at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCard, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Withers, taking it towards Mrs Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going out,\xe2\x80\x9d she said without looking at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear love,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9chow very odd to send that message\r\nwithout seeing the name! Bring it here, Withers. Dear me, my love; Mr\r\nCarker, too! That very sensible person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going out,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Edith, in so imperious a tone that Withers,\r\ngoing to the door, imperiously informed the servant who was waiting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey is going out. Get along with you,\xe2\x80\x9d and shut it on him.\r\n\r\nBut the servant came back after a short absence, and whispered to\r\nWithers again, who once more, and not very willingly, presented himself\r\nbefore Mrs Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Mr Carker sends his respectful compliments, and\r\nbegs you would spare him one minute, if you could\xe2\x80\x94for business, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nif you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton in her mildest manner; for her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s face was threatening; \xe2\x80\x9cif you would allow me to offer a\r\nword, I should recommend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow him this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. As Withers disappeared to execute the\r\ncommand, she added, frowning on her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cAs he comes at your\r\nrecommendation, let him come to your room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I\xe2\x80\x94shall I go away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, hurriedly.\r\n\r\nEdith nodded yes, but on her way to the door Florence met the visitor\r\ncoming in. With the same disagreeable mixture of familiarity and\r\nforbearance, with which he had first addressed her, he addressed her\r\nnow in his softest manner\xe2\x80\x94hoped she was quite well\xe2\x80\x94needed not to ask,\r\nwith such looks to anticipate the answer\xe2\x80\x94had scarcely had the honour to\r\nknow her, last night, she was so greatly changed\xe2\x80\x94and held the door open\r\nfor her to pass out; with a secret sense of power in her shrinking from\r\nhim, that all the deference and politeness of his manner could not\r\nquite conceal.\r\n\r\nHe then bowed himself for a moment over Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s condescending\r\nhand, and lastly bowed to Edith. Coldly returning his salute without\r\nlooking at him, and neither seating herself nor inviting him to be\r\nseated, she waited for him to speak.\r\n\r\nEntrenched in her pride and power, and with all the obduracy of her\r\nspirit summoned about her, still her old conviction that she and her\r\nmother had been known by this man in their worst colours, from their\r\nfirst acquaintance; that every degradation she had suffered in her own\r\neyes was as plain to him as to herself; that he read her life as though\r\nit were a vile book, and fluttered the leaves before her in slight\r\nlooks and tones of voice which no one else could detect; weakened and\r\nundermined her. Proudly as she opposed herself to him, with her\r\ncommanding face exacting his humility, her disdainful lip repulsing\r\nhim, her bosom angry at his intrusion, and the dark lashes of her eyes\r\nsullenly veiling their light, that no ray of it might shine upon\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and submissively as he stood before her, with an entreating injured\r\nmanner, but with complete submission to her will\xe2\x80\x94she knew, in her own\r\nsoul, that the cases were reversed, and that the triumph and\r\nsuperiority were his, and that he knew it full well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have presumed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cto solicit an interview, and I have\r\nventured to describe it as being one of business, because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are charged by Mr Dombey with some message of reproof,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Edith \xe2\x80\x9cYou possess Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in such an unusual\r\ndegree, Sir, that you would scarcely surprise me if that were your\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no message to the lady who sheds a lustre upon his name,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I entreat that lady, on my own behalf, to be just to a\r\nvery humble claimant for justice at her hands\xe2\x80\x94a mere dependant of Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94which is a position of humility; and to reflect upon my\r\nperfect helplessness last night, and the impossibility of my avoiding\r\nthe share that was forced upon me in a very painful occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d hinted Cleopatra in a low voice, as she held her\r\neye-glass aside, \xe2\x80\x9creally very charming of Mr What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name. And full\r\nof heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, appealing to Mrs Skewton with a look of\r\ngrateful deference,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do venture to call it a painful occasion, though\r\nmerely because it was so to me, who had the misfortune to be present.\r\nSo slight a difference, as between the principals\xe2\x80\x94between those who\r\nlove each other with disinterested devotion, and would make any\r\nsacrifice of self in such a cause\xe2\x80\x94is nothing. As Mrs Skewton herself\r\nexpressed, with so much truth and feeling last night, it is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith could not look at him, but she said after a few moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your business, Sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my pet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9call this time Mr Carker is\r\nstanding! My dear Mr Carker, take a seat, I beg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered no reply to the mother, but fixed his eyes on the proud\r\ndaughter, as though he would only be bidden by her, and was resolved to\r\nbe bidden by her. Edith, in spite of herself, sat down, and slightly\r\nmotioned with her hand to him to be seated too. No action could be\r\ncolder, haughtier, more insolent in its air of supremacy and\r\ndisrespect, but she had struggled against even that concession\r\nineffectually, and it was wrested from her. That was enough! Mr Carker\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be allowed, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, turning his white teeth on Mrs\r\nSkewton like a light\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca lady of your excellent sense and quick feeling\r\nwill give me credit, for good reason, I am sure\xe2\x80\x94to address what I have\r\nto say, to Mrs Dombey, and to leave her to impart it to you who are her\r\nbest and dearest friend\xe2\x80\x94next to Mr Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton would have retired, but Edith stopped her. Edith would have\r\nstopped him too, and indignantly ordered him to speak openly or not at\r\nall, but that he said, in a low Voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence\xe2\x80\x94the young lady who\r\nhas just left the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith suffered him to proceed. She looked at him now. As he bent\r\nforward, to be nearer, with the utmost show of delicacy and respect,\r\nand with his teeth persuasively arrayed, in a self-depreciating smile,\r\nshe felt as if she could have struck him dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence\xe2\x80\x99s position,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9chas been an unfortunate one. I\r\nhave a difficulty in alluding to it to you, whose attachment to her\r\nfather is naturally watchful and jealous of every word that applies to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d Always distinct and soft in speech, no language could describe\r\nthe extent of his distinctness and softness, when he said these words,\r\nor came to any others of a similar import. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, as one who is devoted\r\nto Mr Dombey in his different way, and whose life is passed in\r\nadmiration of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s character, may I say, without offence to your\r\ntenderness as a wife, that Miss Florence has unhappily been\r\nneglected\xe2\x80\x94by her father. May I say by her father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, with a great appearance of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nremoves a mountain from my breast. May I hope you know how the neglect\r\noriginated; in what an amiable phase of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s pride\xe2\x80\x94character I\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may pass that by, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cand come the sooner to the\r\nend of what you have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I am sensible, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carker,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctrust me, I am deeply\r\nsensible, that Mr Dombey can require no justification in anything to\r\nyou. But, kindly judge of my breast by your own, and you will forgive\r\nmy interest in him, if in its excess, it goes at all astray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a stab to her proud heart, to sit there, face to face with him,\r\nand have him tendering her false oath at the altar again and again for\r\nher acceptance, and pressing it upon her like the dregs of a sickening\r\ncup she could not own her loathing of, or turn away from! How shame,\r\nremorse, and passion raged within her, when, upright and majestic in\r\nher beauty before him, she knew that in her spirit she was down at his\r\nfeet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cleft to the care\xe2\x80\x94if one may call it\r\ncare\xe2\x80\x94of servants and mercenary people, in every way her inferiors,\r\nnecessarily wanted some guide and compass in her younger days, and,\r\nnaturally, for want of them, has been indiscreet, and has in some\r\ndegree forgotten her station. There was some folly about one Walter, a\r\ncommon lad, who is fortunately dead now: and some very undesirable\r\nassociation, I regret to say, with certain coasting sailors, of\r\nanything but good repute, and a runaway old bankrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard the circumstances, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, flashing her\r\ndisdainful glance upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know that you pervert them. You may\r\nnot know it. I hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that nobody knows them so well\r\nas I. Your generous and ardent nature, Madam\xe2\x80\x94the same nature which is\r\nso nobly imperative in vindication of your beloved and honoured\r\nhusband, and which has blessed him as even his merits deserve\xe2\x80\x94I must\r\nrespect, defer to, bow before. But, as regards the circumstances, which\r\nis indeed the business I presumed to solicit your attention to, I can\r\nhave no doubt, since, in the execution of my trust as Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidential\xe2\x80\x94I presume to say\xe2\x80\x94friend, I have fully ascertained them. In\r\nmy execution of that trust; in my deep concern, which you can so well\r\nunderstand, for everything relating to him, intensified, if you will\r\n(for I fear I labour under your displeasure), by the lower motive of\r\ndesire to prove my diligence, and make myself the more acceptable; I\r\nhave long pursued these circumstances by myself and trustworthy\r\ninstruments, and have innumerable and most minute proofs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes no higher than his mouth, but she saw the means of\r\nmischief vaunted in every tooth it contained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif in my perplexity, I presume to\r\ntake counsel with you, and to consult your pleasure. I think I have\r\nobserved that you are greatly interested in Miss Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was there in her he had not observed, and did not know? Humbled\r\nand yet maddened by the thought, in every new presentment of it,\r\nhowever faint, she pressed her teeth upon her quivering lip to force\r\ncomposure on it, and distantly inclined her head in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis interest, Madam\xe2\x80\x94so touching an evidence of everything associated\r\nwith Mr Dombey being dear to you\xe2\x80\x94induces me to pause before I make him\r\nacquainted with these circumstances, which, as yet, he does not know.\r\nIt so shakes me, if I may make the confession, in my allegiance, that\r\non the intimation of the least desire to that effect from you, I would\r\nsuppress them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith raised her head quickly, and starting back, bent her dark glance\r\nupon him. He met it with his blandest and most deferential smile, and\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that as I describe them, they are perverted. I fear not\xe2\x80\x94I fear\r\nnot: but let us assume that they are. The uneasiness I have for some\r\ntime felt on the subject, arises in this: that the mere circumstance of\r\nsuch association often repeated, on the part of Miss Florence, however\r\ninnocently and confidingly, would be conclusive with Mr Dombey, already\r\npredisposed against her, and would lead him to take some step (I know\r\nhe has occasionally contemplated it) of separation and alienation of\r\nher from his home. Madam, bear with me, and remember my intercourse\r\nwith Mr Dombey, and my knowledge of him, and my reverence for him,\r\nalmost from childhood, when I say that if he has a fault, it is a lofty\r\nstubbornness, rooted in that noble pride and sense of power which\r\nbelong to him, and which we must all defer to; which is not assailable\r\nlike the obstinacy of other characters; and which grows upon itself\r\nfrom day to day, and year to year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her glance upon him still; but, look as steadfast as she\r\nwould, her haughty nostrils dilated, and her breath came somewhat\r\ndeeper, and her lip would slightly curl, as he described that in his\r\npatron to which they must all bow down. He saw it; and though his\r\nexpression did not change, she knew he saw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so slight an incident as last night\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I might\r\nrefer to it once more, would serve to illustrate my meaning, better\r\nthan a greater one. Dombey and Son know neither time, nor place, nor\r\nseason, but bear them all down. But I rejoice in its occurrence, for it\r\nhas opened the way for me to approach Mrs Dombey with this subject\r\ntoday, even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary\r\ndispleasure. Madam, in the midst of my uneasiness and apprehension on\r\nthis subject, I was summoned by Mr Dombey to Leamington. There I saw\r\nyou. There I could not help knowing what relation you would shortly\r\noccupy towards him\xe2\x80\x94to his enduring happiness and yours. There I\r\nresolved to await the time of your establishment at home here, and to\r\ndo as I have now done. I have, at heart, no fear that I shall be\r\nwanting in my duty to Mr Dombey, if I bury what I know in your breast;\r\nfor where there is but one heart and mind between two persons\xe2\x80\x94as in\r\nsuch a marriage\xe2\x80\x94one almost represents the other. I can acquit my\r\nconscience therefore, almost equally, by confidence, on such a theme,\r\nin you or him. For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you. May\r\nI aspire to the distinction of believing that my confidence is\r\naccepted, and that I am relieved from my responsibility?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe long remembered the look she gave him\xe2\x80\x94who could see it, and forget\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94and the struggle that ensued within her. At last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept it, Sir You will please to consider this matter at an end,\r\nand that it goes no farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed low, and rose. She rose too, and he took leave with all\r\nhumility. But Withers, meeting him on the stairs, stood amazed at the\r\nbeauty of his teeth, and at his brilliant smile; and as he rode away\r\nupon his white-legged horse, the people took him for a dentist, such\r\nwas the dazzling show he made. The people took her, when she rode out\r\nin her carriage presently, for a great lady, as happy as she was rich\r\nand fine. But they had not seen her, just before, in her own room with\r\nno one by; and they had not heard her utterance of the three words, \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nFlorence, Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton, reposing on her sofa, and sipping her chocolate, had heard\r\nnothing but the low word business, for which she had a mortal aversion,\r\ninsomuch that she had long banished it from her vocabulary, and had\r\ngone nigh, in a charming manner and with an immense amount of heart, to\r\nsay nothing of soul, to ruin divers milliners and others in\r\nconsequence. Therefore Mrs Skewton asked no questions, and showed no\r\ncuriosity. Indeed, the peach-velvet bonnet gave her sufficient\r\noccupation out of doors; for being perched on the back of her head, and\r\nthe day being rather windy, it was frantic to escape from Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, and would be coaxed into no sort of compromise. When the\r\ncarriage was closed, and the wind shut out, the palsy played among the\r\nartificial roses again like an almshouse-full of superannuated zephyrs;\r\nand altogether Mrs Skewton had enough to do, and got on but\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\nShe got on no better towards night; for when Mrs Dombey, in her\r\ndressing-room, had been dressed and waiting for her half an hour, and\r\nMr Dombey, in the drawing-room, had paraded himself into a state of\r\nsolemn fretfulness (they were all three going out to dinner), Flowers\r\nthe Maid appeared with a pale face to Mrs Dombey, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I beg your pardon, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing with\r\nMissis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the frightened maid, \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaking faces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith hurried with her to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room. Cleopatra was arrayed in\r\nfull dress, with the diamonds, short sleeves, rouge, curls, teeth, and\r\nother juvenility all complete; but Paralysis was not to be deceived,\r\nhad known her for the object of its errand, and had struck her at her\r\nglass, where she lay like a horrible doll that had tumbled down.\r\n\r\nThey took her to pieces in very shame, and put the little of her that\r\nwas real on a bed. Doctors were sent for, and soon came. Powerful\r\nremedies were resorted to; opinions given that she would rally from\r\nthis shock, but would not survive another; and there she lay\r\nspeechless, and staring at the ceiling, for days; sometimes making\r\ninarticulate sounds in answer to such questions as did she know who\r\nwere present, and the like: sometimes giving no reply either by sign or\r\ngesture, or in her unwinking eyes.\r\n\r\nAt length she began to recover consciousness, and in some degree the\r\npower of motion, though not yet of speech. One day the use of her right\r\nhand returned; and showing it to her maid who was in attendance on her,\r\nand appearing very uneasy in her mind, she made signs for a pencil and\r\nsome paper. This the maid immediately provided, thinking she was going\r\nto make a will, or write some last request; and Mrs Dombey being from\r\nhome, the maid awaited the result with solemn feelings.\r\n\r\nAfter much painful scrawling and erasing, and putting in of wrong\r\ncharacters, which seemed to tumble out of the pencil of their own\r\naccord, the old woman produced this document:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose-coloured curtains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid being perfectly transfixed, and with tolerable reason,\r\nCleopatra amended the manuscript by adding two words more, when it\r\nstood thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose-coloured curtains for doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid now perceived remotely that she wished these articles to be\r\nprovided for the better presentation of her complexion to the faculty;\r\nand as those in the house who knew her best, had no doubt of the\r\ncorrectness of this opinion, which she was soon able to establish for\r\nherself, the rose-coloured curtains were added to her bed, and she\r\nmended with increased rapidity from that hour. She was soon able to sit\r\nup, in curls and a laced cap and nightgown, and to have a little\r\nartificial bloom dropped into the hollow caverns of her cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous sight to see this old woman in her finery leering\r\nand mincing at Death, and playing off her youthful tricks upon him as\r\nif he had been the Major; but an alteration in her mind that ensued on\r\nthe paralytic stroke was fraught with as much matter for reflection,\r\nand was quite as ghastly.\r\n\r\nWhether the weakening of her intellect made her more cunning and false\r\nthan before, or whether it confused her between what she had assumed to\r\nbe and what she really had been, or whether it had awakened any\r\nglimmering of remorse, which could neither struggle into light nor get\r\nback into total darkness, or whether, in the jumble of her faculties, a\r\ncombination of these effects had been shaken up, which is perhaps the\r\nmore likely supposition, the result was this:\xe2\x80\x94That she became hugely\r\nexacting in respect of Edith\xe2\x80\x99s affection and gratitude and attention to\r\nher; highly laudatory of herself as a most inestimable parent; and very\r\njealous of having any rival in Edith\xe2\x80\x99s regard. Further, in place of\r\nremembering that compact made between them for an avoidance of the\r\nsubject, she constantly alluded to her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage as a proof\r\nof her being an incomparable mother; and all this, with the weakness\r\nand peevishness of such a state, always serving for a sarcastic\r\ncommentary on her levity and youthfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to her maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out! Does she go out to shun her Mama, Flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa bless you, no, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Mrs Dombey has only gone out for a ride with\r\nMiss Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Florence. Who\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Florence? Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about Miss Florence.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Florence to her, compared to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apposite display of the diamonds, or the peach-velvet bonnet (she\r\nsat in the bonnet to receive visitors, weeks before she could stir out\r\nof doors), or the dressing of her up in some gaud or other, usually\r\nstopped the tears that began to flow hereabouts; and she would remain\r\nin a complacent state until Edith came to see her; when, at a glance of\r\nthe proud face, she would relapse again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am sure, Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d she would cry, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter! I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is the matter. The world is coming to\r\nsuch an artificial and ungrateful state, that I begin to think there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno Heart\xe2\x80\x94or anything of that sort\xe2\x80\x94left in it, positively. Withers is\r\nmore a child to me than you are. He attends to me much more than my own\r\ndaughter. I almost wish I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look so young\xe2\x80\x94and all that kind of\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94and then perhaps I should be more considered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a great deal, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything you want that you have not? It is your own fault if\r\nthere be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own fault!\xe2\x80\x9d beginning to whimper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe parent I have been to you,\r\nEdith: making you a companion from your cradle! And when you neglect\r\nme, and have no more natural affection for me than if I was a\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x94not a twentieth part of the affection that you have for\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x94but I am only your mother, and should corrupt her in a\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x94you reproach me with its being my own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, mother, I reproach you with nothing. Why will you always dwell\r\non this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it natural that I should dwell on this, when I am all affection\r\nand sensitiveness, and am wounded in the cruellest way, whenever you\r\nlook at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not mean to wound you, mother. Have you no remembrance of what\r\nhas been said between us? Let the Past rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rest! And let gratitude to me rest; and let affection for me\r\nrest; and let me rest in my out-of-the-way room, with no society and no\r\nattention, while you find new relations to make much of, who have no\r\nearthly claim upon you! Good gracious, Edith, do you know what an\r\nelegant establishment you are at the head of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Hush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that gentlemanly creature, Dombey? Do you know that you are\r\nmarried to him, Edith, and that you have a settlement and a position,\r\nand a carriage, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I know it, mother; well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you would have had with that delightful good soul\xe2\x80\x94what did they\r\ncall him?\xe2\x80\x94Granger\xe2\x80\x94if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t died. And who have you to thank for all\r\nthis, Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, mother; you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen put your arms round my neck, and kiss me; and show me, Edith,\r\nthat you know there never was a better Mama than I have been to you.\r\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t let me become a perfect fright with teasing and wearing\r\nmyself at your ingratitude, or when I\xe2\x80\x99m out again in society no soul\r\nwill know me, not even that hateful animal, the Major.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, sometimes, when Edith went nearer to her, and bending down her\r\nstately head, put her cold cheek to hers, the mother would draw back as\r\nIf she were afraid of her, and would fall into a fit of trembling, and\r\ncry out that there was a wandering in her wits. And sometimes she would\r\nentreat her, with humility, to sit down on the chair beside her bed,\r\nand would look at her (as she sat there brooding) with a face that even\r\nthe rose-coloured curtains could not make otherwise than scared and\r\nwild.\r\n\r\nThe rose-coloured curtains blushed, in course of time, on Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbodily recovery, and on her dress\xe2\x80\x94more juvenile than ever, to repair\r\nthe ravages of illness\xe2\x80\x94and on the rouge, and on the teeth, and on the\r\ncurls, and on the diamonds, and the short sleeves, and the whole\r\nwardrobe of the doll that had tumbled down before the mirror. They\r\nblushed, too, now and then, upon an indistinctness in her speech which\r\nshe turned off with a girlish giggle, and on an occasional failing in\r\nher memory, that had no rule in it, but came and went fantastically, as\r\nif in mockery of her fantastic self.\r\n\r\nBut they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought\r\nand speech towards her daughter. And though that daughter often came\r\nwithin their influence, they never blushed upon her loveliness\r\nirradiated by a smile, or softened by the light of filial love, in its\r\nstern beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nMiss Tox improves an Old Acquaintance\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forlorn Miss Tox, abandoned by her friend Louisa Chick, and bereft\r\nof Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s countenance\xe2\x80\x94for no delicate pair of wedding cards,\r\nunited by a silver thread, graced the chimney-glass in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPlace, or the harpsichord, or any of those little posts of display\r\nwhich Lucretia reserved for holiday occupation\xe2\x80\x94became depressed in her\r\nspirits, and suffered much from melancholy. For a time the Bird Waltz\r\nwas unheard in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, the plants were neglected, and dust\r\ncollected on the miniature of Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s ancestor with the powdered\r\nhead and pigtail.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, however, was not of an age or of a disposition long to\r\nabandon herself to unavailing regrets. Only two notes of the\r\nharpsichord were dumb from disuse when the Bird Waltz again warbled and\r\ntrilled in the crooked drawing-room: only one slip of geranium fell a\r\nvictim to imperfect nursing, before she was gardening at her green\r\nbaskets again, regularly every morning; the powdered-headed ancestor\r\nhad not been under a cloud for more than six weeks, when Miss Tox\r\nbreathed on his benignant visage, and polished him up with a piece of\r\nwash-leather.\r\n\r\nStill, Miss Tox was lonely, and at a loss. Her attachments, however\r\nludicrously shown, were real and strong; and she was, as she expressed\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply hurt by the unmerited contumely she had met with from\r\nLouisa.\xe2\x80\x9d But there was no such thing as anger in Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposition. If she had ambled on through life, in her soft spoken way,\r\nwithout any opinions, she had, at least, got so far without any harsh\r\npassions. The mere sight of Louisa Chick in the street one day, at a\r\nconsiderable distance, so overpowered her milky nature, that she was\r\nfain to seek immediate refuge in a pastrycook\xe2\x80\x99s, and there, in a musty\r\nlittle back room usually devoted to the consumption of soups, and\r\npervaded by an ox-tail atmosphere, relieve her feelings by weeping\r\nplentifully.\r\n\r\nAgainst Mr Dombey Miss Tox hardly felt that she had any reason of\r\ncomplaint. Her sense of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s magnificence was such, that\r\nonce removed from him, she felt as if her distance always had been\r\nimmeasurable, and as if he had greatly condescended in tolerating her\r\nat all. No wife could be too handsome or too stately for him, according\r\nto Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s sincere opinion. It was perfectly natural that in looking\r\nfor one, he should look high. Miss Tox with tears laid down this\r\nproposition, and fully admitted it, twenty times a day. She never\r\nrecalled the lofty manner in which Mr Dombey had made her subservient\r\nto his convenience and caprices, and had graciously permitted her to be\r\none of the nurses of his little son. She only thought, in her own\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she had passed a great many happy hours in that house,\r\nwhich she must ever remember with gratification, and that she could\r\nnever cease to regard Mr Dombey as one of the most impressive and\r\ndignified of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCut off, however, from the implacable Louisa, and being shy of the\r\nMajor (whom she viewed with some distrust now), Miss Tox found it very\r\nirksome to know nothing of what was going on in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestablishment. And as she really had got into the habit of considering\r\nDombey and Son as the pivot on which the world in general turned, she\r\nresolved, rather than be ignorant of intelligence which so strongly\r\ninterested her, to cultivate her old acquaintance, Mrs Richards, who\r\nshe knew, since her last memorable appearance before Mr Dombey, was in\r\nthe habit of sometimes holding communication with his servants. Perhaps\r\nMiss Tox, in seeking out the Toodle family, had the tender motive\r\nhidden in her breast of having somebody to whom she could talk about Mr\r\nDombey, no matter how humble that somebody might be.\r\n\r\nAt all events, towards the Toodle habitation Miss Tox directed her\r\nsteps one evening, what time Mr Toodle, cindery and swart, was\r\nrefreshing himself with tea, in the bosom of his family. Mr Toodle had\r\nonly three stages of existence. He was either taking refreshment in the\r\nbosom just mentioned, or he was tearing through the country at from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty miles an hour, or he was sleeping after his\r\nfatigues. He was always in a whirlwind or a calm, and a peaceable,\r\ncontented, easy-going man Mr Toodle was in either state, who seemed to\r\nhave made over all his own inheritance of fuming and fretting to the\r\nengines with which he was connected, which panted, and gasped, and\r\nchafed, and wore themselves out, in a most unsparing manner, while Mr\r\nToodle led a mild and equable life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly, my gal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle, with a young Toodle on each knee, and\r\ntwo more making tea for him, and plenty more scattered about\xe2\x80\x94Mr Toodle\r\nwas never out of children, but always kept a good supply on hand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t seen our Biler lately, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s almost certain to look in tonight. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis right evening, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very regular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle, relishing his meal infinitely, \xe2\x80\x9cas our\r\nBiler is a doin\xe2\x80\x99 now about as well as a boy can do, eh, Polly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he\xe2\x80\x99s a doing beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t got to be at all secret-like\xe2\x80\x94has he, Polly?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr\r\nToodle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Toodle, plumply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got to be at all secret-like, Polly,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr\r\nToodle in his slow and measured way, and shovelling in his bread and\r\nbutter with a clasp knife, as if he were stoking himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look well; do it, Polly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course it don\xe2\x80\x99t, father. How can you ask!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my boys and gals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle, looking round upon his\r\nfamily, \xe2\x80\x9cwotever you\xe2\x80\x99re up to in a honest way, it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion as you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do better than be open. If you find yourselves in cuttings or in\r\ntunnels, don\xe2\x80\x99t you play no secret games. Keep your whistles going, and\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s know where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rising Toodles set up a shrill murmur, expressive of their\r\nresolution to profit by the paternal advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what makes you say this along of Rob, father?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his wife,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly, old \xe2\x80\x9cooman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I said it\r\npartickler along o\xe2\x80\x99 Rob, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I starts light with Rob only; I\r\ncomes to a branch; I takes on what I finds there; and a whole train of\r\nideas gets coupled on to him, afore I knows where I am, or where they\r\ncomes from. What a Junction a man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto-be-sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis profound reflection Mr Toodle washed down with a pint mug of tea,\r\nand proceeded to solidify with a great weight of bread and butter;\r\ncharging his young daughters meanwhile, to keep plenty of hot water in\r\nthe pot, as he was uncommon dry, and should take the indefinite\r\nquantity of \xe2\x80\x9ca sight of mugs,\xe2\x80\x9d before his thirst was appeased.\r\n\r\nIn satisfying himself, however, Mr Toodle was not regardless of the\r\nyounger branches about him, who, although they had made their own\r\nevening repast, were on the look-out for irregular morsels, as\r\npossessing a relish. These he distributed now and then to the expectant\r\ncircle, by holding out great wedges of bread and butter, to be bitten\r\nat by the family in lawful succession, and by serving out small doses\r\nof tea in like manner with a spoon; which snacks had such a relish in\r\nthe mouths of these young Toodles, that, after partaking of the same,\r\nthey performed private dances of ecstasy among themselves, and stood on\r\none leg apiece, and hopped, and indulged in other saltatory tokens of\r\ngladness. These vents for their excitement found, they gradually closed\r\nabout Mr Toodle again, and eyed him hard as he got through more bread\r\nand butter and tea; affecting, however, to have no further expectations\r\nof their own in reference to those viands, but to be conversing on\r\nforeign subjects, and whispering confidentially.\r\n\r\nMr Toodle, in the midst of this family group, and setting an awful\r\nexample to his children in the way of appetite, was conveying the two\r\nyoung Toodles on his knees to Birmingham by special engine, and was\r\ncontemplating the rest over a barrier of bread and butter, when Rob the\r\nGrinder, in his sou\xe2\x80\x99wester hat and mourning slops, presented himself,\r\nand was received with a general rush of brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, dutifully kissing her; \xe2\x80\x9chow are you, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Polly, giving him a hug and a pat on the back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecret! Bless you, father, not he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was intended for Mr Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s private edification, but Rob the\r\nGrinder, whose withers were not unwrung, caught the words as they were\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! father\xe2\x80\x99s been a saying something more again me, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe injured innocent. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a hard thing it is that when a cove has\r\nonce gone a little wrong, a cove\xe2\x80\x99s own father should be always a\r\nthrowing it in his face behind his back! It\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob,\r\nresorting to his coat-cuff in anguish of spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cto make a cove go and\r\ndo something, out of spite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cfather didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf father didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything,\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered the injured Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\ndid he go and say anything, mother? Nobody thinks half so bad of me as\r\nmy own father does. What a unnatural thing! I wish somebody\xe2\x80\x99d take and\r\nchop my head off. Father wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind doing it, I believe, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmuch rather he did that than t\xe2\x80\x99other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these desperate words all the young Toodles shrieked; a pathetic\r\neffect, which the Grinder improved by ironically adjuring them not to\r\ncry for him, for they ought to hate him, they ought, if they was good\r\nboys and girls; and this so touched the youngest Toodle but one, who\r\nwas easily moved, that it touched him not only in his spirit but in his\r\nwind too; making him so purple that Mr Toodle in consternation carried\r\nhim out to the water-butt, and would have put him under the tap, but\r\nfor his being recovered by the sight of that instrument.\r\n\r\nMatters having reached this point, Mr Toodle explained, and the\r\nvirtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed, they shook hands,\r\nand harmony reigned again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do as I do, Biler, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired his father, returning to\r\nhis tea with new strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, father. Master and I had tea together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how _is_ master, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, mother; not much to boast on. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nbis\xe2\x80\x99ness done, you see. He don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it\xe2\x80\x94the Cap\xe2\x80\x99en\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. There was a man come into the shop this very day, and says, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwant a so-and-so,\xe2\x80\x99 he says\xe2\x80\x94some hard name or another. \xe2\x80\x98A which?\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nthe Cap\xe2\x80\x99en. \xe2\x80\x98A so-and-so,\xe2\x80\x99 says the man. \xe2\x80\x98Brother,\xe2\x80\x99 says the Cap\xe2\x80\x99en,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98will you take a observation round the shop.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says the man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do you see wot you want?\xe2\x80\x99 says the Cap\xe2\x80\x99en \xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays the man. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know it wen you _do_ see it?\xe2\x80\x99 says the Cap\xe2\x80\x99en.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 says the man. \xe2\x80\x98Why, then I tell you wot, my lad,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nthe Cap\xe2\x80\x99en, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99d better go back and ask wot it\xe2\x80\x99s like, outside, for\r\nno more don\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t the way to make money, though, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney, mother! He\xe2\x80\x99ll never make money. He has such ways as I never\r\nsee. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bad master though, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that for him. But that\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t much to me, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall stop with him long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot stop in your place, Rob!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his mother; while Mr Toodle opened\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in that place, p\xe2\x80\x99raps,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder, with a wink. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\xe2\x80\x94friends at court you know\xe2\x80\x94but never _you_ mind,\r\nmother, just now; I\xe2\x80\x99m all right, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe indisputable proof afforded in these hints, and in the Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmysterious manner, of his not being subject to that failing which Mr\r\nToodle had, by implication, attributed to him, might have led to a\r\nrenewal of his wrongs, and of the sensation in the family, but for the\r\nopportune arrival of another visitor, who, to Polly\xe2\x80\x99s great surprise,\r\nappeared at the door, smiling patronage and friendship on all there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mrs Richards?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to see you.\r\nMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cheery face of Mrs Richards shone with a hospitable reply, and Miss\r\nTox, accepting the proffered chair, and gracefully recognising Mr\r\nToodle on her way to it, untied her bonnet strings, and said that in\r\nthe first place she must beg the dear children, one and all, to come\r\nand kiss her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ill-starred youngest Toodle but one, who would appear, from the\r\nfrequency of his domestic troubles, to have been born under an unlucky\r\nplanet, was prevented from performing his part in this general\r\nsalutation by having fixed the sou\xe2\x80\x99wester hat (with which he had been\r\npreviously trifling) deep on his head, hind side before, and being\r\nunable to get it off again; which accident presenting to his terrified\r\nimagination a dismal picture of his passing the rest of his days in\r\ndarkness, and in hopeless seclusion from his friends and family, caused\r\nhim to struggle with great violence, and to utter suffocating cries.\r\nBeing released, his face was discovered to be very hot, and red, and\r\ndamp; and Miss Tox took him on her lap, much exhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have almost forgotten me, Sir, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox to Mr\r\nToodle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve all on us got a little older\r\nsince then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you find yourself, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miss Tox, blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearty, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ find\r\n_your_self, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Do the rheumaticks keep off pretty well, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am? We\r\nmust all expect to grow into \xe2\x80\x99em, as we gets on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not felt any inconvenience from\r\nthat disorder yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wery fortunate, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cMany people at\r\nyour time of life, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, is martyrs to it. There was my mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\ncatching his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eye here, Mr Toodle judiciously buried the rest in\r\nanother mug of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never mean to say, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Tox, looking at Rob,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat that is your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEldest, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s the little\r\nfellow, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that was the innocent cause of so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis here, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cis him with the short legs\xe2\x80\x94and they\r\nwas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle, with a touch of poetry in his tone, \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\r\nshort for leathers\xe2\x80\x94as Mr Dombey made a Grinder on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe recollection almost overpowered Miss Tox. The subject of it had a\r\npeculiar interest for her directly. She asked him to shake hands, and\r\ncongratulated his mother on his frank, ingenuous face. Rob, overhearing\r\nher, called up a look, to justify the eulogium, but it was hardly the\r\nright look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand you too, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing\r\nToodle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, plainly and truly, what I have come here for.\r\nYou may be aware, Mrs Richards\xe2\x80\x94and, possibly, you may be aware too,\r\nSir\xe2\x80\x94that a little distance has interposed itself between me and some of\r\nmy friends, and that where I used to visit a good deal, I do not visit\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly, who, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tact, understood this at once, expressed as\r\nmuch in a little look. Mr Toodle, who had not the faintest idea of what\r\nMiss Tox was talking about, expressed that also, in a stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9chow our little coolness has arisen is of\r\nno moment, and does not require to be discussed. It is sufficient for\r\nme to say, that I have the greatest possible respect for, and interest\r\nin, Mr Dombey;\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s voice faltered; \xe2\x80\x9cand everything that relates\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toodle, enlightened, shook his head, and said he had heerd it said,\r\nand, for his own part, he did think, as Mr Dombey was a difficult\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Sir, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\nentreat you not to say so, Sir, either now, or at any future time. Such\r\nobservations cannot but be very painful to me; and to a gentleman,\r\nwhose mind is constituted as, I am quite sure, yours is, can afford no\r\npermanent satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toodle, who had not entertained the least doubt of offering a remark\r\nthat would be received with acquiescence, was greatly confounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I wish to say, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miss Tox,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\naddress myself to you too, Sir,\xe2\x80\x94is this. That any intelligence of the\r\nproceedings of the family, of the welfare of the family, of the health\r\nof the family, that reaches you, will be always most acceptable to me.\r\nThat I shall be always very glad to chat with Mrs Richards about the\r\nfamily, and about old time. And as Mrs Richards and I never had the\r\nleast difference (though I could wish now that we had been better\r\nacquainted, but I have no one but myself to blame for that), I hope she\r\nwill not object to our being very good friends now, and to my coming\r\nbackwards and forwards here, when I like, without being a stranger.\r\nNow, I really hope, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwill take this, as I mean it, like a good-humoured creature, as you\r\nalways were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly was gratified, and showed it. Mr Toodle didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he\r\nwas gratified or not, and preserved a stolid calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Mrs Richards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I hope you see too,\r\nSir\xe2\x80\x94there are many little ways in which I can be slightly useful to\r\nyou, if you will make no stranger of me; and in which I shall be\r\ndelighted to be so. For instance, I can teach your children something.\r\nI shall bring a few little books, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, and some work,\r\nand of an evening now and then, they\xe2\x80\x99ll learn\xe2\x80\x94dear me, they\xe2\x80\x99ll learn a\r\ngreat deal, I trust, and be a credit to their teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toodle, who had a great respect for learning, jerked his head\r\napprovingly at his wife, and moistened his hands with dawning\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, not being a stranger, I shall be in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nTox, \xe2\x80\x9cand everything will go on just as if I were not here. Mrs\r\nRichards will do her mending, or her ironing, or her nursing, whatever\r\nit is, without minding me: and you\xe2\x80\x99ll smoke your pipe, too, if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nso disposed, Sir, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toodle. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my bit of backer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good of you to say so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cand I really do\r\nassure you now, unfeignedly, that it will be a great comfort to me, and\r\nthat whatever good I may be fortunate enough to do the children, you\r\nwill more than pay back to me, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll enter into this little bargain\r\ncomfortably, and easily, and good-naturedly, without another word about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bargain was ratified on the spot; and Miss Tox found herself so\r\nmuch at home already, that without delay she instituted a preliminary\r\nexamination of the children all round\xe2\x80\x94which Mr Toodle much admired\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nbooked their ages, names, and acquirements, on a piece of paper. This\r\nceremony, and a little attendant gossip, prolonged the time until after\r\ntheir usual hour of going to bed, and detained Miss Tox at the Toodle\r\nfireside until it was too late for her to walk home alone. The gallant\r\nGrinder, however, being still there, politely offered to attend her to\r\nher own door; and as it was something to Miss Tox to be seen home by a\r\nyouth whom Mr Dombey had first inducted into those manly garments which\r\nare rarely mentioned by name, she very readily accepted the proposal.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands with Mr Toodle and Polly, and kissing all the\r\nchildren, Miss Tox left the house, therefore, with unlimited\r\npopularity, and carrying away with her so light a heart that it might\r\nhave given Mrs Chick offence if that good lady could have weighed it.\r\n\r\nRob the Grinder, in his modesty, would have walked behind, but Miss Tox\r\ndesired him to keep beside her, for conversational purposes; and, as\r\nshe afterwards expressed it to his mother, \xe2\x80\x9cdrew him out,\xe2\x80\x9d upon the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHe drew out so bright, and clear, and shining, that Miss Tox was\r\ncharmed with him. The more Miss Tox drew him out, the finer he\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94like wire. There never was a better or more promising youth\xe2\x80\x94a more\r\naffectionate, steady, prudent, sober, honest, meek, candid young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94than Rob drew out, that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, arrived at her own door, \xe2\x80\x9cto know\r\nyou. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider me your friend, and that you\xe2\x80\x99ll come and\r\nsee me as often as you like. Do you keep a money-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m saving up, against I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough to\r\nput in the Bank, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery laudable indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it. Put this\r\nhalf-crown into it, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh thank you, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cbut really I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\ndepriving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI commend your independent spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndeprivation, I assure you. I shall be offended if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it, as\r\na mark of my good-will. Good-night, Robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cand thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho ran sniggering off to get change, and tossed it away with a pieman.\r\nBut they never taught honour at the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 School, where the system\r\nthat prevailed was particularly strong in the engendering of hypocrisy.\r\nInsomuch, that many of the friends and masters of past Grinders said,\r\nif this were what came of education for the common people, let us have\r\nnone. Some more rational said, let us have a better one. But the\r\ngoverning powers of the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 Company were always ready for them,\r\nby picking out a few boys who had turned out well in spite of the\r\nsystem, and roundly asserting that they could have only turned out well\r\nbecause of it. Which settled the business of those objectors out of\r\nhand, and established the glory of the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nFurther Adventures of Captain Edward Cuttle, Mariner\r\n\r\n\r\nTime, sure of foot and strong of will, had so pressed onward, that the\r\nyear enjoined by the old Instrument-maker, as the term during which his\r\nfriend should refrain from opening the sealed packet accompanying the\r\nletter he had left for him, was now nearly expired, and Captain Cuttle\r\nbegan to look at it, of an evening, with feelings of mystery and\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, in his honour, would as soon have thought of opening the\r\nparcel one hour before the expiration of the term, as he would have\r\nthought of opening himself, to study his own anatomy. He merely brought\r\nit out, at a certain stage of his first evening pipe, laid it on the\r\ntable, and sat gazing at the outside of it, through the smoke, in\r\nsilent gravity, for two or three hours at a spell. Sometimes, when he\r\nhad contemplated it thus for a pretty long while, the Captain would\r\nhitch his chair, by degrees, farther and farther off, as if to get\r\nbeyond the range of its fascination; but if this were his design, he\r\nnever succeeded: for even when he was brought up by the parlour wall,\r\nthe packet still attracted him; or if his eyes, in thoughtful\r\nwandering, roved to the ceiling or the fire, its image immediately\r\nfollowed, and posted itself conspicuously among the coals, or took up\r\nan advantageous position on the whitewash.\r\n\r\nIn respect of Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight, the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s parental and admiration\r\nknew no change. But since his last interview with Mr Carker, Captain\r\nCuttle had come to entertain doubts whether his former intervention in\r\nbehalf of that young lady and his dear boy Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, had proved altogether\r\nso favourable as he could have wished, and as he at the time believed.\r\nThe Captain was troubled with a serious misgiving that he had done more\r\nharm than good, in short; and in his remorse and modesty he made the\r\nbest atonement he could think of, by putting himself out of the way of\r\ndoing any harm to anyone, and, as it were, throwing himself overboard\r\nfor a dangerous person.\r\n\r\nSelf-buried, therefore, among the instruments, the Captain never went\r\nnear Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, or reported himself in any way to Florence or\r\nMiss Nipper. He even severed himself from Mr Perch, on the occasion of\r\nhis next visit, by dryly informing that gentleman, that he thanked him\r\nfor his company, but had cut himself adrift from all such acquaintance,\r\nas he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what magazine he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t blow up, without meaning of\r\nit. In this self-imposed retirement, the Captain passed whole days and\r\nweeks without interchanging a word with anyone but Rob the Grinder,\r\nwhom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity.\r\nIn this retirement, the Captain, gazing at the packet of an evening,\r\nwould sit smoking, and thinking of Florence and poor Walter, until they\r\nboth seemed to his homely fancy to be dead, and to have passed away\r\ninto eternal youth, the beautiful and innocent children of his first\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nThe Captain did not, however, in his musings, neglect his own\r\nimprovement, or the mental culture of Rob the Grinder. That young man\r\nwas generally required to read out of some book to the Captain, for one\r\nhour, every evening; and as the Captain implicitly believed that all\r\nbooks were true, he accumulated, by this means, many remarkable facts.\r\nOn Sunday nights, the Captain always read for himself, before going to\r\nbed, a certain Divine Sermon once delivered on a Mount; and although he\r\nwas accustomed to quote the text, without book, after his own manner,\r\nhe appeared to read it with as reverent an understanding of its\r\nheavenly spirit, as if he had got it all by heart in Greek, and had\r\nbeen able to write any number of fierce theological disquisitions on\r\nits every phrase.\r\n\r\nRob the Grinder, whose reverence for the inspired writings, under the\r\nadmirable system of the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 School, had been developed by a\r\nperpetual bruising of his intellectual shins against all the proper\r\nnames of all the tribes of Judah, and by the monotonous repetition of\r\nhard verses, especially by way of punishment, and by the parading of\r\nhim at six years old in leather breeches, three times a Sunday, very\r\nhigh up, in a very hot church, with a great organ buzzing against his\r\ndrowsy head, like an exceedingly busy bee\xe2\x80\x94Rob the Grinder made a mighty\r\nshow of being edified when the Captain ceased to read, and generally\r\nyawned and nodded while the reading was in progress. The latter fact\r\nbeing never so much as suspected by the good Captain.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, also, as a man of business; took to keeping books. In\r\nthese he entered observations on the weather, and on the currents of\r\nthe waggons and other vehicles: which he observed, in that quarter, to\r\nset westward in the morning and during the greater part of the day, and\r\neastward towards the evening. Two or three stragglers appearing in one\r\nweek, who \xe2\x80\x9cspoke him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so the Captain entered it\xe2\x80\x94on the subject of\r\nspectacles, and who, without positively purchasing, said they would\r\nlook in again, the Captain decided that the business was improving, and\r\nmade an entry in the day-book to that effect: the wind then blowing\r\n(which he first recorded) pretty fresh, west and by north; having\r\nchanged in the night.\r\n\r\nOne of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s chief difficulties was Mr Toots, who called\r\nfrequently, and who without saying much seemed to have an idea that the\r\nlittle back parlour was an eligible room to chuckle in, as he would sit\r\nand avail himself of its accommodations in that regard by the half-hour\r\ntogether, without at all advancing in intimacy with the Captain. The\r\nCaptain, rendered cautious by his late experience, was unable quite to\r\nsatisfy his mind whether Mr Toots was the mild subject he appeared to\r\nbe, or was a profoundly artful and dissimulating hypocrite. His\r\nfrequent reference to Miss Dombey was suspicious; but the Captain had a\r\nsecret kindness for Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s apparent reliance on him, and forbore to\r\ndecide against him for the present; merely eyeing him, with a sagacity\r\nnot to be described, whenever he approached the subject that was\r\nnearest to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d blurted out Mr Toots, one day all at once, as his\r\nmanner was, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think you could think favourably of that\r\nproposition of mine, and give me the pleasure of your acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I tell you what it is, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, who had at\r\nlength concluded on a course of action; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been turning that there,\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills, it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much\r\nobliged to you. Upon my word and honour, Captain Gills, it would be a\r\ncharity to give me the pleasure of your acquaintance. It really would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d argued the Captain slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you never can know me, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, steadfast\r\nto his point, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me the pleasure of your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain seemed struck by the originality and power of this remark,\r\nand looked at Mr Toots as if he thought there was a great deal more in\r\nhim than he had expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Captain, nodding his head\r\nthoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cand true. Now look\xe2\x80\x99ee here: You\xe2\x80\x99ve made some\r\nobservations to me, which gives me to understand as you admire a\r\ncertain sweet creetur. Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, gesticulating violently with the hand\r\nin which he held his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiration is not the word. Upon my honour,\r\nyou have no conception what my feelings are. If I could be dyed black,\r\nand made Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s slave, I should consider it a compliment. If, at\r\nthe sacrifice of all my property, I could get transmigrated into Miss\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s dog\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I really think I should never leave off wagging my tail.\r\nI should be so perfectly happy, Captain Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots said it with watery eyes, and pressed his hat against his\r\nbosom with deep emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, moved to compassion, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\narnest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in such a state of mind, and am\r\nso dreadfully in earnest, that if I could swear to it upon a hot piece\r\nof iron, or a live coal, or melted lead, or burning sealing-wax, Or\r\nanything of that sort, I should be glad to hurt myself, as a relief to\r\nmy feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr Toots looked hurriedly about the room, as if for\r\nsome sufficiently painful means of accomplishing his dread purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Captain pushed his glazed hat back upon his head, stroked his face\r\ndown with his heavy hand\xe2\x80\x94making his nose more mottled in the\r\nprocess\xe2\x80\x94and planting himself before Mr Toots, and hooking him by the\r\nlapel of his coat, addressed him in these words, while Mr Toots looked\r\nup into his face, with much attention and some wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in arnest, you see, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nobject of clemency, and clemency is the brightest jewel in the crown of\r\na Briton\xe2\x80\x99s head, for which you\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul the constitution as laid\r\ndown in Rule Britannia, and, when found, that is the charter as them\r\ngarden angels was a singing of, so many times over. Stand by! This here\r\nproposal o\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99rn takes me a little aback. And why? Because I holds my\r\nown only, you understand, in these here waters, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t got no\r\nconsort, and may be don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for none. Steady! You hailed me first,\r\nalong of a certain young lady, as you was chartered by. Now if you and\r\nme is to keep one another\xe2\x80\x99s company at all, that there young creetur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname must never be named nor referred to. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what harm mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been done by naming of it too free, afore now, and thereby I\r\nbrings up short. D\xe2\x80\x99ye make me out pretty clear, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite follow you sometimes. But upon my word I\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard thing,\r\nCaptain Gills, not to be able to mention Miss Dombey. I really have got\r\nsuch a dreadful load here!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr Toots pathetically touched his\r\nshirt-front with both hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat I feel night and day, exactly as if\r\nsomebody was sitting upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cis the terms I offer. If they\xe2\x80\x99re hard upon\r\nyou, brother, as mayhap they are, give \xe2\x80\x99em a wide berth, sheer off, and\r\npart company cheerily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how it is, but after\r\nwhat you told me when I came here, for the first time, I\xe2\x80\x94I feel that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather think about Miss Dombey in your society than talk about her\r\nin almost anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. Therefore, Captain Gills, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me\r\nthe pleasure of your acquaintance, I shall be very happy to accept it\r\non your own conditions. I wish to be honourable, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Toots, holding back his extended hand for a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore I\r\nam obliged to say that I can not help thinking about Miss Dombey. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible for me to make a promise not to think about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, whose opinion of Mr Toots was much improved\r\nby this candid avowal, \xe2\x80\x9ca man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts is like the winds, and nobody\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t answer for \xe2\x80\x99em for certain, any length of time together. Is it a\r\ntreaty as to words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to words, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can bind\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots gave Captain Cuttle his hand upon it, then and there; and the\r\nCaptain with a pleasant and gracious show of condescension, bestowed\r\nhis acquaintance upon him formally. Mr Toots seemed much relieved and\r\ngladdened by the acquisition, and chuckled rapturously during the\r\nremainder of his visit. The Captain, for his part, was not ill pleased\r\nto occupy that position of patronage, and was exceedingly well\r\nsatisfied by his own prudence and foresight.\r\n\r\nBut rich as Captain Cuttle was in the latter quality, he received a\r\nsurprise that same evening from a no less ingenuous and simple youth,\r\nthan Rob the Grinder. That artless lad, drinking tea at the same table,\r\nand bending meekly over his cup and saucer, having taken sidelong\r\nobservations of his master for some time, who was reading the newspaper\r\nwith great difficulty, but much dignity, through his glasses, broke\r\nsilence by saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg your pardon, Captain, but you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be in want of any\r\npigeons, may you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was wishing to dispose of mine, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99m going, Captain, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain, looking round at him\r\nover the glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I was going to leave you, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nRob, with a sneaking smile.\r\n\r\nThe Captain put down the paper, took off his spectacles, and brought\r\nhis eyes to bear on the deserter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Captain, I am going to give you warning. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nknown that beforehand, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, rubbing his hands, and\r\ngetting up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could be so good as provide yourself soon, Captain,\r\nit would be a great convenience to me. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide yourself by\r\nto-morrow morning, I am afraid, Captain: could you, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re a going to desert your colours, are you, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, after a long examination of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard upon a cove, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the tender Rob,\r\ninjured and indignant in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he can\xe2\x80\x99t give lawful warning,\r\nwithout being frowned at in that way, and called a deserter. You\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any right to call a poor cove names, Captain. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a servant and you\xe2\x80\x99re a master, that you\xe2\x80\x99re to go and libel me. What\r\nwrong have I done? Come, Captain, let me know what my crime is, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stricken Grinder wept, and put his coat-cuff in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the injured youth, \xe2\x80\x9cgive my crime a name! What\r\nhave I been and done? Have I stolen any of the property? have I set the\r\nhouse a-fire? If I have, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give me in charge, and try it?\r\nBut to take away the character of a lad that\xe2\x80\x99s been a good servant to\r\nyou, because he can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to stand in his own light for your good,\r\nwhat a injury it is, and what a bad return for faithful service! This\r\nis the way young coves is spiled and drove wrong. I wonder at you,\r\nCaptain, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of which the Grinder howled forth in a lachrymose whine, and\r\nbacking carefully towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got another berth, have you, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\neyeing him intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain, since you put it in that shape, I have got another\r\nberth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, backing more and more; \xe2\x80\x9ca better berth than I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nhere, and one where I don\xe2\x80\x99t so much as want your good word, Captain,\r\nwhich is fort\xe2\x80\x99nate for me, after all the dirt you\xe2\x80\x99ve throw\xe2\x80\x99d at me,\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m poor, and can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to stand in my own light for your\r\ngood. Yes, I have got another berth; and if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for leaving you\r\nunprovided, Captain, I\xe2\x80\x99d go to it now, sooner than I\xe2\x80\x99d take them names\r\nfrom you, because I\xe2\x80\x99m poor, and can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to stand in my own light\r\nfor your good. Why do you reproach me for being poor, and not standing\r\nin my own light for your good, Captain? How can you so demean\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook ye here, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the peaceful Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you pay\r\nout no more of them words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, don\xe2\x80\x99t you pay in no more of your words, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nthe roused innocent, getting louder in his whine, and backing into the\r\nshop. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner you took my blood than my character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Captain calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heerd, may be, of such\r\na thing as a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, have I though, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the taunting Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cNo I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t. I never heerd of any such a article!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my belief as you\xe2\x80\x99ll know more about it\r\npretty soon, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t keep a bright look-out. I can read your\r\nsignals, my lad. You may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I may go at once, may I, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, exulting in his\r\nsuccess. \xe2\x80\x9cBut mind! I never asked to go at once, Captain. You are not\r\nto take away my character again, because you send me off of your own\r\naccord. And you\xe2\x80\x99re not to stop any of my wages, Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis employer settled the last point by producing the tin canister and\r\ntelling the Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s money out in full upon the table. Rob, snivelling\r\nand sobbing, and grievously wounded in his feelings, took up the pieces\r\none by one, with a sob and a snivel for each, and tied them up\r\nseparately in knots in his pockethandkerchief; then he ascended to the\r\nroof of the house and filled his hat and pockets with pigeons; then,\r\ncame down to his bed under the counter and made up his bundle,\r\nsnivelling and sobbing louder, as if he were cut to the heart by old\r\nassociations; then he whined, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Captain. I leave you without\r\nmalice!\xe2\x80\x9d and then, going out upon the door-step, pulled the little\r\nMidshipman\xe2\x80\x99s nose as a parting indignity, and went away down the street\r\ngrinning triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, left to himself, resumed his perusal of the news as if\r\nnothing unusual or unexpected had taken place, and went reading on with\r\nthe greatest assiduity. But never a word did Captain Cuttle understand,\r\nthough he read a vast number, for Rob the Grinder was scampering up one\r\ncolumn and down another all through the newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the worthy Captain had ever felt himself quite\r\nabandoned until now; but now, old Sol Gills, Walter, and Heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDelight were lost to him indeed, and now Mr Carker deceived and jeered\r\nhim cruelly. They were all represented in the false Rob, to whom he had\r\nheld forth many a time on the recollections that were warm within him;\r\nhe had believed in the false Rob, and had been glad to believe in him;\r\nhe had made a companion of him as the last of the old ship\xe2\x80\x99s company;\r\nhe had taken the command of the little Midshipman with him at his right\r\nhand; he had meant to do his duty by him, and had felt almost as kindly\r\ntowards the boy as if they had been shipwrecked and cast upon a desert\r\nplace together. And now, that the false Rob had brought distrust,\r\ntreachery, and meanness into the very parlour, which was a kind of\r\nsacred place, Captain Cuttle felt as if the parlour might have gone\r\ndown next, and not surprised him much by its sinking, or given him any\r\nvery great concern.\r\n\r\nTherefore Captain Cuttle read the newspaper with profound attention and\r\nno comprehension, and therefore Captain Cuttle said nothing whatever\r\nabout Rob to himself, or admitted to himself that he was thinking about\r\nhim, or would recognise in the most distant manner that Rob had\r\nanything to do with his feeling as lonely as Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nIn the same composed, business-like way, the Captain stepped over to\r\nLeadenhall Market in the dusk, and effected an arrangement with a\r\nprivate watchman on duty there, to come and put up and take down the\r\nshutters of the wooden Midshipman every night and morning. He then\r\ncalled in at the eating-house to diminish by one half the daily rations\r\ntheretofore supplied to the Midshipman, and at the public-house to stop\r\nthe traitor\xe2\x80\x99s beer. \xe2\x80\x9cMy young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, in explanation to\r\nthe young lady at the bar, \xe2\x80\x9cmy young man having bettered himself,\r\nMiss.\xe2\x80\x9d Lastly, the Captain resolved to take possession of the bed under\r\nthe counter, and to turn in there o\xe2\x80\x99 nights instead of upstairs, as\r\nsole guardian of the property.\r\n\r\nFrom this bed Captain Cuttle daily rose thenceforth, and clapped on his\r\nglazed hat at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, with the solitary air of\r\nCrusoe finishing his toilet with his goat-skin cap; and although his\r\nfears of a visitation from the savage tribe, MacStinger, were somewhat\r\ncooled, as similar apprehensions on the part of that lone mariner used\r\nto be by the lapse of a long interval without any symptoms of the\r\ncannibals, he still observed a regular routine of defensive operations,\r\nand never encountered a bonnet without previous survey from his castle\r\nof retreat. In the meantime (during which he received no call from Mr\r\nToots, who wrote to say he was out of town) his own voice began to have\r\na strange sound in his ears; and he acquired such habits of profound\r\nmeditation from much polishing and stowing away of the stock, and from\r\nmuch sitting behind the counter reading, or looking out of window, that\r\nthe red rim made on his forehead by the hard glazed hat, sometimes\r\nached again with excess of reflection.\r\n\r\nThe year being now expired, Captain Cuttle deemed it expedient to open\r\nthe packet; but as he had always designed doing this in the presence of\r\nRob the Grinder, who had brought it to him, and as he had an idea that\r\nit would be regular and ship-shape to open it in the presence of\r\nsomebody, he was sadly put to it for want of a witness. In this\r\ndifficulty, he hailed one day with unusual delight the announcement in\r\nthe Shipping Intelligence of the arrival of the Cautious Clara, Captain\r\nJohn Bunsby, from a coasting voyage; and to that philosopher\r\nimmediately dispatched a letter by post, enjoining inviolable secrecy\r\nas to his place of residence, and requesting to be favoured with an\r\nearly visit, in the evening season.\r\n\r\nBunsby, who was one of those sages who act upon conviction, took some\r\ndays to get the conviction thoroughly into his mind, that he had\r\nreceived a letter to this effect. But when he had grappled with the\r\nfact, and mastered it, he promptly sent his boy with the message, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na coming tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Who being instructed to deliver those words and\r\ndisappear, fulfilled his mission like a tarry spirit, charged with a\r\nmysterious warning.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, well pleased to receive it, made preparation of pipes and\r\nrum and water, and awaited his visitor in the back parlour. At the hour\r\nof eight, a deep lowing, as of a nautical Bull, outside the shop-door,\r\nsucceeded by the knocking of a stick on the panel, announced to the\r\nlistening ear of Captain Cuttle, that Bunsby was alongside; whom he\r\ninstantly admitted, shaggy and loose, and with his stolid mahogany\r\nvisage, as usual, appearing to have no consciousness of anything before\r\nit, but to be attentively observing something that was taking place in\r\nquite another part of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, grasping him by the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat cheer, my\r\nlad, what cheer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShipmet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice within Bunsby, unaccompanied by any sign\r\non the part of the Commander himself, \xe2\x80\x9chearty, hearty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, rendering irrepressible homage to his\r\ngenius, \xe2\x80\x9chere you are! a man as can give an opinion as is brighter than\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99monds\xe2\x80\x94and give me the lad with the tarry trousers as shines to me\r\nlike di\xe2\x80\x99monds bright, for which you\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul the Stanfell\xe2\x80\x99s Budget,\r\nand when found make a note. Here you are, a man as gave an opinion in\r\nthis here very place, that has come true, every letter on it,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nthe Captain sincerely believed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Bunsby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor why?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Bunsby, looking at his friend for the first time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way? If so, why not? Therefore.\xe2\x80\x9d With these oracular words\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nseemed almost to make the Captain giddy; they launched him upon such a\r\nsea of speculation and conjecture\xe2\x80\x94the sage submitted to be helped off\r\nwith his pilot-coat, and accompanied his friend into the back parlour,\r\nwhere his hand presently alighted on the rum-bottle, from which he\r\nbrewed a stiff glass of grog; and presently afterwards on a pipe, which\r\nhe filled, lighted, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, imitating his visitor in the matter of these\r\nparticulars, though the rapt and imperturbable manner of the great\r\nCommander was far above his powers, sat in the opposite corner of the\r\nfireside, observing him respectfully, and as if he waited for some\r\nencouragement or expression of curiosity on Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s part which should\r\nlead him to his own affairs. But as the mahogany philosopher gave no\r\nevidence of being sentient of anything but warmth and tobacco, except\r\nonce, when taking his pipe from his lips to make room for his glass, he\r\nincidentally remarked with exceeding gruffness, that his name was Jack\r\nBunsby\xe2\x80\x94a declaration that presented but small opening for\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94the Captain bespeaking his attention in a short\r\ncomplimentary exordium, narrated the whole history of Uncle Sol\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, with the change it had produced in his own life and\r\nfortunes; and concluded by placing the packet on the table.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, Mr Bunsby nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\nBunsby nodded again.\r\n\r\nThe Captain accordingly broke the seal, and disclosed to view two\r\nfolded papers, of which he severally read the endorsements, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cLast\r\nWill and Testament of Solomon Gills.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLetter for Ned Cuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunsby, with his eye on the coast of Greenland, seemed to listen for\r\nthe contents. The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat, and\r\nread the letter aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear Ned Cuttle. When I left home for the West Indies\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Captain stopped, and looked hard at Bunsby, who looked fixedly\r\nat the coast of Greenland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear boy, I knew that if you\r\nwere acquainted with my design, you would thwart it, or accompany me;\r\nand therefore I kept it secret. If you ever read this letter, Ned, I am\r\nlikely to be dead. You will easily forgive an old friend\xe2\x80\x99s folly then,\r\nand will feel for the restlessness and uncertainty in which he wandered\r\naway on such a wild voyage. So no more of that. I have little hope that\r\nmy poor boy will ever read these words, or gladden your eyes with the\r\nsight of his frank face any more.\xe2\x80\x99 No, no; no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain\r\nCuttle, sorrowfully meditating; \xe2\x80\x9cno more. There he lays, all his days\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Bunsby, who had a musical ear, suddenly bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Bays of\r\nBiscay, O!\xe2\x80\x9d which so affected the good Captain, as an appropriate\r\ntribute to departed worth, that he shook him by the hand in\r\nacknowledgment, and was fain to wipe his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain with a sigh, as the Lament of Bunsby\r\nceased to ring and vibrate in the skylight. \xe2\x80\x9cAffliction sore, long time\r\nhe bore, and let us overhaul the wollume, and there find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhysicians,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Bunsby, \xe2\x80\x9cwas in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good o\xe2\x80\x99 them in two\r\nor three hundred fathoms o\xe2\x80\x99 water!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, returning to the letter, he\r\nread on:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c"But if he should be by, when it is opened;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain\r\ninvoluntarily looked round, and shook his head; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98or should know of it\r\nat any other time;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain shook his head again; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98my blessing on\r\nhim! In case the accompanying paper is not legally written, it matters\r\nvery little, for there is no one interested but you and he, and my\r\nplain wish is, that if he is living he should have what little there\r\nmay be, and if (as I fear) otherwise, that you should have it, Ned. You\r\nwill respect my wish, I know. God bless you for it, and for all your\r\nfriendliness besides, to Solomon Gills.\xe2\x80\x99 Bunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nappealing to him solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you make of this? There you sit, a\r\nman as has had his head broke from infancy up\xe2\x80\x99ards, and has got a new\r\nopinion into it at every seam as has been opened. Now, what do you make\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so be,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Bunsby, with unusual promptitude, \xe2\x80\x9cas he\xe2\x80\x99s dead,\r\nmy opinion is he won\xe2\x80\x99t come back no more. If so be as he\xe2\x80\x99s alive, my\r\nopinion is he will. Do I say he will? No. Why not? Because the bearings\r\nof this obserwation lays in the application on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, who would seem to have estimated the\r\nvalue of his distinguished friend\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in proportion to the\r\nimmensity of the difficulty he experienced in making anything out of\r\nthem; \xe2\x80\x9cBunsby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, quite confounded by admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncarry a weight of mind easy, as would swamp one of my tonnage soon. But\r\nin regard o\xe2\x80\x99 this here will, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to take no steps towards the\r\nproperty\xe2\x80\x94Lord forbid!\xe2\x80\x94except to keep it for a more rightful owner; and\r\nI hope yet as the rightful owner, Sol Gills, is living and\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nback, strange as it is that he ain\xe2\x80\x99t forwarded no dispatches. Now, what\r\nis your opinion, Bunsby, as to stowing of these here papers away again,\r\nand marking outside as they was opened, such a day, in the presence of\r\nJohn Bunsby and Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunsby, descrying no objection, on the coast of Greenland or elsewhere,\r\nto this proposal, it was carried into execution; and that great man,\r\nbringing his eye into the present for a moment, affixed his sign-manual\r\nto the cover, totally abstaining, with characteristic modesty, from the\r\nuse of capital letters. Captain Cuttle, having attached his own\r\nleft-handed signature, and locked up the packet in the iron safe,\r\nentreated his guest to mix another glass and smoke another pipe; and\r\ndoing the like himself, fell a musing over the fire on the possible\r\nfortunes of the poor old Instrument-maker.\r\n\r\nAnd now a surprise occurred, so overwhelming and terrific that Captain\r\nCuttle, unsupported by the presence of Bunsby, must have sunk beneath\r\nit, and been a lost man from that fatal hour.\r\n\r\nHow the Captain, even in the satisfaction of admitting such a guest,\r\ncould have only shut the door, and not locked it, of which negligence\r\nhe was undoubtedly guilty, is one of those questions that must for ever\r\nremain mere points of speculation, or vague charges against destiny.\r\nBut by that unlocked door, at this quiet moment, did the fell\r\nMacStinger dash into the parlour, bringing Alexander MacStinger in her\r\nparental arms, and confusion and vengeance (not to mention Juliana\r\nMacStinger, and the sweet child\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Charles MacStinger,\r\npopularly known about the scenes of his youthful sports, as Chowley) in\r\nher train. She came so swiftly and so silently, like a rushing air from\r\nthe neighbourhood of the East India Docks, that Captain Cuttle found\r\nhimself in the very act of sitting looking at her, before the calm face\r\nwith which he had been meditating, changed to one of horror and dismay.\r\n\r\nBut the moment Captain Cuttle understood the full extent of his\r\nmisfortune, self-preservation dictated an attempt at flight. Darting at\r\nthe little door which opened from the parlour on the steep little range\r\nof cellar-steps, the Captain made a rush, head-foremost, at the latter,\r\nlike a man indifferent to bruises and contusions, who only sought to\r\nhide himself in the bowels of the earth. In this gallant effort he\r\nwould probably have succeeded, but for the affectionate dispositions of\r\nJuliana and Chowley, who pinning him by the legs\xe2\x80\x94one of those dear\r\nchildren holding on to each\xe2\x80\x94claimed him as their friend, with\r\nlamentable cries. In the meantime, Mrs MacStinger, who never entered\r\nupon any action of importance without previously inverting Alexander\r\nMacStinger, to bring him within the range of a brisk battery of slaps,\r\nand then sitting him down to cool as the reader first beheld him,\r\nperformed that solemn rite, as if on this occasion it were a sacrifice\r\nto the Furies; and having deposited the victim on the floor, made at\r\nthe Captain with a strength of purpose that appeared to threaten\r\nscratches to the interposing Bunsby.\r\n\r\nThe cries of the two elder MacStingers, and the wailing of young\r\nAlexander, who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood,\r\nforasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy\r\nperiod of existence, combined to make this visitation the more awful.\r\nBut when silence reigned again, and the Captain, in a violent\r\nperspiration, stood meekly looking at Mrs MacStinger, its terrors were\r\nat their height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, making her\r\nchin rigid, and shaking it in unison with what, but for the weakness of\r\nher sex, might be described as her fist. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nCuttle, do you dare to look me in the face, and not be struck down in\r\nthe berth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who looked anything but daring, feebly muttered \xe2\x80\x9cStand\r\nby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I was a weak and trusting Fool when I took you under my roof,\r\nCap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle, I was!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs MacStinger. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think of the benefits\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve showered on that man, and the way in which I brought my children\r\nup to love and honour him as if he was a father to \xe2\x80\x99em, when there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a housekeeper, no nor a lodger in our street, don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\r\nlost money by that man, and by his guzzlings and his muzzlings\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs\r\nMacStinger used the last word for the joint sake of alliteration and\r\naggravation, rather than for the expression of any idea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand when they\r\ncried out one and all, shame upon him for putting upon an industrious\r\nwoman, up early and late for the good of her young family, and keeping\r\nher poor place so clean that a individual might have ate his dinner,\r\nyes, and his tea too, if he was so disposed, off any one of the floors\r\nor stairs, in spite of all his guzzlings and his muzzlings, such was\r\nthe care and pains bestowed upon him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs MacStinger stopped to fetch her breath; and her face flushed with\r\ntriumph in this second happy introduction of Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuzzlings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he runs awa-a-a-y!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs MacStinger, with a lengthening out\r\nof the last syllable that made the unfortunate Captain regard himself\r\nas the meanest of men; \xe2\x80\x9cand keeps away a twelve-month! From a woman!\r\nSuch is his conscience! He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage to meet her hi-i-igh;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlong syllable again; \xe2\x80\x9cbut steals away, like a fellon. Why, if that baby\r\nof mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, with sudden rapidity, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to offer to\r\ngo and steal away, I\xe2\x80\x99d do my duty as a mother by him, till he was\r\ncovered with wales!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe young Alexander, interpreting this into a positive promise, to be\r\nshortly redeemed, tumbled over with fear and grief, and lay upon the\r\nfloor, exhibiting the soles of his shoes and making such a deafening\r\noutcry, that Mrs MacStinger found it necessary to take him up in her\r\narms, where she quieted him, ever and anon, as he broke out again, by a\r\nshake that seemed enough to loosen his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty sort of a man is Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, with a\r\nsharp stress on the first syllable of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s name, \xe2\x80\x9cto take on\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94and to lose sleep for\xe2\x80\x94and to faint along of\xe2\x80\x94and to think dead\r\nforsooth\xe2\x80\x94and to go up and down the blessed town like a madwoman, asking\r\nquestions after! Oh, a pretty sort of a man! Ha ha ha ha! He\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nall that trouble and distress of mind, and much more. That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\r\nbless you! Ha ha ha ha! Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, with\r\nsevere reaction in her voice and manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na-coming home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe frightened Captain looked into his hat, as if he saw nothing for it\r\nbut to put it on, and give himself up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs MacStinger, in the same determined\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know if you\xe2\x80\x99re a-coming home, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain seemed quite ready to go, but faintly suggested something\r\nto the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cnot making so much noise about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunsby, in a soothing tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAwast, my lass, awast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who may you be, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs MacStinger, with\r\nchaste loftiness. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever lodge at Number Nine, Brig Place, Sir?\r\nMy memory may be bad, but not with me, I think. There was a Mrs Jollson\r\nlived at Number Nine before me, and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaking me for\r\nher. That is my only ways of accounting for your familiarity, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my lass, awast, awast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunsby.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle could hardly believe it, even of this great man, though\r\nhe saw it done with his waking eyes; but Bunsby, advancing boldly, put\r\nhis shaggy blue arm round Mrs MacStinger, and so softened her by his\r\nmagic way of doing it, and by these few words\xe2\x80\x94he said no more\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nmelted into tears, after looking upon him for a few moments, and\r\nobserved that a child might conquer her now, she was so low in her\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nSpeechless and utterly amazed, the Captain saw him gradually persuade\r\nthis inexorable woman into the shop, return for rum and water and a\r\ncandle, take them to her, and pacify her without appearing to utter one\r\nword. Presently he looked in with his pilot-coat on, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCuttle,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to act as convoy home;\xe2\x80\x9d and Captain Cuttle, more to his\r\nconfusion than if he had been put in irons himself, for safe transport\r\nto Brig Place, saw the family pacifically filing off, with Mrs\r\nMacStinger at their head. He had scarcely time to take down his\r\ncanister, and stealthily convey some money into the hands of Juliana\r\nMacStinger, his former favourite, and Chowley, who had the claim upon\r\nhim that he was naturally of a maritime build, before the Midshipman\r\nwas abandoned by them all; and Bunsby whispering that he\xe2\x80\x99d carry on\r\nsmart, and hail Ned Cuttle again before he went aboard, shut the door\r\nupon himself, as the last member of the party.\r\n\r\nSome uneasy ideas that he must be walking in his sleep, or that he had\r\nbeen troubled with phantoms, and not a family of flesh and blood, beset\r\nthe Captain at first, when he went back to the little parlour, and\r\nfound himself alone. Illimitable faith in, and immeasurable admiration\r\nof, the Commander of the Cautious Clara, succeeded, and threw the\r\nCaptain into a wondering trance.\r\n\r\nStill, as time wore on, and Bunsby failed to reappear, the Captain\r\nbegan to entertain uncomfortable doubts of another kind. Whether Bunsby\r\nhad been artfully decoyed to Brig Place, and was there detained in safe\r\ncustody as hostage for his friend; in which case it would become the\r\nCaptain, as a man of honour, to release him, by the sacrifice of his\r\nown liberty. Whether he had been attacked and defeated by Mrs\r\nMacStinger, and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture.\r\nWhether Mrs MacStinger, thinking better of it, in the uncertainty of\r\nher temper, had turned back to board the Midshipman again, and Bunsby,\r\npretending to conduct her by a short cut, was endeavouring to lose the\r\nfamily amid the wilds and savage places of the City. Above all, what it\r\nwould behove him, Captain Cuttle, to do, in case of his hearing no\r\nmore, either of the MacStingers or of Bunsby, which, in these wonderful\r\nand unforeseen conjunctions of events, might possibly happen.\r\n\r\nHe debated all this until he was tired; and still no Bunsby. He made up\r\nhis bed under the counter, all ready for turning in; and still no\r\nBunsby. At length, when the Captain had given him up, for that night at\r\nleast, and had begun to undress, the sound of approaching wheels was\r\nheard, and, stopping at the door, was succeeded by Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s hail.\r\n\r\nThe Captain trembled to think that Mrs MacStinger was not to be got rid\r\nof, and had been brought back in a coach.\r\n\r\nBut no. Bunsby was accompanied by nothing but a large box, which he\r\nhauled into the shop with his own hands, and as soon as he had hauled\r\nin, sat upon. Captain Cuttle knew it for the chest he had left at Mrs\r\nMacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s house, and looking, candle in hand, at Bunsby more\r\nattentively, believed that he was three sheets in the wind, or, in\r\nplain words, drunk. It was difficult, however, to be sure of this; the\r\nCommander having no trace of expression in his face when sober.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Commander, getting off the chest, and opening the\r\nlid, \xe2\x80\x9care these here your traps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle looked in and identified his property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone pretty taut and trim, hey, shipmet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunsby.\r\n\r\nThe grateful and bewildered Captain grasped him by the hand, and was\r\nlaunching into a reply expressive of his astonished feelings, when\r\nBunsby disengaged himself by a jerk of his wrist, and seemed to make an\r\neffort to wink with his revolving eye, the only effect of which\r\nattempt, in his condition, was nearly to over-balance him. He then\r\nabruptly opened the door, and shot away to rejoin the Cautious Clara\r\nwith all speed\xe2\x80\x94supposed to be his invariable custom, whenever he\r\nconsidered he had made a point.\r\n\r\nAs it was not his humour to be often sought, Captain Cuttle decided not\r\nto go or send to him next day, or until he should make his gracious\r\npleasure known in such wise, or failing that, until some little time\r\nshould have lapsed. The Captain, therefore, renewed his solitary life\r\nnext morning, and thought profoundly, many mornings, noons, and nights,\r\nof old Sol Gills, and Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments concerning him, and the hopes\r\nthere were of his return. Much of such thinking strengthened Captain\r\nCuttle\xe2\x80\x99s hopes; and he humoured them and himself by watching for the\r\nInstrument-maker at the door\xe2\x80\x94as he ventured to do now, in his strange\r\nliberty\xe2\x80\x94and setting his chair in its place, and arranging the little\r\nparlour as it used to be, in case he should come home unexpectedly. He\r\nlikewise, in his thoughtfulness, took down a certain little miniature\r\nof Walter as a schoolboy, from its accustomed nail, lest it should\r\nshock the old man on his return. The Captain had his presentiments,\r\ntoo, sometimes, that he would come on such a day; and one particular\r\nSunday, even ordered a double allowance of dinner, he was so sanguine.\r\nBut come, old Solomon did not; and still the neighbours noticed how the\r\nseafaring man in the glazed hat, stood at the shop-door of an evening,\r\nlooking up and down the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nDomestic Relations\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not in the nature of things that a man of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s mood,\r\nopposed to such a spirit as he had raised against himself, should be\r\nsoftened in the imperious asperity of his temper; or that the cold hard\r\narmour of pride in which he lived encased, should be made more flexible\r\nby constant collision with haughty scorn and defiance. It is the curse\r\nof such a nature\xe2\x80\x94it is a main part of the heavy retribution on itself\r\nit bears within itself\xe2\x80\x94that while deference and concession swell its\r\nevil qualities, and are the food it grows upon, resistance and a\r\nquestioning of its exacting claims, foster it too, no less. The evil\r\nthat is in it finds equally its means of growth and propagation in\r\nopposites. It draws support and life from sweets and bitters; bowed\r\ndown before, or unacknowledged, it still enslaves the breast in which\r\nit has its throne; and, worshipped or rejected, is as hard a master as\r\nthe Devil in dark fables.\r\n\r\nTowards his first wife, Mr Dombey, in his cold and lofty arrogance, had\r\nborne himself like the removed Being he almost conceived himself to be.\r\nHe had been \xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x9d with her when she first saw him, and he was \xe2\x80\x9cMr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x9d when she died. He had asserted his greatness during their whole\r\nmarried life, and she had meekly recognised it. He had kept his distant\r\nseat of state on the top of his throne, and she her humble station on\r\nits lowest step; and much good it had done him, so to live in solitary\r\nbondage to his one idea. He had imagined that the proud character of\r\nhis second wife would have been added to his own\xe2\x80\x94would have merged into\r\nit, and exalted his greatness. He had pictured himself haughtier than\r\never, with Edith\xe2\x80\x99s haughtiness subservient to his. He had never\r\nentertained the possibility of its arraying itself against him. And\r\nnow, when he found it rising in his path at every step and turn of his\r\ndaily life, fixing its cold, defiant, and contemptuous face upon him,\r\nthis pride of his, instead of withering, or hanging down its head\r\nbeneath the shock, put forth new shoots, became more concentrated and\r\nintense, more gloomy, sullen, irksome, and unyielding, than it had ever\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\nWho wears such armour, too, bears with him ever another heavy\r\nretribution. It is of proof against conciliation, love, and confidence;\r\nagainst all gentle sympathy from without, all trust, all tenderness,\r\nall soft emotion; but to deep stabs in the self-love, it is as\r\nvulnerable as the bare breast to steel; and such tormenting festers\r\nrankle there, as follow on no other wounds, no, though dealt with the\r\nmailed hand of Pride itself, on weaker pride, disarmed and thrown down.\r\n\r\nSuch wounds were his. He felt them sharply, in the solitude of his old\r\nrooms; whither he now began often to retire again, and pass long\r\nsolitary hours. It seemed his fate to be ever proud and powerful; ever\r\nhumbled and powerless where he would be most strong. Who seemed fated\r\nto work out that doom?\r\n\r\nWho? Who was it who could win his wife as she had won his boy? Who was\r\nit who had shown him that new victory, as he sat in the dark corner?\r\nWho was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not? Who\r\nwas it who, unaided by his love, regard or notice, thrived and grew\r\nbeautiful when those so aided died? Who could it be, but the same child\r\nat whom he had often glanced uneasily in her motherless infancy, with a\r\nkind of dread, lest he might come to hate her; and of whom his\r\nforeboding was fulfilled, for he DID hate her in his heart?\r\n\r\nYes, and he would have it hatred, and he made it hatred, though some\r\nsparkles of the light in which she had appeared before him on the\r\nmemorable night of his return home with his Bride, occasionally hung\r\nabout her still. He knew now that she was beautiful; he did not dispute\r\nthat she was graceful and winning, and that in the bright dawn of her\r\nwomanhood she had come upon him, a surprise. But he turned even this\r\nagainst her. In his sullen and unwholesome brooding, the unhappy man,\r\nwith a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts, and a vague\r\nyearning for what he had all his life repelled, made a distorted\r\npicture of his rights and wrongs, and justified himself with it against\r\nher. The worthier she promised to be of him, the greater claim he was\r\ndisposed to antedate upon her duty and submission. When had she ever\r\nshown him duty and submission? Did she grace his life\xe2\x80\x94or Edith\xe2\x80\x99s? Had\r\nher attractions been manifested first to him\xe2\x80\x94or Edith? Why, he and she\r\nhad never been, from her birth, like father and child! They had always\r\nbeen estranged. She had crossed him every way and everywhere. She was\r\nleagued against him now. Her very beauty softened natures that were\r\nobdurate to him, and insulted him with an unnatural triumph.\r\n\r\nIt may have been that in all this there were mutterings of an awakened\r\nfeeling in his breast, however selfishly aroused by his position of\r\ndisadvantage, in comparison with what she might have made his life. But\r\nhe silenced the distant thunder with the rolling of his sea of pride.\r\nHe would bear nothing but his pride. And in his pride, a heap of\r\ninconsistency, and misery, and self-inflicted torment, he hated her.\r\n\r\nTo the moody, stubborn, sullen demon, that possessed him, his wife\r\nopposed her different pride in its full force. They never could have\r\nled a happy life together; but nothing could have made it more unhappy,\r\nthan the wilful and determined warfare of such elements. His pride was\r\nset upon maintaining his magnificent supremacy, and forcing recognition\r\nof it from her. She would have been racked to death, and turned but her\r\nhaughty glance of calm inflexible disdain upon him, to the last. Such\r\nrecognition from Edith! He little knew through what a storm and\r\nstruggle she had been driven onward to the crowning honour of his hand.\r\nHe little knew how much she thought she had conceded, when she suffered\r\nhim to call her wife.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was resolved to show her that he was supreme. There must be\r\nno will but his. Proud he desired that she should be, but she must be\r\nproud for, not against him. As he sat alone, hardening, he would often\r\nhear her go out and come home, treading the round of London life with\r\nno more heed of his liking or disliking, pleasure or displeasure, than\r\nif he had been her groom. Her cold supreme indifference\xe2\x80\x94his own\r\nunquestioned attribute usurped\xe2\x80\x94stung him more than any other kind of\r\ntreatment could have done; and he determined to bend her to his\r\nmagnificent and stately will.\r\n\r\nHe had been long communing with these thoughts, when one night he\r\nsought her in her own apartment, after he had heard her return home\r\nlate. She was alone, in her brilliant dress, and had but that moment\r\ncome from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room. Her face was melancholy and pensive, when\r\nhe came upon her; but it marked him at the door; for, glancing at the\r\nmirror before it, he saw immediately, as in a picture-frame, the\r\nknitted brow, and darkened beauty that he knew so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, entering, \xe2\x80\x9cI must beg leave to have a few words\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no time like the present, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake\r\nyour position. I am used to choose my own times; not to have them\r\nchosen for me. I think you scarcely understand who and what I am, Mrs\r\nDombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I understand you very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked upon him as she said so, and folding her white arms,\r\nsparkling with gold and gems, upon her swelling breast, turned away her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIf she had been less handsome, and less stately in her cold composure,\r\nshe might not have had the power of impressing him with the sense of\r\ndisadvantage that penetrated through his utmost pride. But she had the\r\npower, and he felt it keenly. He glanced round the room: saw how the\r\nsplendid means of personal adornment, and the luxuries of dress, were\r\nscattered here and there, and disregarded; not in mere caprice and\r\ncarelessness (or so he thought), but in a steadfast haughty disregard\r\nof costly things: and felt it more and more. Chaplets of flowers,\r\nplumes of feathers, jewels, laces, silks and satins; look where he\r\nwould, he saw riches, despised, poured out, and made of no account. The\r\nvery diamonds\xe2\x80\x94a marriage gift\xe2\x80\x94that rose and fell impatiently upon her\r\nbosom, seemed to pant to break the chain that clasped them round her\r\nneck, and roll down on the floor where she might tread upon them.\r\n\r\nHe felt his disadvantage, and he showed it. Solemn and strange among\r\nthis wealth of colour and voluptuous glitter, strange and constrained\r\ntowards its haughty mistress, whose repellent beauty it repeated, and\r\npresented all around him, as in so many fragments of a mirror, he was\r\nconscious of embarrassment and awkwardness. Nothing that ministered to\r\nher disdainful self-possession could fail to gall him. Galled and\r\nirritated with himself, he sat down, and went on, in no improved\r\nhumour:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey, it is very necessary that there should be some\r\nunderstanding arrived at between us. Your conduct does not please me,\r\nMadam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe merely glanced at him again, and again averted her eyes; but she\r\nmight have spoken for an hour, and expressed less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat, Mrs Dombey, does not please me. I have already taken\r\noccasion to request that it may be corrected. I now insist upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou chose a fitting occasion for your first remonstrance, Sir, and you\r\nadopt a fitting manner, and a fitting word for your second. You insist!\r\nTo me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with his most offensive air of state, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nmade you my wife. You bear my name. You are associated with my position\r\nand my reputation. I will not say that the world in general may be\r\ndisposed to think you honoured by that association; but I will say that\r\nI am accustomed to \xe2\x80\x98insist,\xe2\x80\x99 to my connexions and dependents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich may you be pleased to consider me? she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly I may think that my wife should partake\xe2\x80\x94or does partake, and\r\ncannot help herself\xe2\x80\x94of both characters, Mrs Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her eyes upon him steadily, and set her trembling lips. He saw\r\nher bosom throb, and saw her face flush and turn white. All this he\r\ncould know, and did: but he could not know that one word was whispering\r\nin the deep recesses of her heart, to keep her quiet; and that the word\r\nwas Florence.\r\n\r\nBlind idiot, rushing to a precipice! He thought she stood in awe of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too expensive, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are extravagant.\r\nYou waste a great deal of money\xe2\x80\x94or what would be a great deal in the\r\npockets of most gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94in cultivating a kind of society that is\r\nuseless to me, and, indeed, that upon the whole is disagreeable to me.\r\nI have to insist upon a total change in all these respects. I know that\r\nin the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as Fortune has\r\nplaced at your disposal, ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme.\r\nThere has been more than enough of that extreme. I beg that Mrs\r\nGranger\xe2\x80\x99s very different experiences may now come to the instruction of\r\nMrs Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the fixed look, the trembling lips, the throbbing breast, the\r\nface now crimson and now white; and still the deep whisper Florence,\r\nFlorence, speaking to her in the beating of her heart.\r\n\r\nHis insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in\r\nher. Swollen no less by her past scorn of him, and his so recent\r\nfeeling of disadvantage, than by her present submission (as he took it\r\nto be), it became too mighty for his breast, and burst all bounds. Why,\r\nwho could long resist his lofty will and pleasure! He had resolved to\r\nconquer her, and look here!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will further please, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in a tone of\r\nsovereign command, \xe2\x80\x9cto understand distinctly, that I am to be deferred\r\nto and obeyed. That I must have a positive show and confession of\r\ndeference before the world, Madam. I am used to this. I require it as\r\nmy right. In short I will have it. I consider it no unreasonable return\r\nfor the worldly advancement that has befallen you; and I believe nobody\r\nwill be surprised, either at its being required from you, or at your\r\nmaking it.\xe2\x80\x94To Me\xe2\x80\x94To Me!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with emphasis.\r\n\r\nNo word from her. No change in her. Her eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learnt from your mother, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with\r\nmagisterial importance, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat no doubt you know, namely, that Brighton\r\nis recommended for her health. Mr Carker has been so good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe changed suddenly. Her face and bosom glowed as if the red light of\r\nan angry sunset had been flung upon them. Not unobservant of the\r\nchange, and putting his own interpretation upon it, Mr Dombey resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker has been so good as to go down and secure a house there, for\r\na time. On the return of the establishment to London, I shall take such\r\nsteps for its better management as I consider necessary. One of these,\r\nwill be the engagement at Brighton (if it is to be effected), of a very\r\nrespectable reduced person there, a Mrs Pipchin, formerly employed in a\r\nsituation of trust in my family, to act as housekeeper. An\r\nestablishment like this, presided over but nominally, Mrs Dombey,\r\nrequires a competent head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had changed her attitude before he arrived at these words, and now\r\nsat\xe2\x80\x94still looking at him fixedly\xe2\x80\x94turning a bracelet round and round\r\nupon her arm; not winding it about with a light, womanly touch, but\r\npressing and dragging it over the smooth skin, until the white limb\r\nshowed a bar of red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI observed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand this concludes what I deem it\r\nnecessary to say to you at present, Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x94I observed a moment ago,\r\nMadam, that my allusion to Mr Carker was received in a peculiar manner.\r\nOn the occasion of my happening to point out to you, before that\r\nconfidential agent, the objection I had to your mode of receiving my\r\nvisitors, you were pleased to object to his presence. You will have to\r\nget the better of that objection, Madam, and to accustom yourself to it\r\nvery probably on many similar occasions; unless you adopt the remedy\r\nwhich is in your own hands, of giving me no cause of complaint. Mr\r\nCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, who, after the emotion he had just seen, set\r\ngreat store by this means of reducing his proud wife, and who was\r\nperhaps sufficiently willing to exhibit his power to that gentleman in\r\na new and triumphant aspect, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker being in my confidence, Mrs\r\nDombey, may very well be in yours to such an extent. I hope, Mrs\r\nDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, after a few moments, during which, in his\r\nincreasing haughtiness, he had improved on his idea, \xe2\x80\x9cI may not find it\r\nnecessary ever to entrust Mr Carker with any message of objection or\r\nremonstrance to you; but as it would be derogatory to my position and\r\nreputation to be frequently holding trivial disputes with a lady upon\r\nwhom I have conferred the highest distinction that it is in my power to\r\nbestow, I shall not scruple to avail myself of his services if I see\r\noccasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, rising in his moral magnificence, and rising a\r\nstiffer and more impenetrable man than ever, \xe2\x80\x9cshe knows me and my\r\nresolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hand that had so pressed the bracelet was laid heavily upon her\r\nbreast, but she looked at him still, with an unaltered face, and said\r\nin a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait! For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! I must speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy did she not, and what was the inward struggle that rendered her\r\nincapable of doing so, for minutes, while, in the strong constraint she\r\nput upon her face, it was as fixed as any statue\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94looking upon him\r\nwith neither yielding nor unyielding, liking nor hatred, pride not\r\nhumility: nothing but a searching gaze?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever tempt you to seek my hand? Did I ever use any art to win\r\nyou? Was I ever more conciliating to you when you pursued me, than I\r\nhave been since our marriage? Was I ever other to you than I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wholly unnecessary, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cto enter upon such\r\ndiscussions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think I loved you? Did you know I did not? Did you ever care,\r\nMan! for my heart, or propose to yourself to win the worthless thing?\r\nWas there any poor pretence of any in our bargain? Upon your side, or\r\non mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9care all wide of the purpose,\r\nMadam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved between him and the door to prevent his going away, and\r\ndrawing her majestic figure to its height, looked steadily upon him\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou answer each of them. You answer me before I speak, I see. How can\r\nyou help it; you who know the miserable truth as well as I? Now, tell\r\nme. If I loved you to devotion, could I do more than render up my whole\r\nwill and being to you, as you have just demanded? If my heart were pure\r\nand all untried, and you its idol, could you ask more; could you have\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly not, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how different I am. You see me looking on you now, and you\r\ncan read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNot a curl of the proud lip, not a flash of the dark eye, nothing but\r\nthe same intent and searching look, accompanied these words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nmy general history. You have spoken of my mother. Do you think you can\r\ndegrade, or bend or break, me to submission and obedience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey smiled, as he might have smiled at an inquiry whether he\r\nthought he could raise ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anything unusual here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a slight motion of\r\nher hand before her brow, which did not for a moment flinch from its\r\nimmovable and otherwise expressionless gaze, \xe2\x80\x9cas I know there are\r\nunusual feelings here,\xe2\x80\x9d raising the hand she pressed upon her bosom,\r\nand heavily returning it, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider that there is no common meaning in\r\nthe appeal I am going to make you. Yes, for I am going;\xe2\x80\x9d she said it as\r\nin prompt reply to something in his face; \xe2\x80\x9cto appeal to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, with a slightly condescending bend of his chin that rustled\r\nand crackled his stiff cravat, sat down on a sofa that was near him, to\r\nhear the appeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can believe that I am of such a nature now,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he fancied he saw\r\ntears glistening in her eyes, and he thought, complacently, that he had\r\nforced them from her, though none fell on her cheek, and she regarded\r\nhim as steadily as ever,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas would make what I now say almost\r\nincredible to myself, said to any man who had become my husband, but,\r\nabove all, said to you, you may, perhaps, attach the greater weight to\r\nit. In the dark end to which we are tending, and may come, we shall not\r\ninvolve ourselves alone (that might not be much) but others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOthers! He knew at whom that word pointed, and frowned heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak to you for the sake of others. Also your own sake; and for\r\nmine. Since our marriage, you have been arrogant to me; and I have\r\nrepaid you in kind. You have shown to me and everyone around us, every\r\nday and hour, that you think I am graced and distinguished by your\r\nalliance. I do not think so, and have shown that too. It seems you do\r\nnot understand, or (so far as your power can go) intend that each of us\r\nshall take a separate course; and you expect from me instead, a homage\r\nyou will never have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough her face was still the same, there was emphatic confirmation\r\nof this \xe2\x80\x9cNever\xe2\x80\x9d in the very breath she drew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel no tenderness towards you; that you know. You would care\r\nnothing for it, if I did or could. I know as well that you feel none\r\ntowards me. But we are linked together; and in the knot that ties us,\r\nas I have said, others are bound up. We must both die; we are both\r\nconnected with the dead already, each by a little child. Let us\r\nforbear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey took a long respiration, as if he would have said, Oh! was\r\nthis all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning paler as she watched him,\r\nwhile her eyes grew yet more lustrous in their earnestness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat could\r\nbuy these words of me, and the meaning that belongs to them. Once cast\r\naway as idle breath, no wealth or power can bring them back. I mean\r\nthem; I have weighed them; and I will be true to what I undertake. If\r\nyou will promise to forbear on your part, I will promise to forbear on\r\nmine. We are a most unhappy pair, in whom, from different causes, every\r\nsentiment that blesses marriage, or justifies it, is rooted out; but in\r\nthe course of time, some friendship, or some fitness for each other,\r\nmay arise between us. I will try to hope so, if you will make the\r\nendeavour too; and I will look forward to a better and a happier use of\r\nage than I have made of youth or prime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout she had spoken in a low plain voice, that neither rose nor\r\nfell; ceasing, she dropped the hand with which she had enforced herself\r\nto be so passionless and distinct, but not the eyes with which she had\r\nso steadily observed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with his utmost dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot entertain\r\nany proposal of this extraordinary nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him yet, without the least change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, rising as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cconsent to temporise\r\nor treat with you, Mrs Dombey, upon a subject as to which you are in\r\npossession of my opinions and expectations. I have stated my ultimatum,\r\nMadam, and have only to request your very serious attention to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo see the face change to its old expression, deepened in intensity! To\r\nsee the eyes droop as from some mean and odious object! To see the\r\nlighting of the haughty brow! To see scorn, anger, indignation, and\r\nabhorrence starting into sight, and the pale blank earnestness vanish\r\nlike a mist! He could not choose but look, although he looked to his\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing with an imperious hand towards the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur first and last confidence is at an end. Nothing can make us\r\nstranger to each other than we are henceforth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take my rightful course, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cundeterred,\r\nyou may be sure, by any general declamation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her back upon him, and, without reply, sat down before her\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI place my reliance on your improved sense of duty, and more correct\r\nfeeling, and better reflection, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nShe answered not one word. He saw no more expression of any heed of\r\nhim, in the mirror, than if he had been an unseen spider on the wall,\r\nor beetle on the floor, or rather, than if he had been the one or\r\nother, seen and crushed when she last turned from him, and forgotten\r\namong the ignominious and dead vermin of the ground.\r\n\r\nHe looked back, as he went out at the door, upon the well-lighted and\r\nluxurious room, the beautiful and glittering objects everywhere\r\ndisplayed, the shape of Edith in its rich dress seated before her\r\nglass, and the face of Edith as the glass presented it to him; and\r\nbetook himself to his old chamber of cogitation, carrying away with him\r\na vivid picture in his mind of all these things, and a rambling and\r\nunaccountable speculation (such as sometimes comes into a man\xe2\x80\x99s head)\r\nhow they would all look when he saw them next.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Mr Dombey was very taciturn, and very dignified, and very\r\nconfident of carrying out his purpose; and remained so.\r\n\r\nHe did not design accompanying the family to Brighton; but he\r\ngraciously informed Cleopatra at breakfast, on the morning of\r\ndeparture, which arrived a day or two afterwards, that he might be\r\nexpected down, soon. There was no time to be lost in getting Cleopatra\r\nto any place recommended as being salutary; for, indeed, she seemed\r\nupon the wane, and turning of the earth, earthy.\r\n\r\nWithout having undergone any decided second attack of her malady, the\r\nold woman seemed to have crawled backward in her recovery from the\r\nfirst. She was more lean and shrunken, more uncertain in her\r\nimbecility, and made stranger confusions in her mind and memory. Among\r\nother symptoms of this last affliction, she fell into the habit of\r\nconfounding the names of her two sons-in-law, the living and the\r\ndeceased; and in general called Mr Dombey, either \xe2\x80\x9cGrangeby,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDomber,\xe2\x80\x9d or indifferently, both.\r\n\r\nBut she was youthful, very youthful still; and in her youthfulness\r\nappeared at breakfast, before going away, in a new bonnet made express,\r\nand a travelling robe that was embroidered and braided like an old\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s. It was not easy to put her into a fly-away bonnet now, or to\r\nkeep the bonnet in its place on the back of her poor nodding head, when\r\nit was got on. In this instance, it had not only the extraneous effect\r\nof being always on one side, but of being perpetually tapped on the\r\ncrown by Flowers the maid, who attended in the background during\r\nbreakfast to perform that duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dearest Grangeby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must posively prom,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cut some of her words short, and cut out others altogether, \xe2\x80\x9ccome\r\ndown very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said just now, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, loudly and laboriously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I am coming in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, Domber!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Major, who was come to take leave of the ladies, and who was\r\nstaring through his apoplectic eyes at Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s face with the\r\ndisinterested composure of an immortal being, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegad, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask old Joe to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSterious wretch, who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d lisped Cleopatra. But a tap on the bonnet\r\nfrom Flowers seeming to jog her memory, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! You mean\r\nyourself, you naughty creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevilish queer, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Major to Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cBad case.\r\nNever did wrap up enough;\xe2\x80\x9d the Major being buttoned to the chin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nwho should J. B. mean by Joe, but old Joe Bagstock\xe2\x80\x94Joseph\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nslave\xe2\x80\x94Joe, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Here! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the man! Here are the Bagstock bellows,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, striking himself a sounding blow on the chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Edith\xe2\x80\x94Grangeby\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s most trordinry thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra,\r\npettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Major\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBagstock! J. B.!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Major, seeing that she faltered for his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my love, you know I\r\nnever could remember names\xe2\x80\x94what was it? oh!\xe2\x80\x94most trordinry thing that\r\nso many people want to come down to see me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going for long. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming back. Surely they can wait, till I come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra looked all round the table as she said it, and appeared very\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have visitors\xe2\x80\x94really don\xe2\x80\x99t want visitors,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9clittle\r\nrepose\xe2\x80\x94and all that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x94is what I quire. No odious brutes\r\nmust proach me till I\xe2\x80\x99ve shaken off this numbness;\xe2\x80\x9d and in a grisly\r\nresumption of her coquettish ways, she made a dab at the Major with her\r\nfan, but overset Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast cup instead, which was in quite\r\na different direction.\r\n\r\nThen she called for Withers, and charged him to see particularly that\r\nword was left about some trivial alterations in her room, which must be\r\nall made before she came back, and which must be set about immediately,\r\nas there was no saying how soon she might come back; for she had a\r\ngreat many engagements, and all sorts of people to call upon. Withers\r\nreceived these directions with becoming deference, and gave his\r\nguarantee for their execution; but when he withdrew a pace or two\r\nbehind her, it appeared as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help looking strangely at the\r\nMajor, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help looking strangely at Mr Dombey, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp looking strangely at Cleopatra, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help nodding her\r\nbonnet over one eye, and rattling her knife and fork upon her plate in\r\nusing them, as if she were playing castanets.\r\n\r\nEdith alone never lifted her eyes to any face at the table, and never\r\nseemed dismayed by anything her mother said or did. She listened to her\r\ndisjointed talk, or at least, turned her head towards her when\r\naddressed; replied in a few low words when necessary; and sometimes\r\nstopped her when she was rambling, or brought her thoughts back with a\r\nmonosyllable, to the point from which they had strayed. The mother,\r\nhowever unsteady in other things, was constant in this\xe2\x80\x94that she was\r\nalways observant of her. She would look at the beautiful face, in its\r\nmarble stillness and severity, now with a kind of fearful admiration;\r\nnow in a giggling foolish effort to move it to a smile; now with\r\ncapricious tears and jealous shakings of her head, as imagining herself\r\nneglected by it; always with an attraction towards it, that never\r\nfluctuated like her other ideas, but had constant possession of her.\r\nFrom Edith she would sometimes look at Florence, and back again at\r\nEdith, in a manner that was wild enough; and sometimes she would try to\r\nlook elsewhere, as if to escape from her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face; but back to\r\nit she seemed forced to come, although it never sought hers unless\r\nsought, or troubled her with one single glance.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast concluded, Mrs Skewton, affecting to lean girlishly upon\r\nthe Major\xe2\x80\x99s arm, but heavily supported on the other side by Flowers the\r\nmaid, and propped up behind by Withers the page, was conducted to the\r\ncarriage, which was to take her, Florence, and Edith to Brighton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is Joseph absolutely banished?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, thrusting in his\r\npurple face over the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, is Cleopatra so hard-hearted\r\nas to forbid her faithful Antony Bagstock to approach the presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear you. You shall see me when I\r\ncome back, if you are very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Joseph, he may live in hope, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major; \xe2\x80\x9cor he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndie in despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra shuddered, and leaned back. \xe2\x80\x9cEdith, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch dreadful words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra. \xe2\x80\x9cHe uses such dreadful words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith signed to him to retire, gave the word to go on, and left the\r\nobjectionable Major to Mr Dombey. To whom he returned, whistling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, with his hands behind him,\r\nand his legs very wide asunder, \xe2\x80\x9ca fair friend of ours has removed to\r\nQueer Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Major?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be an\r\norphan-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey appeared to relish this waggish description of himself so\r\nvery little, that the Major wound up with the horse\xe2\x80\x99s cough, as an\r\nexpression of gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no use in disguising a fact.\r\nJoe is blunt, Sir. That\xe2\x80\x99s his nature. If you take old Josh at all, you\r\ntake him as you find him; and a devilish rusty, old rasper, of a\r\nclose-toothed, J. B. file, you do find him. Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s mother is on the move, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, with much philosophy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs Skewton\r\nis shaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShaken, Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cSmashed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange, however,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cand attention, may do much yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir, she never\r\nwrapped up enough. If a man don\xe2\x80\x99t wrap up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, taking in\r\nanother button of his buff waistcoat, \xe2\x80\x9che has nothing to fall back\r\nupon. But some people will die. They will do it. Damme, they will.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re obstinate. I tell you what, Dombey, it may not be ornamental;\r\nit may not be refined; it may be rough and tough; but a little of the\r\ngenuine old English Bagstock stamina, Sir, would do all the good in the\r\nworld to the human breed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter imparting this precious piece of information, the Major, who was\r\ncertainly true-blue, whatever other endowments he may have had or\r\nwanted, coming within the \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine old English\xe2\x80\x9d classification, which\r\nhas never been exactly ascertained, took his lobster-eyes and his\r\napoplexy to the club, and choked there all day.\r\n\r\nCleopatra, at one time fretful, at another self-complacent, sometimes\r\nawake, sometimes asleep, and at all times juvenile, reached Brighton\r\nthe same night, fell to pieces as usual, and was put away in bed; where\r\na gloomy fancy might have pictured a more potent skeleton than the\r\nmaid, who should have been one, watching at the rose-coloured curtains,\r\nwhich were carried down to shed their bloom upon her.\r\n\r\nIt was settled in high council of medical authority that she should\r\ntake a carriage airing every day, and that it was important she should\r\nget out every day, and walk if she could. Edith was ready to attend\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94always ready to attend her, with the same mechanical attention and\r\nimmovable beauty\xe2\x80\x94and they drove out alone; for Edith had an uneasiness\r\nin the presence of Florence, now that her mother was worse, and told\r\nFlorence, with a kiss, that she would rather they two went alone.\r\n\r\nMrs Skewton, on one particular day, was in the irresolute, exacting,\r\njealous temper that had developed itself on her recovery from her first\r\nattack. After sitting silent in the carriage watching Edith for some\r\ntime, she took her hand and kissed it passionately. The hand was\r\nneither given nor withdrawn, but simply yielded to her raising of it,\r\nand being released, dropped down again, almost as if it were\r\ninsensible. At this she began to whimper and moan, and say what a\r\nmother she had been, and how she was forgotten! This she continued to\r\ndo at capricious intervals, even when they had alighted: when she\r\nherself was halting along with the joint support of Withers and a\r\nstick, and Edith was walking by her side, and the carriage slowly\r\nfollowing at a little distance.\r\n\r\nIt was a bleak, lowering, windy day, and they were out upon the Downs\r\nwith nothing but a bare sweep of land between them and the sky. The\r\nmother, with a querulous satisfaction in the monotony of her complaint,\r\nwas still repeating it in a low voice from time to time, and the proud\r\nform of her daughter moved beside her slowly, when there came advancing\r\nover a dark ridge before them, two other figures, which in the\r\ndistance, were so like an exaggerated imitation of their own, that\r\nEdith stopped.\r\n\r\nAlmost as she stopped, the two figures stopped; and that one which to\r\nEdith\xe2\x80\x99s thinking was like a distorted shadow of her mother, spoke to\r\nthe other, earnestly, and with a pointing hand towards them. That one\r\nseemed inclined to turn back, but the other, in which Edith recognised\r\nenough that was like herself to strike her with an unusual feeling, not\r\nquite free from fear, came on; and then they came on together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this observation, she made while walking towards\r\nthem, for her stoppage had been momentary. Nearer observation showed\r\nher that they were poorly dressed, as wanderers about the country; that\r\nthe younger woman carried knitted work or some such goods for sale; and\r\nthat the old one toiled on empty-handed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, however far removed she was in dress, in dignity, in beauty,\r\nEdith could not but compare the younger woman with herself, still. It\r\nmay have been that she saw upon her face some traces which she knew\r\nwere lingering in her own soul, if not yet written on that index; but,\r\nas the woman came on, returning her gaze, fixing her shining eyes upon\r\nher, undoubtedly presenting something of her own air and stature, and\r\nappearing to reciprocate her own thoughts, she felt a chill creep over\r\nher, as if the day were darkening, and the wind were colder.\r\n\r\nThey had now come up. The old woman, holding out her hand\r\nimportunately, stopped to beg of Mrs Skewton. The younger one stopped\r\ntoo, and she and Edith looked in one another\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you have to sell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the woman, holding out her wares, without looking\r\nat them. \xe2\x80\x9cI sold myself long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lady, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe her,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the old woman to Mrs Skewton;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t believe what she says. She loves to talk like that. She\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nhandsome and undutiful daughter. She gives me nothing but reproaches,\r\nmy Lady, for all I have done for her. Look at her now, my Lady, how she\r\nturns upon her poor old mother with her looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mrs Skewton drew her purse out with a trembling hand, and eagerly\r\nfumbled for some money, which the other old woman greedily watched\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94their heads all but touching, in their hurry and decrepitude\xe2\x80\x94Edith\r\ninterposed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lady,\xe2\x80\x9d with a curtsey. \xe2\x80\x9cDown in Warwickshire. The morning\r\namong the trees. When you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me nothing. But the gentleman,\r\nhe give me something! Oh, bless him, bless him!\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled the old woman,\r\nholding up her skinny hand, and grinning frightfully at her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no use attempting to stay me, Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton,\r\nangrily anticipating an objection from her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing about it.\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t be dissuaded. I am sure this is an excellent woman, and a good\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lady, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d chattered the old woman, holding out her\r\navaricious hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThankee, my Lady. Lord bless you, my Lady. Sixpence\r\nmore, my pretty Lady, as a good mother yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd treated undutifully enough, too, my good old creature, sometimes,\r\nI assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skewton, whimpering. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! Shake hands with\r\nme. You\xe2\x80\x99re a very good old creature\xe2\x80\x94full of what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\xe2\x80\x94and all\r\nthat. You\xe2\x80\x99re all affection and et cetera, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my Lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you are; and so\xe2\x80\x99s that gentlemanly creature Grangeby. I\r\nmust really shake hands with you again. And now you can go, you know;\r\nand I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing the daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll show more gratitude,\r\nand natural what\xe2\x80\x99s-its-name, and all the rest of it\xe2\x80\x94but I never\r\nremember names\xe2\x80\x94for there never was a better mother than the good old\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s been to you. Come, Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the ruin of Cleopatra tottered off whimpering, and wiping its eyes\r\nwith a gingerly remembrance of rouge in their neighbourhood, the old\r\nwoman hobbled another way, mumbling and counting her money. Not one\r\nword more, nor one other gesture, had been exchanged between Edith and\r\nthe younger woman, but neither had removed her eyes from the other for\r\na moment. They had remained confronted until now, when Edith, as\r\nawakening from a dream, passed slowly on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a handsome woman,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered her shadow, looking after her; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\ngood looks won\xe2\x80\x99t save us. And you\xe2\x80\x99re a proud woman; but pride won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsave us. We had need to know each other when we meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nNew Voices in the Waves\r\n\r\n\r\nAll is going on as it was wont. The waves are hoarse with repetition of\r\ntheir mystery; the dust lies piled upon the shore; the sea-birds soar\r\nand hover; the winds and clouds go forth upon their trackless flight;\r\nthe white arms beckon, in the moonlight, to the invisible country far\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWith a tender melancholy pleasure, Florence finds herself again on the\r\nold ground so sadly trodden, yet so happily, and thinks of him in the\r\nquiet place, where he and she have many and many a time conversed\r\ntogether, with the water welling up about his couch. And now, as she\r\nsits pensive there, she hears in the wild low murmur of the sea, his\r\nlittle story told again, his very words repeated; and finds that all\r\nher life and hopes, and griefs, since\xe2\x80\x94in the solitary house, and in the\r\npageant it has changed to\xe2\x80\x94have a portion in the burden of the\r\nmarvellous song.\r\n\r\nAnd gentle Mr Toots, who wanders at a distance, looking wistfully\r\ntowards the figure that he dotes upon, and has followed there, but\r\ncannot in his delicacy disturb at such a time, likewise hears the\r\nrequiem of little Dombey on the waters, rising and falling in the lulls\r\nof their eternal madrigal in praise of Florence. Yes! and he faintly\r\nunderstands, poor Mr Toots, that they are saying something of a time\r\nwhen he was sensible of being brighter and not addle-brained; and the\r\ntears rising in his eyes when he fears that he is dull and stupid now,\r\nand good for little but to be laughed at, diminish his satisfaction in\r\ntheir soothing reminder that he is relieved from present responsibility\r\nto the Chicken, by the absence of that game head of poultry in the\r\ncountry, training (at Toots\xe2\x80\x99s cost) for his great mill with the Larkey\r\nBoy.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Toots takes courage, when they whisper a kind thought to him;\r\nand by slow degrees and with many indecisive stoppages on the way,\r\napproaches Florence. Stammering and blushing, Mr Toots affects\r\namazement when he comes near her, and says (having followed close on\r\nthe carriage in which she travelled, every inch of the way from London,\r\nloving even to be choked by the dust of its wheels) that he never was\r\nso surprised in all his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought Diogenes, too, Miss Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots,\r\nthrilled through and through by the touch of the small hand so\r\npleasantly and frankly given him.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Diogenes is there, and no doubt Mr Toots has reason to observe\r\nhim, for he comes straightway at Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s legs, and tumbles over\r\nhimself in the desperation with which he makes at him, like a very dog\r\nof Montargis. But he is checked by his sweet mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, Di, down. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember who first made us friends, Di? For\r\nshame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh! Well may Di lay his loving cheek against her hand, and run off, and\r\nrun back, and run round her, barking, and run headlong at anybody\r\ncoming by, to show his devotion. Mr Toots would run headlong at\r\nanybody, too. A military gentleman goes past, and Mr Toots would like\r\nnothing better than to run at him, full tilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiogenes is quite in his native air, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr\r\nToots.\r\n\r\nFlorence assents, with a grateful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cbeg your pardon, but if you would like\r\nto walk to Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s, I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence puts her arm in that of Mr Toots without a word, and they walk\r\naway together, with Diogenes going on before. Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s legs shake\r\nunder him; and though he is splendidly dressed, he feels misfits, and\r\nsees wrinkles, in the masterpieces of Burgess and Co., and wishes he\r\nhad put on that brightest pair of boots.\r\n\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s house, outside, has as scholastic and studious an air\r\nas ever; and up there is the window where she used to look for the pale\r\nface, and where the pale face brightened when it saw her, and the\r\nwasted little hand waved kisses as she passed. The door is opened by\r\nthe same weak-eyed young man, whose imbecility of grin at sight of Mr\r\nToots is feebleness of character personified. They are shown into the\r\nDoctor\xe2\x80\x99s study, where blind Homer and Minerva give them audience as of\r\nyore, to the sober ticking of the great clock in the hall; and where\r\nthe globes stand still in their accustomed places, as if the world were\r\nstationary too, and nothing in it ever perished in obedience to the\r\nuniversal law, that, while it keeps it on the roll, calls everything to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAnd here is Doctor Blimber, with his learned legs; and here is Mrs\r\nBlimber, with her sky-blue cap; and here Cornelia, with her sandy\r\nlittle row of curls, and her bright spectacles, still working like a\r\nsexton in the graves of languages. Here is the table upon which he sat\r\nforlorn and strange, the \xe2\x80\x9cnew boy\xe2\x80\x9d of the school; and hither comes the\r\ndistant cooing of the old boys, at their old lives in the old room on\r\nthe old principle!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToots,\xe2\x80\x9d says Doctor Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to see you, Toots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots chuckles in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso to see you, Toots, in such good company,\xe2\x80\x9d says Doctor Blimber.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, with a scarlet visage, explains that he has met Miss Dombey\r\nby accident, and that Miss Dombey wishing, like himself, to see the old\r\nplace, they have come together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will like,\xe2\x80\x9d says Doctor Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cto step among our young friends,\r\nMiss Dombey, no doubt. All fellow-students of yours, Toots, once. I\r\nthink we have no new disciples in our little portico, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nDoctor Blimber to Cornelia, \xe2\x80\x9csince Mr Toots left us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept Bitherstone,\xe2\x80\x9d returns Cornelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cBitherstone is new to Mr Toots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNew to Florence, too, almost; for, in the schoolroom, Bitherstone\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nlonger Master Bitherstone of Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94shows in collars and a\r\nneckcloth, and wears a watch. But Bitherstone, born beneath some Bengal\r\nstar of ill-omen, is extremely inky; and his Lexicon has got so\r\ndropsical from constant reference, that it won\xe2\x80\x99t shut, and yawns as if\r\nit really could not bear to be so bothered. So does Bitherstone its\r\nmaster, forced at Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s highest pressure; but in the yawn of\r\nBitherstone there is malice and snarl, and he has been heard to say\r\nthat he wishes he could catch \xe2\x80\x9cold Blimber\xe2\x80\x9d in India. He\xe2\x80\x99d precious\r\nsoon find himself carried up the country by a few of his\r\n(Bitherstone\xe2\x80\x99s) Coolies, and handed over to the Thugs; he can tell him\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBriggs is still grinding in the mill of knowledge; and Tozer, too; and\r\nJohnson, too; and all the rest; the older pupils being principally\r\nengaged in forgetting, with prodigious labour, everything they knew\r\nwhen they were younger. All are as polite and as pale as ever; and\r\namong them, Mr Feeder, B.A., with his bony hand and bristly head, is\r\nstill hard at it; with his Herodotus stop on just at present, and his\r\nother barrels on a shelf behind him.\r\n\r\nA mighty sensation is created, even among these grave young gentlemen,\r\nby a visit from the emancipated Toots; who is regarded with a kind of\r\nawe, as one who has passed the Rubicon, and is pledged never to come\r\nback, and concerning the cut of whose clothes, and fashion of whose\r\njewellery, whispers go about, behind hands; the bilious Bitherstone,\r\nwho is not of Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s time, affecting to despise the latter to the\r\nsmaller boys, and saying he knows better, and that he should like to\r\nsee him coming that sort of thing in Bengal, where his mother had got\r\nan emerald belonging to him that was taken out of the footstool of a\r\nRajah. Come now!\r\n\r\nBewildering emotions are awakened also by the sight of Florence, with\r\nwhom every young gentleman immediately falls in love, again; except, as\r\naforesaid, the bilious Bitherstone, who declines to do so, out of\r\ncontradiction. Black jealousies of Mr Toots arise, and Briggs is of\r\nopinion that he ain\xe2\x80\x99t so very old after all. But this disparaging\r\ninsinuation is speedily made nought by Mr Toots saying aloud to Mr\r\nFeeder, B.A., \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Feeder?\xe2\x80\x9d and asking him to come and dine\r\nwith him today at the Bedford; in right of which feats he might set up\r\nas Old Parr, if he chose, unquestioned.\r\n\r\nThere is much shaking of hands, and much bowing, and a great desire on\r\nthe part of each young gentleman to take Toots down in Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood graces; and then, Mr Toots having bestowed a chuckle on his old\r\ndesk, Florence and he withdraw with Mrs Blimber and Cornelia; and\r\nDoctor Blimber is heard to observe behind them as he comes out last,\r\nand shuts the door, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we will now resume our studies,\xe2\x80\x9d For\r\nthat and little else is what the Doctor hears the sea say, or has heard\r\nit saying all his life.\r\n\r\nFlorence then steals away and goes upstairs to the old bedroom with Mrs\r\nBlimber and Cornelia; Mr Toots, who feels that neither he nor anybody\r\nelse is wanted there, stands talking to the Doctor at the study-door,\r\nor rather hearing the Doctor talk to him, and wondering how he ever\r\nthought the study a great sanctuary, and the Doctor, with his round\r\nturned legs, like a clerical pianoforte, an awful man. Florence soon\r\ncomes down and takes leave; Mr Toots takes leave; and Diogenes, who has\r\nbeen worrying the weak-eyed young man pitilessly all the time, shoots\r\nout at the door, and barks a glad defiance down the cliff; while Melia,\r\nand another of the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s female domestics, looks out of an upper\r\nwindow, laughing \xe2\x80\x9cat that there Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d and saying of Miss Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nreally though, now\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t she like her brother, only prettier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots, who saw when Florence came down that there were tears upon\r\nher face, is desperately anxious and uneasy, and at first fears that he\r\ndid wrong in proposing the visit. But he is soon relieved by her saying\r\nshe is very glad to have been there again, and by her talking quite\r\ncheerfully about it all, as they walked on by the sea. What with the\r\nvoices there, and her sweet voice, when they come near Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and Mr Toots must leave her, he is so enslaved that he has not a\r\nscrap of free-will left; when she gives him her hand at parting, he\r\ncannot let it go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey, I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, in a sad fluster, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nif you would allow me to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smiling and unconscious look of Florence brings him to a dead stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would allow me to\xe2\x80\x94if you would not consider it a liberty, Miss\r\nDombey, if I was to\xe2\x80\x94without any encouragement at all, if I was to hope,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nFlorence looks at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, who feels that he is in for it now, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nreally am in that state of adoration of you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\ndo with myself. I am the most deplorable wretch. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the\r\ncorner of the Square at present, I should go down on my knees, and beg\r\nand entreat of you, without any encouragement at all, just to let me\r\nhope that I may\xe2\x80\x94may think it possible that you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you please, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Florence, for the moment quite\r\nalarmed and distressed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr Toots. Stop, if you please.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t say any more. As a kindness and a favour to me, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots is dreadfully abashed, and his mouth opens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been so good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so grateful to you,\r\nI have such reason to like you for being a kind friend to me, and I do\r\nlike you so much;\xe2\x80\x9d and here the ingenuous face smiles upon him with the\r\npleasantest look of honesty in the world; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am sure you are only\r\ngoing to say good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\r\nmean. It\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Miss Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d stammers Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nanything about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence, thank you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not of\r\nthe least consequence in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr Toots goes home to his hotel in a state of desperation, locks\r\nhimself into his bedroom, flings himself upon his bed, and lies there\r\nfor a long time; as if it were of the greatest consequence,\r\nnevertheless. But Mr Feeder, B.A., is coming to dinner, which happens\r\nwell for Mr Toots, or there is no knowing when he might get up again.\r\nMr Toots is obliged to get up to receive him, and to give him\r\nhospitable entertainment.\r\n\r\nAnd the generous influence of that social virtue, hospitality (to make\r\nno mention of wine and good cheer), opens Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and warms\r\nhim to conversation. He does not tell Mr Feeder, B.A., what passed at\r\nthe corner of the Square; but when Mr Feeder asks him \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it is to\r\ncome off?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Toots replies, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are certain subjects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nbrings Mr Feeder down a peg or two immediately. Mr Toots adds, that he\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what right Blimber had to notice his being in Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, and that if he thought he meant impudence by it, he\xe2\x80\x99d have him\r\nout, Doctor or no Doctor; but he supposes its only his ignorance. Mr\r\nFeeder says he has no doubt of it.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder, however, as an intimate friend, is not excluded from the\r\nsubject. Mr Toots merely requires that it should be mentioned\r\nmysteriously, and with feeling. After a few glasses of wine, he gives\r\nMiss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s health, observing, \xe2\x80\x9cFeeder, you have no idea of the\r\nsentiments with which I propose that toast.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Feeder replies, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyes, I have, my dear Toots; and greatly they redound to your honour,\r\nold boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Feeder is then agitated by friendship, and shakes hands;\r\nand says, if ever Toots wants a brother, he knows where to find him,\r\neither by post or parcel. Mr Feeder like-wise says, that if he may\r\nadvise, he would recommend Mr Toots to learn the guitar, or, at least\r\nthe flute; for women like music, when you are paying your addresses to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, and he has found the advantage of it himself.\r\n\r\nThis brings Mr Feeder, B.A., to the confession that he has his eye upon\r\nCornelia Blimber. He informs Mr Toots that he don\xe2\x80\x99t object to\r\nspectacles, and that if the Doctor were to do the handsome thing and\r\ngive up the business, why, there they are\xe2\x80\x94provided for. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis opinion that when a man has made a handsome sum by his business, he\r\nis bound to give it up; and that Cornelia would be an assistance in it\r\nwhich any man might be proud of. Mr Toots replies by launching wildly\r\nout into Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s praises, and by insinuations that sometimes he\r\nthinks he should like to blow his brains out. Mr Feeder strongly urges\r\nthat it would be a rash attempt, and shows him, as a reconcilement to\r\nexistence, Cornelia\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, spectacles and all.\r\n\r\nThus these quiet spirits pass the evening; and when it has yielded\r\nplace to night, Mr Toots walks home with Mr Feeder, and parts with him\r\nat Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s door. But Mr Feeder only goes up the steps, and\r\nwhen Mr Toots is gone, comes down again, to stroll upon the beach\r\nalone, and think about his prospects. Mr Feeder plainly hears the waves\r\ninforming him, as he loiters along, that Doctor Blimber will give up\r\nthe business; and he feels a soft romantic pleasure in looking at the\r\noutside of the house, and thinking that the Doctor will first paint it,\r\nand put it into thorough repair.\r\n\r\nMr Toots is likewise roaming up and down, outside the casket that\r\ncontains his jewel; and in a deplorable condition of mind, and not\r\nunsuspected by the police, gazes at a window where he sees a light, and\r\nwhich he has no doubt is Florence\xe2\x80\x99s. But it is not, for that is Mrs\r\nSkewton\xe2\x80\x99s room; and while Florence, sleeping in another chamber, dreams\r\nlovingly, in the midst of the old scenes, and their old associations\r\nlive again, the figure which in grim reality is substituted for the\r\npatient boy\xe2\x80\x99s on the same theatre, once more to connect it\xe2\x80\x94but how\r\ndifferently!\xe2\x80\x94with decay and death, is stretched there, wakeful and\r\ncomplaining. Ugly and haggard it lies upon its bed of unrest; and by\r\nit, in the terror of her unimpassioned loveliness\xe2\x80\x94for it has terror in\r\nthe sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s failing eyes\xe2\x80\x94sits Edith. What do the waves say, in the\r\nstillness of the night, to them?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith, what is that stone arm raised to strike me? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing, mother, but your fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my fancy! Everything is my fancy. Look! Is it possible that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, mother, there is nothing. Should I sit unmoved, if there were\r\nany such thing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnmoved?\xe2\x80\x9d looking wildly at her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s gone now\xe2\x80\x94and why are you so\r\nunmoved? That is not my fancy, Edith. It turns me cold to see you\r\nsitting at my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry! You seem always sorry. But it is not for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, she cries; and tossing her restless head from side to side\r\nupon her pillow, runs on about neglect, and the mother she has been,\r\nand the mother the good old creature was, whom they met, and the cold\r\nreturn the daughters of such mothers make. In the midst of her\r\nincoherence, she stops, looks at her daughter, cries out that her wits\r\nare going, and hides her face upon the bed.\r\n\r\nEdith, in compassion, bends over her and speaks to her. The sick old\r\nwoman clutches her round the neck, and says, with a look of horror,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith! we are going home soon; going back. You mean that I shall go\r\nhome again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mother, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what he said\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name, I never could remember\r\nnames\xe2\x80\x94Major\xe2\x80\x94that dreadful word, when we came away\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s not true?\r\nEdith!\xe2\x80\x9d with a shriek and a stare, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not that that is the matter\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight after night, the lights burn in the window, and the figure lies\r\nupon the bed, and Edith sits beside it, and the restless waves are\r\ncalling to them both the whole night long. Night after night, the waves\r\nare hoarse with repetition of their mystery; the dust lies piled upon\r\nthe shore; the sea-birds soar and hover; the winds and clouds are on\r\ntheir trackless flight; the white arms beckon, in the moonlight, to the\r\ninvisible country far away.\r\n\r\nAnd still the sick old woman looks into the corner, where the stone\r\narm\xe2\x80\x94part of a figure of some tomb, she says\xe2\x80\x94is raised to strike her. At\r\nlast it falls; and then a dumb old woman lies upon the bed, and she is\r\ncrooked and shrunk up, and half of her is dead.\r\n\r\nSuch is the figure, painted and patched for the sun to mock, that is\r\ndrawn slowly through the crowd from day to day; looking, as it goes,\r\nfor the good old creature who was such a mother, and making mouths as\r\nit peers among the crowd in vain. Such is the figure that is often\r\nwheeled down to the margin of the sea, and stationed there; but on\r\nwhich no wind can blow freshness, and for which the murmur of the ocean\r\nhas no soothing word. She lies and listens to it by the hour; but its\r\nspeech is dark and gloomy to her, and a dread is on her face, and when\r\nher eyes wander over the expanse, they see but a broad stretch of\r\ndesolation between earth and heaven.\r\n\r\nFlorence she seldom sees, and when she does, is angry with and mows at.\r\nEdith is beside her always, and keeps Florence away; and Florence, in\r\nher bed at night, trembles at the thought of death in such a shape, and\r\noften wakes and listens, thinking it has come. No one attends on her\r\nbut Edith. It is better that few eyes should see her; and her daughter\r\nwatches alone by the bedside.\r\n\r\nA shadow even on that shadowed face, a sharpening even of the sharpened\r\nfeatures, and a thickening of the veil before the eyes into a pall that\r\nshuts out the dim world, is come. Her wandering hands upon the coverlet\r\njoin feebly palm to palm, and move towards her daughter; and a voice\r\nnot like hers, not like any voice that speaks our mortal language\xe2\x80\x94says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor I nursed you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, without a tear, kneels down to bring her voice closer to the\r\nsinking head, and answers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, can you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStaring wide, she tries to nod in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you recollect the night before I married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head is motionless, but it expresses somehow that she does.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you then that I forgave your part in it, and prayed God to\r\nforgive my own. I told you that time past was at an end between us. I\r\nsay so now, again. Kiss me, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith touches the white lips, and for a moment all is still. A moment\r\nafterwards, her mother, with her girlish laugh, and the skeleton of the\r\nCleopatra manner, rises in her bed.\r\n\r\nDraw the rose-coloured curtains. There is something else upon its\r\nflight besides the wind and clouds. Draw the rose-coloured curtains\r\nclose!\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the event is sent to Mr Dombey in town, who waits upon\r\nCousin Feenix (not yet able to make up his mind for Baden-Baden), who\r\nhas just received it too. A good-natured creature like Cousin Feenix is\r\nthe very man for a marriage or a funeral, and his position in the\r\nfamily renders it right that he should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cupon my soul, I am very much shocked to\r\nsee you on such a melancholy occasion. My poor aunt! She was a devilish\r\nlively woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey replies, \xe2\x80\x9cVery much so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd made up,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9creally young, you know,\r\nconsidering. I am sure, on the day of your marriage, I thought she was\r\ngood for another twenty years. In point of fact, I said so to a man at\r\nBrooks\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94little Billy Joper\xe2\x80\x94you know him, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94man with a glass in\r\nhis eye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey bows a negative. \xe2\x80\x9cIn reference to the obsequies,\xe2\x80\x9d he hints,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is any suggestion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my life,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, stroking his chin, which he\r\nhas just enough of hand below his wristbands to do; \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Mausoleum down at my place, in the park, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s in bad repair, and, in point of fact, in a devil of a state. But\r\nfor being a little out at elbows, I should have had it put to rights;\r\nbut I believe the people come and make pic-nic parties there inside the\r\niron railings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey is clear that this won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon good church in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix,\r\nthoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cpure specimen of the Anglo-Norman style, and admirably\r\nwell sketched too by Lady Jane Finchbury\xe2\x80\x94woman with tight stays\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve spoilt it with whitewash, I understand, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a long\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Brighton itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey suggests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, Dombey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we could do better,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin\r\nFeenix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s on the spot, you see, and a very cheerful place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when,\xe2\x80\x9d hints Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cwould it be convenient?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make a point,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cof pledging myself for any\r\nday you think best. I shall have great pleasure (melancholy pleasure,\r\nof course) in following my poor aunt to the confines of the\xe2\x80\x94in point of\r\nfact, to the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, failing in the other turn of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould Monday do for leaving town?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday would suit me to perfection,\xe2\x80\x9d replies Cousin Feenix. Therefore\r\nMr Dombey arranges to take Cousin Feenix down on that day, and\r\npresently takes his leave, attended to the stairs by Cousin Feenix, who\r\nsays, at parting, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really excessively sorry, Dombey, that you\r\nshould have so much trouble about it;\xe2\x80\x9d to which Mr Dombey answers, \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, Cousin Feenix and Mr Dombey meet, and go down to\r\nBrighton, and representing, in their two selves, all the other mourners\r\nfor the deceased lady\xe2\x80\x99s loss, attend her remains to their place of\r\nrest. Cousin Feenix, sitting in the mourning-coach, recognises\r\ninnumerable acquaintances on the road, but takes no other notice of\r\nthem, in decorum, than checking them off aloud, as they go by, for Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s information, as \xe2\x80\x9cTom Johnson. Man with cork leg, from White\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nWhat, are you here, Tommy? Foley on a blood mare. The Smalder\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and so forth. At the ceremony Cousin Feenix is depressed,\r\nobserving, that these are the occasions to make a man think, in point\r\nof fact, that he is getting shaky; and his eyes are really moistened,\r\nwhen it is over. But he soon recovers; and so do the rest of Mrs\r\nSkewton\xe2\x80\x99s relatives and friends, of whom the Major continually tells\r\nthe club that she never did wrap up enough; while the young lady with\r\nthe back, who has so much trouble with her eyelids, says, with a little\r\nscream, that she must have been enormously old, and that she died of\r\nall kinds of horrors, and you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\r\n\r\nSo Edith\xe2\x80\x99s mother lies unmentioned of her dear friends, who are deaf to\r\nthe waves that are hoarse with repetition of their mystery, and blind\r\nto the dust that is piled upon the shore, and to the white arms that\r\nare beckoning, in the moonlight, to the invisible country far away. But\r\nall goes on, as it was wont, upon the margin of the unknown sea; and\r\nEdith standing there alone, and listening to its waves, has dank weed\r\ncast up at her feet, to strew her path in life withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nConfidential and Accidental\r\n\r\n\r\nAttired no more in Captain Cuttle\xe2\x80\x99s sable slops and sou\xe2\x80\x99-wester hat,\r\nbut dressed in a substantial suit of brown livery, which, while it\r\naffected to be a very sober and demure livery indeed, was really as\r\nself-satisfied and confident a one as tailor need desire to make, Rob\r\nthe Grinder, thus transformed as to his outer man, and all regardless\r\nwithin of the Captain and the Midshipman, except when he devoted a few\r\nminutes of his leisure time to crowing over those inseparable worthies,\r\nand recalling, with much applauding music from that brazen instrument,\r\nhis conscience, the triumphant manner in which he had disembarrassed\r\nhimself of their company, now served his patron, Mr Carker. Inmate of\r\nMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s house, and serving about his person, Rob kept his round\r\neyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling, and felt that he had\r\nneed to open them wider than ever.\r\n\r\nHe could not have quaked more, through his whole being, before the\r\nteeth, though he had come into the service of some powerful enchanter,\r\nand they had been his strongest spells. The boy had a sense of power\r\nand authority in this patron of his that engrossed his whole attention\r\nand exacted his most implicit submission and obedience. He hardly\r\nconsidered himself safe in thinking about him when he was absent, lest\r\nhe should feel himself immediately taken by the throat again, as on the\r\nmorning when he first became bound to him, and should see every one of\r\nthe teeth finding him out, and taxing him with every fancy of his mind.\r\nFace to face with him, Rob had no more doubt that Mr Carker read his\r\nsecret thoughts, or that he could read them by the least exertion of\r\nhis will if he were so inclined, than he had that Mr Carker saw him\r\nwhen he looked at him. The ascendancy was so complete, and held him in\r\nsuch enthralment, that, hardly daring to think at all, but with his\r\nmind filled with a constantly dilating impression of his patron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nirresistible command over him, and power of doing anything with him, he\r\nwould stand watching his pleasure, and trying to anticipate his orders,\r\nin a state of mental suspension, as to all other things.\r\n\r\nRob had not informed himself perhaps\xe2\x80\x94in his then state of mind it would\r\nhave been an act of no common temerity to inquire\xe2\x80\x94whether he yielded so\r\ncompletely to this influence in any part, because he had floating\r\nsuspicions of his patron\xe2\x80\x99s being a master of certain treacherous arts\r\nin which he had himself been a poor scholar at the Grinders\xe2\x80\x99 School.\r\nBut certainly Rob admired him, as well as feared him. Mr Carker,\r\nperhaps, was better acquainted with the sources of his power, which\r\nlost nothing by his management of it.\r\n\r\nOn the very night when he left the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s service, Rob, after\r\ndisposing of his pigeons, and even making a bad bargain in his hurry,\r\nhad gone straight down to Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s house, and hotly presented\r\nhimself before his new master with a glowing face that seemed to expect\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, scapegrace!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, glancing at his bundle \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nleft your situation and come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you please, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said, you know, when I come\r\nhere last\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Sir, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing at all, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob,\r\nwarned by the manner of this inquiry, and very much disconcerted.\r\n\r\nHis patron looked at him with a wide display of gums, and shaking his\r\nforefinger, observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to an evil end, my vagabond friend, I foresee. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nruin in store for you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you please, don\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, with his legs trembling\r\nunder him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Sir, I only want to work for you, Sir, and to\r\nwait upon you, Sir, and to do faithful whatever I\xe2\x80\x99m bid, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better do faithfully whatever you are bid,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his\r\npatron, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have anything to do with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the submissive Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that,\r\nSir. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll only be so good as try me, Sir! And if ever you find me\r\nout, Sir, doing anything against your wishes, I give you leave to kill\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, leaning back in his chair, and smiling at\r\nhim serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to what I\xe2\x80\x99d do to you, if you tried to\r\ndeceive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the abject Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would be down\r\nupon me dreadful, Sir. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt for to go and do it, Sir, not\r\nif I was bribed with golden guineas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThoroughly checked in his expectations of commendation, the crestfallen\r\nGrinder stood looking at his patron, and vainly endeavouring not to\r\nlook at him, with the uneasiness which a cur will often manifest in a\r\nsimilar situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have left your old service, and come here to ask me to take you\r\ninto mine, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you please, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, who, in doing so, had acted on\r\nhis patron\xe2\x80\x99s own instructions, but dared not justify himself by the\r\nleast insinuation to that effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know me, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Sir, yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, tumbling with his hat, and still\r\nfixed by Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMr Carker nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob expressed in a number of short bows his lively understanding of\r\nthis caution, and was bowing himself back to the door, greatly relieved\r\nby the prospect of getting on the outside of it, when his patron\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, calling him roughly back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been\xe2\x80\x94shut that\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob obeyed as if his life had depended on his alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been used to eaves-dropping. Do you know what that means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListening, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Rob hazarded, after some embarrassed reflection.\r\n\r\nHis patron nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd watching, and so forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do such a thing here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cupon my word and\r\nhonour, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir, I wish I may die if I would, Sir, for anything\r\nthat could be promised to me. I should consider it is as much as all\r\nthe world was worth, to offer to do such a thing, unless I was ordered,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not\xe2\x80\x9d You have been used, too, to babbling and\r\ntattling,\xe2\x80\x9d said his patron with perfect coolness. \xe2\x80\x9cBeware of that here,\r\nor you\xe2\x80\x99re a lost rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d and he smiled again, and again cautioned him\r\nwith his forefinger.\r\n\r\nThe Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s breath came short and thick with consternation. He tried\r\nto protest the purity of his intentions, but could only stare at the\r\nsmiling gentleman in a stupor of submission, with which the smiling\r\ngentleman seemed well enough satisfied, for he ordered him downstairs,\r\nafter observing him for some moments in silence, and gave him to\r\nunderstand that he was retained in his employment.\r\n\r\nThis was the manner of Rob the Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s engagement by Mr Carker, and\r\nhis awe-stricken devotion to that gentleman had strengthened and\r\nincreased, if possible, with every minute of his service.\r\n\r\nIt was a service of some months\xe2\x80\x99 duration, when early one morning, Rob\r\nopened the garden gate to Mr Dombey, who was come to breakfast with his\r\nmaster, by appointment. At the same moment his master himself came,\r\nhurrying forth to receive the distinguished guest, and give him welcome\r\nwith all his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, when he had assisted him to alight from\r\nhis horse, \xe2\x80\x9cto see you here, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. This is an extraordinary day in\r\nmy calendar. No occasion is very special to a man like you, who may do\r\nanything; but to a man like me, the case is widely different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a tasteful place here, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, condescending\r\nto stop upon the lawn, to look about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can afford to say so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in his lofty patronage, \xe2\x80\x9canyone might say so.\r\nAs far as it goes, it is a very commodious and well-arranged\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94quite elegant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as it goes, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker, with an air of\r\ndisparagement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wants that qualification. Well! we have said enough\r\nabout it; and though you can afford to praise it, I thank you\r\nnonetheless. Will you walk in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, entering the house, noticed, as he had reason to do, the\r\ncomplete arrangement of the rooms, and the numerous contrivances for\r\ncomfort and effect that abounded there. Mr Carker, in his ostentation\r\nof humility, received this notice with a deferential smile, and said he\r\nunderstood its delicate meaning, and appreciated it, but in truth the\r\ncottage was good enough for one in his position\xe2\x80\x94better, perhaps, than\r\nsuch a man should occupy, poor as it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps to you, who are so far removed, it really does look better\r\nthan it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his false mouth distended to its fullest\r\nstretch. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as monarchs imagine attractions in the lives of\r\nbeggars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe directed a sharp glance and a sharp smile at Mr Dombey as he spoke,\r\nand a sharper glance, and a sharper smile yet, when Mr Dombey, drawing\r\nhimself up before the fire, in the attitude so often copied by his\r\nsecond in command, looked round at the pictures on the walls. Cursorily\r\nas his cold eye wandered over them, Carker\xe2\x80\x99s keen glance accompanied\r\nhis, and kept pace with his, marking exactly where it went, and what it\r\nsaw. As it rested on one picture in particular, Carker hardly seemed to\r\nbreathe, his sidelong scrutiny was so cat-like and vigilant, but the\r\neye of his great chief passed from that, as from the others, and\r\nappeared no more impressed by it than by the rest.\r\n\r\nCarker looked at it\xe2\x80\x94it was the picture that resembled Edith\xe2\x80\x94as if it\r\nwere a living thing; and with a wicked, silent laugh upon his face,\r\nthat seemed in part addressed to it, though it was all derisive of the\r\ngreat man standing so unconscious beside him. Breakfast was soon set\r\nupon the table; and, inviting Mr Dombey to a chair which had its back\r\ntowards this picture, he took his own seat opposite to it as usual.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey was even graver than it was his custom to be, and quite\r\nsilent. The parrot, swinging in the gilded hoop within her gaudy cage,\r\nattempted in vain to attract notice, for Carker was too observant of\r\nhis visitor to heed her; and the visitor, abstracted in meditation,\r\nlooked fixedly, not to say sullenly, over his stiff neckcloth, without\r\nraising his eyes from the table-cloth. As to Rob, who was in\r\nattendance, all his faculties and energies were so locked up in\r\nobservation of his master, that he scarcely ventured to give shelter to\r\nthe thought that the visitor was the great gentleman before whom he had\r\nbeen carried as a certificate of the family health, in his childhood,\r\nand to whom he had been indebted for his leather smalls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cto ask how Mrs Dombey is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward obsequiously, as he made the inquiry, with his chin\r\nresting on his hand; and at the same time his eyes went up to the\r\npicture, as if he said to it, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, see, how I will lead him on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey reddened as he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey is quite well. You remind me, Carker, of some conversation\r\nthat I wish to have with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobin, you can leave us,\xe2\x80\x9d said his master, at whose mild tones Robin\r\nstarted and disappeared, with his eyes fixed on his patron to the last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that boy, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, when the enmeshed\r\nGrinder was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with magnificent indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot likely that a man like you would. Hardly possible,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nCarker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse.\r\nPerhaps you may remember having generously charged yourself with his\r\neducation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it that boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with a frown. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does little credit\r\nto his education, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he is a young rip, I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker, with a shrug.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bears that character. But the truth is, I took him into my service\r\nbecause, being able to get no other employment, he conceived (had been\r\ntaught at home, I daresay) that he had some sort of claim upon you, and\r\nwas constantly trying to dog your heels with his petition. And although\r\nmy defined and recognised connexion with your affairs is merely of a\r\nbusiness character, still I have that spontaneous interest in\r\neverything belonging to you, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped again, as if to discover whether he had led Mr Dombey far\r\nenough yet. And again, with his chin resting on his hand, he leered at\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sensible that you do not limit your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cService,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested his smiling entertainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I prefer to say your regard,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr Dombey; very sensible,\r\nas he said so, that he was paying him a handsome and flattering\r\ncompliment, \xe2\x80\x9cto our mere business relations. Your consideration for my\r\nfeelings, hopes, and disappointments, in the little instance you have\r\njust now mentioned, is an example in point. I am obliged to you,\r\nCarker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker bent his head slowly, and very softly rubbed his hands, as if\r\nhe were afraid by any action to disturb the current of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour allusion to it is opportune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, after a little\r\nhesitation; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it prepares the way to what I was beginning to say to\r\nyou, and reminds me that that involves no absolutely new relations\r\nbetween us, although it may involve more personal confidence on my part\r\nthan I have hitherto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDistinguished me with,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Carker, bending his head again: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not say to you how honoured I am; for a man like you well knows\r\nhow much honour he has in his power to bestow at pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey and myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, passing this compliment with\r\naugust self-denial, \xe2\x80\x9care not quite agreed upon some points. We do not\r\nappear to understand each other yet. Mrs Dombey has something to\r\nlearn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey is distinguished by many rare attractions; and has been\r\naccustomed, no doubt, to receive much adulation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the smooth,\r\nsleek watcher of his slightest look and tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where there is\r\naffection, duty, and respect, any little mistakes engendered by such\r\ncauses are soon set right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts instinctively flew back to the face that had\r\nlooked at him in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room when an imperious hand was\r\nstretched towards the door; and remembering the affection, duty, and\r\nrespect, expressed in it, he felt the blood rush to his own face quite\r\nas plainly as the watchful eyes upon him saw it there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey and myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9chad some discussion,\r\nbefore Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s death, upon the causes of my dissatisfaction; of\r\nwhich you will have formed a general understanding from having been a\r\nwitness of what passed between Mrs Dombey and myself on the evening\r\nwhen you were at our\xe2\x80\x94at my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I so much regretted being present,\xe2\x80\x9d said the smiling Carker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud as a man in my position necessarily must be of your familiar\r\nnotice\xe2\x80\x94though I give you no credit for it; you may do anything you\r\nplease without losing caste\xe2\x80\x94and honoured as I was by an early\r\npresentation to Mrs Dombey, before she was made eminent by bearing your\r\nname, I almost regretted that night, I assure you, that I had been the\r\nobject of such especial good fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat any man could, under any possible circumstances, regret the being\r\ndistinguished by his condescension and patronage, was a moral\r\nphenomenon which Mr Dombey could not comprehend. He therefore\r\nresponded, with a considerable accession of dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! And why,\r\nCarker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the confidential agent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs Dombey, never very\r\nmuch disposed to regard me with favourable interest\xe2\x80\x94one in my position\r\ncould not expect that, from a lady naturally proud, and whose pride\r\nbecomes her so well\xe2\x80\x94may not easily forgive my innocent part in that\r\nconversation. Your displeasure is no light matter, you must remember;\r\nand to be visited with it before a third party\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, arrogantly; \xe2\x80\x9cI presume that I am the first\r\nconsideration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Can there be a doubt about it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, with the\r\nimpatience of a man admitting a notorious and incontrovertible fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey becomes a secondary consideration, when we are both in\r\nquestion, I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know better than anyone, that you\r\nhave no need to ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your regret in the\r\nacquisition of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure, may be almost counterbalanced\r\nby your satisfaction in retaining my confidence and good opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the misfortune, I find,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cto have incurred\r\nthat displeasure. Mrs Dombey has expressed it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey has expressed various opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with\r\nmajestic coldness and indifference, \xe2\x80\x9cin which I do not participate, and\r\nwhich I am not inclined to discuss, or to recall. I made Mrs Dombey\r\nacquainted, some time since, as I have already told you, with certain\r\npoints of domestic deference and submission on which I felt it\r\nnecessary to insist. I failed to convince Mrs Dombey of the expediency\r\nof her immediately altering her conduct in those respects, with a view\r\nto her own peace and welfare, and my dignity; and I informed Mrs Dombey\r\nthat if I should find it necessary to object or remonstrate again, I\r\nshould express my opinion to her through yourself, my confidential\r\nagent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlended with the look that Carker bent upon him, was a devilish look at\r\nthe picture over his head, that struck upon it like a flash of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not hesitate to say to you that I\r\nwill carry my point. I am not to be trifled with. Mrs Dombey must\r\nunderstand that my will is law, and that I cannot allow of one\r\nexception to the whole rule of my life. You will have the goodness to\r\nundertake this charge, which, coming from me, is not unacceptable to\r\nyou, I hope, whatever regret you may politely profess\xe2\x80\x94for which I am\r\nobliged to you on behalf of Mrs Dombey; and you will have the goodness,\r\nI am persuaded, to discharge it as exactly as any other commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have only to command me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with a majestic indication of assent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhave only to command you. It is necessary that I should proceed in\r\nthis. Mrs Dombey is a lady undoubtedly highly qualified, in many\r\nrespects, to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do credit even to your choice,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Carker, with a yawning\r\nshow of teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if you please to adopt that form of words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in\r\nhis tone of state; \xe2\x80\x9cand at present I do not conceive that Mrs Dombey\r\ndoes that credit to it, to which it is entitled. There is a principle\r\nof opposition in Mrs Dombey that must be eradicated; that must be\r\novercome: Mrs Dombey does not appear to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey,\r\nforcibly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the idea of opposition to Me is monstrous and absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, in the City, know you better,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carker, with a smile from\r\near to ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know me better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. Though, indeed, I am\r\nbound to do Mrs Dombey the justice of saying, however inconsistent it\r\nmay seem with her subsequent conduct (which remains unchanged), that on\r\nmy expressing my disapprobation and determination to her, with some\r\nseverity, on the occasion to which I have referred, my admonition\r\nappeared to produce a very powerful effect.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey delivered\r\nhimself of those words with most portentous stateliness. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to\r\nhave the goodness, then, to inform Mrs Dombey, Carker, from me, that I\r\nmust recall our former conversation to her remembrance, in some\r\nsurprise that it has not yet had its effect. That I must insist upon\r\nher regulating her conduct by the injunctions laid upon her in that\r\nconversation. That I am not satisfied with her conduct. That I am\r\ngreatly dissatisfied with it. And that I shall be under the very\r\ndisagreeable necessity of making you the bearer of yet more unwelcome\r\nand explicit communications, if she has not the good sense and the\r\nproper feeling to adapt herself to my wishes, as the first Mrs Dombey\r\ndid, and, I believe I may add, as any other lady in her place would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first Mrs Dombey lived very happily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first Mrs Dombey had great good sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, in a\r\ngentlemanly toleration of the dead, \xe2\x80\x9cand very correct feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Dombey like her mother, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker.\r\n\r\nSwiftly and darkly, Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face changed. His confidential agent\r\neyed it keenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have approached a painful subject,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a soft regretful\r\ntone of voice, irreconcilable with his eager eye. \xe2\x80\x9cPray forgive me. I\r\nforget these chains of association in the interest I have. Pray forgive\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut for all he said, his eager eye scanned Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s downcast face\r\nnone the less closely; and then it shot a strange triumphant look at\r\nthe picture, as appealing to it to bear witness how he led him on\r\nagain, and what was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, looking here and there upon the table, and\r\nsaying in a somewhat altered and more hurried voice, and with a paler\r\nlip, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no occasion for apology. You mistake. The association is\r\nwith the matter in hand, and not with any recollection, as you suppose.\r\nI do not approve of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour towards my daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you may make that\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nwill make that, if you please\xe2\x80\x94matter of direct objection from me to Mrs\r\nDombey. You will please to tell her that her show of devotion for my\r\ndaughter is disagreeable to me. It is likely to be noticed. It is\r\nlikely to induce people to contrast Mrs Dombey in her relation towards\r\nmy daughter, with Mrs Dombey in her relation towards myself. You will\r\nhave the goodness to let Mrs Dombey know, plainly, that I object to it;\r\nand that I expect her to defer, immediately, to my objection. Mrs\r\nDombey may be in earnest, or she may be pursuing a whim, or she may be\r\nopposing me; but I object to it in any case, and in every case. If Mrs\r\nDombey is in earnest, so much the less reluctant should she be to\r\ndesist; for she will not serve my daughter by any such display. If my\r\nwife has any superfluous gentleness, and duty over and above her proper\r\nsubmission to me, she may bestow them where she pleases, perhaps; but I\r\nwill have submission first!\xe2\x80\x94Carker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, checking the\r\nunusual emotion with which he had spoken, and falling into a tone more\r\nlike that in which he was accustomed to assert his greatness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\nhave the goodness not to omit or slur this point, but to consider it a\r\nvery important part of your instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker bowed his head, and rising from the table, and standing\r\nthoughtfully before the fire, with his hand to his smooth chin, looked\r\ndown at Mr Dombey with the evil slyness of some monkish carving, half\r\nhuman and half brute; or like a leering face on an old water-spout. Mr\r\nDombey, recovering his composure by degrees, or cooling his emotion in\r\nhis sense of having taken a high position, sat gradually stiffening\r\nagain, and looking at the parrot as she swung to and fro, in her great\r\nwedding ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, after a silence, suddenly resuming\r\nhis chair, and drawing it opposite to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cbut let me\r\nunderstand. Mrs Dombey is aware of the probability of your making me\r\nthe organ of your displeasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Carker, quickly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey repeated, not without hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I told\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you tell her? You see,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\r\nwith a smile, and softly laying his velvet hand, as a cat might have\r\nlaid its sheathed claws, on Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s arm; \xe2\x80\x9cif I perfectly understand\r\nwhat is in your mind, I am so much more likely to be useful, and to\r\nhave the happiness of being effectually employed. I think I do\r\nunderstand. I have not the honour of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion. In my\r\nposition, I have no reason to expect it; but I take the fact to be,\r\nthat I have not got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsequently,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cyour making the communications to Mrs\r\nDombey through me, is sure to be particularly unpalatable to that\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with haughty reserve, and yet with\r\nsome embarrassment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s views upon the subject form no\r\npart of it as it presents itself to you and me, Carker. But it may be\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94pardon me\xe2\x80\x94do I misconceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I think you\r\ndescry in this, a likely means of humbling Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s pride\xe2\x80\x94I use the\r\nword as expressive of a quality which, kept within due bounds, adorns\r\nand graces a lady so distinguished for her beauty and\r\naccomplishments\xe2\x80\x94and, not to say of punishing her, but of reducing her\r\nto the submission you so naturally and justly require?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not accustomed, Carker, as you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cto give\r\nsuch close reasons for any course of conduct I think proper to adopt,\r\nbut I will gainsay nothing of this. If you have any objection to found\r\nupon it, that is indeed another thing, and the mere statement that you\r\nhave one will be sufficient. But I have not supposed, I confess, that\r\nany confidence I could entrust to you, would be likely to degrade you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! _I_ degraded!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cIn _your_ service!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94or to place you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cin a false position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ in a false position!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nproud\xe2\x80\x94delighted\xe2\x80\x94to execute your trust. I could have wished, I own, to\r\nhave given the lady at whose feet I would lay my humble duty and\r\ndevotion\xe2\x80\x94for is she not your wife!\xe2\x80\x94no new cause of dislike; but a wish\r\nfrom you is, of course, paramount to every other consideration on\r\nearth. Besides, when Mrs Dombey is converted from these little errors\r\nof judgment, incidental, I would presume to say, to the novelty of her\r\nsituation, I shall hope that she will perceive in the slight part I\r\ntake, only a grain\xe2\x80\x94my removed and different sphere gives room for\r\nlittle more\xe2\x80\x94of the respect for you, and sacrifice of all considerations\r\nto you, of which it will be her pleasure and privilege to garner up a\r\ngreat store every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey seemed, at the moment, again to see her with her hand\r\nstretched out towards the door, and again to hear through the mild\r\nspeech of his confidential agent an echo of the words, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can\r\nmake us stranger to each other than we are henceforth!\xe2\x80\x9d But he shook\r\noff the fancy, and did not shake in his resolution, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Carker, drawing his chair back to its\r\nold place\xe2\x80\x94for they had taken little breakfast as yet\xe2\x80\x94and pausing for an\r\nanswer before he sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this. You will be good enough to\r\nobserve, Carker, that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or\r\nmay be charged, admits of reply. You will be good enough to bring me no\r\nreply. Mrs Dombey is informed that it does not become me to temporise\r\nor treat upon any matter that is at issue between us, and that what I\r\nsay is final.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker signified his understanding of these credentials, and they\r\nfell to breakfast with what appetite they might. The Grinder also, in\r\ndue time reappeared, keeping his eyes upon his master without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s respite, and passing the time in a reverie of worshipful\r\ntenor. Breakfast concluded, Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s horse was ordered out again,\r\nand Mr Carker mounting his own, they rode off for the City together.\r\n\r\nMr Carker was in capital spirits, and talked much. Mr Dombey received\r\nhis conversation with the sovereign air of a man who had a right to be\r\ntalked to, and occasionally condescended to throw in a few words to\r\ncarry on the conversation. So they rode on characteristically enough.\r\nBut Mr Dombey, in his dignity, rode with very long stirrups, and a very\r\nloose rein, and very rarely deigned to look down to see where his horse\r\nwent. In consequence of which it happened that Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s horse, while\r\ngoing at a round trot, stumbled on some loose stones, threw him, rolled\r\nover him, and lashing out with his iron-shod feet, in his struggles to\r\nget up, kicked him.\r\n\r\nMr Carker, quick of eye, steady of hand, and a good horseman, was\r\nafoot, and had the struggling animal upon his legs and by the bridle,\r\nin a moment. Otherwise that morning\xe2\x80\x99s confidence would have been Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s last. Yet even with the flush and hurry of this action red\r\nupon him, he bent over his prostrate chief with every tooth disclosed,\r\nand muttered as he stooped down, \xe2\x80\x9cI have given good cause of offence to\r\nMrs Dombey now, if she knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey being insensible, and bleeding from the head and face, was\r\ncarried by certain menders of the road, under Carker\xe2\x80\x99s direction, to\r\nthe nearest public-house, which was not far off, and where he was soon\r\nattended by divers surgeons, who arrived in quick succession from all\r\nparts, and who seemed to come by some mysterious instinct, as vultures\r\nare said to gather about a camel who dies in the desert. After being at\r\nsome pains to restore him to consciousness, these gentlemen examined\r\ninto the nature of his injuries. One surgeon who lived hard by was\r\nstrong for a compound fracture of the leg, which was the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion also; but two surgeons who lived at a distance, and were only\r\nin that neighbourhood by accident, combated this opinion so\r\ndisinterestedly, that it was decided at last that the patient, though\r\nseverely cut and bruised, had broken no bones but a lesser rib or so,\r\nand might be carefully taken home before night. His injuries being\r\ndressed and bandaged, which was a long operation, and he at length left\r\nto repose, Mr Carker mounted his horse again, and rode away to carry\r\nthe intelligence home.\r\n\r\nCrafty and cruel as his face was at the best of times, though it was a\r\nsufficiently fair face as to form and regularity of feature, it was at\r\nits worst when he set forth on this errand; animated by the craft and\r\ncruelty of thoughts within him, suggestions of remote possibility\r\nrather than of design or plot, that made him ride as if he hunted men\r\nand women. Drawing rein at length, and slackening in his speed, as he\r\ncame into the more public roads, he checked his white-legged horse into\r\npicking his way along as usual, and hid himself beneath his sleek,\r\nhushed, crouched manner, and his ivory smile, as he best could.\r\n\r\nHe rode direct to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, alighted at the door, and begged\r\nto see Mrs Dombey on an affair of importance. The servant who showed\r\nhim to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s own room, soon returned to say that it was not Mrs\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s hour for receiving visitors, and that he begged pardon for not\r\nhaving mentioned it before.\r\n\r\nMr Carker, who was quite prepared for a cold reception, wrote upon a\r\ncard that he must take the liberty of pressing for an interview, and\r\nthat he would not be so bold as to do so, for the second time (this he\r\nunderlined), if he were not equally sure of the occasion being\r\nsufficient for his justification. After a trifling delay, Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid appeared, and conducted him to a morning room upstairs, where\r\nEdith and Florence were together.\r\n\r\nHe had never thought Edith half so beautiful before. Much as he admired\r\nthe graces of her face and form, and freshly as they dwelt within his\r\nsensual remembrance, he had never thought her half so beautiful.\r\n\r\nHer glance fell haughtily upon him in the doorway; but he looked at\r\nFlorence\xe2\x80\x94though only in the act of bending his head, as he came in\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nsome irrepressible expression of the new power he held; and it was his\r\ntriumph to see the glance droop and falter, and to see that Edith half\r\nrose up to receive him.\r\n\r\nHe was very sorry, he was deeply grieved; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say with what\r\nunwillingness he came to prepare her for the intelligence of a very\r\nslight accident. He entreated Mrs Dombey to compose herself. Upon his\r\nsacred word of honour, there was no cause of alarm. But Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFlorence uttered a sudden cry. He did not look at her, but at Edith.\r\nEdith composed and reassured her. She uttered no cry of distress. No,\r\nno.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey had met with an accident in riding. His horse had slipped,\r\nand he had been thrown.\r\n\r\nFlorence wildly exclaimed that he was badly hurt; that he was killed!\r\n\r\nNo. Upon his honour, Mr Dombey, though stunned at first, was soon\r\nrecovered, and though certainly hurt was in no kind of danger. If this\r\nwere not the truth, he, the distressed intruder, never could have had\r\nthe courage to present himself before Mrs Dombey. It was the truth\r\nindeed, he solemnly assured her.\r\n\r\nAll this he said as if he were answering Edith, and not Florence, and\r\nwith his eyes and his smile fastened on Edith.\r\n\r\nHe then went on to tell her where Mr Dombey was lying, and to request\r\nthat a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Florence in tears, \xe2\x80\x9cif I might venture to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker, having his eyes on Edith when he heard these words, gave her\r\na secret look and slightly shook his head. He saw how she battled with\r\nherself before she answered him with her handsome eyes, but he wrested\r\nthe answer from her\xe2\x80\x94he showed her that he would have it, or that he\r\nwould speak and cut Florence to the heart\xe2\x80\x94and she gave it to him. As he\r\nhad looked at the picture in the morning, so he looked at her\r\nafterwards, when she turned her eyes away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am directed to request,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the new housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94Mrs\r\nPipchin, I think, is the name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing escaped him. He saw, in an instant, that she was another slight\r\nof Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s on his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94may be informed that Mr Dombey wishes to have his bed prepared in his\r\nown apartments downstairs, as he prefers those rooms to any other. I\r\nshall return to Mr Dombey almost immediately. That every possible\r\nattention has been paid to his comfort, and that he is the object of\r\nevery possible solicitude, I need not assure you, Madam. Let me again\r\nsay, there is no cause for the least alarm. Even you may be quite at\r\nease, believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed himself out, with his extremest show of deference and\r\nconciliation; and having returned to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s room, and there\r\narranged for a carriage being sent after him to the City, mounted his\r\nhorse again, and rode slowly thither. He was very thoughtful as he went\r\nalong, and very thoughtful there, and very thoughtful in the carriage\r\non his way back to the place where Mr Dombey had been left. It was only\r\nwhen sitting by that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s couch that he was quite himself again,\r\nand conscious of his teeth.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of twilight, Mr Dombey, grievously afflicted with aches\r\nand pains, was helped into his carriage, and propped with cloaks and\r\npillows on one side of it, while his confidential agent bore him\r\ncompany upon the other. As he was not to be shaken, they moved at\r\nlittle more than a foot pace; and hence it was quite dark when he was\r\nbrought home. Mrs Pipchin, bitter and grim, and not oblivious of the\r\nPeruvian mines, as the establishment in general had good reason to\r\nknow, received him at the door, and freshened the domestics with\r\nseveral little sprinklings of wordy vinegar, while they assisted in\r\nconveying him to his room. Mr Carker remained in attendance until he\r\nwas safe in bed, and then, as he declined to receive any female\r\nvisitor, but the excellent Ogress who presided over his household,\r\nwaited on Mrs Dombey once more, with his report on her lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nHe again found Edith alone with Florence, and he again addressed the\r\nwhole of his soothing speech to Edith, as if she were a prey to the\r\nliveliest and most affectionate anxieties. So earnest he was in his\r\nrespectful sympathy, that on taking leave, he ventured\xe2\x80\x94with one more\r\nglance towards Florence at the moment\xe2\x80\x94to take her hand, and bending\r\nover it, to touch it with his lips.\r\n\r\nEdith did not withdraw the hand, nor did she strike his fair face with\r\nit, despite the flush upon her cheek, the bright light in her eyes, and\r\nthe dilation of her whole form. But when she was alone in her own room,\r\nshe struck it on the marble chimney-shelf, so that, at one blow, it was\r\nbruised, and bled; and held it from her, near the shining fire, as if\r\nshe could have thrust it in and burned it.\r\n\r\nFar into the night she sat alone, by the sinking blaze, in dark and\r\nthreatening beauty, watching the murky shadows looming on the wall, as\r\nif her thoughts were tangible, and cast them there. Whatever shapes of\r\noutrage and affront, and black foreshadowings of things that might\r\nhappen, flickered, indistinct and giant-like, before her, one resented\r\nfigure marshalled them against her. And that figure was her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nThe Watches of the Night\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence, long since awakened from her dream, mournfully observed the\r\nestrangement between her father and Edith, and saw it widen more and\r\nmore, and knew that there was greater bitterness between them every\r\nday. Each day\xe2\x80\x99s added knowledge deepened the shade upon her love and\r\nhope, roused up the old sorrow that had slumbered for a little time,\r\nand made it even heavier to bear than it had been before.\r\n\r\nIt had been hard\xe2\x80\x94how hard may none but Florence ever know!\xe2\x80\x94to have the\r\nnatural affection of a true and earnest nature turned to agony; and\r\nslight, or stern repulse, substituted for the tenderest protection and\r\nthe dearest care. It had been hard to feel in her deep heart what she\r\nhad felt, and never know the happiness of one touch of response. But it\r\nwas much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or Edith,\r\nso affectionate and dear to her, and to think of her love for each of\r\nthem, by turns, with fear, distrust, and wonder.\r\n\r\nYet Florence now began to do so; and the doing of it was a task imposed\r\nupon her by the very purity of her soul, as one she could not fly from.\r\nShe saw her father cold and obdurate to Edith, as to her; hard,\r\ninflexible, unyielding. Could it be, she asked herself with starting\r\ntears, that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such\r\ntreatment, and had pined away and died? Then she would think how proud\r\nand stately Edith was to everyone but her, with what disdain she\r\ntreated him, how distantly she kept apart from him, and what she had\r\nsaid on the night when they came home; and quickly it would come on\r\nFlorence, almost as a crime, that she loved one who was set in\r\nopposition to her father, and that her father knowing of it, must think\r\nof her in his solitary room as the unnatural child who added this wrong\r\nto the old fault, so much wept for, of never having won his fatherly\r\naffection from her birth. The next kind word from Edith, the next kind\r\nglance, would shake these thoughts again, and make them seem like black\r\ningratitude; for who but she had cheered the drooping heart of\r\nFlorence, so lonely and so hurt, and been its best of comforters! Thus,\r\nwith her gentle nature yearning to them both, feeling for the misery of\r\nboth, and whispering doubts of her own duty to both, Florence in her\r\nwider and expanded love, and by the side of Edith, endured more than\r\nwhen she had hoarded up her undivided secret in the mournful house, and\r\nher beautiful Mama had never dawned upon it.\r\n\r\nOne exquisite unhappiness that would have far outweighed this, Florence\r\nwas spared. She never had the least suspicion that Edith by her\r\ntenderness for her widened the separation from her father, or gave him\r\nnew cause of dislike. If Florence had conceived the possibility of such\r\nan effect being wrought by such a cause, what grief she would have\r\nfelt, what sacrifice she would have tried to make, poor loving girl,\r\nhow fast and sure her quiet passage might have been beneath it to the\r\npresence of that higher Father who does not reject his children\xe2\x80\x99s love,\r\nor spurn their tried and broken hearts, Heaven knows! But it was\r\notherwise, and that was well.\r\n\r\nNo word was ever spoken between Florence and Edith now, on these\r\nsubjects. Edith had said there ought to be between them, in that wise,\r\na division and a silence like the grave itself: and Florence felt she\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs her father was brought home, suffering and\r\ndisabled; and gloomily retired to his own rooms, where he was tended by\r\nservants, not approached by Edith, and had no friend or companion but\r\nMr Carker, who withdrew near midnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nice company he is, Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nprecious piece of goods! If ever he wants a character don\xe2\x80\x99t let him\r\ncome to me whatever he does, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very well to say \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Nipper,\r\nmuch exasperated; \xe2\x80\x9cbut raly begging your pardon we\xe2\x80\x99re coming to such\r\npasses that it turns all the blood in a person\xe2\x80\x99s body into pins and\r\nneedles, with their pints all ways. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake me, Miss Floy, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean nothing again your ma-in-law who has always treated me as a\r\nlady should though she is rather high I must say not that I have any\r\nright to object to that particular, but when we come to Mrs Pipchinses\r\nand having them put over us and keeping guard at your Pa\xe2\x80\x99s door like\r\ncrocodiles (only make us thankful that they lay no eggs!) we are a\r\ngrowing too outrageous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa thinks well of Mrs Pipchin, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand has a\r\nright to choose his housekeeper, you know. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you say don\xe2\x80\x99t, I never do\r\nI hope but Mrs Pipchin acts like early gooseberries upon me Miss, and\r\nnothing less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan was unusually emphatic and destitute of punctuation in her\r\ndiscourse on this night, which was the night of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nbrought home, because, having been sent downstairs by Florence to\r\ninquire after him, she had been obliged to deliver her message to her\r\nmortal enemy Mrs Pipchin; who, without carrying it in to Mr Dombey, had\r\ntaken upon herself to return what Miss Nipper called a huffish answer,\r\non her own responsibility. This, Susan Nipper construed into\r\npresumption on the part of that exemplary sufferer by the Peruvian\r\nmines, and a deed of disparagement upon her young lady, that was not to\r\nbe forgiven; and so far her emphatic state was special. But she had\r\nbeen in a condition of greatly increased suspicion and distrust, ever\r\nsince the marriage; for, like most persons of her quality of mind, who\r\nform a strong and sincere attachment to one in the different station\r\nwhich Florence occupied, Susan was very jealous, and her jealousy\r\nnaturally attached to Edith, who divided her old empire, and came\r\nbetween them. Proud and glad as Susan Nipper truly was, that her young\r\nmistress should be advanced towards her proper place in the scene of\r\nher old neglect, and that she should have her father\xe2\x80\x99s handsome wife\r\nfor her companion and protectress, she could not relinquish any part of\r\nher own dominion to the handsome wife, without a grudge and a vague\r\nfeeling of ill-will, for which she did not fail to find a disinterested\r\njustification in her sharp perception of the pride and passion of the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s character. From the background to which she had necessarily\r\nretired somewhat, since the marriage, Miss Nipper looked on, therefore,\r\nat domestic affairs in general, with a resolute conviction that no good\r\nwould come of Mrs Dombey: always being very careful to publish on all\r\npossible occasions, that she had nothing to say against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, who was sitting thoughtfully at her table, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis very late. I shall want nothing more tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I often wish for them\r\nold times when I sat up with you hours later than this and fell asleep\r\nthrough being tired out when you was as broad awake as spectacles, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve ma\xe2\x80\x99s-in-law to come and sit with you now Miss Floy and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthankful for it I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not a word to say against \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not forget who was my old companion when I had none, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Florence, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cnever!\xe2\x80\x9d And looking up, she put her arm\r\nround the neck of her humble friend, drew her face down to hers, and\r\nbidding her good-night, kissed it; which so mollified Miss Nipper, that\r\nshe fell a sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow my dear Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9clet me go downstairs again and\r\nsee how your Pa is, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re wretched about him, do let me go\r\ndownstairs again and knock at his door my own self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to bed. We shall hear more in the morning. I\r\nwill inquire myself in the morning. Mama has been down, I daresay;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFlorence blushed, for she had no such hope; \xe2\x80\x9cor is there now, perhaps.\r\nGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan was too much softened to express her private opinion on the\r\nprobability of Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s being in attendance on her husband, and\r\nsilently withdrew. Florence left alone, soon hid her head upon her\r\nhands as she had often done in other days, and did not restrain the\r\ntears from coursing down her face. The misery of this domestic discord\r\nand unhappiness; the withered hope she cherished now, if hope it could\r\nbe called, of ever being taken to her father\xe2\x80\x99s heart; her doubts and\r\nfears between the two; the yearning of her innocent breast to both; the\r\nheavy disappointment and regret of such an end as this, to what had\r\nbeen a vision of bright hope and promise to her; all crowded on her\r\nmind and made her tears flow fast. Her mother and her brother dead, her\r\nfather unmoved towards her, Edith opposed to him and casting him away,\r\nbut loving her, and loved by her, it seemed as if her affection could\r\nnever prosper, rest where it would. That weak thought was soon hushed,\r\nbut the thoughts in which it had arisen were too true and strong to be\r\ndismissed with it; and they made the night desolate.\r\n\r\nAmong such reflections there rose up, as there had risen up all day,\r\nthe image of her father, wounded and in pain, alone in his own room,\r\nuntended by those who should be nearest to him, and passing the tardy\r\nhours in lonely suffering. A frightened thought which made her start\r\nand clasp her hands\xe2\x80\x94though it was not a new one in her mind\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nmight die, and never see her or pronounce her name, thrilled her whole\r\nframe. In her agitation she thought, and trembled while she thought, of\r\nonce more stealing downstairs, and venturing to his door.\r\n\r\nShe listened at her own. The house was quiet, and all the lights were\r\nout. It was a long, long time, she thought, since she used to make her\r\nnightly pilgrimages to his door! It was a long, long time, she tried to\r\nthink, since she had entered his room at midnight, and he had led her\r\nback to the stair-foot!\r\n\r\nWith the same child\xe2\x80\x99s heart within her, as of old: even with the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s sweet timid eyes and clustering hair: Florence, as strange to\r\nher father in her early maiden bloom, as in her nursery time, crept\r\ndown the staircase listening as she went, and drew near to his room. No\r\none was stirring in the house. The door was partly open to admit air;\r\nand all was so still within, that she could hear the burning of the\r\nfire, and count the ticking of the clock that stood upon the\r\nchimney-piece.\r\n\r\nShe looked in. In that room, the housekeeper wrapped in a blanket was\r\nfast asleep in an easy chair before the fire. The doors between it and\r\nthe next were partly closed, and a screen was drawn before them; but\r\nthere was a light there, and it shone upon the cornice of his bed. All\r\nwas so very still that she could hear from his breathing that he was\r\nasleep. This gave her courage to pass round the screen, and look into\r\nhis chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was as great a start to come upon his sleeping face as if she had\r\nnot expected to see it. Florence stood arrested on the spot, and if he\r\nhad awakened then, must have remained there.\r\n\r\nThere was a cut upon his forehead, and they had been wetting his hair,\r\nwhich lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow. One of his arms,\r\nresting outside the bed, was bandaged up, and he was very white. But it\r\nwas not this, that after the first quick glance, and first assurance of\r\nhis sleeping quietly, held Florence rooted to the ground. It was\r\nsomething very different from this, and more than this, that made him\r\nlook so solemn in her eye.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen his face in all her life, but there had been upon\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94or she fancied so\xe2\x80\x94some disturbing consciousness of her. She had\r\nnever seen his face in all her life, but hope had sunk within her, and\r\nher timid glance had dropped before its stern, unloving, and repelling\r\nharshness. As she looked upon it now, she saw it, for the first time,\r\nfree from the cloud that had darkened her childhood. Calm, tranquil\r\nnight was reigning in its stead. He might have gone to sleep, for\r\nanything she saw there, blessing her.\r\n\r\nAwake, unkind father! Awake, now, sullen man! The time is flitting by;\r\nthe hour is coming with an angry tread. Awake!\r\n\r\nThere was no change upon his face; and as she watched it, awfully, its\r\nmotionless response recalled the faces that were gone. So they looked,\r\nso would he; so she, his weeping child, who should say when! so all the\r\nworld of love and hatred and indifference around them! When that time\r\nshould come, it would not be the heavier to him, for this that she was\r\ngoing to do; and it might fall something lighter upon her.\r\n\r\nShe stole close to the bed, and drawing in her breath, bent down, and\r\nsoftly kissed him on the face, and laid her own for one brief moment by\r\nits side, and put the arm, with which she dared not touch him, round\r\nabout him on the pillow.\r\n\r\nAwake, doomed man, while she is near! The time is flitting by; the hour\r\nis coming with an angry tread; its foot is in the house. Awake!\r\n\r\nIn her mind, she prayed to God to bless her father, and to soften him\r\ntowards her, if it might be so; and if not, to forgive him if he was\r\nwrong, and pardon her the prayer which almost seemed impiety. And doing\r\nso, and looking back at him with blinded eyes, and stealing timidly\r\naway, passed out of his room, and crossed the other, and was gone.\r\n\r\nHe may sleep on now. He may sleep on while he may. But let him look for\r\nthat slight figure when he wakes, and find it near him when the hour is\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nSad and grieving was the heart of Florence, as she crept upstairs. The\r\nquiet house had grown more dismal since she came down. The sleep she\r\nhad been looking on, in the dead of night, had the solemnity to her of\r\ndeath and life in one. The secrecy and silence of her own proceeding\r\nmade the night secret, silent, and oppressive. She felt unwilling,\r\nalmost unable, to go on to her own chamber; and turning into the\r\ndrawing-rooms, where the clouded moon was shining through the blinds,\r\nlooked out into the empty streets.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing drearily. The lamps looked pale, and shook as if\r\nthey were cold. There was a distant glimmer of something that was not\r\nquite darkness, rather than of light, in the sky; and foreboding night\r\nwas shivering and restless, as the dying are who make a troubled end.\r\nFlorence remembered how, as a watcher, by a sick-bed, she had noted\r\nthis bleak time, and felt its influence, as if in some hidden natural\r\nantipathy to it; and now it was very, very gloomy.\r\n\r\nHer Mama had not come to her room that night, which was one cause of\r\nher having sat late out of her bed. In her general uneasiness, no less\r\nthan in her ardent longing to have somebody to speak to, and to break\r\nthe spell of gloom and silence, Florence directed her steps towards the\r\nchamber where she slept.\r\n\r\nThe door was not fastened within, and yielded smoothly to her\r\nhesitating hand. She was surprised to find a bright light burning;\r\nstill more surprised, on looking in, to see that her Mama, but\r\npartially undressed, was sitting near the ashes of the fire, which had\r\ncrumbled and dropped away. Her eyes were intently bent upon the air;\r\nand in their light, and in her face, and in her form, and in the grasp\r\nwith which she held the elbows of her chair as if about to start up,\r\nFlorence saw such fierce emotion that it terrified her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith started; looking at her with such a strange dread in her face,\r\nthat Florence was more frightened than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, hurriedly advancing. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mama! what is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, shaking, and still looking at her\r\nin the same strange way. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had bad dreams, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not yet been to bed, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf-waking dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer features gradually softened; and suffering Florence to come closer\r\nto her, within her embrace, she said in a tender manner, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what does\r\nmy bird do here? What does my bird do here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been uneasy, Mama, in not seeing you tonight, and in not\r\nknowing how Papa was; and I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence stopped there, and said no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it late?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edith, fondly putting back the curls that mingled\r\nwith her own dark hair, and strayed upon her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery late. Near day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear day!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mama, what have you done to your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\nEdith drew it suddenly away, and, for a moment, looked at her with the\r\nsame strange dread (there was a sort of wild avoidance in it) as\r\nbefore; but she presently said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing. A blow.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d and then her bosom heaved, and she was weeping\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mama, what can I do, what should I do, to\r\nmake us happier? Is there anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that? Can it never be? If I speak now of what is in my\r\nthoughts, in spite of what we have agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\nnot blame me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cuseless. I have told you, dear, that I\r\nhave had bad dreams. Nothing can change them, or prevent them coming\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, gazing on her agitated face which\r\nseemed to darken as she looked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have dreamed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cof a pride that is all\r\npowerless for good, all powerful for evil; of a pride that has been\r\ngalled and goaded, through many shameful years, and has never recoiled\r\nexcept upon itself; a pride that has debased its owner with the\r\nconsciousness of deep humiliation, and never helped its owner boldly to\r\nresent it or avoid it, or to say, \xe2\x80\x98This shall not be!\xe2\x80\x99 a pride that,\r\nrightly guided, might have led perhaps to better things, but which,\r\nmisdirected and perverted, like all else belonging to the same\r\npossessor, has been self-contempt, mere hardihood and ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neither looked nor spoke to Florence now, but went on as if she\r\nwere alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have dreamed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cof such indifference and callousness,\r\narising from this self-contempt; this wretched, inefficient, miserable\r\npride; that it has gone on with listless steps even to the altar,\r\nyielding to the old, familiar, beckoning finger,\xe2\x80\x94oh mother, oh\r\nmother!\xe2\x80\x94while it spurned it; and willing to be hateful to itself for\r\nonce and for all, rather than to be stung daily in some new form. Mean,\r\npoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now with gathering and darkening emotion, she looked as she had\r\nlooked when Florence entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have dreamed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in a first late effort to achieve\r\na purpose, it has been trodden on, and trodden down by a base foot, but\r\nturns and looks upon him. I have dreamed that it is wounded, hunted,\r\nset upon by dogs, but that it stands at bay, and will not yield; no,\r\nthat it cannot if it would; but that it is urged on to hate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer clenched hand tightened on the trembling arm she had in hers, and\r\nas she looked down on the alarmed and wondering face, frown subsided.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have been nearly mad tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhumbled her proud head upon her neck and wept again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me! be near me! I have no hope but in you!\xe2\x80\x9d These words\r\nshe said a score of times.\r\n\r\nSoon she grew calmer, and was full of pity for the tears of Florence,\r\nand for her waking at such untimely hours. And the day now dawning,\r\nEdith folded her in her arms and laid her down upon her bed, and, not\r\nlying down herself, sat by her, and bade her try to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you are weary, dearest, and unhappy, and should rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed unhappy, dear Mama, tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are\r\nweary and unhappy, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when you lie asleep so near me, sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey kissed each other, and Florence, worn out, gradually fell into a\r\ngentle slumber; but as her eyes closed on the face beside her, it was\r\nso sad to think upon the face downstairs, that her hand drew closer to\r\nEdith for some comfort; yet, even in the act, it faltered, lest it\r\nshould be deserting him. So, in her sleep, she tried to reconcile the\r\ntwo together, and to show them that she loved them both, but could not\r\ndo it, and her waking grief was part of her dreams.\r\n\r\nEdith, sitting by, looked down at the dark eyelashes lying wet on the\r\nflushed cheeks, and looked with gentleness and pity, for she knew the\r\ntruth. But no sleep hung upon her own eyes. As the day came on she\r\nstill sat watching and waking, with the placid hand in hers, and\r\nsometimes whispered, as she looked at the hushed face, \xe2\x80\x9cBe near me,\r\nFlorence. I have no hope but in you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nA Separation\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the day, though not so early as the sun, uprose Miss Susan Nipper.\r\nThere was a heaviness in this young maiden\xe2\x80\x99s exceedingly sharp black\r\neyes, that abated somewhat of their sparkling, and suggested\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nnot their usual character\xe2\x80\x94the possibility of their being sometimes\r\nshut. There was likewise a swollen look about them, as if they had been\r\ncrying over-night. But the Nipper, so far from being cast down, was\r\nsingularly brisk and bold, and all her energies appeared to be braced\r\nup for some great feat. This was noticeable even in her dress, which\r\nwas much more tight and trim than usual; and in occasional twitches of\r\nher head as she went about the house, which were mightily expressive of\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nIn a word, she had formed a determination, and an aspiring one: it\r\nbeing nothing less than this\xe2\x80\x94to penetrate to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and\r\nhave speech of that gentleman alone. \xe2\x80\x9cI have often said I would,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked, in a threatening manner, to herself, that morning, with many\r\ntwitches of her head, \xe2\x80\x9cand now I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpurring herself on to the accomplishment of this desperate design,\r\nwith a sharpness that was peculiar to herself, Susan Nipper haunted the\r\nhall and staircase during the whole forenoon, without finding a\r\nfavourable opportunity for the assault. Not at all baffled by this\r\ndiscomfiture, which indeed had a stimulating effect, and put her on her\r\nmettle, she diminished nothing of her vigilance; and at last\r\ndiscovered, towards evening, that her sworn foe Mrs Pipchin, under\r\npretence of having sat up all night, was dozing in her own room, and\r\nthat Mr Dombey was lying on his sofa, unattended.\r\n\r\nWith a twitch\xe2\x80\x94not of her head merely, this time, but of her whole\r\nself\xe2\x80\x94the Nipper went on tiptoe to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s door, and knocked. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey. Susan encouraged herself with a final twitch, and\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, who was eyeing the fire, gave an amazed look at his visitor,\r\nand raised himself a little on his arm. The Nipper dropped a curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Sir, I wish to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey moved his lips as if he were repeating the words, but he\r\nseemed so lost in astonishment at the presumption of the young woman as\r\nto be incapable of giving them utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in your service, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, with her usual\r\nrapidity, \xe2\x80\x9cnow twelve \xe2\x80\x9cyear a waiting on Miss Floy my own young lady\r\nwho couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak plain when I first come here and I was old in this\r\nhouse when Mrs Richards was new, I may not be Meethosalem, but I am not\r\na child in arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, raised upon his arm and looking at her, offered no comment\r\non this preparatory statement of fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never was a dearer or a blesseder young lady than is my young\r\nlady, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I ought to know a great deal better than\r\nsome for I have seen her in her grief and I have seen her in her joy\r\n(there\xe2\x80\x99s not been much of it) and I have seen her with her brother and\r\nI have seen her in her loneliness and some have never seen her, and I\r\nsay to some and all\xe2\x80\x94I do!\xe2\x80\x9d and here the black-eyed shook her head, and\r\nslightly stamped her foot; \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s the blessedest and dearest angel\r\nis Miss Floy that ever drew the breath of life, the more that I was\r\ntorn to pieces Sir the more I\xe2\x80\x99d say it though I may not be a Fox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMartyr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey turned yet paler than his fall had made him, with indignation\r\nand astonishment; and kept his eyes upon the speaker as if he accused\r\nthem, and his ears too, of playing him false.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one could be anything but true and faithful to Miss Floy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I take no merit for my service of twelve year, for\r\nI love her\xe2\x80\x94yes, I say to some and all I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and here the black-eyed\r\nshook her head again, and slightly stamped her foot again, and checked\r\na sob; \xe2\x80\x9cbut true and faithful service gives me right to speak I hope,\r\nand speak I must and will now, right or wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, glaring at her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\ndare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean, Sir, is to speak respectful and without offence, but out,\r\nand how I dare I know not but I do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know my\r\nyoung lady Sir you don\xe2\x80\x99t indeed, you\xe2\x80\x99d never know so little of her, if\r\nyou did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, in a fury, put his hand out for the bell-rope; but there was\r\nno bell-rope on that side of the fire, and he could not rise and cross\r\nto the other without assistance. The quick eye of the Nipper detected\r\nhis helplessness immediately, and now, as she afterwards observed, she\r\nfelt she had got him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cis the most devoted and most patient\r\nand most dutiful and beautiful of daughters, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no gentleman,\r\nno Sir, though as great and rich as all the greatest and richest of\r\nEngland put together, but might be proud of her and would and ought. If\r\nhe knew her value right, he\xe2\x80\x99d rather lose his greatness and his fortune\r\npiece by piece and beg his way in rags from door to door, I say to some\r\nand all, he would!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan Nipper, bursting into tears, \xe2\x80\x9cthan\r\nbring the sorrow on her tender heart that I have seen it suffer in this\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cleave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging your pardon, not even if I am to leave the situation, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the steadfast Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cin which I have been so many years and\r\nseen so much\xe2\x80\x94although I hope you\xe2\x80\x99d never have the heart to send me from\r\nMiss Floy for such a cause\xe2\x80\x94will I go now till I have said the rest, I\r\nmay not be a Indian widow Sir and I am not and I would not so become\r\nbut if I once made up my mind to burn myself alive, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade my mind up to go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich was rendered no less clear by the expression of Susan Nipper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance, than by her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a person in your service, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the black-eyed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat has always stood more in awe of you than me and you may think how\r\ntrue it is when I make so bold as say that I have hundreds and hundreds\r\nof times thought of speaking to you and never been able to make my mind\r\nup to it till last night, but last night decided of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey, in a paroxysm of rage, made another grasp at the bell-rope\r\nthat was not there, and, in its absence, pulled his hair rather than\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Floy strive and strive when\r\nnothing but a child so sweet and patient that the best of women might\r\nhave copied from her, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her sitting nights together half the\r\nnight through to help her delicate brother with his learning, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nher helping him and watching him at other times\xe2\x80\x94some well know\r\nwhen\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her, with no encouragement and no help, grow up to be a\r\nlady, thank God! that is the grace and pride of every company she goes\r\nin, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always seen her cruelly neglected and keenly feeling of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I say to some and all, I have!\xe2\x80\x94and never said one word, but ordering\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self lowly and reverently towards one\xe2\x80\x99s betters, is not to be a\r\nworshipper of graven images, and I will and must speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anybody there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Dombey, calling out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the\r\nmen? where are the women? Is there no one there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left my dear young lady out of bed late last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan,\r\nnothing checked, \xe2\x80\x9cand I knew why, for you was ill Sir and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how ill and that was enough to make her wretched as I saw it did.\r\nI may not be a Peacock; but I have my eyes\xe2\x80\x94and I sat up a little in my\r\nown room thinking she might be lonesome and might want me, and I saw\r\nher steal downstairs and come to this door as if it was a guilty thing\r\nto look at her own Pa, and then steal back again and go into them\r\nlonely drawing-rooms, a-crying so, that I could hardly bear to hear it.\r\nI can not bear to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nipper, wiping her black eyes,\r\nand fixing them undauntingly on Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s infuriated face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthe first time I have heard it, not by many and many a time you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow your own daughter, Sir, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, Sir, I\r\nsay to some and all,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan Nipper, in a final burst, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na sinful shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hoity toity!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice of Mrs Pipchin, as the black\r\nbombazeen garments of that fair Peruvian Miner swept into the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan favoured Mrs Pipchin with a look she had invented expressly for\r\nher when they first became acquainted, and resigned the reply to Mr\r\nDombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Dombey, almost foaming. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this, Madam?\r\nYou who are at the head of this household, and bound to keep it in\r\norder, have reason to inquire. Do you know this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know very little good of her, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare\r\nyou come here, you hussy? Go along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the inflexible Nipper, merely honouring Mrs Pipchin with another\r\nlook, remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call it managing this establishment, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto leave a person like this at liberty to come and talk to me! A\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94in his own house\xe2\x80\x94in his own room\xe2\x80\x94assailed with the\r\nimpertinences of women-servants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Pipchin, with vengeance in her hard grey eye,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI exceedingly deplore it; nothing can be more irregular; nothing can\r\nbe more out of all bounds and reason; but I regret to say, Sir, that\r\nthis young woman is quite beyond control. She has been spoiled by Miss\r\nDombey, and is amenable to nobody. You know you\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nPipchin, sharply, and shaking her head at Susan Nipper. \xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, you\r\nhussy! Go along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you find people in my service who are not to be controlled, Mrs\r\nPipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, turning back towards the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what\r\nto do with them, I presume. You know what you are here for? Take her\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I know what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cand of course shall do\r\nit. Susan Nipper,\xe2\x80\x9d snapping her up particularly short, \xe2\x80\x9ca month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarning from this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, loftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t smile at me, you minx, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nknow the reason why! Go along with you this minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend to go this minute, you may rely upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voluble\r\nNipper. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been in this house waiting on my young lady a dozen\r\nyear and I won\xe2\x80\x99t stop in it one hour under notice from a person owning\r\nto the name of Pipchin trust me, Mrs P.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good riddance of bad rubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d said that wrathful old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cGet\r\nalong with you, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you carried out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy comfort is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, looking back at Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have\r\ntold a piece of truth this day which ought to have been told long\r\nbefore and can\xe2\x80\x99t be told too often or too plain and that no amount of\r\nPipchinses\xe2\x80\x94I hope the number of \xe2\x80\x99em mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be great\xe2\x80\x9d (here Mrs Pipchin\r\nuttered a very sharp \xe2\x80\x9cGo along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d and Miss Nipper repeated the\r\nlook) \xe2\x80\x9ccan unsay what I have said, though they gave a whole year full\r\nof warnings beginning at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the forenoon and never leaving\r\noff till twelve at night and died of the exhaustion which would be a\r\nJubilee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Miss Nipper preceded her foe out of the room; and\r\nwalking upstairs to her own apartments in great state, to the choking\r\nexasperation of the ireful Pipchin, sat down among her boxes and began\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\nFrom this soft mood she was soon aroused, with a very wholesome and\r\nrefreshing effect, by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that bold-faced slut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fell Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cintend to take her\r\nwarning, or does she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper replied from within that the person described did not\r\ninhabit that part of the house, but that her name was Pipchin, and she\r\nwas to be found in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saucy baggage!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs Pipchin, rattling at the handle of\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cGo along with you this minute. Pack up your things directly!\r\nHow dare you talk in this way to a gentle-woman who has seen better\r\ndays?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Miss Nipper rejoined from her castle, that she pitied the\r\nbetter days that had seen Mrs Pipchin; and that for her part she\r\nconsidered the worst days in the year to be about that lady\xe2\x80\x99s mark,\r\nexcept that they were much too good for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to make a noise at my door,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSusan Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cnor to contaminate the key-hole with your eye, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npacking up and going you may take your affidavit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dowager expressed her lively satisfaction at this intelligence, and\r\nwith some general opinions upon young hussies as a race, and especially\r\nupon their demerits after being spoiled by Miss Dombey, withdrew to\r\nprepare the Nipper\xe2\x80\x99s wages. Susan then bestirred herself to get her\r\ntrunks in order, that she might take an immediate and dignified\r\ndeparture; sobbing heartily all the time, as she thought of Florence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe object of her regret was not long in coming to her, for the news\r\nsoon spread over the house that Susan Nipper had had a disturbance with\r\nMrs Pipchin, and that they had both appealed to Mr Dombey, and that\r\nthere had been an unprecedented piece of work in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\r\nthat Susan was going. The latter part of this confused rumour, Florence\r\nfound to be so correct, that Susan had locked the last trunk and was\r\nsitting upon it with her bonnet on, when she came into her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to leave me! You!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for goodness gracious sake, Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak a word to me or I shall demean myself before them Pi-i-pchinses,\r\nand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x99em see me cry Miss Floy for worlds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl, my old friend! What shall I do\r\nwithout you! Can you bear to go away so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-n-o-o, my darling dear Miss Floy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Susan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my duty, Miss, I have indeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno fault of mine. I am quite resigned. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay my month or I\r\ncould never leave you then my darling and I must at last as well as at\r\nfirst, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me Miss Floy, for though I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty firm I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\na marble doorpost, my own dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Why is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d For Susan\r\nwas shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-n-no, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, for I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nand whatever you do don\xe2\x80\x99t put in a word for me to stop, for it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe and you\xe2\x80\x99d only wrong yourself, and so God bless you my own precious\r\nand forgive me any harm I have done, or any temper I have showed in all\r\nthese many years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith which entreaty, very heartily delivered, Susan hugged her mistress\r\nin her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling there\xe2\x80\x99s a many that may come to serve you and be glad to\r\nserve you and who\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you well and true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be one who\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you so affectionate as me or love you half as\r\ndearly, that\xe2\x80\x99s my comfort. Go-ood-bye, sweet Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you go, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her weeping mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a brother down in the country Miss\xe2\x80\x94a farmer in Essex,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe heart-broken Nipper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat keeps ever so many co-o-ows and pigs and\r\nI shall go down there by the coach and sto-op with him, and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nme, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got money in the Savings Banks my dear, and needn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nanother service just yet, which I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s own mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d Susan finished with a burst of sorrow, which was\r\nopportunely broken by the voice of Mrs Pipchin talking downstairs; on\r\nhearing which, she dried her red and swollen eyes, and made a\r\nmelancholy feint of calling jauntily to Mr Towlinson to fetch a cab and\r\ncarry down her boxes.\r\n\r\nFlorence, pale and hurried and distressed, but withheld from useless\r\ninterference even here, by her dread of causing any new division\r\nbetween her father and his wife (whose stern, indignant face had been a\r\nwarning to her a few moments since), and by her apprehension of being\r\nin some way unconsciously connected already with the dismissal of her\r\nold servant and friend, followed, weeping, downstairs to Edith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-room, whither Susan betook herself to make her parting\r\ncurtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, here\xe2\x80\x99s the cab, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the boxes, get along with you, do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Pipchin, presenting herself at the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your\r\npardon, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s orders are imperative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, sitting under the hands of her maid\xe2\x80\x94she was going out to\r\ndinner\xe2\x80\x94preserved her haughty face, and took not the least notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, who, in pursuance of her\r\nsystem, and in recollection of the Mines, was accustomed to rout the\r\nservants about, as she had routed her young Brighton boarders; to the\r\neverlasting acidulation of Master Bitherstone, \xe2\x80\x9cand the sooner this\r\nhouse sees your back the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan had no spirits even for the look that belonged to Ma Pipchin by\r\nright; so she dropped her curtsey to Mrs Dombey (who inclined her head\r\nwithout one word, and whose eye avoided everyone but Florence), and\r\ngave one last parting hug to her young mistress, and received her\r\nparting embrace in return. Poor Susan\xe2\x80\x99s face at this crisis, in the\r\nintensity of her feelings and the determined suffocation of her sobs,\r\nlest one should become audible and be a triumph to Mrs Pipchin,\r\npresented a series of the most extraordinary physiognomical phenomena\r\never witnessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towlinson, outside the door\r\nwith the boxes, addressing Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Mr Toots is in the\r\ndrawing-room, and sends his compliments, and begs to know how Diogenes\r\nand Master is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuick as thought, Florence glided out and hastened downstairs, where Mr\r\nToots, in the most splendid vestments, was breathing very hard with\r\ndoubt and agitation on the subject of her coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how de do, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last ejaculation was occasioned by Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s deep concern at the\r\ndistress he saw in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s face; which caused him to stop short in a\r\nfit of chuckles, and become an image of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are so friendly to me, and so\r\nhonest, that I am sure I may ask a favour of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll only name one,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me an appetite. To which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with some\r\nsentiment, \xe2\x80\x9cI have long been a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan, who is an old friend of mine, the oldest friend I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFlorence, \xe2\x80\x9cis about to leave here suddenly, and quite alone, poor girl.\r\nShe is going home, a little way into the country. Might I ask you to\r\ntake care of her until she is in the coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyou really do me an honour and a\r\nkindness. This proof of your confidence, after the manner in which I\r\nwas Beast enough to conduct myself at Brighton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, hurriedly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think of that. Then would you\r\nhave the kindness to\xe2\x80\x94to go? and to be ready to meet her when she comes\r\nout? Thank you a thousand times! You ease my mind so much. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem so desolate. You cannot think how grateful I feel to you, or what\r\na good friend I am sure you are!\xe2\x80\x9d and Florence in her earnestness\r\nthanked him again and again; and Mr Toots, in his earnestness, hurried\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94but backwards, that he might lose no glimpse of her.\r\n\r\nFlorence had not the courage to go out, when she saw poor Susan in the\r\nhall, with Mrs Pipchin driving her forth, and Diogenes jumping about\r\nher, and terrifying Mrs Pipchin to the last degree by making snaps at\r\nher bombazeen skirts, and howling with anguish at the sound of her\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94for the good duenna was the dearest and most cherished aversion\r\nof his breast. But she saw Susan shake hands with the servants all\r\nround, and turn once to look at her old home; and she saw Diogenes\r\nbound out after the cab, and want to follow it, and testify an\r\nimpossibility of conviction that he had no longer any property in the\r\nfare; and the door was shut, and the hurry over, and her tears flowed\r\nfast for the loss of an old friend, whom no one could replace. No one.\r\nNo one.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, like the leal and trusty soul he was, stopped the cabriolet\r\nin a twinkling, and told Susan Nipper of his commission, at which she\r\ncried more than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul and body!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, taking his seat beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel for you. Upon my word and honour I think you can hardly know your\r\nown feelings better than I imagine them. I can conceive nothing more\r\ndreadful than to have to leave Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan abandoned herself to her grief now, and it really was touching to\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, don\xe2\x80\x99t! at least I mean now do, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what, Mr Toots!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, come home to my place, and have some dinner before you start,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cook\xe2\x80\x99s a most respectable woman\xe2\x80\x94one of the most\r\nmotherly people I ever saw\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be delighted to make you\r\ncomfortable. Her son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, as an additional recommendation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas educated in the Bluecoat School, and blown up in a powder-mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan accepting this kind offer, Mr Toots conducted her to his\r\ndwelling, where they were received by the Matron in question who fully\r\njustified his character of her, and by the Chicken who at first\r\nsupposed, on seeing a lady in the vehicle, that Mr Dombey had been\r\ndoubled up, agreeably to his old recommendation, and Miss Dombey\r\nabducted. This gentleman awakened in Miss Nipper some considerable\r\nastonishment; for, having been defeated by the Larkey Boy, his visage\r\nwas in a state of such great dilapidation, as to be hardly presentable\r\nin society with comfort to the beholders. The Chicken himself\r\nattributed this punishment to his having had the misfortune to get into\r\nChancery early in the proceedings, when he was severely fibbed by the\r\nLarkey one, and heavily grassed. But it appeared from the published\r\nrecords of that great contest that the Larkey Boy had had it all his\r\nown way from the beginning, and that the Chicken had been tapped, and\r\nbunged, and had received pepper, and had been made groggy, and had come\r\nup piping, and had endured a complication of similar strange\r\ninconveniences, until he had been gone into and finished.\r\n\r\nAfter a good repast, and much hospitality, Susan set out for the\r\ncoach-office in another cabriolet, with Mr Toots inside, as before, and\r\nthe Chicken on the box, who, whatever distinction he conferred on the\r\nlittle party by the moral weight and heroism of his character, was\r\nscarcely ornamental to it, physically speaking, on account of his\r\nplasters; which were numerous. But the Chicken had registered a vow, in\r\nsecret, that he would never leave Mr Toots (who was secretly pining to\r\nget rid of him), for any less consideration than the good-will and\r\nfixtures of a public-house; and being ambitious to go into that line,\r\nand drink himself to death as soon as possible, he felt it his cue to\r\nmake his company unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe night-coach by which Susan was to go, was on the point of\r\ndeparture. Mr Toots having put her inside, lingered by the window,\r\nirresolutely, until the driver was about to mount; when, standing on\r\nthe step, and putting in a face that by the light of the lamp was\r\nanxious and confused, he said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Susan! Miss Dombey, you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she could\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she could be brought, you know\xe2\x80\x94not exactly at once, but\r\nin time\xe2\x80\x94in a long time\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to love me, you know? There!\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Mr\r\nToots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI should say, never.\r\nNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence. Good-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s of\r\nno consequence, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nThe Trusty Agent\r\n\r\n\r\nEdith went out alone that day, and returned home early. It was but a\r\nfew minutes after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when her carriage rolled along the\r\nstreet in which she lived.\r\n\r\nThere was the same enforced composure on her face, that there had been\r\nwhen she was dressing; and the wreath upon her head encircled the same\r\ncold and steady brow. But it would have been better to have seen its\r\nleaves and flowers reft into fragments by her passionate hand, or\r\nrendered shapeless by the fitful searches of a throbbing and bewildered\r\nbrain for any resting-place, than adorning such tranquillity. So\r\nobdurate, so unapproachable, so unrelenting, one would have thought\r\nthat nothing could soften such a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature, and that everything in\r\nlife had hardened it.\r\n\r\nArrived at her own door, she was alighting, when some one coming\r\nquietly from the hall, and standing bareheaded, offered her his arm.\r\nThe servant being thrust aside, she had no choice but to touch it; and\r\nshe then knew whose arm it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your patient, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a curled lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is doing very well. I have left\r\nhim for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her head, and was passing up the staircase, when he followed\r\nand said, speaking at the bottom:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam! May I beg the favour of a minute\xe2\x80\x99s audience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped and turned her eyes back \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an unseasonable time, Sir,\r\nand I am fatigued. Is your business urgent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very urgent, returned Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I am so fortunate as to have\r\nmet you, let me press my petition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down for a moment at his glistening mouth; and he looked up\r\nat her, standing above him in her stately dress, and thought, again,\r\nhow beautiful she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Miss Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the servant, aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning room, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow the way there!\xe2\x80\x9d Turning her eyes again on the attentive gentleman\r\nat the bottom of the stairs, and informing him with a slight motion of\r\nher head, that he was at liberty to follow, she passed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon! Madam! Mrs Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the soft and nimble\r\nCarker, at her side in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I be permitted to entreat that\r\nMiss Dombey is not present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe confronted him, with a quick look, but with the same\r\nself-possession and steadiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would spare Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nknowledge of what I have to say. At least, Madam, I would leave it to\r\nyou to decide whether she shall know of it or not. I owe that to you.\r\nIt is my bounden duty to you. After our former interview, it would be\r\nmonstrous in me if I did otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slowly withdrew her eyes from his face, and turning to the servant,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSome other room.\xe2\x80\x9d He led the way to a drawing-room, which he\r\nspeedily lighted up and then left them. While he remained, not a word\r\nwas spoken. Edith enthroned herself upon a couch by the fire; and Mr\r\nCarker, with his hat in his hand and his eyes bent upon the carpet,\r\nstood before her, at some little distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I hear you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, when the door was closed, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\nyou to hear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be addressed by Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9ceven in accents of\r\nunmerited reproach, is an honour I so greatly esteem, that although I\r\nwere not her servant in all things, I should defer to such a wish, most\r\nreadily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are charged by the man whom you have just now left, Sir;\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nCarker raised his eyes, as if he were going to counterfeit surprise,\r\nbut she met them, and stopped him, if such were his intention; \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\nany message to me, do not attempt to deliver it, for I will not receive\r\nit. I need scarcely ask you if you are come on such an errand. I have\r\nexpected you some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my misfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto be here, wholly against my will,\r\nfor such a purpose. Allow me to say that I am here for two purposes.\r\nThat is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis ended. Or, if you return to it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan Mrs Dombey believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, coming nearer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I would\r\nreturn to it in the face of her prohibition? Is it possible that Mrs\r\nDombey, having no regard to my unfortunate position, is so determined\r\nto consider me inseparable from my instructor as to do me great and\r\nwilful injustice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edith, bending her dark gaze full upon him, and\r\nspeaking with a rising passion that inflated her proud nostril and her\r\nswelling neck, and stirred the delicate white down upon a robe she\r\nwore, thrown loosely over shoulders that could bear its snowy\r\nneighbourhood, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you present yourself to me, as you have done,\r\nand speak to me of love and duty to my husband, and pretend to think\r\nthat I am happily married, and that I honour him? How dare you venture\r\nso to affront me, when you know\xe2\x80\x94_I_ do not know better, Sir: I have\r\nseen it in your every glance, and heard it in your every word\xe2\x80\x94that in\r\nplace of affection between us there is aversion and contempt, and that\r\nI despise him hardly less than I despise myself for being his!\r\nInjustice! If I had done justice to the torment you have made me feel,\r\nand to my sense of the insult you have put upon me, I should have slain\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had asked him why he did this. Had she not been blinded by her\r\npride and wrath, and self-humiliation,\xe2\x80\x94which she was, fiercely as she\r\nbent her gaze upon him,\xe2\x80\x94she would have seen the answer in his face. To\r\nbring her to this declaration.\r\n\r\nShe saw it not, and cared not whether it was there or no. She saw only\r\nthe indignities and struggles she had undergone and had to undergo, and\r\nwas writhing under them. As she sat looking fixedly at them, rather\r\nthan at him, she plucked the feathers from a pinion of some rare and\r\nbeautiful bird, which hung from her wrist by a golden thread, to serve\r\nher as a fan, and rained them on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe did not shrink beneath her gaze, but stood, until such outward signs\r\nof her anger as had escaped her control subsided, with the air of a man\r\nwho had his sufficient reply in reserve and would presently deliver it.\r\nAnd he then spoke, looking straight into her kindling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, and knew before today, that I have found no\r\nfavour with you; and I knew why. Yes. I knew why. You have spoken so\r\nopenly to me; I am so relieved by the possession of your confidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfidence!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with disdain.\r\n\r\nHe passed it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94that I will make no pretence of concealment. I did see from the\r\nfirst, that there was no affection on your part for Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94how could\r\nit possibly exist between such different subjects? And I have seen,\r\nsince, that stronger feelings than indifference have been engendered in\r\nyour breast\xe2\x80\x94how could that possibly be otherwise, either, circumstanced\r\nas you have been? But was it for me to presume to avow this knowledge\r\nto you in so many words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it for you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto feign that other belief, and\r\naudaciously to thrust it on me day by day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, it was,\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had done less, if I had\r\ndone anything but that, I should not be speaking to you thus; and I\r\nforesaw\xe2\x80\x94who could better foresee, for who has had greater experience of\r\nMr Dombey than myself?\xe2\x80\x94that unless your character should prove to be as\r\nyielding and obedient as that of his first submissive lady, which I did\r\nnot believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA haughty smile gave him reason to observe that he might repeat this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, which I did not believe,\xe2\x80\x94the time was likely to come, when such\r\nan understanding as we have now arrived at, would be serviceable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServiceable to whom, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you. I will not add to myself, as warning me to refrain even from\r\nthat limited commendation of Mr Dombey, in which I can honestly\r\nindulge, in order that I may not have the misfortune of saying anything\r\ndistasteful to one whose aversion and contempt,\xe2\x80\x9d with great expression,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care so keen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it honest in you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cto confess to your \xe2\x80\x98limited\r\ncommendation,\xe2\x80\x99 and to speak in that tone of disparagement, even of him:\r\nbeing his chief counsellor and flatterer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCounsellor,\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cFlatterer,\xe2\x80\x94no. A little reservation I\r\nfear I must confess to. But our interest and convenience commonly\r\noblige many of us to make professions that we cannot feel. We have\r\npartnerships of interest and convenience, friendships of interest and\r\nconvenience, dealings of interest and convenience, marriages of\r\ninterest and convenience, every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bit her blood-red lip; but without wavering in the dark, stern\r\nwatch she kept upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, sitting down in a chair that was near her,\r\nwith an air of the most profound and most considerate respect, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nshould I hesitate now, being altogether devoted to your service, to\r\nspeak plainly? It was natural that a lady, endowed as you are, should\r\nthink it feasible to change her husband\xe2\x80\x99s character in some respects,\r\nand mould him to a better form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not natural to me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI had never any\r\nexpectation or intention of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proud undaunted face showed him it was resolute to wear no mask he\r\noffered, but was set upon a reckless disclosure of itself, indifferent\r\nto any aspect in which it might present itself to such as he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least it was natural,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should deem it quite\r\npossible to live with Mr Dombey as his wife, at once without submitting\r\nto him, and without coming into such violent collision with him. But,\r\nMadam, you did not know Mr Dombey (as you have since ascertained), when\r\nyou thought that. You did not know how exacting and how proud he is, or\r\nhow he is, if I may say so, the slave of his own greatness, and goes\r\nyoked to his own triumphal car like a beast of burden, with no idea on\r\nearth but that it is behind him and is to be drawn on, over everything\r\nand through everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis teeth gleamed through his malicious relish of this conceit, as he\r\nwent on talking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey is really capable of no more true consideration for you,\r\nMadam, than for me. The comparison is an extreme one; I intend it to be\r\nso; but quite just. Mr Dombey, in the plenitude of his power, asked\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I had it from his own lips yesterday morning\xe2\x80\x94to be his go-between to\r\nyou, because he knows I am not agreeable to you, and because he intends\r\nthat I shall be a punishment for your contumacy; and besides that,\r\nbecause he really does consider, that I, his paid servant, am an\r\nambassador whom it is derogatory to the dignity\xe2\x80\x94not of the lady to whom\r\nI have the happiness of speaking; she has no existence in his mind\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nof his wife, a part of himself, to receive. You may imagine how\r\nregardless of me, how obtuse to the possibility of my having any\r\nindividual sentiment or opinion he is, when he tells me, openly, that I\r\nam so employed. You know how perfectly indifferent to your feelings he\r\nis, when he threatens you with such a messenger. As you, of course,\r\nhave not forgotten that he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched him still attentively. But he watched her too; and he saw\r\nthat this indication of a knowledge on his part, of something that had\r\npassed between herself and her husband, rankled and smarted in her\r\nhaughty breast, like a poisoned arrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not recall all this to widen the breach between yourself and Mr\r\nDombey, Madam\xe2\x80\x94Heaven forbid! what would it profit me?\xe2\x80\x94but as an example\r\nof the hopelessness of impressing Mr Dombey with a sense that anybody\r\nis to be considered when he is in question. We who are about him, have,\r\nin our various positions, done our part, I daresay, to confirm him in\r\nhis way of thinking; but if we had not done so, others would\xe2\x80\x94or they\r\nwould not have been about him; and it has always been, from the\r\nbeginning, the very staple of his life. Mr Dombey has had to deal, in\r\nshort, with none but submissive and dependent persons, who have bowed\r\nthe knee, and bent the neck, before him. He has never known what it is\r\nto have angry pride and strong resentment opposed to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will know it now!\xe2\x80\x9d she seemed to say; though her lips did not\r\npart, nor her eyes falter. He saw the soft down tremble once again, and\r\nhe saw her lay the plumage of the beautiful bird against her bosom for\r\na moment; and he unfolded one more ring of the coil into which he had\r\ngathered himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey, though a most honourable gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis so prone\r\nto pervert even facts to his own view, when he is at all opposed, in\r\nconsequence of the warp in his mind, that he\xe2\x80\x94can I give a better\r\ninstance than this!\xe2\x80\x94he sincerely believes (you will excuse the folly of\r\nwhat I am about to say; it not being mine) that his severe expression\r\nof opinion to his present wife, on a certain special occasion she may\r\nremember, before the lamented death of Mrs Skewton, produced a\r\nwithering effect, and for the moment quite subdued her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith laughed. How harshly and unmusically need not be described. It is\r\nenough that he was glad to hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done with this. Your own opinions are so\r\nstrong, and, I am persuaded, so unalterable,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated those words\r\nslowly and with great emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am almost afraid to incur your\r\ndispleasure anew, when I say that in spite of these defects and my full\r\nknowledge of them, I have become habituated to Mr Dombey, and esteem\r\nhim. But when I say so, it is not, believe me, for the mere sake of\r\nvaunting a feeling that is so utterly at variance with your own, and\r\nfor which you can have no sympathy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh how distinct and plain and\r\nemphasized this was!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut to give you an assurance of the zeal with\r\nwhich, in this unhappy matter, I am yours, and the indignation with\r\nwhich I regard the part I am to fill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat as if she were afraid to take her eyes from his face.\r\n\r\nAnd now to unwind the last ring of the coil!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is growing late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are, as you\r\nsaid, fatigued. But the second object of this interview, I must not\r\nforget. I must recommend you, I must entreat you in the most earnest\r\nmanner, for sufficient reasons that I have, to be cautious in your\r\ndemonstrations of regard for Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCautious! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be careful how you exhibit too much affection for that young lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much affection, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, knitting her broad brow and\r\nrising. \xe2\x80\x9cWho judges my affection, or measures it out? You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not I who do so.\xe2\x80\x9d He was, or feigned to be, perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not guess who then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not choose to guess,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a little hesitation; meantime they had been, and\r\nstill were, regarding each other as before; \xe2\x80\x9cI am in a difficulty here.\r\nYou have told me you will receive no message, and you have forbidden me\r\nto return to that subject; but the two subjects are so closely\r\nentwined, I find, that unless you will accept this vague caution from\r\none who has now the honour to possess your confidence, though the way\r\nto it has been through your displeasure, I must violate the injunction\r\nyou have laid upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that you are free to do so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cDo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo pale, so trembling, so impassioned! He had not miscalculated the\r\neffect then!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis instructions were,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should inform\r\nyou that your demeanour towards Miss Dombey is not agreeable to him.\r\nThat it suggests comparisons to him which are not favourable to\r\nhimself. That he desires it may be wholly changed; and that if you are\r\nin earnest, he is confident it will be; for your continued show of\r\naffection will not benefit its object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a threat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a threat,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in his voiceless manner of assent:\r\nadding aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not directed against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProud, erect, and dignified, as she stood confronting him; and looking\r\nthrough him as she did, with her full bright flashing eye; and smiling,\r\nas she was, with scorn and bitterness; she sunk as if the ground had\r\ndropped beneath her, and in an instant would have fallen on the floor,\r\nbut that he caught her in his arms. As instantaneously she threw him\r\noff, the moment that he touched her, and, drawing back, confronted him\r\nagain, immoveable, with her hand stretched out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to leave me. Say no more tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel the urgency of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is impossible\r\nto say what unforeseen consequences might arise, or how soon, from your\r\nbeing unacquainted with his state of mind. I understand Miss Dombey is\r\nconcerned, now, at the dismissal of her old servant, which is likely to\r\nhave been a minor consequence in itself. You don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me for\r\nrequesting that Miss Dombey might not be present. May I hope so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not. Please to leave me, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that your regard for the young lady, which is very sincere and\r\nstrong, I am well persuaded, would render it a great unhappiness to\r\nyou, ever to be a prey to the reflection that you had injured her\r\nposition and ruined her future hopes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker hurriedly, but\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more tonight. Leave me, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be here constantly in my attendance upon him, and in the\r\ntransaction of business matters. You will allow me to see you again,\r\nand to consult what should be done, and learn your wishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe motioned him towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot even decide whether to tell him I have spoken to you yet; or\r\nto lead him to suppose that I have deferred doing so, for want of\r\nopportunity, or for any other reason. It will be necessary that you\r\nshould enable me to consult with you very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any time but now,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand, when I wish to see you, that Miss Dombey is not\r\nto be present; and that I seek an interview as one who has the\r\nhappiness to possess your confidence, and who comes to render you every\r\nassistance in his power, and, perhaps, on many occasions, to ward off\r\nevil from her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking at him still with the same apparent dread of releasing him for\r\na moment from the influence of her steady gaze, whatever that might be,\r\nshe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d and once more bade him go.\r\n\r\nHe bowed, as if in compliance; but turning back, when he had nearly\r\nreached the door, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am forgiven, and have explained my fault. May I\xe2\x80\x94for Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, and for my own\xe2\x80\x94take your hand before I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him the gloved hand she had maimed last night. He took it in\r\none of his, and kissed it, and withdrew. And when he had closed the\r\ndoor, he waved the hand with which he had taken hers, and thrust it in\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\nEdith saw no one that night, but locked her door, and kept herself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nShe did not weep; she showed no greater agitation, outwardly, than when\r\nshe was riding home. She laid as proud a head upon her pillow as she\r\nhad borne in her carriage; and her prayer ran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay this man be a liar! For if he has spoken truth, she is lost to me,\r\nand I have no hope left!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis man, meanwhile, went home musing to bed, thinking, with a dainty\r\npleasure, how imperious her passion was, how she had sat before him in\r\nher beauty, with the dark eyes that had never turned away but once; how\r\nthe white down had fluttered; how the bird\xe2\x80\x99s feathers had been strewn\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nRecognizant and Reflective\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong sundry minor alterations in Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s life and habits that\r\nbegan to take place at this time, none was more remarkable than the\r\nextraordinary diligence with which he applied himself to business, and\r\nthe closeness with which he investigated every detail that the affairs\r\nof the House laid open to him. Always active and penetrating in such\r\nmatters, his lynx-eyed vigilance now increased twenty-fold. Not only\r\ndid his weary watch keep pace with every present point that every day\r\npresented to him in some new form, but in the midst of these engrossing\r\noccupations he found leisure\xe2\x80\x94that is, he made it\xe2\x80\x94to review the past\r\ntransactions of the Firm, and his share in them, during a long series\r\nof years. Frequently when the clerks were all gone, the offices dark\r\nand empty, and all similar places of business shut up, Mr Carker, with\r\nthe whole anatomy of the iron room laid bare before him, would explore\r\nthe mysteries of books and papers, with the patient progress of a man\r\nwho was dissecting the minutest nerves and fibres of his subject.\r\nPerch, the messenger, who usually remained on these occasions, to\r\nentertain himself with the perusal of the Price Current by the light of\r\none candle, or to doze over the fire in the outer office, at the\r\nimminent risk every moment of diving head foremost into the coal-box,\r\ncould not withhold the tribute of his admiration from this zealous\r\nconduct, although it much contracted his domestic enjoyments; and\r\nagain, and again, expatiated to Mrs Perch (now nursing twins) on the\r\nindustry and acuteness of their managing gentleman in the City.\r\n\r\nThe same increased and sharp attention that Mr Carker bestowed on the\r\nbusiness of the House, he applied to his own personal affairs. Though\r\nnot a partner in the concern\xe2\x80\x94a distinction hitherto reserved solely to\r\ninheritors of the great name of Dombey\xe2\x80\x94he was in the receipt of some\r\npercentage on its dealings; and, participating in all its facilities\r\nfor the employment of money to advantage, was considered, by the\r\nminnows among the tritons of the East, a rich man. It began to be said,\r\namong these shrewd observers, that Jem Carker, of Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s, was looking\r\nabout him to see what he was worth; and that he was calling in his\r\nmoney at a good time, like the long-headed fellow he was; and bets were\r\neven offered on the Stock Exchange that Jem was going to marry a rich\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\nYet these cares did not in the least interfere with Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwatching of his chief, or with his cleanness, neatness, sleekness, or\r\nany cat-like quality he possessed. It was not so much that there was a\r\nchange in him, in reference to any of his habits, as that the whole man\r\nwas intensified. Everything that had been observable in him before, was\r\nobservable now, but with a greater amount of concentration. He did each\r\nsingle thing, as if he did nothing else\xe2\x80\x94a pretty certain indication in\r\na man of that range of ability and purpose, that he is doing something\r\nwhich sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers.\r\n\r\nThe only decided alteration in him was, that as he rode to and fro\r\nalong the streets, he would fall into deep fits of musing, like that in\r\nwhich he had come away from Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, on the morning of that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s disaster. At such times, he would keep clear of the\r\nobstacles in his way, mechanically; and would appear to see and hear\r\nnothing until arrival at his destination, or some sudden chance or\r\neffort roused him.\r\n\r\nWalking his white-legged horse thus, to the counting-house of Dombey\r\nand Son one day, he was as unconscious of the observation of two pairs\r\nof women\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as of the fascinated orbs of Rob the Grinder, who, in\r\nwaiting a street\xe2\x80\x99s length from the appointed place, as a demonstration\r\nof punctuality, vainly touched and retouched his hat to attract\r\nattention, and trotted along on foot, by his master\xe2\x80\x99s side, prepared to\r\nhold his stirrup when he should alight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee where he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of these two women, an old creature, who\r\nstretched out her shrivelled arm to point him out to her companion, a\r\nyoung woman, who stood close beside her, withdrawn like herself into a\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\nMrs Brown\xe2\x80\x99s daughter looked out, at this bidding on the part of Mrs\r\nBrown; and there were wrath and vengeance in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought to look at him again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s well I should, perhaps. I see. I see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot changed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, with a look of eager malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe changed!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? What has he suffered?\r\nThere is change enough for twenty in me. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee where he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old woman, watching her daughter with\r\nher red eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cso easy and so trim a-horseback, while we are in the\r\nmud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said her daughter impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are mud, underneath his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s feet. What should we be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the intentness with which she looked after him again, she made a\r\nhasty gesture with her hand when the old woman began to reply, as if\r\nher view could be obstructed by mere sound. Her mother watching her,\r\nand not him, remained silent; until her kindling glance subsided, and\r\nshe drew a long breath, as if in the relief of his being gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeary!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman then. \xe2\x80\x9cAlice! Handsome gall Ally!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ngently shook her sleeve to arouse her attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you let him go\r\nlike that, when you can wring money from him? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wickedness,\r\nmy daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you, that I will not have money from him?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreturned. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you yet believe me? Did I take his sister\xe2\x80\x99s money?\r\nWould I touch a penny, if I knew it, that had gone through his white\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94unless it was, indeed, that I could poison it, and send it back\r\nto him? Peace, mother, and come away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd him so rich?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd us so poor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor in not being able to pay him any of the harm we owe him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him give me that sort of riches, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake them from him, and use them. Come away. Its no good looking at his\r\nhorse. Come away, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old woman, for whom the spectacle of Rob the Grinder returning\r\ndown the street, leading the riderless horse, appeared to have some\r\nextraneous interest that it did not possess in itself, surveyed that\r\nyoung man with the utmost earnestness; and seeming to have whatever\r\ndoubts she entertained, resolved as he drew nearer, glanced at her\r\ndaughter with brightened eyes and with her finger on her lip, and\r\nemerging from the gateway at the moment of his passing, touched him on\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where\xe2\x80\x99s my sprightly Rob been, all this time!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he\r\nturned round.\r\n\r\nThe sprightly Rob, whose sprightliness was very much diminished by the\r\nsalutation, looked exceedingly dismayed, and said, with the water\r\nrising in his eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! why can\xe2\x80\x99t you leave a poor cove alone, Misses Brown, when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting an honest livelihood and conducting himself respectable? What\r\ndo you come and deprive a cove of his character for, by talking to him\r\nin the streets, when he\xe2\x80\x99s taking his master\xe2\x80\x99s horse to a honest\r\nstable\xe2\x80\x94a horse you\xe2\x80\x99d go and sell for cats\xe2\x80\x99 and dogs\xe2\x80\x99 meat if you had\r\nyour way! Why, I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, producing his concluding\r\nremark as if it were the climax of all his injuries, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you was dead\r\nlong ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, appealing to her daughter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he talks to me, who knew him weeks and months together, my deary,\r\nand have stood his friend many and many a time among the\r\npigeon-fancying tramps and bird-catchers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the birds be, will you, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Rob, in a tone of\r\nthe acutest anguish. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a cove had better have to do with lions\r\nthan them little creeturs, for they\xe2\x80\x99re always flying back in your face\r\nwhen you least expect it. Well, how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do and what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese polite inquiries the Grinder uttered, as it were under protest,\r\nand with great exasperation and vindictiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark how he speaks to an old friend, my deary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, again\r\nappealing to her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s some of his old friends not so\r\npatient as me. If I was to tell some that he knows, and has spotted and\r\ncheated with, where to find him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hold your tongue, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the miserable\r\nGrinder, glancing quickly round, as though he expected to see his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s teeth shining at his elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you take a pleasure in\r\nruining a cove for? At your time of life too! when you ought to be\r\nthinking of a variety of things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a gallant horse!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, patting the animal\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone, will you, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, pushing away her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re enough to drive a penitent cove mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what hurt do I do him, child?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a master that would find it out if he was\r\ntouched with a straw.\xe2\x80\x9d And he blew upon the place where the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand had rested for a moment, and smoothed it gently with his finger,\r\nas if he seriously believed what he said.\r\n\r\nThe old woman looking back to mumble and mouth at her daughter, who\r\nfollowed, kept close to Rob\xe2\x80\x99s heels as he walked on with the bridle in\r\nhis hand; and pursued the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good place, Rob, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in luck, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about luck, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the wretched\r\nGrinder, facing round and stopping. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99d never come, or if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngo away, then indeed a cove might be considered tolerable lucky. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou go along, Misses Brown, and not foller me!\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered Rob, with\r\nsudden defiance. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of yours, why don\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\ntake you away, instead of letting you make yourself so disgraceful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the old woman, putting her face close to his, with a\r\nmalevolent grin upon it that puckered up the loose skin down in her\r\nvery throat. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you deny your old chum! Have you lurked to my house\r\nfifty times, and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but\r\nthe paving-stones, and do you talk to me like this! Have I bought and\r\nsold with you, and helped you in my way of business, schoolboy, sneak,\r\nand what not, and do you tell me to go along? Could I raise a crowd of\r\nold company about you to-morrow morning, that would follow you to ruin\r\nlike copies of your own shadow, and do you turn on me with your bold\r\nlooks! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Come, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the distracted Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing\r\nof? Don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself in a passion! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her go, if you please. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t meant any offence. I said \xe2\x80\x98how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do,\xe2\x80\x99 at first, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\r\nBut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. How you do? Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob piteously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clook here! How can a cove stand talking in the street with his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s prad a-wanting to be took to be rubbed down, and his master up\r\nto every individgle thing that happens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman made a show of being partially appeased, but shook her\r\nhead, and mouthed and muttered still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along to the stables, and have a glass of something that\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nfor you, Misses Brown, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of going on, like\r\nthat, which is no good to you, nor anybody else. Come along with her,\r\nwill you be so kind?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to see her, if\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for the horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this apology, Rob turned away, a rueful picture of despair, and\r\nwalked his charge down a bye street. The old woman, mouthing at her\r\ndaughter, followed close upon him. The daughter followed.\r\n\r\nTurning into a silent little square or court-yard that had a great\r\nchurch tower rising above it, and a packer\xe2\x80\x99s warehouse, and a\r\nbottle-maker\xe2\x80\x99s warehouse, for its places of business, Rob the Grinder\r\ndelivered the white-legged horse to the hostler of a quaint stable at\r\nthe corner; and inviting Mrs Brown and her daughter to seat themselves\r\nupon a stone bench at the gate of that establishment, soon reappeared\r\nfrom a neighbouring public-house with a pewter measure and a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s master\xe2\x80\x94Mr Carker, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, slowly, as her\r\nsentiment before drinking. \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you who he was,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Rob, with staring eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know him by sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, whose working mouth and nodding\r\nhead stopped for the moment, in the fixedness of her attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw\r\nhim pass this morning, afore he got off his horse; when you were ready\r\nto take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, appearing to wish that his readiness had\r\ncarried him to any other place.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her? Won\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\ndrink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis inquiry had reference to Alice, who, folded in her cloak, sat a\r\nlittle apart, profoundly inattentive to his offer of the replenished\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe old woman shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nstrange creetur, if you know\xe2\x80\x99d her, Rob. But Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, glancing cautiously up at the packer\xe2\x80\x99s, and at the\r\nbottle-maker\xe2\x80\x99s, as if, from any one of the tiers of warehouses, Mr\r\nCarker might be looking down. \xe2\x80\x9cSoftly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t here!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Rob, whose glance even wandered to the\r\nchurch tower, as if he might be there, with a supernatural power of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood master?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\nRob nodded; and added, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cprecious sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLives out of town, don\xe2\x80\x99t he, lovey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he\xe2\x80\x99s at home,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we don\xe2\x80\x99t live at home just\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLodgings; up near Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob.\r\n\r\nThe younger woman fixed her eyes so searchingly upon him, and so\r\nsuddenly, that Rob was quite confounded, and offered the glass again,\r\nbut with no more effect upon her than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94you and I used to talk about him, sometimes, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob to Mrs Brown. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used to get me to talk about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Dombey, he\xe2\x80\x99s had a fall from his horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob,\r\nunwillingly; \xe2\x80\x9cand my master has to be up there, more than usual, either\r\nwith him, or Mrs Dombey, or some of \xe2\x80\x99em; and so we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they good friends, lovey?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Mr and Mrs Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot them\xe2\x80\x94Master and Mrs Dombey, chick,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman,\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, looking round him again. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so. How\r\ncurious you are, Misses Brown! Least said, soonest mended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old woman, with a laugh, and\r\na clap of her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cSprightly Rob, has grown tame since he has been\r\nwell off! There\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in it, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, with the same\r\ndistrustful glance at the packer\xe2\x80\x99s and the bottle-maker\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\nchurch; \xe2\x80\x9cbut blabbing, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only about the number of buttons on my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s coat, won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I tell you it won\xe2\x80\x99t do with him. A cove had\r\nbetter drown himself. He says so. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have so much as told you\r\nwhat his name was, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t known it. Talk about somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Rob took another cautious survey of the yard, the old woman made a\r\nsecret motion to her daughter. It was momentary, but the daughter, with\r\na slight look of intelligence, withdrew her eyes from the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nand sat folded in her cloak as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob, lovey!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, beckoning him to the other end of the\r\nbench. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were always a pet and favourite of mine. Now, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know you were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Grinder, with a very bad grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you could leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, flinging her arms about\r\nhis neck. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could go away, and grow almost out of knowledge, and\r\nnever come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were, proud\r\nlad! Oho, Oho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh here\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful go for a cove that\xe2\x80\x99s got a master wide awake in\r\nthe neighbourhood!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the wretched Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be howled over\r\nlike this here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come and see me, Robby?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Brown. \xe2\x80\x9cOho, won\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\never come and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I tell you! Yes, I will!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my own Rob! That\xe2\x80\x99s my lovey!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, drying the tears\r\nupon her shrivelled face, and giving him a tender squeeze. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the old\r\nplace, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon, Robby dear?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Brown; \xe2\x80\x9cand often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Yes. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cI will indeed, upon my soul and body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, with her arms uplifted towards the sky, and\r\nher head thrown back and shaking, \xe2\x80\x9cif he\xe2\x80\x99s true to his word, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ncome a-near him though I know where he is, and never breathe a syllable\r\nabout him! Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ejaculation seemed a drop of comfort to the miserable Grinder, who\r\nshook Mrs Brown by the hand upon it, and implored her with tears in his\r\neyes, to leave a cove and not destroy his prospects. Mrs Brown, with\r\nanother fond embrace, assented; but in the act of following her\r\ndaughter, turned back, with her finger stealthily raised, and asked in\r\na hoarse whisper for some money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shilling, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her eager avaricious face, \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nsixpence! For old acquaintance sake. I\xe2\x80\x99m so poor. And my handsome\r\ngal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94looking over her shoulder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s my gal, Rob\xe2\x80\x94half starves me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as the reluctant Grinder put it in her hand, her daughter, coming\r\nquietly back, caught the hand in hers, and twisted out the coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmother! always money! money from the first, and to\r\nthe last. Do you mind so little what I said but now? Here. Take it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman uttered a moan as the money was restored, but without in\r\nany other way opposing its restoration, hobbled at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\nout of the yard, and along the by-street upon which it opened. The\r\nastonished and dismayed Rob staring after them, saw that they stopped,\r\nand fell to earnest conversation very soon; and more than once observed\r\na darkly threatening action of the younger woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand (obviously\r\nhaving reference to someone of whom they spoke), and a crooning feeble\r\nimitation of it on the part of Mrs Brown, that made him earnestly hope\r\nhe might not be the subject of their discourse.\r\n\r\nWith the present consolation that they were gone, and with the\r\nprospective comfort that Mrs Brown could not live for ever, and was not\r\nlikely to live long to trouble him, the Grinder, not otherwise\r\nregretting his misdeeds than as they were attended with such\r\ndisagreeable incidental consequences, composed his ruffled features to\r\na more serene expression by thinking of the admirable manner in which\r\nhe had disposed of Captain Cuttle (a reflection that seldom failed to\r\nput him in a flow of spirits), and went to the Dombey Counting House to\r\nreceive his master\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\r\n\r\nThere his master, so subtle and vigilant of eye, that Rob quaked before\r\nhim, more than half expecting to be taxed with Mrs Brown, gave him the\r\nusual morning\xe2\x80\x99s box of papers for Mr Dombey, and a note for Mrs Dombey:\r\nmerely nodding his head as an enjoinder to be careful, and to use\r\ndispatch\xe2\x80\x94a mysterious admonition, fraught in the Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\r\nwith dismal warnings and threats; and more powerful with him than any\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAlone again, in his own room, Mr Carker applied himself to work, and\r\nworked all day. He saw many visitors; overlooked a number of documents;\r\nwent in and out, to and from, sundry places of mercantile resort; and\r\nindulged in no more abstraction until the day\xe2\x80\x99s business was done. But,\r\nwhen the usual clearance of papers from his table was made at last, he\r\nfell into his thoughtful mood once more.\r\n\r\nHe was standing in his accustomed place and attitude, with his eyes\r\nintently fixed upon the ground, when his brother entered to bring back\r\nsome letters that had been taken out in the course of the day. He put\r\nthem quietly on the table, and was going immediately, when Mr Carker\r\nthe Manager, whose eyes had rested on him, on his entrance, as if they\r\nhad all this time had him for the subject of their contemplation,\r\ninstead of the office-floor, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, John Carker, and what brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis brother pointed to the letters, and was again withdrawing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you can come and go, without\r\ninquiring how our master is\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had word this morning in the Counting House, that Mr Dombey was\r\ndoing well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are such a meek fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, with a smile,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nhave grown so, in the course of years\xe2\x80\x94that if any harm came to him,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d be miserable, I dare swear now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be truly sorry, James,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, pointing at him, as if there\r\nwere some other person present to whom he was appealing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would be\r\ntruly sorry! This brother of mine! This junior of the place, this\r\nslighted piece of lumber, pushed aside with his face to the wall, like\r\na rotten picture, and left so, for Heaven knows how many years he\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\ngratitude and respect, and devotion too, he would have me believe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have you believe nothing, James,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cBe as\r\njust to me as you would to any other man below you. You ask a question,\r\nand I answer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you nothing, Spaniel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, with unusual\r\nirascibility, \xe2\x80\x9cto complain of in him? No proud treatment to resent, no\r\ninsolence, no foolery of state, no exaction of any sort! What the\r\ndevil! are you man or mouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be strange if any two persons could be together for so many\r\nyears, especially as superior and inferior, without each having\r\nsomething to complain of in the other\xe2\x80\x94as he thought, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied John Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut apart from my history here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis history here!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there it is. The very\r\nfact that makes him an extreme case, puts him out of the whole chapter!\r\nWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from that, which, as you hint, gives me a reason to be thankful\r\nthat I alone (happily for all the rest) possess, surely there is no one\r\nin the House who would not say and feel at least as much. You do not\r\nthink that anybody here would be indifferent to a mischance or\r\nmisfortune happening to the head of the House, or anything than truly\r\nsorry for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have good reason to be bound to him too!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager,\r\ncontemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe that you are kept here, as a\r\ncheap example, and a famous instance of the clemency of Dombey and Son,\r\nredounding to the credit of the illustrious House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his brother, mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have long believed that I am kept\r\nhere for more kind and disinterested reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you were going,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, with the snarl of a tiger-cat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto recite some Christian precept, I observed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, James,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthough the tie of brotherhood\r\nbetween us has been long broken and thrown away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho broke it, good Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, by my misconduct. I do not charge it upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Manager replied, with that mute action of his bristling mouth, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t charge it upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d and bade him go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, though there is not that tie between us, do not, I entreat,\r\nassail me with unnecessary taunts, or misinterpret what I say, or would\r\nsay. I was only going to suggest to you that it would be a mistake to\r\nsuppose that it is only you, who have been selected here, above all\r\nothers, for advancement, confidence and distinction (selected, in the\r\nbeginning, I know, for your great ability and trustfulness), and who\r\ncommunicate more freely with Mr Dombey than anyone, and stand, it may\r\nbe said, on equal terms with him, and have been favoured and enriched\r\nby him\xe2\x80\x94that it would be a mistake to suppose that it is only you who\r\nare tender of his welfare and reputation. There is no one in the House,\r\nfrom yourself down to the lowest, I sincerely believe, who does not\r\nparticipate in that feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, red with sudden anger. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nhypocrite, John Carker, and you lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, flushing in his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\nthese insulting words? Why do you so basely use them to me,\r\nunprovoked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your hypocrisy and meekness\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nall the hypocrisy and meekness of this place\xe2\x80\x94is not worth that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsnapping his thumb and finger, \xe2\x80\x9cand that I see through it as if it were\r\nair! There is not a man employed here, standing between myself and the\r\nlowest in place (of whom you are very considerate, and with reason, for\r\nhe is not far off), who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be glad at heart to see his master\r\nhumbled: who does not hate him, secretly: who does not wish him evil\r\nrather than good: and who would not turn upon him, if he had the power\r\nand boldness. The nearer to his favour, the nearer to his insolence;\r\nthe closer to him, the farther from him. That\xe2\x80\x99s the creed here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother, whose roused feelings had soon\r\nyielded to surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cwho may have abused your ear with such\r\nrepresentations; or why you have chosen to try me, rather than another.\r\nBut that you have been trying me, and tampering with me, I am now sure.\r\nYou have a different manner and a different aspect from any that I ever\r\nsaw in you. I will only say to you, once more, you are deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI have told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cBy your informant, if you have one.\r\nIf not, by your own thoughts and suspicions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no suspicions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Manager. \xe2\x80\x9cMine are certainties. You\r\npusillanimous, abject, cringing dogs! All making the same show, all\r\ncanting the same story, all whining the same professions, all\r\nharbouring the same transparent secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis brother withdrew, without saying more, and shut the door as he\r\nconcluded. Mr Carker the Manager drew a chair close before the fire,\r\nand fell to beating the coals softly with the poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe faint-hearted, fawning knaves,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, with his two shining\r\nrows of teeth laid bare. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not one among them, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeign to be so shocked and outraged\xe2\x80\x94! Bah! There\xe2\x80\x99s not one among them,\r\nbut if he had at once the power, and the wit and daring to use it,\r\nwould scatter Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s pride and lay it low, as ruthlessly as I rake\r\nout these ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he broke them up and strewed them in the grate, he looked on with a\r\nthoughtful smile at what he was doing. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout the same queen beckoner\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d he added presently; \xe2\x80\x9cand there is pride there, not to be\r\nforgotten\xe2\x80\x94witness our own acquaintance!\xe2\x80\x9d With that he fell into a\r\ndeeper reverie, and sat pondering over the blackening grate, until he\r\nrose up like a man who had been absorbed in a book, and looking round\r\nhim took his hat and gloves, went to where his horse was waiting,\r\nmounted, and rode away through the lighted streets, for it was evening.\r\n\r\nHe rode near Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s house; and falling into a walk as he\r\napproached it, looked up at the windows The window where he had once\r\nseen Florence sitting with her dog attracted his attention first,\r\nthough there was no light in it; but he smiled as he carried his eyes\r\nup the tall front of the house, and seemed to leave that object\r\nsuperciliously behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime was,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it was well to watch even your rising little\r\nstar, and know in what quarter there were clouds, to shadow you if\r\nneedful. But a planet has arisen, and you are lost in its light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned the white-legged horse round the street corner, and sought\r\none shining window from among those at the back of the house.\r\nAssociated with it was a certain stately presence, a gloved hand, the\r\nremembrance how the feathers of a beautiful bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing had been\r\nshowered down upon the floor, and how the light white down upon a robe\r\nhad stirred and rustled, as in the rising of a distant storm. These\r\nwere the things he carried with him as he turned away again, and rode\r\nthrough the darkening and deserted Parks at a quick rate.\r\n\r\nIn fatal truth, these were associated with a woman, a proud woman, who\r\nhated him, but who by slow and sure degrees had been led on by his\r\ncraft, and her pride and resentment, to endure his company, and little\r\nby little to receive him as one who had the privilege to talk to her of\r\nher own defiant disregard of her own husband, and her abandonment of\r\nhigh consideration for herself. They were associated with a woman who\r\nhated him deeply, and who knew him, and who mistrusted him because she\r\nknew him, and because he knew her; but who fed her fierce resentment by\r\nsuffering him to draw nearer and yet nearer to her every day, in spite\r\nof the hate she cherished for him. In spite of it! For that very\r\nreason; since in its depths, too far down for her threatening eye to\r\npierce, though she could see into them dimly, lay the dark retaliation,\r\nwhose faintest shadow seen once and shuddered at, and never seen again,\r\nwould have been sufficient stain upon her soul.\r\n\r\nDid the phantom of such a woman flit about him on his ride; true to the\r\nreality, and obvious to him?\r\n\r\nYes. He saw her in his mind, exactly as she was. She bore him company\r\nwith her pride, resentment, hatred, all as plain to him as her beauty;\r\nwith nothing plainer to him than her hatred of him. He saw her\r\nsometimes haughty and repellent at his side, and some times down among\r\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, fallen and in the dust. But he always saw her as she\r\nwas, without disguise, and watched her on the dangerous way that she\r\nwas going.\r\n\r\nAnd when his ride was over, and he was newly dressed, and came into the\r\nlight of her bright room with his bent head, soft voice, and soothing\r\nsmile, he saw her yet as plainly. He even suspected the mystery of the\r\ngloved hand, and held it all the longer in his own for that suspicion.\r\nUpon the dangerous way that she was going, he was, still; and not a\r\nfootprint did she mark upon it, but he set his own there, straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nThe Thunderbolt\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barrier between Mr Dombey and his wife was not weakened by time.\r\nIll-assorted couple, unhappy in themselves and in each other, bound\r\ntogether by no tie but the manacle that joined their fettered hands,\r\nand straining that so harshly, in their shrinking asunder, that it wore\r\nand chafed to the bone, Time, consoler of affliction and softener of\r\nanger, could do nothing to help them. Their pride, however different in\r\nkind and object, was equal in degree; and, in their flinty opposition,\r\nstruck out fire between them which might smoulder or might blaze, as\r\ncircumstances were, but burned up everything within their mutual reach,\r\nand made their marriage way a road of ashes.\r\n\r\nLet us be just to him. In the monstrous delusion of his life, swelling\r\nwith every grain of sand that shifted in its glass, he urged her on, he\r\nlittle thought to what, or considered how; but still his feeling\r\ntowards her, such as it was, remained as at first. She had the grand\r\ndemerit of unaccountably putting herself in opposition to the\r\nrecognition of his vast importance, and to the acknowledgment of her\r\ncomplete submission to it, and so far it was necessary to correct and\r\nreduce her; but otherwise he still considered her, in his cold way, a\r\nlady capable of doing honour, if she would, to his choice and name, and\r\nof reflecting credit on his proprietorship.\r\n\r\nNow, she, with all her might of passionate and proud resentment, bent\r\nher dark glance from day to day, and hour to hour\xe2\x80\x94from that night in\r\nher own chamber, when she had sat gazing at the shadows on the wall, to\r\nthe deeper night fast coming\xe2\x80\x94upon one figure directing a crowd of\r\nhumiliations and exasperations against her; and that figure, still her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nWas Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s master-vice, that ruled him so inexorably, an unnatural\r\ncharacteristic? It might be worthwhile, sometimes, to inquire what\r\nNature is, and how men work to change her, and whether, in the enforced\r\ndistortions so produced, it is not natural to be unnatural. Coop any\r\nson or daughter of our mighty mother within narrow range, and bind the\r\nprisoner to one idea, and foster it by servile worship of it on the\r\npart of the few timid or designing people standing round, and what is\r\nNature to the willing captive who has never risen up upon the wings of\r\na free mind\xe2\x80\x94drooping and useless soon\xe2\x80\x94to see her in her comprehensive\r\ntruth!\r\n\r\nAlas! are there so few things in the world, about us, most unnatural,\r\nand yet most natural in being so? Hear the magistrate or judge admonish\r\nthe unnatural outcasts of society; unnatural in brutal habits,\r\nunnatural in want of decency, unnatural in losing and confounding all\r\ndistinctions between good and evil; unnatural in ignorance, in vice, in\r\nrecklessness, in contumacy, in mind, in looks, in everything. But\r\nfollow the good clergyman or doctor, who, with his life imperilled at\r\nevery breath he draws, goes down into their dens, lying within the\r\nechoes of our carriage wheels and daily tread upon the pavement stones.\r\nLook round upon the world of odious sights\xe2\x80\x94millions of immortal\r\ncreatures have no other world on earth\xe2\x80\x94at the lightest mention of which\r\nhumanity revolts, and dainty delicacy living in the next street, stops\r\nher ears, and lisps \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d Breathe the polluted air,\r\nfoul with every impurity that is poisonous to health and life; and have\r\nevery sense, conferred upon our race for its delight and happiness,\r\noffended, sickened and disgusted, and made a channel by which misery\r\nand death alone can enter. Vainly attempt to think of any simple plant,\r\nor flower, or wholesome weed, that, set in this foetid bed, could have\r\nits natural growth, or put its little leaves off to the sun as GOD\r\ndesigned it. And then, calling up some ghastly child, with stunted form\r\nand wicked face, hold forth on its unnatural sinfulness, and lament its\r\nbeing, so early, far away from Heaven\xe2\x80\x94but think a little of its having\r\nbeen conceived, and born and bred, in Hell!\r\n\r\nThose who study the physical sciences, and bring them to bear upon the\r\nhealth of Man, tell us that if the noxious particles that rise from\r\nvitiated air were palpable to the sight, we should see them lowering in\r\na dense black cloud above such haunts, and rolling slowly on to corrupt\r\nthe better portions of a town. But if the moral pestilence that rises\r\nwith them, and in the eternal laws of our Nature, is inseparable from\r\nthem, could be made discernible too, how terrible the revelation! Then\r\nshould we see depravity, impiety, drunkenness, theft, murder, and a\r\nlong train of nameless sins against the natural affections and\r\nrepulsions of mankind, overhanging the devoted spots, and creeping on,\r\nto blight the innocent and spread contagion among the pure. Then should\r\nwe see how the same poisoned fountains that flow into our hospitals and\r\nlazar-houses, inundate the jails, and make the convict-ships swim deep,\r\nand roll across the seas, and over-run vast continents with crime. Then\r\nshould we stand appalled to know, that where we generate disease to\r\nstrike our children down and entail itself on unborn generations, there\r\nalso we breed, by the same certain process, infancy that knows no\r\ninnocence, youth without modesty or shame, maturity that is mature in\r\nnothing but in suffering and guilt, blasted old age that is a scandal\r\non the form we bear, unnatural humanity! When we shall gather grapes\r\nfrom thorns, and figs from thistles; when fields of grain shall spring\r\nup from the offal in the bye-ways of our wicked cities, and roses bloom\r\nin the fat churchyards that they cherish; then we may look for natural\r\nhumanity, and find it growing from such seed.\r\n\r\nOh for a good spirit who would take the house-tops off, with a more\r\npotent and benignant hand than the lame demon in the tale, and show a\r\nChristian people what dark shapes issue from amidst their homes, to\r\nswell the retinue of the Destroying Angel as he moves forth among them!\r\nFor only one night\xe2\x80\x99s view of the pale phantoms rising from the scenes\r\nof our too-long neglect; and from the thick and sullen air where Vice\r\nand Fever propagate together, raining the tremendous social\r\nretributions which are ever pouring down, and ever coming thicker!\r\nBright and blest the morning that should rise on such a night: for men,\r\ndelayed no more by stumbling-blocks of their own making, which are but\r\nspecks of dust upon the path between them and eternity, would then\r\napply themselves, like creatures of one common origin, owing one duty\r\nto the Father of one family, and tending to one common end, to make the\r\nworld a better place!\r\n\r\nNot the less bright and blest would that day be for rousing some who\r\nnever have looked out upon the world of human life around them, to a\r\nknowledge of their own relation to it, and for making them acquainted\r\nwith a perversion of nature in their own contracted sympathies and\r\nestimates; as great, and yet as natural in its development when once\r\nbegun, as the lowest degradation known.\r\n\r\nBut no such day had ever dawned on Mr Dombey, or his wife; and the\r\ncourse of each was taken.\r\n\r\nThrough six months that ensued upon his accident, they held the same\r\nrelations one towards the other. A marble rock could not have stood\r\nmore obdurately in his way than she; and no chilled spring, lying\r\nuncheered by any ray of light in the depths of a deep cave, could be\r\nmore sullen or more cold than he.\r\n\r\nThe hope that had fluttered within her when the promise of her new home\r\ndawned, was quite gone from the heart of Florence now. That home was\r\nnearly two years old; and even the patient trust that was in her, could\r\nnot survive the daily blight of such experience. If she had any\r\nlingering fancy in the nature of hope left, that Edith and her father\r\nmight be happier together, in some distant time, she had none, now,\r\nthat her father would ever love her. The little interval in which she\r\nhad imagined that she saw some small relenting in him, was forgotten in\r\nthe long remembrance of his coldness since and before, or only\r\nremembered as a sorrowful delusion.\r\n\r\nFlorence loved him still, but, by degrees, had come to love him rather\r\nas some dear one who had been, or who might have been, than as the hard\r\nreality before her eyes. Something of the softened sadness with which\r\nshe loved the memory of little Paul, or of her mother, seemed to enter\r\nnow into her thoughts of him, and to make them, as it were, a dear\r\nremembrance. Whether it was that he was dead to her, and that partly\r\nfor this reason, partly for his share in those old objects of her\r\naffection, and partly for the long association of him with hopes that\r\nwere withered and tendernesses he had frozen, she could not have told;\r\nbut the father whom she loved began to be a vague and dreamy idea to\r\nher: hardly more substantially connected with her real life, than the\r\nimage she would sometimes conjure up, of her dear brother yet alive,\r\nand growing to be a man, who would protect and cherish her.\r\n\r\nThe change, if it may be called one, had stolen on her like the change\r\nfrom childhood to womanhood, and had come with it. Florence was almost\r\nseventeen, when, in her lonely musings, she was conscious of these\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nShe was often alone now, for the old association between her and her\r\nMama was greatly changed. At the time of her father\xe2\x80\x99s accident, and\r\nwhen he was lying in his room downstairs, Florence had first observed\r\nthat Edith avoided her. Wounded and shocked, and yet unable to\r\nreconcile this with her affection when they did meet, she sought her in\r\nher own room at night, once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, stealing softly to her side, \xe2\x80\x9chave I offended\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith answered \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have done something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it is. You\r\nhave changed your manner to me, dear Mama. I cannot say how instantly I\r\nfeel the least change; for I love you with my whole heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I do you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Florence, believe me never more than\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go away from me so often, and keep away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you sometimes look so strangely on me, dear Mama? You do\r\nso, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith signified assent with her dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me why, that I may know how\r\nto please you better; and tell me this shall not be so any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Edith, taking the hand that embraced her neck,\r\nand looking into the eyes that looked into hers so lovingly, as\r\nFlorence knelt upon the ground before her; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy it is, I cannot tell\r\nyou. It is neither for me to say, nor you to hear; but that it is, and\r\nthat it must be, I know. Should I do it if I did not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we to be estranged, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, gazing at her like one\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nEdith\xe2\x80\x99s silent lips formed \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence looked at her with increasing fear and wonder, until she could\r\nsee her no more through the blinding tears that ran down her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence! my life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to me. I cannot\r\nbear to see this grief. Be calmer. You see that I am composed, and is\r\nit nothing to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe resumed her steady voice and manner as she said the latter words,\r\nand added presently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot wholly estranged. Partially: and only that, in appearance,\r\nFlorence, for in my own breast I am still the same to you, and ever\r\nwill be. But what I do is not done for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for me, Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cto know what it is; why,\r\nmatters little. Dear Florence, it is better\xe2\x80\x94it is necessary\xe2\x80\x94it must\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94that our association should be less frequent. The confidence there\r\nhas been between us must be broken off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mama, when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all time to come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know that. Nor will I\r\nsay that companionship between us is, at the best, an ill-assorted and\r\nunholy union, of which I might have known no good could come. My way\r\nhere has been through paths that you will never tread, and my way\r\nhenceforth may lie\xe2\x80\x94God knows\xe2\x80\x94I do not see it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice died away into silence; and she sat, looking at Florence, and\r\nalmost shrinking from her, with the same strange dread and wild\r\navoidance that Florence had noticed once before. The same dark pride\r\nand rage succeeded, sweeping over her form and features like an angry\r\nchord across the strings of a wild harp. But no softness or humility\r\nensued on that. She did not lay her head down now, and weep, and say\r\nthat she had no hope but in Florence. She held it up as if she were a\r\nbeautiful Medusa, looking on him, face to face, to strike him dead.\r\nYes, and she would have done it, if she had had the charm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a change in you, in more\r\nthan what you say to me, which alarms me. Let me stay with you a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cno, dearest. I am best left alone now, and I do best\r\nto keep apart from you, of all else. Ask me no questions, but believe\r\nthat what I am when I seem fickle or capricious to you, I am not of my\r\nown will, or for myself. Believe, though we are stranger to each other\r\nthan we have been, that I am unchanged to you within. Forgive me for\r\nhaving ever darkened your dark home\xe2\x80\x94I am a shadow on it, I know\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94and let us never speak of this again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not to part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do this that we may not part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk no more. Go,\r\nFlorence! My love and my remorse go with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe embraced her, and dismissed her; and as Florence passed out of her\r\nroom, Edith looked on the retiring figure, as if her good angel went\r\nout in that form, and left her to the haughty and indignant passions\r\nthat now claimed her for their own, and set their seal upon her brow.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour, Florence and she were, as they had been, no more. For\r\ndays together, they would seldom meet, except at table, and when Mr\r\nDombey was present. Then Edith, imperious, inflexible, and silent,\r\nnever looked at her. Whenever Mr Carker was of the party, as he often\r\nwas, during the progress of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, and afterwards, Edith\r\nheld herself more removed from her, and was more distant towards her,\r\nthan at other times. Yet she and Florence never encountered, when there\r\nwas no one by, but she would embrace her as affectionately as of old,\r\nthough not with the same relenting of her proud aspect; and often, when\r\nshe had been out late, she would steal up to Florence\xe2\x80\x99s room, as she\r\nhad been used to do, in the dark, and whisper \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d on her\r\npillow. When unconscious, in her slumber, of such visits, Florence\r\nwould sometimes awake, as from a dream of those words, softly spoken,\r\nand would seem to feel the touch of lips upon her face. But less and\r\nless often as the months went on.\r\n\r\nAnd now the void in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s own heart began again, indeed, to make a\r\nsolitude around her. As the image of the father whom she loved had\r\ninsensibly become a mere abstraction, so Edith, following the fate of\r\nall the rest about whom her affections had entwined themselves, was\r\nfleeting, fading, growing paler in the distance, every day. Little by\r\nlittle, she receded from Florence, like the retiring ghost of what she\r\nhad been; little by little, the chasm between them widened and seemed\r\ndeeper; little by little, all the power of earnestness and tenderness\r\nshe had shown, was frozen up in the bold, angry hardihood with which\r\nshe stood, upon the brink of a deep precipice unseen by Florence,\r\ndaring to look down.\r\n\r\nThere was but one consideration to set against the heavy loss of Edith,\r\nand though it was slight comfort to her burdened heart, she tried to\r\nthink it some relief. No longer divided between her affection and duty\r\nto the two, Florence could love both and do no injustice to either. As\r\nshadows of her fond imagination, she could give them equal place in her\r\nown bosom, and wrong them with no doubts.\r\n\r\nSo she tried to do. At times, and often too, wondering speculations on\r\nthe cause of this change in Edith, would obtrude themselves upon her\r\nmind and frighten her; but in the calm of its abandonment once more to\r\nsilent grief and loneliness, it was not a curious mind. Florence had\r\nonly to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general\r\ngloom that hung upon the house, and to weep and be resigned.\r\n\r\nThus living, in a dream wherein the overflowing love of her young heart\r\nexpended itself on airy forms, and in a real world where she had\r\nexperienced little but the rolling back of that strong tide upon\r\nitself, Florence grew to be seventeen. Timid and retiring as her\r\nsolitary life had made her, it had not embittered her sweet temper, or\r\nher earnest nature. A child in innocent simplicity; a woman in her\r\nmodest self-reliance, and her deep intensity of feeling; both child and\r\nwoman seemed at once expressed in her face and fragile delicacy of\r\nshape, and gracefully to mingle there;\xe2\x80\x94as if the spring should be\r\nunwilling to depart when summer came, and sought to blend the earlier\r\nbeauties of the flowers with their bloom. But in her thrilling voice,\r\nin her calm eyes, sometimes in a sage ethereal light that seemed to\r\nrest upon her head, and always in a certain pensive air upon her\r\nbeauty, there was an expression, such as had been seen in the dead boy;\r\nand the council in the Servants\xe2\x80\x99 Hall whispered so among themselves,\r\nand shook their heads, and ate and drank the more, in a closer bond of\r\ngood-fellowship.\r\n\r\nThis observant body had plenty to say of Mr and Mrs Dombey, and of Mr\r\nCarker, who appeared to be a mediator between them, and who came and\r\nwent as if he were trying to make peace, but never could. They all\r\ndeplored the uncomfortable state of affairs, and all agreed that Mrs\r\nPipchin (whose unpopularity was not to be surpassed) had some hand in\r\nit; but, upon the whole, it was agreeable to have so good a subject for\r\na rallying point, and they made a great deal of it, and enjoyed\r\nthemselves very much.\r\n\r\nThe general visitors who came to the house, and those among whom Mr and\r\nMrs Dombey visited, thought it a pretty equal match, as to haughtiness,\r\nat all events, and thought nothing more about it. The young lady with\r\nthe back did not appear for some time after Mrs Skewton\xe2\x80\x99s death;\r\nobserving to some particular friends, with her usual engaging little\r\nscream, that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t separate the family from a notion of\r\ntombstones, and horrors of that sort; but when she did come, she saw\r\nnothing wrong, except Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a bunch of gold seals to his\r\nwatch, which shocked her very much, as an exploded superstition. This\r\nyouthful fascinator considered a daughter-in-law objectionable in\r\nprinciple; otherwise, she had nothing to say against Florence, but that\r\nshe sadly wanted \xe2\x80\x9cstyle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which might mean back, perhaps. Many, who only\r\ncame to the house on state occasions, hardly knew who Florence was, and\r\nsaid, going home, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, was that Miss Dombey, in the corner? Very\r\npretty, but a little delicate and thoughtful in appearance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone the less so, certainly, for her life of the last six months.\r\nFlorence took her seat at the dinner-table, on the day before the\r\nsecond anniversary of her father\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Edith (Mrs Skewton had\r\nbeen lying stricken with paralysis when the first came round), with an\r\nuneasiness, amounting to dread. She had no other warrant for it, than\r\nthe occasion, the expression of her father\xe2\x80\x99s face, in the hasty glance\r\nshe caught of it, and the presence of Mr Carker, which, always\r\nunpleasant to her, was more so on this day, than she had ever felt it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEdith was richly dressed, for she and Mr Dombey were engaged in the\r\nevening to some large assembly, and the dinner-hour that day was late.\r\nShe did not appear until they were seated at table, when Mr Carker rose\r\nand led her to her chair. Beautiful and lustrous as she was, there was\r\nthat in her face and air which seemed to separate her hopelessly from\r\nFlorence, and from everyone, for ever more. And yet, for an instant,\r\nFlorence saw a beam of kindness in her eyes, when they were turned on\r\nher, that made the distance to which she had withdrawn herself a\r\ngreater cause of sorrow and regret than ever.\r\n\r\nThere was very little said at dinner. Florence heard her father speak\r\nto Mr Carker sometimes on business matters, and heard him softly reply,\r\nbut she paid little attention to what they said, and only wished the\r\ndinner at an end. When the dessert was placed upon the table, and they\r\nwere left alone, with no servant in attendance, Mr Dombey, who had been\r\nseveral times clearing his throat in a manner that augured no good,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey, you know, I suppose, that I have instructed the\r\nhousekeeper that there will be some company to dinner here to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not dine at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a large party,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr Dombey, with an indifferent assumption\r\nof not having heard her; \xe2\x80\x9cmerely some twelve or fourteen. My sister,\r\nMajor Bagstock, and some others whom you know but slightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not dine at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever doubtful reason I may have, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, still\r\ngoing majestically on, as if she had not spoken, \xe2\x80\x9cto hold the occasion\r\nin very pleasant remembrance just now, there are appearances in these\r\nthings which must be maintained before the world. If you have no\r\nrespect for yourself, Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have none,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Dombey, striking his hand upon the table, \xe2\x80\x9chear me if\r\nyou please. I say, if you have no respect for yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ say I have none,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her; but the face she showed him in return would not have\r\nchanged, if death itself had looked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, turning more quietly to that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nyou have been my medium of communication with Mrs Dombey on former\r\noccasions, and as I choose to preserve the decencies of life, so far as\r\nI am individually concerned, I will trouble you to have the goodness to\r\ninform Mrs Dombey that if she has no respect for herself, I have some\r\nrespect for myself, and therefore insist on my arrangements for\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your sovereign master, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will take leave\r\nto speak to him on this subject by-and-bye, and that I will speak to\r\nhim alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing in possession of the\r\nreason which obliges me to refuse you that privilege, shall be absolved\r\nfrom the delivery of any such message.\xe2\x80\x9d He saw her eyes move, while he\r\nspoke, and followed them with his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour daughter is present, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter will remain present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nFlorence, who had risen, sat down again, hiding her face in her hands,\r\nand trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, Madam\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94began Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\nBut Edith stopped him, in a voice which, although not raised in the\r\nleast, was so clear, emphatic, and distinct, that it might have been\r\nheard in a whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I will speak to you alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not mad,\r\nheed what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have authority to speak to you, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nand where I please; and it is my pleasure to speak here and now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose up as if to leave the room; but sat down again, and looking at\r\nhim with all outward composure, said, in the same voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you first, that there is a threatening appearance in your\r\nmanner, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich does not become you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed. The shaken diamonds in her hair started and trembled.\r\nThere are fables of precious stones that would turn pale, their wearer\r\nbeing in danger. Had these been such, their imprisoned rays of light\r\nwould have taken flight that moment, and they would have been as dull\r\nas lead.\r\n\r\nCarker listened, with his eyes cast down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to my daughter, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, resuming the thread of his\r\ndiscourse, \xe2\x80\x9cit is by no means inconsistent with her duty to me, that\r\nshe should know what conduct to avoid. At present you are a very strong\r\nexample to her of this kind, and I hope she may profit by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not stop you now,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his wife, immoveable in eye, and\r\nvoice, and attitude; \xe2\x80\x9cI would not rise and go away, and save you the\r\nutterance of one word, if the room were burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey moved his head, as if in a sarcastic acknowledgment of the\r\nattention, and resumed. But not with so much self-possession as before;\r\nfor Edith\xe2\x80\x99s quick uneasiness in reference to Florence, and Edith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference to him and his censure, chafed and galled him like a\r\nstiffening wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit may not be inconsistent with my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimprovement to know how very much to be lamented, and how necessary to\r\nbe corrected, a stubborn disposition is, especially when it is indulged\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94unthankfully indulged in, I will add\xe2\x80\x94after the gratification of\r\nambition and interest. Both of which, I believe, had some share in\r\ninducing you to occupy your present station at this board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I would not rise, and go away, and save you the utterance of one\r\nword,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, exactly as before, \xe2\x80\x9cif the room were burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be natural enough, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should be\r\nuneasy in the presence of any auditors of these disagreeable truths;\r\nthough why\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he could not hide his real feeling here, or keep his eyes\r\nfrom glancing gloomily at Florence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy anyone can give them greater\r\nforce and point than myself, whom they so nearly concern, I do not\r\npretend to understand. It may be natural enough that you should object\r\nto hear, in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s presence, that there is a rebellious principle\r\nwithin you which you cannot curb too soon; which you must curb, Mrs\r\nDombey; and which, I regret to say, I remember to have seen\r\nmanifested\xe2\x80\x94with some doubt and displeasure, on more than one occasion\r\nbefore our marriage\xe2\x80\x94towards your deceased mother. But you have the\r\nremedy in your own hands. I by no means forgot, when I began, that my\r\ndaughter was present, Mrs Dombey. I beg you will not forget, to-morrow,\r\nthat there are several persons present; and that, with some regard to\r\nappearances, you will receive your company in a becoming manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is not enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you know what has passed\r\nbetween yourself and me; it is not enough that you can look here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npointing at Carker, who still listened, with his eyes cast down, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nbe reminded of the affronts you have put upon me; it is not enough that\r\nyou can look here,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to Florence with a hand that slightly\r\ntrembled for the first and only time, \xe2\x80\x9cand think of what you have done,\r\nand of the ingenious agony, daily, hourly, constant, you have made me\r\nfeel in doing it; it is not enough that this day, of all others in the\r\nyear, is memorable to me for a struggle (well-deserved, but not\r\nconceivable by such as you) in which I wish I had died! You add to all\r\nthis, do you, the last crowning meanness of making her a witness of the\r\ndepth to which I have fallen; when you know that you have made me\r\nsacrifice to her peace, the only gentle feeling and interest of my\r\nlife, when you know that for her sake, I would now if I could\xe2\x80\x94but I can\r\nnot, my soul recoils from you too much\xe2\x80\x94submit myself wholly to your\r\nwill, and be the meekest vassal that you have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not the way to minister to Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s greatness. The old\r\nfeeling was roused by what she said, into a stronger and fiercer\r\nexistence than it had ever had. Again, his neglected child, at this\r\nrough passage of his life, put forth by even this rebellious woman, as\r\npowerful where he was powerless, and everything where he was nothing!\r\n\r\nHe turned on Florence, as if it were she who had spoken, and bade her\r\nleave the room. Florence with her covered face obeyed, trembling and\r\nweeping as she went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, with an angry flush of triumph,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe spirit of opposition that turned your affections in that channel,\r\nbut they have been met, Mrs Dombey; they have been met, and turned\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with her voice and manner still\r\nunchanged. \xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d for he turned sharply when she said so, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the\r\nworse for me, is twenty million times the worse for you. Heed that, if\r\nyou heed nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe arch of diamonds spanning her dark hair, flashed and glittered like\r\na starry bridge. There was no warning in them, or they would have\r\nturned as dull and dim as tarnished honour. Carker still sat and\r\nlistened, with his eyes cast down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, resuming as much as he could of his\r\narrogant composure, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not conciliate me, or turn me from any\r\npurpose, by this course of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only true although it is a faint expression of what is\r\nwithin me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if I thought it would conciliate you, I\r\nwould repress it, if it were repressible by any human effort. I will do\r\nnothing that you ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not accustomed to ask, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed; \xe2\x80\x9cI direct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will hold no place in your house to-morrow, or on any recurrence of\r\nto-morrow. I will be exhibited to no one, as the refractory slave you\r\npurchased, such a time. If I kept my marriage day, I would keep it as a\r\nday of shame. Self-respect! appearances before the world! what are\r\nthese to me? You have done all you can to make them nothing to me, and\r\nthey are nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey, speaking with knitted brows, and after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey is so forgetful of herself and me\r\nin all this, and places me in a position so unsuited to my character,\r\nthat I must bring this state of matters to a close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelease me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, immoveable in voice, in look, and\r\nbearing, as she had been throughout, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the chain by which I am\r\nbound. Let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoose me. Set me free!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, addressing her proud face to Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nwish for a separation between us. That there had better be one. That I\r\nrecommend it to him. Tell him it may take place on his own terms\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nwealth is nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94but that it cannot be too soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven, Mrs Dombey!\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, with supreme amazement,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you imagine it possible that I could ever listen to such a\r\nproposition? Do you know who I am, Madam? Do you know what I represent?\r\nDid you ever hear of Dombey and Son? People to say that Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94Mr\r\nDombey!\xe2\x80\x94was separated from his wife! Common people to talk of Mr Dombey\r\nand his domestic affairs! Do you seriously think, Mrs Dombey, that I\r\nwould permit my name to be banded about in such connexion? Pooh, pooh,\r\nMadam! Fie for shame! You\xe2\x80\x99re absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dombey absolutely laughed.\r\n\r\nBut not as she did. She had better have been dead than laugh as she\r\ndid, in reply, with her intent look fixed upon him. He had better have\r\nbeen dead, than sitting there, in his magnificence, to hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Madam. There is no possibility of\r\nseparation between you and me, and therefore I the more advise you to\r\nbe awakened to a sense of duty. And, Carker, as I was about to say to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Carker, who had sat and listened all this time, now raised his eyes,\r\nin which there was a bright unusual light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94As I was about to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you,\r\nnow that matters have come to this, to inform Mrs Dombey, that it is\r\nnot the rule of my life to allow myself to be thwarted by\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x94anybody, Carker\xe2\x80\x94or to suffer anybody to be paraded as a\r\nstronger motive for obedience in those who owe obedience to me than I\r\nam my self. The mention that has been made of my daughter, and the use\r\nthat is made of my daughter, in opposition to me, are unnatural.\r\nWhether my daughter is in actual concert with Mrs Dombey, I do not\r\nknow, and do not care; but after what Mrs Dombey has said today, and my\r\ndaughter has heard today, I beg you to make known to Mrs Dombey, that\r\nif she continues to make this house the scene of contention it has\r\nbecome, I shall consider my daughter responsible in some degree, on\r\nthat lady\xe2\x80\x99s own avowal, and shall visit her with my severe displeasure.\r\nMrs Dombey has asked \xe2\x80\x98whether it is not enough,\xe2\x80\x99 that she had done this\r\nand that. You will please to answer no, it is not enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Carker, interposing, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me! painful as my\r\nposition is, at the best, and unusually painful in seeming to entertain\r\na different opinion from you,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI must ask, had\r\nyou not better reconsider the question of a separation. I know how\r\nincompatible it appears with your high public position, and I know how\r\ndetermined you are when you give Mrs Dombey to understand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the light in\r\nhis eyes fell upon her as he separated his words each from each, with\r\nthe distinctness of so many bells\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing but death can ever part\r\nyou. Nothing else. But when you consider that Mrs Dombey, by living in\r\nthis house, and making it as you have said, a scene of contention, not\r\nonly has her part in that contention, but compromises Miss Dombey every\r\nday (for I know how determined you are), will you not relieve her from\r\na continual irritation of spirit, and a continual sense of being unjust\r\nto another, almost intolerable? Does this not seem like\xe2\x80\x94I do not say it\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94sacrificing Mrs Dombey to the preservation of your preeminent and\r\nunassailable position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the light in his eyes fell upon her, as she stood looking at her\r\nhusband: now with an extraordinary and awful smile upon her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarker,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, with a supercilious frown, and in a tone\r\nthat was intended to be final, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mistake your position in offering\r\nadvice to me on such a point, and you mistake me (I am surprised to\r\nfind) in the character of your advice. I have no more to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, with an unusual and indefinable taunt in his\r\nair, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mistook my position, when you honoured me with the\r\nnegotiations in which I have been engaged here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a motion of his\r\nhand towards Mrs Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Sir, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were\r\nemployed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing an inferior person, for the humiliation of Mrs Dombey. I forgot.\r\nOh, yes, it was expressly understood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your\r\npardon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he bent his head to Mr Dombey, with an air of deference that\r\naccorded ill with his words, though they were humbly spoken, he moved\r\nit round towards her, and kept his watching eyes that way.\r\n\r\nShe had better have turned hideous and dropped dead, than have stood up\r\nwith such a smile upon her face, in such a fallen spirit\xe2\x80\x99s majesty of\r\nscorn and beauty. She lifted her hand to the tiara of bright jewels\r\nradiant on her head, and, plucking it off with a force that dragged and\r\nstrained her rich black hair with heedless cruelty, and brought it\r\ntumbling wildly on her shoulders, cast the gems upon the ground. From\r\neach arm, she unclasped a diamond bracelet, flung it down, and trod\r\nupon the glittering heap. Without a word, without a shadow on the fire\r\nof her bright eye, without abatement of her awful smile, she looked on\r\nMr Dombey to the last, in moving to the door; and left him.\r\n\r\nFlorence had heard enough before quitting the room, to know that Edith\r\nloved her yet; that she had suffered for her sake; and that she had\r\nkept her sacrifices quiet, lest they should trouble her peace. She did\r\nnot want to speak to her of this\xe2\x80\x94she could not, remembering to whom she\r\nwas opposed\xe2\x80\x94but she wished, in one silent and affectionate embrace, to\r\nassure her that she felt it all, and thanked her.\r\n\r\nHer father went out alone, that evening, and Florence issuing from her\r\nown chamber soon afterwards, went about the house in search of Edith,\r\nbut unavailingly. She was in her own rooms, where Florence had long\r\nceased to go, and did not dare to venture now, lest she should\r\nunconsciously engender new trouble. Still Florence hoping to meet her\r\nbefore going to bed, changed from room to room, and wandered through\r\nthe house so splendid and so dreary, without remaining anywhere.\r\n\r\nShe was crossing a gallery of communication that opened at some little\r\ndistance on the staircase, and was only lighted on great occasions,\r\nwhen she saw, through the opening, which was an arch, the figure of a\r\nman coming down some few stairs opposite. Instinctively apprehensive of\r\nher father, whom she supposed it was, she stopped, in the dark, gazing\r\nthrough the arch into the light. But it was Mr Carker coming down\r\nalone, and looking over the railing into the hall. No bell was rung to\r\nannounce his departure, and no servant was in attendance. He went down\r\nquietly, opened the door for himself, glided out, and shut it softly\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nHer invincible repugnance to this man, and perhaps the stealthy act of\r\nwatching anyone, which, even under such innocent circumstances, is in a\r\nmanner guilty and oppressive, made Florence shake from head to foot.\r\nHer blood seemed to run cold. As soon as she could\xe2\x80\x94for at first she\r\nfelt an insurmountable dread of moving\xe2\x80\x94she went quickly to her own room\r\nand locked her door; but even then, shut in with her dog beside her,\r\nfelt a chill sensation of horror, as if there were danger brooding\r\nsomewhere near her.\r\n\r\nIt invaded her dreams and disturbed the whole night. Rising in the\r\nmorning, unrefreshed, and with a heavy recollection of the domestic\r\nunhappiness of the preceding day, she sought Edith again in all the\r\nrooms, and did so, from time to time, all the morning. But she remained\r\nin her own chamber, and Florence saw nothing of her. Learning, however,\r\nthat the projected dinner at home was put off, Florence thought it\r\nlikely that she would go out in the evening to fulfil the engagement\r\nshe had spoken of; and resolved to try and meet her, then, upon the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening had set in, she heard, from the room in which she sat\r\non purpose, a footstep on the stairs that she thought to be Edith\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHurrying out, and up towards her room, Florence met her immediately,\r\ncoming down alone.\r\n\r\nWhat was Florence\xe2\x80\x99s affright and wonder when, at sight of her, with her\r\ntearful face, and outstretched arms, Edith recoiled and shrieked!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come near me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep away! Let me go by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me by that name! Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d shrinking back, as Florence moved a step towards her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Florence stood transfixed before the haggard face and staring eyes,\r\nshe noted, as in a dream, that Edith spread her hands over them, and\r\nshuddering through all her form, and crouching down against the wall,\r\ncrawled by her like some lower animal, sprang up, and fled away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFlorence dropped upon the stairs in a swoon; and was found there by Mrs\r\nPipchin, she supposed. She knew nothing more, until she found herself\r\nlying on her own bed, with Mrs Pipchin and some servants standing round\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mama?\xe2\x80\x9d was her first question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey is in his own room, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nbest thing you can do, is to take off your things and go to bed this\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d This was the sagacious woman\xe2\x80\x99s remedy for all complaints,\r\nparticularly lowness of spirits, and inability to sleep; for which\r\noffences, many young victims in the days of the Brighton Castle had\r\nbeen committed to bed at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nWithout promising obedience, but on the plea of desiring to be very\r\nquiet, Florence disengaged herself, as soon as she could, from the\r\nministration of Mrs Pipchin and her attendants. Left alone, she thought\r\nof what had happened on the staircase, at first in doubt of its\r\nreality; then with tears; then with an indescribable and terrible\r\nalarm, like that she had felt the night before.\r\n\r\nShe determined not to go to bed until Edith returned, and if she could\r\nnot speak to her, at least to be sure that she was safe at home. What\r\nindistinct and shadowy dread moved Florence to this resolution, she did\r\nnot know, and did not dare to think. She only knew that until Edith\r\ncame back, there was no repose for her aching head or throbbing heart.\r\n\r\nThe evening deepened into night; midnight came; no Edith.\r\n\r\nFlorence could not read, or rest a moment. She paced her own room,\r\nopened the door and paced the staircase-gallery outside, looked out of\r\nwindow on the night, listened to the wind blowing and the rain falling,\r\nsat down and watched the faces in the fire, got up and watched the moon\r\nflying like a storm-driven ship through the sea of clouds.\r\n\r\nAll the house was gone to bed, except two servants who were waiting the\r\nreturn of their mistress, downstairs.\r\n\r\nOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The carriages that rumbled in the distance, turned away,\r\nor stopped short, or went past; the silence gradually deepened, and was\r\nmore and more rarely broken, save by a rush of wind or sweep of rain.\r\nTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock. No Edith!\r\n\r\nFlorence, more agitated, paced her room; and paced the gallery outside;\r\nand looked out at the night, blurred and wavy with the raindrops on the\r\nglass, and the tears in her own eyes; and looked up at the hurry in the\r\nsky, so different from the repose below, and yet so tranquil and\r\nsolitary. Three o\xe2\x80\x99clock! There was a terror in every ash that dropped\r\nout of the fire. No Edith yet.\r\n\r\nMore and more agitated, Florence paced her room, and paced the gallery,\r\nand looked out at the moon with a new fancy of her likeness to a pale\r\nfugitive hurrying away and hiding her guilty face. Four struck! Five!\r\nNo Edith yet.\r\n\r\nBut now there was some cautious stir in the house; and Florence found\r\nthat Mrs Pipchin had been awakened by one of those who sat up, had\r\nrisen and had gone down to her father\xe2\x80\x99s door. Stealing lower down the\r\nstairs, and observing what passed, she saw her father come out in his\r\nmorning gown, and start when he was told his wife had not come home. He\r\ndispatched a messenger to the stables to inquire whether the coachman\r\nwas there; and while the man was gone, dressed himself very hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThe man came back, in great haste, bringing the coachman with him, who\r\nsaid he had been at home and in bed, since ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He had driven\r\nhis mistress to her old house in Brook Street, where she had been met\r\nby Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFlorence stood upon the very spot where she had seen him coming down.\r\nAgain she shivered with the nameless terror of that sight, and had\r\nhardly steadiness enough to hear and understand what followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who had told him, the man went on to say, that his mistress would not\r\nwant the carriage to go home in; and had dismissed him.\r\n\r\nShe saw her father turn white in the face, and heard him ask in a\r\nquick, trembling voice, for Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s maid. The whole house was\r\nroused; for she was there, in a moment, very pale too, and speaking\r\nincoherently.\r\n\r\nShe said she had dressed her mistress early\xe2\x80\x94full two hours before she\r\nwent out\xe2\x80\x94and had been told, as she often was, that she would not be\r\nwanted at night. She had just come from her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what! what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d Florence heard her father demand like a\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the inner dressing-room was locked and the key gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father seized a candle that was flaming on the ground\xe2\x80\x94someone had\r\nput it down there, and forgotten it\xe2\x80\x94and came running upstairs with such\r\nfury, that Florence, in her fear, had hardly time to fly before him.\r\nShe heard him striking in the door, as she ran on, with her hands\r\nwidely spread, and her hair streaming, and her face like a distracted\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s, back to her own room.\r\n\r\nWhen the door yielded, and he rushed in, what did he see there? No one\r\nknew. But thrown down in a costly mass upon the ground, was every\r\nornament she had had, since she had been his wife; every dress she had\r\nworn; and everything she had possessed. This was the room in which he\r\nhad seen, in yonder mirror, the proud face discard him. This was the\r\nroom in which he had wondered, idly, how these things would look when\r\nhe should see them next!\r\n\r\nHeaping them back into the drawers, and locking them up in a rage of\r\nhaste, he saw some papers on the table. The deed of settlement he had\r\nexecuted on their marriage, and a letter. He read that she was gone. He\r\nread that he was dishonoured. He read that she had fled, upon her\r\nshameful wedding-day, with the man whom he had chosen for her\r\nhumiliation; and he tore out of the room, and out of the house, with a\r\nfrantic idea of finding her yet, at the place to which she had been\r\ntaken, and beating all trace of beauty out of the triumphant face with\r\nhis bare hand.\r\n\r\nFlorence, not knowing what she did, put on a shawl and bonnet, in a\r\ndream of running through the streets until she found Edith, and then\r\nclasping her in her arms, to save and bring her back. But when she\r\nhurried out upon the staircase, and saw the frightened servants going\r\nup and down with lights, and whispering together, and falling away from\r\nher father as he passed down, she awoke to a sense of her own\r\npowerlessness; and hiding in one of the great rooms that had been made\r\ngorgeous for this, felt as if her heart would burst with grief.\r\n\r\nCompassion for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head\r\nagainst the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her. Her constant nature\r\nturned to him in his distress, as fervently and faithfully, as if, in\r\nhis prosperity, he had been the embodiment of that idea which had\r\ngradually become so faint and dim. Although she did not know, otherwise\r\nthan through the suggestions of a shapeless fear, the full extent of\r\nhis calamity, he stood before her, wronged and deserted; and again her\r\nyearning love impelled her to his side.\r\n\r\nHe was not long away; for Florence was yet weeping in the great room\r\nand nourishing these thoughts, when she heard him come back. He ordered\r\nthe servants to set about their ordinary occupations, and went into his\r\nown apartment, where he trod so heavily that she could hear him walking\r\nup and down from end to end.\r\n\r\nYielding at once to the impulse of her affection, timid at all other\r\ntimes, but bold in its truth to him in his adversity, and undaunted by\r\npast repulse, Florence, dressed as she was, hurried downstairs. As she\r\nset her light foot in the hall, he came out of his room. She hastened\r\ntowards him unchecked, with her arms stretched out, and crying \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\ndear, dear Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d as if she would have clasped him round the neck.\r\n\r\nAnd so she would have done. But in his frenzy, he lifted up his cruel\r\narm, and struck her, crosswise, with that heaviness, that she tottered\r\non the marble floor; and as he dealt the blow, he told her what Edith\r\nwas, and bade her follow her, since they had always been in league.\r\n\r\nShe did not sink down at his feet; she did not shut out the sight of\r\nhim with her trembling hands; she did not weep; she did not utter one\r\nword of reproach. But she looked at him, and a cry of desolation issued\r\nfrom her heart. For as she looked, she saw him murdering that fond idea\r\nto which she had held in spite of him. She saw his cruelty, neglect,\r\nand hatred dominant above it, and stamping it down. She saw she had no\r\nfather upon earth, and ran out, orphaned, from his house.\r\n\r\nRan out of his house. A moment, and her hand was on the lock, the cry\r\nwas on her lips, his face was there, made paler by the yellow candles\r\nhastily put down and guttering away, and by the daylight coming in\r\nabove the door. Another moment, and the close darkness of the shut-up\r\nhouse (forgotten to be opened, though it was long since day) yielded to\r\nthe unexpected glare and freedom of the morning; and Florence, with her\r\nhead bent down to hide her agony of tears, was in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nThe Flight of Florence\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the wildness of her sorrow, shame, and terror, the forlorn girl\r\nhurried through the sunshine of a bright morning, as if it were the\r\ndarkness of a winter night. Wringing her hands and weeping bitterly,\r\ninsensible to everything but the deep wound in her breast, stunned by\r\nthe loss of all she loved, left like the sole survivor on a lonely\r\nshore from the wreck of a great vessel, she fled without a thought,\r\nwithout a hope, without a purpose, but to fly somewhere anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe cheerful vista of the long street, burnished by the morning light,\r\nthe sight of the blue sky and airy clouds, the vigorous freshness of\r\nthe day, so flushed and rosy in its conquest of the night, awakened no\r\nresponsive feelings in her so hurt bosom. Somewhere, anywhere, to hide\r\nher head! somewhere, anywhere, for refuge, never more to look upon the\r\nplace from which she fled!\r\n\r\nBut there were people going to and fro; there were opening shops, and\r\nservants at the doors of houses; there was the rising clash and roar of\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s struggle. Florence saw surprise and curiosity in the faces\r\nflitting past her; saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement; and\r\nheard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went, and\r\nwhat the matter was; and though these frightened her the more at first,\r\nand made her hurry on the faster, they did her the good service of\r\nrecalling her in some degree to herself, and reminding her of the\r\nnecessity of greater composure.\r\n\r\nWhere to go? Still somewhere, anywhere! still going on; but where! She\r\nthought of the only other time she had been lost in the wild wilderness\r\nof London\xe2\x80\x94though not lost as now\xe2\x80\x94and went that way. To the home of\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle.\r\n\r\nChecking her sobs, and drying her swollen eyes, and endeavouring to\r\ncalm the agitation of her manner, so as to avoid attracting notice,\r\nFlorence, resolving to keep to the more quiet streets as long as she\r\ncould, was going on more quietly herself, when a familiar little shadow\r\ndarted past upon the sunny pavement, stopped short, wheeled about, came\r\nclose to her, made off again, bounded round and round her, and\r\nDiogenes, panting for breath, and yet making the street ring with his\r\nglad bark, was at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Di! oh, dear, true, faithful Di, how did you come here? How could\r\nI ever leave you, Di, who would never leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence bent down on the pavement, and laid his rough, old, loving,\r\nfoolish head against her breast, and they got up together, and went on\r\ntogether; Di more off the ground than on it, endeavouring to kiss his\r\nmistress flying, tumbling over and getting up again without the least\r\nconcern, dashing at big dogs in a jocose defiance of his species,\r\nterrifying with touches of his nose young housemaids who were cleaning\r\ndoorsteps, and continually stopping, in the midst of a thousand\r\nextravagances, to look back at Florence, and bark until all the dogs\r\nwithin hearing answered, and all the dogs who could come out, came out\r\nto stare at him.\r\n\r\nWith this last adherent, Florence hurried away in the advancing\r\nmorning, and the strengthening sunshine, to the City. The roar soon\r\ngrew more loud, the passengers more numerous, the shops more busy,\r\nuntil she was carried onward in a stream of life setting that way, and\r\nflowing, indifferently, past marts and mansions, prisons, churches,\r\nmarket-places, wealth, poverty, good, and evil, like the broad river\r\nside by side with it, awakened from its dreams of rushes, willows, and\r\ngreen moss, and rolling on, turbid and troubled, among the works and\r\ncares of men, to the deep sea.\r\n\r\nAt length the quarters of the little Midshipman arose in view. Nearer\r\nyet, and the little Midshipman himself was seen upon his post, intent\r\nas ever on his observations. Nearer yet, and the door stood open,\r\ninviting her to enter. Florence, who had again quickened her pace, as\r\nshe approached the end of her journey, ran across the road (closely\r\nfollowed by Diogenes, whom the bustle had somewhat confused), ran in,\r\nand sank upon the threshold of the well-remembered little parlour.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, in his glazed hat, was standing over the fire, making his\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s cocoa, with that elegant trifle, his watch, upon the\r\nchimney-piece, for easy reference during the progress of the cookery.\r\nHearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress, the Captain turned with a\r\npalpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger, at the instant\r\nwhen Florence made a motion with her hand towards him, reeled, and fell\r\nupon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, pale as Florence, pale in the very knobs upon his face,\r\nraised her like a baby, and laid her on the same old sofa upon which\r\nshe had slumbered long ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, looking intently in her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the sweet creetur grow\xe2\x80\x99d a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle was so respectful of her, and had such a reverence for\r\nher, in this new character, that he would not have held her in his\r\narms, while she was unconscious, for a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, withdrawing to a little\r\ndistance, with the greatest alarm and sympathy depicted on his\r\ncountenance. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can hail Ned Cuttle with a finger, do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Florence did not stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trembling Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr drownded in the briny deep, turn to, and histe up something or\r\nanother, if able!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding her insensible to this impressive adjuration also, Captain\r\nCuttle snatched from his breakfast-table a basin of cold water, and\r\nsprinkled some upon her face. Yielding to the urgency of the case, the\r\nCaptain then, using his immense hand with extraordinary gentleness,\r\nrelieved her of her bonnet, moistened her lips and forehead, put back\r\nher hair, covered her feet with his own coat which he pulled off for\r\nthe purpose, patted her hand\xe2\x80\x94so small in his, that he was struck with\r\nwonder when he touched it\xe2\x80\x94and seeing that her eyelids quivered, and\r\nthat her lips began to move, continued these restorative applications\r\nwith a better heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheerily,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cCheerily! Stand by, my pretty one, stand\r\nby! There! You\xe2\x80\x99re better now. Steady\xe2\x80\x99s the word, and steady it is. Keep\r\nher so! Drink a little drop o\xe2\x80\x99 this here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you\r\nare! What cheer now, my pretty, what cheer now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this stage of her recovery, Captain Cuttle, with an imperfect\r\nassociation of a Watch with a Physician\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of a patient, took\r\nhis own down from the mantel-shelf, and holding it out on his hook, and\r\ntaking Florence\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his, looked steadily from one to the other,\r\nas expecting the dial to do something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer, my pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer now? You\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nher some good, my lad, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, under his breath,\r\nand throwing an approving glance upon his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cPut you back\r\nhalf-an-hour every morning, and about another quarter towards the\r\narternoon, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a watch as can be ekalled by few and excelled by\r\nnone. What cheer, my lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle! Is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Florence, raising herself a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, hastily deciding in his own\r\nmind upon the superior elegance of that form of address, as the most\r\ncourtly he could think of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Walter\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t been here this many a\r\nlong day. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t been heerd on, since he sheered off arter poor\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr. But,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, as a quotation, \xe2\x80\x9cThough lost to sight,\r\nto memory dear, and England, Home, and Beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you live here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Captain Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, putting her hands together, and\r\nspeaking wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cSave me! keep me here! Let no one know where I am!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what has happened by-and-by, when I can. I have no one in\r\nthe world to go to. Do not send me away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend you away, my lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, my Heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDelight! Stay a bit! We\xe2\x80\x99ll put up this here deadlight, and take a\r\ndouble turn on the key!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the Captain, using his one hand and his hook with the\r\ngreatest dexterity, got out the shutter of the door, put it up, made it\r\nall fast, and locked the door itself.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back to the side of Florence, she took his hand, and\r\nkissed it. The helplessness of the action, the appeal it made to him,\r\nthe confidence it expressed, the unspeakable sorrow in her face, the\r\npain of mind she had too plainly suffered, and was suffering then, his\r\nknowledge of her past history, her present lonely, worn, and\r\nunprotected appearance, all so rushed upon the good Captain together,\r\nthat he fairly overflowed with compassion and gentleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, polishing the bridge of his nose with\r\nhis arm until it shone like burnished copper, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you say a word to\r\nEd\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, until such times as you finds yourself a riding smooth\r\nand easy; which won\xe2\x80\x99t be today, nor yet to-morrow. And as to giving of\r\nyou up, or reporting where you are, yes verily, and by God\xe2\x80\x99s help, so I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, Church catechism, make a note on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis the Captain said, reference and all, in one breath, and with much\r\nsolemnity; taking off his hat at \xe2\x80\x9cyes verily,\xe2\x80\x9d and putting it on again,\r\nwhen he had quite concluded.\r\n\r\nFlorence could do but one thing more to thank him, and to show him how\r\nshe trusted in him; and she did it. Clinging to this rough creature as\r\nthe last asylum of her bleeding heart, she laid her head upon his\r\nhonest shoulder, and clasped him round his neck, and would have kneeled\r\ndown to bless him, but that he divined her purpose, and held her up\r\nlike a true man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cSteady! You\xe2\x80\x99re too weak to stand, you see,\r\nmy pretty, and must lie down here again. There, there!\xe2\x80\x9d To see the\r\nCaptain lift her on the sofa, and cover her with his coat, would have\r\nbeen worth a hundred state sights. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust take some breakfast, lady lass, and the dog shall have some too.\r\nAnd arter that you shall go aloft to old Sol Gills\xe2\x80\x99s room, and fall\r\nasleep there, like a angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle patted Diogenes when he made allusion to him, and\r\nDiogenes met that overture graciously, half-way. During the\r\nadministration of the restoratives he had clearly been in two minds\r\nwhether to fly at the Captain or to offer him his friendship; and he\r\nhad expressed that conflict of feeling by alternate waggings of his\r\ntail, and displays of his teeth, with now and then a growl or so. But\r\nby this time, his doubts were all removed. It was plain that he\r\nconsidered the Captain one of the most amiable of men, and a man whom\r\nit was an honour to a dog to know.\r\n\r\nIn evidence of these convictions, Diogenes attended on the Captain\r\nwhile he made some tea and toast, and showed a lively interest in his\r\nhousekeeping. But it was in vain for the kind Captain to make such\r\npreparations for Florence, who sorely tried to do some honour to them,\r\nbut could touch nothing, and could only weep and weep again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said the compassionate Captain, \xe2\x80\x9carter turning in, my\r\nHeart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get more way upon you. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll serve out your\r\nallowance, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d To Diogenes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you shall keep guard on your\r\nmistress aloft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiogenes, however, although he had been eyeing his intended breakfast\r\nwith a watering mouth and glistening eyes, instead of falling to,\r\nravenously, when it was put before him, pricked up his ears, darted to\r\nthe shop-door, and barked there furiously: burrowing with his head at\r\nthe bottom, as if he were bent on mining his way out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan there be anybody there!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99d stay there, without\r\nmaking any noise! Keep up a good heart, pretty. It\xe2\x80\x99s only people going\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut for all that, Diogenes barked and barked, and burrowed and\r\nburrowed, with pertinacious fury; and whenever he stopped to listen,\r\nappeared to receive some new conviction into his mind, for he set to,\r\nbarking and burrowing again, a dozen times. Even when he was persuaded\r\nto return to his breakfast, he came jogging back to it, with a very\r\ndoubtful air; and was off again, in another paroxysm, before touching a\r\nmorsel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there should be someone listening and watching,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nFlorence. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone who saw me come\xe2\x80\x94who followed me, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t the young woman, lady lass, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, taken\r\nwith a bright idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cAh no! Susan has been gone\r\nfrom me a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot deserted, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that that there\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s run, my pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is one of the truest hearts in the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was greatly relieved by this reply, and expressed his\r\nsatisfaction by taking off his hard glazed hat, and dabbing his head\r\nall over with his handkerchief, rolled up like a ball, observing\r\nseveral times, with infinite complacency, and with a beaming\r\ncountenance, that he know\xe2\x80\x99d it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re quiet now, are you, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain to Diogenes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody there, my lady lass, bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiogenes was not so sure of that. The door still had an attraction for\r\nhim at intervals; and he went snuffing about it, and growling to\r\nhimself, unable to forget the subject. This incident, coupled with the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s observation of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue and faintness, decided him\r\nto prepare Sol Gills\xe2\x80\x99s chamber as a place of retirement for her\r\nimmediately. He therefore hastily betook himself to the top of the\r\nhouse, and made the best arrangement of it that his imagination and his\r\nmeans suggested.\r\n\r\nIt was very clean already; and the Captain, being an orderly man, and\r\naccustomed to make things ship-shape, converted the bed into a couch,\r\nby covering it all over with a clean white drapery. By a similar\r\ncontrivance, the Captain converted the little dressing-table into a\r\nspecies of altar, on which he set forth two silver teaspoons, a\r\nflower-pot, a telescope, his celebrated watch, a pocket-comb, and a\r\nsong-book, as a small collection of rarities, that made a choice\r\nappearance. Having darkened the window, and straightened the pieces of\r\ncarpet on the floor, the Captain surveyed these preparations with great\r\ndelight, and descended to the little parlour again, to bring Florence\r\nto her bower.\r\n\r\nNothing would induce the Captain to believe that it was possible for\r\nFlorence to walk upstairs. If he could have got the idea into his head,\r\nhe would have considered it an outrageous breach of hospitality to\r\nallow her to do so. Florence was too weak to dispute the point, and the\r\nCaptain carried her up out of hand, laid her down, and covered her with\r\na great watch-coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re as safe here as if you was at\r\nthe top of St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral, with the ladder cast off. Sleep is what\r\nyou want, afore all other things, and may you be able to show yourself\r\nsmart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded\r\nmind! When there\xe2\x80\x99s anything you want, my Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight, as this here\r\nhumble house or town can offer, pass the word to Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, as\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstand off and on outside that door, and that there man will wibrate\r\nwith joy.\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain concluded by kissing the hand that Florence\r\nstretched out to him, with the chivalry of any old knight-errant, and\r\nwalking on tiptoe out of the room.\r\n\r\nDescending to the little parlour, Captain Cuttle, after holding a hasty\r\ncouncil with himself, decided to open the shop-door for a few minutes,\r\nand satisfy himself that now, at all events, there was no one loitering\r\nabout it. Accordingly he set it open, and stood upon the threshold,\r\nkeeping a bright look-out, and sweeping the whole street with his\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow de do, Captain Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice beside him. The Captain,\r\nlooking down, found that he had been boarded by Mr Toots while sweeping\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are, you, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty well, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow I\xe2\x80\x99m never quite what I could wish to be, now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that\r\nI ever shall be any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots never approached any nearer than this to the great theme of\r\nhis life, when in conversation with Captain Cuttle, on account of the\r\nagreement between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cif I could have the pleasure of a word\r\nwith you, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s rather particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, leading the way into the\r\nparlour, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t what you may call exactly free this morning; and\r\ntherefore if you can clap on a bit, I should take it kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, who seldom had any notion\r\nof the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cTo clap on, is exactly what I could wish to\r\ndo. Naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so be, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDo it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was so impressed by the possession of his tremendous\r\nsecret\xe2\x80\x94by the fact of Miss Dombey being at that moment under his roof,\r\nwhile the innocent and unconscious Toots sat opposite to him\xe2\x80\x94that a\r\nperspiration broke out on his forehead, and he found it impossible,\r\nwhile slowly drying the same, glazed hat in hand, to keep his eyes off\r\nMr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s face. Mr Toots, who himself appeared to have some secret\r\nreasons for being in a nervous state, was so unspeakably disconcerted\r\nby the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s stare, that after looking at him vacantly for some\r\ntime in silence, and shifting uneasily on his chair, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Captain Gills, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to see anything\r\nparticular in me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots with a chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m wasting\r\naway. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t at all mind alluding to that. I\xe2\x80\x94I should like it.\r\nBurgess and Co. have altered my measure, I\xe2\x80\x99m in that state of thinness.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a gratification to me. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d a great deal rather\r\ngo into a decline, if I could. I\xe2\x80\x99m a mere brute you know, grazing upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, Captain Gills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe more Mr Toots went on in this way, the more the Captain was weighed\r\ndown by his secret, and stared at him. What with this cause of\r\nuneasiness, and his desire to get rid of Mr Toots, the Captain was in\r\nsuch a scared and strange condition, indeed, that if he had been in\r\nconversation with a ghost, he could hardly have evinced greater\r\ndiscomposure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I was going to say, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cHappening to\r\nbe this way early this morning\xe2\x80\x94to tell you the truth, I was coming to\r\nbreakfast with you. As to sleep, you know, I never sleep now. I might\r\nbe a Watchman, except that I don\xe2\x80\x99t get any pay, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing on\r\nhis mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, in an admonitory voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly true! Happening\r\nto be this way early this morning (an hour or so ago), and finding the\r\ndoor shut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! were you waiting there, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a\r\nmoment. I thought you were out. But the person said\xe2\x80\x94by the bye, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep a dog, you, Captain Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I said. I knew you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t. There is a dog, Captain Gills, connected with\xe2\x80\x94but excuse me.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s forbidden ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain stared at Mr Toots until he seemed to swell to twice his\r\nnatural size; and again the perspiration broke out on the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforehead, when he thought of Diogenes taking it into his head to come\r\ndown and make a third in the parlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person said,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he had heard a dog barking\r\nin the shop: which I knew couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, and I told him so. But he was as\r\npositive as if he had seen the dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat person, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see there it is, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with a\r\nperceptible increase in the nervousness of his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not for me\r\nto say what may have taken place, or what may not have taken place.\r\nIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I get mixed up with all sorts of things that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s something rather weak in\r\nmy\xe2\x80\x94in my head, in short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain nodded his own, as a mark of assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the person said, as we were walking away,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Toots,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you knew what, under existing circumstances, might occur\xe2\x80\x94he said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98might,\xe2\x80\x99 very strongly\xe2\x80\x94and that if you were requested to prepare\r\nyourself, you would, no doubt, come prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerson, my lad\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what person, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea. But coming to the door, I found him waiting\r\nthere; and he said was I coming back again, and I said yes; and he said\r\ndid I know you, and I said, yes, I had the pleasure of your\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x94you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance, after\r\nsome persuasion; and he said, if that was the case, would I say to you\r\nwhat I have said, about existing circumstances and coming prepared, and\r\nas soon as ever I saw you, would I ask you to step round the corner, if\r\nit was only for one minute, on most important business, to Mr Brogley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe Broker\xe2\x80\x99s. Now, I tell you what, Captain Gills\xe2\x80\x94whatever it is, I am\r\nconvinced it\xe2\x80\x99s very important; and if you like to step round, now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwait here till you come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, divided between his fear of compromising Florence in some\r\nway by not going, and his horror of leaving Mr Toots in possession of\r\nthe house with a chance of finding out the secret, was a spectacle of\r\nmental disturbance that even Mr Toots could not be blind to. But that\r\nyoung gentleman, considering his nautical friend as merely in a state\r\nof preparation for the interview he was going to have, was quite\r\nsatisfied, and did not review his own discreet conduct without chuckle.\r\n\r\nAt length the Captain decided, as the lesser of two evils, to run round\r\nto Brogley\xe2\x80\x99s the Broker\xe2\x80\x99s: previously locking the door that\r\ncommunicated with the upper part of the house, and putting the key in\r\nhis pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain to Mr Toots, with not a little\r\nshame and hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cas you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my doing of it, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever you do, is satisfactory\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain thanked him heartily, and promising to come back in less\r\nthan five minutes, went out in quest of the person who had entrusted Mr\r\nToots with this mysterious message. Poor Mr Toots, left to himself, lay\r\ndown upon the sofa, little thinking who had reclined there last, and,\r\ngazing up at the skylight and resigning himself to visions of Miss\r\nDombey, lost all heed of time and place.\r\n\r\nIt was as well that he did so; for although the Captain was not gone\r\nlong, he was gone much longer than he had proposed. When he came back,\r\nhe was very pale indeed, and greatly agitated, and even looked as if he\r\nhad been shedding tears. He seemed to have lost the faculty of speech,\r\nuntil he had been to the cupboard and taken a dram of rum from the\r\ncase-bottle, when he fetched a deep breath, and sat down in a chair\r\nwith his hand before his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toots, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope and trust there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nwrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, my lad, not a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite contrairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the appearance of being overcome, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr\r\nToots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my lad, I am took aback,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything I can do, Captain Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere is, make use of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain removed his hand from his face, looked at him with a\r\nremarkable expression of pity and tenderness, and took him by the hand,\r\nand shook it hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Only I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it as a\r\nfavour if you\xe2\x80\x99ll part company for the present. I believe, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwringing his hand again, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, after Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, and on a different model,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re as good a lad as ever stepped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word and honour, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, giving the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s hand a preliminary slap before shaking it again, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelightful to me to possess your good opinion. Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd bear a hand and cheer up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, patting him on the\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! There\xe2\x80\x99s more than one sweet creetur in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to me, I\r\nassure you. The state of my feelings towards Miss Dombey is of that\r\nunspeakable description, that my heart is a desert island, and she\r\nlives in it alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting more used up every day, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to\r\nbe so. If you could see my legs when I take my boots off, you\xe2\x80\x99d form\r\nsome idea of what unrequited affection is. I have been prescribed bark,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to have any tone whatever given\r\nto my constitution. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not. This, however, is forbidden ground.\r\nCaptain Gills, goodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle cordially reciprocating the warmth of Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarewell, locked the door behind him, and shaking his head with the\r\nsame remarkable expression of pity and tenderness as he had regarded\r\nhim with before, went up to see if Florence wanted him.\r\n\r\nThere was an entire change in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face as he went upstairs.\r\nHe wiped his eyes with his handkerchief, and he polished the bridge of\r\nhis nose with his sleeve as he had done already that morning, but his\r\nface was absolutely changed. Now, he might have been thought supremely\r\nhappy; now, he might have been thought sad; but the kind of gravity\r\nthat sat upon his features was quite new to them, and was as great an\r\nimprovement to them as if they had undergone some sublimating process.\r\n\r\nHe knocked softly, with his hook, at Florence\xe2\x80\x99s door, twice or thrice;\r\nbut, receiving no answer, ventured first to peep in, and then to enter:\r\nemboldened to take the latter step, perhaps, by the familiar\r\nrecognition of Diogenes, who, stretched upon the ground by the side of\r\nher couch, wagged his tail, and winked his eyes at the Captain, without\r\nbeing at the trouble of getting up.\r\n\r\nShe was sleeping heavily, and moaning in her sleep; and Captain Cuttle,\r\nwith a perfect awe of her youth, and beauty, and her sorrow, raised her\r\nhead, and adjusted the coat that covered her, where it had fallen off,\r\nand darkened the window a little more that she might sleep on, and\r\ncrept out again, and took his post of watch upon the stairs. All this,\r\nwith a touch and tread as light as Florence\xe2\x80\x99s own.\r\n\r\nLong may it remain in this mixed world a point not easy of decision,\r\nwhich is the more beautiful evidence of the Almighty\xe2\x80\x99s goodness\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndelicate fingers that are formed for sensitiveness and sympathy of\r\ntouch, and made to minister to pain and grief, or the rough hard\r\nCaptain Cuttle hand, that the heart teaches, guides, and softens in a\r\nmoment!\r\n\r\nFlorence slept upon her couch, forgetful of her homelessness and\r\norphanage, and Captain Cuttle watched upon the stairs. A louder sob or\r\nmoan than usual, brought him sometimes to her door; but by degrees she\r\nslept more peacefully, and the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s watch was undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nThe Midshipman makes a Discovery\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was long before Florence awoke. The day was in its prime, the day\r\nwas in its wane, and still, uneasy in mind and body, she slept on;\r\nunconscious of her strange bed, of the noise and turmoil in the street,\r\nand of the light that shone outside the shaded window. Perfect\r\nunconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more,\r\neven the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce. Some undefined\r\nand mournful recollection of it, dozing uneasily but never sleeping,\r\npervaded all her rest. A dull sorrow, like a half-lulled sense of pain,\r\nwas always present to her; and her pale cheek was oftener wet with\r\ntears than the honest Captain, softly putting in his head from time to\r\ntime at the half-closed door, could have desired to see it.\r\n\r\nThe sun was getting low in the west, and, glancing out of a red mist,\r\npierced with its rays opposite loopholes and pieces of fretwork in the\r\nspires of city churches, as if with golden arrows that struck through\r\nand through them\xe2\x80\x94and far away athwart the river and its flat banks, it\r\nwas gleaming like a path of fire\xe2\x80\x94and out at sea it was irradiating\r\nsails of ships\xe2\x80\x94and, looked towards, from quiet churchyards, upon\r\nhill-tops in the country, it was steeping distant prospects in a flush\r\nand glow that seemed to mingle earth and sky together in one glorious\r\nsuffusion\xe2\x80\x94when Florence, opening her heavy eyes, lay at first, looking\r\nwithout interest or recognition at the unfamiliar walls around her, and\r\nlistening in the same regardless manner to the noises in the street.\r\nBut presently she started up upon her couch, gazed round with a\r\nsurprised and vacant look, and recollected all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, knocking at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat cheer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, hurrying to him, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain felt so much pride in the name, and was so pleased by the\r\ngleam of pleasure in her face, when she saw him, that he kissed his\r\nhook, by way of reply, in speechless gratification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer, bright di\xe2\x80\x99mond?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have surely slept very long,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I come\r\nhere? Yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis here blessed day, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas there been no night? Is it still day?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting on for evening now, my pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, drawing back\r\nthe curtain of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence, with her hand upon the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s arm, so sorrowful and timid,\r\nand the Captain with his rough face and burly figure, so quietly\r\nprotective of her, stood in the rosy light of the bright evening sky,\r\nwithout saying a word. However strange the form of speech into which he\r\nmight have fashioned the feeling, if he had had to give it utterance,\r\nthe Captain felt, as sensibly as the most eloquent of men could have\r\ndone, that there was something in the tranquil time and in its softened\r\nbeauty that would make the wounded heart of Florence overflow; and that\r\nit was better that such tears should have their way. So not a word\r\nspake Captain Cuttle. But when he felt his arm clasped closer, and when\r\nhe felt the lonely head come nearer to it, and lay itself against his\r\nhomely coarse blue sleeve, he pressed it gently with his rugged hand,\r\nand understood it, and was understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter now, my pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cCheerily, cheerily, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\ndown below, and get some dinner ready. Will you come down of your own\r\nself, arterwards, pretty, or shall Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle come and fetch you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Florence assured him that she was quite able to walk downstairs, the\r\nCaptain, though evidently doubtful of his own hospitality in permitting\r\nit, left her to do so, and immediately set about roasting a fowl at the\r\nfire in the little parlour. To achieve his cookery with the greater\r\nskill, he pulled off his coat, tucked up his wristbands, and put on his\r\nglazed hat, without which assistant he never applied himself to any\r\nnice or difficult undertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter cooling her aching head and burning face in the fresh water which\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s care had provided for her while she slept, Florence went\r\nto the little mirror to bind up her disordered hair. Then she knew\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nmoment, for she shunned it instantly, that on her breast there was the\r\ndarkening mark of an angry hand.\r\n\r\nHer tears burst forth afresh at the sight; she was ashamed and afraid\r\nof it; but it moved her to no anger against him. Homeless and\r\nfatherless, she forgave him everything; hardly thought that she had\r\nneed to forgive him, or that she did; but she fled from the idea of him\r\nas she had fled from the reality, and he was utterly gone and lost.\r\nThere was no such Being in the world.\r\n\r\nWhat to do, or where to live, Florence\xe2\x80\x94poor, inexperienced girl!\xe2\x80\x94could\r\nnot yet consider. She had indistinct dreams of finding, a long way off,\r\nsome little sisters to instruct, who would be gentle with her, and to\r\nwhom, under some feigned name, she might attach herself, and who would\r\ngrow up in their happy home, and marry, and be good to their old\r\ngoverness, and perhaps entrust her, in time, with the education of\r\ntheir own daughters. And she thought how strange and sorrowful it would\r\nbe, thus to become a grey-haired woman, carrying her secret to the\r\ngrave, when Florence Dombey was forgotten. But it was all dim and\r\nclouded to her now. She only knew that she had no Father upon earth,\r\nand she said so, many times, with her suppliant head hidden from all,\r\nbut her Father who was in Heaven.\r\n\r\nHer little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas. With a part of\r\nthis, it would be necessary to buy some clothes, for she had none but\r\nthose she wore. She was too desolate to think how soon her money would\r\nbe gone\xe2\x80\x94too much a child in worldly matters to be greatly troubled on\r\nthat score yet, even if her other trouble had been less. She tried to\r\ncalm her thoughts and stay her tears; to quiet the hurry in her\r\nthrobbing head, and bring herself to believe that what had happened\r\nwere but the events of a few hours ago, instead of weeks or months, as\r\nthey appeared; and went down to her kind protector.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had spread the cloth with great care, and was making some\r\negg-sauce in a little saucepan: basting the fowl from time to time\r\nduring the process with a strong interest, as it turned and browned on\r\na string before the fire. Having propped Florence up with cushions on\r\nthe sofa, which was already wheeled into a warm corner for her greater\r\ncomfort, the Captain pursued his cooking with extraordinary skill,\r\nmaking hot gravy in a second little saucepan, boiling a handful of\r\npotatoes in a third, never forgetting the egg-sauce in the first, and\r\nmaking an impartial round of basting and stirring with the most useful\r\nof spoons every minute. Besides these cares, the Captain had to keep\r\nhis eye on a diminutive frying-pan, in which some sausages were hissing\r\nand bubbling in a most musical manner; and there was never such a\r\nradiant cook as the Captain looked, in the height and heat of these\r\nfunctions: it being impossible to say whether his face or his glazed\r\nhat shone the brighter.\r\n\r\nThe dinner being at length quite ready, Captain Cuttle dished and\r\nserved it up, with no less dexterity than he had cooked it. He then\r\ndressed for dinner, by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his\r\ncoat. That done, he wheeled the table close against Florence on the\r\nsofa, said grace, unscrewed his hook, screwed his fork into its place,\r\nand did the honours of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9ccheer up, and try to eat a deal.\r\nStand by, my deary! Liver wing it is. Sarse it is. Sassage it is. And\r\npotato!\xe2\x80\x9d all which the Captain ranged symmetrically on a plate, and\r\npouring hot gravy on the whole with the useful spoon, set before his\r\ncherished guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole row o\xe2\x80\x99 dead lights is up, for\xe2\x80\x99ard, lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nCaptain, encouragingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand everythink is made snug. Try and pick a\r\nbit, my pretty. If Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr was here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! If I had him for my brother now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t take on, my pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cawast, to obleege\r\nme! He was your nat\xe2\x80\x99ral born friend like, warn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Pet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence had no words to answer with. She only said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear\r\nPaul! oh, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wery planks she walked on,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Captain, looking at her\r\ndrooping face, \xe2\x80\x9cwas as high esteemed by Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, as the water brooks is\r\nby the hart which never rejices! I see him now, the wery day as he was\r\nrated on them Dombey books, a speaking of her with his face a\r\nglistening with doo\xe2\x80\x94leastways with his modest sentiments\xe2\x80\x94like a new\r\nblowed rose, at dinner. Well, well! If our poor Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr was here, my lady\r\nlass\xe2\x80\x94or if he could be\xe2\x80\x94for he\xe2\x80\x99s drownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; drownded,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, soothingly; \xe2\x80\x9cas I was saying,\r\nif he could be here he\xe2\x80\x99d beg and pray of you, my precious, to pick a\r\nleetle bit, with a look-out for your own sweet health. Whereby, hold\r\nyour own, my lady lass, as if it was for Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and lay your\r\npretty head to the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence essayed to eat a morsel, for the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure. The\r\nCaptain, meanwhile, who seemed to have quite forgotten his own dinner,\r\nlaid down his knife and fork, and drew his chair to the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr was a trim lad, warn\xe2\x80\x99t he, precious?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, after\r\nsitting for some time silently rubbing his chin, with his eyes fixed\r\nupon her, \xe2\x80\x9cand a brave lad, and a good lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence tearfully assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s drownded, Beauty, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, in a soothing\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nFlorence could not but assent again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was older than you, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nwas like two children together, at first; wam\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x99s drownded,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe repetition of this inquiry was a curious source of consolation, but\r\nit seemed to be one to Captain Cuttle, for he came back to it again and\r\nagain. Florence, fain to push from her her untasted dinner, and to lie\r\nback on her sofa, gave him her hand, feeling that she had disappointed\r\nhim, though truly wishing to have pleased him after all his trouble,\r\nbut he held it in his own (which shook as he held it), and appearing to\r\nhave quite forgotten all about the dinner and her want of appetite,\r\nwent on growling at intervals, in a ruminating tone of sympathy, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr. Ay, ay! Drownded. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d And always waited for her answer,\r\nin which the great point of these singular reflections appeared to\r\nconsist.\r\n\r\nThe fowl and sausages were cold, and the gravy and the egg-sauce\r\nstagnant, before the Captain remembered that they were on the board,\r\nand fell to with the assistance of Diogenes, whose united efforts\r\nquickly dispatched the banquet. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s delight and wonder at the\r\nquiet housewifery of Florence in assisting to clear the table, arrange\r\nthe parlour, and sweep up the hearth\xe2\x80\x94only to be equalled by the\r\nfervency of his protest when she began to assist him\xe2\x80\x94were gradually\r\nraised to that degree, that at last he could not choose but do nothing\r\nhimself, and stand looking at her as if she were some Fairy, daintily\r\nperforming these offices for him; the red rim on his forehead glowing\r\nagain, in his unspeakable admiration.\r\n\r\nBut when Florence, taking down his pipe from the mantel-shelf gave it\r\ninto his hand, and entreated him to smoke it, the good Captain was so\r\nbewildered by her attention that he held it as if he had never held a\r\npipe, in all his life. Likewise, when Florence, looking into the little\r\ncupboard, took out the case-bottle and mixed a perfect glass of grog\r\nfor him, unasked, and set it at his elbow, his ruddy nose turned pale,\r\nhe felt himself so graced and honoured. When he had filled his pipe in\r\nan absolute reverie of satisfaction, Florence lighted it for him\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nCaptain having no power to object, or to prevent her\xe2\x80\x94and resuming her\r\nplace on the old sofa, looked at him with a smile so loving and so\r\ngrateful, a smile that showed him so plainly how her forlorn heart\r\nturned to him, as her face did, through grief, that the smoke of the\r\npipe got into the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s throat and made him cough, and got into the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and made them blink and water.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Captain tried to make believe that the cause of\r\nthese effects lay hidden in the pipe itself, and the way in which he\r\nlooked into the bowl for it, and not finding it there, pretended to\r\nblow it out of the stem, was wonderfully pleasant. The pipe soon\r\ngetting into better condition, he fell into that state of repose\r\nbecoming a good smoker; but sat with his eyes fixed on Florence, and,\r\nwith a beaming placidity not to be described, and stopping every now\r\nand then to discharge a little cloud from his lips, slowly puffed it\r\nforth, as if it were a scroll coming out of his mouth, bearing the\r\nlegend \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, ay, ay. Drownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d after which he would\r\nresume his smoking with infinite gentleness.\r\n\r\nUnlike as they were externally\xe2\x80\x94and there could scarcely be a more\r\ndecided contrast than between Florence in her delicate youth and\r\nbeauty, and Captain Cuttle with his knobby face, his great broad\r\nweather-beaten person, and his gruff voice\xe2\x80\x94in simple innocence of the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s ways and the world\xe2\x80\x99s perplexities and dangers, they were nearly\r\non a level. No child could have surpassed Captain Cuttle in\r\ninexperience of everything but wind and weather; in simplicity,\r\ncredulity, and generous trustfulness. Faith, hope, and charity, shared\r\nhis whole nature among them. An odd sort of romance, perfectly\r\nunimaginative, yet perfectly unreal, and subject to no considerations\r\nof worldly prudence or practicability, was the only partner they had in\r\nhis character. As the Captain sat, and smoked, and looked at Florence,\r\nGod knows what impossible pictures, in which she was the principal\r\nfigure, presented themselves to his mind. Equally vague and uncertain,\r\nthough not so sanguine, were her own thoughts of the life before her;\r\nand even as her tears made prismatic colours in the light she gazed at,\r\nso, through her new and heavy grief, she already saw a rainbow faintly\r\nshining in the far-off sky. A wandering princess and a good monster in\r\na storybook might have sat by the fireside, and talked as Captain\r\nCuttle and poor Florence talked\xe2\x80\x94and not have looked very much unlike\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty\r\nin retaining Florence, or of any responsibility thereby incurred.\r\nHaving put up the shutters and locked the door, he was quite satisfied\r\non this head. If she had been a Ward in Chancery, it would have made no\r\ndifference at all to Captain Cuttle. He was the last man in the world\r\nto be troubled by any such considerations.\r\n\r\nSo the Captain smoked his pipe very comfortably, and Florence and he\r\nmeditated after their own manner. When the pipe was out, they had some\r\ntea; and then Florence entreated him to take her to some neighbouring\r\nshop, where she could buy the few necessaries she immediately wanted.\r\nIt being quite dark, the Captain consented: peeping carefully out\r\nfirst, as he had been wont to do in his time of hiding from Mrs\r\nMacStinger; and arming himself with his large stick, in case of an\r\nappeal to arms being rendered necessary by any unforeseen circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe pride Captain Cuttle had, in giving his arm to Florence, and\r\nescorting her some two or three hundred yards, keeping a bright\r\nlook-out all the time, and attracting the attention of everyone who\r\npassed them, by his great vigilance and numerous precautions, was\r\nextreme. Arrived at the shop, the Captain felt it a point of delicacy\r\nto retire during the making of the purchases, as they were to consist\r\nof wearing apparel; but he previously deposited his tin canister on the\r\ncounter, and informing the young lady of the establishment that it\r\ncontained fourteen pound two, requested her, in case that amount of\r\nproperty should not be sufficient to defray the expenses of his niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle outfit\xe2\x80\x94at the word \xe2\x80\x9cniece,\xe2\x80\x9d he bestowed a most significant look\r\non Florence, accompanied with pantomime, expressive of sagacity and\r\nmystery\xe2\x80\x94to have the goodness to \xe2\x80\x9csing out,\xe2\x80\x9d and he would make up the\r\ndifference from his pocket. Casually consulting his big watch, as a\r\ndeep means of dazzling the establishment, and impressing it with a\r\nsense of property, the Captain then kissed his hook to his niece, and\r\nretired outside the window, where it was a choice sight to see his\r\ngreat face looking in from time to time, among the silks and ribbons,\r\nwith an obvious misgiving that Florence had been spirited away by a\r\nback door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, when she came out with a parcel,\r\nthe size of which greatly disappointed the Captain, who had expected to\r\nsee a porter following with a bale of goods, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want this money,\r\nindeed. I have not spent any of it. I have money of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the baffled Captain, looking straight down the\r\nstreet before them, \xe2\x80\x9ctake care on it for me, will you be so good, till\r\nsuch time as I ask ye for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I put it back in its usual place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand keep it\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was not at all gratified by this proposal, but he answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, put it anywheres, my lady lass, so long as you know where to\r\nfind it again. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99 no use to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t chucked it away afore now.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was quite disheartened for the moment, but he revived at\r\nthe first touch of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and they returned with the same\r\nprecautions as they had come; the Captain opening the door of the\r\nlittle Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s berth, and diving in, with a suddenness which his\r\ngreat practice only could have taught him. During Florence\xe2\x80\x99s slumber in\r\nthe morning, he had engaged the daughter of an elderly lady who usually\r\nsat under a blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market, selling poultry, to\r\ncome and put her room in order, and render her any little services she\r\nrequired; and this damsel now appearing, Florence found everything\r\nabout her as convenient and orderly, if not as handsome, as in the\r\nterrible dream she had once called Home.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone again, the Captain insisted on her eating a slice\r\nof dry toast, and drinking a glass of spiced negus (which he made to\r\nperfection); and, encouraging her with every kind word and\r\ninconsequential quotation he could possibly think of, led her upstairs\r\nto her bedroom. But he too had something on his mind, and was not easy\r\nin his manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, dear heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle to her at her\r\nchamber-door.\r\n\r\nFlorence raised her lips to his face, and kissed him.\r\n\r\nAt any other time the Captain would have been overbalanced by such a\r\ntoken of her affection and gratitude; but now, although he was very\r\nsensible of it, he looked in her face with even more uneasiness than he\r\nhad testified before, and seemed unwilling to leave her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, poor Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\nFlorence shook her head, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Cuttle, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, dear, kind friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Captain lingered still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anything the matter, dear Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, easily\r\nalarmed in her then state of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you, lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, meeting her eyes in\r\nconfusion. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; what should I have to tell you, pretty! You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything good to tell you, sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, shaking her head.\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked at her wistfully, and repeated \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 still\r\nlingering, and still showing embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, as I used to call you! Old\r\nSol Gills\xe2\x80\x99s nevy! Welcome to all as knowed you, as the flowers in May!\r\nWhere are you got to, brave boy? Drownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConcluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to Florence, the\r\nCaptain bade her good-night, and descended the stairs, while Florence\r\nremained at the top, holding the candle out to light him down. He was\r\nlost in the obscurity, and, judging from the sound of his receding\r\nfootsteps, was in the act of turning into the little parlour, when his\r\nhead and shoulders unexpectedly emerged again, as from the deep,\r\napparently for no other purpose than to repeat, \xe2\x80\x9cDrownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he,\r\npretty?\xe2\x80\x9d For when he had said that in a tone of tender condolence, he\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nFlorence was very sorry that she should unwittingly, though naturally,\r\nhave awakened these associations in the mind of her protector, by\r\ntaking refuge there; and sitting down before the little table where the\r\nCaptain had arranged the telescope and song-book, and those other\r\nrarities, thought of Walter, and of all that was connected with him in\r\nthe past, until she could have almost wished to lie down on her bed and\r\nfade away. But in her lonely yearning to the dead whom she had loved,\r\nno thought of home\xe2\x80\x94no possibility of going back\xe2\x80\x94no presentation of it\r\nas yet existing, or as sheltering her father\xe2\x80\x94once entered her thoughts.\r\nShe had seen the murder done. In the last lingering natural aspect in\r\nwhich she had cherished him through so much, he had been torn out of\r\nher heart, defaced, and slain. The thought of it was so appalling to\r\nher, that she covered her eyes, and shrunk trembling from the least\r\nremembrance of the deed, or of the cruel hand that did it. If her fond\r\nheart could have held his image after that, it must have broken; but it\r\ncould not; and the void was filled with a wild dread that fled from all\r\nconfronting with its shattered fragments\xe2\x80\x94with such a dread as could\r\nhave risen out of nothing but the depths of such a love, so wronged.\r\n\r\nShe dared not look into the glass; for the sight of the darkening mark\r\nupon her bosom made her afraid of herself, as if she bore about her\r\nsomething wicked. She covered it up, with a hasty, faltering hand, and\r\nin the dark; and laid her weary head down, weeping.\r\n\r\nThe Captain did not go to bed for a long time. He walked to and fro in\r\nthe shop and in the little parlour, for a full hour, and, appearing to\r\nhave composed himself by that exercise, sat down with a grave and\r\nthoughtful face, and read out of a Prayer-book the forms of prayer\r\nappointed to be used at sea. These were not easily disposed of; the\r\ngood Captain being a mighty slow, gruff reader, and frequently stopping\r\nat a hard word to give himself such encouragement as \xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lad! With\r\na will!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cSteady, Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, steady!\xe2\x80\x9d which had a great effect\r\nin helping him out of any difficulty. Moreover, his spectacles greatly\r\ninterfered with his powers of vision. But notwithstanding these\r\ndrawbacks, the Captain, being heartily in earnest, read the service to\r\nthe very last line, and with genuine feeling too; and approving of it\r\nvery much when he had done, turned in, under the counter (but not\r\nbefore he had been upstairs, and listened at Florence\xe2\x80\x99s door), with a\r\nserene breast, and a most benevolent visage.\r\n\r\nThe Captain turned out several times in the course of the night, to\r\nassure himself that his charge was resting quietly; and once, at\r\ndaybreak, found that she was awake: for she called to know if it were\r\nhe, on hearing footsteps near her door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, in a growling whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou all right, di\xe2\x80\x99mond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence thanked him, and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain could not lose so favourable an opportunity of applying his\r\nmouth to the keyhole, and calling through it, like a hoarse breeze,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr! Drownded, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d after which he withdrew, and turning\r\nin again, slept till seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nNor was he free from his uneasy and embarrassed manner all that day;\r\nthough Florence, being busy with her needle in the little parlour, was\r\nmore calm and tranquil than she had been on the day preceding. Almost\r\nalways when she raised her eyes from her work, she observed the captain\r\nlooking at her, and thoughtfully stroking his chin; and he so often\r\nhitched his arm-chair close to her, as if he were going to say\r\nsomething very confidential, and hitched it away again, as not being\r\nable to make up his mind how to begin, that in the course of the day he\r\ncruised completely round the parlour in that frail bark, and more than\r\nonce went ashore against the wainscot or the closet door, in a very\r\ndistressed condition.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the twilight that Captain Cuttle, fairly dropping\r\nanchor, at last, by the side of Florence, began to talk at all\r\nconnectedly. But when the light of the fire was shining on the walls\r\nand ceiling of the little room, and on the tea-board and the cups and\r\nsaucers that were ranged upon the table, and on her calm face turned\r\ntowards the flame, and reflecting it in the tears that filled her eyes,\r\nthe Captain broke a long silence thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never was at sea, my own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, reverentially; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a almighty element.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s wonders in the deep, my pretty. Think on it when the winds is\r\nroaring and the waves is rowling. Think on it when the stormy nights is\r\nso pitch dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, solemnly holding up his hook, \xe2\x80\x9cas you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see your hand afore you, excepting when the wiwid lightning\r\nreweals the same; and when you drive, drive, drive through the storm\r\nand dark, as if you was a driving, head on, to the world without end,\r\nevermore, amen, and when found making a note of. Them\xe2\x80\x99s the times, my\r\nbeauty, when a man may say to his messmate (previously a overhauling of\r\nthe wollume), \xe2\x80\x98A stiff nor\xe2\x80\x99wester\xe2\x80\x99s blowing, Bill; hark, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear\r\nit roar now! Lord help \xe2\x80\x99em, how I pitys all unhappy folks ashore now!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhich quotation, as particularly applicable to the terrors of the\r\nocean, the Captain delivered in a most impressive manner, concluding\r\nwith a sonorous \xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you ever in a dreadful storm?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy ay, my lady lass, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my share of bad weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, tremulously wiping his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my share of\r\nknocking about; but\xe2\x80\x94but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t of myself as I was a meaning to speak.\r\nOur dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d drawing closer to her, \xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, darling, as was\r\ndrownded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain spoke in such a trembling voice, and looked at Florence\r\nwith a face so pale and agitated, that she clung to his hand in\r\naffright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour face is changed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are altered in a moment.\r\nWhat is it? Dear Captain Cuttle, it turns me cold to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, supporting her with his hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be took aback. No, no! All\xe2\x80\x99s well, all\xe2\x80\x99s well, my dear. As I was\r\na saying\xe2\x80\x94Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s drownded. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence looked at him intently; her colour came and went; and she laid\r\nher hand upon her breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s perils and dangers on the deep, my beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand over many a brave ship, and many and many a bould heart, the\r\nsecret waters has closed up, and never told no tales. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nescapes upon the deep, too, and sometimes one man out of a score,\xe2\x80\x94ah!\r\nmaybe out of a hundred, pretty,\xe2\x80\x94has been saved by the mercy of God, and\r\ncome home after being given over for dead, and told of all hands lost.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94I know a story, Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9co\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\nnatur, as was told to me once; and being on this here tack, and you and\r\nme sitting alone by the fire, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear me tell it.\r\nWould you, deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence, trembling with an agitation which she could not control or\r\nunderstand, involuntarily followed his glance, which went behind her\r\ninto the shop, where a lamp was burning. The instant that she turned\r\nher head, the Captain sprung out of his chair, and interposed his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there, my beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Captain murmured something about its being dull that way, and about\r\nthe fire being cheerful. He drew the door ajar, which had been standing\r\nopen until now, and resumed his seat. Florence followed him with her\r\neyes, and looked intently in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story was about a ship, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d began the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nsailed out of the Port of London, with a fair wind and in fair weather,\r\nbound for\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be took aback, my lady lass, she was only out\xe2\x80\x99ard\r\nbound, pretty, only out\xe2\x80\x99ard bound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression on Florence\xe2\x80\x99s face alarmed the Captain, who was himself\r\nvery hot and flurried, and showed scarcely less agitation than she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go on, Beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, pray!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Captain made a gulp as if to get down something that was sticking\r\nin his throat, and nervously proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there unfort\xe2\x80\x99nate ship met with such foul weather, out at sea, as\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t blow once in twenty year, my darling. There was hurricanes ashore\r\nas tore up forests and blowed down towns, and there was gales at sea in\r\nthem latitudes, as not the stoutest wessel ever launched could live in.\r\nDay arter day that there unfort\xe2\x80\x99nate ship behaved noble, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, and\r\ndid her duty brave, my pretty, but at one blow a\xe2\x80\x99most her bulwarks was\r\nstove in, her masts and rudder carved away, her best man swept\r\noverboard, and she left to the mercy of the storm as had no mercy but\r\nblowed harder and harder yet, while the waves dashed over her, and beat\r\nher in, and every time they come a thundering at her, broke her like a\r\nshell. Every black spot in every mountain of water that rolled away was\r\na bit o\xe2\x80\x99 the ship\xe2\x80\x99s life or a living man, and so she went to pieces,\r\nBeauty, and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned\r\nthat ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were not all lost!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cSome were saved!\xe2\x80\x94Was one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAboard o\xe2\x80\x99 that there unfort\xe2\x80\x99nate wessel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, rising\r\nfrom his chair, and clenching his hand with prodigious energy and\r\nexultation, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a lad, a gallant lad\xe2\x80\x94as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd tell\xe2\x80\x94that had\r\nloved, when he was a boy, to read and talk about brave actions in\r\nshipwrecks\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd him! I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd him!\xe2\x80\x94and he remembered of \xe2\x80\x99em in\r\nhis hour of need; for when the stoutest and oldest hands was hove down,\r\nhe was firm and cheery. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t the want of objects to like and love\r\nashore that gave him courage, it was his nat\xe2\x80\x99ral mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in\r\nhis face, when he was no more than a child\xe2\x80\x94ay, many a time!\xe2\x80\x94and when I\r\nthought it nothing but his good looks, bless him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was he saved!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cWas he saved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat brave lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clook at me, pretty! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nround\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence had hardly power to repeat, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there, my deary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntook aback, pretty creetur! Don\xe2\x80\x99t, for the sake of Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, as was dear\r\nto all on us! That there lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9carter working with\r\nthe best, and standing by the faint-hearted, and never making no\r\ncomplaint nor sign of fear, and keeping up a spirit in all hands that\r\nmade \xe2\x80\x99em honour him as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been a admiral\xe2\x80\x94that lad, along with the\r\nsecond-mate and one seaman, was left, of all the beatin\xe2\x80\x99 hearts that\r\nwent aboard that ship, the only living creeturs\xe2\x80\x94lashed to a fragment of\r\nthe wreck, and driftin\xe2\x80\x99 on the stormy sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they saved?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDays and nights they drifted on them endless waters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil at last\xe2\x80\x94No! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look that way, pretty!\xe2\x80\x94a sail bore\r\ndown upon \xe2\x80\x99em, and they was, by the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, took aboard: two\r\nliving and one dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of them was dead?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the lad I speak on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God! oh thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be took aback! A minute\r\nmore, my lady lass! with a good heart!\xe2\x80\x94aboard that ship, they went a\r\nlong voyage, right away across the chart (for there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no touching\r\nnowhere), and on that voyage the seaman as was picked up with him died.\r\nBut he was spared, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, without knowing what he did, had cut a slice of bread from\r\nthe loaf, and put it on his hook (which was his usual toasting-fork),\r\non which he now held it to the fire; looking behind Florence with great\r\nemotion in his face, and suffering the bread to blaze and burn like\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas spared,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd come home in that ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, still looking in the\r\nsame direction, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, pretty\xe2\x80\x94and landed; and one\r\nmorning come cautiously to his own door to take a obserwation, knowing\r\nthat his friends would think him drownded, when he sheered off at the\r\nunexpected\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the unexpected barking of a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cSteady, darling! courage! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look round\r\nyet. See there! upon the wall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the shadow of a man upon the wall close to her. She started\r\nup, looked round, and with a piercing cry, saw Walter Gay behind her!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe had no thought of him but as a brother, a brother rescued from the\r\ngrave; a shipwrecked brother saved and at her side; and rushed into his\r\narms. In all the world, he seemed to be her hope, her comfort, refuge,\r\nnatural protector. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of Walter, I was fond of Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ndear remembrance of the plaintive voice that said so, rushed upon her\r\nsoul, like music in the night. \xe2\x80\x9cOh welcome home, dear Walter! Welcome\r\nto this stricken breast!\xe2\x80\x9d She felt the words, although she could not\r\nutter them, and held him in her pure embrace.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, in a fit of delirium, attempted to wipe his head with\r\nthe blackened toast upon his hook: and finding it an uncongenial\r\nsubstance for the purpose, put it into the crown of his glazed hat, put\r\nthe glazed hat on with some difficulty, essayed to sing a verse of\r\nLovely Peg, broke down at the first word, and retired into the shop,\r\nwhence he presently came back express, with a face all flushed and\r\nbesmeared, and the starch completely taken out of his shirt-collar, to\r\nsay these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad, here is a little bit of property as I should wish to\r\nmake over, jintly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain hastily produced the big watch, the teaspoons, the\r\nsugar-tongs, and the canister, and laying them on the table, swept them\r\nwith his great hand into Walter\xe2\x80\x99s hat; but in handing that singular\r\nstrong box to Walter, he was so overcome again, that he was fain to\r\nmake another retreat into the shop, and absent himself for a longer\r\nspace of time than on his first retirement.\r\n\r\nBut Walter sought him out, and brought him back; and then the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat apprehension was, that Florence would suffer from this new shock.\r\nHe felt it so earnestly, that he turned quite rational, and positively\r\ninterdicted any further allusion to Walter\xe2\x80\x99s adventures for some days\r\nto come. Captain Cuttle then became sufficiently composed to relieve\r\nhimself of the toast in his hat, and to take his place at the\r\ntea-board; but finding Walter\xe2\x80\x99s grasp upon his shoulder, on one side,\r\nand Florence whispering her tearful congratulations on the other, the\r\nCaptain suddenly bolted again, and was missing for a good ten minutes.\r\n\r\nBut never in all his life had the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face so shone and\r\nglistened, as when, at last, he sat stationary at the tea-board,\r\nlooking from Florence to Walter, and from Walter to Florence. Nor was\r\nthis effect produced or at all heightened by the immense quantity of\r\npolishing he had administered to his face with his coat-sleeve during\r\nthe last half-hour. It was solely the effect of his internal emotions.\r\nThere was a glory and delight within the Captain that spread itself\r\nover his whole visage, and made a perfect illumination there.\r\n\r\nThe pride with which the Captain looked upon the bronzed cheek and the\r\ncourageous eyes of his recovered boy; with which he saw the generous\r\nfervour of his youth, and all its frank and hopeful qualities, shining\r\nonce more, in the fresh, wholesome manner, and the ardent face, would\r\nhave kindled something of this light in his countenance. The admiration\r\nand sympathy with which he turned his eyes on Florence, whose beauty,\r\ngrace, and innocence could have won no truer or more zealous champion\r\nthan himself, would have had an equal influence upon him. But the\r\nfulness of the glow he shed around him could only have been engendered\r\nin his contemplation of the two together, and in all the fancies\r\nspringing out of that association, that came sparkling and beaming into\r\nhis head, and danced about it.\r\n\r\nHow they talked of poor old Uncle Sol, and dwelt on every little\r\ncircumstance relating to his disappearance; how their joy was moderated\r\nby the old man\xe2\x80\x99s absence and by the misfortunes of Florence; how they\r\nreleased Diogenes, whom the Captain had decoyed upstairs some time\r\nbefore, lest he should bark again; the Captain, though he was in one\r\ncontinual flutter, and made many more short plunges into the shop,\r\nfully comprehended. But he no more dreamed that Walter looked on\r\nFlorence, as it were, from a new and far-off place; that while his eyes\r\noften sought the lovely face, they seldom met its open glance of\r\nsisterly affection, but withdrew themselves when hers were raised\r\ntowards him; than he believed that it was Walter\xe2\x80\x99s ghost who sat beside\r\nhim. He saw them together in their youth and beauty, and he knew the\r\nstory of their younger days, and he had no inch of room beneath his\r\ngreat blue waistcoat for anything save admiration of such a pair, and\r\ngratitude for their being reunited.\r\n\r\nThey sat thus, until it grew late. The Captain would have been content\r\nto sit so for a week. But Walter rose, to take leave for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe slings his hammock for the present, lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain\r\nCuttle, \xe2\x80\x9cround at Brogley\xe2\x80\x99s. Within hail, Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the cause of your going away, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a\r\nhouseless sister in your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Walter, hesitating\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif it is not too bold\r\nto call you so!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94If anything could make me happier in being allowed to see and speak\r\nto you, would it not be the discovery that I had any means on earth of\r\ndoing you a moment\xe2\x80\x99s service! Where would I not go, what would I not\r\ndo, for your sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and called him brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so changed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI changed!\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94To me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, softly, as if he were thinking aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cchanged\r\nto me. I left you such a child, and find you\xe2\x80\x94oh! something so\r\ndifferent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your sister, Walter. You have not forgotten what we promised to\r\neach other, when we parted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d But he said no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you had\xe2\x80\x94if suffering and danger had driven it from your\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94which it has not\xe2\x80\x94you would remember it now, Walter, when you\r\nfind me poor and abandoned, with no home but this, and no friends but\r\nthe two who hear me speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would! Heaven knows I would!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Florence, through her sobs and tears. \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nbrother! Show me some way through the world\xe2\x80\x94some humble path that I may\r\ntake alone, and labour in, and sometimes think of you as one who will\r\nprotect and care for me as for a sister! Oh, help me, Walter, for I\r\nneed help so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey! Florence! I would die to help you. But your friends are\r\nproud and rich. Your father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d She shrieked, and put her hands up to her head, in an\r\nattitude of terror that transfixed him where he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that\r\nword!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never, from that hour, forgot the voice and look with which she\r\nstopped him at the name. He felt that if he were to live a hundred\r\nyears, he never could forget it.\r\n\r\nSomewhere\xe2\x80\x94anywhere\xe2\x80\x94but never home! All past, all gone, all lost, and\r\nbroken up! The whole history of her untold slight and suffering was in\r\nthe cry and look; and he felt he never could forget it, and he never\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nShe laid her gentle face upon the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and related how\r\nand why she had fled. If every sorrowing tear she shed in doing so, had\r\nbeen a curse upon the head of him she never named or blamed, it would\r\nhave been better for him, Walter thought, with awe, than to be\r\nrenounced out of such a strength and might of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, precious!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, when she ceased; and deep\r\nattention the Captain had paid to her while she spoke; listening, with\r\nhis glazed hat all awry and his mouth wide open. \xe2\x80\x9cAwast, awast, my\r\neyes! Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, dear lad, sheer off for tonight, and leave the pretty one\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter took her hand in both of his, and put it to his lips, and kissed\r\nit. He knew now that she was, indeed, a homeless wandering fugitive;\r\nbut, richer to him so, than in all the wealth and pride of her right\r\nstation, she seemed farther off than even on the height that had made\r\nhim giddy in his boyish dreams.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, perplexed by no such meditations, guarded Florence to\r\nher room, and watched at intervals upon the charmed ground outside her\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94for such it truly was to him\xe2\x80\x94until he felt sufficiently easy in\r\nhis mind about her, to turn in under the counter. On abandoning his\r\nwatch for that purpose, he could not help calling once, rapturously,\r\nthrough the keyhole, \xe2\x80\x9cDrownded. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t he, pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, when he got\r\ndownstairs, making another trial at that verse of Lovely Peg. But it\r\nstuck in his throat somehow, and he could make nothing of it; so he\r\nwent to bed, and dreamed that old Sol Gills was married to Mrs\r\nMacStinger, and kept prisoner by that lady in a secret chamber on a\r\nshort allowance of victuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nMr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an empty room above-stairs at the wooden Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s, which,\r\nin days of yore, had been Walter\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Walter, rousing up the\r\nCaptain betimes in the morning, proposed that they should carry thither\r\nsuch furniture out of the little parlour as would grace it best, so\r\nthat Florence might take possession of it when she rose. As nothing\r\ncould be more agreeable to Captain Cuttle than making himself very red\r\nand short of breath in such a cause, he turned to (as he himself said)\r\nwith a will; and, in a couple of hours, this garret was transformed\r\ninto a species of land-cabin, adorned with all the choicest moveables\r\nout of the parlour, inclusive even of the Tartar frigate, which the\r\nCaptain hung up over the chimney-piece with such extreme delight, that\r\nhe could do nothing for half-an-hour afterwards but walk backward from\r\nit, lost in admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Captain could be induced by no persuasion of Walter\xe2\x80\x99s to wind up\r\nthe big watch, or to take back the canister, or to touch the\r\nsugar-tongs and teaspoons. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my lad;\xe2\x80\x9d was the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvariable reply to any solicitation of the kind, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made that there\r\nlittle property over, jintly.\xe2\x80\x9d These words he repeated with great\r\nunction and gravity, evidently believing that they had the virtue of an\r\nAct of Parliament, and that unless he committed himself by some new\r\nadmission of ownership, no flaw could be found in such a form of\r\nconveyance.\r\n\r\nIt was an advantage of the new arrangement, that besides the greater\r\nseclusion it afforded Florence, it admitted of the Midshipman being\r\nrestored to his usual post of observation, and also of the shop\r\nshutters being taken down. The latter ceremony, however little\r\nimportance the unconscious Captain attached to it, was not wholly\r\nsuperfluous; for, on the previous day, so much excitement had been\r\noccasioned in the neighbourhood, by the shutters remaining unopened,\r\nthat the Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s house had been honoured with an unusual\r\nshare of public observation, and had been intently stared at from the\r\nopposite side of the way, by groups of hungry gazers, at any time\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset. The idlers and vagabonds had been\r\nparticularly interested in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s fate; constantly grovelling in\r\nthe mud to apply their eyes to the cellar-grating, under the\r\nshop-window, and delighting their imaginations with the fancy that they\r\ncould see a piece of his coat as he hung in a corner; though this\r\nsettlement of him was stoutly disputed by an opposite faction, who were\r\nof opinion that he lay murdered with a hammer, on the stairs. It was\r\nnot without exciting some discontent, therefore, that the subject of\r\nthese rumours was seen early in the morning standing at his shop-door\r\nas hale and hearty as if nothing had happened; and the beadle of that\r\nquarter, a man of an ambitious character, who had expected to have the\r\ndistinction of being present at the breaking open of the door, and of\r\ngiving evidence in full uniform before the coroner, went so far as to\r\nsay to an opposite neighbour, that the chap in the glazed hat had\r\nbetter not try it on there\xe2\x80\x94without more particularly mentioning\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94and further, that he, the beadle, would keep his eye upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, musing, when they stood resting from\r\ntheir labours at the shop-door, looking down the old familiar street;\r\nit being still early in the morning; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing at all of Uncle Sol, in\r\nall that time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone in search of me, dear, kind old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter: \xe2\x80\x9cyet never\r\nwrite to you! But why not? He says, in effect, in this packet that you\r\ngave me,\xe2\x80\x9d taking the paper from his pocket, which had been opened in\r\nthe presence of the enlightened Bunsby, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you never hear from\r\nhim before opening it, you may believe him dead. Heaven forbid! But you\r\nwould have heard of him, even if he were dead! Someone would have\r\nwritten, surely, by his desire, if he could not; and have said, \xe2\x80\x98on\r\nsuch a day, there died in my house,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98under my care,\xe2\x80\x99 or so forth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Solomon Gills of London, who left this last remembrance and this\r\nlast request to you\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who had never climbed to such a clear height of\r\nprobability before, was greatly impressed by the wide prospect it\r\nopened, and answered, with a thoughtful shake of his head, \xe2\x80\x9cWell said,\r\nmy lad; wery well said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of this, or, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, colouring,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of one thing and another, all through a sleepless\r\nnight, and I cannot believe, Captain Cuttle, but that my Uncle Sol\r\n(Lord bless him!) is alive, and will return. I don\xe2\x80\x99t so much wonder at\r\nhis going away, because, leaving out of consideration that spice of the\r\nmarvellous which was always in his character, and his great affection\r\nfor me, before which every other consideration of his life became\r\nnothing, as no one ought to know so well as I who had the best of\r\nfathers in him,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Walter\xe2\x80\x99s voice was indistinct and husky here, and he\r\nlooked away, along the street,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cleaving that out of consideration, I\r\nsay, I have often read and heard of people who, having some near and\r\ndear relative, who was supposed to be shipwrecked at sea, have gone\r\ndown to live on that part of the sea-shore where any tidings of the\r\nmissing ship might be expected to arrive, though only an hour or two\r\nsooner than elsewhere, or have even gone upon her track to the place\r\nwhither she was bound, as if their going would create intelligence. I\r\nthink I should do such a thing myself, as soon as another, or sooner\r\nthan many, perhaps. But why my Uncle shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write to you, when he so\r\nclearly intended to do so, or how he should die abroad, and you not\r\nknow it through some other hand, I cannot make out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle observed, with a shake of his head, that Jack Bunsby\r\nhimself hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made it out, and that he was a man as could give a\r\npretty taut opinion too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my Uncle had been a heedless young man, likely to be entrapped by\r\njovial company to some drinking-place, where he was to be got rid of\r\nfor the sake of what money he might have about him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter; \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nif he had been a reckless sailor, going ashore with two or three\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 pay in his pocket, I could understand his disappearing, and\r\nleaving no trace behind. But, being what he was\xe2\x80\x94and is, I hope\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain, wistfully eyeing him as he\r\npondered and pondered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you make of it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of it. I\r\nsuppose he never has written! There is no doubt about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so be as Sol Gills wrote, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain,\r\nargumentatively, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s his dispatch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that he entrusted it to some private hand,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthat it has been forgotten, or carelessly thrown aside, or lost. Even\r\nthat is more probable to me, than the other event. In short, I not only\r\ncannot bear to contemplate that other event, Captain Cuttle, but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, and won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope, you see, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, sagely, \xe2\x80\x9cHope. It\xe2\x80\x99s that as\r\nanimates you. Hope is a buoy, for which you overhaul your Little\r\nWarbler, sentimental diwision, but Lord, my lad, like any other buoy,\r\nit only floats; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be steered nowhere. Along with the figure-head\r\nof Hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a anchor; but what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\nmy having a anchor, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t find no bottom to let it go in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle said this rather in his character of a sagacious citizen\r\nand householder, bound to impart a morsel from his stores of wisdom to\r\nan inexperienced youth, than in his own proper person. Indeed, his face\r\nwas quite luminous as he spoke, with new hope, caught from Walter; and\r\nhe appropriately concluded by slapping him on the back; and saying,\r\nwith enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, my lad! Indiwidually, I\xe2\x80\x99m o\xe2\x80\x99 your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter, with his cheerful laugh, returned the salutation, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one word more about my Uncle at present, Captain Cuttle. I\r\nsuppose it is impossible that he can have written in the ordinary\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94by mail packet, or ship letter, you understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And that you have missed the letter, anyhow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, turning his eyes upon him with a faint\r\napproach to a severe expression, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t I been on the look-out for any\r\ntidings of that man o\xe2\x80\x99 science, old Sol Gills, your Uncle, day and\r\nnight, ever since I lost him? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t my heart been heavy and watchful\r\nalways, along of him and you? Sleeping and waking, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I been upon my\r\npost, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I scorn to quit it while this here Midshipman held\r\ntogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Walter, grasping his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\r\nwould, and I know how faithful and earnest all you say and feel is. I\r\nam sure of it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that I am as sure of it as I am that my\r\nfoot is again upon this door-step, or that I again have hold of this\r\ntrue hand. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, with his beaming\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hazard no more conjectures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, fervently shaking the\r\nhard hand of the Captain, who shook his with no less goodwill. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I\r\nwill add is, Heaven forbid that I should touch my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s possessions,\r\nCaptain Cuttle! Everything that he left here, shall remain in the care\r\nof the truest of stewards and kindest of men\xe2\x80\x94and if his name is not\r\nCuttle, he has no name! Now, best of friends, about\xe2\x80\x94Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a change in Walter\xe2\x80\x99s manner, as he came to these two words;\r\nand when he uttered them, all his confidence and cheerfulness appeared\r\nto have deserted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, before Miss Dombey stopped me when I spoke of her father\r\nlast night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94you remember how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain well remembered, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore that, that we had but one hard duty\r\nto perform, and that it was, to prevail upon her to communicate with\r\nher friends, and to return home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain muttered a feeble \xe2\x80\x9cAwast!\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d or something or\r\nother, equally pertinent to the occasion; but it was rendered so\r\nextremely feeble by the total discomfiture with which he received this\r\nannouncement, that what it was, is mere matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is over. I think so, no longer. I would\r\nsooner be put back again upon that piece of wreck, on which I have so\r\noften floated, since my preservation, in my dreams, and there left to\r\ndrift, and drive, and die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Captain, in a burst of uncontrollable\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar! hooroar! hooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think that she, so young, so good, and beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\ndelicately brought up, and born to such a different fortune, should\r\nstrive with the rough world! But we have seen the gulf that cuts off\r\nall behind her, though no one but herself can know how deep it is; and\r\nthere is no return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, without quite understanding this, greatly approved of\r\nit, and observed in a tone of strong corroboration, that the wind was\r\nquite abaft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ought not to be alone here; ought she, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWalter, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, after a little sagacious\r\nconsideration. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You being here to keep her company, you\r\nsee, and you two being jintly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Captain Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI being here! Miss Dombey,\r\nin her guileless innocent heart, regards me as her adopted brother; but\r\nwhat would the guile and guilt of my heart be, if I pretended to\r\nbelieve that I had any right to approach her, familiarly, in that\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94if I pretended to forget that I am bound, in honour, not to\r\ndo it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d hinted the Captain, with some revival of his\r\ndiscomfiture, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t there no other character as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you have me die in her esteem\xe2\x80\x94in such\r\nesteem as hers\xe2\x80\x94and put a veil between myself and her angel\xe2\x80\x99s face for\r\never, by taking advantage of her being here for refuge, so trusting and\r\nso unprotected, to endeavour to exalt myself into her lover? What do I\r\nsay? There is no one in the world who would be more opposed to me if I\r\ncould do so, than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, drooping more and more, \xe2\x80\x9cprowiding\r\nas there is any just cause or impediment why two persons should not be\r\njined together in the house of bondage, for which you\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul the\r\nplace and make a note, I hope I should declare it as promised and wowed\r\nin the banns. So there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no other character; ain\xe2\x80\x99t there, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter briskly waved his hand in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the Captain slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t deny but what I\r\nfind myself wery much down by the head, along o\xe2\x80\x99 this here, or but what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone clean about. But as to Lady lass, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, mind you, wot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespect and duty to her, is respect and duty in my articles, howsumever\r\ndisapinting; and therefore I follows in your wake, my lad, and feel as\r\nyou are, no doubt, acting up to yourself. And there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no other\r\ncharacter, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, musing over the ruins of his\r\nfallen castle, with a very despondent face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Captain Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, starting a fresh point with a gayer\r\nair, to cheer the Captain up\xe2\x80\x94but nothing could do that; he was too much\r\nconcerned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think we should exert ourselves to find someone who would\r\nbe a proper attendant for Miss Dombey while she remains here, and who\r\nmay be trusted. None of her relations may. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear Miss Dombey feels\r\nthat they are all subservient to her father. What has become of Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my belief as she was\r\nsent away again the will of Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight. I made a signal for her\r\nwhen Lady lass first come, and she rated of her wery high, and said she\r\nhad been gone a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you ask Miss Dombey where she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll try to find her. The morning\xe2\x80\x99s getting on, and Miss Dombey will\r\nsoon be rising. You are her best friend. Wait for her upstairs, and\r\nleave me to take care of all down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, very crest-fallen indeed, echoed the sigh with which\r\nWalter said this, and complied. Florence was delighted with her new\r\nroom, anxious to see Walter, and overjoyed at the prospect of greeting\r\nher old friend Susan. But Florence could not say where Susan was gone,\r\nexcept that it was in Essex, and no one could say, she remembered,\r\nunless it were Mr Toots.\r\n\r\nWith this information the melancholy Captain returned to Walter, and\r\ngave him to understand that Mr Toots was the young gentleman whom he\r\nhad encountered on the door-step, and that he was a friend of his, and\r\nthat he was a young gentleman of property, and that he hopelessly\r\nadored Miss Dombey. The Captain also related how the intelligence of\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s supposed fate had first made him acquainted with Mr Toots, and\r\nhow there was solemn treaty and compact between them, that Mr Toots\r\nshould be mute upon the subject of his love.\r\n\r\nThe question then was, whether Florence could trust Mr Toots; and\r\nFlorence saying, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, with her whole heart!\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nbecame important to find out where Mr Toots lived. This, Florence\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and the Captain had forgotten; and the Captain was telling\r\nWalter, in the little parlour, that Mr Toots was sure to be there soon,\r\nwhen in came Mr Toots himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, rushing into the parlour without any\r\nceremony, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a state of mind bordering on distraction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots had discharged those words, as from a mortar, before he\r\nobserved Walter, whom he recognised with what may be described as a\r\nchuckle of misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, holding his forehead, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nat present in that state that my brain is going, if not gone, and\r\nanything approaching to politeness in an individual so situated would\r\nbe a hollow mockery. Captain Gills, I beg to request the favour of a\r\nprivate interview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Brother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, taking him by the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nthe man as we was on the look-out for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a look-out that must be, of\r\nwhich I am the object! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t dared to shave, I\xe2\x80\x99m in that rash\r\nstate. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had my clothes brushed. My hair is matted together. I\r\ntold the Chicken that if he offered to clean my boots, I\xe2\x80\x99d stretch him\r\na Corpse before me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these indications of a disordered mind were verified in Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance, which was wild and savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThis here\xe2\x80\x99s old Sol Gills\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnevy Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr. Him as was supposed to have perished at sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots took his hand from his forehead, and stared at Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious me!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a complication of misery!\r\nHow-de-do? I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you must have got very wet. Captain Gills,\r\nwill you allow me a word in the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the Captain by the coat, and going out with him whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat then, Captain Gills, is the party you spoke of, when you said\r\nthat he and Miss Dombey were made for one another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ay, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the disconsolate Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI was of that\r\nmind once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at this time!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr Toots, with his hand to his forehead\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cOf all others!\xe2\x80\x94a hated rival! At least, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t a hated\r\nrival,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, stopping short, on second thoughts, and taking\r\naway his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat should I hate him for? No. If my affection has\r\nbeen truly disinterested, Captain Gills, let me prove it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots shot back abruptly into the parlour, and said, wringing Walter\r\nby the hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow-de-do? I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t take any cold. I\xe2\x80\x94I shall be very glad if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll give me the pleasure of your acquaintance. I wish you many happy\r\nreturns of the day. Upon my word and honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, warming as\r\nhe became better acquainted with Walter\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\nglad to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, heartily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t desire a more genuine\r\nand genial welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, though?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, still shaking his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery kind of you. I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you. How-de-do? I hope you left\r\neverybody quite well over the\xe2\x80\x94that is, upon the\xe2\x80\x94I mean wherever you\r\ncame from last, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these good wishes, and better intentions, Walter responded to\r\nmanfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI should wish to be strictly\r\nhonourable; but I trust I may be allowed now, to allude to a certain\r\nsubject that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cFreely, freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cand Lieutenant Walters\xe2\x80\x94are you\r\naware that the most dreadful circumstances have been happening at Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s house, and that Miss Dombey herself has left her father, who,\r\nin my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with great excitement, \xe2\x80\x9cis a Brute, that\r\nit would be a flattery to call a\xe2\x80\x94a marble monument, or a bird of\r\nprey,\xe2\x80\x94and that she is not to be found, and has gone no one knows\r\nwhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask how you heard this?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Walters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, who had arrived at that\r\nappellation by a process peculiar to himself; probably by jumbling up\r\nhis Christian name with the seafaring profession, and supposing some\r\nrelationship between him and the Captain, which would extend, as a\r\nmatter of course, to their titles; \xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Walters, I can have no\r\nobjection to make a straightforward reply. The fact is, that feeling\r\nextremely interested in everything that relates to Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x94not for\r\nany selfish reason, Lieutenant Walters, for I am well aware that the\r\nmost able thing I could do for all parties would be to put an end to my\r\nexistence, which can only be regarded as an inconvenience\xe2\x80\x94I have been\r\nin the habit of bestowing a trifle now and then upon a footman; a most\r\nrespectable young man, of the name of Towlinson, who has lived in the\r\nfamily some time; and Towlinson informed me, yesterday evening, that\r\nthis was the state of things. Since which, Captain Gills\xe2\x80\x94and Lieutenant\r\nWalters\xe2\x80\x94I have been perfectly frantic, and have been lying down on the\r\nsofa all night, the Ruin you behold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to be able to relieve your mind.\r\nPray calm yourself. Miss Dombey is safe and well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr Toots, starting from his chair and shaking hands with\r\nhim anew, \xe2\x80\x9cthe relief is so excessive, and unspeakable, that if you\r\nwere to tell me now that Miss Dombey was married even, I could smile.\r\nYes, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, appealing to him, \xe2\x80\x9cupon my soul and\r\nbody, I really think, whatever I might do to myself immediately\r\nafterwards, that I could smile, I am so relieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a greater relief and delight still, to such a generous mind\r\nas yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, not at all slow in returning his greeting, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nfind that you can render service to Miss Dombey. Captain Cuttle, will\r\nyou have the kindness to take Mr Toots upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain beckoned to Mr Toots, who followed him with a bewildered\r\ncountenance, and, ascending to the top of the house, was introduced,\r\nwithout a word of preparation from his conductor, into Florence\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s amazement and pleasure at sight of her were such, that\r\nthey could find a vent in nothing but extravagance. He ran up to her,\r\nseized her hand, kissed it, dropped it, seized it again, fell upon one\r\nknee, shed tears, chuckled, and was quite regardless of his danger of\r\nbeing pinned by Diogenes, who, inspired by the belief that there was\r\nsomething hostile to his mistress in these demonstrations, worked round\r\nand round him, as if only undecided at what particular point to go in\r\nfor the assault, but quite resolved to do him a fearful mischief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Di, you bad, forgetful dog! Dear Mr Toots, I am so rejoiced to see\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI am pretty well, I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you,\r\nMiss Dombey. I hope all the family are the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots said this without the least notion of what he was talking\r\nabout, and sat down on a chair, staring at Florence with the liveliest\r\ncontention of delight and despair going on in his face that any face\r\ncould exhibit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills and Lieutenant Walters have mentioned, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngasped Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can do you some service. If I could by any\r\nmeans wash out the remembrance of that day at Brighton, when I\r\nconducted myself\xe2\x80\x94much more like a Parricide than a person of\r\nindependent property,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with severe self-accusation, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould sink into the silent tomb with a gleam of joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Mr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not wish me to forget anything in\r\nour acquaintance. I never can, believe me. You have been far too kind\r\nand good to me always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyour consideration for my feelings\r\nis a part of your angelic character. Thank you a thousand times. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof no consequence at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we thought of asking you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cis, whether you\r\nremember where Susan, whom you were so kind as to accompany to the\r\ncoach-office when she left me, is to be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I do not certainly, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, after a little\r\nconsideration, \xe2\x80\x9cremember the exact name of the place that was on the\r\ncoach; and I do recollect that she said she was not going to stop\r\nthere, but was going farther on. But, Miss Dombey, if your object is to\r\nfind her, and to have her here, myself and the Chicken will produce her\r\nwith every dispatch that devotion on my part, and great intelligence on\r\nthe Chicken\xe2\x80\x99s, can ensure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of\r\nbeing useful, and the disinterested sincerity of his devotion was so\r\nunquestionable, that it would have been cruel to refuse him. Florence,\r\nwith an instinctive delicacy, forbore to urge the least obstacle,\r\nthough she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks; and Mr Toots\r\nproudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, touching her proffered hand, with a pang\r\nof hopeless love visibly shooting through him, and flashing out in his\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye! Allow me to take the liberty of saying, that your\r\nmisfortunes make me perfectly wretched, and that you may trust me, next\r\nto Captain Gills himself. I am quite aware, Miss Dombey, of my own\r\ndeficiencies\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re not of the least consequence, thank you\xe2\x80\x94but I am\r\nentirely to be relied upon, I do assure you, Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Mr Toots came out of the room, again accompanied by the\r\nCaptain, who, standing at a little distance, holding his hat under his\r\narm and arranging his scattered locks with his hook, had been a not\r\nuninterested witness of what passed. And when the door closed behind\r\nthem, the light of Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s life was darkly clouded again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said that gentleman, stopping near the bottom of the\r\nstairs, and turning round, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you the truth, I am not in a frame\r\nof mind at the present moment, in which I could see Lieutenant Walters\r\nwith that entirely friendly feeling towards him that I should wish to\r\nharbour in my breast. We cannot always command our feelings, Captain\r\nGills, and I should take it as a particular favour if you\xe2\x80\x99d let me out\r\nat the private door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall shape your own course.\r\nWotever course you take, is plain and seamanlike, I\xe2\x80\x99m wery sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re extremely kind. Your good\r\nopinion is a consolation to me. There is one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots,\r\nstanding in the passage, behind the half-opened door, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll bear in mind, Captain Gills, and that I should wish Lieutenant\r\nWalters to be made acquainted with. I have quite come into my property\r\nnow, you know, and\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with it. If I could be\r\nat all useful in a pecuniary point of view, I should glide into the\r\nsilent tomb with ease and smoothness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots said no more, but slipped out quietly and shut the door upon\r\nhimself, to cut the Captain off from any reply.\r\n\r\nFlorence thought of this good creature, long after he had left her,\r\nwith mingled emotions of pain and pleasure. He was so honest and\r\nwarm-hearted, that to see him again and be assured of his truth to her\r\nin her distress, was a joy and comfort beyond all price; but for that\r\nvery reason, it was so affecting to think that she caused him a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness, or ruffled, by a breath, the harmless current of\r\nhis life, that her eyes filled with tears, and her bosom overflowed\r\nwith pity. Captain Cuttle, in his different way, thought much of Mr\r\nToots too; and so did Walter; and when the evening came, and they were\r\nall sitting together in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s new room, Walter praised him in a\r\nmost impassioned manner, and told Florence what he had said on leaving\r\nthe house, with every graceful setting-off in the way of comment and\r\nappreciation that his own honesty and sympathy could surround it with.\r\n\r\nMr Toots did not return upon the next day, or the next, or for several\r\ndays; and in the meanwhile Florence, without any new alarm, lived like\r\na quiet bird in a cage, at the top of the old Instrument-maker\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nBut Florence drooped and hung her head more and more plainly, as the\r\ndays went on; and the expression that had been seen in the face of the\r\ndead child, was often turned to the sky from her high window, as if it\r\nsought his angel out, on the bright shore of which he had spoken: lying\r\non his little bed.\r\n\r\nFlorence had been weak and delicate of late, and the agitation she had\r\nundergone was not without its influences on her health. But it was no\r\nbodily illness that affected her now. She was distressed in mind; and\r\nthe cause of her distress was Walter.\r\n\r\nInterested in her, anxious for her, proud and glad to serve her, and\r\nshowing all this with the enthusiasm and ardour of his character,\r\nFlorence saw that he avoided her. All the long day through, he seldom\r\napproached her room. If she asked for him, he came, again for the\r\nmoment as earnest and as bright as she remembered him when she was a\r\nlost child in the staring streets; but he soon became constrained\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nquick affection was too watchful not to know it\xe2\x80\x94and uneasy, and soon\r\nleft her. Unsought, he never came, all day, between the morning and the\r\nnight. When the evening closed in, he was always there, and that was\r\nher happiest time, for then she half believed that the old Walter of\r\nher childhood was not changed. But, even then, some trivial word, look,\r\nor circumstance would show her that there was an indefinable division\r\nbetween them which could not be passed.\r\n\r\nAnd she could not but see that these revealings of a great alteration\r\nin Walter manifested themselves in despite of his utmost efforts to\r\nhide them. In his consideration for her, she thought, and in the\r\nearnestness of his desire to spare her any wound from his kind hand, he\r\nresorted to innumerable little artifices and disguises. So much the\r\nmore did Florence feel the greatness of the alteration in him; so much\r\nthe oftener did she weep at this estrangement of her brother.\r\n\r\nThe good Captain\xe2\x80\x94her untiring, tender, ever zealous friend\xe2\x80\x94saw it, too,\r\nFlorence thought, and it pained him. He was less cheerful and hopeful\r\nthan he had been at first, and would steal looks at her and Walter, by\r\nturns, when they were all three together of an evening, with quite a\r\nsad face.\r\n\r\nFlorence resolved, at last, to speak to Walter. She believed she knew\r\nnow what the cause of his estrangement was, and she thought it would be\r\na relief to her full heart, and would set him more at ease, if she told\r\nhim she had found it out, and quite submitted to it, and did not\r\nreproach him.\r\n\r\nIt was on a certain Sunday afternoon, that Florence took this\r\nresolution. The faithful Captain, in an amazing shirt-collar, was\r\nsitting by her, reading with his spectacles on, and she asked him where\r\nWalter was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s down below, my lady lass,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, rising hurriedly as if\r\nto go downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll rouse him up here, Beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cin a trice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the Captain, with much alacrity, shouldered his book\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nmade it a point of duty to read none but very large books on a Sunday,\r\nas having a more staid appearance: and had bargained, years ago, for a\r\nprodigious volume at a book-stall, five lines of which utterly\r\nconfounded him at any time, insomuch that he had not yet ascertained of\r\nwhat subject it treated\xe2\x80\x94and withdrew. Walter soon appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Cuttle tells me, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly began on coming\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94but stopped when he saw her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not so well today. You look distressed. You have been\r\nweeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke so kindly, and with such a fervent tremor in his voice, that\r\nthe tears gushed into her eyes at the sound of his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite well, and I have been\r\nweeping. I want to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down opposite to her, looking at her beautiful and innocent\r\nface; and his own turned pale, and his lips trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said, upon the night when I knew that you were saved\xe2\x80\x94and oh! dear\r\nWalter, what I felt that night, and what I hoped!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his trembling hand upon the table between them, and sat looking\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94that I was changed. I was surprised to hear you say so, but I\r\nunderstand, now, that I am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me, Walter. I was too\r\nmuch overjoyed to think of it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed a child to him again. It was the ingenuous, confiding,\r\nloving child he saw and heard. Not the dear woman, at whose feet he\r\nwould have laid the riches of the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember the last time I saw you, Walter, before you went away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into his breast, and took out a little purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always worn it round my neck! If I had gone down in the deep,\r\nit would have been with me at the bottom of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will wear it still, Walter, for my old sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil I die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on his, as fearlessly and simply, as if not a day had\r\nintervened since she gave him the little token of remembrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that. I shall be always glad to think so, Walter. Do you\r\nrecollect that a thought of this change seemed to come into our minds\r\nat the same time that evening, when we were talking together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in a wondering tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Walter. I had been the means of injuring your hopes and prospects\r\neven then. I feared to think so, then, but I know it now. If you were\r\nable, then, in your generosity, to hide from me that you knew it too,\r\nyou cannot do so now, although you try as generously as before. You do.\r\nI thank you for it, Walter, deeply, truly; but you cannot succeed. You\r\nhave suffered too much in your own hardships, and in those of your\r\ndearest relation, quite to overlook the innocent cause of all the peril\r\nand affliction that has befallen you. You cannot quite forget me in\r\nthat character, and we can be brother and sister no longer. But, dear\r\nWalter, do not think that I complain of you in this. I might have known\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94ought to have known it\xe2\x80\x94but forgot it in my joy. All I hope is that\r\nyou may think of me less irksomely when this feeling is no more a\r\nsecret one; and all I ask is, Walter, in the name of the poor child who\r\nwas your sister once, that you will not struggle with yourself, and\r\npain yourself, for my sake, now that I know all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter had looked upon her while she said this, with a face so full of\r\nwonder and amazement, that it had room for nothing else. Now he caught\r\nup the hand that touched his, so entreatingly, and held it between his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that while I have been\r\nsuffering so much, in striving with my sense of what is due to you, and\r\nmust be rendered to you, I have made you suffer what your words\r\ndisclose to me? Never, never, before Heaven, have I thought of you but\r\nas the single, bright, pure, blessed recollection of my boyhood and my\r\nyouth. Never have I from the first, and never shall I to the last,\r\nregard your part in my life, but as something sacred, never to be\r\nlightly thought of, never to be esteemed enough, never, until death, to\r\nbe forgotten. Again to see you look, and hear you speak, as you did on\r\nthat night when we parted, is happiness to me that there are no words\r\nto utter; and to be loved and trusted as your brother, is the next gift\r\nI could receive and prize!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, looking at him earnestly, but with a changing\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is that which is due to me, and must be rendered to me, at\r\nthe sacrifice of all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRespect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cReverence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour dawned in her face, and she timidly and thoughtfully\r\nwithdrew her hand; still looking at him with unabated earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not a brother\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not a brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclaim. I left a child. I find a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour overspread her face. She made a gesture as if of entreaty\r\nthat he would say no more, and her face dropped upon her hands.\r\n\r\nThey were both silent for a time; she weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe it to a heart so trusting, pure, and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9ceven\r\nto tear myself from it, though I rend my own. How dare I say it is my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was weeping still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been happy; surrounded as you should be by loving and\r\nadmiring friends, and by all that makes the station you were born to\r\nenviable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you had called me brother, then, in\r\nyour affectionate remembrance of the past, I could have answered to the\r\nname from my distant place, with no inward assurance that I wronged\r\nyour spotless truth by doing so. But here\xe2\x80\x94and now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh thank you, thank you, Walter! Forgive my having wronged you so\r\nmuch. I had no one to advise me. I am quite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI am hurried on to say, what I\r\nthought, but a few moments ago, nothing could have forced from my lips.\r\nIf I had been prosperous; if I had any means or hope of being one day\r\nable to restore you to a station near your own; I would have told you\r\nthat there was one name you might bestow upon\xe2\x80\x94me\xe2\x80\x94a right above all\r\nothers, to protect and cherish you\xe2\x80\x94that I was worthy of in nothing but\r\nthe love and honour that I bore you, and in my whole heart being yours.\r\nI would have told you that it was the only claim that you could give me\r\nto defend and guard you, which I dare accept and dare assert; but that\r\nif I had that right, I would regard it as a trust so precious and so\r\npriceless, that the undivided truth and fervour of my life would poorly\r\nacknowledge its worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head was still bent down, the tears still falling, and the bosom\r\nswelling with its sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Florence! Dearest Florence! whom I called so in my thoughts\r\nbefore I could consider how presumptuous and wild it was. One last time\r\nlet me call you by your own dear name, and touch this gentle hand in\r\ntoken of your sisterly forgetfulness of what I have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her head, and spoke to him with such a solemn sweetness in\r\nher eyes; with such a calm, bright, placid smile shining on him through\r\nher tears; with such a low, soft tremble in her frame and voice; that\r\nthe innermost chords of his heart were touched, and his sight was dim\r\nas he listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Walter, I cannot forget it. I would not forget it, for the world.\r\nAre you\xe2\x80\x94are you very poor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am but a wanderer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking voyages to live, across the\r\nsea. That is my calling now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you soon going away again, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat looking at him for a moment; then timidly put her trembling\r\nhand in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will take me for your wife, Walter, I will love you dearly. If\r\nyou will let me go with you, Walter, I will go to the world\xe2\x80\x99s end\r\nwithout fear. I can give up nothing for you\xe2\x80\x94I have nothing to resign,\r\nand no one to forsake; but all my love and life shall be devoted to\r\nyou, and with my last breath I will breathe your name to God if I have\r\nsense and memory left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught her to his heart, and laid her cheek against his own, and\r\nnow, no more repulsed, no more forlorn, she wept indeed, upon the\r\nbreast of her dear lover.\r\n\r\nBlessed Sunday Bells, ringing so tranquilly in their entranced and\r\nhappy ears! Blessed Sunday peace and quiet, harmonising with the\r\ncalmness in their souls, and making holy air around them! Blessed\r\ntwilight stealing on, and shading her so soothingly and gravely, as she\r\nfalls asleep, like a hushed child, upon the bosom she has clung to!\r\n\r\nOh load of love and trustfulness that lies to lightly there! Ay, look\r\ndown on the closed eyes, Walter, with a proudly tender gaze; for in all\r\nthe wide wide world they seek but thee now\xe2\x80\x94only thee!\r\n\r\nThe Captain remained in the little parlour until it was quite dark. He\r\ntook the chair on which Walter had been sitting, and looked up at the\r\nskylight, until the day, by little and little, faded away, and the\r\nstars peeped down. He lighted a candle, lighted a pipe, smoked it out,\r\nand wondered what on earth was going on upstairs, and why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncall him to tea.\r\n\r\nFlorence came to his side while he was in the height of his wonderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! lady lass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you and Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr have had a long\r\nspell o\xe2\x80\x99 talk, my beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence put her little hand round one of the great buttons of his\r\ncoat, and said, looking down into his face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Captain, I want to tell you something, if you please.\r\n\r\nThe Captain raised his head pretty smartly, to hear what it was.\r\nCatching by this means a more distinct view of Florence, he pushed back\r\nhis chair, and himself with it, as far as they could go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, suddenly elated, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal\xe2\x80\x9dr! Husband! THAT?\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Captain, tossing up his glazed hat\r\ninto the skylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, laughing and crying together.\r\n\r\nThe Captain immediately hugged her; and then, picking up the glazed hat\r\nand putting it on, drew her arm through his, and conducted her upstairs\r\nagain; where he felt that the great joke of his life was now to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, looking in at the door, with\r\nhis face like an amiable warming-pan. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there ain\xe2\x80\x99t NO other\r\ncharacter, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had like to have suffocated himself with this pleasantry, which he\r\nrepeated at least forty times during tea; polishing his radiant face\r\nwith the sleeve of his coat, and dabbing his head all over with his\r\npocket-handkerchief, in the intervals. But he was not without a graver\r\nsource of enjoyment to fall back upon, when so disposed, for he was\r\nrepeatedly heard to say in an undertone, as he looked with ineffable\r\ndelight at Walter and Florence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEd\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, my lad, you never shaped a better course in your life,\r\nthan when you made that there little property over, jintly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nMr Dombey and the World\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proud man doing, while the days go by? Does he ever think\r\nof his daughter, or wonder where she is gone? Does he suppose she has\r\ncome home, and is leading her old life in the weary house? No one can\r\nanswer for him. He has never uttered her name, since. His household\r\ndread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely\r\ndumb; and the only person who dares question him, he silences\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul!\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs his sister, sidling into the room, on the day\r\nof Florence\xe2\x80\x99s departure, \xe2\x80\x9cyour wife! that upstart woman! Is it possible\r\nthat what I hear confusedly, is true, and that this is her return for\r\nyour unparalleled devotion to her; extending, I am sure, even to the\r\nsacrifice of your own relations, to her caprices and haughtiness? My\r\npoor brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this speech feelingly reminiscent of her not having been asked to\r\ndinner on the day of the first party, Mrs Chick makes great use of her\r\npocket-handkerchief, and falls on Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s neck. But Mr Dombey\r\nfrigidly lifts her off, and hands her to a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this mark of your affection; but\r\ndesire that our conversation may refer to any other subject. When I\r\nbewail my fate, Louisa, or express myself as being in want of\r\nconsolation, you can offer it, if you will have the goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoins his sister, with her handkerchief to her face,\r\nand shaking her head, \xe2\x80\x9cI know your great spirit, and will say no more\r\nupon a theme so painful and revolting;\xe2\x80\x9d on the heads of which two\r\nadjectives, Mrs Chick visits scathing indignation; \xe2\x80\x9cbut pray let me ask\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94though I dread to hear something that will shock and distress\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94that unfortunate child Florence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa!\xe2\x80\x9d says her brother, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9csilence! Not another word of\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick can only shake her head, and use her handkerchief, and moan\r\nover degenerate Dombeys, who are no Dombeys. But whether Florence has\r\nbeen inculpated in the flight of Edith, or has followed her, or has\r\ndone too much, or too little, or anything, or nothing, she has not the\r\nleast idea.\r\n\r\nHe goes on, without deviation, keeping his thoughts and feelings close\r\nwithin his own breast, and imparting them to no one. He makes no search\r\nfor his daughter. He may think that she is with his sister, or that she\r\nis under his own roof. He may think of her constantly, or he may never\r\nthink about her. It is all one for any sign he makes.\r\n\r\nBut this is sure; he does not think that he has lost her. He has no\r\nsuspicion of the truth. He has lived too long shut up in his towering\r\nsupremacy, seeing her, a patient gentle creature, in the path below it,\r\nto have any fear of that. Shaken as he is by his disgrace, he is not\r\nyet humbled to the level earth. The root is broad and deep, and in the\r\ncourse of years its fibres have spread out and gathered nourishment\r\nfrom everything around it. The tree is struck, but not down.\r\n\r\nThough he hide the world within him from the world without\xe2\x80\x94which he\r\nbelieves has but one purpose for the time, and that, to watch him\r\neagerly wherever he goes\xe2\x80\x94he cannot hide those rebel traces of it, which\r\nescape in hollow eyes and cheeks, a haggard forehead, and a moody,\r\nbrooding air. Impenetrable as before, he is still an altered man; and,\r\nproud as ever, he is humbled, or those marks would not be there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe world. What the world thinks of him, how it looks at him, what it\r\nsees in him, and what it says\xe2\x80\x94this is the haunting demon of his mind.\r\nIt is everywhere where he is; and, worse than that, it is everywhere\r\nwhere he is not. It comes out with him among his servants, and yet he\r\nleaves it whispering behind; he sees it pointing after him in the\r\nstreet; it is waiting for him in his counting-house; it leers over the\r\nshoulders of rich men among the merchants; it goes beckoning and\r\nbabbling among the crowd; it always anticipates him, in every place;\r\nand is always busiest, he knows, when he has gone away. When he is shut\r\nup in his room at night, it is in his house, outside it, audible in\r\nfootsteps on the pavement, visible in print upon the table, steaming to\r\nand fro on railroads and in ships; restless and busy everywhere, with\r\nnothing else but him.\r\n\r\nIt is not a phantom of his imagination. It is as active in other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s minds as in his. Witness Cousin Feenix, who comes from\r\nBaden-Baden, purposely to talk to him. Witness Major Bagstock, who\r\naccompanies Cousin Feenix on that friendly mission.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey receives them with his usual dignity, and stands erect, in\r\nhis old attitude, before the fire. He feels that the world is looking\r\nat him out of their eyes. That it is in the stare of the pictures. That\r\nMr Pitt, upon the bookcase, represents it. That there are eyes in its\r\nown map, hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn unusually cold spring,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x94to deceive the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, in the warmth of friendship, \xe2\x80\x9cJoseph\r\nBagstock is a bad hand at a counterfeit. If you want to hold your\r\nfriends off, Dombey, and to give them the cold shoulder, J. B. is not\r\nthe man for your purpose. Joe is rough and tough, Sir; blunt, Sir,\r\nblunt, is Joe. His Royal Highness the late Duke of York did me the\r\nhonour to say, deservedly or undeservedly\xe2\x80\x94never mind that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98If there is\r\na man in the service on whom I can depend for coming to the point, that\r\nman is Joe\xe2\x80\x94Joe Bagstock.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey intimates his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a man of the world. Our friend\r\nFeenix\xe2\x80\x94if I may presume to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94is,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeds the Major, with a wag of his head, \xe2\x80\x9calso a man of the\r\nworld. Dombey, you are a man of the world. Now, when three men of the\r\nworld meet together, and are friends\xe2\x80\x94as I believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d again appealing to\r\nCousin Feenix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cmost friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and are friends,\xe2\x80\x9d resumes the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Joe\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is (I may be\r\nwrong), that the opinion of the world on any particular subject, is\r\nvery easily got at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix. \xe2\x80\x9cIn point of fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a\r\nself-evident sort of thing. I am extremely anxious, Major, that my\r\nfriend Dombey should hear me express my very great astonishment and\r\nregret, that my lovely and accomplished relative, who was possessed of\r\nevery qualification to make a man happy, should have so far forgotten\r\nwhat was due to\xe2\x80\x94in point of fact, to the world\xe2\x80\x94as to commit herself in\r\nsuch a very extraordinary manner. I have been in a devilish state of\r\ndepression ever since; and said indeed to Long Saxby last night\xe2\x80\x94man of\r\nsix foot ten, with whom my friend Dombey is probably acquainted\xe2\x80\x94that it\r\nhad upset me in a confounded way, and made me bilious. It induces a man\r\nto reflect, this kind of fatal catastrophe,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nevents do occur in quite a providential manner; for if my Aunt had been\r\nliving at the time, I think the effect upon a devilish lively woman\r\nlike herself, would have been prostration, and that she would have\r\nfallen, in point of fact, a victim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Dombey!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, resuming his discourse with great\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposes Cousin Feenix. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me another word.\r\nMy friend Dombey will permit me to say, that if any circumstance could\r\nhave added to the most infernal state of pain in which I find myself on\r\nthis occasion, it would be the natural amazement of the world at my\r\nlovely and accomplished relative (as I must still beg leave to call\r\nher) being supposed to have so committed herself with a person\xe2\x80\x94man with\r\nwhite teeth, in point of fact\xe2\x80\x94of very inferior station to her husband.\r\nBut while I must, rather peremptorily, request my friend Dombey not to\r\ncriminate my lovely and accomplished relative until her criminality is\r\nperfectly established, I beg to assure my friend Dombey that the family\r\nI represent, and which is now almost extinct (devilish sad reflection\r\nfor a man), will interpose no obstacle in his way, and will be happy to\r\nassent to any honourable course of proceeding, with a view to the\r\nfuture, that he may point out. I trust my friend Dombey will give me\r\ncredit for the intentions by which I am animated in this very\r\nmelancholy affair, and\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94in point of fact, I am not aware that I need\r\ntrouble my friend Dombey with any further observations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey bows, without raising his eyes, and is silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cour friend Feenix having, with an\r\namount of eloquence that Old Joe B. has never heard surpassed\xe2\x80\x94no, by\r\nthe Lord, Sir! never!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94says the Major, very blue, indeed, and grasping\r\nhis cane in the middle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstated the case as regards the lady, I shall\r\npresume upon our friendship, Dombey, to offer a word on another aspect\r\nof it. Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, with the horse\xe2\x80\x99s cough, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world in\r\nthese things has opinions, which must be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoins Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you know it, Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir, I know\r\nyou know it. A man of your calibre is not likely to be ignorant of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d replies Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will guess the rest. I speak\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94prematurely, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94because the Bagstock breed have always spoke\r\nout. Little, Sir, have they ever got by doing it; but it\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nBagstock blood. A shot is to be taken at this man. You have J. B. at\r\nyour elbow. He claims the name of friend. God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d returns Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged. I shall put myself in your\r\nhands when the time comes. The time not being come, I have forborne to\r\nspeak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the fellow, Dombey?\xe2\x80\x9d inquires the Major, after gasping and\r\nlooking at him, for a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny intelligence of him?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDombey, I am rejoiced to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Major. \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will excuse\xe2\x80\x94even you, Major,\xe2\x80\x9d replies Mr Dombey, \xe2\x80\x9cmy entering into\r\nany further detail at present. The intelligence is of a singular kind,\r\nand singularly obtained. It may turn out to be valueless; it may turn\r\nout to be true; I cannot say at present. My explanation must stop\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough this is but a dry reply to the Major\xe2\x80\x99s purple enthusiasm, the\r\nMajor receives it graciously, and is delighted to think that the world\r\nhas such a fair prospect of soon receiving its due. Cousin Feenix is\r\nthen presented with his meed of acknowledgment by the husband of his\r\nlovely and accomplished relative, and Cousin Feenix and Major Bagstock\r\nretire, leaving that husband to the world again, and to ponder at\r\nleisure on their representation of its state of mind concerning his\r\naffairs, and on its just and reasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nBut who sits in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, shedding tears, and talking to\r\nMrs Pipchin in a low tone, with uplifted hands? It is a lady with her\r\nface concealed in a very close black bonnet, which appears not to\r\nbelong to her. It is Miss Tox, who has borrowed this disguise from her\r\nservant, and comes from Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, thus secretly, to revive her\r\nold acquaintance with Mrs Pipchin, in order to get certain information\r\nof the state of Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he bear it, my dear creature?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin, in her snappish way, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much as\r\nusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExternally,\xe2\x80\x9d suggests Miss Tox \xe2\x80\x9cBut what he feels within!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s hard grey eye looks doubtful as she answers, in three\r\ndistinct jerks, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Perhaps. I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you my mind, Lucretia,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin; she still calls Miss\r\nTox Lucretia, on account of having made her first experiments in the\r\nchild-quelling line of business on that lady, when an unfortunate and\r\nweazen little girl of tender years; \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you my mind, Lucretia, I\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s a good riddance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of your brazen faces here,\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrazen indeed! Well may you say brazen, Mrs Pipchin!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss\r\nTox. \xe2\x80\x9cTo leave him! Such a noble figure of a man!\xe2\x80\x9d And here Miss Tox is\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about noble, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Mrs Pipchin; irascibly\r\nrubbing her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know this\xe2\x80\x94that when people meet with trials,\r\nthey must bear \xe2\x80\x99em. Hoity, toity! I have had enough to bear myself, in\r\nmy time! What a fuss there is! She\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and well got rid of. Nobody\r\nwants her back, I should think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis hint of the Peruvian Mines, causes Miss Tox to rise to go away;\r\nwhen Mrs Pipchin rings the bell for Towlinson to show her out, Mr\r\nTowlinson, not having seen Miss Tox for ages, grins, and hopes she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwell; observing that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her at first, in that bonnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, Towlinson, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave the goodness, when you happen to see me here, not to mention it.\r\nMy visits are merely to Mrs Pipchin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d says Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShocking circumstances occur, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much so indeed, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoins Towlinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Towlinson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Tox, who, in her instruction of the\r\nToodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and a habit of\r\nimproving passing occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what has happened here, will be a\r\nwarning to you, Towlinson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Towlinson.\r\n\r\nHe appears to be falling into a consideration of the manner in which\r\nthis warning ought to operate in his particular case, when the vinegary\r\nMrs Pipchin, suddenly stirring him up with a \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you show the lady to the door?\xe2\x80\x9d he ushers Miss Tox forth. As she\r\npasses Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s room, she shrinks into the inmost depths of the\r\nblack bonnet, and walks, on tip-toe; and there is not another atom in\r\nthe world which haunts him so, that feels such sorrow and solicitude\r\nabout him, as Miss Tox takes out under the black bonnet into the\r\nstreet, and tries to carry home shadowed it from the newly-lighted\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Tox is not a part of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s world. She comes back every\r\nevening at dusk; adding clogs and an umbrella to the bonnet on wet\r\nnights; and bears the grins of Towlinson, and the huffs and rebuffs of\r\nMrs Pipchin, and all to ask how he does, and how he bears his\r\nmisfortune: but she has nothing to do with Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s world. Exacting\r\nand harassing as ever, it goes on without her; and she, a by no means\r\nbright or particular star, moves in her little orbit in the corner of\r\nanother system, and knows it quite well, and comes, and cries, and goes\r\naway, and is satisfied. Verily Miss Tox is easier of satisfaction than\r\nthe world that troubles Mr Dombey so much!\r\n\r\nAt the Counting House, the clerks discuss the great disaster in all its\r\nlights and shades, but chiefly wonder who will get Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\nThey are generally of opinion that it will be shorn of some of its\r\nemoluments, and made uncomfortable by newly-devised checks and\r\nrestrictions; and those who are beyond all hope of it are quite sure\r\nthey would rather not have it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t at all envy the person for\r\nwhom it may prove to be reserved. Nothing like the prevailing sensation\r\nhas existed in the Counting House since Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s little son died;\r\nbut all such excitements there take a social, not to say a jovial turn,\r\nand lead to the cultivation of good fellowship. A reconciliation is\r\nestablished on this propitious occasion between the acknowledged wit of\r\nthe Counting House and an aspiring rival, with whom he has been at\r\ndeadly feud for months; and a little dinner being proposed, in\r\ncommemoration of their happily restored amity, takes place at a\r\nneighbouring tavern; the wit in the chair; the rival acting as\r\nVice-President. The orations following the removal of the cloth are\r\nopened by the Chair, who says, Gentlemen, he can\xe2\x80\x99t disguise from\r\nhimself that this is not a time for private dissensions. Recent\r\noccurrences to which he need not more particularly allude, but which\r\nhave not been altogether without notice in some Sunday Papers, and in a\r\ndaily paper which he need not name (here every other member of the\r\ncompany names it in an audible murmur), have caused him to reflect; and\r\nhe feels that for him and Robinson to have any personal differences at\r\nsuch a moment, would be for ever to deny that good feeling in the\r\ngeneral cause, for which he has reason to think and hope that the\r\ngentlemen in Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House have always been distinguished. Robinson\r\nreplies to this like a man and a brother; and one gentleman who has\r\nbeen in the office three years, under continual notice to quit on\r\naccount of lapses in his arithmetic, appears in a perfectly new light,\r\nsuddenly bursting out with a thrilling speech, in which he says, May\r\ntheir respected chief never again know the desolation which has fallen\r\non his hearth! and says a great variety of things, beginning with \xe2\x80\x9cMay\r\nhe never again,\xe2\x80\x9d which are received with thunders of applause. In\r\nshort, a most delightful evening is passed, only interrupted by a\r\ndifference between two juniors, who, quarrelling about the probable\r\namount of Mr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s late receipts per annum, defy each other with\r\ndecanters, and are taken out greatly excited. Soda water is in general\r\nrequest at the office next day, and most of the party deem the bill an\r\nimposition.\r\n\r\nAs to Perch, the messenger, he is in a fair way of being ruined for\r\nlife. He finds himself again constantly in bars of public-houses, being\r\ntreated and lying dreadfully. It appears that he met everybody\r\nconcerned in the late transaction, everywhere, and said to them, \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d as the case was, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you look so pale?\xe2\x80\x9d at which each\r\nshuddered from head to foot, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Perch!\xe2\x80\x9d and ran away.\r\nEither the consciousness of these enormities, or the reaction\r\nconsequent on liquor, reduces Mr Perch to an extreme state of low\r\nspirits at that hour of the evening when he usually seeks consolation\r\nin the society of Mrs Perch at Balls Pond; and Mrs Perch frets a good\r\ndeal, for she fears his confidence in woman is shaken now, and that he\r\nhalf expects on coming home at night to find her gone off with some\r\nViscount\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhich,\xe2\x80\x9d as she observes to an intimate female friend, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nwhat these wretches in the form of woman have to answer for, Mrs P. It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t the harm they do themselves so much as what they reflect upon us,\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am; and I see it in Perch\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s servants are becoming, at the same time, quite dissipated,\r\nand unfit for other service. They have hot suppers every night, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctalk it over\xe2\x80\x9d with smoking drinks upon the board. Mr Towlinson is\r\nalways maudlin after half-past ten, and frequently begs to know whether\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that no good would ever come of living in a corner house?\r\nThey whisper about Miss Florence, and wonder where she is; but agree\r\nthat if Mr Dombey don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Mrs Dombey does. This brings them to the\r\nlatter, of whom Cook says, She had a stately way though, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\nBut she was too high! They all agree that she was too high, and Mr\r\nTowlinson\xe2\x80\x99s old flame, the housemaid (who is very virtuous), entreats\r\nthat you will never talk to her any more about people who hold their\r\nheads up, as if the ground wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\nEverything that is said and done about it, except by Mr Dombey, is done\r\nin chorus. Mr Dombey and the world are alone together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nSecret Intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Mrs Brown and her daughter Alice kept silent company together, in\r\ntheir own dwelling. It was early in the evening, and late in the\r\nspring. But a few days had elapsed since Mr Dombey had told Major\r\nBagstock of his singular intelligence, singularly obtained, which might\r\nturn out to be valueless, and might turn out to be true; and the world\r\nwas not satisfied yet.\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter sat for a long time without interchanging a\r\nword: almost without motion. The old woman\xe2\x80\x99s face was shrewdly anxious\r\nand expectant; that of her daughter was expectant too, but in a less\r\nsharp degree, and sometimes it darkened, as if with gathering\r\ndisappointment and incredulity. The old woman, without heeding these\r\nchanges in its expression, though her eyes were often turned towards\r\nit, sat mumbling and munching, and listening confidently.\r\n\r\nTheir abode, though poor and miserable, was not so utterly wretched as\r\nin the days when only Good Mrs Brown inhabited it. Some few attempts at\r\ncleanliness and order were manifest, though made in a reckless, gipsy\r\nway, that might have connected them, at a glance, with the younger\r\nwoman. The shades of evening thickened and deepened as the two kept\r\nsilence, until the blackened walls were nearly lost in the prevailing\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nThen Alice broke the silence which had lasted so long, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may give him up, mother. He\xe2\x80\x99ll not come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old woman, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will come\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd doomsday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I\xe2\x80\x99m in my second childhood, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the old woman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the respect and duty that I get from my own gal, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wiser\r\nthan you take me for. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come. T\xe2\x80\x99other day when I touched his coat\r\nin the street, he looked round as if I was a toad. But Lord, to see him\r\nwhen I said their names, and asked him if he\xe2\x80\x99d like to find out where\r\nthey was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it so angry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her daughter, roused to interest in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry? ask if it was bloody. That\xe2\x80\x99s more like the word. Angry? Ha, ha!\r\nTo call that only angry!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, hobbling to the cupboard,\r\nand lighting a candle, which displayed the workings of her mouth to\r\nugly advantage, as she brought it to the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well call\r\nyour face only angry, when you think or talk about \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was something different from that, truly, as she sat as still as a\r\ncrouched tigress, with her kindling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear a step coming. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the tread of anyone that lives about here, or comes this way often.\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t walk like that. We should grow proud on such neighbours! Do\r\nyou hear him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are right, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Alice, in a low voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she drew herself within her shawl, and gathered it about her, the\r\nold woman complied; and peering out, and beckoning, gave admission to\r\nMr Dombey, who stopped when he had set his foot within the door, and\r\nlooked distrustfully around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a poor place for a great gentleman like your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold woman, curtseying and chattering. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nharm in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Dombey, looking at her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my handsome daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cYour worship won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind her. She knows all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shadow fell upon his face not less expressive than if he had groaned\r\naloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWho does not know all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d but he looked at her steadily,\r\nand she, without any acknowledgment of his presence, looked at him. The\r\nshadow on his face was darker when he turned his glance away from her;\r\nand even then it wandered back again, furtively, as if he were haunted\r\nby her bold eyes, and some remembrance they inspired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey to the old witch who was chuckling and leering\r\nclose at his elbow, and who, when he turned to address her, pointed\r\nstealthily at her daughter, and rubbed her hands, and pointed again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman! I believe that I am weak and forgetful of my station in coming\r\nhere, but you know why I come, and what you offered when you stopped me\r\nin the street the other day. What is it that you have to tell me\r\nconcerning what I want to know; and how does it happen that I can find\r\nvoluntary intelligence in a hovel like this,\xe2\x80\x9d with a disdainful glance\r\nabout him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I have exerted my power and means to obtain it in\r\nvain? I do not think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, during which he\r\nhad observed her, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are so audacious as to mean to\r\ntrifle with me, or endeavour to impose upon me. But if you have that\r\npurpose, you had better stop on the threshold of your scheme. My humour\r\nis not a trifling one, and my acknowledgment will be severe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh a proud, hard gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the old woman, shaking her head,\r\nand rubbing her shrivelled hands, \xe2\x80\x9coh hard, hard, hard! But your\r\nworship shall see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears; not\r\nwith ours\xe2\x80\x94and if your worship\xe2\x80\x99s put upon their track, you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\npaying something for it, will you, honourable deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Dombey, apparently relieved, and assured by this\r\ninquiry, \xe2\x80\x9cwill bring about unlikely things, I know. It may turn even\r\nmeans as unexpected and unpromising as these, to account. Yes. For any\r\nreliable information I receive, I will pay. But I must have the\r\ninformation first, and judge for myself of its value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know nothing more powerful than money?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the younger\r\nwoman, without rising, or altering her attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here, I should imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should know of something that is more powerful elsewhere, as I\r\njudge,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know nothing of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s anger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a saucy tongue, Jade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot usually,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, without any show of emotion: \xe2\x80\x9cI speak to\r\nyou now, that you may understand us better, and rely more on us. A\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s anger is pretty much the same here, as in your fine house. I am\r\nangry. I have been so, many years. I have as good cause for my anger as\r\nyou have for yours, and its object is the same man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started, in spite of himself, and looked at her with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a kind of laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWide as the distance may seem\r\nbetween us, it is so. How it is so, is no matter; that is my story, and\r\nI keep my story to myself. I would bring you and him together, because\r\nI have a rage against him. My mother there, is avaricious and poor; and\r\nshe would sell any tidings she could glean, or anything, or anybody,\r\nfor money. It is fair enough, perhaps, that you should pay her some, if\r\nshe can help you to what you want to know. But that is not my motive. I\r\nhave told you what mine is, and it would be as strong and\r\nall-sufficient with me if you haggled and bargained with her for a\r\nsixpence. I have done. My saucy tongue says no more, if you wait here\r\ntill sunrise tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, who had shown great uneasiness during this speech, which\r\nhad a tendency to depreciate her expected gains, pulled Mr Dombey\r\nsoftly by the sleeve, and whispered to him not to mind her. He glared\r\nat them both, by turns, with a haggard look, and said, in a deeper\r\nvoice than was usual with him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94what do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not so fast, your worship! we must wait for someone,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nold woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to be got from someone else\xe2\x80\x94wormed out\xe2\x80\x94screwed and\r\ntwisted from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Dombey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience,\xe2\x80\x9d she croaked, laying her hand, like a claw, upon his arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get at it. I know I can! If he was to hold it back from\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Good Mrs Brown, crooking her ten fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d tear it out of\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey followed her with his eyes as she hobbled to the door, and\r\nlooked out again: and then his glance sought her daughter; but she\r\nremained impassive, silent, and regardless of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you tell me, woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the bent figure of Mrs Brown\r\ncame back, shaking its head and chattering to itself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is\r\nanother person expected here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, looking up into his face, and nodding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, nodding again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChut!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, with a shrill laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat signifies! Well,\r\nwell; no. No stranger to your worship. But he won\xe2\x80\x99t see you. He\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nafraid of you, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stand behind that door, and\r\njudge him for yourself. We don\xe2\x80\x99t ask to be believed on trust What! Your\r\nworship doubts the room behind the door? Oh the suspicion of you rich\r\ngentlefolks! Look at it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sharp eye had detected an involuntary expression of this feeling on\r\nhis part, which was not unreasonable under the circumstances. In\r\nsatisfaction of it she now took the candle to the door she spoke of. Mr\r\nDombey looked in; assured himself that it was an empty, crazy room; and\r\nsigned to her to put the light back in its place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore this person comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWould your worship sit down for a few odd\r\nminutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer; but began pacing the room with an irresolute air, as\r\nif he were undecided whether to remain or depart, and as if he had some\r\nquarrel with himself for being there at all. But soon his tread grew\r\nslower and heavier, and his face more sternly thoughtful; as the object\r\nwith which he had come, fixed itself in his mind, and dilated there\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground, Mrs\r\nBrown, in the chair from which she had risen to receive him, sat\r\nlistening anew. The monotony of his step, or the uncertainty of age,\r\nmade her so slow of hearing, that a footfall without had sounded in her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s ears for some moments, and she had looked up hastily to warn\r\nher mother of its approach, before the old woman was roused by it. But\r\nthen she started from her seat, and whispering \xe2\x80\x9cHere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d hurried\r\nher visitor to his place of observation, and put a bottle and glass\r\nupon the table, with such alacrity, as to be ready to fling her arms\r\nround the neck of Rob the Grinder on his appearance at the door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s my bonny boy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Brown, \xe2\x80\x9cat last!\xe2\x80\x94oho, oho! You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlike my own son, Robby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you be fond\r\nof a cove without squeedging and throttling of him? Take care of the\r\nbirdcage in my hand, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinks of a birdcage, afore me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, apostrophizing\r\nthe ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cMe that feels more than a mother for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nunfortunate youth, greatly aggravated; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99re so jealous of a\r\ncove. I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of you myself, and all that, of course; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsmother you, do I, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked and spoke as if he would have been far from objecting to do\r\nso, however, on a favourable occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to talk about birdcages, too!\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if that\r\nwas a crime! Why, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here! Do you know who this belongs to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Master, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman with a grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Grinder, lifting a large cage tied up in a wrapper,\r\non the table, and untying it with his teeth and hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s our\r\nparrot, this is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Carker\xe2\x80\x99s parrot, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hold your tongue, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the goaded Grinder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you go naming names for? I\xe2\x80\x99m blest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, pulling his\r\nhair with both hands in the exasperation of his feelings, \xe2\x80\x9cif she ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough to make a cove run wild!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Do you snub me, thankless boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, with ready\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Misses Brown, no!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder, with tears in\r\nhis eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a\xe2\x80\x94! Don\xe2\x80\x99t I dote upon you, Misses\r\nBrown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, sweet Rob? Do you truly, chickabiddy?\xe2\x80\x9d With that, Mrs Brown\r\nheld him in her fond embrace once more; and did not release him until\r\nhe had made several violent and ineffectual struggles with his legs,\r\nand his hair was standing on end all over his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a thing it is to be perfectly pitched\r\ninto with affection like this here. I wish she was\xe2\x80\x94How have you been,\r\nMisses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Not here since this night week!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, contemplating\r\nhim with a look of reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cI said tonight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na week, that I\xe2\x80\x99d come tonight, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? And here I am. How you do go\r\non! I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d be a little rational, Misses Brown. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoarse with\r\nsaying things in my defence, and my very face is shiny with being\r\nhugged!\xe2\x80\x9d He rubbed it hard with his sleeve, as if to remove the tender\r\npolish in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink a little drop to comfort you, my Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman,\r\nfilling the glass from the bottle and giving it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your health.\r\nAnd long may you\xe2\x80\x94et ceterer.\xe2\x80\x9d Which, to judge from the expression of\r\nhis face, did not include any very choice blessings. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nhealth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, glancing at Alice, who sat with her eyes\r\nfixed, as it seemed to him, on the wall behind him, but in reality on\r\nMr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cand wishing her the same and many of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drained the glass to these two sentiments, and set it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I say, Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cTo go on a little rational\r\nnow. You\xe2\x80\x99re a judge of birds, and up to their ways, as I know to my\r\ncost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCost!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatisfaction, I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you do take up a\r\ncove, Misses Brown! You\xe2\x80\x99ve put it all out of my head again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge of birds, Robby,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take care of this\r\nparrot\xe2\x80\x94certain things being sold, and a certain establishment broke\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94and as I don\xe2\x80\x99t want no notice took at present, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d attend\r\nto her for a week or so, and give her board and lodging, will you? If I\r\nmust come backwards and forwards,\xe2\x80\x9d mused the Grinder with a dejected\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cI may as well have something to come for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to come for?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides you, I mean, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the craven Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that\r\nI want any inducement but yourself, Misses Brown, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Don\xe2\x80\x99t begin\r\nagain, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me! He don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me, as I care for him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMrs Brown, lifting up her skinny hands. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of his\r\nbird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake good care of it too, you know, Mrs Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, shaking his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you was so much as to stroke its feathers once the wrong way,\r\nI believe it would be found out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, so sharp as that, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSharp, Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is not to be talked\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChecking himself abruptly, and not without a fearful glance across the\r\nroom, Rob filled the glass again, and having slowly emptied it, shook\r\nhis head, and began to draw his fingers across and across the wires of\r\nthe parrot\xe2\x80\x99s cage by way of a diversion from the dangerous theme that\r\nhad just been broached.\r\n\r\nThe old woman eyed him slily, and hitching her chair nearer his, and\r\nlooking in at the parrot, who came down from the gilded dome at her\r\ncall, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of place now, Robby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoard wages, perhaps, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty Polly!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder.\r\n\r\nThe old woman darted a glance at him that might have warned him to\r\nconsider his ears in danger, but it was his turn to look in at the\r\nparrot now, and however expressive his imagination may have made her\r\nangry scowl, it was unseen by his bodily eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder Master didn\xe2\x80\x99t take you with him, Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, in\r\na wheedling voice, but with increased malignity of aspect.\r\n\r\nRob was so absorbed in contemplation of the parrot, and in trolling his\r\nforefinger on the wires, that he made no answer.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had her clutch within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of his shock of\r\nhair as it stooped over the table; but she restrained her fingers, and\r\nsaid, in a voice that choked with its efforts to be coaxing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobby, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say I wonder Master didn\xe2\x80\x99t take you with him, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder.\r\n\r\nMrs Brown instantly directed the clutch of her right hand at his hair,\r\nand the clutch of her left hand at his throat, and held on to the\r\nobject of her fond affection with such extraordinary fury, that his\r\nface began to blacken in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9clet go, will you? What are you\r\ndoing of? Help, young woman! Misses Brow\xe2\x80\x94Brow\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman, however, equally unmoved by his direct appeal to her,\r\nand by his inarticulate utterance, remained quite neutral, until, after\r\nstruggling with his assailant into a corner, Rob disengaged himself,\r\nand stood there panting and fenced in by his own elbows, while the old\r\nwoman, panting too, and stamping with rage and eagerness, appeared to\r\nbe collecting her energies for another swoop upon him. At this crisis\r\nAlice interposed her voice, but not in the Grinder\xe2\x80\x99s favour, by saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, mother. Tear him to pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, young woman!\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered Rob; \xe2\x80\x9care you against me too? What have\r\nI been and done? What am I to be tore to pieces for, I should like to\r\nknow? Why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm,\r\nneither of you? Call yourselves females, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said the frightened and\r\nafflicted Grinder, with his coat-cuff at his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at\r\nyou! Where\xe2\x80\x99s your feminine tenderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thankless dog!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mrs Brown. \xe2\x80\x9cYou impudent insulting dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I been and done to go and give you offence, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nretorted the fearful Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cYou was very much attached to me a minute\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cut me off with his short answers and his sulky words,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold woman. \xe2\x80\x9cMe! Because I happen to be curious to have a little bit of\r\ngossip about Master and the lady, to dare to play at fast and loose\r\nwith me! But I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you no more, my lad. Now go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the abject Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\ninsiniwated that I wished to go. Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that, Misses Brown, if\r\nyou please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t talk at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, with an action of her crooked\r\nfingers that made him shrink into half his natural compass in the\r\ncorner. \xe2\x80\x9cNot another word with him shall pass my lips. He\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nungrateful hound. I cast him off. Now let him go! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll slip those\r\nafter him that shall talk too much; that won\xe2\x80\x99t be shook away; that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhang to him like leeches, and slink arter him like foxes. What! He\r\nknows \xe2\x80\x99em. He knows his old games and his old ways. If he\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, they\xe2\x80\x99ll soon remind him. Now let him go, and see how he\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s business, and keep Master\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, with such company always\r\nfollowing him up and down. Ha, ha, ha! He\xe2\x80\x99ll find \xe2\x80\x99em a different sort\r\nfrom you and me, Ally; Close as he is with you and me. Now let him go,\r\nnow let him go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, to the unspeakable dismay of the Grinder, walked her\r\ntwisted figure round and round, in a ring of some four feet in\r\ndiameter, constantly repeating these words, and shaking her fist above\r\nher head, and working her mouth about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Rob, coming a little out of his corner, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t injure a cove, on second thoughts, and in cold blood,\r\nwould you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, still wrathfully pursuing her\r\ncircle. \xe2\x80\x9cNow let him go, now let him go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the tormented Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\xe2\x80\x94Oh, what\r\na thing it is for a cove to get into such a line as this!\xe2\x80\x94I was only\r\ncareful of talking, Misses Brown, because I always am, on account of\r\nhis being up to everything; but I might have known it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ngone any further. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m quite agreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d with a wretched face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor any little bit of gossip, Misses Brown. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this, if\r\nyou please. Oh, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have the goodness to put in a word for a\r\nmiserable cove, here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, appealing in desperation to\r\nthe daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, mother, you hear what he says,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, in her stern\r\nvoice, and with an impatient action of her head; \xe2\x80\x9ctry him once more,\r\nand if you fall out with him again, ruin him, if you like, and have\r\ndone with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Brown, moved as it seemed by this very tender exhortation,\r\npresently began to howl; and softening by degrees, took the apologetic\r\nGrinder to her arms, who embraced her with a face of unutterable woe,\r\nand like a victim as he was, resumed his former seat, close by the side\r\nof his venerable friend, whom he suffered, not without much constrained\r\nsweetness of countenance, combating very expressive physiognomical\r\nrevelations of an opposite character to draw his arm through hers, and\r\nkeep it there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s Master, deary dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, when, sitting in this\r\namicable posture, they had pledged each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! If you\xe2\x80\x99d be so good, Misses Brown, as to speak a little lower,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRob implored. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not out of place, Robby?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown, in a wheedling tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly out of place, nor in,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m still\r\nin pay, Misses Brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing to do, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing particular to do just now, Misses Brown, but to\xe2\x80\x94keep my eyes\r\nopen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, rolling them in a forlorn way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster abroad, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Misses Brown, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you gossip with a cove\r\nabout anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Grinder, in a burst of despair.\r\n\r\nThe impetuous Mrs Brown rising directly, the tortured Grinder detained\r\nher, stammering \xe2\x80\x9cYe-es, Misses Brown, I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s abroad. What\xe2\x80\x99s she\r\nstaring at?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in allusion to the daughter, whose eyes were\r\nfixed upon the face that now again looked out behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind her, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, holding him closer to\r\nprevent his turning round. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s her way\xe2\x80\x94her way. Tell me, Rob. Did you\r\never see the lady, deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Misses Brown, what lady?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Grinder in a tone of piteous\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat lady?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady; Mrs Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe I see her once,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night she went away, Robby, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman in his ear,\r\nand taking note of every change in his face. \xe2\x80\x9cAha! I know it was that\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you know it was that night, you know, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nRob, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use putting pinchers into a cove to make him say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they go that night, Rob? Straight away? How did they go?\r\nWhere did you see her? Did she laugh? Did she cry? Tell me all about\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old hag, holding him closer yet, patting the hand that\r\nwas drawn through his arm against her other hand, and searching every\r\nline in his face with her bleared eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! Begin! I want to be told\r\nall about it. What, Rob, boy! You and me can keep a secret together,\r\neh? We\xe2\x80\x99ve done so before now. Where did they go first, Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wretched Grinder made a gasp, and a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you dumb?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Misses Brown, no! You expect a cove to be a flash of lightning.\r\nI wish I was the electric fluency,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the bewildered Grinder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have a shock at somebody, that would settle their business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wishing my love to you, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the false Rob,\r\nseeking consolation in the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they go to first was it?\r\nHim and her, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThem two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go nowhere\xe2\x80\x94not together, I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob.\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked at him, as though she had a strong impulse upon\r\nher to make another clutch at his head and throat, but was restrained\r\nby a certain dogged mystery in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the art of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reluctant Grinder; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way\r\nnobody saw \xe2\x80\x99em go, or has been able to say how they did go. They went\r\ndifferent ways, I tell you Misses Brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, ay! To meet at an appointed place,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the old woman,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silent and keen scrutiny of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t a going to meet somewhere, I suppose they might\r\nas well have stayed at home, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t they, Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nunwilling Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Rob? Well?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, drawing his arm yet tighter\r\nthrough her own, as if, in her eagerness, she were afraid of his\r\nslipping away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we talked enough yet, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nGrinder, who, between his sense of injury, his sense of liquor, and his\r\nsense of being on the rack, had become so lachrymose, that at almost\r\nevery answer he scooped his coats into one or other of his eyes, and\r\nuttered an unavailing whine of remonstrance. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she laugh that night,\r\nwas it? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask if she laughed, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr cried?\xe2\x80\x9d added the old woman, nodding assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cShe kept as steady when she and me\xe2\x80\x94oh, I\r\nsee you will have it out of me, Misses Brown! But take your solemn oath\r\nnow, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll never tell anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Mrs Brown very readily did: being naturally Jesuitical; and having\r\nno other intention in the matter than that her concealed visitor should\r\nhear for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe kept as steady, then, when she and me went down to Southampton,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cas a image. In the morning she was just the same,\r\nMisses Brown. And when she went away in the packet before daylight, by\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94me pretending to be her servant, and seeing her safe aboard\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas just the same. Now, are you contented, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Rob. Not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs Brown, decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, here\xe2\x80\x99s a woman for you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the unfortunate Rob, in an outburst\r\nof feeble lamentation over his own helplessness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you wish to\r\nknow next, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat became of Master? Where did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, still holding\r\nhim tight, and looking close into his face, with her sharp eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he did, nor where he went, nor anything about him I\r\nonly know what he said to me as a caution to hold my tongue, when we\r\nparted; and I tell you this, Misses Brown, as a friend, that sooner\r\nthan ever repeat a word of what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying now, you had better take\r\nand shoot yourself, or shut yourself up in this house, and set it\r\na-fire, for there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, to be revenged upon you.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know him half as well as I do, Misses Brown. You\xe2\x80\x99re never\r\nsafe from him, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I taken an oath,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cand won\xe2\x80\x99t I keep\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope you will, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rob, somewhat\r\ndoubtfully, and not without a latent threatening in his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nyour own sake, quite as much as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as he gave her this friendly caution, and emphasized\r\nit with a nodding of his head; but finding it uncomfortable to\r\nencounter the yellow face with its grotesque action, and the ferret\r\neyes with their keen old wintry gaze, so close to his own, he looked\r\ndown uneasily and sat skulking in his chair, as if he were trying to\r\nbring himself to a sullen declaration that he would answer no more\r\nquestions. The old woman, still holding him as before, took this\r\nopportunity of raising the forefinger of her right hand, in the air, as\r\na stealthy signal to the concealed observer to give particular\r\nattention to what was about to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her most coaxing tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Misses Brown, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nexasperated Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob! where did the lady and Master appoint to meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob shuffled more and more, and looked up and looked down, and bit his\r\nthumb, and dried it on his waistcoat, and finally said, eyeing his\r\ntormentor askance, \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman held up her finger again, as before, and replying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nlad! It\xe2\x80\x99s no use leading me to that, and there leaving me. I want to\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x9d waited for his answer. Rob, after a discomfited pause, suddenly\r\nbroke out with, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I pronounce the names of foreign places, Mrs\r\nBrown? What an unreasonable woman you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have heard it said, Robby,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cand you know\r\nwhat it sounded like. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard it said, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the old woman quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have seen it written, and\r\nyou can spell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob, with a petulant exclamation between laughing and crying\xe2\x80\x94for he was\r\npenetrated with some admiration of Mrs Brown\xe2\x80\x99s cunning, even through\r\nthis persecution\xe2\x80\x94after some reluctant fumbling in his waistcoat pocket,\r\nproduced from it a little piece of chalk. The old woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled\r\nwhen she saw it between his thumb and finger, and hastily clearing a\r\nspace on the deal table, that he might write the word there, she once\r\nmore made her signal with a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I tell you beforehand what it is, Misses Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno use asking me anything else. I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer anything else; I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nHow long it was to be before they met, or whose plan it was that they\r\nwas to go away alone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know no more than you do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nany more about it. If I was to tell you how I found out this word,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d believe that. Shall I tell you, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Rob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Misses Brown. The way\xe2\x80\x94now you won\xe2\x80\x99t ask any more, you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, turning his eyes, which were now fast getting drowsy\r\nand stupid, upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot another word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, the way was this. When a certain person left the lady with\r\nme, he put a piece of paper with a direction written on it in the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s hand, saying it was in case she should forget. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid\r\nof forgetting, for she tore it up as soon as his back was turned, and\r\nwhen I put up the carriage steps, I shook out one of the pieces\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nsprinkled the rest out of the window, I suppose, for there was none\r\nthere afterwards, though I looked for \xe2\x80\x99em. There was only one word on\r\nit, and that was this, if you must and will know. But remember! You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nupon your oath, Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Brown knew that, she said. Rob, having nothing more to say, began\r\nto chalk, slowly and laboriously, on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98D,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman read aloud, when he had formed the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hold your tongue, Misses Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, covering it\r\nwith his hand, and turning impatiently upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it read\r\nout. Be quiet, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen write large, Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, repeating her secret signal;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor my eyes are not good, even at print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuttering to himself, and returning to his work with an ill will, Rob\r\nwent on with the word. As he bent his head down, the person for whose\r\ninformation he so unconsciously laboured, moved from the door behind\r\nhim to within a short stride of his shoulder, and looked eagerly\r\ntowards the creeping track of his hand upon the table. At the same\r\ntime, Alice, from her opposite chair, watched it narrowly as it shaped\r\nthe letters, and repeated each one on her lips as he made it, without\r\narticulating it aloud. At the end of every letter her eyes and Mr\r\nDombey\xe2\x80\x99s met, as if each of them sought to be confirmed by the other;\r\nand thus they both spelt D.I.J.O.N.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, moistening the palm of his hand hastily, to\r\nobliterate the word; and not content with smearing it out, rubbing and\r\nplaning all trace of it away with his coat-sleeve, until the very\r\ncolour of the chalk was gone from the table. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncontented, Misses Brown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, in token of her being so, released his arm and patted\r\nhis back; and the Grinder, overcome with mortification,\r\ncross-examination, and liquor, folded his arms on the table, laid his\r\nhead upon them, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNot until he had been heavily asleep some time, and was snoring\r\nroundly, did the old woman turn towards the door where Mr Dombey stood\r\nconcealed, and beckon him to come through the room, and pass out. Even\r\nthen, she hovered over Rob, ready to blind him with her hands, or\r\nstrike his head down, if he should raise it while the secret step was\r\ncrossing to the door. But though her glance took sharp cognizance of\r\nthe sleeper, it was sharp too for the waking man; and when he touched\r\nher hand with his, and in spite of all his caution, made a chinking,\r\ngolden sound, it was as bright and greedy as a raven\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe daughter\xe2\x80\x99s dark gaze followed him to the door, and noted well how\r\npale he was, and how his hurried tread indicated that the least delay\r\nwas an insupportable restraint upon him, and how he was burning to be\r\nactive and away. As he closed the door behind him, she looked round at\r\nher mother. The old woman trotted to her; opened her hand to show what\r\nwas within; and, tightly closing it again in her jealousy and avarice,\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he do, Ally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMischief,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a madman, in his wounded pride, and may do that, for anything we\r\ncan say, or he either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer glance was brighter than her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, and the fire that shone in\r\nit was fiercer; but her face was colourless, even to her lips.\r\n\r\nThey said no more, but sat apart; the mother communing with her money;\r\nthe daughter with her thoughts; the glance of each, shining in the\r\ngloom of the feebly lighted room. Rob slept and snored. The disregarded\r\nparrot only was in action. It twisted and pulled at the wires of its\r\ncage, with its crooked beak, and crawled up to the dome, and along its\r\nroof like a fly, and down again head foremost, and shook, and bit, and\r\nrattled at every slender bar, as if it knew its master\xe2\x80\x99s danger, and\r\nwas wild to force a passage out, and fly away to warn him of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nMore Intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two of the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s own blood\xe2\x80\x94his renounced brother and\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94on whom the weight of his guilt rested almost more heavily, at\r\nthis time, than on the man whom he had so deeply injured. Prying and\r\ntormenting as the world was, it did Mr Dombey the service of nerving\r\nhim to pursuit and revenge. It roused his passion, stung his pride,\r\ntwisted the one idea of his life into a new shape, and made some\r\ngratification of his wrath, the object into which his whole\r\nintellectual existence resolved itself. All the stubbornness and\r\nimplacability of his nature, all its hard impenetrable quality, all its\r\ngloom and moroseness, all its exaggerated sense of personal importance,\r\nall its jealous disposition to resent the least flaw in the ample\r\nrecognition of his importance by others, set this way like many streams\r\nunited into one, and bore him on upon their tide. The most impetuously\r\npassionate and violently impulsive of mankind would have been a milder\r\nenemy to encounter than the sullen Mr Dombey wrought to this. A wild\r\nbeast would have been easier turned or soothed than the grave gentleman\r\nwithout a wrinkle in his starched cravat.\r\n\r\nBut the very intensity of his purpose became almost a substitute for\r\naction in it. While he was yet uninformed of the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, it\r\nserved to divert his mind from his own calamity, and to entertain it\r\nwith another prospect. The brother and sister of his false favourite\r\nhad no such relief; everything in their history, past and present, gave\r\nhis delinquency a more afflicting meaning to them.\r\n\r\nThe sister may have sometimes sadly thought that if she had remained\r\nwith him, the companion and friend she had been once, he might have\r\nescaped the crime into which he had fallen. If she ever thought so, it\r\nwas still without regret for what she had done, without the least doubt\r\nof her duty, without any pricing or enhancing of her self-devotion. But\r\nwhen this possibility presented itself to the erring and repentant\r\nbrother, as it sometimes did, it smote upon his heart with such a keen,\r\nreproachful touch as he could hardly bear. No idea of retort upon his\r\ncruel brother came into his mind. New accusation of himself, fresh\r\ninward lamentings over his own unworthiness, and the ruin in which it\r\nwas at once his consolation and his self-reproach that he did not stand\r\nalone, were the sole kind of reflections to which the discovery gave\r\nrise in him.\r\n\r\nIt was on the very same day whose evening set upon the last chapter,\r\nand when Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s world was busiest with the elopement of his wife,\r\nthat the window of the room in which the brother and sister sat at\r\ntheir early breakfast, was darkened by the unexpected shadow of a man\r\ncoming to the little porch: which man was Perch the Messenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stepped over from Balls Pond at a early hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch,\r\nconfidentially looking in at the room door, and stopping on the mat to\r\nwipe his shoes all round, which had no mud upon them, \xe2\x80\x9cagreeable to my\r\ninstructions last night. They was, to be sure and bring a note to you,\r\nMr Carker, before you went out in the morning. I should have been here\r\na good hour and a half ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, meekly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for the state\r\nof health of Mrs P., who I thought I should have lost in the night, I\r\ndo assure you, five distinct times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your wife so ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, first turning round to shut the door\r\ncarefully, \xe2\x80\x9cshe takes what has happened in our House so much to heart,\r\nMiss. Her nerves is so very delicate, you see, and soon unstrung. Not\r\nbut what the strongest nerves had good need to be shook, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. You\r\nfeel it very much yourself, no doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet repressed a sigh, and glanced at her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I feel it myself, in my humble way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Perch went on to say,\r\nwith a shake of his head, \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed if I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been called upon to undergo. It has almost the effect of drink\r\nupon me. I literally feels every morning as if I had been taking more\r\nthan was good for me over-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch\xe2\x80\x99s appearance corroborated this recital of his symptoms. There\r\nwas an air of feverish lassitude about it, that seemed referable to\r\ndrams; and, which, in fact, might no doubt have been traced to those\r\nnumerous discoveries of himself in the bars of public-houses, being\r\ntreated and questioned, which he was in the daily habit of making.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore I can judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, shaking his head and speaking\r\nin a silvery murmur, \xe2\x80\x9cof the feelings of such as is at all peculiarly\r\nsitiwated in this most painful rewelation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr Perch waited to be confided in; and receiving no confidence,\r\ncoughed behind his hand. This leading to nothing, he coughed behind his\r\nhat; and that leading to nothing, he put his hat on the ground and\r\nsought in his breast pocket for the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I rightly recollect, there was no answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, with an\r\naffable smile; \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as cast your eye over it,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Carker broke the seal, which was Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s, and possessing\r\nhimself of the contents, which were very brief, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. No answer\r\nis expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall wish you good morning, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perch, taking a step\r\ntoward the door, and hoping, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll not permit yourself\r\nto be more reduced in mind than you can help, by the late painful\r\nrewelation. The Papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Perch, taking two steps back again,\r\nand comprehensively addressing both the brother and sister in a whisper\r\nof increased mystery, \xe2\x80\x9cis more eager for news of it than you\xe2\x80\x99d suppose\r\npossible. One of the Sunday ones, in a blue cloak and a white hat, that\r\nhad previously offered for to bribe me\xe2\x80\x94need I say with what\r\nsuccess?\xe2\x80\x94was dodging about our court last night as late as twenty\r\nminutes after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I see him myself, with his eye at the\r\ncounting-house keyhole, which being patent is impervious. Another one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Perch, \xe2\x80\x9cwith military frogs, is in the parlour of the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArms all the blessed day. I happened, last week, to let a little\r\nobserwation fall there, and next morning, which was Sunday, I see it\r\nworked up in print, in a most surprising manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Perch resorted to his breast pocket, as if to produce the paragraph\r\nbut receiving no encouragement, pulled out his beaver gloves, picked up\r\nhis hat, and took his leave; and before it was high noon, Mr Perch had\r\nrelated to several select audiences at the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms and elsewhere,\r\nhow Miss Carker, bursting into tears, had caught him by both hands, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear dear Perch, the sight of you is all the comfort I have\r\nleft!\xe2\x80\x9d and how Mr John Carker had said, in an awful voice, \xe2\x80\x9cPerch, I\r\ndisown him. Never let me hear him mentioned as a brother more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, when they were left alone, and had remained\r\nsilent for some few moments. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are bad tidings in that letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But nothing unexpected,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the writer\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe writer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Dombey. He passed twice through the Counting House while I was\r\nthere. I had been able to avoid him before, but of course could not\r\nhope to do that long. I know how natural it was that he should regard\r\nmy presence as something offensive; I felt it must be so, myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he said nothing: but I saw that his glance rested on me for a\r\nmoment, and I was prepared for what would happen\xe2\x80\x94for what has happened.\r\nI am dismissed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could, but it was\r\ndistressing news, for many reasons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I need not tell you,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker, reading the letter, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98why\r\nyour name would henceforth have an unnatural sound, in however remote a\r\nconnexion with mine, or why the daily sight of anyone who bears it,\r\nwould be unendurable to me. I have to notify the cessation of all\r\nengagements between us, from this date, and to request that no renewal\r\nof any communication with me, or my establishment, be ever attempted by\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Enclosed is an equivalent in money to a generously long notice,\r\nand this is my discharge. Heaven knows, Harriet, it is a lenient and\r\nconsiderate one, when we remember all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be lenient and considerate to punish you at all, John, for the\r\nmisdeed of another,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied gently, \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been an ill-omened race to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\nreason to shrink from the sound of our name, and to think that there is\r\nsomething cursed and wicked in our blood. I should almost think it too,\r\nHarriet, but for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like this. If you have any special reason, as you\r\nsay you have, and think you have\xe2\x80\x94though I say, No!\xe2\x80\x94to love me, spare me\r\nthe hearing of such wild mad words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe covered his face with both his hands; but soon permitted her, coming\r\nnear him, to take one in her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter so many years, this parting is a melancholy thing, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhis sister, \xe2\x80\x9cand the cause of it is dreadful to us both. We have to\r\nlive, too, and must look about us for the means. Well, well! We can do\r\nso, undismayed. It is our pride, not our trouble, to strive, John, and\r\nto strive together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smile played on her lips, as she kissed his cheek, and entreated him\r\nto be of good cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dearest sister! Tied, of your own noble will, to a ruined man!\r\nwhose reputation is blighted; who has no friend himself, and has driven\r\nevery friend of yours away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn!\xe2\x80\x9d she laid her hand hastily upon his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my sake! In\r\nremembrance of our long companionship!\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let me tell\r\nyou, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly sitting by his side, \xe2\x80\x9cI have, as you have, expected\r\nthis; and when I have been thinking of it, and fearing that it would\r\nhappen, and preparing myself for it, as well as I could, I have\r\nresolved to tell you, if it should be so, that I have kept a secret\r\nfrom you, and that we have a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s our friend\xe2\x80\x99s name, Harriet?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a sorrowful\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but he once made a very earnest protestation to\r\nme of his friendship and his wish to serve us: and to this day I\r\nbelieve him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her wondering brother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere does this friend\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he knows us both, and our\r\nhistory\xe2\x80\x94all our little history, John. That is the reason why, at his\r\nown suggestion, I have kept the secret of his coming, here, from you,\r\nlest his acquaintance with it should distress you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Has he been here, Harriet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in this room. Once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot young. \xe2\x80\x98Grey-headed,\xe2\x80\x99 as he said, \xe2\x80\x98and fast growing greyer.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\ngenerous, and frank, and good, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only seen once, Harriet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this room only once,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister, with the slightest and most\r\ntransient glow upon her cheek; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when here, he entreated me to\r\nsuffer him to see me once a week as he passed by, in token of our being\r\nwell, and continuing to need nothing at his hands. For I told him, when\r\nhe proffered us any service he could render\xe2\x80\x94which was the object of his\r\nvisit\xe2\x80\x94that we needed nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd once a week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce every week since then, and always on the same day, and at the\r\nsame hour, he his gone past; always on foot; always going in the same\r\ndirection\xe2\x80\x94towards London; and never pausing longer than to bow to me,\r\nand wave his hand cheerfully, as a kind guardian might. He made that\r\npromise when he proposed these curious interviews, and has kept it so\r\nfaithfully and pleasantly, that if I ever felt any trifling uneasiness\r\nabout them in the beginning (which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I did, John; his\r\nmanner was so plain and true) it very soon vanished, and left me quite\r\nglad when the day was coming. Last Monday\xe2\x80\x94the first since this terrible\r\nevent\xe2\x80\x94he did not go by; and I have wondered whether his absence can\r\nhave been in any way connected with what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. I have only speculated on the coincidence; I have\r\nnot tried to account for it. I feel sure he will return. When he does,\r\ndear John, let me tell him that I have at last spoken to you, and let\r\nme bring you together. He will certainly help us to a new livelihood.\r\nHis entreaty was that he might do something to smooth my life and\r\nyours; and I gave him my promise that if we ever wanted a friend, I\r\nwould remember him. Then his name was to be no secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother, who had listened with close attention,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdescribe this gentleman to me. I surely ought to know one who knows me\r\nso well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister painted, as vividly as she could, the features, stature, and\r\ndress of her visitor; but John Carker, either from having no knowledge\r\nof the original, or from some fault in her description, or from some\r\nabstraction of his thoughts as he walked to and fro, pondering, could\r\nnot recognise the portrait she presented to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was agreed between them that he should see the original\r\nwhen he next appeared. This concluded, the sister applied herself, with\r\na less anxious breast, to her domestic occupations; and the grey-haired\r\nman, late Junior of Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s, devoted the first day of his unwonted\r\nliberty to working in the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late at night, and the brother was reading aloud while the\r\nsister plied her needle, when they were interrupted by a knocking at\r\nthe door. In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered\r\nabout them in connexion with their fugitive brother, this sound,\r\nunusual there, became almost alarming. The brother going to the door,\r\nthe sister sat and listened timidly. Someone spoke to him, and he\r\nreplied and seemed surprised; and after a few words, the two approached\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother, lighting in their late visitor, and\r\nspeaking in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Morfin\xe2\x80\x94the gentleman so long in Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHouse with James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister started back, as if a ghost had entered. In the doorway\r\nstood the unknown friend, with the dark hair sprinkled with grey, the\r\nruddy face, the broad clear brow, and hazel eyes, whose secret she had\r\nkept so long!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half-breathless. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the gentleman I told you of,\r\ntoday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman, Miss Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, coming in\xe2\x80\x94for he had\r\nstopped a moment in the doorway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis greatly relieved to hear you say\r\nthat: he has been devising ways and means, all the way here, of\r\nexplaining himself, and has been satisfied with none. Mr John, I am not\r\nquite a stranger here. You were stricken with astonishment when you saw\r\nme at your door just now. I observe you are more astonished at present.\r\nWell! That\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable enough under existing circumstances. If we were\r\nnot such creatures of habit as we are, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have reason to be\r\nastonished half so often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, he had greeted Harriet with that able mingling of\r\ncordiality and respect which she recollected so well, and had sat down\r\nnear her, pulled off his gloves, and thrown them into his hat upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing astonishing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin my having conceived a\r\ndesire to see your sister, Mr John, or in my having gratified it in my\r\nown way. As to the regularity of my visits since (which she may have\r\nmentioned to you), there is nothing extraordinary in that. They soon\r\ngrew into a habit; and we are creatures of habit\xe2\x80\x94creatures of habit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPutting his hands into his pockets, and leaning back in his chair, he\r\nlooked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to\r\nsee them together; and went on to say, with a kind of irritable\r\nthoughtfulness: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this same habit that confirms some of us, who are\r\ncapable of better things, in Lucifer\xe2\x80\x99s own pride and stubbornness\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nconfirms and deepens others of us in villainy\xe2\x80\x94more of us in\r\nindifference \xe2\x80\x94that hardens us from day to day, according to the temper\r\nof our clay, like images, and leaves us as susceptible as images to new\r\nimpressions and convictions. You shall judge of its influence on me,\r\nJohn. For more years than I need name, I had my small, and exactly\r\ndefined share, in the management of Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House, and saw your\r\nbrother (who has proved himself a scoundrel! Your sister will forgive\r\nmy being obliged to mention it) extending and extending his influence,\r\nuntil the business and its owner were his football; and saw you toiling\r\nat your obscure desk every day; and was quite content to be as little\r\ntroubled as I might be, out of my own strip of duty, and to let\r\neverything about me go on, day by day, unquestioned, like a great\r\nmachine\xe2\x80\x94that was its habit and mine\xe2\x80\x94and to take it all for granted, and\r\nconsider it all right. My Wednesday nights came regularly round, our\r\nquartette parties came regularly off, my violoncello was in good tune,\r\nand there was nothing wrong in my world\xe2\x80\x94or if anything not much\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nlittle or much, it was no affair of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can answer for your being more respected and beloved during all that\r\ntime than anybody in the House, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! Good-natured and easy enough, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nhabit I had. It suited the Manager; it suited the man he managed: it\r\nsuited me best of all. I did what was allotted to me to do, made no\r\ncourt to either of them, and was glad to occupy a station in which none\r\nwas required. So I should have gone on till now, but that my room had a\r\nthin wall. You can tell your sister that it was divided from the\r\nManager\xe2\x80\x99s room by a wainscot partition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were adjoining rooms; had been one, Perhaps, originally; and were\r\nseparated, as Mr Morfin says,\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother, looking back to him\r\nfor the resumption of his explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have whistled, hummed tunes, gone accurately through the whole of\r\nBeethoven\xe2\x80\x99s Sonata in B, to let him know that I was within hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Morfin; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he never heeded me. It happened seldom enough that\r\nI was within hearing of anything of a private nature, certainly. But\r\nwhen I was, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise avoid knowing something of it, I\r\nwalked out. I walked out once, John, during a conversation between two\r\nbrothers, to which, in the beginning, young Walter Gay was a party. But\r\nI overheard some of it before I left the room. You remember it\r\nsufficiently, perhaps, to tell your sister what its nature was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt referred, Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cto the past,\r\nand to our relative positions in the House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts matter was not new to me, but was presented in a new aspect. It\r\nshook me in my habit\xe2\x80\x94the habit of nine-tenths of the world\xe2\x80\x94of believing\r\nthat all was right about me, because I was used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said their\r\nvisitor; \xe2\x80\x9cand induced me to recall the history of the two brothers, and\r\nto ponder on it. I think it was almost the first time in my life when I\r\nfell into this train of reflection\xe2\x80\x94how will many things that are\r\nfamiliar, and quite matters of course to us now, look, when we come to\r\nsee them from that new and distant point of view which we must all take\r\nup, one day or other? I was something less good-natured, as the phrase\r\ngoes, after that morning, less easy and complacent altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat for a minute or so, drumming with one hand on the table; and\r\nresumed in a hurry, as if he were anxious to get rid of his confession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I knew what to do, or whether I could do anything, there was a\r\nsecond conversation between the same two brothers, in which their\r\nsister was mentioned. I had no scruples of conscience in suffering all\r\nthe waifs and strays of that conversation to float to me as freely as\r\nthey would. I considered them mine by right. After that, I came here to\r\nsee the sister for myself. The first time I stopped at the garden gate,\r\nI made a pretext of inquiring into the character of a poor neighbour;\r\nbut I wandered out of that tract, and I think Miss Harriet mistrusted\r\nme. The second time I asked leave to come in; came in; and said what I\r\nwished to say. Your sister showed me reasons which I dared not dispute,\r\nfor receiving no assistance from me then; but I established a means of\r\ncommunication between us, which remained unbroken until within these\r\nfew days, when I was prevented, by important matters that have lately\r\ndevolved upon me, from maintaining them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow little I have suspected this,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I have seen\r\nyou every day, Sir! If Harriet could have guessed your name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to tell you the truth, John,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cI kept it\r\nto myself for two reasons. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the first might have been\r\nbinding alone; but one has no business to take credit for good\r\nintentions, and I made up my mind, at all events, not to disclose\r\nmyself until I should be able to do you some real service or other. My\r\nsecond reason was, that I always hoped there might be some lingering\r\npossibility of your brother\xe2\x80\x99s relenting towards you both; and in that\r\ncase, I felt that where there was the chance of a man of his\r\nsuspicious, watchful character, discovering that you had been secretly\r\nbefriended by me, there was the chance of a new and fatal cause of\r\ndivision. I resolved, to be sure, at the risk of turning his\r\ndispleasure against myself\xe2\x80\x94which would have been no matter\xe2\x80\x94to watch my\r\nopportunity of serving you with the head of the House; but the\r\ndistractions of death, courtship, marriage, and domestic unhappiness,\r\nhave left us no head but your brother for this long, long time. And it\r\nwould have been better for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, dropping his voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto have been a lifeless trunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed conscious that these latter words had escaped him against his\r\nwill, and stretching out a hand to the brother, and a hand to the\r\nsister, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I could desire to say, and more, I have now said. All I mean goes\r\nbeyond words, as I hope you understand and believe. The time has come,\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x94though most unfortunately and unhappily come\xe2\x80\x94when I may help you\r\nwithout interfering with that redeeming struggle, which has lasted\r\nthrough so many years; since you were discharged from it today by no\r\nact of your own. It is late; I need say no more tonight. You will\r\nguard the treasure you have here, without advice or reminder from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words he rose to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut go you first, John,\xe2\x80\x9d he said goodhumouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a light,\r\nwithout saying what you want to say, whatever that may be;\xe2\x80\x9d John\r\nCarker\xe2\x80\x99s heart was full, and he would have relieved it in speech, if he\r\ncould; \xe2\x80\x9cand let me have a word with your sister. We have talked alone\r\nbefore, and in this room too; though it looks more natural with you\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing him out with his eyes, he turned kindly to Harriet, and said\r\nin a lower voice, and with an altered and graver manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to ask me something of the man whose sister it is your\r\nmisfortune to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dread to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have looked so earnestly at me more than once,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the\r\nvisitor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I think I can divine your question. Has he taken money?\r\nIs it that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he has abused his trust in many ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Morfin; \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\r\nhas oftener dealt and speculated to advantage for himself, than for the\r\nHouse he represented; that he has led the House on, to prodigious\r\nventures, often resulting in enormous losses; that he has always\r\npampered the vanity and ambition of his employer, when it was his duty\r\nto have held them in check, and shown, as it was in his power to do, to\r\nwhat they tended here or there; will not, perhaps, surprise you now.\r\nUndertakings have been entered on, to swell the reputation of the House\r\nfor vast resources, and to exhibit it in magnificent contrast to other\r\nmerchants\xe2\x80\x99 Houses, of which it requires a steady head to contemplate\r\nthe possibly\xe2\x80\x94a few disastrous changes of affairs might render them the\r\nprobably\xe2\x80\x94ruinous consequences. In the midst of the many transactions of\r\nthe House, in most parts of the world: a great labyrinth of which only\r\nhe has held the clue: he has had the opportunity, and he seems to have\r\nused it, of keeping the various results afloat, when ascertained, and\r\nsubstituting estimates and generalities for facts. But latterly\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nfollow me, Miss Harriet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with her frightened face fixed on\r\nhis. \xe2\x80\x9cPray tell me all the worst at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLatterly, he appears to have devoted the greatest pains to making\r\nthese results so plain and clear, that reference to the private books\r\nenables one to grasp them, numerous and varying as they are, with\r\nextraordinary ease. As if he had resolved to show his employer at one\r\nbroad view what has been brought upon him by ministration to his ruling\r\npassion! That it has been his constant practice to minister to that\r\npassion basely, and to flatter it corruptly, is indubitable. In that,\r\nhis criminality, as it is connected with the affairs of the House,\r\nchiefly consists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne other word before you leave me, dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno danger in all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow danger?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, with a little hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the credit of the House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help answering you plainly, and trusting you completely,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Morfin, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s survey of her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may. Indeed you may!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I may. Danger to the House\xe2\x80\x99s credit? No; none There may be\r\ndifficulty, greater or less difficulty, but no danger, unless\xe2\x80\x94unless,\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94the head of the House, unable to bring his mind to the reduction\r\nof its enterprises, and positively refusing to believe that it is, or\r\ncan be, in any position but the position in which he has always\r\nrepresented it to himself, should urge it beyond its strength. Then it\r\nwould totter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no apprehension of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be no half-confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, shaking her hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbetween us. Mr Dombey is unapproachable by anyone, and his state of\r\nmind is haughty, rash, unreasonable, and ungovernable, now. But he is\r\ndisturbed and agitated now beyond all common bounds, and it may pass.\r\nYou now know all, both worst and best. No more tonight, and\r\ngood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he kissed her hand, and, passing out to the door where her\r\nbrother stood awaiting his coming, put him cheerfully aside when he\r\nessayed to speak; told him that, as they would see each other soon and\r\noften, he might speak at another time, if he would, but there was no\r\nleisure for it then; and went away at a round pace, in order that no\r\nword of gratitude might follow him.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister sat conversing by the fireside, until it was\r\nalmost day; made sleepless by this glimpse of the new world that opened\r\nbefore them, and feeling like two people shipwrecked long ago, upon a\r\nsolitary coast, to whom a ship had come at last, when they were old in\r\nresignation, and had lost all thought of any other home. But another\r\nand different kind of disquietude kept them waking too. The darkness\r\nout of which this light had broken on them gathered around; and the\r\nshadow of their guilty brother was in the house where his foot had\r\nnever trod.\r\n\r\nNor was it to be driven out, nor did it fade before the sun. Next\r\nmorning it was there; at noon; at night Darkest and most distinct at\r\nnight, as is now to be told.\r\n\r\nJohn Carker had gone out, in pursuance of a letter of appointment from\r\ntheir friend, and Harriet was left in the house alone. She had been\r\nalone some hours. A dull, grave evening, and a deepening twilight, were\r\nnot favourable to the removal of the oppression on her spirits. The\r\nidea of this brother, long unseen and unknown, flitted about her in\r\nfrightful shapes. He was dead, dying, calling to her, staring at her,\r\nfrowning on her. The pictures in her mind were so obtrusive and exact\r\nthat, as the twilight deepened, she dreaded to raise her head and look\r\nat the dark corners of the room, lest his wraith, the offspring of her\r\nexcited imagination, should be waiting there, to startle her. Once she\r\nhad such a fancy of his being in the next room, hiding\xe2\x80\x94though she knew\r\nquite well what a distempered fancy it was, and had no belief in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that she forced herself to go there, for her own conviction. But in\r\nvain. The room resumed its shadowy terrors, the moment she left it; and\r\nshe had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of\r\ndread, than if they had been stone giants, rooted in the solid earth.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark, and she was sitting near the window, with her head\r\nupon her hand, looking down, when, sensible of a sudden increase in the\r\ngloom of the apartment, she raised her eyes, and uttered an involuntary\r\ncry. Close to the glass, a pale scared face gazed in; vacantly, for an\r\ninstant, as searching for an object; then the eyes rested on herself,\r\nand lighted up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me in! Let me in! I want to speak to you!\xe2\x80\x9d and the hand rattled on\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nShe recognised immediately the woman with the long dark hair, to whom\r\nshe had given warmth, food, and shelter, one wet night. Naturally\r\nafraid of her, remembering her violent behaviour, Harriet, retreating a\r\nlittle from the window, stood undecided and alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me in! Let me speak to you! I am thankful\xe2\x80\x94quiet\xe2\x80\x94humble\xe2\x80\x94anything\r\nyou like. But let me speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vehement manner of the entreaty, the earnest expression of the\r\nface, the trembling of the two hands that were raised imploringly, a\r\ncertain dread and terror in the voice akin to her own condition at the\r\nmoment, prevailed with Harriet. She hastened to the door and opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in, or shall I speak here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, catching at her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you want? What is it that you have to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much, but let me say it out, or I shall never say it. I am tempted\r\nnow to go away. There seem to be hands dragging me from the door. Let\r\nme come in, if you can trust me for this once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer energy again prevailed, and they passed into the firelight of the\r\nlittle kitchen, where she had before sat, and ate, and dried her\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, kneeling down beside her, \xe2\x80\x9cand look at me. You\r\nremember me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember what I told you I had been, and where I came from, ragged\r\nand lame, with the fierce wind and weather beating on my head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how I came back that night, and threw your money in the dirt,\r\nand you and your race. Now, see me here, upon my knees. Am I less\r\nearnest now, than I was then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf what you ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cis forgiveness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, with a proud, fierce look \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\r\nask is to be believed. Now you shall judge if I am worthy of belief,\r\nboth as I was, and as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill upon her knees, and with her eyes upon the fire, and the fire\r\nshining on her ruined beauty and her wild black hair, one long tress of\r\nwhich she pulled over her shoulder, and wound about her hand, and\r\nthoughtfully bit and tore while speaking, she went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was young and pretty, and this,\xe2\x80\x9d plucking contemptuously at the\r\nhair she held, \xe2\x80\x9cwas only handled delicately, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be admired\r\nenough, my mother, who had not been very mindful of me as a child,\r\nfound out my merits, and was fond of me, and proud of me. She was\r\ncovetous and poor, and thought to make a sort of property of me. No\r\ngreat lady ever thought that of a daughter yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, or acted as\r\nif she did\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s never done, we all know\xe2\x80\x94and that shows that the only\r\ninstances of mothers bringing up their daughters wrong, and evil coming\r\nof it, are among such miserable folks as us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking at the fire, as if she were forgetful, for the moment, of\r\nhaving any auditor, she continued in a dreamy way, as she wound the\r\nlong tress of hair tight round and round her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat came of that, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t say. Wretched marriages don\xe2\x80\x99t come of\r\nsuch things, in our degree; only wretchedness and ruin. Wretchedness\r\nand ruin came on me\xe2\x80\x94came on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaising her eyes swiftly from their moody gaze upon the fire, to\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s face, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am wasting time, and there is none to spare; yet if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought\r\nof all, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here now. Wretchedness and ruin came on me, I\r\nsay. I was made a short-lived toy, and flung aside more cruelly and\r\ncarelessly than even such things are. By whose hand do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you tremble?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Alice, with an eager look. \xe2\x80\x9cHis usage\r\nmade a Devil of me. I sunk in wretchedness and ruin, lower and lower\r\nyet. I was concerned in a robbery\xe2\x80\x94in every part of it but the gains\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwas found out, and sent to be tried, without a friend, without a penny.\r\nThough I was but a girl, I would have gone to Death, sooner than ask\r\nhim for a word, if a word of his could have saved me. I would! To any\r\ndeath that could have been invented. But my mother, covetous always,\r\nsent to him in my name, told the true story of my case, and humbly\r\nprayed and petitioned for a small last gift\xe2\x80\x94for not so many pounds as I\r\nhave fingers on this hand. Who was it, do you think, who snapped his\r\nfingers at me in my misery, lying, as he believed, at his feet, and\r\nleft me without even this poor sign of remembrance; well satisfied that\r\nI should be sent abroad, beyond the reach of farther trouble to him,\r\nand should die, and rot there? Who was this, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you tremble?\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, laying her hand upon her arm, and\r\nlooking in her face, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that the answer is on your lips! It was your\r\nbrother James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet trembled more and more, but did not avert her eyes from the\r\neager look that rested on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I knew you were his sister\xe2\x80\x94which was on that night\xe2\x80\x94I came back,\r\nweary and lame, to spurn your gift. I felt that night as if I could\r\nhave travelled, weary and lame, over the whole world, to stab him, if I\r\ncould have found him in a lonely place with no one near. Do you believe\r\nthat I was earnest in all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! Good Heaven, why are you come again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, with the same grasp of her arm, and the same\r\nlook in her face, \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen him! I have followed him with my eyes.\r\nIn the broad day. If any spark of my resentment slumbered in my bosom,\r\nit sprung into a blaze when my eyes rested on him. You know he has\r\nwronged a proud man, and made him his deadly enemy. What if I had given\r\ninformation of him to that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInformation!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I had found out one who knew your brother\xe2\x80\x99s secret; who knew\r\nthe manner of his flight, who knew where he and the companion of his\r\nflight were gone? What if I had made him utter all his knowledge, word\r\nby word, before his enemy, concealed to hear it? What if I had sat by\r\nat the time, looking into this enemy\xe2\x80\x99s face, and seeing it change till\r\nit was scarcely human? What if I had seen him rush away, mad, in\r\npursuit? What if I knew, now, that he was on his road, more fiend than\r\nman, and must, in so many hours, come up with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemove your hand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, recoiling. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away! Your touch is\r\ndreadful to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done this,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other, with her eager look, regardless\r\nof the interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I speak and look as if I really had? Do you\r\nbelieve what I am saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I must. Let my arm go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. A moment more. You can think what my revengeful purpose must\r\nhave been, to last so long, and urge me to do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen when you see me now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice hoarsely, \xe2\x80\x9chere again, kneeling\r\nquietly on the ground, with my touch upon your arm, with my eyes upon\r\nyour face, you may believe that there is no common earnestness in what\r\nI say, and that no common struggle has been battling in my breast. I am\r\nashamed to speak the words, but I relent. I despise myself; I have\r\nfought with myself all day, and all last night; but I relent towards\r\nhim without reason, and wish to repair what I have done, if it is\r\npossible. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them come together while his pursuer is so\r\nblind and headlong. If you had seen him as he went out last night, you\r\nwould know the danger better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it be prevented? What can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll night long,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other, hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI had dreams of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and yet I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\xe2\x80\x94in his blood. All day, I have had him near\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, shuddering at these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anyone who\xe2\x80\x99ll write, or send, or go to him, let them lose\r\nno time. He is at Dijon. Do you know the name, and where it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarn him that the man he has made his enemy is in a frenzy, and that\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know him if he makes light of his approach. Tell him that he\r\nis on the road\xe2\x80\x94I know he is!\xe2\x80\x94and hurrying on. Urge him to get away\r\nwhile there is time\xe2\x80\x94if there is time\xe2\x80\x94and not to meet him yet. A month\r\nor so will make years of difference. Let them not encounter, through\r\nme. Anywhere but there! Any time but now! Let his foe follow him, and\r\nfind him for himself, but not through me! There is enough upon my head\r\nwithout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire ceased to be reflected in her jet black hair, uplifted face,\r\nand eager eyes; her hand was gone from Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s arm; and the place\r\nwhere she had been was empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\nThe Fugitives\r\n\r\n\r\nTea-time, an hour short of midnight; the place, a French apartment,\r\ncomprising some half-dozen rooms;\xe2\x80\x94a dull cold hall or corridor, a\r\ndining-room, a drawing-room, a bed-room, and an inner drawingroom, or\r\nboudoir, smaller and more retired than the rest. All these shut in by\r\none large pair of doors on the main staircase, but each room provided\r\nwith two or three pairs of doors of its own, establishing several means\r\nof communication with the remaining portion of the apartment, or with\r\ncertain small passages within the wall, leading, as is not unusual in\r\nsuch houses, to some back stairs with an obscure outlet below. The\r\nwhole situated on the first floor of so large an Hotel, that it did not\r\nabsorb one entire row of windows upon one side of the square court-yard\r\nin the centre, upon which the whole four sides of the mansion looked.\r\n\r\nAn air of splendour, sufficiently faded to be melancholy, and\r\nsufficiently dazzling to clog and embarrass the details of life with a\r\nshow of state, reigned in these rooms. The walls and ceilings were\r\ngilded and painted; the floors were waxed and polished; crimson drapery\r\nhung in festoons from window, door, and mirror; and candelabra, gnarled\r\nand intertwisted like the branches of trees, or horns of animals, stuck\r\nout from the panels of the wall. But in the day-time, when the\r\nlattice-blinds (now closely shut) were opened, and the light let in,\r\ntraces were discernible among this finery, of wear and tear and dust,\r\nof sun and damp and smoke, and lengthened intervals of want of use and\r\nhabitation, when such shows and toys of life seem sensitive like life,\r\nand waste as men shut up in prison do. Even night, and clusters of\r\nburning candles, could not wholly efface them, though the general\r\nglitter threw them in the shade.\r\n\r\nThe glitter of bright tapers, and their reflection in looking-glasses,\r\nscraps of gilding and gay colours, were confined, on this night, to one\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94that smaller room within the rest, just now enumerated. Seen from\r\nthe hall, where a lamp was feebly burning, through the dark perspective\r\nof open doors, it looked as shining and precious as a gem. In the heart\r\nof its radiance sat a beautiful woman\xe2\x80\x94Edith.\r\n\r\nShe was alone. The same defiant, scornful woman still. The cheek a\r\nlittle worn, the eye a little larger in appearance, and more lustrous,\r\nbut the haughty bearing just the same. No shame upon her brow; no late\r\nrepentance bending her disdainful neck. Imperious and stately yet, and\r\nyet regardless of herself and of all else, she sat with her dark eyes\r\ncast down, waiting for someone.\r\n\r\nNo book, no work, no occupation of any kind but her own thought,\r\nbeguiled the tardy time. Some purpose, strong enough to fill up any\r\npause, possessed her. With her lips pressed together, and quivering if\r\nfor a moment she released them from her control; with her nostril\r\ninflated; her hands clasped in one another; and her purpose swelling in\r\nher breast; she sat, and waited.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of a key in the outer door, and a footstep in the hall,\r\nshe started up, and cried \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer was in French, and\r\ntwo men came in with jingling trays, to make preparation for supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho had bade them to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur had commanded it, when it was his pleasure to take the\r\napartment. Monsieur had said, when he stayed there for an hour, en\r\nroute, and left the letter for Madame\xe2\x80\x94Madame had received it surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pardons! The sudden apprehension that it might have been\r\nforgotten had struck him;\xe2\x80\x9d a bald man, with a large beard from a\r\nneighbouring restaurant; \xe2\x80\x9cwith despair! Monsieur had said that supper\r\nwas to be ready at that hour: also that he had forewarned Madame of the\r\ncommands he had given, in his letter. Monsieur had done the Golden Head\r\nthe honour to request that the supper should be choice and delicate.\r\nMonsieur would find that his confidence in the Golden Head was not\r\nmisplaced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith said no more, but looked on thoughtfully while they prepared the\r\ntable for two persons, and set the wine upon it. She arose before they\r\nhad finished, and taking a lamp, passed into the bed-chamber and into\r\nthe drawing-room, where she hurriedly but narrowly examined all the\r\ndoors; particularly one in the former room that opened on the passage\r\nin the wall. From this she took the key, and put it on the outer side.\r\nShe then came back.\r\n\r\nThe men\xe2\x80\x94the second of whom was a dark, bilious subject, in a jacket,\r\nclose shaved, and with a black head of hair close cropped\xe2\x80\x94had completed\r\ntheir preparation of the table, and were standing looking at it. He who\r\nhad spoken before, inquired whether Madame thought it would be long\r\nbefore Monsieur arrived?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. It was all one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon! There was the supper! It should be eaten on the instant.\r\nMonsieur (who spoke French like an Angel\xe2\x80\x94or a Frenchman\xe2\x80\x94it was all the\r\nsame) had spoken with great emphasis of his punctuality. But the\r\nEnglish nation had so grand a genius for punctuality. Ah! what noise!\r\nGreat Heaven, here was Monsieur. Behold him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn effect, Monsieur, admitted by the other of the two, came, with his\r\ngleaming teeth, through the dark rooms, like a mouth; and arriving in\r\nthat sanctuary of light and colour, a figure at full length, embraced\r\nMadame, and addressed her in the French tongue as his charming wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! Madame is going to faint. Madame is overcome with joy!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nbald man with the beard observed it, and cried out.\r\n\r\nMadame had only shrunk and shivered. Before the words were spoken, she\r\nwas standing with her hand upon the velvet back of a great chair; her\r\nfigure drawn up to its full height, and her face immoveable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrancois has flown over to the Golden Head for supper. He flies on\r\nthese occasions like an angel or a bird. The baggage of Monsieur is in\r\nhis room. All is arranged. The supper will be here this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d These\r\nfacts the bald man notified with bows and smiles, and presently the\r\nsupper came.\r\n\r\nThe hot dishes were on a chafing-dish; the cold already set forth, with\r\nthe change of service on a sideboard. Monsieur was satisfied with this\r\narrangement. The supper table being small, it pleased him very well.\r\nLet them set the chafing-dish upon the floor, and go. He would remove\r\nthe dishes with his own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon!\xe2\x80\x9d said the bald man, politely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur was of another opinion. He required no further attendance that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Madame\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the bald man hinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monsieur, \xe2\x80\x9chad her own maid. It was enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA million pardons! No! Madame had no maid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith \xe2\x80\x9cIt was my choice to do so. I am well\r\nused to travelling; I want no attendance. They need send nobody to me.\r\n\r\nMonsieur accordingly, persevering in his first proposed impossibility,\r\nproceeded to follow the two attendants to the outer door, and secure it\r\nafter them for the night. The bald man turning round to bow, as he went\r\nout, observed that Madame still stood with her hand upon the velvet\r\nback of the great chair, and that her face was quite regardless of him,\r\nthough she was looking straight before her.\r\n\r\nAs the sound of Carker\xe2\x80\x99s fastening the door resounded through the\r\nintermediate rooms, and seemed to come hushed and stilled into that\r\nlast distant one, the sound of the Cathedral clock striking twelve\r\nmingled with it, in Edith\xe2\x80\x99s ears. She heard him pause, as if he heard\r\nit too and listened; and then came back towards her, laying a long\r\ntrain of footsteps through the silence, and shutting all the doors\r\nbehind him as he came along. Her hand, for a moment, left the velvet\r\nchair to bring a knife within her reach upon the table; then she stood\r\nas she had stood before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange to come here by yourself, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned.\r\n\r\nHer tone was so harsh; the quick turn of her head so fierce; her\r\nattitude so repellent; and her frown so black; that he stood, with the\r\nlamp in his hand, looking at her, as if she had struck him motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he at length repeated, putting down the lamp, and smiling his\r\nmost courtly smile, \xe2\x80\x9chow strange to come here alone! It was unnecessary\r\ncaution surely, and might have defeated itself. You were to have\r\nengaged an attendant at Havre or Rouen, and have had abundance of time\r\nfor the purpose, though you had been the most capricious and difficult\r\n(as you are the most beautiful, my love) of women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes gleamed strangely on him, but she stood with her hand resting\r\non the chair, and said not a word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Carker, \xe2\x80\x9cseen you look so handsome, as you do\r\ntonight. Even the picture I have carried in my mind during this cruel\r\nprobation, and which I have contemplated night and day, is exceeded by\r\nthe reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a word. Not a look Her eyes completely hidden by their drooping\r\nlashes, but her head held up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard, unrelenting terms they were!\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthey are all fulfilled and passed, and make the present more delicious\r\nand more safe. Sicily shall be the place of our retreat. In the idlest\r\nand easiest part of the world, my soul, we\xe2\x80\x99ll both seek compensation\r\nfor old slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was coming gaily towards her, when, in an instant, she caught the\r\nknife up from the table, and started one pace back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand still!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall murder you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden change in her, the towering fury and intense abhorrence\r\nsparkling in her eyes and lighting up her brow, made him stop as if a\r\nfire had stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand still!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ccome no nearer me, upon your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both stood looking at each other. Rage and astonishment were in\r\nhis face, but he controlled them, and said lightly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! Tush, we are alone, and out of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s sight and\r\nhearing. Do you think to frighten me with these tricks of virtue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think to frighten me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom any purpose\r\nthat I have, and any course I am resolved upon, by reminding me of the\r\nsolitude of this place, and there being no help near? Me, who am here\r\nalone, designedly? If I feared you, should I not have avoided you? If I\r\nfeared you, should I be here, in the dead of night, telling you to your\r\nface what I am going to tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou handsome shrew? Handsomer so, than\r\nany other woman in her best humour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, until you go back to that\r\nchair\xe2\x80\x94except this, once again\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t come near me! Not a step nearer. I\r\ntell you, if you do, as Heaven sees us, I shall murder you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mistake me for your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, with a grin.\r\n\r\nDisdaining to reply, she stretched her arm out, pointing to the chair.\r\nHe bit his lip, frowned, laughed, and sat down in it, with a baffled,\r\nirresolute, impatient air, he was unable to conceal; and biting his\r\nnail nervously, and looking at her sideways, with bitter discomfiture,\r\neven while he feigned to be amused by her caprice.\r\n\r\nShe put the knife down upon the table, and touching her bosom with her\r\nhand, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something lying here that is no love trinket, and sooner than\r\nendure your touch once more, I would use it on you\xe2\x80\x94and you know it,\r\nwhile I speak\xe2\x80\x94with less reluctance than I would on any other creeping\r\nthing that lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe affected to laugh jestingly, and entreated her to act her play out\r\nquickly, for the supper was growing cold. But the secret look with\r\nwhich he regarded her, was more sullen and lowering, and he struck his\r\nfoot once upon the floor with a muttered oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, bending her darkest glance upon him, \xe2\x80\x9chas\r\nyour bold knavery assailed me with outrage and insult? How many times\r\nin your smooth manner, and mocking words and looks, have I been twitted\r\nwith my courtship and my marriage? How many times have you laid bare my\r\nwound of love for that sweet, injured girl and lacerated it? How often\r\nhave you fanned the fire on which, for two years, I have writhed; and\r\ntempted me to take a desperate revenge, when it has most tortured me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have kept a good\r\naccount, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty accurate. Come, Edith. To your husband,\r\npoor wretch, this was well enough\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust,\r\nthat he shrunk under, let him brave it as he would, \xe2\x80\x9cif all my other\r\nreasons for despising him could have been blown away like feathers, his\r\nhaving you for his counsellor and favourite, would have almost been\r\nenough to hold their place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a reason why you have run away with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her,\r\ntauntingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and why we are face to face for the last time. Wretch! We meet\r\ntonight, and part tonight. For not one moment after I have ceased to\r\nspeak, will I stay here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her with his ugliest look, and gripped the table with\r\nhis hand; but neither rose, nor otherwise answered or threatened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, confronting him steadfastly, \xe2\x80\x9cwho from her\r\nchildhood has been shamed and steeled. I have been offered and\r\nrejected, put up and appraised, until my very soul has sickened. I have\r\nnot had an accomplishment or grace that might have been a resource to\r\nme, but it has been paraded and vended to enhance my value, as if the\r\ncommon crier had called it through the streets. My poor, proud friends,\r\nhave looked on and approved; and every tie between us has been deadened\r\nin my breast. There is not one of them for whom I care, as I could care\r\nfor a pet dog. I stand alone in the world, remembering well what a\r\nhollow world it has been to me, and what a hollow part of it I have\r\nbeen myself. You know this, and you know that my fame with it is\r\nworthless to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I imagined that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd calculated on it,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cand so pursued me. Grown too\r\nindifferent for any opposition but indifference, to the daily working\r\nof the hands that had moulded me to this; and knowing that my marriage\r\nwould at least prevent their hawking of me up and down; I suffered\r\nmyself to be sold, as infamously as any woman with a halter round her\r\nneck is sold in any market-place. You know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, showing all his teeth \xe2\x80\x9cI know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd calculated on it,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined once more, \xe2\x80\x9cand so pursued me.\r\nFrom my marriage day, I found myself exposed to such new shame\xe2\x80\x94to such\r\nsolicitation and pursuit (expressed as clearly as if it had been\r\nwritten in the coarsest words, and thrust into my hand at every turn)\r\nfrom one mean villain, that I felt as if I had never known humiliation\r\ntill that time. This shame my husband fixed upon me; hemmed me round\r\nwith, himself; steeped me in, with his own hands, and of his own act,\r\nrepeated hundreds of times. And thus\xe2\x80\x94forced by the two from every point\r\nof rest I had\xe2\x80\x94forced by the two to yield up the last retreat of love\r\nand gentleness within me, or to be a new misfortune on its innocent\r\nobject\xe2\x80\x94driven from each to each, and beset by one when I escaped the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94my anger rose almost to distraction against both. I do not know\r\nagainst which it rose higher\xe2\x80\x94the master or the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched her closely, as she stood before him in the very triumph of\r\nher indignant beauty. She was resolute, he saw; undauntable; with no\r\nmore fear of him than of a worm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I say of honour or of chastity to you!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nmeaning would it have to you; what meaning would it have from me! But\r\nif I tell you that the lightest touch of your hand makes my blood cold\r\nwith antipathy; that from the hour when I first saw and hated you, to\r\nnow, when my instinctive repugnance is enhanced by every minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge of you I have since had, you have been a loathsome creature\r\nto me which has not its like on earth; how then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered with a faint laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cAy! How then, my queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that night, when, emboldened by the scene you had assisted at, you\r\ndared come to my room and speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat passed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and laughed\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat passed?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour memory is so distinct,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have no doubt you can\r\nrecall it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHear it! Proposing then, this flight\xe2\x80\x94not this\r\nflight, but the flight you thought it\xe2\x80\x94you told me that in the having\r\ngiven you that meeting, and leaving you to be discovered there, if you\r\nso thought fit; and in the having suffered you to be alone with me many\r\ntimes before,\xe2\x80\x94and having made the opportunities, you said,\xe2\x80\x94and in the\r\nhaving openly avowed to you that I had no feeling for my husband but\r\naversion, and no care for myself\xe2\x80\x94I was lost; I had given you the power\r\nto traduce my name; and I lived, in virtuous reputation, at the\r\npleasure of your breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll stratagems in love\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old adage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cand then, the struggle that I long had\r\nhad with something that was not respect for my good fame\xe2\x80\x94that was I\r\nknow not what\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the clinging to that last retreat\xe2\x80\x94was ended. On\r\nthat night, and then, I turned from everything but passion and\r\nresentment. I struck a blow that laid your lofty master in the dust,\r\nand set you there, before me, looking at me now, and knowing what I\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sprung up from his chair with a great oath. She put her hand into\r\nher bosom, and not a finger trembled, not a hair upon her head was\r\nstirred. He stood still: she too: the table and chair between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I forget that this man put his lips to mine that night, and held\r\nme in his arms as he has done again tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, pointing at\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I forget the taint of his kiss upon my cheek\xe2\x80\x94the cheek that\r\nFlorence would have laid her guiltless face against\xe2\x80\x94when I forget my\r\nmeeting with her, while that taint was hot upon me, and in what a flood\r\nthe knowledge rushed upon me when I saw her, that in releasing her from\r\nthe persecution I had caused by my love, I brought a shame and\r\ndegradation on her name through mine, and in all time to come should be\r\nthe solitary figure representing in her mind her first avoidance of a\r\nguilty creature\xe2\x80\x94then, Husband, from whom I stand divorced henceforth, I\r\nwill forget these last two years, and undo what I have done, and\r\nundeceive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer flashing eyes, uplifted for a moment, lighted again on Carker, and\r\nshe held some letters out in her left hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee these!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have addressed these to me\r\nin the false name you go by; one here, some elsewhere on my road. The\r\nseals are unbroken. Take them back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe crunched them in her hand, and tossed them to his feet. And as she\r\nlooked upon him now, a smile was on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meet and part tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have fallen on Sicilian\r\ndays and sensual rest, too soon. You might have cajoled, and fawned,\r\nand played your traitor\xe2\x80\x99s part, a little longer, and grown richer. You\r\npurchase your voluptuous retirement dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, menacing her with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down! Have done\r\nwith this! What devil possesses you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir name is Legion,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, uprearing her proud form as if she\r\nwould have crushed him; \xe2\x80\x9cyou and your master have raised them in a\r\nfruitful house, and they shall tear you both. False to him, false to\r\nhis innocent child, false every way and everywhere, go forth and boast\r\nof me, and gnash your teeth, for once, to know that you are lying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood before her, muttering and menacing, and scowling round as if\r\nfor something that would help him to conquer her; but with the same\r\nindomitable spirit she opposed him, without faltering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn every vaunt you make,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my triumph. I single out\r\nin you the meanest man I know, the parasite and tool of the proud\r\ntyrant, that his wound may go the deeper, and may rankle more. Boast,\r\nand revenge me on him! You know how you came here tonight; you know\r\nhow you stand cowering there; you see yourself in colours quite as\r\ndespicable, if not as odious, as those in which I see you. Boast then,\r\nand revenge me on yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foam was on his lips; the wet stood on his forehead. If she would\r\nhave faltered once for only one half-moment, he would have pinioned\r\nher; but she was as firm as rock, and her searching eyes never left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t part so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am drivelling, to let you\r\ngo in your mad temper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am to be stayed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a ferocious gesture of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s mercy on you, if you try by coming near me!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif there are none of these same boasts and vaunts\r\non my part? What if I were to turn too? Come!\xe2\x80\x9d and his teeth fairly\r\nshone again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must make a treaty of this, or I may take some\r\nunexpected course. Sit down, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with eyes that seemed to sparkle fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nthrown my fame and good name to the winds! I have resolved to bear the\r\nshame that will attach to me\xe2\x80\x94resolved to know that it attaches\r\nfalsely\xe2\x80\x94that you know it too\xe2\x80\x94and that he does not, never can, and never\r\nshall. I\xe2\x80\x99ll die, and make no sign. For this, I am here alone with you,\r\nat the dead of night. For this, I have met you here, in a false name,\r\nas your wife. For this, I have been seen here by those men, and left\r\nhere. Nothing can save you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have sold his soul to root her, in her beauty, to the floor,\r\nand make her arms drop at her sides, and have her at his mercy. But he\r\ncould not look at her, and not be afraid of her. He saw a strength\r\nwithin her that was resistless. He saw that she was desperate, and that\r\nher unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing. His eyes followed\r\nthe hand that was put with such rugged uncongenial purpose into her\r\nwhite bosom, and he thought that if it struck at him, and failed, it\r\nwould strike there, just as soon.\r\n\r\nHe did not venture, therefore, to advance towards her; but the door by\r\nwhich he had entered was behind him, and he stepped back to lock it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLastly, take my warning! Look to yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and smiled\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been betrayed, as all betrayers are. It has been made\r\nknown that you are in this place, or were to be, or have been. If I\r\nlive, I saw my husband in a carriage in the street tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrumpet, it\xe2\x80\x99s false!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Carker.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the bell rang loudly in the hall. He turned white, as\r\nshe held her hand up like an enchantress, at whose invocation the sound\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! do you hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set his back against the door; for he saw a change in her, and\r\nfancied she was coming on to pass him. But, in a moment, she was gone\r\nthrough the opposite doors communicating with the bed-chamber, and they\r\nshut upon her.\r\n\r\nOnce turned, once changed in her inflexible unyielding look, he felt\r\nthat he could cope with her. He thought a sudden terror, occasioned by\r\nthis night-alarm, had subdued her; not the less readily, for her\r\noverwrought condition. Throwing open the doors, he followed, almost\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nBut the room was dark; and as she made no answer to his call, he was\r\nfain to go back for the lamp. He held it up, and looked round,\r\neverywhere, expecting to see her crouching in some corner; but the room\r\nwas empty. So, into the drawing-room and dining-room he went, in\r\nsuccession, with the uncertain steps of a man in a strange place;\r\nlooking fearfully about, and prying behind screens and couches; but she\r\nwas not there. No, nor in the hall, which was so bare that he could see\r\nthat, at a glance.\r\n\r\nAll this time, the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed, and\r\nthose without were beating at the door. He put his lamp down at a\r\ndistance, and going near it, listened. There were several voices\r\ntalking together: at least two of them in English; and though the door\r\nwas thick, and there was great confusion, he knew one of these too well\r\nto doubt whose voice it was.\r\n\r\nHe took up his lamp again, and came back quickly through all the rooms,\r\nstopping as he quitted each, and looking round for her, with the light\r\nraised above his head. He was standing thus in the bed-chamber, when\r\nthe door, leading to the little passage in the wall, caught his eye. He\r\nwent to it, and found it fastened on the other side; but she had\r\ndropped a veil in going through, and shut it in the door.\r\n\r\nAll this time the people on the stairs were ringing at the bell, and\r\nknocking with their hands and feet.\r\n\r\nHe was not a coward: but these sounds; what had gone before; the\r\nstrangeness of the place, which had confused him, even in his return\r\nfrom the hall; the frustration of his schemes (for, strange to say, he\r\nwould have been much bolder, if they had succeeded); the unseasonable\r\ntime; the recollection of having no one near to whom he could appeal\r\nfor any friendly office; above all, the sudden sense, which made even\r\nhis heart beat like lead, that the man whose confidence he had\r\noutraged, and whom he had so treacherously deceived, was there to\r\nrecognise and challenge him with his mask plucked off his face; struck\r\na panic through him. He tried the door in which the veil was shut, but\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t force it. He opened one of the windows, and looked down\r\nthrough the lattice of the blind, into the court-yard; but it was a\r\nhigh leap, and the stones were pitiless.\r\n\r\nThe ringing and knocking still continuing\xe2\x80\x94his panic too\xe2\x80\x94he went back to\r\nthe door in the bed-chamber, and with some new efforts, each more\r\nstubborn than the last, wrenched it open. Seeing the little staircase\r\nnot far off, and feeling the night-air coming up, he stole back for his\r\nhat and coat, made the door as secure after him as he could, crept down\r\nlamp in hand, extinguished it on seeing the street, and having put it\r\nin a corner, went out where the stars were shining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nRob the Grinder loses his Place\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Porter at the iron gate which shut the court-yard from the street,\r\nhad left the little wicket of his house open, and was gone away; no\r\ndoubt to mingle in the distant noise at the door of the great\r\nstaircase. Lifting the latch softly, Carker crept out, and shutting the\r\njangling gate after him with as little noise as possible, hurried off.\r\n\r\nIn the fever of his mortification and unavailing rage, the panic that\r\nhad seized upon him mastered him completely. It rose to such a height\r\nthat he would have blindly encountered almost any risk, rather than\r\nmeet the man of whom, two hours ago, he had been utterly regardless.\r\nHis fierce arrival, which he had never expected; the sound of his\r\nvoice; their having been so near a meeting, face to face; he would have\r\nbraved out this, after the first momentary shock of alarm, and would\r\nhave put as bold a front upon his guilt as any villain. But the\r\nspringing of his mine upon himself, seemed to have rent and shivered\r\nall his hardihood and self-reliance. Spurned like any reptile;\r\nentrapped and mocked; turned upon, and trodden down by the proud woman\r\nwhose mind he had slowly poisoned, as he thought, until she had sunk\r\ninto the mere creature of his pleasure; undeceived in his deceit, and\r\nwith his fox\xe2\x80\x99s hide stripped off, he sneaked away, abashed, degraded,\r\nand afraid.\r\n\r\nSome other terror came upon him quite removed from this of being\r\npursued, suddenly, like an electric shock, as he was creeping through\r\nthe streets Some visionary terror, unintelligible and inexplicable,\r\nassociated with a trembling of the ground,\xe2\x80\x94a rush and sweep of\r\nsomething through the air, like Death upon the wing. He shrunk, as if\r\nto let the thing go by. It was not gone, it never had been there, yet\r\nwhat a startling horror it had left behind.\r\n\r\nHe raised his wicked face so full of trouble, to the night sky, where\r\nthe stars, so full of peace, were shining on him as they had been when\r\nhe first stole out into the air; and stopped to think what he should\r\ndo. The dread of being hunted in a strange remote place, where the laws\r\nmight not protect him\xe2\x80\x94the novelty of the feeling that it was strange\r\nand remote, originating in his being left alone so suddenly amid the\r\nruins of his plans\xe2\x80\x94his greater dread of seeking refuge now, in Italy or\r\nin Sicily, where men might be hired to assassinate him, he thought, at\r\nany dark street corner\xe2\x80\x94the waywardness of guilt and fear\xe2\x80\x94perhaps some\r\nsympathy of action with the turning back of all his schemes\xe2\x80\x94impelled\r\nhim to turn back too, and go to England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am safer there, in any case. If I should not decide,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto give this fool a meeting, I am less likely to be traced there, than\r\nabroad here, now. And if I should (this cursed fit being over), at\r\nleast I shall not be alone, without a soul to speak to, or advise with,\r\nor stand by me. I shall not be run in upon and worried like a rat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe muttered Edith\xe2\x80\x99s name, and clenched his hand. As he crept along, in\r\nthe shadow of the massive buildings, he set his teeth, and muttered\r\ndreadful imprecations on her head, and looked from side to side, as if\r\nin search of her. Thus, he stole on to the gate of an inn-yard. The\r\npeople were a-bed; but his ringing at the bell soon produced a man with\r\na lantern, in company with whom he was presently in a dim coach-house,\r\nbargaining for the hire of an old phaeton, to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe bargain was a short one; and the horses were soon sent for. Leaving\r\nword that the carriage was to follow him when they came, he stole away\r\nagain, beyond the town, past the old ramparts, out on the open road,\r\nwhich seemed to glide away along the dark plain, like a stream.\r\n\r\nWhither did it flow? What was the end of it? As he paused, with some\r\nsuch suggestion within him, looking over the gloomy flat where the\r\nslender trees marked out the way, again that flight of Death came\r\nrushing up, again went on, impetuous and resistless, again was nothing\r\nbut a horror in his mind, dark as the scene and undefined as its\r\nremotest verge.\r\n\r\nThere was no wind; there was no passing shadow on the deep shade of the\r\nnight; there was no noise. The city lay behind him, lighted here and\r\nthere, and starry worlds were hidden by the masonry of spire and roof\r\nthat hardly made out any shapes against the sky. Dark and lonely\r\ndistance lay around him everywhere, and the clocks were faintly\r\nstriking two.\r\n\r\nHe went forward for what appeared a long time, and a long way; often\r\nstopping to listen. At last the ringing of horses\xe2\x80\x99 bells greeted his\r\nanxious ears. Now softer, and now louder, now inaudible, now ringing\r\nvery slowly over bad ground, now brisk and merry, it came on; until\r\nwith a loud shouting and lashing, a shadowy postillion muffled to the\r\neyes, checked his four struggling horses at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there! Monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur has walked a long way in the dark midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter. Everyone to his task. Were there any other horses ordered\r\nat the Post-house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand devils!\xe2\x80\x94and pardons! other horses? at this hour? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my friend. I am much hurried. Let us see how fast we can\r\ntravel! The faster, the more money there will be to drink. Off we go\r\nthen! Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa! whoop! Halloa! Hi!\xe2\x80\x9d Away, at a gallop, over the black\r\nlandscape, scattering the dust and dirt like spray!\r\n\r\nThe clatter and commotion echoed to the hurry and discordance of the\r\nfugitive\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. Nothing clear without, and nothing clear within.\r\nObjects flitting past, merging into one another, dimly descried,\r\nconfusedly lost sight of, gone! Beyond the changing scraps of fence and\r\ncottage immediately upon the road, a lowering waste. Beyond the\r\nshifting images that rose up in his mind and vanished as they showed\r\nthemselves, a black expanse of dread and rage and baffled villainy.\r\nOccasionally, a sigh of mountain air came from the distant Jura, fading\r\nalong the plain. Sometimes that rush which was so furious and horrible,\r\nagain came sweeping through his fancy, passed away, and left a chill\r\nupon his blood.\r\n\r\nThe lamps, gleaming on the medley of horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads, jumbled with the\r\nshadowy driver, and the fluttering of his cloak, made a thousand\r\nindistinct shapes, answering to his thoughts. Shadows of familiar\r\npeople, stooping at their desks and books, in their remembered\r\nattitudes; strange apparitions of the man whom he was flying from, or\r\nof Edith; repetitions in the ringing bells and rolling wheels, of words\r\nthat had been spoken; confusions of time and place, making last night a\r\nmonth ago, a month ago last night\xe2\x80\x94home now distant beyond hope, now\r\ninstantly accessible; commotion, discord, hurry, darkness, and\r\nconfusion in his mind, and all around him.\xe2\x80\x94Hallo! Hi! away at a gallop\r\nover the black landscape; dust and dirt flying like spray, the smoking\r\nhorses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon,\r\naway in a frantic triumph on the dark road\xe2\x80\x94whither?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain the nameless shock comes speeding up, and as it passes, the bells\r\nring in his ears \xe2\x80\x9cwhither?\xe2\x80\x9d The wheels roar in his ears \xe2\x80\x9cwhither?\xe2\x80\x9d All\r\nthe noise and rattle shapes itself into that cry. The lights and\r\nshadows dance upon the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads like imps. No stopping now: no\r\nslackening! On, on! Away with him upon the dark road wildly!\r\n\r\nHe could not think to any purpose. He could not separate one subject of\r\nreflection from another, sufficiently to dwell upon it, by itself, for\r\na minute at a time. The crash of his project for the gaining of a\r\nvoluptuous compensation for past restraint; the overthrow of his\r\ntreachery to one who had been true and generous to him, but whose least\r\nproud word and look he had treasured up, at interest, for years\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nfalse and subtle men will always secretly despise and dislike the\r\nobject upon which they fawn and always resent the payment and receipt\r\nof homage that they know to be worthless; these were the themes\r\nuppermost in his mind. A lurking rage against the woman who had so\r\nentrapped him and avenged herself was always there; crude and misshapen\r\nschemes of retaliation upon her, floated in his brain; but nothing was\r\ndistinct. A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts. Even\r\nwhile he was so busy with this fevered, ineffectual thinking, his one\r\nconstant idea was, that he would postpone reflection until some\r\nindefinite time.\r\n\r\nThen, the old days before the second marriage rose up in his\r\nremembrance. He thought how jealous he had been of the boy, how jealous\r\nhe had been of the girl, how artfully he had kept intruders at a\r\ndistance, and drawn a circle round his dupe that none but himself\r\nshould cross; and then he thought, had he done all this to be flying\r\nnow, like a scared thief, from only the poor dupe?\r\n\r\nHe could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice, but it was the\r\nvery shadow of his defeat, and could not be separated from it. To have\r\nhis confidence in his own knavery so shattered at a blow\xe2\x80\x94to be within\r\nhis own knowledge such a miserable tool\xe2\x80\x94was like being paralysed. With\r\nan impotent ferocity he raged at Edith, and hated Mr Dombey and hated\r\nhimself, but still he fled, and could do nothing else.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind. Again and\r\nagain his fancy heard it, coming on louder and louder. At last he was\r\nso persuaded of this, that he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cStop\xe2\x80\x9d preferring even the\r\nloss of ground to such uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe word soon brought carriage, horses, driver, all in a heap together,\r\nacross the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the driver, looking over his shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh Heaven, be quiet, cursed brigand!\xe2\x80\x9d to a horse who shook his bells\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehind. Is it not another carriage at a gallop? There! what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiscreant with a Pig\xe2\x80\x99s head, stand still!\xe2\x80\x9d to another horse, who bit\r\nanother, who frightened the other two, who plunged and backed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis nothing coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing but the day yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, I think. I hear nothing now, indeed. Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe entangled equipage, half hidden in the reeking cloud from the\r\nhorses, goes on slowly at first, for the driver, checked unnecessarily\r\nin his progress, sulkily takes out a pocket-knife, and puts a new lash\r\nto his whip. Then \xe2\x80\x9cHallo, whoop! Hallo, hi!\xe2\x80\x9d Away once more, savagely.\r\n\r\nAnd now the stars faded, and the day glimmered, and standing in the\r\ncarriage, looking back, he could discern the track by which he had\r\ncome, and see that there was no traveller within view, on all the heavy\r\nexpanse. And soon it was broad day, and the sun began to shine on\r\ncornfields and vineyards; and solitary labourers, risen from little\r\ntemporary huts by heaps of stones upon the road, were, here and there,\r\nat work repairing the highway, or eating bread. By and by, there were\r\npeasants going to their daily labour, or to market, or lounging at the\r\ndoors of poor cottages, gazing idly at him as he passed. And then there\r\nwas a postyard, ankle-deep in mud, with steaming dunghills and vast\r\nouthouses half ruined; and looking on this dainty prospect, an immense,\r\nold, shadeless, glaring, stone chateau, with half its windows blinded,\r\nand green damp crawling lazily over it, from the balustraded terrace to\r\nthe taper tips of the extinguishers upon the turrets.\r\n\r\nGathered up moodily in a corner of the carriage, and only intent on\r\ngoing fast\xe2\x80\x94except when he stood up, for a mile together, and looked\r\nback; which he would do whenever there was a piece of open country\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwent on, still postponing thought indefinitely, and still always\r\ntormented with thinking to no purpose.\r\n\r\nShame, disappointment, and discomfiture gnawed at his heart; a constant\r\napprehension of being overtaken, or met\xe2\x80\x94for he was groundlessly afraid\r\neven of travellers, who came towards him by the way he was\r\ngoing\xe2\x80\x94oppressed him heavily. The same intolerable awe and dread that\r\nhad come upon him in the night, returned unweakened in the day. The\r\nmonotonous ringing of the bells and tramping of the horses; the\r\nmonotony of his anxiety, and useless rage; the monotonous wheel of\r\nfear, regret, and passion, he kept turning round and round; made the\r\njourney like a vision, in which nothing was quite real but his own\r\ntorment.\r\n\r\nIt was a vision of long roads, that stretched away to an horizon,\r\nalways receding and never gained; of ill-paved towns, up hill and down,\r\nwhere faces came to dark doors and ill-glazed windows, and where rows\r\nof mudbespattered cows and oxen were tied up for sale in the long\r\nnarrow streets, butting and lowing, and receiving blows on their blunt\r\nheads from bludgeons that might have beaten them in; of bridges,\r\ncrosses, churches, postyards, new horses being put in against their\r\nwills, and the horses of the last stage reeking, panting, and laying\r\ntheir drooping heads together dolefully at stable doors; of little\r\ncemeteries with black crosses settled sideways in the graves, and\r\nwithered wreaths upon them dropping away; again of long, long roads,\r\ndragging themselves out, up hill and down, to the treacherous horizon.\r\n\r\nOf morning, noon, and sunset; night, and the rising of an early moon.\r\nOf long roads temporarily left behind, and a rough pavement reached; of\r\nbattering and clattering over it, and looking up, among house-roofs, at\r\na great church-tower; of getting out and eating hastily, and drinking\r\ndraughts of wine that had no cheering influence; of coming forth afoot,\r\namong a host of beggars\xe2\x80\x94blind men with quivering eyelids, led by old\r\nwomen holding candles to their faces; idiot girls; the lame, the\r\nepileptic, and the palsied\xe2\x80\x94of passing through the clamour, and looking\r\nfrom his seat at the upturned countenances and outstretched hands, with\r\na hurried dread of recognising some pursuer pressing forward\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ngalloping away again, upon the long, long road, gathered up, dull and\r\nstunned, in his corner, or rising to see where the moon shone faintly\r\non a patch of the same endless road miles away, or looking back to see\r\nwho followed.\r\n\r\nOf never sleeping, but sometimes dozing with unclosed eyes, and\r\nspringing up with a start, and a reply aloud to an imaginary voice. Of\r\ncursing himself for being there, for having fled, for having let her\r\ngo, for not having confronted and defied him. Of having a deadly\r\nquarrel with the whole world, but chiefly with himself. Of blighting\r\neverything with his black mood as he was carried on and away.\r\n\r\nIt was a fevered vision of things past and present all confounded\r\ntogether; of his life and journey blended into one. Of being madly\r\nhurried somewhere, whither he must go. Of old scenes starting up among\r\nthe novelties through which he travelled. Of musing and brooding over\r\nwhat was past and distant, and seeming to take no notice of the actual\r\nobjects he encountered, but with a wearisome exhausting consciousness\r\nof being bewildered by them, and having their images all crowded in his\r\nhot brain after they were gone.\r\n\r\nA vision of change upon change, and still the same monotony of bells\r\nand wheels, and horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and no rest. Of town and country,\r\npostyards, horses, drivers, hill and valley, light and darkness, road\r\nand pavement, height and hollow, wet weather and dry, and still the\r\nsame monotony of bells and wheels, and horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and no rest. A\r\nvision of tending on at last, towards the distant capital, by busier\r\nroads, and sweeping round, by old cathedrals, and dashing through small\r\ntowns and villages, less thinly scattered on the road than formerly,\r\nand sitting shrouded in his corner, with his cloak up to his face, as\r\npeople passing by looked at him.\r\n\r\nOf rolling on and on, always postponing thought, and always racked with\r\nthinking; of being unable to reckon up the hours he had been upon the\r\nroad, or to comprehend the points of time and place in his journey. Of\r\nbeing parched and giddy, and half mad. Of pressing on, in spite of all,\r\nas if he could not stop, and coming into Paris, where the turbid river\r\nheld its swift course undisturbed, between two brawling streams of life\r\nand motion.\r\n\r\nA troubled vision, then, of bridges, quays, interminable streets; of\r\nwine-shops, water-carriers, great crowds of people, soldiers, coaches,\r\nmilitary drums, arcades. Of the monotony of bells and wheels and\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 feet being at length lost in the universal din and uproar. Of\r\nthe gradual subsidence of that noise as he passed out in another\r\ncarriage by a different barrier from that by which he had entered. Of\r\nthe restoration, as he travelled on towards the seacoast, of the\r\nmonotony of bells and wheels, and horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and no rest.\r\n\r\nOf sunset once again, and nightfall. Of long roads again, and dead of\r\nnight, and feeble lights in windows by the roadside; and still the old\r\nmonotony of bells and wheels, and horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and no rest. Of dawn,\r\nand daybreak, and the rising of the sun. Of tolling slowly up a hill,\r\nand feeling on its top the fresh sea-breeze; and seeing the morning\r\nlight upon the edges of the distant waves. Of coming down into a\r\nharbour when the tide was at its full, and seeing fishing-boats float\r\non, and glad women and children waiting for them. Of nets and seamen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes spread out to dry upon the shore; of busy sailors, and their\r\nvoices high among ships\xe2\x80\x99 masts and rigging; of the buoyancy and\r\nbrightness of the water, and the universal sparkling.\r\n\r\nOf receding from the coast, and looking back upon it from the deck when\r\nit was a haze upon the water, with here and there a little opening of\r\nbright land where the Sun struck. Of the swell, and flash, and murmur\r\nof the calm sea. Of another grey line on the ocean, on the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrack, fast growing clearer and higher. Of cliffs and buildings, and a\r\nwindmill, and a church, becoming more and more visible upon it. Of\r\nsteaming on at last into smooth water, and mooring to a pier whence\r\ngroups of people looked down, greeting friends on board. Of\r\ndisembarking, passing among them quickly, shunning every one; and of\r\nbeing at last again in England.\r\n\r\nHe had thought, in his dream, of going down into a remote country-place\r\nhe knew, and lying quiet there, while he secretly informed himself of\r\nwhat transpired, and determined how to act, Still in the same stunned\r\ncondition, he remembered a certain station on the railway, where he\r\nwould have to branch off to his place of destination, and where there\r\nwas a quiet Inn. Here, he indistinctly resolved to tarry and rest.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose he slunk into a railway carriage as quickly as he\r\ncould, and lying there wrapped in his cloak as if he were asleep, was\r\nsoon borne far away from the sea, and deep into the inland green.\r\nArrived at his destination he looked out, and surveyed it carefully. He\r\nwas not mistaken in his impression of the place. It was a retired spot,\r\non the borders of a little wood. Only one house, newly-built or altered\r\nfor the purpose, stood there, surrounded by its neat garden; the small\r\ntown that was nearest, was some miles away. Here he alighted then; and\r\ngoing straight into the tavern, unobserved by anyone, secured two rooms\r\nupstairs communicating with each other, and sufficiently retired.\r\n\r\nHis object was to rest, and recover the command of himself, and the\r\nbalance of his mind. Imbecile discomfiture and rage\xe2\x80\x94so that, as he\r\nwalked about his room, he ground his teeth\xe2\x80\x94had complete possession of\r\nhim. His thoughts, not to be stopped or directed, still wandered where\r\nthey would, and dragged him after them. He was stupefied, and he was\r\nwearied to death.\r\n\r\nBut, as if there were a curse upon him that he should never rest again,\r\nhis drowsy senses would not lose their consciousness. He had no more\r\ninfluence with them, in this regard, than if they had been another\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s. It was not that they forced him to take note of present sounds\r\nand objects, but that they would not be diverted from the whole hurried\r\nvision of his journey. It was constantly before him all at once. She\r\nstood there, with her dark disdainful eyes again upon him; and he was\r\nriding on nevertheless, through town and country, light and darkness,\r\nwet weather and dry, over road and pavement, hill and valley, height\r\nand hollow, jaded and scared by the monotony of bells and wheels, and\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and no rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat day is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of the waiter, who was making preparations\r\nfor his dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Wednesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday, Sir? No, Sir. Thursday, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot. How goes the time? My watch is unwound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants a few minutes of five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Sir. Been travelling a long time,\r\nSir, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy rail, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery confusing, Sir. Not much in the habit of travelling by rail\r\nmyself, Sir, but gentlemen frequently say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo many gentlemen come here?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, Sir, in general. Nobody here at present. Rather slack\r\njust now, Sir. Everything is slack, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer; but had risen into a sitting posture on the sofa\r\nwhere he had been lying, and leaned forward with an arm on each knee,\r\nstaring at the ground. He could not master his own attention for a\r\nminute together. It rushed away where it would, but it never, for an\r\ninstant, lost itself in sleep.\r\n\r\nHe drank a quantity of wine after dinner, in vain. No such artificial\r\nmeans would bring sleep to his eyes. His thoughts, more incoherent,\r\ndragged him more unmercifully after them\xe2\x80\x94as if a wretch, condemned to\r\nsuch expiation, were drawn at the heels of wild horses. No oblivion,\r\nand no rest.\r\n\r\nHow long he sat, drinking and brooding, and being dragged in\r\nimagination hither and thither, no one could have told less correctly\r\nthan he. But he knew that he had been sitting a long time by\r\ncandle-light, when he started up and listened, in a sudden terror.\r\n\r\nFor now, indeed, it was no fancy. The ground shook, the house rattled,\r\nthe fierce impetuous rush was in the air! He felt it come up, and go\r\ndarting by; and even when he had hurried to the window, and saw what it\r\nwas, he stood, shrinking from it, as if it were not safe to look.\r\n\r\nA curse upon the fiery devil, thundering along so smoothly, tracked\r\nthrough the distant valley by a glare of light and lurid smoke, and\r\ngone! He felt as if he had been plucked out of its path, and saved from\r\nbeing torn asunder. It made him shrink and shudder even now, when its\r\nfaintest hum was hushed, and when the lines of iron road he could trace\r\nin the moonlight, running to a point, were as empty and as silent as a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nUnable to rest, and irresistibly attracted\xe2\x80\x94or he thought so\xe2\x80\x94to this\r\nroad, he went out, and lounged on the brink of it, marking the way the\r\ntrain had gone, by the yet smoking cinders that were lying in its\r\ntrack. After a lounge of some half hour in the direction by which it\r\nhad disappeared, he turned and walked the other way\xe2\x80\x94still keeping to\r\nthe brink of the road\xe2\x80\x94past the inn garden, and a long way down; looking\r\ncuriously at the bridges, signals, lamps, and wondering when another\r\nDevil would come by.\r\n\r\nA trembling of the ground, and quick vibration in his ears; a distant\r\nshriek; a dull light advancing, quickly changed to two red eyes, and a\r\nfierce fire, dropping glowing coals; an irresistible bearing on of a\r\ngreat roaring and dilating mass; a high wind, and a rattle\xe2\x80\x94another come\r\nand gone, and he holding to a gate, as if to save himself!\r\n\r\nHe waited for another, and for another. He walked back to his former\r\npoint, and back again to that, and still, through the wearisome vision\r\nof his journey, looked for these approaching monsters. He loitered\r\nabout the station, waiting until one should stay to call there; and\r\nwhen one did, and was detached for water, he stood parallel with it,\r\nwatching its heavy wheels and brazen front, and thinking what a cruel\r\npower and might it had. Ugh! To see the great wheels slowly turning,\r\nand to think of being run down and crushed!\r\n\r\nDisordered with wine and want of rest\xe2\x80\x94that want which nothing, although\r\nhe was so weary, would appease\xe2\x80\x94these ideas and objects assumed a\r\ndiseased importance in his thoughts. When he went back to his room,\r\nwhich was not until near midnight, they still haunted him, and he sat\r\nlistening for the coming of another.\r\n\r\nSo in his bed, whither he repaired with no hope of sleep. He still lay\r\nlistening; and when he felt the trembling and vibration, got up and\r\nwent to the window, to watch (as he could from its position) the dull\r\nlight changing to the two red eyes, and the fierce fire dropping\r\nglowing coals, and the rush of the giant as it fled past, and the track\r\nof glare and smoke along the valley. Then he would glance in the\r\ndirection by which he intended to depart at sunrise, as there was no\r\nrest for him there; and would lie down again, to be troubled by the\r\nvision of his journey, and the old monotony of bells and wheels and\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, until another came. This lasted all night. So far from\r\nresuming the mastery of himself, he seemed, if possible, to lose it\r\nmore and more, as the night crept on. When the dawn appeared, he was\r\nstill tormented with thinking, still postponing thought until he should\r\nbe in a better state; the past, present, and future all floated\r\nconfusedly before him, and he had lost all power of looking steadily at\r\nany one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the man who had waited on him over-night, now\r\nentering with a candle, \xe2\x80\x9cdo I leave here, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a quarter after four, Sir. Express comes through at four,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x94It don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand across his throbbing head, and looked at his watch.\r\nNearly half-past three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody going with you, Sir, probably,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the man. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo\r\ngentlemen here, Sir, but they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the train to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said there was nobody here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carker, turning upon\r\nhim with the ghost of his old smile, when he was angry or suspicious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot then, sir. Two gentlemen came in the night by the short train that\r\nstops here, Sir. Warm water, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and take away the candle. There\xe2\x80\x99s day enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thrown himself upon the bed, half-dressed he was at the window\r\nas the man left the room. The cold light of morning had succeeded to\r\nnight and there was already, in the sky, the red suffusion of the\r\ncoming sun. He bathed his head and face with water\xe2\x80\x94there was no cooling\r\ninfluence in it for him\xe2\x80\x94hurriedly put on his clothes, paid what he\r\nowed, and went out.\r\n\r\nThe air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him. There was\r\na heavy dew; and, hot as he was, it made him shiver. After a glance at\r\nthe place where he had walked last night, and at the signal-lights\r\nburning in the morning, and bereft of their significance, he turned to\r\nwhere the sun was rising, and beheld it, in its glory, as it broke upon\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nSo awful, so transcendent in its beauty, so divinely solemn. As he cast\r\nhis faded eyes upon it, where it rose, tranquil and serene, unmoved by\r\nall the wrong and wickedness on which its beams had shone since the\r\nbeginning of the world, who shall say that some weak sense of virtue\r\nupon Earth, and its in Heaven, did not manifest itself, even to him? If\r\never he remembered sister or brother with a touch of tenderness and\r\nremorse, who shall say it was not then?\r\n\r\nHe needed some such touch then. Death was on him. He was marked off\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nliving world, and going down into his grave.\r\n\r\nHe paid the money for his journey to the country-place he had thought\r\nof; and was walking to and fro, alone, looking along the lines of iron,\r\nacross the valley in one direction, and towards a dark bridge near at\r\nhand in the other; when, turning in his walk, where it was bounded by\r\none end of the wooden stage on which he paced up and down, he saw the\r\nman from whom he had fled, emerging from the door by which he himself\r\nhad entered. And their eyes met.\r\n\r\nIn the quick unsteadiness of the surprise, he staggered, and slipped on\r\nto the road below him. But recovering his feet immediately, he stepped\r\nback a pace or two upon that road, to interpose some wider space\r\nbetween them, and looked at his pursuer, breathing short and quick.\r\n\r\nHe heard a shout\xe2\x80\x94another\xe2\x80\x94saw the face change from its vindictive\r\npassion to a faint sickness and terror\xe2\x80\x94felt the earth tremble\xe2\x80\x94knew in a\r\nmoment that the rush was come\xe2\x80\x94uttered a shriek\xe2\x80\x94looked round\xe2\x80\x94saw the red\r\neyes, bleared and dim, in the daylight, close upon him\xe2\x80\x94was beaten down,\r\ncaught up, and whirled away upon a jagged mill, that spun him round and\r\nround, and struck him limb from limb, and licked his stream of life up\r\nwith its fiery heat, and cast his mutilated fragments in the air.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller, who had been recognised, recovered from a swoon, he\r\nsaw them bringing from a distance something covered, that lay heavy and\r\nstill, upon a board, between four men, and saw that others drove some\r\ndogs away that sniffed upon the road, and soaked his blood up, with a\r\ntrain of ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\nSeveral People delighted, and the Game Chicken disgusted\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Midshipman was all alive. Mr Toots and Susan had arrived at last.\r\nSusan had run upstairs like a young woman bereft of her senses, and Mr\r\nToots and the Chicken had gone into the Parlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my own pretty darling sweet Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Nipper, running\r\ninto Florence\xe2\x80\x99s room, \xe2\x80\x9cto think that it should come to this and I\r\nshould find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and\r\nno home to call your own but never never will I go away again Miss Floy\r\nfor though I may not gather moss I\xe2\x80\x99m not a rolling stone nor is my\r\nheart a stone or else it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPouring out these words, without the faintest indication of a stop, of\r\nany sort, Miss Nipper, on her knees beside her mistress, hugged her\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh love!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI know all that\xe2\x80\x99s past I know it all my tender\r\npet and I\xe2\x80\x99m a choking give me air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan, dear good Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bless her! I that was her little maid when she was a little child!\r\nand is she really, really truly going to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan,\r\nin a burst of pain and pleasure, pride and grief, and Heaven knows how\r\nmany other conflicting feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh gracious me! that innocentest creetur Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Susan\r\nhysterically. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew he must be right my dear, because he took on so.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s the devotedest and innocentest infant! And is my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nSusan, with another close embrace and burst of tears, \xe2\x80\x9creally really\r\ngoing to be married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mixture of compassion, pleasure, tenderness, protection, and regret\r\nwith which the Nipper constantly recurred to this subject, and at every\r\nsuch once, raised her head to look in the young face and kiss it, and\r\nthen laid her head again upon her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, caressing her\r\nand sobbing, was as womanly and good a thing, in its way, as ever was\r\nseen in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soothing voice of Florence presently. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re quite yourself, dear Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper, sitting down upon the floor, at her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\nlaughing and sobbing, holding her pocket-handkerchief to her eyes with\r\none hand, and patting Diogenes with the other as he licked her face,\r\nconfessed to being more composed, and laughed and cried a little more\r\nin proof of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI-I-I never did see such a creetur as that Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cin all\r\nmy born days never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo kind,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so comic!\xe2\x80\x9d Susan sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way he\xe2\x80\x99s been going on inside with\r\nme with that disrespectable Chicken on the box!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Florence, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh about Lieutenant Walters, and Captain Gills, and you my dear Miss\r\nFloy, and the silent tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe silent tomb!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says,\xe2\x80\x9d here Susan burst into a violent hysterical laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll go down into it now immediately and quite comfortable, but bless\r\nyour heart my dear Miss Floy he won\xe2\x80\x99t, he\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal too happy in\r\nseeing other people happy for that, he may not be a Solomon,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nthe Nipper, with her usual volubility, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I say he is but this I\r\ndo say a less selfish human creature human nature never knew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper being still hysterical, laughed immoderately after making\r\nthis energetic declaration, and then informed Florence that he was\r\nwaiting below to see her; which would be a rich repayment for the\r\ntrouble he had had in his late expedition.\r\n\r\nFlorence entreated Susan to beg of Mr Toots as a favour that she might\r\nhave the pleasure of thanking him for his kindness; and Susan, in a few\r\nmoments, produced that young gentleman, still very much dishevelled in\r\nappearance, and stammering exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be again permitted to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94gaze\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, not to gaze, but\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what I was going to say,\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to thank you so often,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence, giving him both her\r\nhands, with all her innocent gratitude beaming in her face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhave no words left, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, in an awful voice, \xe2\x80\x9cif it was possible\r\nthat you could, consistently with your angelic nature, Curse me, you\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94if I may be allowed to say so\xe2\x80\x94floor me infinitely less, than by\r\nthese undeserved expressions of kindness Their effect upon me\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94but,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Toots, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a digression, and of no consequence\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs there seemed to be no means of replying to this, but by thanking him\r\nagain, Florence thanked him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cto take this opportunity, Miss Dombey,\r\nif I might, of entering into a word of explanation. I should have had\r\nthe pleasure of\xe2\x80\x94of returning with Susan at an earlier period; but, in\r\nthe first place, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the name of the relation to whose house\r\nshe had gone, and, in the second, as she had left that relation\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\ngone to another at a distance, I think that scarcely anything short of\r\nthe sagacity of the Chicken, would have found her out in the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence was sure of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cis not the point. The company of Susan\r\nhas been, I assure you, Miss Dombey, a consolation and satisfaction to\r\nme, in my state of mind, more easily conceived than described. The\r\njourney has been its own reward. That, however, still, is not the\r\npoint. Miss Dombey, I have before observed that I know I am not what is\r\nconsidered a quick person. I am perfectly aware of that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nanybody could be better acquainted with his own\xe2\x80\x94if it was not too\r\nstrong an expression, I should say with the thickness of his own\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94than myself. But, Miss Dombey, I do, notwithstanding, perceive the\r\nstate of\xe2\x80\x94of things\xe2\x80\x94with Lieutenant Walters. Whatever agony that state\r\nof things may have caused me (which is of no consequence at all), I am\r\nbound to say, that Lieutenant Walters is a person who appears to be\r\nworthy of the blessing that has fallen on his\xe2\x80\x94on his brow. May he wear\r\nit long, and appreciate it, as a very different, and very unworthy\r\nindividual, that it is of no consequence to name, would have done!\r\nThat, however, still, is not the point. Miss Dombey, Captain Gills is a\r\nfriend of mine; and during the interval that is now elapsing, I believe\r\nit would afford Captain Gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming\r\nbackwards and forwards here. It would afford me pleasure so to come.\r\nBut I cannot forget that I once committed myself, fatally, at the\r\ncorner of the Square at Brighton; and if my presence will be, in the\r\nleast degree, unpleasant to you, I only ask you to name it to me now,\r\nand assure you that I shall perfectly understand you. I shall not\r\nconsider it at all unkind, and shall only be too delighted and happy to\r\nbe honoured with your confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cif you, who are so old and true a\r\nfriend of mine, were to stay away from this house now, you would make\r\nme very unhappy. It can never, never, give me any feeling but pleasure\r\nto see you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, taking out his pocket-handkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\nshed a tear, it is a tear of joy. It is of no consequence, and I am\r\nvery much obliged to you. I may be allowed to remark, after what you\r\nhave so kindly said, that it is not my intention to neglect my person\r\nany longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence received this intimation with the prettiest expression of\r\nperplexity possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall consider it my duty as a\r\nfellow-creature generally, until I am claimed by the silent tomb, to\r\nmake the best of myself, and to\xe2\x80\x94to have my boots as brightly polished,\r\nas\xe2\x80\x94as\xe2\x80\x94circumstances will admit of. This is the last time, Miss Dombey,\r\nof my intruding any observation of a private and personal nature. I\r\nthank you very much indeed. If I am not, in a general way, as sensible\r\nas my friends could wish me to be, or as I could wish myself, I really\r\nam, upon my word and honour, particularly sensible of what is\r\nconsiderate and kind. I feel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, in an impassioned tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas if I could express my feelings, at the present moment, in a most\r\nremarkable manner, if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94I could only get a start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAppearing not to get it, after waiting a minute or two to see if it\r\nwould come, Mr Toots took a hasty leave, and went below to seek the\r\nCaptain, whom he found in the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is now to take place between us,\r\ntakes place under the sacred seal of confidence. It is the sequel,\r\nCaptain Gills, of what has taken place between myself and Miss Dombey,\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlow and aloft, eh, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, whose fervour of\r\nacquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey, I believe, Captain Gills, is to be\r\nshortly united to Lieutenant Walters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ay, my lad. We\xe2\x80\x99re all shipmets here,\xe2\x80\x94Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr and sweet\xe2\x80\x94heart will\r\nbe jined together in the house of bondage, as soon as the askings is\r\nover,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Captain Cuttle, in his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe askings, Captain Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the church, down yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, pointing his thumb over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, in his hoarse whisper, and tapping Mr\r\nToots on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling from him with\r\na look of infinite admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat follers? That there pretty\r\ncreetur, as delicately brought up as a foreign bird, goes away upon the\r\nroaring main with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr on a woyage to China!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Captain Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d nodded the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ship as took him up, when he was wrecked\r\nin the hurricane that had drove her clean out of her course, was a\r\nChina trader, and Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr made the woyage, and got into favour, aboard\r\nand ashore\xe2\x80\x94being as smart and good a lad as ever stepped\xe2\x80\x94and so, the\r\nsupercargo dying at Canton, he got made (having acted as clerk afore),\r\nand now he\xe2\x80\x99s supercargo aboard another ship, same owners. And so, you\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Captain, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pretty creetur goes away\r\nupon the roaring main with Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr, on a woyage to China.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots and Captain Cuttle heaved a sigh in concert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe loves him true. He loves her true. Them as should\r\nhave loved and tended of her, treated of her like the beasts as perish.\r\nWhen she, cast out of home, come here to me, and dropped upon them\r\nplanks, her wownded heart was broke. I know it. I, Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, see\r\nit. There\xe2\x80\x99s nowt but true, kind, steady love, as can ever piece it up\r\nagain. If so be I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know as Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr was her\r\ntrue love, brother, and she his, I\xe2\x80\x99d have these here blue arms and legs\r\nchopped off, afore I\xe2\x80\x99d let her go. But I know it, and what then! Why,\r\nthen, I say, Heaven go with \xe2\x80\x99em both, and so it will! Amen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9clet me have the pleasure of shaking\r\nhands. You\xe2\x80\x99ve a way of saying things, that gives me an agreeable warmth,\r\nall up my back. _I_ say Amen. You are aware, Captain Gills, that I,\r\ntoo, have adored Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, laying his hand on Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my intention, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the spirited Mr Toots,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto cheer up. Also to standby, as much as possible. When the silent\r\ntomb shall yawn, Captain Gills, I shall be ready for burial; not\r\nbefore. But not being certain, just at present, of my power over\r\nmyself, what I wish to say to you, and what I shall take it as a\r\nparticular favour if you will mention to Lieutenant Walters, is as\r\nfollows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs as follers,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dombey being so inexpressably kind,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Toots with\r\nwatery eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cas to say that my presence is the reverse of disagreeable\r\nto her, and you and everybody here being no less forbearing and\r\ntolerant towards one who\xe2\x80\x94who certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, with momentary\r\ndejection, \xe2\x80\x9cwould appear to have been born by mistake, I shall come\r\nbackwards and forwards of an evening, during the short time we can all\r\nbe together. But what I ask is this. If, at any moment, I find that I\r\ncannot endure the contemplation of Lieutenant Walters\xe2\x80\x99s bliss, and\r\nshould rush out, I hope, Captain Gills, that you and he will both\r\nconsider it as my misfortune and not my fault, or the want of inward\r\nconflict. That you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel convinced I bear no malice to any living\r\ncreature-least of all to Lieutenant Walters himself\xe2\x80\x94and that you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncasually remark that I have gone out for a walk, or probably to see\r\nwhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock it is by the Royal Exchange. Captain Gills, if you could\r\nenter into this arrangement, and could answer for Lieutenant Walters,\r\nit would be a relief to my feelings that I should think cheap at the\r\nsacrifice of a considerable portion of my property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9csay no more. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a colour you\r\ncan run up, as won\xe2\x80\x99t be made out, and answered to, by Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr and self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mind is greatly relieved. I wish to\r\npreserve the good opinion of all here. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94mean well, upon my honour,\r\nhowever badly I may show it. You know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s as exactly\r\nas Burgess and Co. wished to oblige a customer with a most\r\nextraordinary pair of trousers, and could not cut out what they had in\r\ntheir minds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this apposite illustration, of which he seemed a little Proud, Mr\r\nToots gave Captain Cuttle his blessing and departed.\r\n\r\nThe honest Captain, with his Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight in the house, and Susan\r\ntending her, was a beaming and a happy man. As the days flew by, he\r\ngrew more beaming and more happy, every day. After some conferences\r\nwith Susan (for whose wisdom the Captain had a profound respect, and\r\nwhose valiant precipitation of herself on Mrs MacStinger he could never\r\nforget), he proposed to Florence that the daughter of the elderly lady\r\nwho usually sat under the blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market, should,\r\nfor prudential reasons and considerations of privacy, be superseded in\r\nthe temporary discharge of the household duties, by someone who was not\r\nunknown to them, and in whom they could safely confide. Susan, being\r\npresent, then named, in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously\r\noffered to the Captain, Mrs Richards. Florence brightened at the name.\r\nAnd Susan, setting off that very afternoon to the Toodle domicile, to\r\nsound Mrs Richards, returned in triumph the same evening, accompanied\r\nby the identical rosy-cheeked apple-faced Polly, whose demonstrations,\r\nwhen brought into Florence\xe2\x80\x99s presence, were hardly less affectionate\r\nthan those of Susan Nipper herself.\r\n\r\nThis piece of generalship accomplished; from which the Captain derived\r\nuncommon satisfaction, as he did, indeed, from everything else that was\r\ndone, whatever it happened to be; Florence had next to prepare Susan\r\nfor their approaching separation. This was a much more difficult task,\r\nas Miss Nipper was of a resolute disposition, and had fully made up her\r\nmind that she had come back never to be parted from her old mistress\r\nany more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to wages dear Miss Floy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hint and wrong me\r\nso as think of naming them, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve put money by and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell my\r\nlove and duty at a time like this even if the Savings\xe2\x80\x99 Banks and me\r\nwere total strangers or the Banks were broke to pieces, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever been without me darling from the time your poor dear Ma was took\r\naway, and though I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing to be boasted of you\xe2\x80\x99re used to me and oh\r\nmy own dear mistress through so many years don\xe2\x80\x99t think of going\r\nanywhere without me, for it mustn\xe2\x80\x99t and can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Susan, I am going on a long, long voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell Miss Floy, and what of that? the more you\xe2\x80\x99ll want me. Lengths of\r\nvoyages ain\xe2\x80\x99t an object in my eyes, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the impetuous\r\nSusan Nipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Susan, I am going with Walter, and I would go with Walter\r\nanywhere\xe2\x80\x94everywhere! Walter is poor, and I am very poor, and I must\r\nlearn, now, both to help myself, and help him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, bursting out afresh, and shaking her\r\nhead violently, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new to you to help yourself and others\r\ntoo and be the patientest and truest of noble hearts, but let me talk\r\nto Mr Walter Gay and settle it with him, for suffer you to go away\r\nacross the world alone I cannot, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cAlone? and Walter taking me with\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, what a bright, amazed, enraptured smile was on her face!\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nshould have seen it. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you will not speak to Walter if I ask\r\nyou not,\xe2\x80\x9d she added tenderly; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan sobbed \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Miss Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be his wife, to give him up my\r\nwhole heart, and to live with him and die with him. He might think, if\r\nyou said to him what you have said to me, that I am afraid of what is\r\nbefore me, or that you have some cause to be afraid for me. Why, Susan,\r\ndear, I love him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper was so much affected by the quiet fervour of these words,\r\nand the simple, heartfelt, all-pervading earnestness expressed in them,\r\nand making the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s face more beautiful and pure than ever, that\r\nshe could only cling to her again, crying. Was her little mistress\r\nreally, really going to be married, and pitying, caressing, and\r\nprotecting her, as she had done before.\r\n\r\nBut the Nipper, though susceptible of womanly weaknesses, was almost as\r\ncapable of putting constraint upon herself as of attacking the\r\nredoubtable MacStinger. From that time, she never returned to the\r\nsubject, but was always cheerful, active, bustling, and hopeful. She\r\ndid, indeed, inform Mr Toots privately, that she was only \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping up\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor the time, and that when it was all over, and Miss Dombey was gone,\r\nshe might be expected to become a spectacle distressful; and Mr Toots\r\ndid also express that it was his case too, and that they would mingle\r\ntheir tears together; but she never otherwise indulged her private\r\nfeelings in the presence of Florence or within the precincts of the\r\nMidshipman.\r\n\r\nLimited and plain as Florence\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe was\xe2\x80\x94what a contrast to that\r\nprepared for the last marriage in which she had taken part!\xe2\x80\x94there was a\r\ngood deal to do in getting it ready, and Susan Nipper worked away at\r\nher side, all day, with the concentrated zeal of fifty sempstresses.\r\nThe wonderful contributions Captain Cuttle would have made to this\r\nbranch of the outfit, if he had been permitted\xe2\x80\x94as pink parasols, tinted\r\nsilk stockings, blue shoes, and other articles no less necessary on\r\nshipboard\xe2\x80\x94would occupy some space in the recital. He was induced,\r\nhowever, by various fraudulent representations, to limit his\r\ncontributions to a work-box and dressing case, of each of which he\r\npurchased the very largest specimen that could be got for money. For\r\nten days or a fortnight afterwards, he generally sat, during the\r\ngreater part of the day, gazing at these boxes; divided between extreme\r\nadmiration of them, and dejected misgivings that they were not gorgeous\r\nenough, and frequently diving out into the street to purchase some wild\r\narticle that he deemed necessary to their completeness. But his\r\nmaster-stroke was, the bearing of them both off, suddenly, one morning,\r\nand getting the two words FLORENCE GAY engraved upon a brass heart\r\ninlaid over the lid of each. After this, he smoked four pipes\r\nsuccessively in the little parlour by himself, and was discovered\r\nchuckling, at the expiration of as many hours.\r\n\r\nWalter was busy and away all day, but came there every morning early to\r\nsee Florence, and always passed the evening with her. Florence never\r\nleft her high rooms but to steal downstairs to wait for him when it was\r\nhis time to come, or, sheltered by his proud, encircling arm, to bear\r\nhim company to the door again, and sometimes peep into the street. In\r\nthe twilight they were always together. Oh blessed time! Oh wandering\r\nheart at rest! Oh deep, exhaustless, mighty well of love, in which so\r\nmuch was sunk!\r\n\r\nThe cruel mark was on her bosom yet. It rose against her father with\r\nthe breath she drew, it lay between her and her lover when he pressed\r\nher to his heart. But she forgot it. In the beating of that heart for\r\nher, and in the beating of her own for him, all harsher music was\r\nunheard, all stern unloving hearts forgotten. Fragile and delicate she\r\nwas, but with a might of love within her that could, and did, create a\r\nworld to fly to, and to rest in, out of his one image.\r\n\r\nHow often did the great house, and the old days, come before her in the\r\ntwilight time, when she was sheltered by the arm, so proud, so fond,\r\nand, creeping closer to him, shrunk within it at the recollection! How\r\noften, from remembering the night when she went down to that room and\r\nmet the never-to-be forgotten look, did she raise her eyes to those\r\nthat watched her with such loving earnestness, and weep with happiness\r\nin such a refuge! The more she clung to it, the more the dear dead\r\nchild was in her thoughts: but as if the last time she had seen her\r\nfather, had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face, she\r\nalways left him so, and never, in her fancy, passed that hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, one evening, when it was almost dark.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I have been thinking today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinking how the time is flying on, and how soon we shall be upon the\r\nsea, sweet Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, Walter, though I think of that too. I have been\r\nthinking what a charge I am to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA precious, sacred charge, dear heart! Why, I think that sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are laughing, Walter. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s much more in your thoughts\r\nthan mine. But I mean a cost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cost, my own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn money, dear. All these preparations that Susan and I are so busy\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94I have been able to purchase very little for myself. You were poor\r\nbefore. But how much poorer I shall make you, Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much richer, Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence laughed, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9clong ago\xe2\x80\x94before I went to sea\xe2\x80\x94I had a little\r\npurse presented to me, dearest, which had money in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Florence, laughing sorrowfully, \xe2\x80\x9cvery little! very\r\nlittle, Walter! But, you must not think,\xe2\x80\x9d and here she laid her light\r\nhand on his shoulder, and looked into his face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I regret to be\r\nthis burden on you. No, dear love, I am glad of it. I am happy in it. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it otherwise for all the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, indeed, dear Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! but, Walter, you can never feel it as I do. I am so proud of you!\r\nIt makes my heart swell with such delight to know that those who speak\r\nof you must say you married a poor disowned girl, who had taken shelter\r\nhere; who had no other home, no other friends; who had nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing!\r\nOh, Walter, if I could have brought you millions, I never could have\r\nbeen so happy for your sake, as I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, dear Florence? are you nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing, Walter. Nothing but your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d The light hand stole\r\nabout his neck, and the voice came nearer\xe2\x80\x94nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cI am nothing any\r\nmore, that is not you. I have no earthly hope any more, that is not\r\nyou. I have nothing dear to me any more, that is not you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh! well might Mr Toots leave the little company that evening, and\r\ntwice go out to correct his watch by the Royal Exchange, and once to\r\nkeep an appointment with a banker which he suddenly remembered, and\r\nonce to take a little turn to Aldgate Pump and back!\r\n\r\nBut before he went upon these expeditions, or indeed before he came,\r\nand before lights were brought, Walter said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, love, the lading of our ship is nearly finished, and\r\nprobably on the very day of our marriage she will drop down the river.\r\nShall we go away that morning, and stay in Kent until we go on board at\r\nGravesend within a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Walter. I shall be happy anywhere. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we shall have no marriage party, and\r\nthat nobody will distinguish us by our dress from other people. As we\r\nleave the same day, will you\xe2\x80\x94will you take me somewhere that morning,\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x94early\xe2\x80\x94before we go to church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter seemed to understand her, as so true a lover so truly loved\r\nshould, and confirmed his ready promise with a kiss\xe2\x80\x94with more than one\r\nperhaps, or two or three, or five or six; and in the grave, peaceful\r\nevening, Florence was very happy.\r\n\r\nThen into the quiet room came Susan Nipper and the candles; shortly\r\nafterwards, the tea, the Captain, and the excursive Mr Toots, who, as\r\nabove mentioned, was frequently on the move afterwards, and passed but\r\na restless evening. This, however, was not his habit: for he generally\r\ngot on very well, by dint of playing at cribbage with the Captain under\r\nthe advice and guidance of Miss Nipper, and distracting his mind with\r\nthe calculations incidental to the game; which he found to be a very\r\neffectual means of utterly confounding himself.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s visage on these occasions presented one of the finest\r\nexamples of combination and succession of expression ever observed. His\r\ninstinctive delicacy and his chivalrous feeling towards Florence,\r\ntaught him that it was not a time for any boisterous jollity, or\r\nviolent display of satisfaction; floating reminiscences of Lovely Peg,\r\non the other hand, were constantly struggling for a vent, and urging\r\nthe Captain to commit himself by some irreparable demonstration. Anon,\r\nhis admiration of Florence and Walter\xe2\x80\x94well-matched, truly, and full of\r\ngrace and interest in their youth, and love, and good looks, as they\r\nsat apart\xe2\x80\x94would take such complete possession of him, that he would lay\r\ndown his cards, and beam upon them, dabbing his head all over with his\r\npocket-handkerchief; until warned, perhaps, by the sudden rushing forth\r\nof Mr Toots, that he had unconsciously been very instrumental, indeed,\r\nin making that gentleman miserable. This reflection would make the\r\nCaptain profoundly melancholy, until the return of Mr Toots; when he\r\nwould fall to his cards again, with many side winks and nods, and\r\npolite waves of his hook at Miss Nipper, importing that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going\r\nto do so any more. The state that ensued on this, was, perhaps, his\r\nbest; for then, endeavouring to discharge all expression from his face,\r\nhe would sit staring round the room, with all these expressions\r\nconveyed into it at once, and each wrestling with the other. Delighted\r\nadmiration of Florence and Walter always overthrew the rest, and\r\nremained victorious and undisguised, unless Mr Toots made another rush\r\ninto the air, and then the Captain would sit, like a remorseful\r\nculprit, until he came back again, occasionally calling upon himself,\r\nin a low reproachful voice, to \xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d or growling some\r\nremonstrance to \xe2\x80\x9cEd\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d on the want of caution\r\nobservable in his behaviour.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s hardest trials, however, was of his own seeking. On\r\nthe approach of the Sunday which was to witness the last of those\r\naskings in church of which the Captain had spoken, Mr Toots thus stated\r\nhis feelings to Susan Nipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI am drawn towards the building. The words\r\nwhich cut me off from Miss Dombey for ever, will strike upon my ears\r\nlike a knell you know, but upon my word and honour, I feel that I must\r\nhear them. Therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you accompany me to-morrow,\r\nto the sacred edifice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper expressed her readiness to do so, if that would be any\r\nsatisfaction to Mr Toots, but besought him to abandon his idea of\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, with much solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore my whiskers\r\nbegan to be observed by anybody but myself, I adored Miss Dombey. While\r\nyet a victim to the thraldom of Blimber, I adored Miss Dombey. When I\r\ncould no longer be kept out of my property, in a legal point of view,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and accordingly came into it\xe2\x80\x94I adored Miss Dombey. The banns which\r\nconsign her to Lieutenant Walters, and me to\xe2\x80\x94to Gloom, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Toots, after hesitating for a strong expression, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be dreadful,\r\nwill be dreadful; but I feel that I should wish to hear them spoken. I\r\nfeel that I should wish to know that the ground was certainly cut from\r\nunder me, and that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a hope to cherish, or a\xe2\x80\x94or a leg, in short,\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94to go upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Nipper could only commiserate Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate condition,\r\nand agree, under these circumstances, to accompany him; which she did\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nThe church Walter had chosen for the purpose, was a mouldy old church\r\nin a yard, hemmed in by a labyrinth of back streets and courts, with a\r\nlittle burying-ground round it, and itself buried in a kind of vault,\r\nformed by the neighbouring houses, and paved with echoing stones. It\r\nwas a great dim, shabby pile, with high old oaken pews, among which\r\nabout a score of people lost themselves every Sunday; while the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness, and the\r\norgan rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic, for want\r\nof a congregation to keep the wind and damp out. But so far was this\r\ncity church from languishing for the company of other churches, that\r\nspires were clustered round it, as the masts of shipping cluster on the\r\nriver. It would have been hard to count them from its steeple-top, they\r\nwere so many. In almost every yard and blind-place near, there was a\r\nchurch. The confusion of bells when Susan and Mr Toots betook\r\nthemselves towards it on the Sunday morning, was deafening. There were\r\ntwenty churches close together, clamouring for people to come in.\r\n\r\nThe two stray sheep in question were penned by a beadle in a commodious\r\npew, and, being early, sat for some time counting the congregation,\r\nlistening to the disappointed bell high up in the tower, or looking at\r\na shabby little old man in the porch behind the screen, who was ringing\r\nthe same, like the Bull in Cock Robin, with his foot in a stirrup. Mr\r\nToots, after a lengthened survey of the large books on the\r\nreading-desk, whispered Miss Nipper that he wondered where the banns\r\nwere kept, but that young lady merely shook her head and frowned;\r\nrepelling for the time all approaches of a temporal nature.\r\n\r\nMr Toots, however, appearing unable to keep his thoughts from the\r\nbanns, was evidently looking out for them during the whole preliminary\r\nportion of the service. As the time for reading them approached, the\r\npoor young gentleman manifested great anxiety and trepidation, which\r\nwas not diminished by the unexpected apparition of the Captain in the\r\nfront row of the gallery. When the clerk handed up a list to the\r\nclergyman, Mr Toots, being then seated, held on by the seat of the pew;\r\nbut when the names of Walter Gay and Florence Dombey were read aloud as\r\nbeing in the third and last stage of that association, he was so\r\nentirley conquered by his feelings as to rush from the church without\r\nhis hat, followed by the beadle and pew-opener, and two gentlemen of\r\nthe medical profession, who happened to be present; of whom the\r\nfirst-named presently returned for that article, informing Miss Nipper\r\nin a whisper that she was not to make herself uneasy about the\r\ngentleman, as the gentleman said his indisposition was of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper, feeling that the eyes of that integral portion of Europe\r\nwhich lost itself weekly among the high-backed pews, were upon her,\r\nwould have been sufficient embarrassed by this incident, though it had\r\nterminated here; the more so, as the Captain in the front row of the\r\ngallery, was in a state of unmitigated consciousness which could hardly\r\nfail to express to the congregation that he had some mysterious\r\nconnection with it. But the extreme restlessness of Mr Toots painfully\r\nincreased and protracted the delicacy of her situation. That young\r\ngentleman, incapable, in his state of mind, of remaining alone in the\r\nchurchyard, a prey to solitary meditation, and also desirous, no doubt,\r\nof testifying his respect for the offices he had in some measure\r\ninterrupted, suddenly returned\xe2\x80\x94not coming back to the pew, but\r\nstationing himself on a free seat in the aisle, between two elderly\r\nfemales who were in the habit of receiving their portion of a weekly\r\ndole of bread then set forth on a shelf in the porch. In this\r\nconjunction Mr Toots remained, greatly disturbing the congregation, who\r\nfelt it impossible to avoid looking at him, until his feelings overcame\r\nhim again, when he departed silently and suddenly. Not venturing to\r\ntrust himself in the church any more, and yet wishing to have some\r\nsocial participation in what was going on there, Mr Toots was, after\r\nthis, seen from time to time, looking in, with a lorn aspect, at one or\r\nother of the windows; and as there were several windows accessible to\r\nhim from without, and as his restlessness was very great, it not only\r\nbecame difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next, but\r\nlikewise became necessary, as it were, for the whole congregation to\r\nspeculate upon the chances of the different windows, during the\r\ncomparative leisure afforded them by the sermon. Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s movements\r\nin the churchyard were so eccentric, that he seemed generally to defeat\r\nall calculation, and to appear, like the conjuror\xe2\x80\x99s figure, where he\r\nwas least expected; and the effect of these mysterious presentations\r\nwas much increased by its being difficult to him to see in, and easy to\r\neverybody else to see out: which occasioned his remaining, every time,\r\nlonger than might have been expected, with his face close to the glass,\r\nuntil he all at once became aware that all eyes were upon him, and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings on the part of Mr Toots, and the strong individual\r\nconsciousness of them that was exhibited by the Captain, rendered Miss\r\nNipper\xe2\x80\x99s position so responsible a one, that she was mightily relieved\r\nby the conclusion of the service; and was hardly so affable to Mr Toots\r\nas usual, when he informed her and the Captain, on the way back, that\r\nnow he was sure he had no hope, you know, he felt more comfortable\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast not exactly more comfortable, but more comfortably and completely\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nSwiftly now, indeed, the time flew by until it was the evening before\r\nthe day appointed for the marriage. They were all assembled in the\r\nupper room at the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s, and had no fear of interruption; for\r\nthere were no lodgers in the house now, and the Midshipman had it all\r\nto himself. They were grave and quiet in the prospect of to-morrow, but\r\nmoderately cheerful too. Florence, with Walter close beside her, was\r\nfinishing a little piece of work intended as a parting gift to the\r\nCaptain. The Captain was playing cribbage with Mr Toots. Mr Toots was\r\ntaking counsel as to his hand, of Susan Nipper. Miss Nipper was giving\r\nit, with all due secrecy and circumspection. Diogenes was listening,\r\nand occasionally breaking out into a gruff half-smothered fragment of a\r\nbark, of which he afterwards seemed half-ashamed, as if he doubted\r\nhaving any reason for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady, steady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain to Diogenes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s amiss with you?\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem easy in your mind tonight, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiogenes wagged his tail, but pricked up his ears immediately\r\nafterwards, and gave utterance to another fragment of a bark; for which\r\nhe apologised to the Captain, by again wagging his tail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, Di,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, looking thoughtfully at his\r\ncards, and stroking his chin with his hook, \xe2\x80\x9cas you have your doubts of\r\nMrs Richards; but if you\xe2\x80\x99re the animal I take you to be, you\xe2\x80\x99ll think\r\nbetter o\xe2\x80\x99 that; for her looks is her commission. Now, Brother:\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr\r\nToots: \xe2\x80\x9cif so be as you\xe2\x80\x99re ready, heave ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain spoke with all composure and attention to the game, but\r\nsuddenly his cards dropped out of his hand, his mouth and eyes opened\r\nwide, his legs drew themselves up and stuck out in front of his chair,\r\nand he sat staring at the door with blank amazement. Looking round upon\r\nthe company, and seeing that none of them observed him or the cause of\r\nhis astonishment, the Captain recovered himself with a great gasp,\r\nstruck the table a tremendous blow, cried in a stentorian roar, \xe2\x80\x9cSol\r\nGills ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d and tumbled into the arms of a weather-beaten pea-coat\r\nthat had come with Polly into the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn another moment, Walter was in the arms of the weather-beaten\r\npea-coat. In another moment, Florence was in the arms of the\r\nweather-beaten pea-coat. In another moment, Captain Cuttle had embraced\r\nMrs Richards and Miss Nipper, and was violently shaking hands with Mr\r\nToots, exclaiming, as he waved his hook above his head, \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, my\r\nlad, hooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d To which Mr Toots, wholly at a loss to account for these\r\nproceedings, replied with great politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Captain Gills,\r\nwhatever you think proper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weather-beaten pea-coat, and a no less weather-beaten cap and\r\ncomforter belonging to it, turned from the Captain and from Florence\r\nback to Walter, and sounds came from the weather-beaten pea-coat, cap,\r\nand comforter, as of an old man sobbing underneath them; while the\r\nshaggy sleeves clasped Walter tight. During this pause, there was an\r\nuniversal silence, and the Captain polished his nose with great\r\ndiligence. But when the pea-coat, cap, and comforter lifted themselves\r\nup again, Florence gently moved towards them; and she and Walter taking\r\nthem off, disclosed the old Instrument-maker, a little thinner and more\r\ncareworn than of old, in his old Welsh wig and his old coffee-coloured\r\ncoat and basket buttons, with his old infallible chronometer ticking\r\naway in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChock full o\xe2\x80\x99 science,\xe2\x80\x9d said the radiant Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cas ever he was! Sol\r\nGills, Sol Gills, what have you been up to, for this many a long day,\r\nmy ould boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half blind, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cand almost deaf and dumb with\r\njoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wery woice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, looking round with an exultation to\r\nwhich even his face could hardly render justice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chis wery woice as\r\nchock full o\xe2\x80\x99 science as ever it was! Sol Gills, lay to, my lad, upon\r\nyour own wines and fig-trees like a taut ould patriark as you are, and\r\noverhaul them there adwentures o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn, in your own formilior woice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTis the woice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, impressively, and announcing a\r\nquotation with his hook, \xe2\x80\x9cof the sluggard, I heerd him complain, you\r\nhave woke me too soon, I must slumber again. Scatter his ene-mies, and\r\nmake \xe2\x80\x99em fall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain sat down with the air of a man who had happily expressed\r\nthe feeling of everybody present, and immediately rose again to present\r\nMr Toots, who was much disconcerted by the arrival of anybody,\r\nappearing to prefer a claim to the name of Gills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI had not the pleasure of your\r\nacquaintance, Sir, before you were\xe2\x80\x94you were\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost to sight, to memory dear,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Captain, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so, Captain Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I had not the\r\npleasure of your acquaintance, Mr\xe2\x80\x94Mr Sols,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toots, hitting on that\r\nname in the inspiration of a bright idea, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore that happened, I have\r\nthe greatest pleasure, I assure you, in\xe2\x80\x94you know, in knowing you. I\r\nhope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99re as well as can be expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these courteous words, Mr Toots sat down blushing and chuckling.\r\n\r\nThe old Instrument-maker, seated in a corner between Walter and\r\nFlorence, and nodding at Polly, who was looking on, all smiles and\r\ndelight, answered the Captain thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNed Cuttle, my dear boy, although I have heard something of the\r\nchanges of events here, from my pleasant friend there\xe2\x80\x94what a pleasant\r\nface she has to be sure, to welcome a wanderer home!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man,\r\nbreaking off, and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain gravely. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis woman as seduces all\r\nmankind. For which,\xe2\x80\x9d aside to Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul your Adam and\r\nEve, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make a point of doing so, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I have heard something of the changes of events, from her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed the Instrument-maker, taking his old spectacles from his\r\npocket, and putting them on his forehead in his old manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are\r\nso great and unexpected, and I am so overpowered by the sight of my\r\ndear boy, and by the,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94glancing at the downcast eyes of Florence, and\r\nnot attempting to finish the sentence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t say much\r\ntonight. But my dear Ned Cuttle, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astonishment depicted in the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s features positively\r\nfrightened Mr Toots, whose eyes were quite fixed by it, so that he\r\ncould not withdraw them from his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite, Sol Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9ceither to Barbados, or Jamaica, or Demerara,\r\nthat was what I asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you asked, Sol Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Ned? Sure you have not\r\nforgotten? Every time I wrote to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain took off his glazed hat, hung it on his hook, and smoothing\r\nhis hair from behind with his hand, sat gazing at the group around him:\r\na perfect image of wondering resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to understand me, Ned!\xe2\x80\x9d observed old Sol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSol Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, after staring at him and the rest\r\nfor a long time, without speaking, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gone about and adrift. Pay out\r\na word or two respecting them adwenturs, will you! Can\xe2\x80\x99t I bring up,\r\nnohows? Nohows?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, ruminating, and staring all round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sol Gills, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I left here. Did you open my\r\npacket, Ned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, I opened the packet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd read it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd read it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain, eyeing him attentively, and\r\nproceeding to quote it from memory. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear Ned Cuttle, when I left\r\nhome for the West Indies in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear-\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThere he sits! There\xe2\x80\x99s Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, as if he were relieved\r\nby getting hold of anything that was real and indisputable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ned. Now attend a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I wrote\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94that was from Barbados\xe2\x80\x94I said that though you would receive that\r\nletter long before the year was out, I should be glad if you would open\r\nthe packet, as it explained the reason of my going away. Very good,\r\nNed. When I wrote the second, third, and perhaps the fourth times\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas from Jamaica\xe2\x80\x94I said I was in just the same state, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest,\r\nand couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come away from that part of the world, without knowing\r\nthat my boy was lost or saved. When I wrote next\xe2\x80\x94that, I think, was\r\nfrom Demerara, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he thinks was from Demerara, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nlooking hopelessly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94I said,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded old Sol, \xe2\x80\x9cthat still there was no certain\r\ninformation got yet. That I found many captains and others, in that\r\npart of the world, who had known me for years, and who assisted me with\r\na passage here and there, and for whom I was able, now and then, to do\r\na little in return, in my own craft. That everyone was sorry for me,\r\nand seemed to take a sort of interest in my wanderings; and that I\r\nbegan to think it would be my fate to cruise about in search of tidings\r\nof my boy, until I died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegan to think as how he was a scientific Flying Dutchman!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, as before, and with great seriousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when the news come one day, Ned,\xe2\x80\x94that was to Barbados, after I got\r\nback there,\xe2\x80\x94that a China trader home\xe2\x80\x99ard bound had been spoke, that had\r\nmy boy aboard, then, Ned, I took passage in the next ship and came\r\nhome; arrived at home tonight to find it true, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold man, devoutly.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, after bowing his head with great reverence, stared all\r\nround the circle, beginning with Mr Toots, and ending with the\r\nInstrument-maker; then gravely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSol Gills! The observation as I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to make is calc\xe2\x80\x99lated to\r\nblow every stitch of sail as you can carry, clean out of the\r\nbolt-ropes, and bring you on your beam ends with a lurch. Not one of\r\nthem letters was ever delivered to Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle. Not one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nletters,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Captain, to make his declaration the more solemn\r\nand impressive, \xe2\x80\x9cwas ever delivered unto Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, Mariner, of\r\nEngland, as lives at home at ease, and doth improve each shining hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd posted by my own hand! And directed by my own hand, Number nine\r\nBrig Place!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed old Sol.\r\n\r\nThe colour all went out of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s face and all came back again\r\nin a glow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Sol Gills, my friend, by Number nine Brig Place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean? Your lodgings, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs What\xe2\x80\x99s-her-name!\r\nI shall forget my own name next, but I am behind the present time\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nalways was, you recollect\xe2\x80\x94and very much confused. Mrs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSol Gills!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, as if he were putting the most\r\nimprobable case in the world, \xe2\x80\x9cit ain\xe2\x80\x99t the name of MacStinger as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a trying to remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Instrument-maker. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure Ned. Mrs\r\nMacStinger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Cuttle, whose eyes were now as wide open as they would be, and\r\nthe knobs upon whose face were perfectly luminous, gave a long shrill\r\nwhistle of a most melancholy sound, and stood gazing at everybody in a\r\nstate of speechlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverhaul that there again, Sol Gills, will you be so kind?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these letters,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Uncle Sol, beating time with the\r\nforefinger of his right hand upon the palm of his left, with a\r\nsteadiness and distinctness that might have done honour, even to the\r\ninfallible chronometer in his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cI posted with my own hand, and\r\ndirected with my own hand, to Captain Cuttle, at Mrs MacStinger\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nNumber nine Brig Place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain took his glazed hat off his hook, looked into it, put it\r\non, and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, friends all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, staring round in the last state\r\nof discomfiture, \xe2\x80\x9cI cut and run from there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no one knew where you were gone, Captain Cuttle?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walter\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your heart, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever have allowed o\xe2\x80\x99 my coming to take charge o\xe2\x80\x99 this here property.\r\nNothing could be done but cut and run. Lord love you, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen her in a calm! But see her when her angry\r\npassions rise\xe2\x80\x94and make a note on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give it her!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Nipper, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, do you think, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Captain, with feeble\r\nadmiration. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, it does you credit. But there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no wild\r\nanimal I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sooner face myself. I only got my chest away by means\r\nof a friend as nobody\xe2\x80\x99s a match for. It was no good sending any letter\r\nthere. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take in any letter, bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunder them circumstances! Why, you could hardly make it worth a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhile to be the postman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear, Captain Cuttle, that all of us, and you and\r\nUncle Sol especially,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cmay thank Mrs MacStinger for no\r\nsmall anxiety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe general obligation in this wise to the determined relict of the\r\nlate Mr MacStinger, was so apparent, that the Captain did not contest\r\nthe point; but being in some measure ashamed of his position, though\r\nnobody dwelt upon the subject, and Walter especially avoided it,\r\nremembering the last conversation he and the Captain had held together\r\nrespecting it, he remained under a cloud for nearly five minutes\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nextraordinary period for him when that sun, his face, broke out once\r\nmore, shining on all beholders with extraordinary brilliancy; and he\r\nfell into a fit of shaking hands with everybody over and over again.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour, but not before Uncle Sol and Walter had questioned\r\neach other at some length about their voyages and dangers, they all,\r\nexcept Walter, vacated Florence\xe2\x80\x99s room, and went down to the parlour.\r\nHere they were soon afterwards joined by Walter, who told them Florence\r\nwas a little sorrowful and heavy-hearted, and had gone to bed. Though\r\nthey could not have disturbed her with their voices down there, they\r\nall spoke in a whisper after this: and each, in his different way, felt\r\nvery lovingly and gently towards Walter\xe2\x80\x99s fair young bride: and a long\r\nexplanation there was of everything relating to her, for the\r\nsatisfaction of Uncle Sol; and very sensible Mr Toots was of the\r\ndelicacy with which Walter made his name and services important, and\r\nhis presence necessary to their little council.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Toots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, on parting with him at the house door, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nshall see each other to-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Walters,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, grasping his hand fervently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly be present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last night we shall meet for a long time\xe2\x80\x94the last night we\r\nmay ever meet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a noble heart as yours, must feel, I\r\nthink, when another heart is bound to it. I hope you know that I am\r\nvery grateful to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalters,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, quite touched, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad to feel\r\nthat you had reason to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9con this last night of her bearing her own\r\nname, has made me promise\xe2\x80\x94it was only just now, when you left us\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94that I would tell you\xe2\x80\x94with her dear love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots laid his hand upon the doorpost, and his eyes upon his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94With her dear love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she can never have a friend\r\nwhom she will value above you. That the recollection of your true\r\nconsideration for her always, can never be forgotten by her. That she\r\nremembers you in her prayers tonight, and hopes that you will think of\r\nher when she is far away. Shall I say anything for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots indistinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall think of\r\nher every day, but never without feeling happy to know that she is\r\nmarried to the man she loves, and who loves her. Say, if you please,\r\nthat I am sure her husband deserves her\xe2\x80\x94even her!\xe2\x80\x94and that I am glad of\r\nher choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots got more distinct as he came to these last words, and raising\r\nhis eyes from the doorpost, said them stoutly. He then shook Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand again with a fervour that Walter was not slow to return and\r\nstarted homeward.\r\n\r\nMr Toots was accompanied by the Chicken, whom he had of late brought\r\nwith him every evening, and left in the shop, with an idea that\r\nunforeseen circumstances might arise from without, in which the prowess\r\nof that distinguished character would be of service to the Midshipman.\r\nThe Chicken did not appear to be in a particularly good humour on this\r\noccasion. Either the gas-lamps were treacherous, or he cocked his eye\r\nin a hideous manner, and likewise distorted his nose, when Mr Toots,\r\ncrossing the road, looked back over his shoulder at the room where\r\nFlorence slept. On the road home, he was more demonstrative of\r\naggressive intentions against the other foot-passengers, than comported\r\nwith a professor of the peaceful art of self-defence. Arrived at home,\r\ninstead of leaving Mr Toots in his apartments when he had escorted him\r\nthither, he remained before him weighing his white hat in both hands by\r\nthe brim, and twitching his head and nose (both of which had been many\r\ntimes broken, and but indifferently repaired), with an air of decided\r\ndisrespect.\r\n\r\nHis patron being much engaged with his own thoughts, did not observe\r\nthis for some time, nor indeed until the Chicken, determined not to be\r\noverlooked, had made divers clicking sounds with his tongue and teeth,\r\nto attract attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken, doggedly, when he, at length, caught\r\nMr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s eye, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know whether this here gammon is to finish\r\nit, or whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a going in to win?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicken,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cexplain yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then, here\xe2\x80\x99s all about it, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncove to chuck a word away. Here\xe2\x80\x99s wot it is. Are any on \xe2\x80\x99em to be\r\ndoubled up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Chicken put this question he dropped his hat, made a dodge and\r\na feint with his left hand, hit a supposed enemy a violent blow with\r\nhis right, shook his head smartly, and recovered himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it to be gammon or pluck? Which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicken,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyour expressions are coarse, and your\r\nmeaning is obscure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, I tell you what, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is where\r\nit is. It\xe2\x80\x99s mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is mean, Chicken?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken, with a frightful corrugation of his broken\r\nnose. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! Now, Master! Wot! When you could go and blow on this here\r\nmatch to the stiff\xe2\x80\x99un;\xe2\x80\x9d by which depreciatory appellation it has been\r\nsince supposed that the Game One intended to signify Mr Dombey; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhen you could knock the winner and all the kit of \xe2\x80\x99em dead out o\xe2\x80\x99 wind\r\nand time, are you going to give in? To give in?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken, with\r\ncontemptuous emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cWy, it\xe2\x80\x99s mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a perfect Vulture! Your\r\nsentiments are atrocious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sentiments is Game and Fancy, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Chicken.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wot my sentiments is. I can\xe2\x80\x99t abear a meanness. I\xe2\x80\x99m afore the\r\npublic, I\xe2\x80\x99m to be heerd on at the bar of the Little Helephant, and no\r\nGov\xe2\x80\x99ner o\xe2\x80\x99 mine mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go and do what\xe2\x80\x99s mean. Wy, it\xe2\x80\x99s mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nChicken, with increased expression. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cyou disgust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Chicken, putting on his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a pair on\r\nus, then. Come! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a offer! You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoke to me more than once\xe2\x80\x9dt or\r\ntwice\xe2\x80\x99t about the public line. Never mind! Give me a fi\xe2\x80\x99typunnote\r\nto-morrow, and let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicken,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the odious sentiments you have\r\nexpressed, I shall be glad to part on such terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain. This here conduct of\r\nyourn won\xe2\x80\x99t suit my book, Master. Wy, it\xe2\x80\x99s mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chicken; who\r\nseemed equally unable to get beyond that point, and to stop short of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where it is; it\xe2\x80\x99s mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Mr Toots and the Chicken agreed to part on this incompatibility of\r\nmoral perception; and Mr Toots lying down to sleep, dreamed happily of\r\nFlorence, who had thought of him as her friend upon the last night of\r\nher maiden life, and who had sent him her dear love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nAnother Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Sownds the beadle, and Mrs Miff the pew-opener, are early at their\r\nposts in the fine church where Mr Dombey was married. A yellow-faced\r\nold gentleman from India, is going to take unto himself a young wife\r\nthis morning, and six carriages full of company are expected, and Mrs\r\nMiff has been informed that the yellow-faced old gentleman could pave\r\nthe road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them.\r\n\r\nThe nuptial benediction is to be a superior one, proceeding from a very\r\nreverend, a dean, and the lady is to be given away, as an extraordinary\r\npresent, by somebody who comes express from the Horse Guards.\r\n\r\nMrs Miff is more intolerant of common people this morning, than she\r\ngenerally is; and she has always strong opinions on that subject, for\r\nit is associated with free sittings. Mrs Miff is not a student of\r\npolitical economy (she thinks the science is connected with dissenters;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaptists or Wesleyans, or some o\xe2\x80\x99 them,\xe2\x80\x9d she says), but she can never\r\nunderstand what business your common folks have to be married. \xe2\x80\x9cDrat\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Miff \xe2\x80\x9cyou read the same things over \xe2\x80\x99em and instead of\r\nsovereigns get sixpences!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Sownds the beadle is more liberal than Mrs Miff\xe2\x80\x94but then he is not a\r\npew-opener. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be done, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must marry \xe2\x80\x99em. We\r\nmust have our national schools to walk at the head of, and we must have\r\nour standing armies. We must marry \xe2\x80\x99em, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Sownds, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nkeep the country going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Sownds is sitting on the steps and Mrs Miff is dusting in the\r\nchurch, when a young couple, plainly dressed, come in. The mortified\r\nbonnet of Mrs Miff is sharply turned towards them, for she espies in\r\nthis early visit indications of a runaway match. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nbe married\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cto walk round the church.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nas he slips a genteel compliment into the palm of Mrs Miff, her\r\nvinegary face relaxes, and her mortified bonnet and her spare dry\r\nfigure dip and crackle.\r\n\r\nMrs Miff resumes her dusting and plumps up her cushions\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nyellow-faced old gentleman is reported to have tender knees\xe2\x80\x94but keeps\r\nher glazed, pew-opening eye on the young couple who are walking round\r\nthe church. \xe2\x80\x9cAhem,\xe2\x80\x9d coughs Mrs Miff whose cough is drier than the hay\r\nin any hassock in her charge, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to us one of these mornings,\r\nmy dears, unless I\xe2\x80\x99m much mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are looking at a tablet on the wall, erected to the memory of\r\nsomeone dead. They are a long way off from Mrs Miff, but Mrs Miff can\r\nsee with half an eye how she is leaning on his arm, and how his head is\r\nbent down over her. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Miff, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might do worse.\r\nFor you\xe2\x80\x99re a tidy pair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is nothing personal in Mrs Miff\xe2\x80\x99s remark. She merely speaks of\r\nstock-in-trade. She is hardly more curious in couples than in coffins.\r\nShe is such a spare, straight, dry old lady\xe2\x80\x94such a pew of a woman\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou should find as many individual sympathies in a chip. Mr Sownds,\r\nnow, who is fleshy, and has scarlet in his coat, is of a different\r\ntemperament. He says, as they stand upon the steps watching the young\r\ncouple away, that she has a pretty figure, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she, and as well as\r\nhe could see (for she held her head down coming out), an uncommon\r\npretty face. \xe2\x80\x9cAltogether, Mrs Miff,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Sownds with a relish, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\nis what you may call a rose-bud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Miff assents with a spare nod of her mortified bonnet; but approves\r\nof this so little, that she inwardly resolves she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the wife\r\nof Mr Sownds for any money he could give her, Beadle as he is.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the young couple saying as they leave the church, and go\r\nout at the gate?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Walter, thank you! I can go away, now, happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we come back, Florence, we will come and see his grave\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence lifts her eyes, so bright with tears, to his kind face; and\r\nclasps her disengaged hand on that other modest little hand which\r\nclasps his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very early, Walter, and the streets are almost empty yet. Let us\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will be so tired, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! I was very tired the first time that we ever walked together,\r\nbut I shall not be so today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thus\xe2\x80\x94not much changed\xe2\x80\x94she, as innocent and earnest-hearted\xe2\x80\x94he, as\r\nfrank, as hopeful, and more proud of her\xe2\x80\x94Florence and Walter, on their\r\nbridal morning, walk through the streets together.\r\n\r\nNot even in that childish walk of long ago, were they so far removed\r\nfrom all the world about them as today. The childish feet of long ago,\r\ndid not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now. The confidence\r\nand love of children may be given many times, and will spring up in\r\nmany places; but the woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart of Florence, with its undivided\r\ntreasure, can be yielded only once, and under slight or change, can\r\nonly droop and die.\r\n\r\nThey take the streets that are the quietest, and do not go near that in\r\nwhich her old home stands. It is a fair, warm summer morning, and the\r\nsun shines on them, as they walk towards the darkening mist that\r\noverspreads the City. Riches are uncovering in shops; jewels, gold, and\r\nsilver flash in the goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s sunny windows; and great houses cast a\r\nstately shade upon them as they pass. But through the light, and\r\nthrough the shade, they go on lovingly together, lost to everything\r\naround; thinking of no other riches, and no prouder home, than they\r\nhave now in one another.\r\n\r\nGradually they come into the darker, narrower streets, where the sun,\r\nnow yellow, and now red, is seen through the mist, only at street\r\ncorners, and in small open spaces where there is a tree, or one of the\r\ninnumerable churches, or a paved way and a flight of steps, or a\r\ncurious little patch of garden, or a burying-ground, where the few\r\ntombs and tombstones are almost black. Lovingly and trustfully, through\r\nall the narrow yards and alleys and the shady streets, Florence goes,\r\nclinging to his arm, to be his wife.\r\n\r\nHer heart beats quicker now, for Walter tells her that their church is\r\nvery near. They pass a few great stacks of warehouses, with waggons at\r\nthe doors, and busy carmen stopping up the way\xe2\x80\x94but Florence does not\r\nsee or hear them\xe2\x80\x94and then the air is quiet, and the day is darkened,\r\nand she is trembling in a church which has a strange smell like a\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\nThe shabby little old man, ringer of the disappointed bell, is standing\r\nin the porch, and has put his hat in the font\xe2\x80\x94for he is quite at home\r\nthere, being sexton. He ushers them into an old brown, panelled, dusty\r\nvestry, like a corner-cupboard with the shelves taken out; where the\r\nwormy registers diffuse a smell like faded snuff, which has set the\r\ntearful Nipper sneezing.\r\n\r\nYouthful, and how beautiful, the young bride looks, in this old dusty\r\nplace, with no kindred object near her but her husband. There is a\r\ndusty old clerk, who keeps a sort of evaporated news shop underneath an\r\narchway opposite, behind a perfect fortification of posts. There is a\r\ndusty old pew-opener who only keeps herself, and finds that quite\r\nenough to do. There is a dusty old beadle (these are Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s beadle\r\nand pew-opener of last Sunday), who has something to do with a\r\nWorshipful Company who have got a Hall in the next yard, with a\r\nstained-glass window in it that no mortal ever saw. There are dusty\r\nwooden ledges and cornices poked in and out over the altar, and over\r\nthe screen and round the gallery, and over the inscription about what\r\nthe Master and Wardens of the Worshipful Company did in one thousand\r\nsix hundred and ninety-four. There are dusty old sounding-boards over\r\nthe pulpit and reading-desk, looking like lids to be let down on the\r\nofficiating ministers in case of their giving offence. There is every\r\npossible provision for the accommodation of dust, except in the\r\nchurchyard, where the facilities in that respect are very limited.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, Uncle Sol, and Mr Toots are come; the clergyman is putting\r\non his surplice in the vestry, while the clerk walks round him, blowing\r\nthe dust off it; and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar.\r\nThere is no bridesmaid, unless Susan Nipper is one; and no better\r\nfather than Captain Cuttle. A man with a wooden leg, chewing a faint\r\napple and carrying a blue bag in has hand, looks in to see what is\r\ngoing on; but finding it nothing entertaining, stumps off again, and\r\npegs his way among the echoes out of doors.\r\n\r\nNo gracious ray of light is seen to fall on Florence, kneeling at the\r\naltar with her timid head bowed down. The morning luminary is built\r\nout, and don\xe2\x80\x99t shine there. There is a meagre tree outside, where the\r\nsparrows are chirping a little; and there is a blackbird in an\r\neyelet-hole of sun in a dyer\xe2\x80\x99s garret, over against the window, who\r\nwhistles loudly whilst the service is performing; and there is the man\r\nwith the wooden leg stumping away. The amens of the dusty clerk appear,\r\nlike Macbeth\xe2\x80\x99s, to stick in his throat a little; but Captain Cuttle\r\nhelps him out, and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates\r\nthree entirely new responses of that word, never introduced into the\r\nservice before.\r\n\r\nThey are married, and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy\r\nregisters, and the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s surplice is restored to the dust, and\r\nthe clergyman is gone home. In a dark corner of the dark church,\r\nFlorence has turned to Susan Nipper, and is weeping in her arms. Mr\r\nToots\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are red. The Captain lubricates his nose. Uncle Sol has\r\npulled down his spectacles from his forehead, and walked out to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Susan; dearest Susan! If you ever can bear witness to\r\nthe love I have for Walter, and the reason that I have to love him, do\r\nit for his sake. Good-bye! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey have thought it better not to go back to the Midshipman, but to\r\npart so; a coach is waiting for them, near at hand.\r\n\r\nMiss Nipper cannot speak; she only sobs and chokes, and hugs her\r\nmistress. Mr Toots advances, urges her to cheer up, and takes charge of\r\nher. Florence gives him her hand\xe2\x80\x94gives him, in the fulness of her\r\nheart, her lips\xe2\x80\x94kisses Uncle Sol, and Captain Cuttle, and is borne away\r\nby her young husband.\r\n\r\nBut Susan cannot bear that Florence should go away with a mournful\r\nrecollection of her. She had meant to be so different, that she\r\nreproaches herself bitterly. Intent on making one last effort to redeem\r\nher character, she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the\r\ncoach, and show a parting smile. The Captain, divining her object, sets\r\noff after her; for he feels it his duty also to dismiss them with a\r\ncheer, if possible. Uncle Sol and Mr Toots are left behind together,\r\noutside the church, to wait for them.\r\n\r\nThe coach is gone, but the street is steep, and narrow, and blocked up,\r\nand Susan can see it at a stand-still in the distance, she is sure.\r\nCaptain Cuttle follows her as she flies down the hill, and waves his\r\nglazed hat as a general signal, which may attract the right coach and\r\nwhich may not.\r\n\r\nSusan outstrips the Captain, and comes up with it. She looks in at the\r\nwindow, sees Walter, with the gentle face beside him, and claps her\r\nhands and screams:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Floy, my darling! look at me! We are all so happy now, dear! One\r\nmore good-bye, my precious, one more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow Susan does it, she don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but she reaches to the window,\r\nkisses her, and has her arms about her neck, in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all so\xe2\x80\x94so happy now, my dear Miss Floy!\xe2\x80\x9d says Susan, with a\r\nsuspicious catching in her breath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me\r\nnow. Now will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry, Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I am sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t. I say you won\xe2\x80\x99t, my pet, my dearest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaims Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cand here\xe2\x80\x99s the Captain too\xe2\x80\x94your friend the Captain,\r\nyou know\xe2\x80\x94to say good-bye once more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, my Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d vociferates the Captain, with a\r\ncountenance of strong emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr my lad. Hooroar!\r\nHooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat with the young husband at one window, and the young wife at the\r\nother; the Captain hanging on at this door, and Susan Nipper holding\r\nfast by that; the coach obliged to go on whether it will or no, and all\r\nthe other carts and coaches turbulent because it hesitates; there never\r\nwas so much confusion on four wheels. But Susan Nipper gallantly\r\nmaintains her point. She keeps a smiling face upon her mistress,\r\nsmiling through her tears, until the last. Even when she is left\r\nbehind, the Captain continues to appear and disappear at the door,\r\ncrying \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar, my lad! Hooroar, my Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Delight!\xe2\x80\x9d with his\r\nshirt-collar in a violent state of agitation, until it is hopeless to\r\nattempt to keep up with the coach any longer. Finally, when the coach\r\nis gone, Susan Nipper, being rejoined by the Captain, falls into a\r\nstate of insensibility, and is taken into a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop to recover.\r\n\r\nUncle Sol and Mr Toots wait patiently in the churchyard, sitting on the\r\ncoping-stone of the railings, until Captain Cuttle and Susan come back.\r\nNeither being at all desirous to speak, or to be spoken to, they are\r\nexcellent company, and quite satisfied. When they all arrive again at\r\nthe little Midshipman, and sit down to breakfast, nobody can touch a\r\nmorsel. Captain Cuttle makes a feint of being voracious about toast,\r\nbut gives it up as a swindle. Mr Toots says, after breakfast, he will\r\ncome back in the evening; and goes wandering about the town all day,\r\nwith a vague sensation upon him as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been to bed for a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange charm in the house, and in the room, in which they\r\nhave been used to be together, and out of which so much is gone. It\r\naggravates, and yet it soothes, the sorrow of the separation. Mr Toots\r\ntells Susan Nipper when he comes at night, that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been so\r\nwretched all day long, and yet he likes it. He confides in Susan\r\nNipper, being alone with her, and tells her what his feelings were when\r\nshe gave him that candid opinion as to the probability of Miss Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\never loving him. In the vein of confidence engendered by these common\r\nrecollections, and their tears, Mr Toots proposes that they shall go\r\nout together, and buy something for supper. Miss Nipper assenting, they\r\nbuy a good many little things; and, with the aid of Mrs Richards, set\r\nthe supper out quite showily before the Captain and old Sol came home.\r\n\r\nThe Captain and old Sol have been on board the ship, and have\r\nestablished Di there, and have seen the chests put aboard. They have\r\nmuch to tell about the popularity of Walter, and the comforts he will\r\nhave about him, and the quiet way in which it seems he has been working\r\nearly and late, to make his cabin what the Captain calls \xe2\x80\x9ca picter,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nsurprise his little wife. \xe2\x80\x9cA admiral\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, mind you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t more trim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut one of the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s chief delights is, that he knows the big\r\nwatch, and the sugar-tongs, and tea-spoons, are on board: and again and\r\nagain he murmurs to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cEd\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, my lad, you never shaped a\r\nbetter course in your life than when you made that there little\r\nproperty over jintly. You see how the land bore, Ed\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cand it does you credit, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old Instrument-maker is more distraught and misty than he used to\r\nbe, and takes the marriage and the parting very much to heart. But he\r\nis greatly comforted by having his old ally, Ned Cuttle, at his side;\r\nand he sits down to supper with a grateful and contented face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy has been preserved and thrives,\xe2\x80\x9d says old Sol Gills, rubbing\r\nhis hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have I to be otherwise than thankful and happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who has not yet taken his seat at the table, but who has\r\nbeen fidgeting about for some time, and now stands hesitating in his\r\nplace, looks doubtfully at Mr Gills, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSol! There\xe2\x80\x99s the last bottle of the old Madeira down below. Would you\r\nwish to have it up tonight, my boy, and drink to Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr and his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Instrument-maker, looking wistfully at the Captain, puts his hand\r\ninto the breast-pocket of his coffee-coloured coat, brings forth his\r\npocket-book, and takes a letter out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Walter. To be sent in three\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sir. I am married to your daughter. She is gone with me upon a\r\ndistant voyage. To be devoted to her is to have no claim on her or you,\r\nbut God knows that I am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why, loving her beyond all earthly things, I have yet, without\r\nremorse, united her to the uncertainties and dangers of my life, I will\r\nnot say to you. You know why, and you are her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do not reproach her. She has never reproached you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I do not think or hope that you will ever forgive me. There is\r\nnothing I expect less. But if an hour should come when it will comfort\r\nyou to believe that Florence has someone ever near her, the great\r\ncharge of whose life is to cancel her remembrance of past sorrow, I\r\nsolemnly assure you, you may, in that hour, rest in that belief.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon puts back the letter carefully in his pocket-book, and puts\r\nback his pocket-book in his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t drink the last bottle of the old Madeira yet, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nold man thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d assents the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan and Mr Toots are of the same opinion. After a silence they all\r\nsit down to supper, and drink to the young husband and wife in\r\nsomething else; and the last bottle of the old Madeira still remains\r\namong its dust and cobwebs, undisturbed.\r\n\r\nA few days have elapsed, and a stately ship is out at sea, spreading\r\nits white wings to the favouring wind.\r\n\r\nUpon the deck, image to the roughest man on board of something that is\r\ngraceful, beautiful, and harmless\xe2\x80\x94something that it is good and\r\npleasant to have there, and that should make the voyage prosperous\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nFlorence. It is night, and she and Walter sit alone, watching the\r\nsolemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon.\r\n\r\nAt length she cannot see it plainly, for the tears that fill her eyes;\r\nand then she lays her head down on his breast, and puts her arms around\r\nhis neck, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh Walter, dearest love, I am so happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband holds her to his heart, and they are very quiet, and the\r\nstately ship goes on serenely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I hear the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d says Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cand sit watching it, it brings so\r\nmany days into my mind. It makes me think so much\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Paul, my love. I know it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf Paul and Walter. And the voices in the waves are always whispering\r\nto Florence, in their ceaseless murmuring, of love\xe2\x80\x94of love, eternal and\r\nillimitable, not bounded by the confines of this world, or by the end\r\nof time, but ranging still, beyond the sea, beyond the sky, to the\r\ninvisible country far away!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nAfter a Lapse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea had ebbed and flowed, through a whole year. Through a whole\r\nyear, the winds and clouds had come and gone; the ceaseless work of\r\nTime had been performed, in storm and sunshine. Through a whole year,\r\nthe tides of human chance and change had set in their allotted courses.\r\nThrough a whole year, the famous House of Dombey and Son had fought a\r\nfight for life, against cross accidents, doubtful rumours, unsuccessful\r\nventures, unpropitious times, and most of all, against the infatuation\r\nof its head, who would not contract its enterprises by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreadth, and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he\r\nstrained so hard against the storm, was weak, and could not bear it.\r\n\r\nThe year was out, and the great House was down.\r\n\r\nOne summer afternoon; a year, wanting some odd days, after the marriage\r\nin the City church; there was a buzz and whisper upon \xe2\x80\x9cChange of a\r\ngreat failure. A certain cold proud man, well known there, was not\r\nthere, nor was he represented there. Next day it was noised abroad that\r\nDombey and Son had stopped, and next night there was a List of\r\nBankrupts published, headed by that name.\r\n\r\nThe world was very busy now, in sooth, and had a deal to say. It was an\r\ninnocently credulous and a much ill-used world. It was a world in which\r\nthere was no other sort of bankruptcy whatever. There were no\r\nconspicuous people in it, trading far and wide on rotten banks of\r\nreligion, patriotism, virtue, honour. There was no amount worth\r\nmentioning of mere paper in circulation, on which anybody lived pretty\r\nhandsomely, promising to pay great sums of goodness with no effects.\r\nThere were no shortcomings anywhere, in anything but money. The world\r\nwas very angry indeed; and the people especially, who, in a worse\r\nworld, might have been supposed to be apt traders themselves in shows\r\nand pretences, were observed to be mightily indignant.\r\n\r\nHere was a new inducement to dissipation, presented to that sport of\r\ncircumstances, Mr Perch the Messenger! It was apparently the fate of Mr\r\nPerch to be always waking up, and finding himself famous. He had but\r\nyesterday, as one might say, subsided into private life from the\r\ncelebrity of the elopement and the events that followed it; and now he\r\nwas made a more important man than ever, by the bankruptcy. Gliding\r\nfrom his bracket in the outer office where he now sat, watching the\r\nstrange faces of accountants and others, who quickly superseded nearly\r\nall the old clerks, Mr Perch had but to show himself in the court\r\noutside, or, at farthest, in the bar of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, to be asked a\r\nmultitude of questions, almost certain to include that interesting\r\nquestion, what would he take to drink? Then would Mr Perch descant upon\r\nthe hours of acute uneasiness he and Mrs Perch had suffered out at\r\nBalls Pond, when they first suspected \xe2\x80\x9cthings was going wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nwould Mr Perch relate to gaping listeners, in a low voice, as if the\r\ncorpse of the deceased House were lying unburied in the next room, how\r\nMrs Perch had first come to surmise that things was going wrong by\r\nhearing him (Perch) moaning in his sleep, \xe2\x80\x9ctwelve and ninepence in the\r\npound, twelve and ninepence in the pound!\xe2\x80\x9d Which act of somnambulism he\r\nsupposed to have originated in the impression made upon him by the\r\nchange in Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s face. Then would he inform them how he had once\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMight I make so bold as ask, Sir, are you unhappy in your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand how Mr Dombey had replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMy faithful Perch\xe2\x80\x94but no, it cannot\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x9d and with that had struck his hand upon his forehead, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me, Perch!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, in short, would Mr Perch, a victim to his\r\nposition, tell all manner of lies; affecting himself to tears by those\r\nthat were of a moving nature, and really believing that the inventions\r\nof yesterday had, on repetition, a sort of truth about them today.\r\n\r\nMr Perch always closed these conferences by meekly remarking, that, of\r\ncourse, whatever his suspicions might have been (as if he had ever had\r\nany!) it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for _him_ to betray his trust, was it? Which sentiment\r\n(there never being any creditors present) was received as doing great\r\nhonour to his feelings. Thus, he generally brought away a soothed\r\nconscience and left an agreeable impression behind him, when he\r\nreturned to his bracket: again to sit watching the strange faces of the\r\naccountants and others, making so free with the great mysteries, the\r\nBooks; or now and then to go on tiptoe into Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s empty room, and\r\nstir the fire; or to take an airing at the door, and have a little more\r\ndoleful chat with any straggler whom he knew; or to propitiate, with\r\nvarious small attentions, the head accountant: from whom Mr Perch had\r\nexpectations of a messengership in a Fire Office, when the affairs of\r\nthe House should be wound up.\r\n\r\nTo Major Bagstock, the bankruptcy was quite a calamity. The Major was\r\nnot a sympathetic character\xe2\x80\x94his attention being wholly concentrated on\r\nJ. B.\xe2\x80\x94nor was he a man subject to lively emotions, except in the\r\nphysical regards of gasping and choking. But he had so paraded his\r\nfriend Dombey at the club; had so flourished him at the heads of the\r\nmembers in general, and so put them down by continual assertion of his\r\nriches; that the club, being but human, was delighted to retort upon\r\nthe Major, by asking him, with a show of great concern, whether this\r\ntremendous smash had been at all expected, and how his friend Dombey\r\nbore it. To such questions, the Major, waxing very purple, would reply\r\nthat it was a bad world, Sir, altogether; that Joey knew a thing or\r\ntwo, but had been done, Sir, done like an infant; that if you had\r\nforetold this, Sir, to J. Bagstock, when he went abroad with Dombey and\r\nwas chasing that vagabond up and down France, J. Bagstock would have\r\npooh-pooh\xe2\x80\x99d you\xe2\x80\x94would have pooh-pooh\xe2\x80\x99d you, Sir, by the Lord! That Joe\r\nhad been deceived, Sir, taken in, hoodwinked, blindfolded, but was\r\nbroad awake again and staring; insomuch, Sir, that if Joe\xe2\x80\x99s father were\r\nto rise up from the grave to-morrow, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the old blade\r\nwith a penny piece, but would tell him that his son Josh was too old a\r\nsoldier to be done again, Sir. That he was a suspicious, crabbed,\r\ncranky, used-up, J. B. infidel, Sir; and that if it were consistent\r\nwith the dignity of a rough and tough old Major, of the old school, who\r\nhad had the honour of being personally known to, and commended by,\r\ntheir late Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and York, to retire to a\r\ntub and live in it, by Gad! Sir, he\xe2\x80\x99d have a tub in Pall Mall\r\nto-morrow, to show his contempt for mankind!\r\n\r\nOf all this, and many variations of the same tune, the Major would\r\ndeliver himself with so many apoplectic symptoms, such rollings of his\r\nhead, and such violent growls of ill usage and resentment, that the\r\nyounger members of the club surmised he had invested money in his\r\nfriend Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s House, and lost it; though the older soldiers and\r\ndeeper dogs, who knew Joe better, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of such a thing. The\r\nunfortunate Native, expressing no opinion, suffered dreadfully; not\r\nmerely in his moral feelings, which were regularly fusilladed by the\r\nMajor every hour in the day, and riddled through and through, but in\r\nhis sensitiveness to bodily knocks and bumps, which was kept\r\ncontinually on the stretch. For six entire weeks after the bankruptcy,\r\nthis miserable foreigner lived in a rainy season of boot-jacks and\r\nbrushes.\r\n\r\nMrs Chick had three ideas upon the subject of the terrible reverse. The\r\nfirst was that she could not understand it. The second, that her\r\nbrother had not made an effort. The third, that if she had been invited\r\nto dinner on the day of that first party, it never would have happened;\r\nand that she had said so, at the time.\r\n\r\nNobody\xe2\x80\x99s opinion stayed the misfortune, lightened it, or made it\r\nheavier. It was understood that the affairs of the House were to be\r\nwound up as they best could be; that Mr Dombey freely resigned\r\neverything he had, and asked for no favour from anyone. That any\r\nresumption of the business was out of the question, as he would listen\r\nto no friendly negotiation having that compromise in view; that he had\r\nrelinquished every post of trust or distinction he had held, as a man\r\nrespected among merchants; that he was dying, according to some; that\r\nhe was going melancholy mad, according to others; that he was a broken\r\nman, according to all.\r\n\r\nThe clerks dispersed after holding a little dinner of condolence among\r\nthemselves, which was enlivened by comic singing, and went off\r\nadmirably. Some took places abroad, and some engaged in other Houses at\r\nhome; some looked up relations in the country, for whom they suddenly\r\nremembered they had a particular affection; and some advertised for\r\nemployment in the newspapers. Mr Perch alone remained of all the late\r\nestablishment, sitting on his bracket looking at the accountants, or\r\nstarting off it, to propitiate the head accountant, who was to get him\r\ninto the Fire Office. The Counting House soon got to be dirty and\r\nneglected. The principal slipper and dogs\xe2\x80\x99 collar seller, at the corner\r\nof the court, would have doubted the propriety of throwing up his\r\nforefinger to the brim of his hat, any more, if Mr Dombey had appeared\r\nthere now; and the ticket porter, with his hands under his white apron,\r\nmoralised good sound morality about ambition, which (he observed) was\r\nnot, in his opinion, made to rhyme to perdition, for nothing.\r\n\r\nMr Morfin, the hazel-eyed bachelor, with the hair and whiskers\r\nsprinkled with grey, was perhaps the only person within the atmosphere\r\nof the House\xe2\x80\x94its head, of course, excepted\xe2\x80\x94who was heartily and deeply\r\naffected by the disaster that had befallen it. He had treated Mr Dombey\r\nwith due respect and deference through many years, but he had never\r\ndisguised his natural character, or meanly truckled to him, or pampered\r\nhis master passion for the advancement of his own purposes. He had,\r\ntherefore, no self-disrespect to avenge; no long-tightened springs to\r\nrelease with a quick recoil. He worked early and late to unravel\r\nwhatever was complicated or difficult in the records of the\r\ntransactions of the House; was always in attendance to explain whatever\r\nrequired explanation; sat in his old room sometimes very late at night,\r\nstudying points by his mastery of which he could spare Mr Dombey the\r\npain of being personally referred to; and then would go home to\r\nIslington, and calm his mind by producing the most dismal and forlorn\r\nsounds out of his violoncello before going to bed.\r\n\r\nHe was solacing himself with this melodious grumbler one evening, and,\r\nhaving been much dispirited by the proceedings of the day, was scraping\r\nconsolation out of its deepest notes, when his landlady (who was\r\nfortunately deaf, and had no other consciousness of these performances\r\nthan a sensation of something rumbling in her bones) announced a lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn mourning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe violoncello stopped immediately; and the performer, laying it on\r\nthe sofa with great tenderness and care, made a sign that the lady was\r\nto come in. He followed directly, and met Harriet Carker on the stair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand John here this morning! Is there anything the\r\nmatter, my dear? But no,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cyour face tells quite another\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it is a selfish revelation that you see there, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very pleasant one,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand, if selfish, a novelty too,\r\nworth seeing in you. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had placed a chair for her by this time, and sat down opposite; the\r\nvioloncello lying snugly on the sofa between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be surprised at my coming alone, or at John\xe2\x80\x99s not having\r\ntold you I was coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will believe that, when\r\nI tell you why I have come. May I do so now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do nothing better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not busy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the violoncello lying on the sofa, and said \xe2\x80\x9cI have been,\r\nall day. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my witness. I have been confiding all my cares to it. I\r\nwish I had none but my own to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the House at an end?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompletely at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it never be resumed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bright expression of her face was not overshadowed as her lips\r\nsilently repeated the word. He seemed to observe this with some little\r\ninvoluntary surprise: and said again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. You remember what I told you. It has been, all along,\r\nimpossible to convince him; impossible to reason with him; sometimes,\r\nimpossible even to approach him. The worst has happened; and the House\r\nhas fallen, never to be built up any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr Dombey, is he personally ruined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he have no private fortune left? Nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA certain eagerness in her voice, and something that was almost joyful\r\nin her look, seemed to surprise him more and more; to disappoint him\r\ntoo, and jar discordantly against his own emotions. He drummed with the\r\nfingers of one hand on the table, looking wistfully at her, and shaking\r\nhis head, said, after a pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe extent of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s resources is not accurately within my\r\nknowledge; but though they are doubtless very large, his obligations\r\nare enormous. He is a gentleman of high honour and integrity. Any man\r\nin his position could, and many a man in his position would, have saved\r\nhimself, by making terms which would have very slightly, almost\r\ninsensibly, increased the losses of those who had had dealings with\r\nhim, and left him a remnant to live upon. But he is resolved on payment\r\nto the last farthing of his means. His own words are, that they will\r\nclear, or nearly clear, the House, and that no one can lose much. Ah,\r\nMiss Harriet, it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do,\r\nthat vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess! His pride\r\nshows well in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard him with little or no change in her expression, and with a\r\ndivided attention that showed her to be busy with something in her own\r\nmind. When he was silent, she asked him hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one sees him. When this crisis of his affairs renders it necessary\r\nfor him to come out of his house, he comes out for the occasion, and\r\nagain goes home, and shuts himself up, and will see no one. He has\r\nwritten me a letter, acknowledging our past connexion in higher terms\r\nthan it deserved, and parting from me. I am delicate of obtruding\r\nmyself upon him now, never having had much intercourse with him in\r\nbetter times; but I have tried to do so. I have written, gone there,\r\nentreated. Quite in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched her, as in the hope that she would testify some greater\r\nconcern than she had yet shown; and spoke gravely and feelingly, as if\r\nto impress her the more; but there was no change in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Miss Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a disappointed air, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\nnot to the purpose. You have not come here to hear this. Some other and\r\npleasanter theme is in your mind. Let it be in mine, too, and we shall\r\ntalk upon more equal terms. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is the same theme,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harriet, with frank and quick\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not likely that it should be? Is it not natural that\r\nJohn and I should have been thinking and speaking very much of late of\r\nthese great changes? Mr Dombey, whom he served so many years\xe2\x80\x94you know\r\nupon what terms\xe2\x80\x94reduced, as you describe; and we quite rich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood, true face, as that face of hers was, and pleasant as it had been\r\nto him, Mr Morfin, the hazel-eyed bachelor, since the first time he had\r\never looked upon it, it pleased him less at that moment, lighted with a\r\nray of exultation, than it had ever pleased him before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not remind you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, casting down her eyes upon her\r\nblack dress, \xe2\x80\x9cthrough what means our circumstances changed. You have\r\nnot forgotten that our brother James, upon that dreadful day, left no\r\nwill, no relations but ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe face was pleasanter to him now, though it was pale and melancholy,\r\nthan it had been a moment since. He seemed to breathe more cheerily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cour history, the history of both my brothers, in\r\nconnexion with the unfortunate, unhappy gentleman, of whom you have\r\nspoken so truly. You know how few our wants are\xe2\x80\x94John\xe2\x80\x99s and mine\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat little use we have for money, after the life we have led together\r\nfor so many years; and now that he is earning an income that is ample\r\nfor us, through your kindness. You are not unprepared to hear what\r\nfavour I have come to ask of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know. I was, a minute ago. Now, I think, I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my dead brother I say nothing. If the dead know what we do\xe2\x80\x94but you\r\nunderstand me. Of my living brother I could say much; but what need I\r\nsay more, than that this act of duty, in which I have come to ask your\r\nindispensable assistance, is his own, and that he cannot rest until it\r\nis performed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes again; and the light of exultation in her face\r\nbegan to appear beautiful, in the observant eyes that watched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be done very quietly and\r\nsecretly. Your experience and knowledge will point out a way of doing\r\nit. Mr Dombey may, perhaps, be led to believe that it is something\r\nsaved, unexpectedly, from the wreck of his fortunes; or that it is a\r\nvoluntary tribute to his honourable and upright character, from some of\r\nthose with whom he has had great dealings; or that it is some old lost\r\ndebt repaid. There must be many ways of doing it. I know you will\r\nchoose the best. The favour I have come to ask is, that you will do it\r\nfor us in your own kind, generous, considerate manner. That you will\r\nnever speak of it to John, whose chief happiness in this act of\r\nrestitution is to do it secretly, unknown, and unapproved of: that only\r\na very small part of the inheritance may be reserved to us, until Mr\r\nDombey shall have possessed the interest of the rest for the remainder\r\nof his life; that you will keep our secret, faithfully\xe2\x80\x94but that I am\r\nsure you will; and that, from this time, it may seldom be whispered,\r\neven between you and me, but may live in my thoughts only as a new\r\nreason for thankfulness to Heaven, and joy and pride in my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch a look of exultation there may be on Angels\xe2\x80\x99 faces when the one\r\nrepentant sinner enters Heaven, among ninety-nine just men. It was not\r\ndimmed or tarnished by the joyful tears that filled her eyes, but was\r\nthe brighter for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Morfin, after a silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI was not prepared\r\nfor this. Do I understand you that you wish to make your own part in\r\nthe inheritance available for your good purpose, as well as John\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we have shared everything together for so\r\nlong a time, and have had no care, hope, or purpose apart, could I bear\r\nto be excluded from my share in this? May I not urge a claim to be my\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s partner and companion to the last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid that I should dispute it!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may rely on your friendly help?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew we might!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be a worse man than,\xe2\x80\x94than I hope I am, or would willingly\r\nbelieve myself, if I could not give you that assurance from my heart\r\nand soul. You may, implicitly. Upon my honour, I will keep your secret.\r\nAnd if it should be found that Mr Dombey is so reduced as I fear he\r\nwill be, acting on a determination that there seem to be no means of\r\ninfluencing, I will assist you to accomplish the design, on which you\r\nand John are jointly resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, and thanked him with a cordial, happy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, detaining it in his. \xe2\x80\x9cTo speak to you of the worth\r\nof any sacrifice that you can make now\xe2\x80\x94above all, of any sacrifice of\r\nmere money\xe2\x80\x94would be idle and presumptuous. To put before you any appeal\r\nto reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it, would be, I\r\nfeel, not less so. I have no right to mar the great end of a great\r\nhistory, by any obtrusion of my own weak self. I have every right to\r\nbend my head before what you confide to me, satisfied that it comes\r\nfrom a higher and better source of inspiration than my poor worldly\r\nknowledge. I will say only this: I am your faithful steward; and I\r\nwould rather be so, and your chosen friend, than I would be anybody in\r\nthe world, except yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thanked him again, cordially, and wished him good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going home?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tonight. I am not going home now; I have a visit to make alone.\r\nWill you come to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come to-morrow. In the meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthink of this, and how we can best proceed. And perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll think of\r\nit, dear Harriet, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94think of me a little in connexion with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed her down to a coach she had in waiting at the door; and if\r\nhis landlady had not been deaf, she would have heard him muttering as\r\nhe went back upstairs, when the coach had driven off, that we were\r\ncreatures of habit, and it was a sorrowful habit to be an old bachelor.\r\n\r\nThe violoncello lying on the sofa between the two chairs, he took it\r\nup, without putting away the vacant chair, and sat droning on it, and\r\nslowly shaking his head at the vacant chair, for a long, long time. The\r\nexpression he communicated to the instrument at first, though\r\nmonstrously pathetic and bland, was nothing to the expression he\r\ncommunicated to his own face, and bestowed upon the empty chair: which\r\nwas so sincere, that he was obliged to have recourse to Captain\r\nCuttle\xe2\x80\x99s remedy more than once, and to rub his face with his sleeve. By\r\ndegrees, however, the violoncello, in unison with his own frame of\r\nmind, glided melodiously into the Harmonious Blacksmith, which he\r\nplayed over and over again, until his ruddy and serene face gleamed\r\nlike true metal on the anvil of a veritable blacksmith. In fine, the\r\nvioloncello and the empty chair were the companions of his bachelorhood\r\nuntil nearly midnight; and when he took his supper, the violoncello set\r\nup on end in the sofa corner, big with the latent harmony of a whole\r\nfoundry full of harmonious blacksmiths, seemed to ogle the empty chair\r\nout of its crooked eyes, with unutterable intelligence.\r\n\r\nWhen Harriet left the house, the driver of her hired coach, taking a\r\ncourse that was evidently no new one to him, went in and out by\r\nbye-ways, through that part of the suburbs, until he arrived at some\r\nopen ground, where there were a few quiet little old houses standing\r\namong gardens. At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped, and\r\nHarriet alighted.\r\n\r\nHer gentle ringing at the bell was responded to by a dolorous-looking\r\nwoman, of light complexion, with raised eyebrows, and head drooping on\r\none side, who curtseyed at sight of her, and conducted her across the\r\ngarden to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your patient, nurse, tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a poor way, Miss, I am afraid. Oh how she do remind me, sometimes,\r\nof my Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Betsey Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the woman of the light complexion,\r\nin a sort of doleful rapture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what respect?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss, in all respects,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that she\xe2\x80\x99s grown\r\nup, and Betsey Jane, when at death\xe2\x80\x99s door, was but a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have told me she recovered,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Harriet mildly; \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nthere is the more reason for hope, Mrs Wickam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Miss, hope is an excellent thing for such as has the spirits to\r\nbear it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own spirits is not\r\nequal to it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t owe it any grudge. I envys them that is so\r\nblest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should try to be more cheerful,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Wickam grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was so\r\ninclined, the loneliness of this situation\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my speaking so\r\nfree\xe2\x80\x94would put it out of my power, in four and twenty hours; but I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t at all. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not. The little spirits that I ever had, I was\r\nbereaved of at Brighton some few years ago, and I think I feel myself\r\nthe better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn truth, this was the very Mrs Wickam who had superseded Mrs Richards\r\nas the nurse of little Paul, and who considered herself to have gained\r\nthe loss in question, under the roof of the amiable Pipchin. The\r\nexcellent and thoughtful old system, hallowed by long prescription,\r\nwhich has usually picked out from the rest of mankind the most dreary\r\nand uncomfortable people that could possibly be laid hold of, to act as\r\ninstructors of youth, finger-posts to the virtues, matrons, monitors,\r\nattendants on sick beds, and the like, had established Mrs Wickam in\r\nvery good business as a nurse, and had led to her serious qualities\r\nbeing particularly commended by an admiring and numerous connexion.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam, with her eyebrows elevated, and her head on one side,\r\nlighted the way upstairs to a clean, neat chamber, opening on another\r\nchamber dimly lighted, where there was a bed. In the first room, an old\r\nwoman sat mechanically staring out at the open window, on the darkness.\r\nIn the second, stretched upon the bed, lay the shadow of a figure that\r\nhad spurned the wind and rain, one wintry night; hardly to be\r\nrecognised now, but by the long black hair that showed so very black\r\nagainst the colourless face, and all the white things about it.\r\n\r\nOh, the strong eyes, and the weak frame! The eyes that turned so\r\neagerly and brightly to the door when Harriet came in; the feeble head\r\nthat could not raise itself, and moved so slowly round upon its pillow!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice!\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s mild voice, \xe2\x80\x9cam I late tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always seem late, but are always early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet had sat down by the bedside now, and put her hand upon the thin\r\nhand lying there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam, standing at the foot of the bed, like a disconsolate\r\nspectre, most decidedly and forcibly shook her head to negative this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters very little!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, with a faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter or\r\nworse today, is but a day\xe2\x80\x99s difference\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam, as a serious character, expressed her approval with a\r\ngroan; and having made some cold dabs at the bottom of the bedclothes,\r\nas feeling for the patient\xe2\x80\x99s feet and expecting to find them stony;\r\nwent clinking among the medicine bottles on the table, as who should\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile we are here, let us repeat the mixture as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, whispering to her visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cevil courses, and\r\nremorse, travel, want, and weather, storm within, and storm without,\r\nhave worn my life away. It will not last much longer.\r\n\r\nShe drew the hand up as she spoke, and laid her face against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lie here, sometimes, thinking I should like to live until I had had\r\na little time to show you how grateful I could be! It is a weakness,\r\nand soon passes. Better for you as it is. Better for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow different her hold upon the hand, from what it had been when she\r\ntook it by the fireside on the bleak winter evening! Scorn, rage,\r\ndefiance, recklessness, look here! This is the end.\r\n\r\nMrs Wickam having clinked sufficiently among the bottles, now produced\r\nthe mixture. Mrs Wickam looked hard at her patient in the act of\r\ndrinking, screwed her mouth up tight, her eyebrows also, and shook her\r\nhead, expressing that tortures shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her say it was a hopeless\r\ncase. Mrs Wickam then sprinkled a little cooling-stuff about the room,\r\nwith the air of a female grave-digger, who was strewing ashes on ashes,\r\ndust on dust\xe2\x80\x94for she was a serious character\xe2\x80\x94and withdrew to partake of\r\ncertain funeral baked meats downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alice, \xe2\x80\x9csince I went to you and told you what I\r\nhad done, and when you were advised it was too late for anyone to\r\nfollow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a year and more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year and more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, thoughtfully intent upon her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonths upon months since you brought me here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought me here, by force of gentleness and kindness. Me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice,\r\nshrinking with her face behind her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cand made me human by woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooks and words, and angel\xe2\x80\x99s deeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet bending over her, composed and soothed her. By and bye, Alice\r\nlying as before, with the hand against her face, asked to have her\r\nmother called.\r\n\r\nHarriet called to her more than once, but the old woman was so absorbed\r\nlooking out at the open window on the darkness, that she did not hear.\r\nIt was not until Harriet went to her and touched her, that she rose up,\r\nand came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, taking the hand again, and fixing her lustrous\r\neyes lovingly upon her visitor, while she merely addressed a motion of\r\nher finger to the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9ctell her what you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, my deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alice, faintly and solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9ctonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman, whose wits appeared disorderly by alarm, remorse, or\r\ngrief, came creeping along the side of the bed, opposite to that on\r\nwhich Harriet sat; and kneeling down, so as to bring her withered face\r\nupon a level with the coverlet, and stretching out her hand, so as to\r\ntouch her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm, began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy handsome gal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeaven, what a cry was that, with which she stopped there, gazing at\r\nthe poor form lying on the bed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChanged, long ago, mother! Withered, long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, without\r\nlooking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t grieve for that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94My daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cmy gal who\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get better,\r\nand shame \xe2\x80\x99em all with her good looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice smiled mournfully at Harriet, and fondled her hand a little\r\ncloser, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get better, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old woman, menacing the\r\nvacant air with her shrivelled fist, \xe2\x80\x9cand who\xe2\x80\x99ll shame \xe2\x80\x99em all with her\r\ngood looks\xe2\x80\x94she will. I say she will! she shall!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as if she were in\r\npassionate contention with some unseen opponent at the bedside, who\r\ncontradicted her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy daughter has been turned away from, and cast out,\r\nbut she could boast relationship to proud folks too, if she chose. Ah!\r\nTo proud folks! There\xe2\x80\x99s relationship without your clergy and your\r\nwedding rings\xe2\x80\x94they may make it, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t break it\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s well related. Show me Mrs Dombey, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you my\r\nAlice\xe2\x80\x99s first cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet glanced from the old woman to the lustrous eyes intent upon her\r\nface, and derived corroboration from them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, her nodding head bridling with a ghastly\r\nvanity. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I am old and ugly now,\xe2\x80\x94much older by life and habit\r\nthan years though,\xe2\x80\x94I was once as young as any. Ah! as pretty too, as\r\nmany! I was a fresh country wench in my time, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d stretching out\r\nher arm to Harriet, across the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cand looked it, too. Down in my\r\ncountry, Mrs Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s father and his brother were the gayest gentlemen\r\nand the best-liked that came a visiting from London\xe2\x80\x94they have long been\r\ndead, though! Lord, Lord, this long while! The brother, who was my\r\nAlly\xe2\x80\x99s father, longest of the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her head a little, and peered at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face; as if\r\nfrom the remembrance of her own youth, she had flown to the remembrance\r\nof her child\xe2\x80\x99s. Then, suddenly, she laid her face down on the bed, and\r\nshut her head up in her hands and arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were as like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, without looking up, as you\r\ncould see two brothers, so near an age\xe2\x80\x94there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much more than a\r\nyear between them, as I recollect\xe2\x80\x94and if you could have seen my gal, as\r\nI have seen her once, side by side with the other\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave seen, for all the difference of dress and life, that they were\r\nlike each other. Oh! is the likeness gone, and is it my gal\xe2\x80\x94only my\r\ngal\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s to change so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall all change, mother, in our turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut why not hers as soon as my gal\xe2\x80\x99s! The\r\nmother must have changed\xe2\x80\x94she looked as old as me, and full as wrinkled\r\nthrough her paint\xe2\x80\x94but she was handsome. What have I done, I, what have\r\nI done worse than her, that only my gal is to lie there fading!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith another of those wild cries, she went running out into the room\r\nfrom which she had come; but immediately, in her uncertain mood,\r\nreturned, and creeping up to Harriet, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Alice bade me tell you, deary. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. I found it out\r\nwhen I began to ask who she was, and all about her, away in\r\nWarwickshire there, one summer-time. Such relations was no good to me,\r\nthen. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have owned me, and had nothing to give me. I should\r\nhave asked \xe2\x80\x99em, maybe, for a little money, afterwards, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for my Alice; she\xe2\x80\x99d a\xe2\x80\x99most have killed me, if I had, I think. She\r\nwas as proud as t\xe2\x80\x99other in her way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, touching the\r\nface of her daughter fearfully, and withdrawing her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s so quiet now; but she\xe2\x80\x99ll shame \xe2\x80\x99em with her good looks yet. Ha,\r\nha! She\xe2\x80\x99ll shame \xe2\x80\x99em, will my handsome daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer laugh, as she retreated, was worse than her cry; worse than the\r\nburst of imbecile lamentation in which it ended; worse than the doting\r\nair with which she sat down in her old seat, and stared out at the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Alice had all this time been fixed on Harriet, whose hand\r\nshe had never released. She said now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have felt, lying here, that I should like you to know this. It might\r\nexplain, I have thought, something that used to help to harden me. I\r\nhad heard so much, in my wrongdoing, of my neglected duty, that I took\r\nup with the belief that duty had not been done to me, and that as the\r\nseed was sown, the harvest grew. I somehow made it out that when ladies\r\nhad bad homes and mothers, they went wrong in their way, too; but that\r\ntheir way was not so foul a one as mine, and they had need to bless God\r\nfor it. That is all past. It is like a dream, now, which I cannot quite\r\nremember or understand. It has been more and more like a dream, every\r\nday, since you began to sit here, and to read to me. I only tell it\r\nyou, as I can recollect it. Will you read to me a little more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was withdrawing her hand to open the book, when Alice detained\r\nit for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not forget my mother? I forgive her, if I have any cause. I\r\nknow that she forgives me, and is sorry in her heart. You will not\r\nforget her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Alice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment yet. Lay your head so, dear, that as you read I may see the\r\nwords in your kind face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet complied and read\xe2\x80\x94read the eternal book for all the weary, and\r\nthe heavy-laden; for all the wretched, fallen, and neglected of this\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94read the blessed history, in which the blind lame palsied beggar,\r\nthe criminal, the woman stained with shame, the shunned of all our\r\ndainty clay, has each a portion, that no human pride, indifference, or\r\nsophistry, through all the ages that this world shall last, can take\r\naway, or by the thousandth atom of a grain reduce\xe2\x80\x94read the ministry of\r\nHim who, through the round of human life, and all its hopes and griefs,\r\nfrom birth to death, from infancy to age, had sweet compassion for, and\r\ninterest in, its every scene and stage, its every suffering and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, when she shut the book, \xe2\x80\x9cvery early in\r\nthe morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lustrous eyes, yet fixed upon her face, closed for a moment, then\r\nopened; and Alice kissed and blest her.\r\n\r\nThe same eyes followed her to the door; and in their light, and on the\r\ntranquil face, there was a smile when it was closed.\r\n\r\nThey never turned away. She laid her hand upon her breast, murmuring\r\nthe sacred name that had been read to her; and life passed from her\r\nface, like light removed.\r\n\r\nNothing lay there, any longer, but the ruin of the mortal house on\r\nwhich the rain had beaten, and the black hair that had fluttered in the\r\nwintry wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nRetribution\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges have come again upon the great house in the long dull street,\r\nonce the scene of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s childhood and loneliness. It is a great\r\nhouse still, proof against wind and weather, without breaches in the\r\nroof, or shattered windows, or dilapidated walls; but it is a ruin none\r\nthe less, and the rats fly from it.\r\n\r\nMr Towlinson and company are, at first, incredulous in respect of the\r\nshapeless rumours that they hear. Cook says our people\xe2\x80\x99s credit ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso easy shook as that comes to, thank God; and Mr Towlinson expects to\r\nhear it reported next, that the Bank of England\xe2\x80\x99s a-going to break, or\r\nthe jewels in the Tower to be sold up. But, next come the Gazette, and\r\nMr Perch; and Mr Perch brings Mrs Perch to talk it over in the kitchen,\r\nand to spend a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there is no doubt about it, Mr Towlinson\xe2\x80\x99s main anxiety is\r\nthat the failure should be a good round one\xe2\x80\x94not less than a hundred\r\nthousand pound. Mr Perch don\xe2\x80\x99t think himself that a hundred thousand\r\npound will nearly cover it. The women, led by Mrs Perch and Cook, often\r\nrepeat \xe2\x80\x9ca hun-dred thou-sand pound!\xe2\x80\x9d with awful satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94as if\r\nhandling the words were like handling the money; and the housemaid, who\r\nhas her eye on Mr Towlinson, wishes she had only a hundredth part of\r\nthe sum to bestow on the man of her choice. Mr Towlinson, still mindful\r\nof his old wrong, opines that a foreigner would hardly know what to do\r\nwith so much money, unless he spent it on his whiskers; which bitter\r\nsarcasm causes the housemaid to withdraw in tears.\r\n\r\nBut not to remain long absent; for Cook, who has the reputation of\r\nbeing extremely good-hearted, says, whatever they do, let \xe2\x80\x99em stand by\r\none another now, Towlinson, for there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling how soon they may be\r\ndivided. They have been in that house (says Cook) through a funeral, a\r\nwedding, and a running-away; and let it not be said that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nagree among themselves at such a time as the present. Mrs Perch is\r\nimmensely affected by this moving address, and openly remarks that Cook\r\nis an angel. Mr Towlinson replies to Cook, far be it from him to stand\r\nin the way of that good feeling which he could wish to see; and\r\nadjourning in quest of the housemaid, and presently returning with that\r\nyoung lady on his arm, informs the kitchen that foreigners is only his\r\nfun, and that him and Anne have now resolved to take one another for\r\nbetter for worse, and to settle in Oxford Market in the general\r\ngreengrocery and herb and leech line, where your kind favours is\r\nparticular requested. This announcement is received with acclamation;\r\nand Mrs Perch, projecting her soul into futurity, says, \xe2\x80\x9cgirls,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nCook\xe2\x80\x99s ear, in a solemn whisper.\r\n\r\nMisfortune in the family without feasting, in these lower regions,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. Therefore Cook tosses up a hot dish or two for supper, and\r\nMr Towlinson compounds a lobster salad to be devoted to the same\r\nhospitable purpose. Even Mrs Pipchin, agitated by the occasion, rings\r\nher bell, and sends down word that she requests to have that little bit\r\nof sweetbread that was left, warmed up for her supper, and sent to her\r\non a tray with about a quarter of a tumbler-full of mulled sherry; for\r\nshe feels poorly.\r\n\r\nThere is a little talk about Mr Dombey, but very little. It is chiefly\r\nspeculation as to how long he has known that this was going to happen.\r\nCook says shrewdly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh a long time, bless you! Take your oath of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d And reference being made to Mr Perch, he confirms her view of\r\nthe case. Somebody wonders what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do, and whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll go out in\r\nany situation. Mr Towlinson thinks not, and hints at a refuge in one of\r\nthem genteel almshouses of the better kind. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll have his\r\nlittle garden, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cook plaintively, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring up sweet\r\npeas in the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Towlinson, \xe2\x80\x9cand be one of\r\nthe Brethren of something or another.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs\r\nPerch, in a pause of her drink. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept the sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Perch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are the mighty fallen!\xe2\x80\x9d remarks Cook. \xe2\x80\x9cPride shall have a fall,\r\nand it always was and will be so!\xe2\x80\x9d observes the housemaid.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how good they feel, in making these reflections; and\r\nwhat a Christian unanimity they are sensible of, in bearing the common\r\nshock with resignation. There is only one interruption to this\r\nexcellent state of mind, which is occasioned by a young kitchen-maid of\r\ninferior rank\xe2\x80\x94in black stockings\xe2\x80\x94who, having sat with her mouth open\r\nfor a long time, unexpectedly discharges from it words to this effect,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose the wages shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paid!\xe2\x80\x9d The company sit for a moment\r\nspeechless; but Cook recovering first, turns upon the young woman, and\r\nrequests to know how she dares insult the family, whose bread she eats,\r\nby such a dishonest supposition, and whether she thinks that anybody,\r\nwith a scrap of honour left, could deprive poor servants of their\r\npittance? \xe2\x80\x9cBecause if that is your religious feelings, Mary Daws,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nCook warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you mean to go to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Towlinson don\xe2\x80\x99t know either; nor anybody; and the young\r\nkitchen-maid, appearing not to know exactly, herself, and scouted by\r\nthe general voice, is covered with confusion, as with a garment.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, strange people begin to call at the house, and to\r\nmake appointments with one another in the dining-room, as if they lived\r\nthere. Especially, there is a gentleman, of a Mosaic Arabian cast of\r\ncountenance, with a very massive watch-guard, who whistles in the\r\ndrawing-room, and, while he is waiting for the other gentleman, who\r\nalways has pen and ink in his pocket, asks Mr Towlinson (by the easy\r\nname of \xe2\x80\x9cOld Cock,\xe2\x80\x9d) if he happens to know what the figure of them\r\ncrimson and gold hangings might have been, when new bought. The callers\r\nand appointments in the dining-room become more numerous every day, and\r\nevery gentleman seems to have pen and ink in his pocket, and to have\r\nsome occasion to use it. At last it is said that there is going to be a\r\nSale; and then more people arrive, with pen and ink in their pockets,\r\ncommanding a detachment of men with carpet caps, who immediately begin\r\nto pull up the carpets, and knock the furniture about, and to print off\r\nthousands of impressions of their shoes upon the hall and staircase.\r\n\r\nThe council downstairs are in full conclave all this time, and, having\r\nnothing to do, perform perfect feats of eating. At length, they are one\r\nday summoned in a body to Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s room, and thus addressed by the\r\nfair Peruvian:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour master\xe2\x80\x99s in difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin, tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nthat, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Towlinson, as spokesman, admits a general knowledge of the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re all on the look-out for yourselves, I warrant you,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMrs Pipchin, shaking her head at them.\r\n\r\nA shrill voice from the rear exclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cNo more than yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion, Mrs Impudence, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d says the ireful Pipchin,\r\nlooking with a fiery eye over the intermediate heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs Pipchin, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replies Cook, advancing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then,\r\npray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then you may go as soon as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nsooner the better; and I hope I shall never see your face again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this the doughty Pipchin produces a canvas bag; and tells her\r\nwages out to that day, and a month beyond it; and clutches the money\r\ntight, until a receipt for the same is duly signed, to the last\r\nupstroke; when she grudgingly lets it go. This form of proceeding Mrs\r\nPipchin repeats with every member of the household, until all are paid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow those that choose, can go about their business,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand those that choose can stay here on board wages for a week or so,\r\nand make themselves useful. Except,\xe2\x80\x9d says the inflammable Pipchin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat slut of a cook, who\xe2\x80\x99ll go immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cook, \xe2\x80\x9cshe certainly will! I wish you good day, Mrs\r\nPipchin, and sincerely wish I could compliment you on the sweetness of\r\nyour appearance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along with you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin, stamping her foot.\r\n\r\nCook sails off with an air of beneficent dignity, highly exasperating\r\nto Mrs Pipchin, and is shortly joined below stairs by the rest of the\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nMr Towlinson then says that, in the first place, he would beg to\r\npropose a little snack of something to eat; and over that snack would\r\ndesire to offer a suggestion which he thinks will meet the position in\r\nwhich they find themselves. The refreshment being produced, and very\r\nheartily partaken of, Mr Towlinson\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion is, in effect, that\r\nCook is going, and that if we are not true to ourselves, nobody will be\r\ntrue to us. That they have lived in that house a long time, and exerted\r\nthemselves very much to be sociable together. (At this, Cook says, with\r\nemotion, \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs Perch, who is there again, and full to\r\nthe throat, sheds tears.) And that he thinks, at the present time, the\r\nfeeling ought to be \xe2\x80\x9cGo one, go all!\xe2\x80\x9d The housemaid is much affected by\r\nthis generous sentiment, and warmly seconds it. Cook says she feels\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s right, and only hopes it\xe2\x80\x99s not done as a compliment to her, but\r\nfrom a sense of duty. Mr Towlinson replies, from a sense of duty; and\r\nthat now he is driven to express his opinions, he will openly say, that\r\nhe does not think it over-respectable to remain in a house where Sales\r\nand such-like are carrying forwards. The housemaid is sure of it; and\r\nrelates, in confirmation, that a strange man, in a carpet cap, offered,\r\nthis very morning, to kiss her on the stairs. Hereupon, Mr Towlinson is\r\nstarting from his chair, to seek and \xe2\x80\x9csmash\xe2\x80\x9d the offender; when he is\r\nlaid hold on by the ladies, who beseech him to calm himself, and to\r\nreflect that it is easier and wiser to leave the scene of such\r\nindecencies at once. Mrs Perch, presenting the case in a new light,\r\neven shows that delicacy towards Mr Dombey, shut up in his own rooms,\r\nimperatively demands precipitate retreat. \xe2\x80\x9cFor what,\xe2\x80\x9d says the good\r\nwoman, \xe2\x80\x9cmust his feelings be, if he was to come upon any of the poor\r\nservants that he once deceived into thinking him immensely rich!\xe2\x80\x9d Cook\r\nis so struck by this moral consideration, that Mrs Perch improves it\r\nwith several pious axioms, original and selected. It becomes a clear\r\ncase that they must all go. Boxes are packed, cabs fetched, and at dusk\r\nthat evening there is not one member of the party left.\r\n\r\nThe house stands, large and weather-proof, in the long dull street; but\r\nit is a ruin, and the rats fly from it.\r\n\r\nThe men in the carpet caps go on tumbling the furniture about; and the\r\ngentlemen with the pens and ink make out inventories of it, and sit\r\nupon pieces of furniture never made to be sat upon, and eat bread and\r\ncheese from the public-house on other pieces of furniture never made to\r\nbe eaten on, and seem to have a delight in appropriating precious\r\narticles to strange uses. Chaotic combinations of furniture also take\r\nplace. Mattresses and bedding appear in the dining-room; the glass and\r\nchina get into the conservatory; the great dinner service is set out in\r\nheaps on the long divan in the large drawing-room; and the stair-wires,\r\nmade into fasces, decorate the marble chimneypieces. Finally, a rug,\r\nwith a printed bill upon it, is hung out from the balcony; and a\r\nsimilar appendage graces either side of the hall door.\r\n\r\nThen, all day long, there is a retinue of mouldy gigs and chaise-carts\r\nin the street; and herds of shabby vampires, Jew and Christian,\r\nover-run the house, sounding the plate-glass mirrors with their\r\nknuckles, striking discordant octaves on the Grand Piano, drawing wet\r\nforefingers over the pictures, breathing on the blades of the best\r\ndinner-knives, punching the squabs of chairs and sofas with their dirty\r\nfists, touzling the feather beds, opening and shutting all the drawers,\r\nbalancing the silver spoons and forks, looking into the very threads of\r\nthe drapery and linen, and disparaging everything. There is not a\r\nsecret place in the whole house. Fluffy and snuffy strangers stare into\r\nthe kitchen-range as curiously as into the attic clothes-press. Stout\r\nmen with napless hats on, look out of the bedroom windows, and cut\r\njokes with friends in the street. Quiet, calculating spirits withdraw\r\ninto the dressing-rooms with catalogues, and make marginal notes\r\nthereon, with stumps of pencils. Two brokers invade the very\r\nfire-escape, and take a panoramic survey of the neighbourhood from the\r\ntop of the house. The swarm and buzz, and going up and down, endure for\r\ndays. The Capital Modern Household Furniture, &c., is on view.\r\n\r\nThen there is a palisade of tables made in the best drawing-room; and\r\non the capital, french-polished, extending, telescopic range of Spanish\r\nmahogany dining-tables with turned legs, the pulpit of the Auctioneer\r\nis erected; and the herds of shabby vampires, Jew and Christian, the\r\nstrangers fluffy and snuffy, and the stout men with the napless hats,\r\ncongregate about it and sit upon everything within reach, mantel-pieces\r\nincluded, and begin to bid. Hot, humming, and dusty are the rooms all\r\nday; and\xe2\x80\x94high above the heat, hum, and dust\xe2\x80\x94the head and shoulders,\r\nvoice and hammer, of the Auctioneer, are ever at work. The men in the\r\ncarpet caps get flustered and vicious with tumbling the Lots about, and\r\nstill the Lots are going, going, gone; still coming on. Sometimes there\r\nis joking and a general roar. This lasts all day and three days\r\nfollowing. The Capital Modern Household Furniture, &c., is on sale.\r\n\r\nThen the mouldy gigs and chaise-carts reappear; and with them come\r\nspring-vans and waggons, and an army of porters with knots. All day\r\nlong, the men with carpet caps are screwing at screw-drivers and\r\nbed-winches, or staggering by the dozen together on the staircase under\r\nheavy burdens, or upheaving perfect rocks of Spanish mahogany, best\r\nrose-wood, or plate-glass, into the gigs and chaise-carts, vans and\r\nwaggons. All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance, from a\r\ntilted waggon to a wheelbarrow. Poor Paul\xe2\x80\x99s little bedstead is carried\r\noff in a donkey-tandem. For nearly a whole week, the Capital Modern\r\nHousehold Furniture, & c., is in course of removal.\r\n\r\nAt last it is all gone. Nothing is left about the house but scattered\r\nleaves of catalogues, littered scraps of straw and hay, and a battery\r\nof pewter pots behind the hall-door. The men with the carpet-caps\r\ngather up their screw-drivers and bed-winches into bags, shoulder them,\r\nand walk off. One of the pen-and-ink gentlemen goes over the house as a\r\nlast attention; sticking up bills in the windows respecting the lease\r\nof this desirable family mansion, and shutting the shutters. At length\r\nhe follows the men with the carpet caps. None of the invaders remain.\r\nThe house is a ruin, and the rats fly from it.\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, together with those locked rooms on the\r\nground-floor where the window-blinds are drawn down close, have been\r\nspared the general devastation. Mrs Pipchin has remained austere and\r\nstony during the proceedings, in her own room; or has occasionally\r\nlooked in at the sale to see what the goods are fetching, and to bid\r\nfor one particular easy chair. Mrs Pipchin has been the highest bidder\r\nfor the easy chair, and sits upon her property when Mrs Chick comes to\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is my brother, Mrs Pipchin?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any more than the deuce,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never\r\ndoes me the honour to speak to me. He has his meat and drink put in the\r\nnext room to his own; and what he takes, he comes out and takes when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody there. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use asking me. I know no more about him\r\nthan the man in the south who burnt his mouth by eating cold plum\r\nporridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis the acrimonious Pipchin says with a flounce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut good gracious me!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs Chick blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long is this to\r\nlast! If my brother will not make an effort, Mrs Pipchin, what is to\r\nbecome of him? I am sure I should have thought he had seen enough of\r\nthe consequences of not making an effort, by this time, to be warned\r\nagainst that fatal error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoity toity!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin, rubbing her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nfuss, I think, about it. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t so wonderful a case. People have had\r\nmisfortunes before now, and been obliged to part with their furniture.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother,\xe2\x80\x9d pursues Mrs Chick profoundly, \xe2\x80\x9cis so peculiar\xe2\x80\x94so strange\r\na man. He is the most peculiar man I ever saw. Would anyone believe\r\nthat when he received news of the marriage and emigration of that\r\nunnatural child\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to me, now, to remember that I always\r\nsaid there was something extraordinary about that child: but nobody\r\nminds me\xe2\x80\x94would anybody believe, I say, that he should then turn round\r\nupon me and say he had supposed, from my manner, that she had come to\r\nmy house? Why, my gracious! And would anybody believe that when I\r\nmerely say to him, \xe2\x80\x98Paul, I may be very foolish, and I have no doubt I\r\nam, but I cannot understand how your affairs can have got into this\r\nstate,\xe2\x80\x99 he should actually fly at me, and request that I will come to\r\nsee him no more until he asks me! Why, my goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a little more to do with\r\nmines. They\xe2\x80\x99d have tried his temper for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d resumes Mrs Chick, quite regardless of Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservations, \xe2\x80\x9cis it to end in? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. What does\r\nmy brother mean to do? He must do something. It\xe2\x80\x99s of no use remaining\r\nshut up in his own rooms. Business won\xe2\x80\x99t come to him. No. He must go to\r\nit. Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t he go? He knows where to go, I suppose, having been\r\na man of business all his life. Very good. Then why not go there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Chick, after forging this powerful chain of reasoning, remains\r\nsilent for a minute to admire it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d says the discreet lady, with an argumentative air, \xe2\x80\x9cwho ever\r\nheard of such obstinacy as his staying shut up here through all these\r\ndreadful disagreeables? It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there was no place for him to go\r\nto. Of course he could have come to our house. He knows he is at home\r\nthere, I suppose? Mr Chick has perfectly bored about it, and I said\r\nwith my own lips, \xe2\x80\x98Why surely, Paul, you don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that because\r\nyour affairs have got into this state, you are the less at home to such\r\nnear relatives as ourselves? You don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that we are like the\r\nrest of the world?\xe2\x80\x99 But no; here he stays all through, and here he is.\r\nWhy, good gracious me, suppose the house was to be let! What would he\r\ndo then? He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remain here then. If he attempted to do so, there\r\nwould be an ejectment, an action for Doe, and all sorts of things; and\r\nthen he must go. Then why not go at first instead of at last? And that\r\nbrings me back to what I said just now, and I naturally ask what is to\r\nbe the end of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what\xe2\x80\x99s to be the end of it, as far as I am concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d replies\r\nMrs Pipchin, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take myself off in\r\na jiffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a which, Mrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Chick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a jiffy,\xe2\x80\x9d retorts Mrs Pipchin sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! really I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame you, Mrs Pipchin,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Chick, with\r\nfrankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be pretty much the same to me, if you could,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the\r\nsardonic Pipchin. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate I\xe2\x80\x99m going. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop here. I should\r\nbe dead in a week. I had to cook my own pork chop yesterday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot used to it. My constitution will be giving way next. Besides, I had\r\na very fair connexion at Brighton when I came here\xe2\x80\x94little Pankey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfolks alone were worth a good eighty pounds a-year to me\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to throw it away. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written to my niece, and she expects me\r\nby this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you spoken to my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d inquires Mrs Chick\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to say speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d retorts Mrs Pipchin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it done? I called out to him yesterday, that I was no use here,\r\nand that he had better let me send for Mrs Richards. He grunted\r\nsomething or other that meant yes, and I sent. Grunt indeed! If he had\r\nbeen Mr Pipchin, he\xe2\x80\x99d have had some reason to grunt. Yah! I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\npatience with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere this exemplary female, who has pumped up so much fortitude and\r\nvirtue from the depths of the Peruvian mines, rises from her cushioned\r\nproperty to see Mrs Chick to the door. Mrs Chick, deploring to the last\r\nthe peculiar character of her brother, noiselessly retires, much\r\noccupied with her own sagacity and clearness of head.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the evening Mr Toodle, being off duty, arrives with\r\nPolly and a box, and leaves them, with a sounding kiss, in the hall of\r\nthe empty house, the retired character of which affects Mr Toodle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits strongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, Polly, me dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toodle, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing now an\r\ningine-driver, and well to do in the world, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow of your\r\ncoming here, to be made dull-like, if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t for favours past. But\r\nfavours past, Polly, is never to be forgot. To them which is in\r\nadversity, besides, your face is a cord\xe2\x80\x99l. So let\xe2\x80\x99s have another kiss\r\non it, my dear. You wish no better than to do a right act, I know; and\r\nmy views is, that it\xe2\x80\x99s right and dutiful to do this. Good-night,\r\nPolly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pipchin by this time looms dark in her black bombazeen skirts,\r\nblack bonnet, and shawl; and has her personal property packed up; and\r\nhas her chair (late a favourite chair of Mr Dombey\xe2\x80\x99s and the dead\r\nbargain of the sale) ready near the street door; and is only waiting\r\nfor a fly-van, going tonight to Brighton on private service, which is\r\nto call for her, by private contract, and convey her home.\r\n\r\nPresently it comes. Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe being handed in and stowed\r\naway, Mrs Pipchin\xe2\x80\x99s chair is next handed in, and placed in a convenient\r\ncorner among certain trusses of hay; it being the intention of the\r\namiable woman to occupy the chair during her journey. Mrs Pipchin\r\nherself is next handed in, and grimly takes her seat. There is a snaky\r\ngleam in her hard grey eye, as of anticipated rounds of buttered toast,\r\nrelays of hot chops, worryings and quellings of young children, sharp\r\nsnappings at poor Berry, and all the other delights of her Ogress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncastle. Mrs Pipchin almost laughs as the fly-van drives off, and she\r\ncomposes her black bombazeen skirts, and settles herself among the\r\ncushions of her easy chair.\r\n\r\nThe house is such a ruin that the rats have fled, and there is not one\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nBut Polly, though alone in the deserted mansion\xe2\x80\x94for there is no\r\ncompanionship in the shut-up rooms in which its late master hides his\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94is not alone long. It is night; and she is sitting at work in the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, trying to forget what a lonely house it is, and\r\nwhat a history belongs to it; when there is a knock at the hall door,\r\nas loud sounding as any knock can be, striking into such an empty\r\nplace. Opening it, she returns across the echoing hall, accompanied by\r\na female figure in a close black bonnet. It is Miss Tox, and Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes are red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Polly,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I looked in to have a little lesson\r\nwith the children just now, I got the message that you left for me; and\r\nas soon as I could recover my spirits at all, I came on after you. Is\r\nthere no one here but you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! not a soul,\xe2\x80\x9d says Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d whispers Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you,\xe2\x80\x9d returns Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cno; he has not been seen this many a day.\r\nThey tell me he never leaves his room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he said to be ill?\xe2\x80\x9d inquires Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, not that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d returns Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in his mind. He\r\nmust be very bad there, poor gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy is such that she can scarcely speak. She is no\r\nchicken, but she has not grown tough with age and celibacy. Her heart\r\nis very tender, her compassion very genuine, her homage very real.\r\nBeneath the locket with the fishy eye in it, Miss Tox bears better\r\nqualities than many a less whimsical outside; such qualities as will\r\noutlive, by many courses of the sun, the best outsides and brightest\r\nhusks that fall in the harvest of the great reaper.\r\n\r\nIt is long before Miss Tox goes away, and before Polly, with a candle\r\nflaring on the blank stairs, looks after her, for company, down the\r\nstreet, and feels unwilling to go back into the dreary house, and jar\r\nits emptiness with the heavy fastenings of the door, and glide away to\r\nbed. But all this Polly does; and in the morning sets in one of those\r\ndarkened rooms such matters as she has been advised to prepare, and\r\nthen retires and enters them no more until next morning at the same\r\nhour. There are bells there, but they never ring; and though she can\r\nsometimes hear a footfall going to and fro, it never comes out.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox returns early in the day. It then begins to be Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noccupation to prepare little dainties\xe2\x80\x94or what are such to her\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\ncarried into these rooms next morning. She derives so much satisfaction\r\nfrom the pursuit, that she enters on it regularly from that time; and\r\nbrings daily in her little basket, various choice condiments selected\r\nfrom the scanty stores of the deceased owner of the powdered head and\r\npigtail. She likewise brings, in sheets of curl-paper, morsels of cold\r\nmeats, tongues of sheep, halves of fowls, for her own dinner; and\r\nsharing these collations with Polly, passes the greater part of her\r\ntime in the ruined house that the rats have fled from: hiding, in a\r\nfright at every sound, stealing in and out like a criminal; only\r\ndesiring to be true to the fallen object of her admiration, unknown to\r\nhim, unknown to all the world but one poor simple woman.\r\n\r\nThe Major knows it; but no one is the wiser for that, though the Major\r\nis much the merrier. The Major, in a fit of curiosity, has charged the\r\nNative to watch the house sometimes, and find out what becomes of\r\nDombey. The Native has reported Miss Tox\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity, and the Major has\r\nnearly choked himself dead with laughter. He is permanently bluer from\r\nthat hour, and constantly wheezes to himself, his lobster eyes starting\r\nout of his head, \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, Sir, the woman\xe2\x80\x99s a born idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the ruined man. How does he pass the hours, alone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him remember it in that room, years to come!\xe2\x80\x9d He did remember it.\r\nIt was heavy on his mind now; heavier than all the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him remember it in that room, years to come! The rain that falls\r\nupon the roof, the wind that mourns outside the door, may have\r\nforeknowledge in their melancholy sound. Let him remember it in that\r\nroom, years to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did remember it. In the miserable night he thought of it; in the\r\ndreary day, the wretched dawn, the ghostly, memory-haunted twilight. He\r\ndid remember it. In agony, in sorrow, in remorse, in despair! \xe2\x80\x9cPapa!\r\nPapa! Speak to me, dear Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d He heard the words again, and saw the\r\nface. He saw it fall upon the trembling hands, and heard the one\r\nprolonged low cry go upward.\r\n\r\nHe was fallen, never to be raised up any more. For the night of his\r\nworldly ruin there was no to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s sun; for the stain of his\r\ndomestic shame there was no purification; nothing, thank Heaven, could\r\nbring his dead child back to life. But that which he might have made so\r\ndifferent in all the Past\xe2\x80\x94which might have made the Past itself so\r\ndifferent, though this he hardly thought of now\xe2\x80\x94that which was his own\r\nwork, that which he could so easily have wrought into a blessing, and\r\nhad set himself so steadily for years to form into a curse: that was\r\nthe sharp grief of his soul.\r\n\r\nOh! He did remember it! The rain that fell upon the roof, the wind that\r\nmourned outside the door that night, had had foreknowledge in their\r\nmelancholy sound. He knew, now, what he had done. He knew, now, that he\r\nhad called down that upon his head, which bowed it lower than the\r\nheaviest stroke of fortune. He knew, now, what it was to be rejected\r\nand deserted; now, when every loving blossom he had withered in his\r\ninnocent daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart was snowing down in ashes on him.\r\n\r\nHe thought of her, as she had been that night when he and his bride\r\ncame home. He thought of her as she had been, in all the home-events of\r\nthe abandoned house. He thought, now, that of all around him, she alone\r\nhad never changed. His boy had faded into dust, his proud wife had sunk\r\ninto a polluted creature, his flatterer and friend had been transformed\r\ninto the worst of villains, his riches had melted away, the very walls\r\nthat sheltered him looked on him as a stranger; she alone had turned\r\nthe same mild gentle look upon him always. Yes, to the latest and the\r\nlast. She had never changed to him\xe2\x80\x94nor had he ever changed to her\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe was lost.\r\n\r\nAs, one by one, they fell away before his mind\xe2\x80\x94his baby\xe2\x80\x94hope, his wife,\r\nhis friend, his fortune\xe2\x80\x94oh how the mist, through which he had seen her,\r\ncleared, and showed him her true self! Oh, how much better than this\r\nthat he had loved her as he had his boy, and lost her as he had his\r\nboy, and laid them in their early grave together!\r\n\r\nIn his pride\xe2\x80\x94for he was proud yet\xe2\x80\x94he let the world go from him freely.\r\nAs it fell away, he shook it off. Whether he imagined its face as\r\nexpressing pity for him, or indifference to him, he shunned it alike.\r\nIt was in the same degree to be avoided, in either aspect. He had no\r\nidea of any one companion in his misery, but the one he had driven\r\naway. What he would have said to her, or what consolation submitted to\r\nreceive from her, he never pictured to himself. But he always knew she\r\nwould have been true to him, if he had suffered her. He always knew she\r\nwould have loved him better now, than at any other time; he was as\r\ncertain that it was in her nature, as he was that there was a sky above\r\nhim; and he sat thinking so, in his loneliness, from hour to hour. Day\r\nafter day uttered this speech; night after night showed him this\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt began, beyond all doubt (however slow it advanced for some time), in\r\nthe receipt of her young husband\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and the certainty that she\r\nwas gone. And yet\xe2\x80\x94so proud he was in his ruin, or so reminiscent of her\r\nonly as something that might have been his, but was lost beyond\r\nredemption\xe2\x80\x94that if he could have heard her voice in an adjoining room,\r\nhe would not have gone to her. If he could have seen her in the street,\r\nand she had done no more than look at him as she had been used to look,\r\nhe would have passed on with his old cold unforgiving face, and not\r\naddressed her, or relaxed it, though his heart should have broken soon\r\nafterwards. However turbulent his thoughts, or harsh his anger had\r\nbeen, at first, concerning her marriage, or her husband, that was all\r\npast now. He chiefly thought of what might have been, and what was not.\r\nWhat was, was all summed up in this: that she was lost, and he bowed\r\ndown with sorrow and remorse.\r\n\r\nAnd now he felt that he had had two children born to him in that house,\r\nand that between him and the bare wide empty walls there was a tie,\r\nmournful, but hard to rend asunder, connected with a double childhood,\r\nand a double loss. He had thought to leave the house\xe2\x80\x94knowing he must\r\ngo, not knowing whither\xe2\x80\x94upon the evening of the day on which this\r\nfeeling first struck root in his breast; but he resolved to stay\r\nanother night, and in the night to ramble through the rooms once more.\r\n\r\nHe came out of his solitude when it was the dead of night, and with a\r\ncandle in his hand went softly up the stairs. Of all the footmarks\r\nthere, making them as common as the common street, there was not one,\r\nhe thought, but had seemed at the time to set itself upon his brain\r\nwhile he had kept close, listening. He looked at their number, and\r\ntheir hurry, and contention\xe2\x80\x94foot treading foot out, and upward track\r\nand downward jostling one another\xe2\x80\x94and thought, with absolute dread and\r\nwonder, how much he must have suffered during that trial, and what a\r\nchanged man he had cause to be. He thought, besides, oh was there,\r\nsomewhere in the world, a light footstep that might have worn out in a\r\nmoment half those marks!\xe2\x80\x94and bent his head, and wept as he went up.\r\n\r\nHe almost saw it, going on before. He stopped, looking up towards the\r\nskylight; and a figure, childish itself, but carrying a child, and\r\nsinging as it went, seemed to be there again. Anon, it was the same\r\nfigure, alone, stopping for an instant, with suspended breath; the\r\nbright hair clustering loosely round its tearful face; and looking back\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nHe wandered through the rooms: lately so luxurious; now so bare and\r\ndismal and so changed, apparently, even in their shape and size. The\r\npress of footsteps was as thick here; and the same consideration of the\r\nsuffering he had had, perplexed and terrified him. He began to fear\r\nthat all this intricacy in his brain would drive him mad; and that his\r\nthoughts already lost coherence as the footprints did, and were pieced\r\non to one another, with the same trackless involutions, and varieties\r\nof indistinct shapes.\r\n\r\nHe did not so much as know in which of these rooms she had lived, when\r\nshe was alone. He was glad to leave them, and go wandering higher up.\r\nAbundance of associations were here, connected with his false wife, his\r\nfalse friend and servant, his false grounds of pride; but he put them\r\nall by now, and only recalled miserably, weakly, fondly, his two\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, the footsteps! They had had no respect for the old room\r\nhigh up, where the little bed had been; he could hardly find a clear\r\nspace there, to throw himself down, on the floor, against the wall,\r\npoor broken man, and let his tears flow as they would. He had shed so\r\nmany tears here, long ago, that he was less ashamed of his weakness in\r\nthis place than in any other\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, with that consciousness, had made\r\nexcuses to himself for coming here. Here, with stooping shoulders, and\r\nhis chin dropped on his breast, he had come. Here, thrown upon the bare\r\nboards, in the dead of night, he wept, alone\xe2\x80\x94a proud man, even then;\r\nwho, if a kind hand could have been stretched out, or a kind face could\r\nhave looked in, would have risen up, and turned away, and gone down to\r\nhis cell.\r\n\r\nWhen the day broke he was shut up in his rooms again. He had meant to\r\ngo away today, but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only\r\nthing left to him. He would go to-morrow. To-morrow came. He would go\r\nto-morrow. Every night, within the knowledge of no human creature, he\r\ncame forth, and wandered through the despoiled house like a ghost. Many\r\na morning when the day broke, his altered face, drooping behind the\r\nclosed blind in his window, imperfectly transparent to the light as\r\nyet, pondered on the loss of his two children. It was one child no\r\nmore. He reunited them in his thoughts, and they were never asunder.\r\nOh, that he could have united them in his past love, and in death, and\r\nthat one had not been so much worse than dead!\r\n\r\nStrong mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him, even\r\nbefore his late sufferings. It never is, to obstinate and sullen\r\nnatures; for they struggle hard to be such. Ground, long undermined,\r\nwill often fall down in a moment; what was undermined here in so many\r\nways, weakened, and crumbled, little by little, more and more, as the\r\nhand moved on the dial.\r\n\r\nAt last he began to think he need not go at all. He might yet give up\r\nwhat his creditors had spared him (that they had not spared him more,\r\nwas his own act), and only sever the tie between him and the ruined\r\nhouse, by severing that other link\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIt was then that his footfall was audible in the late housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, as he walked to and fro; but not audible in its true meaning, or\r\nit would have had an appalling sound.\r\n\r\nThe world was very busy and restless about him. He became aware of that\r\nagain. It was whispering and babbling. It was never quiet. This, and\r\nthe intricacy and complication of the footsteps, harassed him to death.\r\nObjects began to take a bleared and russet colour in his eyes. Dombey\r\nand Son was no more\xe2\x80\x94his children no more. This must be thought of,\r\nwell, to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHe thought of it to-morrow; and sitting thinking in his chair, saw in\r\nthe glass, from time to time, this picture:\r\n\r\nA spectral, haggard, wasted likeness of himself, brooded and brooded\r\nover the empty fireplace. Now it lifted up its head, examining the\r\nlines and hollows in its face; now hung it down again, and brooded\r\nafresh. Now it rose and walked about; now passed into the next room,\r\nand came back with something from the dressing-table in its breast.\r\nNow, it was looking at the bottom of the door, and thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hush! what?\r\n\r\nIt was thinking that if blood were to trickle that way, and to leak out\r\ninto the hall, it must be a long time going so far. It would move so\r\nstealthily and slowly, creeping on, with here a lazy little pool, and\r\nthere a start, and then another little pool, that a desperately wounded\r\nman could only be discovered through its means, either dead or dying.\r\nWhen it had thought of this a long while, it got up again, and walked\r\nto and fro with its hand in its breast. He glanced at it occasionally,\r\nvery curious to watch its motions, and he marked how wicked and\r\nmurderous that hand looked.\r\n\r\nNow it was thinking again! What was it thinking?\r\n\r\nWhether they would tread in the blood when it crept so far, and carry\r\nit about the house among those many prints of feet, or even out into\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nIt sat down, with its eyes upon the empty fireplace, and as it lost\r\nitself in thought there shone into the room a gleam of light; a ray of\r\nsun. It was quite unmindful, and sat thinking. Suddenly it rose, with a\r\nterrible face, and that guilty hand grasping what was in its breast.\r\nThen it was arrested by a cry\xe2\x80\x94a wild, loud, piercing, loving, rapturous\r\ncry\xe2\x80\x94and he only saw his own reflection in the glass, and at his knees,\r\nhis daughter!\r\n\r\nYes. His daughter! Look at her! Look here! Down upon the ground,\r\nclinging to him, calling to him, folding her hands, praying to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Dearest Papa! Pardon me, forgive me! I have come back to ask\r\nforgiveness on my knees. I never can be happy more, without it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnchanged still. Of all the world, unchanged. Raising the same face to\r\nhis, as on that miserable night. Asking his forgiveness!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Papa, oh don\xe2\x80\x99t look strangely on me! I never meant to leave you.\r\nI never thought of it, before or afterwards. I was frightened when I\r\nwent away, and could not think. Papa, dear, I am changed. I am\r\npenitent. I know my fault. I know my duty better now. Papa, don\xe2\x80\x99t cast\r\nme off, or I shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tottered to his chair. He felt her draw his arms about her neck; he\r\nfelt her put her own round his; he felt her kisses on his face; he felt\r\nher wet cheek laid against his own; he felt\xe2\x80\x94oh, how deeply!\xe2\x80\x94all that he\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nUpon the breast that he had bruised, against the heart that he had\r\nalmost broken, she laid his face, now covered with his hands, and said,\r\nsobbing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, love, I am a mother. I have a child who will soon call Walter by\r\nthe name by which I call you. When it was born, and when I knew how\r\nmuch I loved it, I knew what I had done in leaving you. Forgive me,\r\ndear Papa! oh say God bless me, and my little child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have said it, if he could. He would have raised his hands and\r\nbesought her for pardon, but she caught them in her own, and put them\r\ndown, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little child was born at sea, Papa I prayed to God (and so did\r\nWalter for me) to spare me, that I might come home. The moment I could\r\nland, I came back to you. Never let us be parted any more, Papa. Never\r\nlet us be parted any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis head, now grey, was encircled by her arm; and he groaned to think\r\nthat never, never, had it rested so before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come home with me, Papa, and see my baby. A boy, Papa. His\r\nname is Paul. I think\xe2\x80\x94I hope\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tears stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Papa, for the sake of my child, for the sake of the name we have\r\ngiven him, for my sake, pardon Walter. He is so kind and tender to me.\r\nI am so happy with him. It was not his fault that we were married. It\r\nwas mine. I loved him so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clung closer to him, more endearing and more earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the darling of my heart, Papa I would die for him. He will love\r\nand honour you as I will. We will teach our little child to love and\r\nhonour you; and we will tell him, when he can understand, that you had\r\na son of that name once, and that he died, and you were very sorry; but\r\nthat he is gone to Heaven, where we all hope to see him when our time\r\nfor resting comes. Kiss me, Papa, as a promise that you will be\r\nreconciled to Walter\xe2\x80\x94to my dearest husband\xe2\x80\x94to the father of the little\r\nchild who taught me to come back, Papa Who taught me to come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she clung closer to him, in another burst of tears, he kissed her on\r\nher lips, and, lifting up his eyes, said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my God, forgive me, for I\r\nneed it very much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he dropped his head again, lamenting over and caressing her,\r\nand there was not a sound in all the house for a long, long time; they\r\nremaining clasped in one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms, in the glorious sunshine that\r\nhad crept in with Florence.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself for going out, with a docile submission to her\r\nentreaty; and walking with a feeble gait, and looking back, with a\r\ntremble, at the room in which he had been so long shut up, and where he\r\nhad seen the picture in the glass, passed out with her into the hall.\r\nFlorence, hardly glancing round her, lest she should remind him freshly\r\nof their last parting\xe2\x80\x94for their feet were on the very stones where he\r\nhad struck her in his madness\xe2\x80\x94and keeping close to him, with her eyes\r\nupon his face, and his arm about her, led him out to a coach that was\r\nwaiting at the door, and carried him away.\r\n\r\nThen, Miss Tox and Polly came out of their concealment, and exulted\r\ntearfully. And then they packed his clothes, and books, and so forth,\r\nwith great care; and consigned them in due course to certain persons\r\nsent by Florence, in the evening, to fetch them. And then they took a\r\nlast cup of tea in the lonely house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so Dombey and Son, as I observed upon a certain sad occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Tox, winding up a host of recollections, \xe2\x80\x9cis indeed a\r\ndaughter, Polly, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a good one!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Polly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s a credit to you, Polly, that\r\nyou were always her friend when she was a little child. You were her\r\nfriend long before I was, Polly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99re a good\r\ncreature. Robin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Tox addressed herself to a bullet-headed young man, who appeared\r\nto be in but indifferent circumstances, and in depressed spirits, and\r\nwho was sitting in a remote corner. Rising, he disclosed to view the\r\nform and features of the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI have just observed to your mother, as you\r\nmay have heard, that she is a good creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she is, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Grinder, with some feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear you say so. Now,\r\nRobin, as I am going to give you a trial, at your urgent request, as my\r\ndomestic, with a view to your restoration to respectability, I will\r\ntake this impressive occasion of remarking that I hope you will never\r\nforget that you have, and have always had, a good mother, and that you\r\nwill endeavour so to conduct yourself as to be a comfort to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul I will, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come through\r\na good deal, and my intentions is now as straightfor\xe2\x80\x99ard, Miss, as a\r\ncove\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must get you to break yourself of that word, Robin, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterposed Miss Tox, politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Miss, as a chap\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Robin, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Tox, \xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a indiwiddle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Tox, complacently; \xe2\x80\x9cinfinitely more\r\nexpressive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94can be,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Rob. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been and got made a Grinder on,\r\nMiss and Mother, which was a most unfortunate circumstance for a young\r\nco\xe2\x80\x94indiwiddle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Tox, approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been led away by birds, and then fallen into a bad\r\nservice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I might have done better. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever too late for a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Tox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94widdle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grinder, \xe2\x80\x9cto mend; and I hope to mend, Miss, with\r\nyour kind trial; and wishing, Mother, my love to father, and brothers\r\nand sisters, and saying of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad indeed to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miss Tox. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take a\r\nlittle bread and butter, and a cup of tea, before we go, Robin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Grinder; who immediately began to use his\r\nown personal grinders in a most remarkable manner, as if he had been on\r\nvery short allowance for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nMiss Tox, being, in good time, bonneted and shawled, and Polly too, Rob\r\nhugged his mother, and followed his new mistress away; so much to the\r\nhopeful admiration of Polly, that something in her eyes made luminous\r\nrings round the gas-lamps as she looked after him. Polly then put out\r\nher light, locked the house-door, delivered the key at an agent\xe2\x80\x99s hard\r\nby, and went home as fast as she could go; rejoicing in the shrill\r\ndelight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there. The great\r\nhouse, dumb as to all that had been suffered in it, and the changes it\r\nhad witnessed, stood frowning like a dark mute on the street; baulking\r\nany nearer inquiries with the staring announcement that the lease of\r\nthis desirable Family Mansion was to be disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nChiefly Matrimonial\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grand half-yearly festival holden by Doctor and Mrs Blimber, on\r\nwhich occasion they requested the pleasure of the company of every\r\nyoung gentleman pursuing his studies in that genteel establishment, at\r\nan early party, when the hour was half-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and when the\r\nobject was quadrilles, had duly taken place, about this time; and the\r\nyoung gentlemen, with no unbecoming demonstrations of levity, had\r\nbetaken themselves, in a state of scholastic repletion, to their own\r\nhomes. Mr Skettles had repaired abroad, permanently to grace the\r\nestablishment of his father Sir Barnet Skettles, whose popular manners\r\nhad obtained him a diplomatic appointment, the honours of which were\r\ndischarged by himself and Lady Skettles, to the satisfaction even of\r\ntheir own countrymen and countrywomen: which was considered almost\r\nmiraculous. Mr Tozer, now a young man of lofty stature, in Wellington\r\nboots, was so extremely full of antiquity as to be nearly on a par with\r\na genuine ancient Roman in his knowledge of English: a triumph that\r\naffected his good parents with the tenderest emotions, and caused the\r\nfather and mother of Mr Briggs (whose learning, like ill-arranged\r\nluggage, was so tightly packed that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at anything he\r\nwanted) to hide their diminished heads. The fruit laboriously gathered\r\nfrom the tree of knowledge by this latter young gentleman, in fact, had\r\nbeen subjected to so much pressure, that it had become a kind of\r\nintellectual Norfolk Biffin, and had nothing of its original form or\r\nflavour remaining. Master Bitherstone now, on whom the forcing system\r\nhad the happier and not uncommon effect of leaving no impression\r\nwhatever, when the forcing apparatus ceased to work, was in a much more\r\ncomfortable plight; and being then on shipboard, bound for Bengal,\r\nfound himself forgetting, with such admirable rapidity, that it was\r\ndoubtful whether his declensions of noun-substantives would hold out to\r\nthe end of the voyage.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Blimber, in pursuance of the usual course, would have said\r\nto the young gentlemen, on the morning of the party, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we\r\nwill resume our studies on the twenty-fifth of next month,\xe2\x80\x9d he departed\r\nfrom the usual course, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, when our friend\r\nCincinnatus retired to his farm, he did not present to the senate any\r\nRoman who he sought to nominate as his successor. But there is a Roman\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Blimber, laying his hand on the shoulder of Mr\r\nFeeder, B.A., \xe2\x80\x9cadolescens imprimis gravis et doctus, gentlemen, whom I,\r\na retiring Cincinnatus, wish to present to my little senate, as their\r\nfuture Dictator. Gentlemen, we will resume our studies on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of next month, under the auspices of Mr Feeder, B.A.\xe2\x80\x9d At\r\nthis (which Doctor Blimber had previously called upon all the parents,\r\nand urbanely explained), the young gentlemen cheered; and Mr Tozer, on\r\nbehalf of the rest, instantly presented the Doctor with a silver\r\ninkstand, in a speech containing very little of the mother-tongue, but\r\nfifteen quotations from the Latin, and seven from the Greek, which\r\nmoved the younger of the young gentlemen to discontent and envy: they\r\nremarking, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah. It was all very well for old Tozer, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsubscribe money for old Tozer to show off with, they supposed; did\r\nthey? What business was it of old Tozer\xe2\x80\x99s more than anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s? It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t his inkstand. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he leave the boys\xe2\x80\x99 property alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand murmuring other expressions of their dissatisfaction, which seemed\r\nto find a greater relief in calling him old Tozer, than in any other\r\navailable vent.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been said to the young gentlemen, nor a hint dropped, of\r\nanything like a contemplated marriage between Mr Feeder, B.A., and the\r\nfair Cornelia Blimber. Doctor Blimber, especially, seemed to take pains\r\nto look as if nothing would surprise him more; but it was perfectly\r\nwell known to all the young gentlemen nevertheless, and when they\r\ndeparted for the society of their relations and friends, they took\r\nleave of Mr Feeder with awe.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s most romantic visions were fulfilled. The Doctor had\r\ndetermined to paint the house outside, and put it in thorough repair;\r\nand to give up the business, and to give up Cornelia. The painting and\r\nrepairing began upon the very day of the young gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s departure,\r\nand now behold! the wedding morning was come, and Cornelia, in a new\r\npair of spectacles, was waiting to be led to the hymeneal altar.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor with his learned legs, and Mrs Blimber in a lilac bonnet,\r\nand Mr Feeder, B.A., with his long knuckles and his bristly head of\r\nhair, and Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the Reverend Alfred Feeder, M.A., who\r\nwas to perform the ceremony, were all assembled in the drawing-room,\r\nand Cornelia with her orange-flowers and bridesmaids had just come\r\ndown, and looked, as of old, a little squeezed in appearance, but very\r\ncharming, when the door opened, and the weak-eyed young man, in a loud\r\nvoice, made the following proclamation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR AND MRS TOOTS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon which there entered Mr Toots, grown extremely stout, and on his\r\narm a lady very handsomely and becomingly dressed, with very bright\r\nblack eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Blimber,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9callow me to present my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber was delighted to receive her. Mrs Blimber was a little\r\ncondescending, but extremely kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as you\xe2\x80\x99ve known me for a long time, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nme assure you that she is one of the most remarkable women that ever\r\nlived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mrs Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word and honour she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I assure you, Mrs\r\nBlimber, she\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toots laughed merrily, and Mrs Blimber led her to Cornelia. Mr\r\nToots having paid his respects in that direction and having saluted his\r\nold preceptor, who said, in allusion to his conjugal state, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nToots, well, Toots! So you are one of us, are you, Toots?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94retired with\r\nMr Feeder, B.A., into a window.\r\n\r\nMr Feeder, B.A., being in great spirits, made a spar at Mr Toots, and\r\ntapped him skilfully with the back of his hand on the breastbone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old Buck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Here we are!\r\nTaken in and done for. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeeder,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI give you joy. If you\xe2\x80\x99re as\xe2\x80\x94as\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nperfectly blissful in a matrimonial life, as I am myself, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nnothing to desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t forget my old friends, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask em to\r\nmy wedding, Toots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeeder,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact is, that there were\r\nseveral circumstances which prevented me from communicating with you\r\nuntil after my marriage had been solemnised. In the first place, I had\r\nmade a perfect brute of myself to you, on the subject of Miss Dombey;\r\nand I felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine, you would\r\nnaturally expect that it was with Miss Dombey, which involved\r\nexplanations, that upon my word and honour, at that crisis, would have\r\nknocked me completely over. In the second place, our wedding was\r\nstrictly private; there being nobody present but one friend of myself\r\nand Mrs Toots\xe2\x80\x99s, who is a Captain in\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know in what,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence. I hope, Feeder, that in\r\nwriting a statement of what had occurred before Mrs Toots and myself\r\nwent abroad upon our foreign tour, I fully discharged the offices of\r\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToots, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder, shaking his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI was joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Feeder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad to know what you\r\nthink of my union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s capital, do you, Feeder?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nhow capital must it be to Me! For you can never know what an\r\nextraordinary woman that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Feeder was willing to take it for granted. But Mr Toots shook his\r\nhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of that being possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I wanted in a wife was\xe2\x80\x94in short, was\r\nsense. Money, Feeder, I had. Sense I\xe2\x80\x94I had not, particularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Feeder murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you had, Toots!\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr Toots said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Feeder, I had not. Why should I disguise it? I had not. I knew\r\nthat sense was There,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, stretching out his hand towards\r\nhis wife, \xe2\x80\x9cin perfect heaps. I had no relation to object or be\r\noffended, on the score of station; for I had no relation. I have never\r\nhad anybody belonging to me but my guardian, and him, Feeder, I have\r\nalways considered as a Pirate and a Corsair. Therefore, you know it was\r\nnot likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should take his opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Feeder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccordingly,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI acted on my own. Bright was the day\r\non which I did so! Feeder! Nobody but myself can tell what the capacity\r\nof that woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind is. If ever the Rights of Women, and all that kind\r\nof thing, are properly attended to, it will be through her powerful\r\nintellect\xe2\x80\x94Susan, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, looking abruptly out of the\r\nwindows \xe2\x80\x9cpray do not exert yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI was only talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cpray do not exert yourself. You really\r\nmust be careful. Do not, my dear Susan, exert yourself. She\xe2\x80\x99s so easily\r\nexcited,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, apart to Mrs Blimber, \xe2\x80\x9cand then she forgets\r\nthe medical man altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Blimber was impressing on Mrs Toots the necessity of caution, when\r\nMr Feeder, B.A., offered her his arm, and led her down to the carriages\r\nthat were waiting to go to church. Doctor Blimber escorted Mrs Toots.\r\nMr Toots escorted the fair bride, around whose lambent spectacles two\r\ngauzy little bridesmaids fluttered like moths. Mr Feeder\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Mr\r\nAlfred Feeder, M.A., had already gone on, in advance, to assume his\r\nofficial functions.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was performed in an admirable manner. Cornelia, with her\r\ncrisp little curls, \xe2\x80\x9cwent in,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Chicken might have said, with\r\ngreat composure; and Doctor Blimber gave her away, like a man who had\r\nquite made up his mind to it. The gauzy little bridesmaids appeared to\r\nsuffer most. Mrs Blimber was affected, but gently so; and told the\r\nReverend Mr Alfred Feeder, M.A., on the way home, that if she could\r\nonly have seen Cicero in his retirement at Tusculum, she would not have\r\nhad a wish, now, ungratified.\r\n\r\nThere was a breakfast afterwards, limited to the same small party; at\r\nwhich the spirits of Mr Feeder, B.A., were tremendous, and so\r\ncommunicated themselves to Mrs Toots that Mr Toots was several times\r\nheard to observe, across the table, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Susan, don\xe2\x80\x99t exert\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d The best of it was, that Mr Toots felt it incumbent on him\r\nto make a speech; and in spite of a whole code of telegraphic\r\ndissuasions from Mrs Toots, appeared on his legs for the first time in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cin this house, where whatever was done to\r\nme in the way of\xe2\x80\x94of any mental confusion sometimes\xe2\x80\x94which is of no\r\nconsequence and I impute to nobody\xe2\x80\x94I was always treated like one of\r\nDoctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s family, and had a desk to myself for a considerable\r\nperiod\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94allow\xe2\x80\x94my friend Feeder to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toots suggested \xe2\x80\x9cmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may not be inappropriate to the occasion, or altogether\r\nuninteresting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots with a delighted face, \xe2\x80\x9cto observe that\r\nmy wife is a most extraordinary woman, and would do this much better\r\nthan myself\xe2\x80\x94allow my friend Feeder to be married\xe2\x80\x94especially to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toots suggested \xe2\x80\x9cto Miss Blimber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mrs Feeder, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, in a subdued tone of private\r\ndiscussion: \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cwhom God hath joined,\xe2\x80\x99 you know, \xe2\x80\x98let no man\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow? I cannot allow my friend Feeder to be married\xe2\x80\x94especially to Mrs\r\nFeeder\xe2\x80\x94without proposing their\xe2\x80\x94their\xe2\x80\x94Toasts; and may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots,\r\nfixing his eyes on his wife, as if for inspiration in a high flight,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmay the torch of Hymen be the beacon of joy, and may the flowers we\r\nhave this day strewed in their path, be the\xe2\x80\x94the banishers of\xe2\x80\x94of gloom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Blimber, who had a taste for metaphor, was pleased with this,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Toots! Very well said, indeed, Toots!\xe2\x80\x9d and nodded\r\nhis head and patted his hands. Mr Feeder made in reply, a comic speech\r\nchequered with sentiment. Mr Alfred Feeder, M.A., was afterwards very\r\nhappy on Doctor and Mrs Blimber; Mr Feeder, B.A., scarcely less so, on\r\nthe gauzy little bridesmaids. Doctor Blimber then, in a sonorous voice,\r\ndelivered a few thoughts in the pastoral style, relative to the rushes\r\namong which it was the intention of himself and Mrs Blimber to dwell,\r\nand the bee that would hum around their cot. Shortly after which, as\r\nthe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were twinkling in a remarkable manner, and his\r\nson-in-law had already observed that time was made for slaves, and had\r\ninquired whether Mrs Toots sang, the discreet Mrs Blimber dissolved the\r\nsitting, and sent Cornelia away, very cool and comfortable, in a\r\npost-chaise, with the man of her heart.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Toots withdrew to the Bedford (Mrs Toots had been there\r\nbefore in old times, under her maiden name of Nipper), and there found\r\na letter, which it took Mr Toots such an enormous time to read, that\r\nMrs Toots was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cfright is worse than exertion. Pray be\r\ncalm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s from Captain Gills. Do not excite\r\nyourself. Walters and Miss Dombey are expected home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Toots, raising herself quickly from the sofa, very\r\npale, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to deceive me, for it\xe2\x80\x99s no use, they\xe2\x80\x99re come home\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsee it plainly in your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr Toots, in rapturous\r\nadmiration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly right, my love, they have come home. Miss\r\nDombey has seen her father, and they are reconciled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReconciled!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Toots, clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots; \xe2\x80\x9cpray do not exert yourself. Do remember the\r\nmedical man! Captain Gills says\xe2\x80\x94at least he don\xe2\x80\x99t say, but I imagine,\r\nfrom what I can make out, he means\xe2\x80\x94that Miss Dombey has brought her\r\nunfortunate father away from his old house, to one where she and\r\nWalters are living; that he is lying very ill there\xe2\x80\x94supposed to be\r\ndying; and that she attends upon him night and day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Toots began to cry quite bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cdo, do, if you possibly can,\r\nremember the medical man! If you can\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence\xe2\x80\x94but do\r\nendeavour to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife, with her old manner suddenly restored, so pathetically\r\nentreated him to take her to her precious pet, her little mistress, her\r\nown darling, and the like, that Mr Toots, whose sympathy and admiration\r\nwere of the strongest kind, consented from his very heart of hearts;\r\nand they agreed to depart immediately, and present themselves in answer\r\nto the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nNow some hidden sympathies of things, or some coincidences, had that\r\nday brought the Captain himself (toward whom Mr and Mrs Toots were soon\r\njourneying) into the flowery train of wedlock; not as a principal, but\r\nas an accessory. It happened accidentally, and thus:\r\n\r\nThe Captain, having seen Florence and her baby for a moment, to his\r\nunbounded content, and having had a long talk with Walter, turned out\r\nfor a walk; feeling it necessary to have some solitary meditation on\r\nthe changes of human affairs, and to shake his glazed hat profoundly\r\nover the fall of Mr Dombey, for whom the generosity and simplicity of\r\nhis nature were awakened in a lively manner. The Captain would have\r\nbeen very low, indeed, on the unhappy gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s account, but for the\r\nrecollection of the baby; which afforded him such intense satisfaction\r\nwhenever it arose, that he laughed aloud as he went along the street,\r\nand, indeed, more than once, in a sudden impulse of joy, threw up his\r\nglazed hat and caught it again; much to the amazement of the\r\nspectators. The rapid alternations of light and shade to which these\r\ntwo conflicting subjects of reflection exposed the Captain, were so\r\nvery trying to his spirits, that he felt a long walk necessary to his\r\ncomposure; and as there is a great deal in the influence of harmonious\r\nassociations, he chose, for the scene of this walk, his old\r\nneighbourhood, down among the mast, oar, and block makers, ship-biscuit\r\nbakers, coal-whippers, pitch-kettles, sailors, canals, docks,\r\nswing-bridges, and other soothing objects.\r\n\r\nThese peaceful scenes, and particularly the region of Limehouse Hole\r\nand thereabouts, were so influential in calming the Captain, that he\r\nwalked on with restored tranquillity, and was, in fact, regaling\r\nhimself, under his breath, with the ballad of Lovely Peg, when, on\r\nturning a corner, he was suddenly transfixed and rendered speechless by\r\na triumphant procession that he beheld advancing towards him.\r\n\r\nThis awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman Mrs\r\nMacStinger, who, preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution, and\r\nwearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch\r\nand appendages, which the Captain recognised at a glance as the\r\nproperty of Bunsby, conducted under her arm no other than that\r\nsagacious mariner; he, with the distraught and melancholy visage of a\r\ncaptive borne into a foreign land, meekly resigning himself to her\r\nwill. Behind them appeared the young MacStingers, in a body, exulting.\r\nBehind them, two ladies of a terrible and steadfast aspect, leading\r\nbetween them a short gentleman in a tall hat, who likewise exulted. In\r\nthe wake, appeared Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s boy, bearing umbrellas. The whole were in\r\ngood marching order; and a dreadful smartness that pervaded the party\r\nwould have sufficiently announced, if the intrepid countenances of the\r\nladies had been wanting, that it was a procession of sacrifice, and\r\nthat the victim was Bunsby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first impulse of the Captain was to run away. This also appeared to\r\nbe the first impulse of Bunsby, hopeless as its execution must have\r\nproved. But a cry of recognition proceeding from the party, and\r\nAlexander MacStinger running up to the Captain with open arms, the\r\nCaptain struck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed a meeting!\r\nI bear no malice now, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear that I\xe2\x80\x99m a going\r\nto cast any reflections. I hope to go to the altar in another spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere Mrs MacStinger paused, and drawing herself up, and inflating her\r\nbosom with a long breath, said, in allusion to the victim, \xe2\x80\x9cMy \xe2\x80\x9cusband,\r\nCap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe abject Bunsby looked neither to the right nor to the left, nor at\r\nhis bride, nor at his friend, but straight before him at nothing. The\r\nCaptain putting out his hand, Bunsby put out his; but, in answer to the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s greeting, spake no word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99en Cuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, \xe2\x80\x9cif you would wish to heal up\r\npast animosities, and to see the last of your friend, my \xe2\x80\x9cusband, as a\r\nsingle person, we should be \xe2\x80\x9cappy of your company to chapel. Here is a\r\nlady here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs MacStinger, turning round to the more intrepid of\r\nthe two, \xe2\x80\x9cmy bridesmaid, that will be glad of your protection, Cap\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nCuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe short gentleman in the tall hat, who it appeared was the husband of\r\nthe other lady, and who evidently exulted at the reduction of a fellow\r\ncreature to his own condition, gave place at this, and resigned the\r\nlady to Captain Cuttle. The lady immediately seized him, and, observing\r\nthat there was no time to lose, gave the word, in a strong voice, to\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s concern for his friend, not unmingled, at first, with\r\nsome concern for himself\xe2\x80\x94for a shadowy terror that he might be married\r\nby violence, possessed him, until his knowledge of the service came to\r\nhis relief, and remembering the legal obligation of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved, if asked any\r\nquestion, distinctly to reply \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94threw him into a profuse\r\nperspiration; and rendered him, for a time, insensible to the movements\r\nof the procession, of which he now formed a feature, and to the\r\nconversation of his fair companion. But as he became less agitated, he\r\nlearnt from this lady that she was the widow of a Mr Bokum, who had\r\nheld an employment in the Custom House; that she was the dearest friend\r\nof Mrs MacStinger, whom she considered a pattern for her sex; that she\r\nhad often heard of the Captain, and now hoped he had repented of his\r\npast life; that she trusted Mr Bunsby knew what a blessing he had\r\ngained, but that she feared men seldom did know what such blessings\r\nwere, until they had lost them; with more to the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAll this time, the Captain could not but observe that Mrs Bokum kept\r\nher eyes steadily on the bridegroom, and that whenever they came near a\r\ncourt or other narrow turning which appeared favourable for flight, she\r\nwas on the alert to cut him off if he attempted escape. The other lady,\r\ntoo, as well as her husband, the short gentleman with the tall hat,\r\nwere plainly on guard, according to a preconcerted plan; and the\r\nwretched man was so secured by Mrs MacStinger, that any effort at\r\nself-preservation by flight was rendered futile. This, indeed, was\r\napparent to the mere populace, who expressed their perception of the\r\nfact by jeers and cries; to all of which, the dread MacStinger was\r\ninflexibly indifferent, while Bunsby himself appeared in a state of\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe Captain made many attempts to accost the philosopher, if only in a\r\nmonosyllable or a signal; but always failed, in consequence of the\r\nvigilance of the guard, and the difficulty, at all times peculiar to\r\nBunsby\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, of having his attention aroused by any outward\r\nand visible sign whatever. Thus they approached the chapel, a neat\r\nwhitewashed edifice, recently engaged by the Reverend Melchisedech\r\nHowler, who had consented, on very urgent solicitation, to give the\r\nworld another two years of existence, but had informed his followers\r\nthat, then, it must positively go.\r\n\r\nWhile the Reverend Melchisedech was offering up some extemporary\r\norisons, the Captain found an opportunity of growling in the\r\nbridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer, my lad, what cheer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Bunsby replied, with a forgetfulness of the Reverend\r\nMelchisedech, which nothing but his desperate circumstances could have\r\nexcused:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d bad,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack Bunsby,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you do this here, of your own\r\nfree will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Bunsby answered \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do it, then, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Captain, not\r\nunnaturally.\r\n\r\nBunsby, still looking, and always looking with an immovable\r\ncountenance, at the opposite side of the world, made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not sheer off?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Bunsby, with a\r\nmomentary gleam of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSheer off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the forlorn sage. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d capter me agen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cCheer up! Come! Now\xe2\x80\x99s your time. Sheer\r\noff, Jack Bunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack Bunsby, however, instead of profiting by the advice, said in a\r\ndoleful whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all began in that there chest o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn. Why did I ever conwoy her\r\ninto port that night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lad,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought as you had come over her;\r\nnot as she had come over you. A man as has got such opinions as you\r\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Bunsby merely uttered a suppressed groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, nudging him with his elbow, \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x99s your time!\r\nSheer off! I\xe2\x80\x99ll cover your retreat. The time\xe2\x80\x99s a flying. Bunsby! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor liberty. Will you once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunsby was immovable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you twice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunsby wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunsby!\xe2\x80\x9d urged the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s for liberty; will you three times?\r\nNow or never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunsby didn\xe2\x80\x99t then, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever; for Mrs MacStinger immediately\r\nafterwards married him.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frightful circumstances of the ceremony to the Captain,\r\nwas the deadly interest exhibited therein by Juliana MacStinger; and\r\nthe fatal concentration of her faculties, with which that promising\r\nchild, already the image of her parent, observed the whole proceedings.\r\nThe Captain saw in this a succession of man-traps stretching out\r\ninfinitely; a series of ages of oppression and coercion, through which\r\nthe seafaring line was doomed. It was a more memorable sight than the\r\nunflinching steadiness of Mrs Bokum and the other lady, the exultation\r\nof the short gentleman in the tall hat, or even the fell inflexibility\r\nof Mrs MacStinger. The Master MacStingers understood little of what was\r\ngoing on, and cared less; being chiefly engaged, during the ceremony,\r\nin treading on one another\xe2\x80\x99s half-boots; but the contrast afforded by\r\nthose wretched infants only set off and adorned the precocious woman in\r\nJuliana. Another year or two, the Captain thought, and to lodge where\r\nthat child was, would be destruction.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was concluded by a general spring of the young family on\r\nMr Bunsby, whom they hailed by the endearing name of father, and from\r\nwhom they solicited half-pence. These gushes of affection over, the\r\nprocession was about to issue forth again, when it was delayed for some\r\nlittle time by an unexpected transport on the part of Alexander\r\nMacStinger. That dear child, it seemed, connecting a chapel with\r\ntombstones, when it was entered for any purpose apart from the ordinary\r\nreligious exercises, could not be persuaded but that his mother was now\r\nto be decently interred, and lost to him for ever. In the anguish of\r\nthis conviction, he screamed with astonishing force, and turned black\r\nin the face. However touching these marks of a tender disposition were\r\nto his mother, it was not in the character of that remarkable woman to\r\npermit her recognition of them to degenerate into weakness. Therefore,\r\nafter vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes, pokes,\r\nbawlings-out, and similar applications to his head, she led him into\r\nthe air, and tried another method; which was manifested to the marriage\r\nparty by a quick succession of sharp sounds, resembling applause, and\r\nsubsequently, by their seeing Alexander in contact with the coolest\r\npaving-stone in the court, greatly flushed, and loudly lamenting.\r\n\r\nThe procession being then in a condition to form itself once more, and\r\nrepair to Brig Place, where a marriage feast was in readiness, returned\r\nas it had come; not without the receipt, by Bunsby, of many humorous\r\ncongratulations from the populace on his recently-acquired happiness.\r\nThe Captain accompanied it as far as the house-door, but, being made\r\nuneasy by the gentler manner of Mrs Bokum, who, now that she was\r\nrelieved from her engrossing duty\xe2\x80\x94for the watchfulness and alacrity of\r\nthe ladies sensibly diminished when the bridegroom was safely\r\nmarried\xe2\x80\x94had greater leisure to show an interest in his behalf, there\r\nleft it and the captive; faintly pleading an appointment, and promising\r\nto return presently. The Captain had another cause for uneasiness, in\r\nremorsefully reflecting that he had been the first means of Bunsby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrapment, though certainly without intending it, and through his\r\nunbounded faith in the resources of that philosopher.\r\n\r\nTo go back to old Sol Gills at the wooden Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s, and not first\r\ngo round to ask how Mr Dombey was\xe2\x80\x94albeit the house where he lay was out\r\nof London, and away on the borders of a fresh heath\xe2\x80\x94was quite out of\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s course. So he got a lift when he was tired, and made out\r\nthe journey gaily.\r\n\r\nThe blinds were pulled down, and the house so quiet, that the Captain\r\nwas almost afraid to knock; but listening at the door, he heard low\r\nvoices within, very near it, and, knocking softly, was admitted by Mr\r\nToots. Mr Toots and his wife had, in fact, just arrived there; having\r\nbeen at the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s to seek him, and having there obtained the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThey were not so recently arrived, but that Mrs Toots had caught the\r\nbaby from somebody, taken it in her arms, and sat down on the stairs,\r\nhugging and fondling it. Florence was stooping down beside her; and no\r\none could have said which Mrs Toots was hugging and fondling most, the\r\nmother or the child, or which was the tenderer, Florence of Mrs Toots,\r\nor Mrs Toots of her, or both of the baby; it was such a little group of\r\nlove and agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is your Pa very ill, my darling dear Miss Floy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very, very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Susan, dear, you must not\r\nspeak to me as you used to speak. And what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence,\r\ntouching her clothes, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cYour old dress, dear? Your old\r\ncap, curls, and all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan burst into tears, and showered kisses on the little hand that had\r\ntouched her so wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Dombey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, stepping forward, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll explain.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary woman. There are not many to equal her!\r\nShe has always said\xe2\x80\x94she said before we were married, and has said to\r\nthis day\xe2\x80\x94that whenever you came home, she\xe2\x80\x99d come to you in no dress but\r\nthe dress she used to serve you in, for fear she might seem strange to\r\nyou, and you might like her less. I admire the dress myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr\r\nToots, \xe2\x80\x9cof all things. I adore her in it! My dear Miss Dombey, she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe your maid again, your nurse, all that she ever was, and more.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no change in her. But, Susan, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, who had\r\nspoken with great feeling and high admiration, \xe2\x80\x9call I ask is, that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll remember the medical man, and not exert yourself too much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nRelenting\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence had need of help. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s need of it was sore, and made\r\nthe aid of her old friend invaluable. Death stood at his pillow. A\r\nshade, already, of what he had been, shattered in mind, and perilously\r\nsick in body, he laid his weary head down on the bed his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands prepared for him, and had never raised it since.\r\n\r\nShe was always with him. He knew her, generally; though, in the\r\nwandering of his brain, he often confused the circumstances under which\r\nhe spoke to her. Thus he would address her, sometimes, as if his boy\r\nwere newly dead; and would tell her, that although he had said nothing\r\nof her ministering at the little bedside, yet he had seen it\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nseen it; and then would hide his face and sob, and put out his worn\r\nhand. Sometimes he would ask her for herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam here, Papa, I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her!\xe2\x80\x9d he would cry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nbeen parted so long, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her!\xe2\x80\x9d and then a staring dread\r\nwould be upon him, until she could soothe his perturbation; and recall\r\nthe tears she tried so hard, at other times, to dry.\r\n\r\nHe rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits\xe2\x80\x94through many where\r\nFlorence lost him as she listened\xe2\x80\x94sometimes for hours. He would repeat\r\nthat childish question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is money?\xe2\x80\x9d and ponder on it, and think\r\nabout it, and reason with himself, more or less connectedly, for a good\r\nanswer; as if it had never been proposed to him until that moment. He\r\nwould go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm\r\ntwenty thousand times, and at every one of them, would turn his head\r\nupon his pillow. He would count his children\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94stop, and go back,\r\nand begin again in the same way.\r\n\r\nBut this was when his mind was in its most distracted state. In all the\r\nother phases of its illness, and in those to which it was most\r\nconstant, it always turned on Florence. What he would oftenest do was\r\nthis: he would recall that night he had so recently remembered, the\r\nnight on which she came down to his room, and would imagine that his\r\nheart smote him, and that he went out after her, and up the stairs to\r\nseek her. Then, confounding that time with the later days of the many\r\nfootsteps, he would be amazed at their number, and begin to count them\r\nas he followed her. Here, of a sudden, was a bloody footstep going on\r\namong the others; and after it there began to be, at intervals, doors\r\nstanding open, through which certain terrible pictures were seen, in\r\nmirrors, of haggard men, concealing something in their breasts. Still,\r\namong the many footsteps and the bloody footsteps here and there, was\r\nthe step of Florence. Still she was going on before. Still the restless\r\nmind went, following and counting, ever farther, ever higher, as to the\r\nsummit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb.\r\n\r\nOne day he inquired if that were not Susan who had spoken a long while\r\nago.\r\n\r\nFlorence said \xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Papa;\xe2\x80\x9d and asked him would he like to see her?\r\n\r\nHe said \xe2\x80\x9cvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d And Susan, with no little trepidation, showed\r\nherself at his bedside.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a great relief to him. He begged her not to go; to understand\r\nthat he forgave her what she had said; and that she was to stay.\r\nFlorence and he were very different now, he said, and very happy. Let\r\nher look at this! He meant his drawing the gentle head down to his\r\npillow, and laying it beside him.\r\n\r\nHe remained like this for days and weeks. At length, lying, the faint\r\nfeeble semblance of a man, upon his bed, and speaking in a voice so low\r\nthat they could only hear him by listening very near to his lips, he\r\nbecame quiet. It was dimly pleasant to him now, to lie there, with the\r\nwindow open, looking out at the summer sky and the trees: and, in the\r\nevening, at the sunset. To watch the shadows of the clouds and leaves,\r\nand seem to feel a sympathy with shadows. It was natural that he\r\nshould. To him, life and the world were nothing else.\r\n\r\nHe began to show now that he thought of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue: and often\r\ntaxed his weakness to whisper to her, \xe2\x80\x9cGo and walk, my dearest, in the\r\nsweet air. Go to your good husband!\xe2\x80\x9d One time when Walter was in his\r\nroom, he beckoned him to come near, and to stoop down; and pressing his\r\nhand, whispered an assurance to him that he knew he could trust him\r\nwith his child when he was dead.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one evening, towards sunset, when Florence and Walter were\r\nsitting in his room together, as he liked to see them, that Florence,\r\nhaving her baby in her arms, began in a low voice to sing to the little\r\nfellow, and sang the old tune she had so often sung to the dead child:\r\nHe could not bear it at the time; he held up his trembling hand,\r\nimploring her to stop; but next day he asked her to repeat it, and to\r\ndo so often of an evening: which she did. He listening, with his face\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\nFlorence was sitting on a certain time by his window, with her\r\nwork-basket between her and her old attendant, who was still her\r\nfaithful companion. He had fallen into a doze. It was a beautiful\r\nevening, with two hours of light to come yet; and the tranquillity and\r\nquiet made Florence very thoughtful. She was lost to everything for the\r\nmoment, but the occasion when the so altered figure on the bed had\r\nfirst presented her to her beautiful Mama; when a touch from Walter\r\nleaning on the back of her chair, made her start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is someone downstairs who wishes to\r\nspeak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fancied Walter looked grave, and asked him if anything had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the gentleman myself, and\r\nspoken with him. Nothing has happened. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence put her arm through his; and confiding her father to the\r\nblack-eyed Mrs Toots, who sat as brisk and smart at her work as\r\nblack-eyed woman could, accompanied her husband downstairs. In the\r\npleasant little parlour opening on the garden, sat a gentleman, who\r\nrose to advance towards her when she came in, but turned off, by reason\r\nof some peculiarity in his legs, and was only stopped by the table.\r\n\r\nFlorence then remembered Cousin Feenix, whom she had not at first\r\nrecognised in the shade of the leaves. Cousin Feenix took her hand, and\r\ncongratulated her upon her marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have wished, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, sitting down as\r\nFlorence sat, \xe2\x80\x9cto have had an earlier opportunity of offering my\r\ncongratulations; but, in point of fact, so many painful occurrences\r\nhave happened, treading, as a man may say, on one another\xe2\x80\x99s heels, that\r\nI have been in a devil of a state myself, and perfectly unfit for every\r\ndescription of society. The only description of society I have kept,\r\nhas been my own; and it certainly is anything but flattering to a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood opinion of his own sources, to know that, in point of fact, he has\r\nthe capacity of boring himself to a perfectly unlimited extent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence divined, from some indefinable constraint and anxiety in this\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s manner\xe2\x80\x94which was always a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, in spite of the\r\nharmless little eccentricities that attached to it\xe2\x80\x94and from Walter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner no less, that something more immediately tending to some object\r\nwas to follow this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been mentioning to my friend Mr Gay, if I may be allowed to\r\nhave the honour of calling him so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\r\nrejoiced to hear that my friend Dombey is very decidedly mending. I\r\ntrust my friend Dombey will not allow his mind to be too much preyed\r\nupon, by any mere loss of fortune. I cannot say that I have ever\r\nexperienced any very great loss of fortune myself: never having had, in\r\npoint of fact, any great amount of fortune to lose. But as much as I\r\ncould lose, I have lost; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t find that I particularly care\r\nabout it. I know my friend Dombey to be a devilish honourable man; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s calculated to console my friend Dombey very much, to know, that\r\nthis is the universal sentiment. Even Tommy Screwzer,\xe2\x80\x94a man of an\r\nextremely bilious habit, with whom my friend Gay is probably\r\nacquainted\xe2\x80\x94cannot say a syllable in disputation of the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlorence felt, more than ever, that there was something to come; and\r\nlooked earnestly for it. So earnestly, that Cousin Feenix answered, as\r\nif she had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my friend Gay and myself have\r\nbeen discussing the propriety of entreating a favour at your hands; and\r\nthat I have the consent of my friend Gay\xe2\x80\x94who has met me in an\r\nexceedingly kind and open manner, for which I am very much indebted to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94to solicit it. I am sensible that so amiable a lady as the lovely\r\nand accomplished daughter of my friend Dombey will not require much\r\nurging; but I am happy to know, that I am supported by my friend Gay\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence and approval. As in my parliamentary time, when a man had a\r\nmotion to make of any sort\xe2\x80\x94which happened seldom in those days, for we\r\nwere kept very tight in hand, the leaders on both sides being regular\r\nMartinets, which was a devilish good thing for the rank and file, like\r\nmyself, and prevented our exposing ourselves continually, as a great\r\nmany of us had a feverish anxiety to do\xe2\x80\x94as, in my parliamentary time, I\r\nwas about to say, when a man had leave to let off any little private\r\npopgun, it was always considered a great point for him to say that he\r\nhad the happiness of believing that his sentiments were not without an\r\necho in the breast of Mr Pitt; the pilot, in point of fact, who had\r\nweathered the storm. Upon which, a devilish large number of fellows\r\nimmediately cheered, and put him in spirits. Though the fact is, that\r\nthese fellows, being under orders to cheer most excessively whenever Mr\r\nPitt\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned, became so proficient that it always woke\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. And they were so entirely innocent of what was going on,\r\notherwise, that it used to be commonly said by Conversation\r\nBrown\xe2\x80\x94four-bottle man at the Treasury Board, with whom the father of my\r\nfriend Gay was probably acquainted, for it was before my friend Gay\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94that if a man had risen in his place, and said that he regretted\r\nto inform the house that there was an Honourable Member in the last\r\nstage of convulsions in the Lobby, and that the Honourable Member\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was Pitt, the approbation would have been vociferous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis postponement of the point, put Florence in a flutter; and she\r\nlooked from Cousin Feenix to Walter, in increasing agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walter, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing the matter, upon my honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI am deeply distressed at being the means of causing you a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuneasiness. I beg to assure you that there is nothing the matter. The\r\nfavour that I have to ask is, simply\xe2\x80\x94but it really does seem so\r\nexceedingly singular, that I should be in the last degree obliged to my\r\nfriend Gay if he would have the goodness to break the\xe2\x80\x94in point of fact,\r\nthe ice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix.\r\n\r\nWalter thus appealed to, and appealed to no less in the look that\r\nFlorence turned towards him, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest, it is no more than this. That you will ride to London with\r\nthis gentleman, whom you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my friend Gay, also\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Cousin Feenix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And with me\xe2\x80\x94and make a visit somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I might entreat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would not press for\r\nan answer to that question, I would venture to take the liberty of\r\nmaking the request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd think it right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Only because I am sure that you would too. Though there may be\r\nreasons I very well understand, which make it better that nothing more\r\nshould be said beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Papa is still asleep, or can spare me if he is awake, I will go\r\nimmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. And rising quietly, and glancing at them\r\nwith a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding, left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back, ready to bear them company, they were talking\r\ntogether, gravely, at the window; and Florence could not but wonder\r\nwhat the topic was, that had made them so well acquainted in so short a\r\ntime. She did not wonder at the look of pride and love with which her\r\nhusband broke off as she entered; for she never saw him, but that\r\nrested on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, \xe2\x80\x9ca card for my friend Dombey,\r\nsincerely trusting that he will pick up health and strength with every\r\nreturning hour. And I hope my friend Dombey will do me the favour to\r\nconsider me a man who has a devilish warm admiration of his character,\r\nas, in point of fact, a British merchant and a devilish upright\r\ngentleman. My place in the country is in a most confounded state of\r\ndilapidation, but if my friend Dombey should require a change of air,\r\nand would take up his quarters there, he would find it a remarkably\r\nhealthy spot\xe2\x80\x94as it need be, for it\xe2\x80\x99s amazingly dull. If my friend\r\nDombey suffers from bodily weakness, and would allow me to recommend\r\nwhat has frequently done myself good, as a man who has been extremely\r\nqueer at times, and who lived pretty freely in the days when men lived\r\nvery freely, I should say, let it be in point of fact the yolk of an\r\negg, beat up with sugar and nutmeg, in a glass of sherry, and taken in\r\nthe morning with a slice of dry toast. Jackson, who kept the\r\nboxing-rooms in Bond Street\xe2\x80\x94man of very superior qualifications, with\r\nwhose reputation my friend Gay is no doubt acquainted\xe2\x80\x94used to mention\r\nthat in training for the ring they substituted rum for sherry. I should\r\nrecommend sherry in this case, on account of my friend Dombey being in\r\nan invalided condition; which might occasion rum to fly\xe2\x80\x94in point of\r\nfact to his head\xe2\x80\x94and throw him into a devil of a state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf all this, Cousin Feenix delivered himself with an obviously nervous\r\nand discomposed air. Then, giving his arm to Florence, and putting the\r\nstrongest possible constraint upon his wilful legs, which seemed\r\ndetermined to go out into the garden, he led her to the door, and\r\nhanded her into a carriage that was ready for her reception.\r\n\r\nWalter entered after him, and they drove away.\r\n\r\nTheir ride was six or eight miles long. When they drove through certain\r\ndull and stately streets, lying westward in London, it was growing\r\ndusk. Florence had, by this time, put her hand in Walter\xe2\x80\x99s; and was\r\nlooking very earnestly, and with increasing agitation, into every new\r\nstreet into which they turned.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage stopped, at last, before that house in Brook Street,\r\nwhere her father\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy marriage had been celebrated, Florence said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter, what is this? Who is here?\xe2\x80\x9d Walter cheering her, and not\r\nreplying, she glanced up at the house-front, and saw that all the\r\nwindows were shut, as if it were uninhabited. Cousin Feenix had by this\r\ntime alighted, and was offering his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not coming, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will remain here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tremble there is nothing to fear,\r\ndearest Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, Walter, with you so near. I am sure of that, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was softly opened, without any knock, and Cousin Feenix led\r\nher out of the summer evening air into the close dull house. More\r\nsombre and brown than ever, it seemed to have been shut up from the\r\nwedding-day, and to have hoarded darkness and sadness ever since.\r\n\r\nFlorence ascended the dusky staircase, trembling; and stopped, with her\r\nconductor, at the drawing-room door. He opened it, without speaking,\r\nand signed an entreaty to her to advance into the inner room, while he\r\nremained there. Florence, after hesitating an instant, complied.\r\n\r\nSitting by the window at a table, where she seemed to have been writing\r\nor drawing, was a lady, whose head, turned away towards the dying\r\nlight, was resting on her hand. Florence advancing, doubtfully, all at\r\nonce stood still, as if she had lost the power of motion. The lady\r\nturned her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, shrinking back as she rose up and putting out\r\nher hands to keep her off. \xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood looking at each other. Passion and pride had worn it, but it\r\nwas the face of Edith, and beautiful and stately yet. It was the face\r\nof Florence, and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed,\r\nthere was pity in it, sorrow, a grateful tender memory. On each face,\r\nwonder and fear were painted vividly; each so still and silent, looking\r\nat the other over the black gulf of the irrevocable past.\r\n\r\nFlorence was the first to change. Bursting into tears, she said from\r\nher full heart, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mama, Mama! why do we meet like this? Why were you\r\never kind to me when there was no one else, that we should meet like\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith stood before her, dumb and motionless. Her eyes were fixed upon\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come from Papa\xe2\x80\x99s sick\r\nbed. We are never asunder now; we never shall be\xe2\x80\x9d any more. If you\r\nwould have me ask his pardon, I will do it, Mama. I am almost sure he\r\nwill grant it now, if I ask him. May Heaven grant it to you, too, and\r\ncomfort you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered not a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter\xe2\x80\x94I am married to him, and we have a son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence,\r\ntimidly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis at the door, and has brought me here. I will tell him that\r\nyou are repentant; that you are changed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, looking\r\nmournfully upon her; \xe2\x80\x9cand he will speak to Papa with me, I know. Is\r\nthere anything but this that I can do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, breaking her silence, without moving eye or limb, answered\r\nslowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stain upon your name, upon your husband\xe2\x80\x99s, on your child\xe2\x80\x99s. Will\r\nthat ever be forgiven, Florence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it ever be, Mama? It is! Freely, freely, both by Walter and by\r\nme. If that is any consolation to you, there is nothing that you may\r\nbelieve more certainly. You do not\xe2\x80\x94you do not,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Florence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspeak of Papa; but I am sure you wish that I should ask him for his\r\nforgiveness. I am sure you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered not a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cI will bring it you, if you will let me; and\r\nthen, perhaps, we may take leave of each other, more like what we used\r\nto be to one another. I have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence very gently, and\r\ndrawing nearer to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not shrunk back from you, Mama, because\r\nI fear you, or because I dread to be disgraced by you. I only wish to\r\ndo my duty to Papa. I am very dear to him, and he is very dear to me.\r\nBut I never can forget that you were very good to me. Oh, pray to\r\nHeaven,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence, falling on her bosom, \xe2\x80\x9cpray to Heaven, Mama,\r\nto forgive you all this sin and shame, and to forgive me if I cannot\r\nhelp doing this (if it is wrong), when I remember what you used to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, as if she fell beneath her touch, sunk down on her knees, and\r\ncaught her round the neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMy better angel! Before I am mad again, before\r\nmy stubbornness comes back and strikes me dumb, believe me, upon my\r\nsoul I am innocent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty of much! Guilty of that which sets a waste between us evermore.\r\nGuilty of what must separate me, through the whole remainder of my\r\nlife, from purity and innocence\xe2\x80\x94from you, of all the earth. Guilty of a\r\nblind and passionate resentment, of which I do not, cannot, will not,\r\neven now, repent; but not guilty with that dead man. Before God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon her knees upon the ground, she held up both her hands, and swore\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorence!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cpurest and best of natures,\xe2\x80\x94whom I love\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nmight have changed me long ago, and did for a time work some change\r\neven in the woman that I am,\xe2\x80\x94believe me, I am innocent of that; and\r\nonce more, on my desolate heart, let me lay this dear head, for the\r\nlast time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was moved and weeping. Had she been oftener thus in older days, she\r\nhad been happier now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing else in all the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat would have\r\nwrung denial from me. No love, no hatred, no hope, no threat. I said\r\nthat I would die, and make no sign. I could have done so, and I would,\r\nif we had never met, Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, ambling in at the door, and speaking,\r\nhalf in the room, and half out of it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my lovely and accomplished\r\nrelative will excuse my having, by a little stratagem, effected this\r\nmeeting. I cannot say that I was, at first, wholly incredulous as to\r\nthe possibility of my lovely and accomplished relative having, very\r\nunfortunately, committed herself with the deceased person with white\r\nteeth; because in point of fact, one does see, in this world\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\nremarkable for devilish strange arrangements, and for being decidedly\r\nthe most unintelligible thing within a man\xe2\x80\x99s experience\xe2\x80\x94very odd\r\nconjunctions of that sort. But as I mentioned to my friend Dombey, I\r\ncould not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative\r\nuntil it was perfectly established. And feeling, when the deceased\r\nperson was, in point of fact, destroyed in a devilish horrible manner,\r\nthat her position was a very painful one\xe2\x80\x94and feeling besides that our\r\nfamily had been a little to blame in not paying more attention to her,\r\nand that we are a careless family\xe2\x80\x94and also that my aunt, though a\r\ndevilish lively woman, had perhaps not been the very best of mothers\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ntook the liberty of seeking her in France, and offering her such\r\nprotection as a man very much out at elbows could offer. Upon which\r\noccasion, my lovely and accomplished relative did me the honour to\r\nexpress that she believed I was, in my way, a devilish good sort of\r\nfellow; and that therefore she put herself under my protection. Which\r\nin point of fact I understood to be a kind thing on the part of my\r\nlovely and accomplished relative, as I am getting extremely shaky, and\r\nhave derived great comfort from her solicitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith, who had taken Florence to a sofa, made a gesture with her hand\r\nas if she would have begged him to say no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lovely and accomplished relative,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Cousin Feenix, still\r\nambling about at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cwill excuse me, if, for her satisfaction,\r\nand my own, and that of my friend Dombey, whose lovely and accomplished\r\ndaughter we so much admire, I complete the thread of my observations.\r\nShe will remember that, from the first, she and I never alluded to the\r\nsubject of her elopement. My impression, certainly, has always been,\r\nthat there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so\r\ninclined. But my lovely and accomplished relative being a devilish\r\nresolute woman, I knew that she was not, in point of fact, to be\r\ntrifled with, and therefore did not involve myself in any discussions.\r\nBut, observing lately, that her accessible point did appear to be a\r\nvery strong description of tenderness for the daughter of my friend\r\nDombey, it occurred to me that if I could bring about a meeting,\r\nunexpected on both sides, it might lead to beneficial results.\r\nTherefore, we being in London, in the present private way, before going\r\nto the South of Italy, there to establish ourselves, in point of fact,\r\nuntil we go to our long homes, which is a devilish disagreeable\r\nreflection for a man, I applied myself to the discovery of the\r\nresidence of my friend Gay\xe2\x80\x94handsome man of an uncommonly frank\r\ndisposition, who is probably known to my lovely and accomplished\r\nrelative\xe2\x80\x94and had the happiness of bringing his amiable wife to the\r\npresent place. And now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, with a real and genuine\r\nearnestness shining through the levity of his manner and his slipshod\r\nspeech, \xe2\x80\x9cI do conjure my relative, not to stop half way, but to set\r\nright, as far as she can, whatever she has done wrong\xe2\x80\x94not for the\r\nhonour of her family, not for her own fame, not for any of those\r\nconsiderations which unfortunate circumstances have induced her to\r\nregard as hollow, and in point of fact, as approaching to humbug\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nbecause it is wrong, and not right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix\xe2\x80\x99s legs consented to take him away after this; and leaving\r\nthem alone together, he shut the door.\r\n\r\nEdith remained silent for some minutes, with Florence sitting close\r\nbeside her. Then she took from her bosom a sealed paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI debated with myself a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\r\nto write this at all, in case of dying suddenly or by accident, and\r\nfeeling the want of it upon me. I have deliberated, ever since, when\r\nand how to destroy it. Take it, Florence. The truth is written in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for whom you will,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is given to you, and is\r\nobtained by you. He never could have had it otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they sat silent, in the deepening darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMama,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9che has lost his fortune; he has been at the\r\npoint of death; he may not recover, even now. Is there any word that I\r\nshall say to him from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were very dear to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, in a thrilling voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I am sorry that we ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more?\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him, if he asks, that I do not repent of what I have done\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94for if it were to do again to-morrow, I should do it. But if he is\r\na changed man\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped. There was something in the silent touch of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nthat stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94But that being a changed man, he knows, now, it would never be. Tell\r\nhim I wish it never had been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you grieved to hear of the\r\nafflictions he has suffered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif they have taught him that his daughter is very\r\ndear to him. He will not grieve for them himself, one day, if they have\r\nbrought that lesson, Florence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish well to him, and would have him happy. I am sure you would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! let me be able, if I have the occasion at some\r\nfuture time, to say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith sat with her dark eyes gazing steadfastly before her, and did not\r\nreply until Florence had repeated her entreaty; when she drew her hand\r\nwithin her arm, and said, with the same thoughtful gaze upon the night\r\noutside:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him that if, in his own present, he can find any reason to\r\ncompassionate my past, I sent word that I asked him to do so. Tell him\r\nthat if, in his own present, he can find a reason to think less\r\nbitterly of me, I asked him to do so. Tell him, that, dead as we are to\r\none another, never more to meet on this side of eternity, he knows\r\nthere is one feeling in common between us now, that there never was\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sternness seemed to yield, and there were tears in her dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust myself to that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor his better thoughts of me, and\r\nmine of him. When he loves his Florence most, he will hate me least.\r\nWhen he is most proud and happy in her and her children, he will be\r\nmost repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life.\r\nAt that time, I will be repentant too\xe2\x80\x94let him know it then\xe2\x80\x94and think\r\nthat when I thought so much of all the causes that had made me what I\r\nwas, I needed to have allowed more for the causes that had made him\r\nwhat he was. I will try, then, to forgive him his share of blame. Let\r\nhim try to forgive me mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d said Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cHow it lightens my heart, even in such a\r\nstrange meeting and parting, to hear this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange words in my own ears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cand foreign to the sound\r\nof my own voice! But even if I had been the wretched creature I have\r\ngiven him occasion to believe me, I think I could have said them still,\r\nhearing that you and he were very dear to one another. Let him, when\r\nyou are dearest, ever feel that he is most forbearing in his thoughts\r\nof me\xe2\x80\x94that I am most forbearing in my thoughts of him! Those are the\r\nlast words I send him! Now, goodbye, my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped her in her arms, and seemed to pour out all her woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul of love and tenderness at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis kiss for your child! These kisses for a blessing on your head! My\r\nown dear Florence, my sweet girl, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Florence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again! Never again! When you leave me in this dark room, think\r\nthat you have left me in the grave. Remember only that I was once, and\r\nthat I loved you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Florence left her, seeing her face no more, but accompanied by her\r\nembraces and caresses to the last.\r\n\r\nCousin Feenix met her at the door, and took her down to Walter in the\r\ndingy dining room, upon whose shoulder she laid her head weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am devilish sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Feenix, lifting his wristbands to\r\nhis eyes in the simplest manner possible, and without the least\r\nconcealment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend\r\nDombey and amiable wife of my friend Gay, should have had her sensitive\r\nnature so very much distressed and cut up by the interview which is\r\njust concluded. But I hope and trust I have acted for the best, and\r\nthat my honourable friend Dombey will find his mind relieved by the\r\ndisclosures which have taken place. I exceedingly lament that my friend\r\nDombey should have got himself, in point of fact, into the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nstate of conglomeration by an alliance with our family; but am strongly\r\nof opinion that if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the infernal scoundrel Barker\xe2\x80\x94man\r\nwith white teeth\xe2\x80\x94everything would have gone on pretty smoothly. In\r\nregard to my relative who does me the honour to have formed an\r\nuncommonly good opinion of myself, I can assure the amiable wife of my\r\nfriend Gay, that she may rely on my being, in point of fact, a father\r\nto her. And in regard to the changes of human life, and the\r\nextraordinary manner in which we are perpetually conducting ourselves,\r\nall I can say is, with my friend Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x94man who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for an age\r\nbut for all time, and with whom my friend Gay is no doubt\r\nacquainted\xe2\x80\x94that its like the shadow of a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nFinal\r\n\r\n\r\nA bottle that has been long excluded from the light of day, and is\r\nhoary with dust and cobwebs, has been brought into the sunshine; and\r\nthe golden wine within it sheds a lustre on the table.\r\n\r\nIt is the last bottle of the old Madiera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, Mr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very rare\r\nand most delicious wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who is of the party, beams with joy. There is a very halo\r\nof delight round his glowing forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe always promised ourselves, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Mr Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d Ned and\r\nmyself, I mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Dombey nods at the Captain, who shines more and more with speechless\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94that we would drink this, one day or other, to Walter safe at home:\r\nthough such a home we never thought of. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t object to our old\r\nwhim, Sir, let us devote this first glass to Walter and his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Walter and his wife!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Dombey. \xe2\x80\x9cFlorence, my child\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nturns to kiss her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Walter and his wife!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Wal\xe2\x80\x9dr and his wife!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaims the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nCaptain exhibiting a strong desire to clink his glass against some\r\nother glass, Mr Dombey, with a ready hand, holds out his. The others\r\nfollow; and there is a blithe and merry ringing, as of a little peal of\r\nmarriage bells.\r\n\r\nOther buried wine grows older, as the old Madeira did in its time; and\r\ndust and cobwebs thicken on the bottles.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey is a white-haired gentleman, whose face bears heavy marks of\r\ncare and suffering; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on\r\nfor ever, and left a clear evening in its track.\r\n\r\nAmbitious projects trouble him no more. His only pride is in his\r\ndaughter and her husband. He has a silent, thoughtful, quiet manner,\r\nand is always with his daughter. Miss Tox is not infrequently of the\r\nfamily party, and is quite devoted to it, and a great favourite. Her\r\nadmiration of her once stately patron is, and has been ever since the\r\nmorning of her shock in Princess\xe2\x80\x99s Place, platonic, but not weakened in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nNothing has drifted to him from the wreck of his fortunes, but a\r\ncertain annual sum that comes he knows not how, with an earnest\r\nentreaty that he will not seek to discover, and with the assurance that\r\nit is a debt, and an act of reparation. He has consulted with his old\r\nclerk about this, who is clear it may be honourably accepted, and has\r\nno doubt it arises out of some forgotten transaction in the times of\r\nthe old House.\r\n\r\nThat hazel-eyed bachelor, a bachelor no more, is married now, and to\r\nthe sister of the grey-haired Junior. He visits his old chief\r\nsometimes, but seldom. There is a reason in the greyhaired Junior\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory, and yet a stronger reason in his name, why he should keep\r\nretired from his old employer; and as he lives with his sister and her\r\nhusband, they participate in that retirement. Walter sees them\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94Florence too\xe2\x80\x94and the pleasant house resounds with profound\r\nduets arranged for the Piano-Forte and Violoncello, and with the\r\nlabours of Harmonious Blacksmiths.\r\n\r\nAnd how goes the wooden Midshipman in these changed days? Why, here he\r\nstill is, right leg foremost, hard at work upon the hackney coaches,\r\nand more on the alert than ever, being newly painted from his cocked\r\nhat to his buckled shoes; and up above him, in golden characters, these\r\nnames shine refulgent, GILLS AND CUTTLE.\r\n\r\nNot another stroke of business does the Midshipman achieve beyond his\r\nusual easy trade. But they do say, in a circuit of some half-mile round\r\nthe blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market, that some of Mr Gills\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\ninvestments are coming out wonderfully well; and that instead of being\r\nbehind the time in those respects, as he supposed, he was, in truth, a\r\nlittle before it, and had to wait the fulness of the time and the\r\ndesign. The whisper is that Mr Gills\xe2\x80\x99s money has begun to turn itself,\r\nand that it is turning itself over and over pretty briskly. Certain it\r\nis that, standing at his shop-door, in his coffee-coloured suit, with\r\nhis chronometer in his pocket, and his spectacles on his forehead, he\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t appear to break his heart at customers not coming, but looks very\r\njovial and contented, though full as misty as of yore.\r\n\r\nAs to his partner, Captain Cuttle, there is a fiction of a business in\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind which is better than any reality. The Captain is as\r\nsatisfied of the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s importance to the commerce and navigation\r\nof the country, as he could possibly be, if no ship left the Port of\r\nLondon without the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s assistance. His delight in his own name\r\nover the door, is inexhaustible. He crosses the street, twenty times a\r\nday, to look at it from the other side of the way; and invariably says,\r\non these occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cEd\xe2\x80\x99ard Cuttle, my lad, if your mother could ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99d as you would ever be a man o\xe2\x80\x99 science, the good old creetur\r\nwould ha\xe2\x80\x99 been took aback in-deed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut here is Mr Toots descending on the Midshipman with violent\r\nrapidity, and Mr Toots\xe2\x80\x99s face is very red as he bursts into the little\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr Sols, I am happy to inform you\r\nthat Mrs Toots has had an increase to her family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it does her credit!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you joy, Mr Toots!\xe2\x80\x9d says old Sol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckles Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you. I knew\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to hear, and so I came down myself. We\xe2\x80\x99re positively\r\ngetting on, you know. There\xe2\x80\x99s Florence, and Susan, and now here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother little stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA female stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d inquires the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it. The oftener\r\nwe can repeat that most extraordinary woman, my opinion is, the\r\nbetter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, turning to the old case-bottle with no\r\nthroat\xe2\x80\x94for it is evening, and the Midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s usual moderate provision\r\nof pipes and glasses is on the board. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to her, and may she have\r\never so many more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d says the delighted Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cI echo the\r\nsentiment. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, as my so doing cannot be unpleasant to\r\nanybody, under the circumstances, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots begins to smoke, accordingly, and in the openness of his heart\r\nis very loquacious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the remarkable instances that that delightful woman has given\r\nof her excellent sense, Captain Gills and Mr Sols,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink none is more remarkable than the perfection with which she has\r\nunderstood my devotion to Miss Dombey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth his auditors assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you know,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never changed my sentiments\r\ntowards Miss Dombey. They are the same as ever. She is the same bright\r\nvision to me, at present, that she was before I made Walters\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance. When Mrs Toots and myself first began to talk of\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nshort, of the tender passion, you know, Captain Gills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cas makes us all slue round\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwhich you\xe2\x80\x99ll overhaul the book\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly do so, Captain Gills,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots, with great\r\nearnestness; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we first began to mention such subjects, I explained\r\nthat I was what you may call a Blighted Flower, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain approves of this figure greatly; and murmurs that no flower\r\nas blows, is like the rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Lord bless me,\xe2\x80\x9d pursues Mr Toots, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was as entirely conscious\r\nof the state of my feelings as I was myself. There was nothing I could\r\ntell her. She was the only person who could have stood between me and\r\nthe silent Tomb, and she did it, in a manner to command my everlasting\r\nadmiration. She knows that there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody in the world I look up to, as\r\nI do to Miss Dombey. Knows that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on earth I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nfor Miss Dombey. She knows that I consider Miss Dombey the most\r\nbeautiful, the most amiable, the most angelic of her sex. What is her\r\nobservation upon that? The perfection of sense. \xe2\x80\x98My dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\r\nI think so too.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sol Gills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumes Mr Toots, after some contemplative pulling at his pipe,\r\nduring which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat an observant woman my wife is! What sagacity she possesses! What\r\nremarks she makes! It was only last night, when we were sitting in the\r\nenjoyment of connubial bliss\xe2\x80\x94which, upon my word and honour, is a\r\nfeeble term to express my feelings in the society of my wife\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nsaid how remarkable it was to consider the present position of our\r\nfriend Walters. \xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 observes my wife, \xe2\x80\x98he is, released from\r\nsea-going, after that first long voyage with his young bride\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as you\r\nknow he was, Mr Sols.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old Instrument-maker, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Here he is,\xe2\x80\x99 says my wife, \xe2\x80\x98released from that, immediately;\r\nappointed by the same establishment to a post of great trust and\r\nconfidence at home; showing himself again worthy; mounting up the\r\nladder with the greatest expedition; beloved by everybody; assisted by\r\nhis uncle at the very best possible time of his fortunes\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94which I think\r\nis the case, Mr Sols? My wife is always correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes, yes\xe2\x80\x94some of our lost ships, freighted with gold, have come\r\nhome, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d returns old Sol, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cSmall craft, Mr Toots, but\r\nserviceable to my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never find my wife wrong. \xe2\x80\x98Here he\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x99 says that most remarkable woman, \xe2\x80\x98so situated,\xe2\x80\x94and what follows?\r\nWhat follows?\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mrs Toots. Now pray remark, Captain Gills, and\r\nMr Sols, the depth of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s penetration. \xe2\x80\x98Why that, under the very\r\neye of Mr Dombey, there is a foundation going on, upon which a\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nEdifice;\xe2\x80\x99 that was Mrs Toots\xe2\x80\x99s word,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Toots exultingly, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cis\r\ngradually rising, perhaps to equal, perhaps excel, that of which he was\r\nonce the head, and the small beginnings of which (a common fault, but a\r\nbad one, Mrs Toots said) escaped his memory. Thus,\xe2\x80\x99 said my wife, \xe2\x80\x98from\r\nhis daughter, after all, another Dombey and Son will ascend\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94no \xe2\x80\x98rise;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat was Mrs Toots\xe2\x80\x99s word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98triumphant!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Toots, with the assistance of his pipe\xe2\x80\x94which he is extremely glad to\r\ndevote to oratorical purposes, as its proper use affects him with a\r\nvery uncomfortable sensation\xe2\x80\x94does such grand justice to this prophetic\r\nsentence of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s, that the Captain, throwing away his glazed hat\r\nin a state of the greatest excitement, cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSol Gills, you man of science and my ould pardner, what did I tell\r\nWal\xe2\x80\x9dr to overhaul on that there night when he first took to business?\r\nWas it this here quotation, \xe2\x80\x98Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon, and when you are old you will never depart from it.\xe2\x80\x99 Was it\r\nthem words, Sol Gills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly was, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old Instrument-maker. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, leaning back in his chair,\r\nand composing his chest for a prodigious roar. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you Lovely\r\nPeg right through; and stand by, both on you, for the chorus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuried wine grows older, as the old Madeira did, in its time; and dust\r\nand cobwebs thicken on the bottles.\r\n\r\nAutumn days are shining, and on the sea-beach there are often a young\r\nlady, and a white-haired gentleman. With them, or near them, are two\r\nchildren: boy and girl. And an old dog is generally in their company.\r\n\r\nThe white-haired gentleman walks with the little boy, talks with him,\r\nhelps him in his play, attends upon him, watches him as if he were the\r\nobject of his life. If he be thoughtful, the white-haired gentleman is\r\nthoughtful too; and sometimes when the child is sitting by his side,\r\nand looks up in his face, asking him questions, he takes the tiny hand\r\nin his, and holding it, forgets to answer. Then the child says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, grandpa! Am I so like my poor little Uncle again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Paul. But he was weak, and you are very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I am very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he lay on a little bed beside the sea, and you can run about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they range away again, busily, for the white-haired gentleman\r\nlikes best to see the child free and stirring; and as they go about\r\ntogether, the story of the bond between them goes about, and follows\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut no one, except Florence, knows the measure of the white-haired\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s affection for the girl. That story never goes about. The\r\nchild herself almost wonders at a certain secrecy he keeps in it. He\r\nhoards her in his heart. He cannot bear to see a cloud upon her face.\r\nHe cannot bear to see her sit apart. He fancies that she feels a\r\nslight, when there is none. He steals away to look at her, in her\r\nsleep. It pleases him to have her come, and wake him in the morning. He\r\nis fondest of her and most loving to her, when there is no creature by.\r\nThe child says then, sometimes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear grandpapa, why do you cry when you kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only answers, \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Florence! little Florence!\xe2\x80\x9d and smooths away\r\nthe curls that shade her earnest eyes.\r\n\r\nThe voices in the waves speak low to him of Florence, day and\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94plainest when he, his blooming daughter, and her husband, beside\r\nthem in the evening, or sit at an open window, listening to their roar.\r\nThey speak to him of Florence and his altered heart; of Florence and\r\ntheir ceaseless murmuring to her of the love, eternal and illimitable,\r\nextending still, beyond the sea, beyond the sky, to the invisible\r\ncountry far away.\r\n\r\nNever from the mighty sea may voices rise too late, to come between us\r\nand the unseen region on the other shore! Better, far better, that they\r\nwhispered of that region in our childish ears, and the swift river\r\nhurried us away!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE OF 1848\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot forego my usual opportunity of saying farewell to my readers\r\nin this greeting-place, though I have only to acknowledge the unbounded\r\nwarmth and earnestness of their sympathy in every stage of the journey\r\nwe have just concluded.\r\n\r\nIf any of them have felt a sorrow in one of the principal incidents on\r\nwhich this fiction turns, I hope it may be a sorrow of that sort which\r\nendears the sharers in it, one to another. This is not unselfish in me.\r\nI may claim to have felt it, at least as much as anybody else; and I\r\nwould fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience.\r\n\r\nDEVONSHIRE TERRACE, Twenty-Fourth March, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE OF 1867\r\n\r\n\r\nI make so bold as to believe that the faculty (or the habit) of\r\ncorrectly observing the characters of men, is a rare one. I have not\r\neven found, within my experience, that the faculty (or the habit) of\r\ncorrectly observing so much as the faces of men, is a general one by\r\nany means. The two commonest mistakes in judgement that I suppose to\r\narise from the former default, are, the confounding of shyness with\r\narrogance\xe2\x80\x94a very common mistake indeed\xe2\x80\x94and the not understanding that\r\nan obstinate nature exists in a perpetual struggle with itself.\r\n\r\nMr Dombey undergoes no violent change, either in this book, or in real\r\nlife. A sense of his injustice is within him, all along. The more he\r\nrepresses it, the more unjust he necessarily is. Internal shame and\r\nexternal circumstances may bring the contest to a close in a week, or a\r\nday; but, it has been a contest for years, and is only fought out after\r\na long balance of victory.\r\n\r\nI began this book by the Lake of Geneva, and went on with it for some\r\nmonths in France, before pursuing it in England. The association\r\nbetween the writing and the place of writing is so curiously strong in\r\nmy mind, that at this day, although I know, in my fancy, every stair in\r\nthe little midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s house, and could swear to every pew in the\r\nchurch in which Florence was married, or to every young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedstead in Doctor Blimber\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, I yet confusedly imagine\r\nCaptain Cuttle as secluding himself from Mrs MacStinger among the\r\nmountains of Switzerland. Similarly, when I am reminded by any chance\r\nof what it was that the waves were always saying, my remembrance\r\nwanders for a whole winter night about the streets of Paris\xe2\x80\x94as I\r\nrestlessly did with a heavy heart, on the night when I had written the\r\nchapter in which my little friend and I parted company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOMBEY AND SON ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
