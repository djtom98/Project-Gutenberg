Like the ominous calm which precedes some more than usually\r\nterrific outbreak of the elements, they seem to have paused even in\r\ntheir ordinary fluctuations, to gather a terrific strength for the great\r\neffort. A faint peal of thunder now comes from far off. Like a signal\r\ngun for the battle of the winds to begin, it appeared to awaken them\r\nfrom their lethargy, and one awful, warring hurricane swept over a whole\r\ncity, producing more devastation in the four or five minutes it lasted,\r\nthan would a half century of ordinary phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt was as if some giant had blown upon some toy town, and scattered many\r\nof the buildings before the hot blast of his terrific breath; for as\r\nsuddenly as that blast of wind had come did it cease, and all was as\r\nstill and calm as before.\r\n\r\nSleepers awakened, and thought that what they had heard must be the\r\nconfused chimera of a dream. They trembled and turned to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAll is still--still as the very grave. Not a sound breaks the magic of\r\nrepose. What is that--a strange, pattering noise, as of a million of\r\nfairy feet? It is hail--yes, a hail-storm has burst over the city.\r\nLeaves are dashed from the trees, mingled with small boughs; windows\r\nthat lie most opposed to the direct fury of the pelting particles of ice\r\nare broken, and the rapt repose that before was so remarkable in its\r\nintensity, is exchanged for a noise which, in its accumulation, drowns\r\nevery cry of surprise or consternation which here and there arose from\r\npersons who found their houses invaded by the storm.\r\n\r\nNow and then, too, there would come a sudden gust of wind that in its\r\nstrength, as it blew laterally, would, for a moment, hold millions of\r\nthe hailstones suspended in mid air, but it was only to dash them with\r\nredoubled force in some new direction, where more mischief was to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nOh, how the storm raged! Hail--rain--wind. It was, in very truth, an\r\nawful night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is an antique chamber in an ancient house. Curious and quaint\r\ncarvings adorn the walls, and the large chimney-piece is a curiosity of\r\nitself. The ceiling is low, and a large bay window, from roof to floor,\r\nlooks to the west. The window is latticed, and filled with curiously\r\npainted glass and rich stained pieces, which send in a strange, yet\r\nbeautiful light, when sun or moon shines into the apartment. There is\r\nbut one portrait in that room, although the walls seem panelled for the\r\nexpress purpose of containing a series of pictures. That portrait is of\r\na young man, with a pale face, a stately brow, and a strange expression\r\nabout the eyes, which no one cared to look on twice.\r\n\r\nThere is a stately bed in that chamber, of carved walnut-wood is it\r\nmade, rich in design and elaborate in execution; one of those works of\r\nart which owe their existence to the Elizabethan era. It is hung with\r\nheavy silken and damask furnishing; nodding feathers are at its\r\ncorners--covered with dust are they, and they lend a funereal aspect to\r\nthe room. The floor is of polished oak.\r\n\r\nGod! how the hail dashes on the old bay window! Like an occasional\r\ndischarge of mimic musketry, it comes clashing, beating, and cracking\r\nupon the small panes; but they resist it--their small size saves them;\r\nthe wind, the hail, the rain, expend their fury in vain.\r\n\r\nThe bed in that old chamber is occupied. A creature formed in all\r\nfashions of loveliness lies in a half sleep upon that ancient couch--a\r\ngirl young and beautiful as a spring morning. Her long hair has escaped\r\nfrom its confinement and streams over the blackened coverings of the\r\nbedstead; she has been restless in her sleep, for the clothing of the\r\nbed is in much confusion. One arm is over her head, the other hangs\r\nnearly off the side of the bed near to which she lies. A neck and bosom\r\nthat would have formed a study for the rarest sculptor that ever\r\nProvidence gave genius to, were half disclosed. She moaned slightly in\r\nher sleep, and once or twice the lips moved as if in prayer--at least\r\none might judge so, for the name of Him who suffered for all came once\r\nfaintly from them.\r\n\r\nShe has endured much fatigue, and the storm does not awaken her; but it\r\ncan disturb the slumbers it does not possess the power to destroy\r\nentirely. The turmoil of the elements wakes the senses, although it\r\ncannot entirely break the repose they have lapsed into.\r\n\r\nOh, what a world of witchery was in that mouth, slightly parted, and\r\nexhibiting within the pearly teeth that glistened even in the faint\r\nlight that came from that bay window. How sweetly the long silken\r\neyelashes lay upon the cheek. Now she moves, and one shoulder is\r\nentirely visible--whiter, fairer than the spotless clothing of the bed\r\non which she lies, is the smooth skin of that fair creature, just\r\nbudding into womanhood, and in that transition state which presents to\r\nus all the charms of the girl--almost of the child, with the more\r\nmatured beauty and gentleness of advancing years.\r\n\r\nWas that lightning? Yes--an awful, vivid, terrifying flash--then a\r\nroaring peal of thunder, as if a thousand mountains were rolling one\r\nover the other in the blue vault of Heaven! Who sleeps now in that\r\nancient city? Not one living soul. The dread trumpet of eternity could\r\nnot more effectually have awakened any one.\r\n\r\nThe hail continues. The wind continues. The uproar of the elements seems\r\nat its height. Now she awakens--that beautiful girl on the antique bed;\r\nshe opens those eyes of celestial blue, and a faint cry of alarm bursts\r\nfrom her lips. At least it is a cry which, amid the noise and turmoil\r\nwithout, sounds but faint and weak. She sits upon the bed and presses\r\nher hands upon her eyes. Heavens! what a wild torrent of wind, and rain,\r\nand hail! The thunder likewise seems intent upon awakening sufficient\r\nechoes to last until the next flash of forked lightning should again\r\nproduce the wild concussion of the air. She murmurs a prayer--a prayer\r\nfor those she loves best; the names of those dear to her gentle heart\r\ncome from her lips; she weeps and prays; she thinks then of what\r\ndevastation the storm must surely produce, and to the great God of\r\nHeaven she prays for all living things. Another flash--a wild, blue,\r\nbewildering flash of lightning streams across that bay window, for an\r\ninstant bringing out every colour in it with terrible distinctness. A\r\nshriek bursts from the lips of the young girl, and then, with eyes fixed\r\nupon that window, which, in another moment, is all darkness, and with\r\nsuch an expression of terror upon her face as it had never before known,\r\nshe trembled, and the perspiration of intense fear stood upon her brow.\r\n\r\n"What--what was it?" she gasped; "real, or a delusion? Oh, God, what was\r\nit? A figure tall and gaunt, endeavouring from the outside to unclasp\r\nthe window. I saw it. That flash of lightning revealed it to me. It\r\nstood the whole length of the window."\r\n\r\nThere was a lull of the wind. The hail was not falling so\r\nthickly--moreover, it now fell, what there was of it, straight, and yet\r\na strange clattering sound came upon the glass of that long window. It\r\ncould not be a delusion--she is awake, and she hears it. What can\r\nproduce it? Another flash of lightning--another shriek--there could be\r\nnow no delusion.\r\n\r\nA tall figure is standing on the ledge immediately outside the long\r\nwindow. It is its finger-nails upon the glass that produces the sound so\r\nlike the hail, now that the hail has ceased. Intense fear paralysed the\r\nlimbs of that beautiful girl. That one shriek is all she can utter--with\r\nhands clasped, a face of marble, a heart beating so wildly in her bosom,\r\nthat each moment it seems as if it would break its confines, eyes\r\ndistended and fixed upon the window, she waits, froze with horror. The\r\npattering and clattering of the nails continue. No word is spoken, and\r\nnow she fancies she can trace the darker form of that figure against the\r\nwindow, and she can see the long arms moving to and fro, feeling for\r\nsome mode of entrance. What strange light is that which now gradually\r\ncreeps up into the air? red and terrible--brighter and brighter it\r\ngrows. The lightning has set fire to a mill, and the reflection of the\r\nrapidly consuming building falls upon that long window. There can be no\r\nmistake. The figure is there, still feeling for an entrance, and\r\nclattering against the glass with its long nails, that appear as if the\r\ngrowth of many years had been untouched. She tries to scream again but a\r\nchoking sensation comes over her, and she cannot. It is too\r\ndreadful--she tries to move--each limb seems weighed down by tons of\r\nlead--she can but in a hoarse faint whisper cry,--\r\n\r\n"Help--help--help--help!"\r\n\r\nAnd that one word she repeats like a person in a dream. The red glare of\r\nthe fire continues. It throws up the tall gaunt figure in hideous relief\r\nagainst the long window. It shows, too, upon the one portrait that is in\r\nthe chamber, and that portrait appears to fix its eyes upon the\r\nattempting intruder, while the flickering light from the fire makes it\r\nlook fearfully life-like. A small pane of glass is broken, and the form\r\nfrom without introduces a long gaunt hand, which seems utterly destitute\r\nof flesh. The fastening is removed, and one-half of the window, which\r\nopens like folding doors, is swung wide open upon its hinges.\r\n\r\nAnd yet now she could not scream--she could not move.\r\n"Help!--help!--help!" was all she could say. But, oh, that look of\r\nterror that sat upon her face, it was dreadful--a look to haunt the\r\nmemory for a lifetime--a look to obtrude itself upon the happiest\r\nmoments, and turn them to bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe figure turns half round, and the light falls upon the face. It is\r\nperfectly white--perfectly bloodless. The eyes look like polished tin;\r\nthe lips are drawn back, and the principal feature next to those\r\ndreadful eyes is the teeth--the fearful looking teeth--projecting like\r\nthose of some wild animal, hideously, glaringly white, and fang-like. It\r\napproaches the bed with a strange, gliding movement. It clashes together\r\nthe long nails that literally appear to hang from the finger ends. No\r\nsound comes from its lips. Is she going mad--that young and beautiful\r\ngirl exposed to so much terror? she has drawn up all her limbs; she\r\ncannot even now say help. The power of articulation is gone, but the\r\npower of movement has returned to her; she can draw herself slowly along\r\nto the other side of the bed from that towards which the hideous\r\nappearance is coming.\r\n\r\nBut her eyes are fascinated. The glance of a serpent could not have\r\nproduced a greater effect upon her than did the fixed gaze of those\r\nawful, metallic-looking eyes that were bent on her face. Crouching down\r\nso that the gigantic height was lost, and the horrible, protruding,\r\nwhite face was the most prominent object, came on the figure. What was\r\nit?--what did it want there?--what made it look so hideous--so unlike an\r\ninhabitant of the earth, and yet to be on it?\r\n\r\nNow she has got to the verge of the bed, and the figure pauses. It\r\nseemed as if when it paused she lost the power to proceed. The clothing\r\nof the bed was now clutched in her hands with unconscious power. She\r\ndrew her breath short and thick. Her bosom heaves, and her limbs\r\ntremble, yet she cannot withdraw her eyes from that marble-looking face.\r\nHe holds her with his glittering eye.\r\n\r\nThe storm has ceased--all is still. The winds are hushed; the church\r\nclock proclaims the hour of one: a hissing sound comes from the throat\r\nof the hideous being, and he raises his long, gaunt arms--the lips move.\r\nHe advances. The girl places one small foot from the bed on to the\r\nfloor. She is unconsciously dragging the clothing with her. The door of\r\nthe room is in that direction--can she reach it? Has she power to\r\nwalk?--can she withdraw her eyes from the face of the intruder, and so\r\nbreak the hideous charm? God of Heaven! is it real, or some dream so\r\nlike reality as to nearly overturn the judgment for ever?\r\n\r\nThe figure has paused again, and half on the bed and half out of it that\r\nyoung girl lies trembling. Her long hair streams across the entire width\r\nof the bed. As she has slowly moved along she has left it streaming\r\nacross the pillows. The pause lasted about a minute--oh, what an age of\r\nagony. That minute was, indeed, enough for madness to do its full work\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden rush that could not be foreseen--with a strange howling\r\ncry that was enough to awaken terror in every breast, the figure seized\r\nthe long tresses of her hair, and twining them round his bony hands he\r\nheld her to the bed. Then she screamed--Heaven granted her then power to\r\nscream. Shriek followed shriek in rapid succession. The bed-clothes fell\r\nin a heap by the side of the bed--she was dragged by her long silken\r\nhair completely on to it again. Her beautifully rounded limbs quivered\r\nwith the agony of her soul. The glassy, horrible eyes of the figure ran\r\nover that angelic form with a hideous satisfaction--horrible\r\nprofanation. He drags her head to the bed\'s edge. He forces it back by\r\nthe long hair still entwined in his grasp. With a plunge he seizes her\r\nneck in his fang-like teeth--a gush of blood, and a hideous sucking\r\nnoise follows. _The girl has swooned, and the vampyre is at his hideous\r\nrepast!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ALARM.--THE PISTOL SHOT.--THE PURSUIT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLights flashed about the building, and various room doors opened; voices\r\ncalled one to the other. There was an universal stir and commotion among\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear a scream, Harry?" asked a young man, half-dressed, as he\r\nwalked into the chamber of another about his own age.\r\n\r\n"I did--where was it?"\r\n\r\n"God knows. I dressed myself directly."\r\n\r\n"All is still now."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but unless I was dreaming there was a scream."\r\n\r\n"We could not both dream there was. Where did you think it came from?"\r\n\r\n"It burst so suddenly upon my ears that I cannot say."\r\n\r\nThere was a tap now at the door of the room where these young men were,\r\nand a female voice said,--\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, get up!"\r\n\r\n"We are up," said both the young men, appearing.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a scream."\r\n\r\n"Oh, search the house--search the house; where did it come from--can you\r\ntell?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed we cannot, mother."\r\n\r\nAnother person now joined the party. He was a man of middle age, and, as\r\nhe came up to them, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Good God! what is the matter?"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the words passed his lips, than such a rapid succession of\r\nshrieks came upon their ears, that they felt absolutely stunned by them.\r\nThe elderly lady, whom one of the young men had called mother, fainted,\r\nand would have fallen to the floor of the corridor in which they all\r\nstood, had she not been promptly supported by the last comer, who\r\nhimself staggered, as those piercing cries came upon the night air. He,\r\nhowever, was the first to recover, for the young men seemed paralysed.\r\n\r\n"Henry," he cried, "for God\'s sake support your mother. Can you doubt\r\nthat these cries come from Flora\'s room?"\r\n\r\nThe young man mechanically supported his mother, and then the man who\r\nhad just spoken darted back to his own bed-room, from whence he returned\r\nin a moment with a pair of pistols, and shouting,--\r\n\r\n"Follow me, who can!" he bounded across the corridor in the direction of\r\nthe antique apartment, from whence the cries proceeded, but which were\r\nnow hushed.\r\n\r\nThat house was built for strength, and the doors were all of oak, and of\r\nconsiderable thickness. Unhappily, they had fastenings within, so that\r\nwhen the man reached the chamber of her who so much required help, he\r\nwas helpless, for the door was fast.\r\n\r\n"Flora! Flora!" he cried; "Flora, speak!"\r\n\r\nAll was still.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" he added; "we must force the door."\r\n\r\n"I hear a strange noise within," said the young man, who trembled\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"And so do I. What does it sound like?"\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know; but it nearest resembles some animal eating, or\r\nsucking some liquid."\r\n\r\n"What on earth can it be? Have you no weapon that will force the door? I\r\nshall go mad if I am kept here."\r\n\r\n"I have," said the young man. "Wait here a moment."\r\n\r\nHe ran down the staircase, and presently returned with a small, but\r\npowerful, iron crow-bar.\r\n\r\n"This will do," he said.\r\n\r\n"It will, it will.--Give it to me."\r\n\r\n"Has she not spoken?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. My mind misgives me that something very dreadful must have\r\nhappened to her."\r\n\r\n"And that odd noise!"\r\n\r\n"Still goes on. Somehow, it curdles the very blood in my veins to hear\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe man took the crow-bar, and with some difficulty succeeded in\r\nintroducing it between the door and the side of the wall--still it\r\nrequired great strength to move it, but it did move, with a harsh,\r\ncrackling sound.\r\n\r\n"Push it!" cried he who was using the bar, "push the door at the same\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nThe younger man did so. For a few moments the massive door resisted.\r\nThen, suddenly, something gave way with a loud snap--it was a part of\r\nthe lock,--and the door at once swung wide open.\r\n\r\nHow true it is that we measure time by the events which happen within a\r\ngiven space of it, rather than by its actual duration.\r\n\r\nTo those who were engaged in forcing open the door of the antique\r\nchamber, where slept the young girl whom they named Flora, each moment\r\nwas swelled into an hour of agony; but, in reality, from the first\r\nmoment of the alarm to that when the loud cracking noise heralded the\r\ndestruction of the fastenings of the door, there had elapsed but very\r\nfew minutes indeed.\r\n\r\n"It opens--it opens," cried the young man.\r\n\r\n"Another moment," said the stranger, as he still plied the\r\ncrowbar--"another moment, and we shall have free ingress to the chamber.\r\nBe patient."\r\n\r\nThis stranger\'s name was Marchdale; and even as he spoke, he succeeded\r\nin throwing the massive door wide open, and clearing the passage to the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nTo rush in with a light in his hand was the work of a moment to the\r\nyoung man named Henry; but the very rapid progress he made into the\r\napartment prevented him from observing accurately what it contained, for\r\nthe wind that came in from the open window caught the flame of the\r\ncandle, and although it did not actually extinguish it, it blew it so\r\nmuch on one side, that it was comparatively useless as a light.\r\n\r\n"Flora--Flora!" he cried.\r\n\r\nThen with a sudden bound something dashed from off the bed. The\r\nconcussion against him was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, as well\r\nas so tremendously violent, that he was thrown down, and, in his fall,\r\nthe light was fairly extinguished.\r\n\r\nAll was darkness, save a dull, reddish kind of light that now and then,\r\nfrom the nearly consumed mill in the immediate vicinity, came into the\r\nroom. But by that light, dim, uncertain, and flickering as it was, some\r\none was seen to make for the window.\r\n\r\nHenry, although nearly stunned by his fall, saw a figure, gigantic in\r\nheight, which nearly reached from the floor to the ceiling. The other\r\nyoung man, George, saw it, and Mr. Marchdale likewise saw it, as did the\r\nlady who had spoken to the two young men in the corridor when first the\r\nscreams of the young girl awakened alarm in the breasts of all the\r\ninhabitants of that house.\r\n\r\nThe figure was about to pass out at the window which led to a kind of\r\nbalcony, from whence there was an easy descent to a garden.\r\n\r\nBefore it passed out they each and all caught a glance of the side-face,\r\nand they saw that the lower part of it and the lips were dabbled in\r\nblood. They saw, too, one of those fearful-looking, shining, metallic\r\neyes which presented so terrible an appearance of unearthly ferocity.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that for a moment a panic seized them all, which paralysed any\r\nexertions they might otherwise have made to detain that hideous form.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Marchdale was a man of mature years; he had seen much of life,\r\nboth in this and in foreign lands; and he, although astonished to the\r\nextent of being frightened, was much more likely to recover sooner than\r\nhis younger companions, which, indeed, he did, and acted promptly\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t rise, Henry," he cried. "Lie still."\r\n\r\nAlmost at the moment he uttered these words, he fired at the figure,\r\nwhich then occupied the window, as if it were a gigantic figure set in a\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nThe report was tremendous in that chamber, for the pistol was no toy\r\nweapon, but one made for actual service, and of sufficient length and\r\nbore of barrel to carry destruction along with the bullets that came\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n"If that has missed its aim," said Mr. Marchdale, "I\'ll never pull a\r\ntrigger again."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he dashed forward, and made a clutch at the figure he felt\r\nconvinced he had shot.\r\n\r\nThe tall form turned upon him, and when he got a full view of the face,\r\nwhich he did at that moment, from the opportune circumstance of the lady\r\nreturning at the instant with a light she had been to her own chamber to\r\nprocure, even he, Marchdale, with all his courage, and that was great,\r\nand all his nervous energy, recoiled a step or two, and uttered the\r\nexclamation of, "Great God!"\r\n\r\nThat face was one never to be forgotten. It was hideously flushed with\r\ncolour--the colour of fresh blood; the eyes had a savage and remarkable\r\nlustre; whereas, before, they had looked like polished tin--they now\r\nwore a ten times brighter aspect, and flashes of light seemed to dart\r\nfrom them. The mouth was open, as if, from the natural formation of the\r\ncountenance, the lips receded much from the large canine looking teeth.\r\n\r\nA strange howling noise came from the throat of this monstrous figure,\r\nand it seemed upon the point of rushing upon Mr. Marchdale. Suddenly,\r\nthen, as if some impulse had seized upon it, it uttered a wild and\r\nterrible shrieking kind of laugh; and then turning, dashed through the\r\nwindow, and in one instant disappeared from before the eyes of those who\r\nfelt nearly annihilated by its fearful presence.\r\n\r\n"God help us!" ejaculated Henry.\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale drew a long breath, and then, giving a stamp on the floor,\r\nas if to recover himself from the state of agitation into which even he\r\nwas thrown, he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Be it what or who it may, I\'ll follow it"\r\n\r\n"No--no--do not," cried the lady.\r\n\r\n"I must, I will. Let who will come with me--I follow that dreadful\r\nform."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he took the road it took, and dashed through the window\r\ninto the balcony.\r\n\r\n"And we, too, George," exclaimed Henry; "we will follow Mr. Marchdale.\r\nThis dreadful affair concerns us more nearly than it does him."\r\n\r\nThe lady who was the mother of these young men, and of the beautiful\r\ngirl who had been so awfully visited, screamed aloud, and implored of\r\nthem to stay. But the voice of Mr. Marchdale was heard exclaiming\r\naloud,--\r\n\r\n"I see it--I see it; it makes for the wall."\r\n\r\nThey hesitated no longer, but at once rushed into the balcony, and from\r\nthence dropped into the garden.\r\n\r\nThe mother approached the bed-side of the insensible, perhaps the\r\nmurdered girl; she saw her, to all appearance, weltering in blood, and,\r\novercome by her emotions, she fainted on the floor of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the two young men reached the garden, they found it much lighter\r\nthan might have been fairly expected; for not only was the morning\r\nrapidly approaching, but the mill was still burning, and those mingled\r\nlights made almost every object plainly visible, except when deep\r\nshadows were thrown from some gigantic trees that had stood for\r\ncenturies in that sweetly wooded spot. They heard the voice of Mr.\r\nMarchdale, as he cried,--\r\n\r\n"There--there--towards the wall. There--there--God! how it bounds\r\nalong."\r\n\r\nThe young men hastily dashed through a thicket in the direction from\r\nwhence his voice sounded, and then they found him looking wild and\r\nterrified, and with something in his hand which looked like a portion of\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\n"Which way, which way?" they both cried in a breath.\r\n\r\nHe leant heavily on the arm of George, as he pointed along a vista of\r\ntrees, and said in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"God help us all. It is not human. Look there--look there--do you not\r\nsee it?"\r\n\r\nThey looked in the direction he indicated. At the end of this vista was\r\nthe wall of the garden. At that point it was full twelve feet in height,\r\nand as they looked, they saw the hideous, monstrous form they had traced\r\nfrom the chamber of their sister, making frantic efforts to clear the\r\nobstacle.\r\n\r\nThen they saw it bound from the ground to the top of the wall, which it\r\nvery nearly reached, and then each time it fell back again into the\r\ngarden with such a dull, heavy sound, that the earth seemed to shake\r\nagain with the concussion. They trembled--well indeed they might, and\r\nfor some minutes they watched the figure making its fruitless efforts to\r\nleave the place.\r\n\r\n"What--what is it?" whispered Henry, in hoarse accents. "God, what can\r\nit possibly be?"\r\n\r\n"I know not," replied Mr. Marchdale. "I did seize it. It was cold and\r\nclammy like a corpse. It cannot be human."\r\n\r\n"Not human?"\r\n\r\n"Look at it now. It will surely escape now."\r\n\r\n"No, no--we will not be terrified thus--there is Heaven above us. Come\r\non, and, for dear Flora\'s sake, let us make an effort yet to seize this\r\nbold intruder."\r\n\r\n"Take this pistol," said Marchdale. "It is the fellow of the one I\r\nfired. Try its efficacy."\r\n\r\n"He will be gone," exclaimed Henry, as at this moment, after many\r\nrepeated attempts and fearful falls, the figure reached the top of the\r\nwall, and then hung by its long arms a moment or two, previous to\r\ndragging itself completely up.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the appearance, be it what it might, entirely escaping,\r\nseemed to nerve again Mr. Marchdale, and he, as well as the two young\r\nmen, ran forward towards the wall. They got so close to the figure\r\nbefore it sprang down on the outer side of the wall, that to miss\r\nkilling it with the bullet from the pistol was a matter of utter\r\nimpossibility, unless wilfully.\r\n\r\nHenry had the weapon, and he pointed it full at the tall form with a\r\nsteady aim. He pulled the trigger--the explosion followed, and that the\r\nbullet did its office there could be no manner of doubt, for the figure\r\ngave a howling shriek, and fell headlong from the wall on the outside.\r\n\r\n"I have shot him," cried Henry, "I have shot him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BODY.--FLORA\'S RECOVERY AND MADNESS.--THE OFFER\r\nOF ASSISTANCE FROM SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"He is human!" cried Henry; "I have surely killed him."\r\n\r\n"It would seem so," said Mr. Marchdale. "Let us now hurry round to the\r\noutside of the wall, and see where he lies."\r\n\r\nThis was at once agreed to, and the whole three of them made what\r\nexpedition they could towards a gate which led into a paddock, across\r\nwhich they hurried, and soon found themselves clear of the garden wall,\r\nso that they could make way towards where they fully expected to find\r\nthe body of him who had worn so unearthly an aspect, but who it would be\r\nan excessive relief to find was human.\r\n\r\nSo hurried was the progress they made, that it was scarcely possible to\r\nexchange many words as they went; a kind of breathless anxiety was upon\r\nthem, and in the speed they disregarded every obstacle, which would, at\r\nany other time, have probably prevented them from taking the direct road\r\nthey sought.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult on the outside of the wall to say exactly which was the\r\nprecise spot which it might be supposed the body had fallen on; but, by\r\nfollowing the wall in its entire length, surely they would come upon it.\r\n\r\nThey did so; but, to their surprise, they got from its commencement to\r\nits further extremity without finding any dead body, or even any\r\nsymptoms of one having lain there.\r\n\r\nAt some parts close to the wall there grew a kind of heath, and,\r\nconsequently, the traces of blood would be lost among it, if it so\r\nhappened that at the precise spot at which the strange being had seemed\r\nto topple over, such vegetation had existed. This was to be ascertained;\r\nbut now, after traversing the whole length of the wall twice, they came\r\nto a halt, and looked wonderingly in each other\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing here," said Harry.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," added his brother.\r\n\r\n"It could not have been a delusion," at length said Mr. Marchdale, with\r\na shudder.\r\n\r\n"A delusion?" exclaimed the brother! "That is not possible; we all saw\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Then what terrible explanation can we give?"\r\n\r\n"By heavens! I know not," exclaimed Henry. "This adventure surpasses all\r\nbelief, and but for the great interest we have in it, I should regard it\r\nwith a world of curiosity."\r\n\r\n"It is too dreadful," said George; "for God\'s sake, Henry, let us return\r\nto ascertain if poor Flora is killed."\r\n\r\n"My senses," said Henry, "were all so much absorbed in gazing at that\r\nhorrible form, that I never once looked towards her further than to see\r\nthat she was, to appearance, dead. God help her! poor--poor, beautiful\r\nFlora. This is, indeed, a sad, sad fate for you to come to.\r\nFlora--Flora--"\r\n\r\n"Do not weep, Henry," said George. "Rather let us now hasten home, where\r\nwe may find that tears are premature. She may yet be living and restored\r\nto us."\r\n\r\n"And," said Mr. Marchdale, "she may be able to give us some account of\r\nthis dreadful visitation."\r\n\r\n"True--true," exclaimed Henry; "we will hasten home."\r\n\r\nThey now turned their steps homeward, and as they went they much blamed\r\nthemselves for all leaving home together, and with terror pictured what\r\nmight occur in their absence to those who were now totally unprotected.\r\n\r\n"It was a rash impulse of us all to come in pursuit of this dreadful\r\nfigure," remarked Mr. Marchdale; "but do not torment yourself, Henry.\r\nThere may be no reason for your fears."\r\n\r\nAt the pace they went, they very soon reached the ancient house, and\r\nwhen they came in sight of it, they saw lights flashing from the\r\nwindows, and the shadows of faces moving to and fro, indicating that the\r\nwhole household was up, and in a state of alarm.\r\n\r\nHenry, after some trouble, got the hall door opened by a terrified\r\nservant, who was trembling so much that she could scarcely hold the\r\nlight she had with her.\r\n\r\n"Speak at once, Martha," said Henry. "Is Flora living?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but--"\r\n\r\n"Enough--enough! Thank God she lives; where is she now?"\r\n\r\n"In her own room, Master Henry. Oh, dear--oh, dear, what will become of\r\nus all?"\r\n\r\nHenry rushed up the staircase, followed by George and Mr. Marchdale, nor\r\npaused he once until he reached the room of his sister.\r\n\r\n"Mother," he said, before he crossed the threshold, "are you here?"\r\n\r\n"I am, my dear--I am. Come in, pray come in, and speak to poor Flora."\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry--"come in; we make no stranger of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThey all then entered the room.\r\n\r\nSeveral lights had been now brought into that antique chamber, and, in\r\naddition to the mother of the beautiful girl who had been so fearfully\r\nvisited, there were two female domestics, who appeared to be in the\r\ngreatest possible fright, for they could render no assistance whatever\r\nto anybody.\r\n\r\nThe tears were streaming down the mother\'s face, and the moment she saw\r\nMr. Marchdale, she clung to his arm, evidently unconscious of what she\r\nwas about, and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is this that has happened--what is this? Tell me, Marchdale!\r\nRobert Marchdale, you whom I have known even from my childhood, you will\r\nnot deceive me. Tell me the meaning of all this?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot," he said, in a tone of much emotion. "As God is my judge, I\r\nam as much puzzled and amazed at the scene that has taken place here\r\nto-night as you can be."\r\n\r\nThe mother wrung her hands and wept.\r\n\r\n"It was the storm that first awakened me," added Marchdale; "and then I\r\nheard a scream."\r\n\r\nThe brothers tremblingly approached the bed. Flora was placed in a\r\nsitting, half-reclining posture, propped up by pillows. She was quite\r\ninsensible, and her face was fearfully pale; while that she breathed at\r\nall could be but very faintly seen. On some of her clothing, about the\r\nneck, were spots of blood, and she looked more like one who had suffered\r\nsome long and grievous illness, than a young girl in the prime of life\r\nand in the most robust health, as she had been on the day previous to\r\nthe strange scene we have recorded.\r\n\r\n"Does she sleep?" said Henry, as a tear fell from his eyes upon her\r\npallid cheek.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mr. Marchdale. "This is a swoon, from which we must\r\nrecover her."\r\n\r\nActive measures were now adopted to restore the languid circulation,\r\nand, after persevering in them for some time, they had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing her open her eyes.\r\n\r\nHer first act upon consciousness returning, however, was to utter a loud\r\nshriek, and it was not until Henry implored her to look around her, and\r\nsee that she was surrounded by none but friendly faces, that she would\r\nventure again to open her eyes, and look timidly from one to the other.\r\nThen she shuddered, and burst into tears as she said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heaven, have mercy upon me--Heaven, have mercy upon me, and save me\r\nfrom that dreadful form."\r\n\r\n"There is no one here, Flora," said Mr. Marchdale, "but those who love\r\nyou, and who, in defence of you, if needs were would lay down their\r\nlives."\r\n\r\n"Oh, God! Oh, God!"\r\n\r\n"You have been terrified. But tell us distinctly what has happened? You\r\nare quite safe now."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe trembled so violently that Mr. Marchdale recommended that some\r\nstimulant should be given to her, and she was persuaded, although not\r\nwithout considerable difficulty, to swallow a small portion of some wine\r\nfrom a cup. There could be no doubt but that the stimulating effect of\r\nthe wine was beneficial, for a slight accession of colour visited her\r\ncheeks, and she spoke in a firmer tone as she said,--\r\n\r\n"Do not leave me. Oh, do not leave me, any of you. I shall die if left\r\nalone now. Oh, save me--save me. That horrible form! That fearful face!"\r\n\r\n"Tell us how it happened, dear Flora?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Or would you rather endeavour to get some sleep first?" suggested Mr.\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"No--no--no," she said, "I do not think I shall ever sleep again."\r\n\r\n"Say not so; you will be more composed in a few hours, and then you can\r\ntell us what has occurred."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you now. I will tell you now."\r\n\r\nShe placed her hands over her face for a moment, as if to collect her\r\nscattered, thoughts, and then she added,--\r\n\r\n"I was awakened by the storm, and I saw that terrible apparition at the\r\nwindow. I think I screamed, but I could not fly. Oh, God! I could not\r\nfly. It came--it seized me by the hair. I know no more. I know no more."\r\n\r\nShe passed her hand across her neck several times, and Mr. Marchdale\r\nsaid, in an anxious voice,--\r\n\r\n"You seem, Flora, to have hurt your neck--there is a wound."\r\n\r\n"A wound!" said the mother, and she brought a light close to the bed,\r\nwhere all saw on the side of Flora\'s neck a small punctured wound; or,\r\nrather two, for there was one a little distance from the other.\r\n\r\nIt was from these wounds the blood had come which was observable upon\r\nher night clothing.\r\n\r\n"How came these wounds?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," she replied. "I feel very faint and weak, as if I had\r\nalmost bled to death."\r\n\r\n"You cannot have done so, dear Flora, for there are not above\r\nhalf-a-dozen spots of blood to be seen at all."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale leaned against the carved head of the bed for support, and\r\nhe uttered a deep groan. All eyes were turned upon him, and Henry said,\r\nin a voice of the most anxious inquiry,--\r\n\r\n"You have something to say, Mr. Marchdale, which will throw some light\r\nupon this affair."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no, nothing!" cried Mr. Marchdale, rousing himself at once from\r\nthe appearance of depression that had come over him. "I have nothing to\r\nsay, but that I think Flora had better get some sleep if she can."\r\n\r\n"No sleep-no sleep for me," again screamed Flora. "Dare I be alone to\r\nsleep?"\r\n\r\n"But you shall not be alone, dear Flora," said Henry. "I will sit by\r\nyour bedside and watch you."\r\n\r\nShe took his hand in both hers, and while the tears chased each other\r\ndown her cheeks, she said,--\r\n\r\n"Promise me, Henry, by all your hopes of Heaven, you will not leave me."\r\n\r\n"I promise!"\r\n\r\nShe gently laid herself down, with a deep sigh, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\n"She is weak, and will sleep long," said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"You sigh," said Henry. "Some fearful thoughts, I feel certain, oppress\r\nyour heart."\r\n\r\n"Hush-hush!" said Mr. Marchdale, as he pointed to Flora. "Hush! not\r\nhere--not here."\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Let her sleep."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of some few minutes duration. Flora had dropped into\r\na deep slumber. That silence was first broken by George, who said,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marchdale, look at that portrait."\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the portrait in the frame to which we have alluded, and\r\nthe moment Marchdale looked at it he sunk into a chair as he\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven, how like!"\r\n\r\n"It is--it is," said Henry. "Those eyes--"\r\n\r\n"And see the contour of the countenance, and the strange shape of the\r\nmouth."\r\n\r\n"Exact--exact."\r\n\r\n"That picture shall be moved from here. The sight of it is at once\r\nsufficient to awaken all her former terrors in poor Flora\'s brain if she\r\nshould chance to awaken and cast her eyes suddenly upon it."\r\n\r\n"And is it so like him who came here?" said the mother.\r\n\r\n"It is the very man himself," said Mr. Marchdale. "I have not been in\r\nthis house long enough to ask any of you whose portrait that may be?"\r\n\r\n"It is," said Henry, "the portrait of Sir Runnagate Bannerworth, an\r\nancestor of ours, who first, by his vices, gave the great blow to the\r\nfamily prosperity."\r\n\r\n"Indeed. How long ago?"\r\n\r\n"About ninety years."\r\n\r\n"Ninety years. \'Tis a long while--ninety years."\r\n\r\n"You muse upon it."\r\n\r\n"No, no. I do wish, and yet I dread--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"To say something to you all. But not here--not here. We will hold a\r\nconsultation on this matter to-morrow. Not now--not now."\r\n\r\n"The daylight is coming quickly on," said Henry; "I shall keep my sacred\r\npromise of not moving from this room until Flora awakens; but there can\r\nbe no occasion for the detention of any of you. One is sufficient here.\r\nGo all of you, and endeavour to procure what rest you can."\r\n\r\n"I will fetch you my powder-flask and bullets," said Mr. Marchdale; "and\r\nyou can, if you please, reload the pistols. In about two hours more it\r\nwill be broad daylight."\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was adopted. Henry did reload the pistols, and placed\r\nthem on a table by the side of the bed, ready for immediate action, and\r\nthen, as Flora was sleeping soundly, all left the room but himself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth was the last to do so. She would have remained, but for\r\nthe earnest solicitation of Henry, that she would endeavour to get some\r\nsleep to make up for her broken night\'s repose, and she was indeed so\r\nbroken down by her alarm on Flora\'s account, that she had not power to\r\nresist, but with tears flowing from her eyes, she sought her own\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nAnd now the calmness of the night resumed its sway in that evil-fated\r\nmansion; and although no one really slept but Flora, all were still.\r\nBusy thought kept every one else wakeful. It was a mockery to lie down\r\nat all, and Henry, full of strange and painful feelings as he was,\r\npreferred his present position to the anxiety and apprehension on\r\nFlora\'s account which he knew he should feel if she were not within the\r\nsphere of his own observation, and she slept as soundly as some gentle\r\ninfant tired of its playmates and its sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING.--THE CONSULTATION.--THE FEARFUL SUGGESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat wonderfully different impressions and feelings, with regard to the\r\nsame circumstances, come across the mind in the broad, clear, and\r\nbeautiful light of day to what haunt the imagination, and often render\r\nthe judgment almost incapable of action, when the heavy shadow of night\r\nis upon all things.\r\n\r\nThere must be a downright physical reason for this effect--it is so\r\nremarkable and so universal. It seems that the sun\'s rays so completely\r\nalter and modify the constitution of the atmosphere, that it produces,\r\nas we inhale it, a wonderfully different effect upon the nerves of the\r\nhuman subject.\r\n\r\nWe can account for this phenomenon in no other way. Perhaps never in his\r\nlife had he, Henry Bannerworth, felt so strongly this transition of\r\nfeeling as he now felt it, when the beautiful daylight gradually dawned\r\nupon him, as he kept his lonely watch by the bedside of his slumbering\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nThat watch had been a perfectly undisturbed one. Not the least sight or\r\nsound of any intrusion had reached his senses. All had been as still as\r\nthe very grave.\r\n\r\nAnd yet while the night lasted, and he was more indebted to the rays of\r\nthe candle, which he had placed upon a shelf, for the power to\r\ndistinguish objects than to the light of the morning, a thousand uneasy\r\nand strange sensations had found a home in his agitated bosom.\r\n\r\nHe looked so many times at the portrait which was in the panel that at\r\nlength he felt an undefined sensation of terror creep over him whenever\r\nhe took his eyes off it.\r\n\r\nHe tried to keep himself from looking at it, but he found it vain, so he\r\nadopted what, perhaps, was certainly the wisest, best plan, namely, to\r\nlook at it continually.\r\n\r\nHe shifted his chair so that he could gaze upon it without any effort,\r\nand he placed the candle so that a faint light was thrown upon it, and\r\nthere he sat, a prey to many conflicting and uncomfortable feelings,\r\nuntil the daylight began to make the candle flame look dull and sickly.\r\n\r\nSolution for the events of the night he could find none. He racked his\r\nimagination in vain to find some means, however vague, of endeavouring\r\nto account for what occurred, and still he was at fault. All was to him\r\nwrapped in the gloom of the most profound mystery.\r\n\r\nAnd how strangely, too, the eyes of that portrait appeared to look upon\r\nhim--as if instinct with life, and as if the head to which they belonged\r\nwas busy in endeavouring to find out the secret communings of his soul.\r\nIt was wonderfully well executed that portrait; so life-like, that the\r\nvery features seemed to move as you gazed upon them.\r\n\r\n"It shall be removed," said Henry. "I would remove it now, but that it\r\nseems absolutely painted on the panel, and I should awake Flora in any\r\nattempt to do so."\r\n\r\nHe arose and ascertained that such was the case, and that it would\r\nrequire a workman, with proper tools adapted to the job, to remove the\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\n"True," he said, "I might now destroy it, but it is a pity to obscure a\r\nwork of such rare art as this is; I should blame myself if I were. It\r\nshall be removed to some other room of the house, however."\r\n\r\nThen, all of a sudden, it struck Henry how foolish it would be to remove\r\nthe portrait from the wall of a room which, in all likelihood, after\r\nthat night, would be uninhabited; for it was not probable that Flora\r\nwould choose again to inhabit a chamber in which she had gone through so\r\nmuch terror.\r\n\r\n"It can be left where it is," he said, "and we can fasten up, if we\r\nplease, even the very door of this room, so that no one need trouble\r\nthemselves any further about it."\r\n\r\nThe morning was now coming fast, and just as Henry thought he would\r\npartially draw a blind across the window, in order to shield from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun the eyes of Flora, she awoke.\r\n\r\n"Help--help!" she cried, and Henry was by her side in a moment.\r\n\r\n"You are safe, Flora--you are safe," he said.\r\n\r\n"Where is it now?" she said.\r\n\r\n"What--what, dear Flora?"\r\n\r\n"The dreadful apparition. Oh, what have I done to be made thus\r\nperpetually miserable?"\r\n\r\n"Think no more of it, Flora."\r\n\r\n"I must think. My brain is on fire! A million of strange eyes seem\r\ngazing on me."\r\n\r\n"Great Heaven! she raves," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Hark--hark--hark! He comes on the wings of the storm. Oh, it is most\r\nhorrible--horrible!"\r\n\r\nHenry rang the bell, but not sufficiently loudly to create any alarm.\r\nThe sound reached the waking ear of the mother, who in a few moments was\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n"She has awakened," said Henry, "and has spoken, but she seems to me to\r\nwander in her discourse. For God\'s sake, soothe her, and try to bring\r\nher mind round to its usual state."\r\n\r\n"I will, Henry--I will."\r\n\r\n"And I think, mother, if you were to get her out of this room, and into\r\nsome other chamber as far removed from this one as possible, it would\r\ntend to withdraw her mind from what has occurred."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it shall be done. Oh, Henry, what was it--what do you think it\r\nwas?"\r\n\r\n"I am lost in a sea of wild conjecture. I can form no conclusion; where\r\nis Mr. Marchdale?"\r\n\r\n"I believe in his chamber."\r\n\r\n"Then I will go and consult with him."\r\n\r\nHenry proceeded at once to the chamber, which was, as he knew, occupied\r\nby Mr. Marchdale; and as he crossed the corridor, he could not but pause\r\na moment to glance from a window at the face of nature.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, the terrific storm of the preceding evening had\r\ncleared the air, and rendered it deliciously invigorating and life-like.\r\nThe weather had been dull, and there had been for some days a certain\r\nheaviness in the atmosphere, which was now entirely removed.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun was shining with uncommon brilliancy, birds were singing\r\nin every tree and on every bush; so pleasant, so spirit-stirring,\r\nhealth-giving a morning, seldom had he seen. And the effect upon his\r\nspirits was great, although not altogether what it might have been, had\r\nall gone on as it usually was in the habit of doing at that house. The\r\nordinary little casualties of evil fortune had certainly from time to\r\ntime, in the shape of illness, and one thing or another, attacked the\r\nfamily of the Bannerworths in common with every other family, but here\r\nsuddenly had arisen a something at once terrible and inexplicable.\r\n\r\nHe found Mr. Marchdale up and dressed, and apparently in deep and\r\nanxious thought. The moment he saw Henry, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Flora is awake, I presume."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but her mind appears to be much disturbed."\r\n\r\n"From bodily weakness, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"But why should she be bodily weak? she was strong and well, ay, as well\r\nas she could ever be in all her life. The glow of youth and health was\r\non her cheeks. Is it possible that, in the course of one night, she\r\nshould become bodily weak to such an extent?"\r\n\r\n"Henry," said Mr. Marchdale, sadly, "sit down. I am not, as you know, a\r\nsuperstitious man."\r\n\r\n"You certainly are not."\r\n\r\n"And yet, I never in all my life was so absolutely staggered as I have\r\nbeen by the occurrences of to-night."\r\n\r\n"Say on."\r\n\r\n"There is a frightful, a hideous solution of them; one which every\r\nconsideration will tend to add strength to, one which I tremble to name\r\nnow, although, yesterday, at this hour, I should have laughed it to\r\nscorn."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is so. Tell no one that which I am about to say to you. Let the\r\ndreadful suggestion remain with ourselves alone, Henry Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"I--I am lost in wonder."\r\n\r\n"You promise me?"\r\n\r\n"What--what?"\r\n\r\n"That you will not repeat my opinion to any one."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"On your honour."\r\n\r\n"On my honour, I promise."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale rose, and proceeding to the door, he looked out to see\r\nthat there were no listeners near. Having ascertained then that they\r\nwere quite alone, he returned, and drawing a chair close to that on\r\nwhich Henry sat, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Henry, have you never heard of a strange and dreadful superstition\r\nwhich, in some countries, is extremely rife, by which it is supposed\r\nthat there are beings who never die."\r\n\r\n"Never die!"\r\n\r\n"Never. In a word, Henry, have you never heard of--of--I dread to\r\npronounce the word."\r\n\r\n"Speak it. God of Heaven! let me hear it."\r\n\r\n"A _vampyre_!"\r\n\r\nHenry sprung to his feet. His whole frame quivered with emotion; the\r\ndrops of perspiration stood upon his brow, as, in, a strange, hoarse\r\nvoice, he repeated the words,--\r\n\r\n"A vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Even so; one who has to renew a dreadful existence by human blood--one\r\nwho lives on for ever, and must keep up such a fearful existence upon\r\nhuman gore--one who eats not and drinks not as other men--a vampyre."\r\n\r\nHenry dropped into his seat, and uttered a deep groan of the most\r\nexquisite anguish.\r\n\r\n"I could echo that groan," said Marchdale, "but that I am so thoroughly\r\nbewildered I know not what to think."\r\n\r\n"Good God--good God!"\r\n\r\n"Do not too readily yield belief in so dreadful a supposition, I pray\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yield belief!" exclaimed Henry, as he rose, and lifted up one of his\r\nhands above his head. "No; by Heaven, and the great God of all, who\r\nthere rules, I will not easily believe aught so awful and so monstrous."\r\n\r\n"I applaud your sentiment, Henry; not willingly would I deliver up\r\nmyself to so frightful a belief--it is too horrible. I merely have told\r\nyou of that which you saw was on my mind. You have surely before heard\r\nof such things."\r\n\r\n"I have--I have."\r\n\r\n"I much marvel, then, that the supposition did not occur to you, Henry."\r\n\r\n"It did not--it did not, Marchdale. It--it was too dreadful, I suppose,\r\nto find a home in my heart. Oh! Flora, Flora, if this horrible idea\r\nshould once occur to you, reason cannot, I am quite sure, uphold you\r\nagainst it."\r\n\r\n"Let no one presume to insinuate it to her, Henry. I would not have it\r\nmentioned to her for worlds."\r\n\r\n"Nor I--nor I. Good God! I shudder at the very thought--the mere\r\npossibility; but there is no possibility, there can be none. I will not\r\nbelieve it."\r\n\r\n"Nor I."\r\n\r\n"No; by Heaven\'s justice, goodness, grace, and mercy, I will not believe\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Tis well sworn, Henry; and now, discarding the supposition that Flora\r\nhas been visited by a vampyre, let us seriously set about endeavouring,\r\nif we can, to account for what has happened in this house."\r\n\r\n"I--I cannot now."\r\n\r\n"Nay, let us examine the matter; if we can find any natural explanation,\r\nlet us cling to it, Henry, as the sheet-anchor of our very souls."\r\n\r\n"Do you think. You are fertile in expedients. Do you think, Marchdale;\r\nand, for Heaven\'s sake, and for the sake of our own peace, find out some\r\nother way of accounting for what has happened, than the hideous one you\r\nhave suggested."\r\n\r\n"And yet my pistol bullets hurt him not; he has left the tokens of his\r\npresence on the neck of Flora."\r\n\r\n"Peace, oh! peace. Do not, I pray you, accumulate reasons why I should\r\nreceive such a dismal, awful superstition. Oh, do not, Marchdale, as you\r\nlove me!"\r\n\r\n"You know that my attachment to you," said Marchdale, "is sincere; and\r\nyet, Heaven help us!"\r\n\r\nHis voice was broken by grief as he spoke, and he turned aside his head\r\nto hide the bursting tears that would, despite all his efforts, show\r\nthemselves in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Marchdale," added Henry, after a pause of some moments\' duration, "I\r\nwill sit up to-night with my sister."\r\n\r\n"Do--do!"\r\n\r\n"Think you there is a chance it may come again?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot--I dare not speculate upon the coming of so dreadful a\r\nvisitor, Henry; but I will hold watch with you most willingly."\r\n\r\n"You will, Marchdale?"\r\n\r\n"My hand upon it. Come what dangers may, I will share them with you,\r\nHenry."\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks. Say nothing, then, to George of what we have been\r\ntalking about. He is of a highly susceptible nature, and the very idea\r\nof such a thing would kill him."\r\n\r\n"I will; be mute. Remove your sister to some other chamber, let me beg\r\nof you, Henry; the one she now inhabits will always be suggestive of\r\nhorrible thoughts."\r\n\r\n"I will; and that dreadful-looking portrait, with its perfect likeness\r\nto him who came last night."\r\n\r\n"Perfect indeed. Do you intend to remove it?"\r\n\r\n"I do not. I thought of doing so; but it is actually on the panel in the\r\nwall, and I would not willingly destroy it, and it may as well remain\r\nwhere it is in that chamber, which I can readily now believe will become\r\nhenceforward a deserted one in this house."\r\n\r\n"It may well become such."\r\n\r\n"Who comes here? I hear a step."\r\n\r\nThere was a tip at the door at this moment, and George made his\r\nappearance in answer to the summons to come in. He looked pale and ill;\r\nhis face betrayed how much he had mentally suffered during that night,\r\nand almost directly he got into the bed-chamber he said,--\r\n\r\n"I shall, I am sure, be censured by you both for what I am going to say;\r\nbut I cannot help saying it, nevertheless, for to keep it to myself\r\nwould destroy me."\r\n\r\n"Good God, George! what is it?" said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Speak it out!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking of what has occurred here, and the result of that\r\nthought has been one of the wildest suppositions that ever I thought I\r\nshould have to entertain. Have you never heard of a vampyre?"\r\n\r\nHenry sighed deeply, and Marchdale was silent.\r\n\r\n"I say a vampyre," added George, with much excitement in his manner. "It\r\nis a fearful, a horrible supposition; but our poor, dear Flora has been\r\nvisited by a vampyre, and I shall go completely mad!"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and covering his face with his hands, he wept bitterly and\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\n"George," said Henry, when he saw that the frantic grief had in some\r\nmeasure abated--"be calm, George, and endeavour to listen to me."\r\n\r\n"I hear, Henry."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, do not suppose that you are the only one in this house to\r\nwhom so dreadful a superstition has occurred."\r\n\r\n"Not the only one?"\r\n\r\n"No; it has occurred to Mr. Marchdale also."\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven!"\r\n\r\n"He mentioned it to me; but we have both agreed to repudiate it with\r\nhorror."\r\n\r\n"To--repudiate--it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, George."\r\n\r\n"And yet--and yet--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush! I know what you would say. You would tell us that our\r\nrepudiation of it cannot affect the fact. Of that we are aware; but yet\r\nwill we disbelieve that which a belief in would be enough to drive us\r\nmad."\r\n\r\n"What do you intend to do?"\r\n\r\n"To keep this supposition to ourselves, in the first place; to guard it\r\nmost zealously from the ears of Flora."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she has ever heard of vampyres?"\r\n\r\n"I never heard her mention that in all her reading she had gathered even\r\na hint of such a fearful superstition. If she has, we must be guided by\r\ncircumstances, and do the best we can."\r\n\r\n"Pray Heaven she may not!"\r\n\r\n"Amen to that prayer, George," said Henry. "Mr. Marchdale and I intend\r\nto keep watch over Flora to-night."\r\n\r\n"May not I join you?"\r\n\r\n"Your health, dear George, will not permit you to engage in such\r\nmatters. Do you seek your natural repose, and leave it to us to do the\r\nbest we can in this most fearful and terrible emergency."\r\n\r\n"As you please, brother, and as you please, Mr. Marchdale. I know I am a\r\nfrail reed, and my belief is that this affair will kill me quite. The\r\ntruth is, I am horrified--utterly and frightfully horrified. Like my\r\npoor, dear sister, I do not believe I shall ever sleep again."\r\n\r\n"Do not fancy that, George," said Marchdale. "You very much add to the\r\nuneasiness which must be your poor mother\'s portion, by allowing this\r\ncircumstance to so much affect you. You well know her affection for you\r\nall, and let me therefore, as a very old friend of hers, entreat you to\r\nwear as cheerful an aspect as you can in her presence."\r\n\r\n"For once in my life," said George, sadly, "I will; to my dear mother,\r\nendeavour to play the hypocrite."\r\n\r\n"Do so," said Henry. "The motive will sanction any such deceit as that,\r\nGeorge, be assured."\r\n\r\nThe day wore on, and Poor Flora remained in a very precarious situation.\r\nIt was not until mid-day that Henry made up his mind he would call in a\r\nmedical gentleman to her, and then he rode to the neighbouring\r\nmarket-town, where he knew an extremely intelligent practitioner\r\nresided. This gentleman Henry resolved upon, under a promise of secrecy,\r\nmakings confidant of; but, long before he reached him, he found he might\r\nwell dispense with the promise of secrecy.\r\n\r\nHe had never thought, so engaged had he been with other matters, that\r\nthe servants were cognizant of the whole affair, and that from them he\r\nhad no expectation of being able to keep the whole story in all its\r\ndetails. Of course such an opportunity for tale-bearing and gossiping\r\nwas not likely to be lost; and while Henry was thinking over how he had\r\nbetter act in the matter, the news that Flora Bannerworth had been\r\nvisited in the night by a vampyre--for the servants named the visitation\r\nsuch at once--was spreading all over the county.\r\n\r\nAs he rode along, Henry met a gentleman on horseback who belonged to the\r\ncounty, and who, reining in his steed, said to him,\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Good morning," responded Henry, and he would have ridden on, but the\r\ngentleman added,--\r\n\r\n"Excuse me for interrupting you, sir; but what is the strange story that\r\nis in everybody\'s mouth about a vampyre?"\r\n\r\nHenry nearly fell off his horse, he was so much astonished, and,\r\nwheeling the animal around, he said,--\r\n\r\n"In everybody\'s mouth!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have heard it from at least a dozen persons."\r\n\r\n"You surprise me."\r\n\r\n"It is untrue? Of course I am not so absurd as really to believe about\r\nthe vampyre; but is there no foundation at all for it? We generally find\r\nthat at the bottom of these common reports there is a something around\r\nwhich, as a nucleus, the whole has formed."\r\n\r\n"My sister is unwell."\r\n\r\n"Ah, and that\'s all. It really is too bad, now."\r\n\r\n"We had a visitor last night."\r\n\r\n"A thief, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--I believe a thief. I do believe it was a thief, and she was\r\nterrified."\r\n\r\n"Of course, and upon such a thing is grafted a story of a vampyre, and\r\nthe marks of his teeth being in her neck, and all the circumstantial\r\nparticulars."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth."\r\n\r\nHenry bade the gentleman good morning, and much vexed at the publicity\r\nwhich the affair had already obtained, he set spurs to his horse,\r\ndetermined that he would speak to no one else upon so uncomfortable a\r\ntheme. Several attempts were made to stop him, but he only waved his\r\nhand and trotted on, nor did he pause in his speed till he reached the\r\ndoor of Mr. Chillingworth, the medical man whom he intended to consult.\r\n\r\nHenry knew that at such a time he would be at home, which was the case,\r\nand he was soon closeted with the man of drugs. Henry begged his patient\r\nhearing, which being accorded, he related to him at full length what had\r\nhappened, not omitting, to the best of his remembrance, any one\r\nparticular. When he had concluded his narration, the doctor shifted his\r\nposition several times, and then said,--\r\n\r\n"That\'s all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and enough too."\r\n\r\n"More than enough, I should say, my young friend. You astonish me."\r\n\r\n"Can you form any supposition, sir, on the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Not just now. What is your own idea?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot be said to have one about it. It is too absurd to tell you\r\nthat my brother George is impressed with a belief a vampyre has visited\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\n"I never in all my life heard a more circumstantial narrative in favour\r\nof so hideous a superstition."\r\n\r\n"Well, but you cannot believe--"\r\n\r\n"Believe what?"\r\n\r\n"That the dead can come to life again, and by such a process keep up\r\nvitality."\r\n\r\n"Do you take me for a fool?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you ask me such questions?"\r\n\r\n"But the glaring facts of the case."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if they were ten times more glaring, I won\'t believe it. I\r\nwould rather believe you were all mad, the whole family of you--that at\r\nthe full of the moon you all were a little cracked."\r\n\r\n"And so would I."\r\n\r\n"You go home now, and I will call and see your sister in the course of\r\ntwo hours. Something may turn up yet, to throw some new light upon this\r\nstrange subject."\r\n\r\nWith this understanding Henry went home, and he took care to ride as\r\nfast as before, in order to avoid questions, so that he got back to his\r\nold ancestral home without going through the disagreeable ordeal of\r\nhaving to explain to any one what had disturbed the peace of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry reached his home, he found that the evening was rapidly\r\ncoming on, and before he could permit himself to think upon any other\r\nsubject, he inquired how his terrified sister had passed the hours\r\nduring his absence.\r\n\r\nHe found that but little improvement had taken place in her, and that\r\nshe had occasionally slept, but to awaken and speak incoherently, as if\r\nthe shock she had received had had some serious affect upon her nerves.\r\nHe repaired at once to her room, and, finding that she was awake, he\r\nleaned over her, and spoke tenderly to her.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, "dear Flora, you are better now?"\r\n\r\n"Harry, is that you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me what has happened?"\r\n\r\n"Have you not a recollection, Flora?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Henry; but what was it? They none of them will tell me what\r\nit was, Henry."\r\n\r\n"Be calm, dear. No doubt some attempt to rob the house."\r\n\r\n"Think you so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the bay window was peculiarly adapted for such a purpose; but now\r\nthat you are removed here to this room, you will be able to rest in\r\npeace."\r\n\r\n"I shall die of terror, Henry. Even now those eyes are glaring on me so\r\nhidiously. Oh, it is fearful--it is very fearful, Henry. Do you not pity\r\nme, and no one will promise to remain with me at night."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Flora, you are mistaken, for I intend to sit by your bedside\r\narmed, and so preserve you from all harm."\r\n\r\nShe clutched his hand eagerly, as she said,--\r\n\r\n"You will, Henry. You will, and not think it too much trouble, dear\r\nHenry."\r\n\r\n"It can be no trouble, Flora."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall rest in peace, for I know that the dreadful vampyre cannot\r\ncome to me when you are by-"\r\n\r\n"The what, Flora!"\r\n\r\n"The vampyre, Henry. It was a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Good God, who told you so?"\r\n\r\n"No one. I have read of them in the book of travels in Norway, which Mr.\r\nMarchdale lent us all."\r\n\r\n"Alas, alas!" groaned Henry. "Discard, I pray you, such a thought from\r\nyour mind."\r\n\r\n"Can we discard thoughts. What power have we but from that mind, which\r\nis ourselves?"\r\n\r\n"True, true."\r\n\r\n"Hark, what noise is that? I thought I heard a noise. Henry, when you\r\ngo, ring for some one first. Was there not a noise?"\r\n\r\n"The accidental shutting of some door, dear."\r\n\r\n"Was it that?"\r\n\r\n"It was."\r\n\r\n"Then I am relieved. Henry, I sometimes fancy I am in the tomb, and that\r\nsome one is feasting on my flesh. They do say, too, that those who in\r\nlife have been bled by a vampyre, become themselves vampyres, and have\r\nthe same horrible taste for blood as those before them. Is it not\r\nhorrible?"\r\n\r\n"You only vex yourself by such thoughts, Flora. Mr. Chillingworth is\r\ncoming to see you."\r\n\r\n"Can he minister to a mind diseased?"\r\n\r\n"But yours is not, Flora. Your mind is healthful, and so, although his\r\npower extends not so far, we will thank Heaven, dear Flora, that you\r\nneed it not."\r\n\r\nShe sighed deeply, as she said,--\r\n\r\n"Heaven help me! I know not, Henry. The dreadful being held on by my\r\nhair. I must have it all taken off. I tried to get away, but it dragged\r\nme back--a brutal thing it was. Oh, then at that moment, Henry, I felt\r\nas if something strange took place in my brain, and that I was going\r\nmad! I saw those glazed eyes close to, mine--I felt a hot, pestiferous\r\nbreath upon my face--help--help!"\r\n\r\n"Hush! my Flora, hush! Look at me."\r\n\r\n"I am calm again. It fixed its teeth in my throat. Did I faint away?"\r\n\r\n"You did, dear; but let me pray you to refer all this to imagination; or\r\nat least the greater part of it."\r\n\r\n"But you saw it."\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"All saw it."\r\n\r\n"We all saw some man--a housebreaker--It must have been some\r\nhousebreaker. What more easy, you know, dear Flora, than to assume some\r\nsuch disguise?"\r\n\r\n"Was anything stolen?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of; but there was an alarm, you know."\r\n\r\nFlora shook her head, as she said, in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"That which came here was more than mortal. Oh, Henry, if it had but\r\nkilled me, now I had been happy; but I cannot live--I hear it breathing\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Talk of something else, dear Flora," said the much distressed Henry;\r\n"you will make yourself much worse, if you indulge yourself in these\r\nstrange fancies."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that they were but fancies!"\r\n\r\n"They are, believe me."\r\n\r\n"There is a strange confusion in my brain, and sleep comes over me\r\nsuddenly, when I least expect it. Henry, Henry, what I was, I shall\r\nnever, never be again."\r\n\r\n"Say not so. All this will pass away like a dream, and leave so faint a\r\ntrace upon your memory, that the time will come when you will wonder it\r\never made so deep an impression on your mind."\r\n\r\n"You utter these words, Henry," she said, "but they do not come from\r\nyour heart. Ah, no, no, no! Who comes?"\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by Mrs. Bannerworth, who said,--\r\n\r\n"It is only me, my dear. Henry, here is Dr. Chillingworth in the\r\ndining-room."\r\n\r\nHenry turned to Flora, saying,--\r\n\r\n"You will see him, dear Flora? You know Mr. Chillingworth well."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Henry, yes, I will see him, or whoever you please."\r\n\r\n"Shew Mr. Chillingworth up," said Henry to the servant.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the medical man was in the room, and he at once\r\napproached the bedside to speak to Flora, upon whose pale countenance he\r\nlooked with evident interest, while at the same time it seemed mingled\r\nwith a painful feeling--at least so his own face indicated.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Bannerworth," he said, "what is all this I hear about an\r\nugly dream you have had?"\r\n\r\n"A dream?" said Flora, as she fixed her beautiful eyes on his face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, as I understand."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and was silent.\r\n\r\n"Was it not a dream, then?" added Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\nShe wrung her hands, and in a voice of extreme anguish and pathos,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Would it were a dream--would it were a dream! Oh, if any one could but\r\nconvince me it was a dream!"\r\n\r\n"Well, will you tell me what it was?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, it was a vampyre."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth glanced at Henry, as he said, in reply to Flora\'s\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n"I suppose that is, after all, another name, Flora, for the nightmare?"\r\n\r\n"No--no--no!"\r\n\r\n"Do you really, then, persist in believing anything so absurd, Miss\r\nBannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"What can I say to the evidence of my own senses?" she replied. "I saw\r\nit, Henry saw it, George saw, Mr. Marchdale, my mother--all saw it. We\r\ncould not all be at the same time the victims of the same delusion."\r\n\r\n"How faintly you speak."\r\n\r\n"I am very faint and ill."\r\n\r\n"Indeed. What wound is that on your neck?"\r\n\r\nA wild expression came over the face of Flora; a spasmodic action of the\r\nmuscles, accompanied with a shuddering, as if a sudden chill had come\r\nover the whole mass of blood took place, and she said,--\r\n\r\n"It is the mark left by the teeth of the vampyre."\r\n\r\nThe smile was a forced one upon the face of Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Draw up the blind of the window, Mr. Henry," he said, "and let me\r\nexamine this puncture to which your sister attaches so extraordinary a\r\nmeaning."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe blind was drawn up, and a strong light was thrown into the room. For\r\nfull two minutes Mr. Chillingworth attentively examined the two small\r\nwounds in the neck of Flora. He took a powerful magnifying glass from\r\nhis pocket, and looked at them through it, and after his examination was\r\nconcluded, he said,--\r\n\r\n"They are very trifling wounds, indeed."\r\n\r\n"But how inflicted?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"By some insect, I should say, which probably--it being the season for\r\nmany insects--has flown in at the window."\r\n\r\n"I know the motive," said Flora "which prompts all these suggestions it\r\nis a kind one, and I ought to be the last to quarrel with it; but what I\r\nhave seen, nothing can make me believe I saw not, unless I am, as once\r\nor twice I have thought myself, really mad."\r\n\r\n"How do you now feel in general health?"\r\n\r\n"Far from well; and a strange drowsiness at times creeps over me. Even\r\nnow I feel it."\r\n\r\nShe sunk back on the pillows as she spoke and closed her eyes with a\r\ndeep sigh.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth beckoned Henry to come with him from the room, but the\r\nlatter had promised that he would remain with Flora; and as Mrs.\r\nBannerworth had left the chamber because she was unable to control her\r\nfeelings, he rang the bell, and requested that his mother would come.\r\n\r\nShe did so, and then Henry went down stairs along with the medical man,\r\nwhose opinion he was certainly eager to be now made acquainted with.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone in an old-fashioned room which was called the\r\noak closet, Henry turned to Mr. Chillingworth, and said,--\r\n\r\n"What, now, is your candid opinion, sir? You have seen my sister, and\r\nthose strange indubitable evidences of something wrong."\r\n\r\n"I have; and to tell you candidly the truth, Mr. Henry, I am sorely\r\nperplexed."\r\n\r\n"I thought you would be."\r\n\r\n"It is not often that a medical man likes to say so much, nor is it,\r\nindeed, often prudent that he should do so, but in this case I own I am\r\nmuch puzzled. It is contrary to all my notions upon all such subjects."\r\n\r\n"Those wounds, what do you think of them?"\r\n\r\n"I know not what to think. I am completely puzzled as regards them."\r\n\r\n"But, but do they not really bear the appearance of being bites?"\r\n\r\n"They really do."\r\n\r\n"And so far, then, they are actually in favour of the dreadful\r\nsupposition which poor Flora entertains."\r\n\r\n"So far they certainly are. I have no doubt in the world of their being\r\nbites; but we not must jump to a conclusion that the teeth which\r\ninflicted them were human. It is a strange case, and one which I feel\r\nassured must give you all much uneasiness, as, indeed, it gave me; but,\r\nas I said before, I will not let my judgment give in to the fearful and\r\ndegrading superstition which all the circumstances connected with this\r\nstrange story would seem to justify."\r\n\r\n"It is a degrading superstition."\r\n\r\n"To my mind your sister seems to be labouring under the effect of some\r\nnarcotic."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; unless she really has lost a quantity of blood, which loss has\r\ndecreased the heart\'s action sufficiently to produce the languor under\r\nwhich she now evidently labours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that I could believe the former supposition, but I am confident she\r\nhas taken no narcotic; she could not even do so by mistake, for there is\r\nno drug of the sort in the house. Besides, she is not heedless by any\r\nmeans. I am quite convinced she has not done so."\r\n\r\n"Then I am fairly puzzled, my young friend, and I can only say that I\r\nwould freely have given half of what I am worth to see that figure you\r\nsaw last night."\r\n\r\n"What would you have done?"\r\n\r\n"I would not have lost sight of it for the world\'s wealth."\r\n\r\n"You would have felt your blood freeze with horror. The face was\r\nterrible."\r\n\r\n"And yet let it lead me where it liked I would have followed it."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had been here."\r\n\r\n"I wish to Heaven I had. If I though there was the least chance of\r\nanother visit I would come and wait with patience every night for a\r\nmonth."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say," replied Henry. "I am going to sit up to-night with my\r\nsister, and I believe, our friend Mr. Marchdale will share my watch with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth appeared to be for a few moments lost in thought, and\r\nthen suddenly rousing himself, as if he found it either impossible to\r\ncome to any rational conclusion upon the subject, or had arrived at one\r\nwhich he chose to keep to himself, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we must leave the matter at present as it stands. Time may\r\naccomplish something towards its development, but at present so palpable\r\na mystery I never came across, or a matter in which human calculation\r\nwas so completely foiled."\r\n\r\n"Nor I--nor I."\r\n\r\n"I will send you some medicines, such as I think will be of service to\r\nFlora, and depend upon seeing me by ten o\'clock to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"You have, of course, heard something," said Henry to the doctor, as he\r\nwas pulling on his gloves, "about vampyres."\r\n\r\n"I certainly have, and I understand that in some countries, particularly\r\nNorway and Sweden, the superstition is a very common one."\r\n\r\n"And in the Levant."\r\n\r\n"Yes. The ghouls of the Mahometans are of the same description of\r\nbeings. All that I have heard of the European vampyre has made it a\r\nbeing which can be killed, but is restored to life again by the rays of\r\na full moon falling on the body."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I have heard as much."\r\n\r\n"And that the hideous repast of blood has to be taken very frequently,\r\nand that if the vampyre gets it not he wastes away, presenting the\r\nappearance of one in the last stage of a consumption, and visibly, so to\r\nspeak, dying."\r\n\r\n"That is what I have understood."\r\n\r\n"To-night, do you know, Mr. Bannerworth, is the full of the moon."\r\n\r\nHenry started.\r\n\r\n"If now you had succeeded in killing--. Pshaw, what am I saying. I\r\nbelieve I am getting foolish, and that the horrible superstition is\r\nbeginning to fasten itself upon me as well as upon all of you. How\r\nstrangely the fancy will wage war with the judgment in such a way as\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"The full of the moon," repeated Henry, as he glanced towards the\r\nwindow, "and the night is near at hand."\r\n\r\n"Banish these thoughts from your mind," said the doctor, "or else, my\r\nyoung friend, you will make yourself decidedly ill. Good evening to you,\r\nfor it is evening. I shall see you to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth appeared now to be anxious to go, and Henry no longer\r\nopposed his departure; but when he was gone a sense of great loneliness\r\ncame over him.\r\n\r\n"To-night," he repeated, "is the full of the moon. How strange that this\r\ndreadful adventure should have taken place just the night before. \'Tis\r\nvery strange. Let me see--let me see."\r\n\r\nHe took from the shelves of a book case the work which Flora had\r\nmentioned, entitled, "Travels in Norway," in which work he found some\r\naccount of the popular belief in vampyres.\r\n\r\nHe opened the work at random, and then some of the leaves turned over of\r\nthemselves to a particular place, as the leaves of a book will\r\nfrequently do when it has been kept open a length of time at that part,\r\nand the binding stretched there more than anywhere else. There was a\r\nnote at the bottom of one of the pages at this part of the book, and\r\nHenry read as follows:--\r\n\r\n"With regard to these vampyres, it is believed by those who are inclined\r\nto give credence to so dreadful a superstition, that they always\r\nendeavour to make their feast of blood, for the revival of their bodily\r\npowers, on some evening immediately preceding a full moon, because if\r\nany accident befal them, such as being shot, or otherwise killed or\r\nwounded, they can recover by lying down somewhere where the full moon\'s\r\nrays will fall upon them."\r\n\r\nHenry let the book drop from his hands with a groan and a shudder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT WATCH.--THE PROPOSAL.--THE MOONLIGHT.--THE FEARFUL ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA kind of stupefaction came over Henry Bannerworth, and he sat for about\r\na quarter of an hour scarcely conscious of where he was, and almost\r\nincapable of anything in the shape of rational thought. It was his\r\nbrother, George, who roused him by saying, as he laid his hand upon his\r\nshoulder,--\r\n\r\n"Henry, are you asleep?"\r\n\r\nHenry had not been aware of his presence, and he started up as if he had\r\nbeen shot.\r\n\r\n"Oh, George, is it you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Henry, are you unwell?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; I was in a deep reverie."\r\n\r\n"Alas! I need not ask upon what subject," said George, sadly. "I sought\r\nyou to bring you this letter."\r\n\r\n"A letter to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you see it is addressed to you, and the seal looks as if it came\r\nfrom someone of consequence."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Henry. Read it, and see from whence it comes."\r\n\r\nThere was just sufficient light by going to the window to enable Henry\r\nto read the letter, which he did aloud.\r\n\r\nIt ran thus:--\r\n\r\n     "Sir Francis Varney presents his compliments to Mr. Beaumont, and\r\n     is much concerned to hear that some domestic affliction has\r\n     fallen upon him. Sir Francis hopes that the genuine and loving\r\n     sympathy of a neighbour will not be regarded as an intrusion, and\r\n     begs to proffer any assistance or counsel that may be within the\r\n     compass of his means.\r\n\r\n     "Ratford Abbey."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney!" said Henry, "who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Do you not remember, Henry," said George, "we were told a few days ago,\r\nthat a gentleman of that name had become the purchaser of the estate of\r\nRatford Abbey."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes. Have you seen him?"\r\n\r\n"I have not."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to make any new acquaintance, George. We are very\r\npoor--much poorer indeed than the general appearance of this place,\r\nwhich, I fear, we shall soon have to part with, would warrant any one\r\nbelieving. I must, of course, return a civil answer to this gentleman,\r\nbut it must be such as one as shall repress familiarity."\r\n\r\n"That will be difficult to do while we remain here, when we come to\r\nconsider the very close proximity of the two properties, Henry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not at all. He will easily perceive that we do not want to make\r\nacquaintance with him, and then, as a gentleman, which doubtless he is,\r\nhe will give up the attempt."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so, Henry. Heaven knows I have no desire to form any new\r\nacquaintance with any one, and more particularly under our present\r\ncircumstances of depression. And now, Henry, you must permit me, as I\r\nhave had some repose, to share with you your night watch in Flora\'s\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"I would advise you not, George; your health, you know, is very far from\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"Nay, allow me. If not, then the anxiety I shall suffer will do me more\r\nharm than the watchfulness I shall keep up in her chamber."\r\n\r\nThis was an argument which Henry felt himself the force of too strongly\r\nnot to admit it in the case of George, and he therefore made no further\r\nopposition to his wish to make one in the night watch.\r\n\r\n"There will be an advantage," said George, "you see, in three of us\r\nbeing engaged in this matter, because, should anything occur, two can\r\nact together, and yet Flora may not be left alone."\r\n\r\n"True, true, that is a great advantage."\r\n\r\nNow a soft gentle silvery light began to spread itself over the heavens.\r\nThe moon was rising, and as the beneficial effects of the storm of the\r\npreceding evening were still felt in the clearness of the air, the rays\r\nappeared to be more lustrous and full of beauty than they commonly were.\r\n\r\nEach moment the night grew lighter, and by the time the brothers were\r\nready to take their places in the chamber of Flora, the moon had risen\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nAlthough neither Henry nor George had any objection to the company of\r\nMr. Marchdale, yet they gave him the option, and rather in fact urged\r\nhim not to destroy his night\'s repose by sitting up with them; but he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Allow me to do so; I am older, and have calmer judgment than you can\r\nhave. Should anything again appear, I am quite resolved that it shall\r\nnot escape me."\r\n\r\n"What would you do?"\r\n\r\n"With the name of God upon my lips," said Mr. Marchdale, solemnly, "I\r\nwould grapple with it."\r\n\r\n"You laid hands upon it last night."\r\n\r\n"I did, and have forgotten to show you what I tore from it. Look\r\nhere,--what should you say this was?"\r\n\r\nHe produced a piece of cloth, on which was an old-fashioned piece of\r\nlace, and two buttons. Upon a close inspection, this appeared to be a\r\nportion of the lapel of a coat of ancient times, and suddenly, Henry,\r\nwith a look of intense anxiety, said,--\r\n\r\n"This reminds me of the fashion of garments very many years ago, Mr.\r\nMarchdale."\r\n\r\n"It came away in my grasp as if rotten and incapable of standing any\r\nrough usage."\r\n\r\n"What a strange unearthly smell it has!"\r\n\r\n"Now you mention it yourself," added Mr. Marchdale, "I must confess it\r\nsmells to me as if it had really come from the very grave."\r\n\r\n"It does--it does. Say nothing of this relic of last night\'s work to any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"Be assured I shall not. I am far from wishing to keep up in any one\'s\r\nmind proofs of that which I would fain, very fain refute."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale replaced the portion of the coat which the figure had worn\r\nin his pocket, and then the whole three proceeded to the chamber of\r\nFlora.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was within a very few minutes of midnight, the moon had climbed high\r\nin the heavens, and a night of such brightness and beauty had seldom\r\nshown itself for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nFlora slept, and in her chamber sat the two brothers and Mr. Marchdale,\r\nsilently, for she had shown symptoms of restlessness, and they much\r\nfeared to break the light slumber into which she had fallen.\r\n\r\nOccasionally they had conversed in whispers, which could not have the\r\neffect of rousing her, for the room, although smaller than the one she\r\nhad before occupied, was still sufficiently spacious to enable them to\r\nget some distance from the bed.\r\n\r\nUntil the hour of midnight now actually struck, they were silent, and\r\nwhen the last echo of the sounds had died away, a feeling of uneasiness\r\ncame over them, which prompted some conversation to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n"How bright the moon is now," said Henry, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"I never saw it brighter," replied Marchdale. "I feel as if I were\r\nassured that we shall not to-night be interrupted."\r\n\r\n"It was later than this," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"It was--it was."\r\n\r\n"Do not then yet congratulate us upon no visit."\r\n\r\n"How still the house is!" remarked George; "it seems to me as if I had\r\nnever found it so intensely quiet before."\r\n\r\n"It is very still."\r\n\r\n"Hush! she moves."\r\n\r\nFlora moaned in her sleep, and made a slight movement. The curtains were\r\nall drawn closely round the bed to shield her eyes from the bright\r\nmoonlight which streamed into the room so brilliantly. They might have\r\nclosed the shutters of the window, but this they did not like to do, as\r\nit would render their watch there of no avail at all, inasmuch as they\r\nwould not be able to see if any attempt was made by any one to obtain\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour longer might have thus passed when Mr. Marchdale\r\nsaid in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n"A thought has just struck me that the piece of coat I have, which I\r\ndragged from the figure last night, wonderfully resembles in colour and\r\nappearance the style of dress of the portrait in the room which Flora\r\nlately slept in."\r\n\r\n"I thought of that," said Henry, "when first I saw it; but, to tell the\r\nhonest truth, I dreaded to suggest any new proof connected with last\r\nnight\'s visitation."\r\n\r\n"Then I ought not to have drawn your attention to it," said Mr.\r\nMarchdale, "and regret I have done so."\r\n\r\n"Nay, do not blame yourself on such an account," said Henry. "You are\r\nquite right, and it is I who am too foolishly sensitive. Now, however,\r\nsince you have mentioned it, I must own I have a great desire to test\r\nthe accuracy of the observation by a comparison with the portrait."\r\n\r\n"That may easily be done."\r\n\r\n"I will remain here," said George, "in case Flora awakens, while you two\r\ngo if you like. It is but across the corridor."\r\n\r\nHenry immediately rose, saying--\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Marchdale, come. Let us satisfy ourselves at all events upon\r\nthis point at once. As George says it is only across the corridor, and\r\nwe can return directly."\r\n\r\n"I am willing," said Mr. Marchdale, with a tone of sadness.\r\n\r\nThere was no light needed, for the moon stood suspended in a cloudless\r\nsky, so that from the house being a detached one, and containing\r\nnumerous windows, it was as light as day.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance from one chamber to the other was only across the\r\ncorridor, it was a greater space than these words might occupy, for the\r\ncorridor was wide, neither was it directly across, but considerably\r\nslanting. However, it was certainly sufficiently close at hand for any\r\nsound of alarm from one chamber to reach another without any difficulty.\r\n\r\nA few moments sufficed to place Henry and Mr. Marchdale in that antique\r\nroom, where, from the effect of the moonlight which was streaming over\r\nit, the portrait on the panel looked exceedingly life like.\r\n\r\nAnd this effect was probably the greater because the rest of the room\r\nwas not illuminated by the moon\'s rays, which came through a window in\r\nthe corridor, and then at the open door of that chamber upon the\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale held the piece of cloth he had close to the dress of the\r\nportrait, and one glance was sufficient to show the wonderful likeness\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said Henry, "it is the same."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale dropped the piece of cloth and trembled.\r\n\r\n"This fact shakes even your scepticism," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I know not what to make of it."\r\n\r\n"I can tell you something which bears upon it. I do not know if you are\r\nsufficiently aware of my family history to know that this one of my\r\nancestors, I wish I could say worthy ancestors, committed suicide, and\r\nwas buried in his clothes."\r\n\r\n"You--you are sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure."\r\n\r\n"I am more and more bewildered as each moment some strange corroborative\r\nfact of that dreadful supposition we so much shrink from seems to come\r\nto light and to force itself upon our attention."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of a few moments duration, and Henry had turned\r\ntowards Mr. Marchdale to say something, when the cautious tread of a\r\nfootstep was heard in the garden, immediately beneath that balcony.\r\n\r\nA sickening sensation came over Henry, and he was compelled to lean\r\nagainst the wall for support, as in scarcely articulate accents he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"The vampyre--the vampyre! God of heaven, it has come once again!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Heaven inspire us with more than mortal courage," cried Mr.\r\nMarchdale, and he dashed open the window at once, and sprang into the\r\nbalcony.\r\n\r\nHenry in a moment recovered himself sufficiently to follow him, and when\r\nhe reached his side in the balcony, Marchdale said, as he pointed\r\nbelow,--\r\n\r\n"There is some one concealed there."\r\n\r\n"Where--where?"\r\n\r\n"Among the laurels. I will fire a random shot, and we may do some\r\nexecution."\r\n\r\n"Hold!" said a voice from below; "don\'t do any such thing, I beg of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Why, that is Mr. Chillingworth\'s voice," cried Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and it\'s Mr. Chillingworth\'s person, too," said the doctor, as he\r\nemerged from among some laurel bushes.\r\n\r\n"How is this?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Simply that I made up my mind to keep watch and ward to-night outside\r\nhere, in the hope of catching the vampyre. I got into here by climbing\r\nthe gate."\r\n\r\n"But why did you not let me know?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Because I did not know myself, my young friend, till an hour and a half\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen anything?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. But I fancied I heard something in the park outside the wall."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"What say you, Henry," said Mr. Marchdale, "to descending and taking a\r\nhasty examination of the garden and grounds?"\r\n\r\n"I am willing; but first allow me to speak to George, who otherwise\r\nmight be surprised at our long absence."\r\n\r\nHenry walked rapidly to the bed chamber of Flora, and he said to\r\nGeorge,--\r\n\r\n"Have you any objection to being left alone here for about half an hour,\r\nGeorge, while we make an examination of the garden?"\r\n\r\n"Let me have some weapon and I care not. Remain here while I fetch a\r\nsword from my own room."\r\n\r\nHenry did so, and when George returned with a sword, which he always\r\nkept in his bed-room, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Now go, Henry. I prefer a weapon of this description to pistols much.\r\nDo not be longer gone than necessary."\r\n\r\n"I will not, George, be assured."\r\n\r\nGeorge was then left alone, and Henry returned to the balcony, where Mr.\r\nMarchdale was waiting for him. It was a quicker mode of descending to\r\nthe garden to do so by clambering over the balcony than any other, and\r\nthe height was not considerable enough to make it very objectionable, so\r\nHenry and Mr. Marchdale chose that way of joining Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"You are, no doubt, much surprised at finding me here," said the doctor;\r\n"but the fact is, I half made up my mind to come while I was here; but I\r\nhad not thoroughly done so, therefore I said nothing to you about it."\r\n\r\n"We are much indebted to you," said Henry, "for making the attempt."\r\n\r\n"I am prompted to it by a feeling of the strongest curiosity."\r\n\r\n"Are you armed, sir?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"In this stick," said the doctor, "is a sword, the exquisite temper of\r\nwhich I know I can depend upon, and I fully intended to run through any\r\none whom I saw that looked in the least of the vampyre order."\r\n\r\n"You would have done quite right," replied Mr. Marchdale. "I have a\r\nbrace of pistols here, loaded with ball; will you take one, Henry, if\r\nyou please, and then we shall be all armed."\r\n\r\nThus, then, prepared for any exigency, they made the whole round of the\r\nhouse; but found all the fastenings secure, and everything as quiet as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n"Suppose, now, we take a survey of the park outside the garden wall,"\r\nsaid Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to; but before they had proceeded far, Mr. Marchdale\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"There is a ladder lying on the wall; would it not be a good plan to\r\nplace it against the very spot the supposed vampyre jumped over last\r\nnight, and so, from a more elevated position, take a view of the open\r\nmeadows. We could easily drop down on the outer side, if we saw anything\r\nsuspicious."\r\n\r\n"Not a bad plan," said the doctor. "Shall we do it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Henry; and they accordingly carried the ladder, which\r\nhad been used for pruning the trees, towards the spot at the end of the\r\nlong walk, at which the vampyre had made good, after so many fruitless\r\nefforts, his escape from the premises.\r\n\r\nThey made haste down the long vista of trees until they reached the\r\nexact spot, and then they placed the ladder as near as possible, exactly\r\nwhere Henry, in his bewilderment on the evening before, had seen the\r\napparition from the grave spring to.\r\n\r\n"We can ascend singly," said Marchdale; "but there is ample space for us\r\nall there to sit on the top of the wall and make our observations."\r\n\r\nThis was seen to be the case, and in about a couple of minutes they had\r\ntaken up their positions on the wall, and, although the height was but\r\ntrifling, they found that they had a much more extensive view than they\r\ncould have obtained by any other means.\r\n\r\n"To contemplate the beauty of such a night as this," said Mr.\r\nChillingworth, "is amply sufficient compensation for coming the distance\r\nI have."\r\n\r\n"And who knows," remarked Marchdale, "we may yet see something which may\r\nthrow a light upon our present perplexities God knows that I would give\r\nall I can call mine in the world to relieve you and your sister, Henry\r\nBannerworth, from the fearful effect which last night\'s proceedings\r\ncannot fail to have upon you."\r\n\r\n"Of that I am well assured, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry. "If the\r\nhappiness of myself and family depended upon you, we should be happy\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"You are silent, Mr. Chillingworth," remarked Marchdale, after a slight\r\npause.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Mr. Chillingworth--"hush--hush!"\r\n\r\n"Good God, what do you hear?" cried Henry.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laid his hand upon Henry\'s arm as he said,--\r\n\r\n"There is a young lime tree yonder to the right."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"Carry your eye from it in a horizontal line, as near as you can,\r\ntowards the wood."\r\n\r\nHenry did so, and then he uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise, and\r\npointed to a rising spot of ground, which was yet, in consequence of the\r\nnumber of tall trees in its vicinity, partially enveloped in shadow.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I see something," said Marchdale. "By Heaven! it is a human form lying\r\nstretched there."\r\n\r\n"It is--as if in death."\r\n\r\n"What can it be?" said Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"I dread to say," replied Marchdale; "but to my eyes, even at this\r\ndistance, it seems like the form of him we chased last night."\r\n\r\n"The vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes. Look, the moonbeams touch him. Now the shadows of the trees\r\ngradually recede. God of Heaven! the figure moves."\r\n\r\nHenry\'s eyes were riveted to that fearful object, and now a scene\r\npresented itself which filled them all with wonder and astonishment,\r\nmingled with sensations of the greatest awe and alarm.\r\n\r\nAs the moonbeams, in consequence of the luminary rising higher and\r\nhigher in the heavens, came to touch this figure that lay extended on\r\nthe rising ground, a perceptible movement took place in it. The limbs\r\nappeared to tremble, and although it did not rise up, the whole body\r\ngave signs of vitality.\r\n\r\n"The vampyre--the vampyre!" said Mr. Marchdale. "I cannot doubt it now.\r\nWe must have hit him last night with the pistol bullets, and the\r\nmoonbeams are now restoring him to a new life."\r\n\r\nHenry shuddered, and even Mr. Chillingworth turned pale. But he was the\r\nfirst to recover himself sufficiently to propose some course of action,\r\nand he said,--\r\n\r\n"Let us descend and go up to this figure. It is a duty we owe to\r\nourselves as much as to society."\r\n\r\n"Hold a moment," said Mr. Marchdale, as he produced a pistol. "I am an\r\nunerring shot, as you well know, Henry. Before we move from this\r\nposition we now occupy, allow me to try what virtue may be in a bullet\r\nto lay that figure low again."\r\n\r\n"He is rising!" exclaimed Henry.\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale levelled the pistol--he took a sure and deliberate aim,\r\nand then, just as the figure seemed to be struggling to its feet, he\r\nfired, and, with a sudden bound, it fell again.\r\n\r\n"You have hit it," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"You have indeed," exclaimed the doctor. "I think we can go now."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Marchdale--"Hush! Does it not seem to you that, hit it as\r\noften as you will, the moonbeams will recover it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes," said Henry, "they will--they will."\r\n\r\n"I can endure this no longer," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he sprung from\r\nthe wall. "Follow me or not, as you please, I will seek the spot where\r\nthis being lies."\r\n\r\n"Oh, be not rash," cried Marchdale. "See, it rises again, and its form\r\nlooks gigantic."\r\n\r\n"I trust in Heaven and a righteous cause," said the doctor, as he drew\r\nthe sword he had spoken of from the stick, and threw away the scabbard.\r\n"Come with me if you like, or I go alone."\r\n\r\nHenry at once jumped down from the wall, and then Marchdale followed\r\nhim, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Come on; I will not shrink."\r\n\r\nThey ran towards the piece of rising ground; but before they got to it,\r\nthe form rose and made rapidly towards a little wood which was in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the hillock.\r\n\r\n"It is conscious of being pursued," cried the doctor. "See how it\r\nglances back, and then increases its speed."\r\n\r\n"Fire upon it, Henry," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\nHe did so; but either his shot did not take effect, or it was quite\r\nunheeded if it did, by the vampyre, which gained the wood before they\r\ncould have a hope of getting sufficiently near it to effect, or\r\nendeavour to effect, a capture.\r\n\r\n"I cannot follow it there," said Marchdale. "In open country I would\r\nhave pursued it closely; but I cannot follow it into the intricacies of\r\na wood."\r\n\r\n"Pursuit is useless there," said Henry. "It is enveloped in the deepest\r\ngloom."\r\n\r\n"I am not so unreasonable," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, "as to wish you\r\nto follow into such a place as that. I am confounded utterly by this\r\naffair."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Marchdale. "What on earth is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--nothing!" exclaimed Henry, vehemently; "and yet I have,\r\nbeneath the canopy of Heaven, declared that I will, so help me God!\r\nspare neither time nor trouble in the unravelling of this most fearful\r\npiece of business. Did either of you remark the clothing which this\r\nspectral appearance wore?"\r\n\r\n"They were antique clothes," said Mr. Chillingworth, "such as might have\r\nbeen fashionable a hundred years ago, but not now."\r\n\r\n"Such was my impression," added Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"And such my own," said Henry, excitedly. "Is it at all within the\r\ncompass of the wildest belief that what we have seen is a vampyre, and\r\nno other than my ancestor who, a hundred years ago, committed suicide?"\r\n\r\nThere was so much intense excitement, and evidence of mental suffering,\r\nthat Mr. Chillingworth took him by the arm, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Come home--come home; no more of this at present; you will but make\r\nyourself seriously unwell."\r\n\r\n"No--no--no."\r\n\r\n"Come home now, I pray you; you are by far too much excited about this\r\nmatter to pursue it with the calmness which should be brought to bear\r\nupon it."\r\n\r\n"Take advice, Henry," said Marchdale, "take advice, and come home at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"I will yield to you; I feel that I cannot control my own feelings--I\r\nwill yield to you, who, as you say, are cooler on this subject than I\r\ncan be. Oh, Flora, Flora, I have no comfort to bring to you now."\r\n\r\nPoor Henry Bannerworth appeared to be in a complete state of mental\r\nprostration, on account of the distressing circumstances that had\r\noccurred so rapidly and so suddenly in his family, which had had quite\r\nenough to contend with without having superadded to every other evil the\r\nhorror of believing that some preternatural agency was at work to\r\ndestroy every hope of future happiness in this world, under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHe suffered himself to be led home by Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale;\r\nhe no longer attempted to dispute the dreadful fact concerning the\r\nsupposed vampyre; he could not contend now against all the corroborating\r\ncircumstances that seemed to collect together for the purpose of proving\r\nthat which, even when proved, was contrary to all his notions of Heaven,\r\nand at variance with all that was recorded and established is part and\r\nparcel of the system of nature.\r\n\r\n"I cannot deny," he said, when they had reached home, "that such things\r\nare possible; but the probability will not bear a moment\'s\r\ninvestigation."\r\n\r\n"There are more things," said Marchdale, solemnly, "in Heaven, and on\r\nearth, than are dreamed of in our philosophy."\r\n\r\n"There are indeed, it appears," said Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"And are you a convert?" said Henry, turning to him.\r\n\r\n"A convert to what?"\r\n\r\n"To a belief in--in--these vampyres?"\r\n\r\n"I? No, indeed; if you were to shut me up in a room full of vampyres, I\r\nwould tell them all to their teeth that I defied them."\r\n\r\n"But after what we have seen to-night?"\r\n\r\n"What have we seen?"\r\n\r\n"You are yourself a witness."\r\n\r\n"True; I saw a man lying down, and then I saw a man get up; he seemed\r\nthen to be shot, but whether he was or not he only knows; and then I saw\r\nhim walk off in a desperate hurry. Beyond that, I saw nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but, taking such circumstances into combination with others, have\r\nyou not a terrible fear of the truth of the dreadful appearance?"\r\n\r\n"No--no; on my soul, no. I will die in my disbelief of such an outrage\r\nupon Heaven as one of these creatures would most assuredly be."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that I could think like you; but the circumstance strikes too\r\nnearly to my heart."\r\n\r\n"Be of better cheer, Henry--be of better cheer," said Marchdale; "there\r\nis one circumstance which we ought to consider, it is that, from all we\r\nhave seen, there seems to be some things which would favour an opinion,\r\nHenry, that your ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the chamber which was\r\noccupied by Flora, is the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"The dress was the same," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I noted it was."\r\n\r\n"And I."\r\n\r\n"Do you not, then, think it possible that something might be done to set\r\nthat part of the question at rest?"\r\n\r\n"What--what?"\r\n\r\n"Where is your ancestor buried?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I understand you now."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Mr. Chillingworth; "you would propose a visit to his\r\nmansion?"\r\n\r\n"I would," added Marchdale; "anything that may in any way tend to assist\r\nin making this affair clearer, and divesting it of its mysterious\r\ncircumstances, will be most desirable."\r\n\r\nHenry appeared to rouse for some moments and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"He, in common with many other members of the family, no doubt occupies\r\nplace in the vault under the old church in the village."\r\n\r\n"Would it be possible," asked Marchdale, "to get into that vault without\r\nexciting general attention?"\r\n\r\n"It would," said Henry; "the entrance to the vault is in the flooring of\r\nthe pew which belongs to the family in the old church."\r\n\r\n"Then it could be done?" asked Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Most undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"Will you under take such an adventure?" said Mr. Chillingworth. "It may\r\nease your mind."\r\n\r\n"He was buried in the vault, and in his clothes," said Henry, musingly;\r\n"I will think of it. About such a proposition I would not decide\r\nhastily. Give me leave to think of it until to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Most certainly."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey now made their way to the chamber of Flora, and they heard from\r\nGeorge that nothing of an alarming character had occurred to disturb him\r\non his lonely watch. The morning was now again dawning, and Henry\r\nearnestly entreated Mr. Marchdale to go to bed, which he did, leaving\r\nthe two brothers to continue as sentinels by Flora\'s bed side, until the\r\nmorning light should banish all uneasy thoughts.\r\n\r\nHenry related to George what had taken place outside the house, and the\r\ntwo brothers held a long and interesting conversation for some hours\r\nupon that subject, as well as upon others of great importance to their\r\nwelfare. It was not until the sun\'s early rays came glaring in at the\r\ncasement that they both rose, and thought of awakening Flora, who had\r\nnow slept soundly for so many hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY.--THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE\r\nMYSTERIOUS APPARITION\'S APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving thus far, we hope, interested our readers in the fortunes of a\r\nfamily which had become subject to so dreadful a visitation, we trust\r\nthat a few words concerning them, and the peculiar circumstances in\r\nwhich they are now placed, will not prove altogether out of place, or\r\nunacceptable. The Bannerworth family then were well known in the part of\r\nthe country where they resided. Perhaps, if we were to say they were\r\nbetter known by name than they were liked, on account of that name, we\r\nshould be near the truth, for it had unfortunately happened that for a\r\nvery considerable time past the head of the family had been the very\r\nworst specimen of it that could be procured. While the junior branches\r\nwere frequently amiable and most intelligent, and such in mind and\r\nmanner as were calculated to inspire goodwill in all who knew them, he\r\nwho held the family property, and who resided in the house now occupied\r\nby Flora and her brothers, was a very so--so sort of character.\r\n\r\nThis state of things, by some strange fatality, had gone on for nearly a\r\nhundred years, and the consequence was what might have been fairly\r\nexpected, namely--that, what with their vices and what with their\r\nextravagances, the successive heads of the Bannerworth family had\r\nsucceeded in so far diminishing the family property that, when it came\r\ninto the hands of Henry Bannerworth, it was of little value, on account\r\nof the numerous encumbrances with which it was saddled.\r\n\r\nThe father of Henry had not been a very brilliant exception to the\r\ngeneral rule, as regarded the head of the family. If he were not quite\r\nso bad as many of his ancestors, that gratifying circumstance was to be\r\naccounted for by the supposition that he was not quite so bold, and that\r\nthe change in habits, manners, and laws, which had taken place in a\r\nhundred years, made it not so easy for even a landed proprietor to play\r\nthe petty tyrant.\r\n\r\nHe had, to get rid of those animal spirits which had prompted many of\r\nhis predecessors to downright crimes, had recourse to the gaming-table,\r\nand, after raising whatever sums he could upon the property which\r\nremained, he naturally, and as might have been fully expected, lost them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe was found lying dead in the garden of the house one day, and by his\r\nside was his pocket-book, on one leaf of which, it was the impression of\r\nthe family, he had endeavoured to write something previous to his\r\ndecease, for he held a pencil firmly in his grasp.\r\n\r\nThe probability was that he had felt himself getting ill, and, being\r\ndesirous of making some communication to his family which pressed\r\nheavily upon his mind, he had attempted to do so, but was stopped by the\r\ntoo rapid approach of the hand of death.\r\n\r\nFor some days previous to his decease, his conduct had been extremely\r\nmysterious. He had announced an intention of leaving England for\r\never--of selling the house and grounds for whatever they would fetch\r\nover and above the sums for which they were mortgaged, and so clearing\r\nhimself of all encumbrances.\r\n\r\nHe had, but a few hours before he was found lying dead, made the\r\nfollowing singular speech to Henry,--\r\n\r\n"Do not regret, Henry, that the old house which has been in our family\r\nso long is about to be parted with. Be assured that, if it is but for\r\nthe first time in my life, I have good and substantial reasons now for\r\nwhat I am about to do. We shall be able to go some other country, and\r\nthere live like princes of the land."\r\n\r\nWhere the means were to come from to live like a prince, unless Mr.\r\nBannerworth had some of the German princes in his eye, no one knew but\r\nhimself, and his sudden death buried with him that most important\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nThere were some words written on the leaf of his pocket-book, but they\r\nwere of by far too indistinct and ambiguous a nature to lead to\r\nanything. They were these:--\r\n\r\n"The money is ----------"\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a long scrawl of the pencil, which seemed to have\r\nbeen occasioned by his sudden decease.\r\n\r\nOf course nothing could be made of these words, except in the way of a\r\ncontradiction as the family lawyer said, rather more facetiously than a\r\nman of law usually speaks, for if he had written "The money is not," he\r\nwould have been somewhere remarkably near the truth.\r\n\r\nHowever, with all his vices he was regretted by his children, who chose\r\nrather to remember him in his best aspect than to dwell upon his faults.\r\n\r\nFor the first time then, within the memory of man, the head of the\r\nfamily of the Bannerworths was a gentleman, in every sense of the word.\r\nBrave, generous, highly educated, and full of many excellent and noble\r\nqualities--for such was Henry, whom we have introduced to our readers\r\nunder such distressing circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd now, people said, that the family property having been all\r\ndissipated and lost, there would take place a change, and that the\r\nBannerworths would have to take to some course of honourable industry\r\nfor a livelihood, and that then they would be as much respected as they\r\nhad before been detested and disliked.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the position which Henry held was now a most precarious one--for\r\none of the amazingly clever acts of his father had been to encumber the\r\nproperty with overwhelming claims, so that when Henry administered to\r\nthe estate, it was doubted almost by his attorney if it were at all\r\ndesirable to do so.\r\n\r\nAn attachment, however, to the old house of his family, had induced the\r\nyoung man to hold possession of it as long as he could, despite any\r\nadverse circumstance which might eventually be connected with it.\r\n\r\nSome weeks, however, only after the decease of his father, and when he\r\nfairly held possession, a sudden and a most unexpected offer came to him\r\nfrom a solicitor in London, of whom he knew nothing, to purchase the\r\nhouse and grounds, for a client of his, who had instructed him so to do,\r\nbut whom he did not mention.\r\n\r\nThe offer made was a liberal one, and beyond the value of the place.\r\nThe lawyer who had conducted Henry\'s affairs for him since his father\'s\r\ndecease, advised him by all means to take it; but after a consultation\r\nwith his mother and sister, and George, they all resolved to hold by\r\ntheir own house as long as they could, and, consequently, he refused the\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nHe was then asked to let the place, and to name his own price for the\r\noccupation of it; but that he would not do: so the negotiation went off\r\naltogether, leaving only, in the minds of the family, much surprise at\r\nthe exceeding eagerness of some one, whom they knew not, to get\r\npossession of the place on any terms.\r\n\r\nThere was another circumstance perhaps which materially aided in\r\nproducing a strong feeling on the minds of the Bannerworths, with regard\r\nto remaining where they were.\r\n\r\nThat circumstance occurred thus: a relation of the family, who was now\r\ndead, and with whom had died all his means, had been in the habit, for\r\nthe last half dozen years of his life, of sending a hundred pounds to\r\nHenry, for the express purpose of enabling him and his brother George\r\nand his sifter Flora to take a little continental or home tour, in the\r\nautumn of the year.\r\n\r\nA more acceptable present, or for a more delightful purpose, to young\r\npeople, could not be found; and, with the quiet, prudent habits of all\r\nthree of them, they contrived to go far and to see much for the sum\r\nwhich was thus handsomely placed at their disposal.\r\n\r\nIn one of those excursions, when among the mountains of Italy, an\r\nadventure occurred which placed the life of Flora in imminent hazard.\r\n\r\nThey were riding along a narrow mountain path, and, her horse slipping,\r\nshe fell over the ledge of a precipice.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, a young man, a stranger to the whole party, who was\r\ntravelling in the vicinity, rushed to the spot, and by his knowledge and\r\nexertions, they felt convinced her preservation was effected.\r\n\r\nHe told her to lie quiet; he encouraged her to hope for immediate\r\nsuccour; and then, with much personal exertion, and at immense risk to\r\nhimself, he reached the ledge of rock on which she lay, and then he\r\nsupported her until the brothers had gone to a neighbouring house,\r\nwhich, bye-the-bye, was two good English miles off, and got assistance.\r\n\r\nThere came on, while they were gone, a terrific storm, and Flora felt\r\nthat but for him who was with her she must have been hurled from the\r\nrock, and perished in an abyss below, which was almost too deep for\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that she was rescued; and he who had, by his\r\nintrepidity, done so much towards saving her, was loaded with the most\r\nsincere and heartfelt acknowledgments by the brothers as well as by\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHe frankly told them that his name was Holland; that he was travelling\r\nfor amusement and instruction, and was by profession an artist.\r\n\r\nHe travelled with them for some time; and it was not at all to be\r\nwondered at, under the circumstances, that an attachment of the\r\ntenderest nature should spring up between him and the beautiful girl,\r\nwho felt that she owed to him her life.\r\n\r\nMutual glances of affection were exchanged between them, and it was\r\narranged that when he returned to England, he should come at once as an\r\nhonoured guest to the house of the family of the Bannerworths.\r\n\r\nAll this was settled satisfactorily with the full knowledge and\r\nacquiescence of the two brothers, who had taken a strange attachment to\r\nthe young Charles Holland, who was indeed in every way likely to\r\npropitiate the good opinion of all who knew him.\r\n\r\nHenry explained to him exactly how they were situated, and told him that\r\nwhen he came he would find a welcome from all, except possibly his\r\nfather, whose wayward temper he could not answer for.\r\n\r\nYoung Holland stated that he was compelled to be away for a term of two\r\nyears, from certain family arrangements he had entered into, and that\r\nthen he would return and hope to meet Flora unchanged as he should be.\r\n\r\nIt happened that this was the last of the continental excursions of the\r\nBannerworths, for, before another year rolled round, the generous\r\nrelative who had supplied them with the means of making such delightful\r\ntrips was no more; and, likewise, the death of the father had occurred\r\nin the manner we have related, so that there was no chance as had been\r\nanticipated and hoped for by Flora, of meeting Charles Holland on the\r\ncontinent again, before his two years of absence from England should be\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, being the state of things, Flora felt reluctant to give\r\nup the house, where he would be sure to come to look for her, and her\r\nhappiness was too dear to Henry to induce him to make any sacrifice of\r\nit to expediency.\r\n\r\nTherefore was it that Bannerworth Hall, as it was sometimes called, was\r\nretained, and fully intended to be retained at all events until after\r\nCharles Holland had made his appearance, and his advice (for he was, by\r\nthe young people, considered as one of the family) taken, with regard to\r\nwhat was advisable to be done.\r\n\r\nWith one exception this was the state of affairs at the hall, and that\r\nexception relates to Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\nHe was a distant relation of Mrs. Bannerworth, and, in early life, had\r\nbeen sincerely and tenderly attached to her. She, however, with the want\r\nof steady reflection of a young girl, as she then was, had, as is\r\ngenerally the case among several admirers, chosen the very worst: that\r\nis, the man who treated her with the most indifference, and who paid her\r\nthe least attention, was of course, thought the most of, and she gave\r\nher hand to him.\r\n\r\nThat man was Mr. Bannerworth. But future experience had made her\r\nthoroughly awake to her former error; and, but for the love she bore her\r\nchildren, who were certainly all that a mother\'s heart could wish, she\r\nwould often have deeply regretted the infatuation which had induced her\r\nto bestow her hand in the quarter she had done so.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after the decease of Mr. Bannerworth, there came one to\r\nthe hall, who desired to see the widow. That one was Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\nIt might have been some slight tenderness towards him which had never\r\nleft her, or it might be the pleasure merely of seeing one whom she had\r\nknown intimately in early life, but, be that as it may, she certainly\r\ngave him a kindly welcome; and he, after consenting to remain for some\r\ntime as a visitor at the hall, won the esteem of the whole family by his\r\nfrank demeanour and cultivated intellect.\r\n\r\nHe had travelled much and seen much, and he had turned to good account\r\nall he had seen, so that not only was Mr. Marchdale a man of sterling\r\nsound sense, but he was a most entertaining companion.\r\n\r\nHis intimate knowledge of many things concerning which they knew little\r\nor nothing; his accurate modes of thought, and a quiet, gentlemanly\r\ndemeanour, such as is rarely to be met with, combined to make him\r\nesteemed by the Bannerworths. He had a small independence of his own,\r\nand being completely alone in the world, for he had neither wife nor\r\nchild, Marchdale owned that he felt a pleasure in residing with the\r\nBannerworths.\r\n\r\nOf course he could not, in decent terms, so far offend them as to offer\r\nto pay for his subsistence, but he took good care that they should\r\nreally be no losers by having him as an inmate, a matter which he could\r\neasily arrange by little presents of one kind and another, all of which\r\nhe managed should be such as were not only ornamental, but actually\r\nspared his kind entertainers some positive expense which otherwise they\r\nmust have gone to.\r\n\r\nWhether or not this amiable piece of manoeuvring was seen through by the\r\nBannerworths it is not our purpose to inquire. If it was seen through,\r\nit could not lower him in their esteem, for it was probably just what\r\nthey themselves would have felt a pleasure in doing under similar\r\ncircumstances, and if they did not observe it, Mr. Marchdale would,\r\nprobably, be all the better pleased.\r\n\r\nSuch then may be considered by our readers as a brief outline of the\r\nstate of affairs among the Bannerworths--a state which was pregnant with\r\nchanges, and which changes were now likely to be rapid and conclusive.\r\n\r\nHow far the feelings of the family towards the ancient house of their\r\nrace would be altered by the appearance at it of so fearful a visitor as\r\na vampyre, we will not stop to inquire, inasmuch as such feelings will\r\ndevelop themselves as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThat the visitation had produced a serious effect upon all the household\r\nwas sufficiently evident, as well among the educated as among the\r\nignorant. On the second morning, Henry received notice to quit his\r\nservice from the three servants he with difficulty had contrived to keep\r\nat the hall. The reason why he received such notice he knew well enough,\r\nand therefore he did not trouble himself to argue about a superstition\r\nto which he felt now himself almost, compelled to give way; for how\r\ncould he say there was no such thing as a vampyre, when he had, with his\r\nown eyes, had the most abundant evidence of the terrible fact?\r\n\r\nHe calmly paid the servants, and allowed them to leave him at once\r\nwithout at all entering into the matter, and, for the time being, some\r\nmen were procured, who, however, came evidently with fear and trembling,\r\nand probably only took the place, on account of not being able, to\r\nprocure any other. The comfort of the household was likely to be\r\ncompletely put an end to, and reasons now for leaving the hall appeared\r\nto be most rapidly accumulating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT TO THE VAULT OF THE BANNERWORTHS, AND ITS UNPLEASANT\r\nRESULT.--THE MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHenry and his brother roused Flora, and after agreeing together that it\r\nwould be highly imprudent to say anything to her of the proceedings of\r\nthe night, they commenced a conversation with her in encouraging and\r\nkindly accents.\r\n\r\n"Well, Flora," said Henry, "you see you have been quite undisturbed\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"I have slept long, dear Henry."\r\n\r\n"You have, and pleasantly too, I hope."\r\n\r\n"I have not had any dreams, and I feel much refreshed, now, and quite\r\nwell again."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" said George.\r\n\r\n"If you will tell dear mother that I am awake, I will get up with her\r\nassistance."\r\n\r\nThe brothers left the room, and they spoke to each other of it as a\r\nfavourable sign, that Flora did not object to being left alone now, as\r\nshe had done on the preceding morning.\r\n\r\n"She is fast recovering, now, George," said Henry. "If we could now but\r\npersuade ourselves that all this alarm would pass away, and that we\r\nshould hear no more of it, we might return to our old and comparatively\r\nhappy condition."\r\n\r\n"Let us believe, Henry, that we shall."\r\n\r\n"And yet, George, I shall not be satisfied in my mind, until I have paid\r\na visit."\r\n\r\n"A visit? Where?"\r\n\r\n"To the family vault."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Henry! I thought you had abandoned that idea."\r\n\r\n"I had. I have several times abandoned it; but it comes across my mind\r\nagain and again."\r\n\r\n"I much regret it."\r\n\r\n"Look you, George; as yet, everything that has happened has tended to\r\nconfirm a belief in this most horrible of all superstitions concerning\r\nvampyres."\r\n\r\n"It has."\r\n\r\n"Now, my great object, George, is to endeavour to disturb such a state\r\nof things, by getting something, however slight, or of a negative\r\ncharacter, for the mind to rest upon on the other side of the question."\r\n\r\n"I comprehend you, Henry."\r\n\r\n"You know that at present we are not only led to believe, almost\r\nirresistibly that we have been visited here by a vampyre but that that\r\nvampyre is our ancestor, whose portrait is on the panel of the wall of\r\nthe chamber into which he contrived to make his way."\r\n\r\n"True, most true."\r\n\r\n"Then let us, by an examination of the family vault, George, put an end\r\nto one of the evidences. If we find, as most surely we shall, the coffin\r\nof the ancestor of ours, who seems, in dress and appearance, so horribly\r\nmixed up in this affair, we shall be at rest on that head."\r\n\r\n"But consider how many years have elapsed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a great number."\r\n\r\n"What then, do you suppose, could remain of any corpse placed in a vault\r\nso long ago?"\r\n\r\n"Decomposition must of course have done its work, but still there must\r\nbe a something to show that a corpse has so undergone the process common\r\nto all nature. Double the lapse of time surely could not obliterate all\r\ntraces of that which had been."\r\n\r\n"There is reason in that, Henry."\r\n\r\n"Besides, the coffins are all of lead, and some of stone, so that they\r\ncannot have all gone."\r\n\r\n"True, most true."\r\n\r\n"If in the one which, from the inscription and the date, we discover to\r\nbe that of our ancestor whom we seek, we find the evident remains of a\r\ncorpse, we shall be satisfied that he has rested in his tomb in peace."\r\n\r\n"Brother, you seem bent on this adventure," said George; "if you go, I\r\nwill accompany you."\r\n\r\n"I will not engage rashly in it, George. Before I finally decide, I will\r\nagain consult with Mr. Marchdale. His opinion will weigh much with me."\r\n\r\n"And in good time, here he comes across the garden," said George, as he\r\nlooked from the window of the room in which they sat.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Marchdale, and the brothers warmly welcomed him as he entered\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\n"You have been early afoot," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I have," he said. "The fact is, that although at your solicitation I\r\nwent to bed, I could not sleep, and I went out once more to search about\r\nthe spot where we had seen the--the I don\'t know what to call it, for I\r\nhave a great dislike to naming it a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"There is not much in a name," said George.\r\n\r\n"In this instance there is," said Marchdale. "It is a name suggestive of\r\nhorror."\r\n\r\n"Made you any discovery?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"None whatever."\r\n\r\n"You saw no trace of any one?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Marchdale, George and I were talking over this projected\r\nvisit to the family vault."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And we agreed to suspend our judgments until we saw you, and learned\r\nyour opinion."\r\n\r\n"Which I will tell you frankly," said Mr. Marchdale, "because I know you\r\ndesire it freely."\r\n\r\n"Do so."\r\n\r\n"It is, that you make the visit."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and for this reason. You have now, as you cannot help having, a\r\ndisagreeable feeling, that you may find that one coffin is untenanted.\r\nNow, if you do find it so, you scarcely make matters worse, by an\r\nadditional confirmation of what already amounts to a strong supposition,\r\nand one which is likely to grow stronger by time."\r\n\r\n"True, most true."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, if you find indubitable proofs that your ancestor has\r\nslept soundly in the tomb, and gone the way of all flesh, you will find\r\nyourselves much calmer, and that an attack is made upon the train of\r\nevents which at present all run one way."\r\n\r\n"That is precisely the argument I was using to George," said Henry, "a\r\nfew moments since."\r\n\r\n"Then let us go," said George, "by all means."\r\n\r\n"It is so decided then," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Let it be done with caution," replied Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"If any one can manage it, of course we can."\r\n\r\n"Why should it not be done secretly and at night? Of course we lose\r\nnothing by making a night visit to a vault into which daylight, I\r\npresume, cannot penetrate."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Then let it be at night."\r\n\r\n"But we shall surely require the concurrence of some of the church\r\nauthorities."\r\n\r\n"Nay, I do not see that," interposed Mr. Marchdale. "It is the vault\r\nactually vested in and belonging to yourself you wish to visit, and,\r\ntherefore, you have right to visit it in any manner or at any time that\r\nmay be most suitable to yourself."\r\n\r\n"But detection in a clandestine visit might produce unpleasant\r\nconsequences."\r\n\r\n"The church is old," said George, "and we could easily find means of\r\ngetting into it. There is only one objection that I see, just now, and\r\nthat is, that we leave Flora unprotected."\r\n\r\n"We do, indeed," said Henry. "I did not think of that."\r\n\r\n"It must be put to herself, as a matter for her own consideration," said\r\nMr. Marchdale, "if she will consider herself sufficiently safe with the\r\ncompany and protection of your mother only."\r\n\r\n"It would be a pity were we not all three present at the examination of\r\nthe coffin," remarked Henry.\r\n\r\n"It would, indeed. There is ample evidence," said Mr. Marchdale, "but we\r\nmust not give Flora a night of sleeplessness and uneasiness on that\r\naccount, and the more particularly as we cannot well explain to her\r\nwhere we are going, or upon what errand."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Let us talk to her, then, about it," said Henry. "I confess I am much\r\nbent upon the plan, and fain would not forego it; neither should I like\r\nother than that we three should go together."\r\n\r\n"If you determine, then, upon it," said Marchdale, "we will go to-night;\r\nand, from your acquaintance with the place, doubtless you will be able\r\nto decide what tools are necessary."\r\n\r\n"There is a trap-door at the bottom of the pew," said Henry; "it is not\r\nonly secured down, but it is locked likewise, and I have the key in my\r\npossession."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; immediately beneath is a short flight of stone steps, which\r\nconduct at once into the vault."\r\n\r\n"Is it large?"\r\n\r\n"No; about the size of a moderate chamber, and with no intricacies about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"There can be no difficulties, then."\r\n\r\n"None whatever, unless we meet with actual personal interruption, which\r\nI am inclined to think is very far from likely. All we shall require\r\nwill be a screwdriver, with which to remove the screws, and then\r\nsomething with which to wrench open the coffin."\r\n\r\n"Those we can easily provide, along with lights," remarked Mr.\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"I hope to Heaven that this visit to the tomb will have the effect of\r\neasing your minds, and enabling you to make a successful stand against\r\nthe streaming torrent of evidence that has poured in upon us regarding\r\nthis most fearful of apparitions."\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed, hope so," added Henry; "and now I will go at once to\r\nFlora, and endeavour to convince her she is safe without us to-night."\r\n\r\n"By-the-bye, I think," said Marchdale, "that if we can induce Mr.\r\nChillingworth to come with us, it will be a great point gained in the\r\ninvestigation."\r\n\r\n"He would," said Henry, "be able to come to an accurate decision with\r\nrespect to the remains--if any--in the coffin, which we could not."\r\n\r\n"Then have him, by all means," said George. "He did not seem averse last\r\nnight to go on such an adventure."\r\n\r\n"I will ask him when he makes his visit this morning upon Flora; and\r\nshould he not feel disposed to join us, I am quite sure he will keep the\r\nsecret of our visit."\r\n\r\nAll this being arranged, Henry proceeded to Flora, and told her that he\r\nand George, and Mr. Marchdale wished to go out for about a couple of\r\nhours in the evening after dark, if she felt sufficiently well to feel a\r\nsense of security without them.\r\n\r\nFlora changed colour, and slightly trembled, and then, as if ashamed of\r\nher fears, she said,--\r\n\r\n"Go, go; I will not detain you. Surely no harm can come to me in\r\npresence of my mother."\r\n\r\n"We shall not be gone longer than the time I mention to you," said\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be quite content. Besides, am I to be kept thus in fear all\r\nmy life? Surely, surely not. I ought, too, to learn to defend myself."\r\n\r\nHenry caught at the idea, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"If fire-arms were left you, do you think you would have courage to use\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"I do, Henry."\r\n\r\n"Then you shall have them; and let me beg of you to shoot any one\r\nwithout the least hesitation who shall come into your chamber."\r\n\r\n"I will, Henry. If ever human being was justified in the use of deadly\r\nweapons, I am now. Heaven protect me from a repetition of the visit to\r\nwhich I have now been once subjected. Rather, oh, much rather would I\r\ndie a hundred deaths than suffer what I have suffered."\r\n\r\n"Do not allow it, dear Flora, to press too heavily upon your mind in\r\ndwelling upon it in conversation. I still entertain a sanguine\r\nexpectation that something may arise to afford a far less dreadful\r\nexplanation of what has occurred than what you have put upon it. Be of\r\ngood cheer, Flora, we shall go one hour after sunset, and return in\r\nabout two hours from the time at which we leave here, you may be\r\nassured."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this ready and courageous acquiescence of Flora in the\r\narrangement, Henry was not without his apprehension that when the night\r\nshould come again, her fears would return with it; but he spoke to Mr.\r\nChillingworth upon the subject, and got that gentleman\'s ready consent\r\nto accompany them.\r\n\r\nHe promised to meet them at the church porch exactly at nine o\'clock,\r\nand matters were all arranged, and Henry waited with much eagerness and\r\nanxiety now for the coming night, which he hoped would dissipate one of\r\nthe fearful deductions which his imagination had drawn from recent\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHe gave to Flora a pair of pistols of his own, upon which he knew he\r\ncould depend, and he took good care to load them well, so that there\r\ncould be no likelihood whatever of their missing fire at a critical\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"Now, Flora," he said, "I have seen you use fire-arms when you were much\r\nyounger than you are now, and therefore I need give you no instructions.\r\nIf any intruder does come, and you do fire, be sure you take a good aim,\r\nand shoot low."\r\n\r\n"I will, Henry, I will; and you will be back in two hours?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly I will."\r\n\r\nThe day wore on, evening came, and then deepened into night. It turned\r\nout to be a cloudy night, and therefore the moon\'s brilliance was\r\nnothing near equal to what it had been on the preceding night Still,\r\nhowever, it had sufficient power over the vapours that frequently\r\ncovered it for many minutes together, to produce a considerable light\r\neffect upon the face of nature, and the night was consequently very far,\r\nindeed, from what might be called a dark one.\r\n\r\nGeorge, Henry, and Marchdale, met in one of the lower rooms of the\r\nhouse, previous to starting upon their expedition; and after satisfying\r\nthemselves that they had with them all the tools that were necessary,\r\ninclusive of the same small, but well-tempered iron crow-bar with which\r\nMarchdale had, on the night of the visit of the vampyre, forced open the\r\ndoor of Flora\'s chamber, they left the hall, and proceeded at a rapid\r\npace towards the church.\r\n\r\n"And Flora does not seem much alarmed," said Marchdale, "at being left\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Henry, "she has made up her mind with a strong natural\r\ncourage which I knew was in her disposition to resist as much as\r\npossible the depressing effects of the awful visitation she has\r\nendured."\r\n\r\n"It would have driven some really mad."\r\n\r\n"It would, indeed; and her own reason tottered on its throne, but, thank\r\nHeaven, she has recovered."\r\n\r\n"And I fervently hope that, through her life," added Marchdale, "she may\r\nnever have such another trial."\r\n\r\n"We will not for a moment believe that such a thing can occur twice."\r\n\r\n"She is one among a thousand. Most young girls would never at all have\r\nrecovered the fearful shock to the nerves."\r\n\r\n"Not only has she recovered," said Henry, "but a spirit, which I am\r\nrejoiced to see, because it is one which will uphold her, of resistance\r\nnow possesses her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she actually--I forgot to tell you before--but she actually asked\r\nme for arms to resist any second visitation."\r\n\r\n"You much surprise me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was surprised, as well as pleased, myself."\r\n\r\n"I would have left her one of my pistols had I been aware of her having\r\nmade such a request. Do you know if she can use fire-arms?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; well."\r\n\r\n"What a pity. I have them both with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she is provided."\r\n\r\n"Provided?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I found some pistols which I used to take with me on the\r\ncontinent, and she has them both well loaded, so that if the vampyre\r\nmakes his appearance, he is likely to meet with rather a warm\r\nreception."\r\n\r\n"Good God! was it not dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, I think."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know best, certainly, of course. I hope the vampyre may come,\r\nand that we may have the pleasure, when we return, of finding him dead.\r\nBy-the-bye, I--I--. Bless me, I have forgot to get the materials for\r\nlights, which I pledged myself to do."\r\n\r\n"How unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Walk on slowly, while I run back and get them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we are too far--"\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" cried a man at this moment, some distance in front of them.\r\n\r\n"It is Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa," cried the worthy doctor again. "Is that you, my friend, Henry\r\nBannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"It is," cried Henry.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth now came up to them and said,--\r\n\r\n"I was before my time, so rather than wait at the church porch, which\r\nwould have exposed me to observation perhaps, I thought it better to\r\nwalk on, and chance meeting with you."\r\n\r\n"You guessed we should come this way?\'\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so it turns out, really. It is unquestionably your most direct\r\nroute to the church."\r\n\r\n"I think I will go back," said Mr Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Back!" exclaimed the doctor; "what for?"\r\n\r\n"I forgot the means of getting lights. We have candles, but no means of\r\nlighting them."\r\n\r\n"Make yourselves easy on that score," said Mr. Chillingworth. "I am\r\nnever without some chemical matches of my own manufacture, so that as\r\nyou have the candles, that can be no bar to our going on a once."\r\n\r\n"That is fortunate," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Very," added Marchdale; "for it seems a mile\'s hard walking for me, or\r\nat least half a mile from the hall. Let us now push on."\r\n\r\nThey did push on, all four walking at a brisk pace. The church, although\r\nit belonged to the village, was not in it. On the contrary, it was\r\nsituated at the end of a long lane, which was a mile nearly from the\r\nvillage, in the direction of the hall, therefore, in going to it from\r\nthe hall, that amount of distance was saved, although it was always\r\ncalled and considered the village church.\r\n\r\nIt stood alone, with the exception of a glebe house and two cottages,\r\nthat were occupied by persons who held situations about the sacred\r\nedifice, and who were supposed, being on the spot, to keep watch and\r\nward over it.\r\n\r\nIt was an ancient building of the early English style of architecture,\r\nor rather Norman, with one of those antique, square, short towers, built\r\nof flint stones firmly embedded in cement, which, from time, had\r\nacquired almost the consistency of stone itself. There were numerous\r\narched windows, partaking something of the more florid gothic style,\r\nalthough scarcely ornamental enough to be called such. The edifice stood\r\nin the centre of a grave-yard, which extended over a space of about half\r\nan acre, and altogether it was one of the prettiest and most rural old\r\nchurches within many miles of the spot.\r\n\r\nMany a lover of the antique and of the picturesque, for it was both,\r\nwent out of his way while travelling in the neighbourhood to look at it,\r\nand it had an extensive and well-deserved reputation as a fine specimen\r\nof its class and style of building.\r\n\r\nIn Kent, to the present day, are some fine specimens of the old Roman\r\nstyle of church, building; and, although they are as rapidly pulled down\r\nas the abuse of modern architects, and the cupidity of speculators, and\r\nthe vanity of clergymen can possibly encourage, in older to erect\r\nflimsy, Italianised structures in their stead, yet sufficient of them\r\nremain dotted over England to interest the traveller. At Walesden there\r\nis a church of this description which will well repay a visit. This,\r\nthen, was the kind of building into which it was the intention of our\r\nfour friends to penetrate, not on an unholy, or an unjustifiable errand,\r\nbut on one which, proceeding from good and proper motives, it was highly\r\ndesirable to conduct in as secret a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nThe moon was more densely covered by clouds than it had yet been that\r\nevening, when they reached the little wicket-gate which led into the\r\nchurchyard, through which was a regularly used thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n"We have a favourable night," remarked Henry, "for we are not so likely\r\nto be disturbed."\r\n\r\n"And now, the question is, how are we to get in?" said Mr.\r\nChillingworth, as he paused, and glanced up at the ancient building.\r\n\r\n"The doors," said George, "would effectually resist us."\r\n\r\n"How can it be done, then?"\r\n\r\n"The only way I can think of," said Henry, "is to get out one of the\r\nsmall diamond-shaped panes of glass from one of the low windows, and\r\nthen we can one of us put in our hands, and undo the fastening, which is\r\nvery simple, when the window opens like a door, and it is but a step\r\ninto the church."\r\n\r\n"A good way," said Marchdale. "We will lose no time."\r\n\r\nThey walked round the church till they came to a very low window indeed,\r\nnear to an angle of the wall, where a huge abutment struck far out into\r\nthe burial-ground.\r\n\r\n"Will you do it, Henry?" said George.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I have often noticed the fastenings. Just give me a slight hoist\r\nup, and all will be right."\r\n\r\nGeorge did so, and Henry with his knife easily bent back some of the\r\nleadwork which held in one of the panes of glass, and then got it out\r\nwhole. He handed it down to George, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Take this, George. We can easily replace it when we leave, so that\r\nthere can be no signs left of any one having been here at all."\r\n\r\nGeorge took the piece of thick, dim-coloured glass, and in another\r\nmoment Henry had succeeded in opening the window, and the mode of\r\ningress to the old church was fair and easy before them all, had there\r\nbeen ever so many.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Marchdale, "that a place so inefficiently protected has\r\nnever been robbed."\r\n\r\n"No wonder at all," remarked Mr. Chillingworth. "There is nothing to\r\ntake that I am aware of that would repay anybody the trouble of taking."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Not an article. The pulpit, to be sure, is covered with faded velvet;\r\nbut beyond that, and an old box, in which I believe nothing is left but\r\nsome books, I think there is no temptation."\r\n\r\n"And that, Heaven knows, is little enough, then."\r\n\r\n"Come on," said Henry. "Be careful; there is nothing beneath the window,\r\nand the depth is about two feet."\r\n\r\nThus guided, they all got fairly into the sacred edifice, and then Henry\r\nclosed the window, and fastened it on the inside as he said,--\r\n\r\n"We have nothing to do now but to set to work opening a way into the\r\nvault, and I trust that Heaven will pardon me for thus desecrating the\r\ntomb of my ancestors, from a consideration of the object I have in view\r\nby so doing."\r\n\r\n"It does seem wrong thus to tamper with the secrets of the tomb,"\r\nremarked Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"The secrets of a fiddlestick!" said the doctor. "What secrets has the\r\ntomb I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but, my dear sir--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, my dear sir, it is high time that death, which is, then, the\r\ninevitable fate of us all, should be regarded with more philosophic eyes\r\nthan it is. There are no secrets in the tomb but such as may well be\r\nendeavoured to be kept secret."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"There is one which very probably we shall find unpleasantly revealed."\r\n\r\n"Which is that?"\r\n\r\n"The not over pleasant odour of decomposed animal remains--beyond that I\r\nknow of nothing of a secret nature that the tomb can show us."\r\n\r\n"Ah, your profession hardens you to such matters."\r\n\r\n"And a very good thing that it does, or else, if all men were to look\r\nupon a dead body as something almost too dreadful to look upon, and by\r\nfar too horrible to touch, surgery would lose its value, and crime, in\r\nmany instances of the most obnoxious character, would go unpunished."\r\n\r\n"If we have a light here," said Henry, "we shall run the greatest chance\r\nin the world of being seen, for the church has many windows."\r\n\r\n"Do not have one, then, by any means," said Mr. Chillingworth. "A match\r\nheld low down in the pew may enable us to open the vault."\r\n\r\n"That will be the only plan."\r\n\r\nHenry led them to the pew which belonged to his family, and in the floor\r\nof which was the trap door.\r\n\r\n"When was it last opened?" inquired Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"When my father died," said Henry; "some ten months ago now, I should\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"The screws, then, have had ample time to fix themselves with fresh\r\nrust."\r\n\r\n"Here is one of my chemical matches," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he\r\nsuddenly irradiated the pew with a clear and beautiful flame, that\r\nlasted about a minute.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the screws were easily discernible, and the short time that\r\nthe light lasted had enabled Henry to turn the key he had brought with\r\nhim in the lock.\r\n\r\n"I think that without a light now," he said, "I can turn the screws\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Can you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; there are but four."\r\n\r\n"Try it, then."\r\n\r\nHenry did so, and from the screws having very large heads, and being\r\nmade purposely, for the convenience of removal when required, with deep\r\nindentations to receive the screw-driver, he found no difficulty in\r\nfeeling for the proper places, and extracting the screws without any\r\nmore light than was afforded to him from the general whitish aspect of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Chillingworth," he said "another of your matches, if you\r\nplease. I have all the screws so loose that I can pick them up with my\r\nfingers."\r\n\r\n"Here," said the doctor.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the pew was as light as day, and Henry succeeded in\r\ntaking out the few screws, which he placed in his pocket for their\r\ngreater security, since, of course, the intention was to replace\r\neverything exactly as it was found, in order that not the least surmise\r\nshould arise in the mind of any person that the vault had been opened,\r\nand visited for any purpose whatever, secretly or otherwise.\r\n\r\n"Let us descend," said Henry. "There is no further obstacle, my friends.\r\nLet us descend."\r\n\r\n"If any one," remarked George, in a whisper, as they slowly descended\r\nthe stairs which conducted into the vault--"if any one had told me that\r\nI should be descending into a vault for the purpose of ascertaining if a\r\ndead body, which had been nearly a century there, was removed or not,\r\nand had become a vampyre, I should have denounced the idea as one of the\r\nmost absurd that ever entered the brain of a human being."\r\n\r\n"We are the very slaves of circumstances," said Marchdale, "and we never\r\nknow what we may do, or what we may not. What appears to us so\r\nimprobable as to border even upon the impossible at one time, is at\r\nanother the only course of action which appears feasibly open to us to\r\nattempt to pursue."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the vault, the floor of which was composed of flat\r\nred tiles, laid in tolerable order the one beside the other. As Henry\r\nhad stated, the vault was by no means of large extent. Indeed, several\r\nof the apartments for the living, at the hall, were much larger than was\r\nthat one destined for the dead.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was dump and noisome, but not by any means so bad as\r\nmight have been expected, considering the number of months which had\r\nelapsed since last the vault was opened to receive one of its ghastly\r\nand still visitants.\r\n\r\n"Now for one of your lights. Mr. Chillingworth. You say you have the\r\ncandles, I think, Marchdale, although you forgot the matches."\r\n\r\n"I have. They are here."\r\n\r\nMarchdale took from his pocket a parcel which contained several wax\r\ncandles, and when it was opened, a smaller packet fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Why, these are instantaneous matches," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he\r\nlifted the small packet up.\r\n\r\n"They are; and what a fruitless journey I should have had back to the\r\nhall," said Mr. Marchdale, "if you had not been so well provided as you\r\nare with the means of getting a light. These matches, which I thought I\r\nhad not with me, have been, in the hurry of departure, enclosed, you\r\nsee, with the candles. Truly, I should have hunted for them at home in\r\nvain."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth lit the wax candle which was now handed to him by\r\nMarchdale, and in another moment the vault from one end of it to the\r\nother was quite clearly discernible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COFFIN.--THE ABSENCE OF THE DEAD.--THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE, AND\r\nTHE CONSTERNATION OF GEORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey were all silent for a few moments as they looked around them with\r\nnatural feelings of curiosity. Two of that party had of course never\r\nbeen in that vault at all, and the brothers, although they had descended\r\ninto it upon the occasion, nearly a year before, of their father being\r\nplaced in it, still looked upon it with almost as curious eyes as they\r\nwho now had their first sight of it.\r\n\r\nIf a man be at all of a thoughtful or imaginative cast of mind, some\r\ncurious sensations are sure to come over him, upon standing in such a\r\nplace, where he knows around him lie, in the calmness of death, those in\r\nwhose veins have flowed kindred blood to him--who bore the same name,\r\nand who preceded him in the brief drama of his existence, influencing\r\nhis destiny and his position in life probably largely by their actions\r\ncompounded of their virtues and their vices.\r\n\r\nHenry Bannerworth and his brother George were just the kind of persons\r\nto feel strongly such sensations. Both were reflective, imaginative,\r\neducated young men, and, as the light from the wax candle flashed upon\r\ntheir faces, it was evident how deeply they felt the situation in which\r\nthey were placed.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth and Marchdale were silent. They both knew what was\r\npassing in the minds of the brothers, and they had too much delicacy to\r\ninterrupt a train of thought which, although from having no affinity\r\nwith the dead who lay around, they could not share in, yet they\r\nrespected. Henry at length, with a sudden start, seemed to recover\r\nhimself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n"This is a time for action, George," he said, "and not for romantic\r\nthought. Let us proceed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said George, and he advanced a step towards the centre of\r\nthe vault.\r\n\r\n"Can you find out among all these coffins, for there seem to be nearly\r\ntwenty," said Mr. Chillingworth, "which is the one we seek?"\r\n\r\n"I think we may," replied Henry. "Some of the earlier coffins of our\r\nrace, I know, were made of marble, and others of metal, both of which\r\nmaterials, I expect, would withstand the encroaches of time for a\r\nhundred years, at least."\r\n\r\n"Let us examine," said George.\r\n\r\nThere were shelves or niches built into the walls all round, on which\r\nthe coffins were placed, so that there could not be much difficulty in a\r\nminute examination of them all, the one after the other.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they came to look, they found that "decay\'s offensive\r\nfingers" had been more busy than they could have imagined, and that\r\nwhatever they touched of the earlier coffins crumbled into dust before\r\ntheir very fingers.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the inscriptions were quite illegible, and, in others, the\r\nplates that had borne them had fallen on to the floor of the vault, so\r\nthat it was impossible to say to which coffin they belonged.\r\n\r\nOf course, the more recent and fresh-looking coffins they did not\r\nexamine, because they could not have anything to do with the object of\r\nthat melancholy visit.\r\n\r\n"We shall arrive at no conclusion," said George. "All seems to have\r\nrotted away among those coffins where we might expect to find the one\r\nbelonging to Marmaduke Bannerworth, our ancestor."\r\n\r\n"Here is a coffin plate," said Marchdale, taking one from the floor.\r\n\r\nHe handed it to Mr. Chillingworth, who, upon an inspection of it, close\r\nto the light, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"It must have belonged to the coffin you seek."\r\n\r\n"What says it?"\r\n\r\n"Ye mortale remains of Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman. God reste his\r\nsoule. A.D. 1540."\r\n\r\n"It is the plate belonging to his coffin," said Henry, "and now our\r\nsearch is fruitless."\r\n\r\n"It is so, indeed," exclaimed George, "for how can we tell to which of\r\nthe coffins that have lost the plates this one really belongs?"\r\n\r\n"I should not be so hopeless," said Marchdale. "I have, from time to\r\ntime, in the pursuit of antiquarian lore, which I was once fond of,\r\nentered many vaults, and I have always observed that an inner coffin of\r\nmetal was sound and good, while the outer one of wood had rotted away,\r\nand yielded at once to the touch of the first hand that was laid upon\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But, admitting that to be the case," said Henry, "how does that assist\r\nus in the identification of a coffin?"\r\n\r\n"I have always, in my experience, found the name and rank of the\r\ndeceased engraved upon the lid of the inner coffin, as well as being set\r\nforth in a much more perishable manner on the plate which was secured to\r\nthe outer one."\r\n\r\n"He is right," said Mr. Chillingworth. "I wonder we never thought of\r\nthat. If your ancestor was buried in a leaden coffin, there will be no\r\ndifficulty in finding which it is."\r\n\r\nHenry seized the light, and proceeding to one of the coffins, which\r\nseemed to be a mass of decay, he pulled away some of the rotted wood\r\nwork, and then suddenly exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"You are quite right. Here is a firm strong leaden coffin within, which,\r\nalthough quite black, does not otherwise appear to have suffered."\r\n\r\n"What is the inscription on that?" said George.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty the name on the lid was deciphered, but it was found not\r\nto be the coffin of him whom they sought.\r\n\r\n"We can make short work of this," said Marchdale, "by only examining\r\nthose leaden coffins which have lost the plates from off their outer\r\ncases. There do not appear to be many in such a state."\r\n\r\nHe then, with another light, which he lighted from the one that Henry\r\nnow carried, commenced actively assisting in the search, which was\r\ncarried on silently for more than ten minutes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Marchdale cried, in a tone of excitement,--\r\n\r\n"I have found it. It is here."\r\n\r\nThey all immediately surrounded the spot where he was, and then he\r\npointed to the lid of a coffin, which he had been rubbing with his\r\nhandkerchief, in order to make the inscription more legible, and said,--\r\n\r\n"See. It is here."\r\n\r\nBy the combined light of the candles they saw the words,--\r\n\r\n"Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman, 1640."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there can be no mistake here," said Henry. "This is the coffin,\r\nand it shall be opened."\r\n\r\n"I have the iron crowbar here," said Marchdale. "It is an old friend of\r\nmine, and I am accustomed to the use of it. Shall I open the coffin?"\r\n\r\n"Do so--do so," said Henry.\r\n\r\nThey stood around in silence, while Mr. Marchdale, with much care,\r\nproceeded to open the coffin, which seemed of great thickness, and was\r\nof solid lead.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the partial rotting of the metal, in consequence of the\r\ndamps of that place, that made it easier to open the coffin than it\r\notherwise would have been, but certain it was that the top came away\r\nremarkably easily. Indeed, so easily did it come off, that another\r\nsupposition might have been hazarded, namely, that it had never at all\r\nbeen effectually fastened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe few moments that elapsed were ones of very great suspense to every\r\none there present; and it would, indeed, be quite sure to assert, that\r\nall the world was for the time forgotten in the absorbing interest which\r\nappertained to the affair which was in progress.\r\n\r\nThe candles were now both held by Mr. Chillingworth, and they were so\r\nheld as to cast a full and clear light upon the coffin. Now the lid slid\r\noff, and Henry eagerly gazed into the interior.\r\n\r\nThere lay something certainly there, and an audible "Thank God!" escaped\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n"The body is there!" exclaimed George.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Marchdale, "here it is. There is something, and what\r\nelse can it be?"\r\n\r\n"Hold the lights," said Mr. Chillingworth; "hold the lights, some of\r\nyou; let us be quite certain."\r\n\r\nGeorge took the lights, and Mr. Chillingworth, without any hesitation,\r\ndipped his hands at once into the coffin, and took up some fragments of\r\nrags which were there. They were so rotten, that they fell to pieces in\r\nhis grasp, like so many pieces of tinder.\r\n\r\nThere was a death-like pause for some few moments, and then Mr.\r\nChillingworth said, in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"There is not the least vestige of a dead body here."\r\n\r\nHenry gave a deep groan, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chillingworth, can you take upon yourself to say that no corpse has\r\nundergone the process of decomposition in this coffin?"\r\n\r\n"To answer your question exactly, as probably in your hurry you have\r\nworded it," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I cannot take upon myself to say\r\nany such thing; but this I can say, namely, that in this coffin there\r\nare no animal remains, and that it is quite impossible that any corpse\r\nenclosed here could, in any lapse of time, have so utterly and entirely\r\ndisappeared."\r\n\r\n"I am answered," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" exclaimed George, "and has this but added another damning\r\nproof, to those we have already on our minds, of one of the must\r\ndreadful superstitions that ever the mind of man conceived?"\r\n\r\n"It would seem so," said Marchdale, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that I were dead! This is terrible. God of heaven, why are these\r\nthings? Oh, if I were but dead, and so spared the torture of supposing\r\nsuch things possible."\r\n\r\n"Think again, Mr. Chillingworth; I pray you think again," cried\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"If I were to think for the remainder of my existence," he replied, "I\r\ncould come to no other conclusion. It is not a matter of opinion; it is\r\na matter of fact."\r\n\r\n"You are positive, then," said Henry, "that the dead body of Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth is not rested here?"\r\n\r\n"I am positive. Look for yourselves. The lead is but slightly\r\ndiscoloured; it looks tolerably clean and fresh; there is not a vestige\r\nof putrefaction--no bones, no dust even."\r\n\r\nThey did all look for themselves, and the most casual glance was\r\nsufficient to satisfy the most sceptical.\r\n\r\n"All is over," said Henry; "let us now leave this place; and all I can\r\nnow ask of you, my friends, is to lock this dreadful secret deep in your\r\nown hearts."\r\n\r\n"It shall never pass my lips," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Nor mine, you may depend," said the doctor. "I was much in hopes that\r\nthis night\'s work would have had the effect of dissipating, instead of\r\nadding to, the gloomy fancies that now possess you."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" cried George, "can you call them fancies, Mr.\r\nChillingworth?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Have you yet a doubt?"\r\n\r\n"My young friend, I told you from the first, that I would not believe in\r\nyour vampyre; and I tell you now, that if one was to come and lay hold\r\nof me by the throat, as long as I could at all gasp for breath I would\r\ntell him he was a d----d impostor."\r\n\r\n"This is carrying incredulity to the verge of obstinacy."\r\n\r\n"Far beyond it, if you please."\r\n\r\n"You will not be convinced?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"I most decidedly, on this point, will not."\r\n\r\n"Then you are one who would doubt a miracle, if you saw it with your own\r\neyes."\r\n\r\n"I would, because I do not believe in miracles. I should endeavour to\r\nfind some rational and some scientific means of accounting for the\r\nphenomenon, and that\'s the very reason why we have no miracles\r\nnow-a-days, between you and I, and no prophets and saints, and all that\r\nsort of thing."\r\n\r\n"I would rather avoid such observations in such a place as this," said\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"Nay, do not be the moral coward," cried Mr. Chillingworth, "to make\r\nyour opinions, or the expression of them, dependent upon any certain\r\nlocality."\r\n\r\n"I know not what to think," said Henry; "I am bewildered quite. Let us\r\nnow come away."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale replaced the lid of the coffin, and then the little party\r\nmoved towards the staircase. Henry turned before he ascended, and\r\nglanced back into the vault.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he said, "if I could but think there had been some mistake, some\r\nerror of judgment, on which the mind could rest for hope."\r\n\r\n"I deeply regret," said Marchdale, "that I so strenuously advised this\r\nexpedition. I did hope that from it would have resulted much good."\r\n\r\n"And you had every reason so to hope," said Chillingworth. "I advised it\r\nlikewise, and I tell you that its result perfectly astonishes me,\r\nalthough I will not allow myself to embrace at once all the conclusions\r\nto which it would seem to lead me."\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied," said Henry; "I know you both advised me for the best.\r\nThe curse of Heaven seems now to have fallen upon me and my house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense!" said Chillingworth. "What for?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! I know not."\r\n\r\n"Then you may depend that Heaven would never act so oddly. In the first\r\nplace, Heaven don\'t curse anybody; and, in the second, it is too just to\r\ninflict pain where pain is not amply deserved."\r\n\r\nThey ascended the gloomy staircase of the vault. The countenances of\r\nboth George and Henry were very much saddened, and it was quite evident\r\nthat their thoughts were by far too busy to enable them to enter into\r\nany conversation. They did not, and particularly George, seem to hear\r\nall that was said to them. Their intellects seemed almost stunned by the\r\nunexpected circumstance of the disappearance of the body of their\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nAll along they had, although almost unknown to themselves, felt a sort\r\nof conviction that they must find some remains of Marmaduke Bannerworth,\r\nwhich would render the supposition, even in the most superstitious\r\nminds, that he was the vampyre, a thing totally and physically\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBut now the whole question assumed a far more bewildering shape. The\r\nbody was not in its coffin--it had not there quietly slept the long\r\nsleep of death common to humanity. Where was it then? What had become of\r\nit? Where, how, and under what circumstances had it been removed? Had it\r\nitself burst the bands that held it, and hideously stalked forth into\r\nthe world again to make one of its seeming inhabitants, and kept up for\r\na hundred years a dreadful existence by such adventures as it had\r\nconsummated at the hall, where, in the course of ordinary human life, it\r\nhad once lived?\r\n\r\nAll these were questions which irresistibly pressed themselves upon the\r\nconsideration of Henry and his brother. They were awful questions.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, take any sober, sane, thinking, educated man, and show him all\r\nthat they had seen, subject him to all to which they had been subjected,\r\nand say if human reason, and all the arguments that the subtlest brain\r\ncould back it with, would be able to hold out against such a vast\r\naccumulation of horrible evidences, and say--"I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth\'s was the only plan. He would not argue the question.\r\nHe said at once,--\r\n\r\n"I will not believe this thing--upon this point I will yield to no\r\nevidence whatever."\r\n\r\nThat was the only way of disposing of such a question; but there are not\r\nmany who could so dispose of it, and not one so much interested in it as\r\nwere the brothers Bannerworth, who could at all hope to get into such a\r\nstate of mind.\r\n\r\nThe boards were laid carefully down again, and the screws replaced.\r\nHenry found himself unequal to the task, so it was done by Marchdale,\r\nwho took pains to replace everything in the same state in which they had\r\nfound it, even to the laying even the matting at the bottom of the pew.\r\n\r\nThen they extinguished the light, and, with heavy hearts, they all\r\nwalked towards the window, to leave the sacred edifice by the same means\r\nthey had entered it.\r\n\r\n"Shall we replace the pane of glass?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it matters not--it matters not," said Henry, listlessly; "nothing\r\nmatters now. I care not what becomes of me--I am getting weary of a life\r\nwhich now must be one of misery and dread."\r\n\r\n"You must not allow yourself to fall into such a state of mind as this,"\r\nsaid the doctor, "or you will become a patient of mine very quickly."\r\n\r\n"I cannot help it."\r\n\r\n"Well, but be a man. If there are serious evils affecting you, fight out\r\nagainst them the best way you can."\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Come, now, listen to me. We need not, I think, trouble ourselves about\r\nthe pane of glass, so come along."\r\n\r\nHe took the arm of Henry and walked on with him a little in advance of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n"Henry," he said, "the best way, you may depend, of meeting evils, be\r\nthey great or small, is to get up an obstinate feeling of defiance\r\nagainst them. Now, when anything occurs which is uncomfortable to me, I\r\nendeavour to convince myself, and I have no great difficulty in doing\r\nso, that I am a decidedly injured man."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I get very angry, and that gets up a kind of obstinacy, which\r\nmakes me not feel half so much mental misery as would be my portion, if\r\nI were to succumb to the evil, and commence whining over it, as many\r\npeople do, under the pretence of being resigned."\r\n\r\n"But this family affliction of mine transcends anything that anybody\r\nelse ever endured."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that; but it is a view of the subject which, if I were\r\nyou, would only make me more obstinate."\r\n\r\n"What can I do?"\r\n\r\n"In the first place, I would say to myself, \'There may or there may not\r\nbe supernatural beings, who, from some physical derangement of the\r\nordinary nature of things, make themselves obnoxious to living people;\r\nif there are, d--n them! There may be vampyres; and if there are, I defy\r\nthem.\' Let the imagination paint its very worst terrors; let fear do\r\nwhat it will and what it can in peopling the mind with horrors. Shrink\r\nfrom nothing, and even then I would defy them all."\r\n\r\n"Is not that like defying Heaven?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly not; for in all we say and in all we do we act from the\r\nimpulses of that mind which is given to us by Heaven itself. If Heaven\r\ncreates an intellect and a mind of a certain order, Heaven will not\r\nquarrel that it does the work which it was adapted to do."\r\n\r\n"I know these are your opinions. I have heard you mention them before."\r\n\r\n"They are the opinions of every rational person. Henry Bannerworth,\r\nbecause they will stand the test of reason; and what I urge upon you is,\r\nnot to allow yourself to be mentally prostrated, even if a vampyre has\r\npaid a visit to your house. Defy him, say I--fight him.\r\nSelf-preservation is a great law of nature, implanted in all our hearts;\r\ndo you summon it to your aid."\r\n\r\n"I will endeavour to think as you would have me. I thought more than\r\nonce of summoning religion to my aid."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is religion."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I consider so, and the most rational religion of all. All that we read\r\nabout religion that does not seem expressly to agree with it, you may\r\nconsider as an allegory."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Chillingworth, I cannot and will not renounce the sublime\r\ntruths of Scripture. They may be incomprehensible; they may be\r\ninconsistent; and some of them may look ridiculous; but still they are\r\nsacred and sublime, and I will not renounce them although my reason may\r\nnot accord with them, because they are the laws of Heaven."\r\n\r\nNo wonder this powerful argument silenced Mr. Chillingworth, who was one\r\nof those characters in society who hold most dreadful opinions, and who\r\nwould destroy religious beliefs, and all the different sects in the\r\nworld, if they could, and endeavour to introduce instead some horrible\r\nsystem of human reason and profound philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut how soon the religious man silences his opponent; and let it not be\r\nsupposed that, because his opponent says no more upon the subject, he\r\ndoes so because he is disgusted with the stupidity of the other; no, it\r\nis because he is completely beaten, and has nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nThe distance now between the church and the hall was nearly traversed,\r\nand Mr. Chillingworth, who was a very good man, notwithstanding his\r\ndisbelief in certain things of course paved the way for him to hell,\r\ntook a kind leave of Mr. Marchdale and the brothers, promising to call\r\non the following morning and see Flora.\r\n\r\nHenry and George then, in earnest conversation with Marchdale, proceeded\r\nhomewards. It was evident that the scene in the vault had made a deep\r\nand saddening impression upon them, and one which was not likely easily\r\nto be eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE OCCURRENCES OF THE NIGHT AT THE HALL.--THE SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE\r\nVAMPYRE, AND THE PISTOL-SHOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDespite the full and free consent which Flora had given to her brothers\r\nto entrust her solely to the care of her mother and her own courage at\r\nthe hall, she felt greater fear creep over her after they were gone than\r\nshe chose to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nA sort of presentiment appeared to come over her that some evil was\r\nabout to occur, and more than once she caught herself almost in the act\r\nof saying,--\r\n\r\n"I wish they had not gone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth, too, could not be supposed to be entirely destitute of\r\nuncomfortable feelings, when she came to consider how poor a guard she\r\nwas over her beautiful child, and how much terror might even deprive of\r\nthe little power she had, should the dreadful visitor again make his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"But it is but for two hours," thought Flora, "and two hours will soon\r\npass away."\r\n\r\nThere was, too, another feeling which gave her some degree of\r\nconfidence, although it arose from a bad source, inasmuch as it was one\r\nwhich showed powerfully how much her mind was dwelling on the\r\nparticulars of the horrible belief in the class of supernatural beings,\r\none of whom she believed had visited her.\r\n\r\nThat consideration was this. The two hours of absence from the hall of\r\nits male inhabitants, would be from nine o\'clock until eleven, and those\r\nwere not the two hours during which she felt that she would be most\r\ntimid on account of the vampyre.\r\n\r\n"It was after midnight before," she thought, "when it came, and perhaps\r\nit may not be able to come earlier. It may not have the power, until\r\nthat time, to make its hideous visits, and, therefore, I will believe\r\nmyself safe."\r\n\r\nShe had made up her mind not to go to bed until the return of her\r\nbrothers, and she and her mother sat in a small room that was used as a\r\nbreakfast-room, and which had a latticed window that opened on to the\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nThis window had in the inside strong oaken shutters, which had been\r\nfastened as securely as their construction would admit of some time\r\nbefore the departure of the brothers and Mr. Marchdale on that\r\nmelancholy expedition, the object of which, if it had been known to her,\r\nwould have added so much to the terrors of poor Flora.\r\n\r\nIt was not even guessed at, however remotely, so that she had not the\r\nadditional affliction of thinking, that while she was sitting there, a\r\nprey to all sorts of imaginative terrors, they were perhaps gathering\r\nfresh evidence, as, indeed, they were, of the dreadful reality of the\r\nappearance which, but for the collateral circumstances attendant upon\r\nits coming and its going, she would fain have persuaded herself was but\r\nthe vision of a dream.\r\n\r\nIt was before nine that the brothers started, but in her own mind Flora\r\ngave them to eleven, and when she heard ten o\'clock sound from a clock\r\nwhich stood in the hall, she felt pleased to think that in another hour\r\nthey would surely be at home.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said her mother, "you look more like yourself, now."\r\n\r\n"Do, I, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are well again."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if I could forget--"\r\n\r\n"Time, my dear Flora, will enable you to do so, and all the fear of what\r\nmade you so unwell will pass away. You will soon forget it all."\r\n\r\n"I will hope to do so."\r\n\r\n"Be assured that, some day or another, something will occur, as Henry\r\nsays, to explain all that has happened, in some way consistent with\r\nreason and the ordinary nature of things, my dear Flora."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will cling to such a belief; I will get Henry, upon whose\r\njudgment I know I can rely, to tell me so, and each time that I hear\r\nsuch words from his lips, I will contrive to dismiss some portion of the\r\nterror which now, I cannot but confess, clings to my heart."\r\n\r\nFlora laid her hand upon her mother\'s arm, and in a low, anxious tone of\r\nvoice, said,--"Listen, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth turned pale, as she said,--"Listen to what, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Within these last ten minutes," said Flora, "I have thought three or\r\nfour times that I heard a slight noise without. Nay, mother, do not\r\ntremble--it may be only fancy."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFlora herself trembled, and was of a death-like paleness; once or twice\r\nshe passed her hand across her brow, and altogether she presented a\r\npicture of much mental suffering.\r\n\r\nThey now conversed in anxious whispers, and almost all they said\r\nconsisted in anxious wishes for the return of the brothers and Mr.\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"You will be happier and more assured, my dear, with some company," said\r\nMrs. Bannerworth. "Shall I ring for the servants, and let them remain in\r\nthe room with us, until they who are our best safeguards next to Heaven\r\nreturn?"\r\n\r\n"Hush--hush--hush, mother!"\r\n\r\n"What do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"I thought--I heard a faint sound."\r\n\r\n"I heard nothing, dear."\r\n\r\n"Listen again, mother. Surely I could not be deceived so often. I have\r\nnow, at least, six times heard a sound as if some one was outside by the\r\nwindows."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my darling, do not think; your imagination is active and in a\r\nstate of excitement."\r\n\r\n"It is, and yet--"\r\n\r\n"Believe me, it deceives you."\r\n\r\n"I hope to Heaven it does!"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some minutes\' duration, and then Mrs. Bannerworth\r\nagain urged slightly the calling of some of the servants, for she\r\nthought that their presence might have the effect of giving a different\r\ndirection to her child\'s thoughts; but Flora saw her place her hand upon\r\nthe bell, and she said,--\r\n\r\n"No, mother, no--not yet, not yet. Perhaps I am deceived."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth upon this sat down, but no sooner had she done so than\r\nshe heartily regretted she had not rung the bell, for, before, another\r\nword could be spoken, there came too perceptibly upon their ears for\r\nthere to be any mistake at all about it, a strange scratching noise upon\r\nthe window outside.\r\n\r\nA faint cry came from Flora\'s lips, as she exclaimed, in a voice of\r\ngreat agony,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!--oh, God! It has come again!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth became faint, and unable to move or speak at all; she\r\ncould only sit like one paralysed, and unable to do more than listen to\r\nand see what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe scratching noise continued for a few seconds, and then altogether\r\nceased. Perhaps, under ordinary circumstances, such a sound outside the\r\nwindow would have scarcely afforded food for comment at all, or, if it\r\nhad, it would have been attributed to some natural effect, or to the\r\nexertions of some bird or animal to obtain admittance to the house.\r\n\r\nBut there had occurred now enough in that family to make any little\r\nsound of wonderful importance, and these things which before would have\r\npassed completely unheeded, at all events without creating much alarm,\r\nwere now invested with a fearful interest.\r\n\r\nWhen the scratching noise ceased, Flora spoke in a low, anxious whisper,\r\nas she said,--\r\n\r\n"Mother, you heard it then?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth tried to speak, but she could not; and then suddenly,\r\nwith a loud clash, the bar, which on the inside appeared to fasten the\r\nshutters strongly, fell as if by some invisible agency, and the shutters\r\nnow, but for the intervention of the window, could be easily pushed open\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth covered her face with her hands, and, after rocking to\r\nand fro for a moment, she fell off her chair, having fainted with the\r\nexcess of terror that came over her.\r\n\r\nFor about the space of time in which a fast speaker could count twelve,\r\nFlora thought her reason was leaving her, but it did not. She found\r\nherself recovering; and there she sat, with her eyes fixed upon the\r\nwindow, looking more like some exquisitely-chiselled statue of despair\r\nthan a being of flesh and blood, expecting each moment to have its eyes\r\nblasted by some horrible appearance, such as might be supposed to drive\r\nher to madness.\r\n\r\nAnd now again came the strange knocking or scratching against the glass\r\nof the window.\r\n\r\nThis continued for some minutes, during which it appeared likewise to\r\nFlora that some confusion was going on at another part of the house, for\r\nshe fancied she heard voices and the banging of doors.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as if she must have sat looking at the shutters of that\r\nwindow a long time before she saw them shake, and then one wide hinged\r\nportion of them slowly opened.\r\n\r\nOnce again horror appeared to be on the point of producing madness in\r\nher brain, and then, as before, a feeling of calmness rapidly ensued.\r\n\r\nShe was able to see plainly that something was by the window, but what\r\nit was she could not plainly discern, in consequence of the lights she\r\nhad in the room. A few moments, however, sufficed to settle that\r\nmystery, for the window was opened and a figure stood before her.\r\n\r\nOne glance, one terrified glance, in which her whole soul was\r\nconcentrated, sufficed to shew her who and what the figure was. There\r\nwas the tall, gaunt form--there was the faded ancient apparel--the\r\nlustrous metallic-looking eyes--its half-opened month, exhibiting the\r\ntusk-like teeth! It was--yes, it was--_the vampyre!_\r\n\r\nIt stood for a moment gazing at her, and then in the hideous way it had\r\nattempted before to speak, it apparently endeavoured to utter some words\r\nwhich it could not make articulate to human ears. The pistols lay before\r\nFlora. Mechanically she raised one, and pointed it at the figure. It\r\nadvanced a step, and then she pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nA stunning report followed. There was a loud cry of pain, and the\r\nvampyre fled. The smoke and the confusion that was incidental to the\r\nspot prevented her from seeing if the figure walked or ran away. She\r\nthought she heard a crashing sound among the plants outside the window,\r\nas if it had fallen, but she did not feel quite sure.\r\n\r\nIt was no effort of any reflection, but a purely mechanical movement,\r\nthat made her raise the other pistol, and discharge that likewise in the\r\ndirection the vampyre had taken. Then casting the weapon away, she rose,\r\nand made a frantic rush from the room. She opened the door, and was\r\ndashing out, when she found herself caught in the circling arms of some\r\none who either had been there waiting, or who had just at that moment\r\ngot there.\r\n\r\nThe thought that it was the vampyre, who by some mysterious means, had\r\ngot there, and was about to make her his prey, now overcame her\r\ncompletely, and she sunk into a state of utter insensibility on the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN FROM THE VAULT.--THE ALARM, AND THE SEARCH AROUND THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt so happened that George and Henry Bannerworth, along with Mr.\r\nMarchdale, had just reached the gate which conducted into the garden of\r\nthe mansion when they all were alarmed by the report of a pistol. Amid\r\nthe stillness of the night, it came upon them with so sudden a shock,\r\nthat they involuntarily paused, and there came from the lips of each an\r\nexpression of alarm.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" cried George, "can that be Flora firing at any\r\nintruder?"\r\n\r\n"It must be," cried Henry; "she has in her possession the only weapons\r\nin the house."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale turned very pale, and trembled slightly, but he did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"On, on," cried Henry; "for God\'s sake, let us hasten on."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he cleared the gate at a bound, and at a terrific pace he\r\nmade towards the house, passing over beds, and plantations, and flowers\r\nheedlessly, so that he went the most direct way to it.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, it was possible for any human speed to accomplish even\r\nhalf of the distance, the report of the other shot came upon his ears,\r\nand he even fancied he heard the bullet whistle past his head in\r\ntolerably close proximity. This supposition gave him a clue to the\r\ndirection at all events from whence the shots proceeded, otherwise he\r\nknew not from which window they were fired, because it had not occurred\r\nto him, previous to leaving home, to inquire in which room Flora and his\r\nmother were likely to be seated waiting his return.\r\n\r\nHe was right as regarded the bullet. It was that winged messenger of\r\ndeath which had passed his head in such very dangerous proximity, and\r\nconsequently he made with tolerable accuracy towards the open window\r\nfrom whence the shots had been fired.\r\n\r\nThe night was not near so dark as it had been, although even yet it was\r\nvery far from being a light one, and he was soon enabled to see that\r\nthere was a room, the window of which was wide open, and lights burning\r\non the table within. He made towards it in a moment, and entered it. To\r\nhis astonishment, the first objects he beheld were Flora and a stranger,\r\nwho was now supporting her in his arms. To grapple him by the throat was\r\nthe work of a moment, but the stranger cried aloud in a voice which\r\nsounded familiar to Harry,--\r\n\r\n"Good God, are you all mad?"\r\n\r\nHenry relaxed his hold, and looked in his face.\r\n\r\n"Gracious heavens, it is Mr. Holland!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; did you not know me?"\r\n\r\nHenry was bewildered. He staggered to a seat, and, in doing so, he saw\r\nhis mother, stretched apparently lifeless upon the floor. To raise her\r\nwas the work of a moment, and then Marchdale and George, who had\r\nfollowed him as fast as they could, appeared at the open window.\r\n\r\nSuch a strange scene as that small room now exhibited had never been\r\nequalled in Bannerworth Hall. There was young Mr. Holland, of whom\r\nmention has already been made, as the affianced lover of Flora,\r\nsupporting her fainting form. There was Henry doing equal service to his\r\nmother; and on the floor lay the two pistols, and one of the candles\r\nwhich had been upset in the confusion; while the terrified attitudes of\r\nGeorge and Mr. Marchdale at the window completed the strange-looking\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n"What is this--oh! what has happened?" cried George.\r\n\r\n"I know not--I know not," said Henry. "Some one summon the servants; I\r\nam nearly mad."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale at once rung the bell, for George looked so faint and ill\r\nas to be incapable of doing so; and he rung it so loudly and so\r\neffectually, that the two servants who had been employed suddenly upon\r\nthe others leaving came with much speed to know what was the matter.\r\n\r\n"See to your mistress," said Henry. "She is dead, or has fainted. For\r\nGod\'s sake, let who can give me some account of what has caused all this\r\nconfusion here."\r\n\r\n"Are you aware, Henry," said Marchdale, "that a stranger is present in\r\nthe room?"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to Mr. Holland as he spoke, who, before Henry could reply,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Sir, I may be a stranger to you, as you are to me, and yet no stranger\r\nto those whose home this is."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Henry, "you are no stranger to us, Mr. Holland, but are\r\nthrice welcome--none can be more welcome. Mr. Marchdale, this is Mr\r\nHolland, of whom you have heard me speak."\r\n\r\n"I am proud to know you, sir," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I thank you," replied Holland, coldly.\r\n\r\nIt will so happen; but, at first sight, it appeared as if those two\r\npersons had some sort of antagonistic feeling towards each other, which\r\nthreatened to prevent effectually their ever becoming intimate friends.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of Henry to the servants to know if they could tell him what\r\nhad occurred was answered in the negative. All they knew was that they\r\nhad heard two shots fired, and that, since then, they had remained where\r\nthey were, in a great fright, until the bell was rung violently. This\r\nwas no news at all and, therefore, the only chance was, to wait\r\npatiently for the recovery of the mother, or of Flora, from one or the\r\nother of whom surely some information could be at once then procured.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth was removed to her own room, and so would Flora have\r\nbeen; but Mr. Holland, who was supporting her in his arms, said,--\r\n\r\n"I think the air from the open window is recovering her, and it is\r\nlikely to do so. Oh, do not now take her from me, after so long an\r\nabsence. Flora, Flora, look up; do you not know me? You have not yet\r\ngiven me one look of acknowledgment. Flora, dear Flora!"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice seemed to act as the most potent of charms in\r\nrestoring her to consciousness; it broke through the death-like trance\r\nin which she lay, and, opening her beautiful eyes, she fixed them upon\r\nhis face, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; it is Charles--it is Charles."\r\n\r\nShe burst into a hysterical flood of tears, and clung to him like some\r\nterrified child to its only friend in the whole wide world.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear friends," cried Charles Holland, "do not deceive me; has\r\nFlora been ill?"\r\n\r\n"We have all been ill," said George.\r\n\r\n"All ill?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and nearly mad," exclaimed Harry.\r\n\r\nHolland looked from one to the other in surprise, as well he might, nor\r\nwas that surprise at all lessened when Flora made an effort to extricate\r\nherself from his embrace, as she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"You must leave me--you must leave me, Charles, for ever! Oh! never,\r\nnever look upon my face again!"\r\n\r\n"I--I am bewildered," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Leave me, now," continued Flora; "think me unworthy; think what you\r\nwill, Charles, but I cannot, I dare not, now be yours."\r\n\r\n"Is this a dream?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, would it were. Charles, if we had never met, you would be\r\nhappier--I could not be more wretched."\r\n\r\n"Flora, Flora, do you say these words of so great cruelty to try my\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"No, as Heaven is my judge, I do not."\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven, then, what do they mean?"\r\n\r\nFlora shuddered, and Henry, coming up to her, took her hand in his\r\ntenderly, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"Has it been again?"\r\n\r\n"It has."\r\n\r\n"You shot it?"\r\n\r\n"I fired full upon it, Henry, but it fled."\r\n\r\n"It did--fly?"\r\n\r\n"It did, Henry, but it will come again--it will be sure to come again."\r\n\r\n"You--you hit it with the bullet?" interposed Mr. Marchdale. "Perhaps\r\nyou killed it?"\r\n\r\n"I think I must have hit it, unless I am mad."\r\n\r\nCharles Holland looked from one to the other with such a look of intense\r\nsurprise, that George remarked it, and said at once to him,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Holland, a full explanation is due to you, and you shall have it."\r\n\r\n"You seem the only rational person here," said Charles. "Pray what is it\r\nthat everybody calls \'_it_?\'"\r\n\r\n"Hush--hush!" said Henry; "you shall hear soon, but not at present."\r\n\r\n"Hear me, Charles," said Flora. "From this moment mind, I do release you\r\nfrom every vow, from every promise made to me of constancy and love; and\r\nif you are wise, Charles, and will be advised, you will now this moment\r\nleave this house never to return to it."\r\n\r\n"No," said Charles--"no; by Heaven I love you, Flora! I have come to say\r\nagain all that in another clime I said with joy to you. When I forget\r\nyou, let what trouble may oppress you, may God forget me, and my own\r\nright hand forget to do me honest service."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Oh! no more--no more!" sobbed Flora.\r\n\r\n"Yes, much more, if you will tell me of words which shall be stronger\r\nthan others in which to paint my love, my faith, and my constancy."\r\n\r\n"Be prudent," said Henry. "Say no more."\r\n\r\n"Nay, upon such a theme I could speak for ever. You may cast me off,\r\nFlora; but until you tell me you love another, I am yours till the\r\ndeath, and then with a sanguine hope at my heart that we shall meet\r\nagain, never, dearest, to part."\r\n\r\nFlora sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she said, "this is the unkindest blow of all--this is worse than\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Unkind!" echoed Holland.\r\n\r\n"Heed her not," said Henry; "she means not you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--no!" she cried. "Farewell, Charles--dear Charles."\r\n\r\n"Oh, say that word again!" he exclaimed, with animation. "It is the\r\nfirst time such music has met my ears."\r\n\r\n"It must be the last."\r\n\r\n"No, no--oh, no."\r\n\r\n"For your own sake I shall be able now, Charles, to show you that I\r\nreally loved you."\r\n\r\n"Not by casting me from you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, even so. That will be the way to show you that I love you."\r\n\r\nShe held up her hands wildly, as she added, in an excited voice,--\r\n\r\n"The curse of destiny is upon me! I am singled out as one lost and\r\naccursed. Oh, horror--horror! would that I were dead!"\r\n\r\nCharles staggered back a pace or two until he came to the table, at\r\nwhich he clutched for support. He turned very pale as he said, in a\r\nfaint voice,--\r\n\r\n"Is--is she mad, or am I?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him I am mad, Henry," cried Flora. "Do not, oh, do not make his\r\nlonely thoughts terrible with more than that. Tell him I am mad."\r\n\r\n"Come with me," whispered Henry to Holland. "I pray you come with me at\r\nonce, and you shall know all."\r\n\r\n"I--will."\r\n\r\n"George, stay with Flora for a time. Come, come, Mr. Holland, you ought,\r\nand you shall know all; then you can come to a judgment for yourself.\r\nThis way, sir. You cannot, in the wildest freak of your imagination,\r\nguess that which I have now to tell you."\r\n\r\nNever was mortal man so utterly bewildered by the events of the last\r\nhour of his existence as was now Charles Holland, and truly he might\r\nwell be so. He had arrived in England, and made what speed he could to\r\nthe house of a family whom he admired for their intelligence, their high\r\nculture, and in one member of which his whole thoughts of domestic\r\nhappiness in this world were centered, and he found nothing but\r\nconfusion, incoherence, mystery, and the wildest dismay.\r\n\r\nWell might he doubt if he were sleeping or waking--well might he ask if\r\nhe or they were mad.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as, after a long, lingering look of affection upon the pale,\r\nsuffering face of Flora, he followed Henry from the room, his thoughts\r\nwere busy in fancying a thousand vague and wild imaginations with\r\nrespect to the communication which was promised to be made to him.\r\n\r\nBut, as Henry had truly said to him, not in the wildest freak of his\r\nimagination could he conceive of any thing near the terrible strangeness\r\nand horror of that which he had to tell him, and consequently he found\r\nhimself closeted with Henry in a small private room, removed from the\r\ndomestic part of the hall, to the full in as bewildered a state as he\r\nhad been from the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS TO THE LOVER.--THE HEART\'S DESPAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nConsternation is sympathetic, and any one who had looked upon the\r\nfeatures of Charles Holland, now that he was seated with Henry\r\nBannerworth, in expectation of a communication which his fears told him\r\nwas to blast all his dearest and most fondly cherished hopes for ever,\r\nwould scarce have recognised in him the same young man who, one short\r\nhour before, had knocked so loudly, and so full of joyful hope and\r\nexpectation, at the door of the hall.\r\n\r\nBut so it was. He knew Henry Bannerworth too well to suppose that any\r\nunreal cause could blanch his cheek. He knew Flora too well to imagine\r\nfor one moment that caprice had dictated the, to him, fearful words of\r\ndismissal she had uttered to him.\r\n\r\nHappier would it at that time have been for Charles Holland had she\r\nacted capriciously towards him, and convinced him that his true heart\'s\r\ndevotion had been cast at the feet of one unworthy of so really noble a\r\ngift. Pride would then have enabled him, no doubt, successfully to\r\nresist the blow. A feeling of honest and proper indignation at having\r\nhis feelings trifled with, would, no doubt, have sustained him, but,\r\nalas! the case seemed widely different.\r\n\r\nTrue, she implored him to think of her no more--no longer to cherish in\r\nhis breast the fond dream of affection which had been its guest so long;\r\nbut the manner in which she did so brought along with it an irresistible\r\nconviction, that she was making a noble sacrifice of her own feelings\r\nfor him, from some cause which was involved in the profoundest mystery.\r\n\r\nBut now he was to hear all. Henry had promised to tell him, and as he\r\nlooked into his pale, but handsomely intellectual face, he half dreaded\r\nthe disclosure he yet panted to hear.\r\n\r\n"Tell me all, Henry--tell me all," he said. "Upon the words that come\r\nfrom your lips I know I can rely."\r\n\r\n"I will have no reservations with you," said Henry, sadly. "You ought to\r\nknow all, and you shall. Prepare yourself for the strangest revelation\r\nyou ever heard."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Ay. One which in hearing you may well doubt; and one which, I hope, you\r\nwill never find an opportunity of verifying."\r\n\r\n"You speak in riddles."\r\n\r\n"And yet speak truly, Charles. You heard with what a frantic vehemence\r\nFlora desired you to think no more of her?"\r\n\r\n"I did--I did."\r\n\r\n"She was right. She is a noble-hearted girl for uttering those words. A\r\ndreadful incident in our family has occurred, which might well induce\r\nyou to pause before uniting your fate with that of any member of it."\r\n\r\n"Impossible. Nothing can possibly subdue the feelings of affection I\r\nentertain for Flora. She is worthy of any one, and, as such, amid all\r\nchanges--all mutations of fortune, she shall be mine."\r\n\r\n"Do not suppose that any change of fortune has produced the scene you\r\nwere witness to."\r\n\r\n"Then, what else?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you, Holland. In all your travels, and in all your reading,\r\ndid you ever come across anything about vampyres?"\r\n\r\n"About what?" cried Charles, drawing his chair forward a little. "About\r\nwhat?"\r\n\r\n"You may well doubt the evidence of your own ears, Charles Holland, and\r\nwish me to repeat what I said. I say, do you know anything about\r\nvampyres?"\r\n\r\nCharles Holland looked curiously in Henry\'s face, and the latter\r\nimmediately added,--\r\n\r\n"I can guess what is passing in your mind at present, and I do not\r\nwonder at it. You think I must be mad."\r\n\r\n"Well, really, Henry, your extraordinary question--"\r\n\r\n"I knew it. Were I you, I should hesitate to believe the tale; but the\r\nfact is, we have every reason to believe that one member of our own\r\nfamily is one of those horrible preternatural beings called vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Good God, Henry, can you allow your judgment for a moment to stoop to\r\nsuch a supposition?"\r\n\r\n"That is what I have asked myself a hundred times; but, Charles Holland,\r\nthe judgment, the feelings, and all the prejudices, natural and\r\nacquired, must succumb to actual ocular demonstration. Listen to me, and\r\ndo not interrupt me. You shall know all, and you shall know it\r\ncircumstantially."\r\n\r\nHenry then related to the astonished Charles Holland all that had\r\noccurred, from the first alarm of Flora, up to that period when he,\r\nHolland, caught her in his arms as she was about to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"And now," he said, in conclusion, "I cannot tell what opinion you may\r\ncome to as regards these most singular events. You will recollect that\r\nhere is the unbiassed evidence of four or five people to the facts, and,\r\nbeyond that, the servants, who have seen something of the horrible\r\nvisitor."\r\n\r\n"You bewilder me, utterly," said Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"As we are all bewildered."\r\n\r\n"But--but, gracious Heaven! it cannot be."\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"No--no. There is--there must be yet some dreadful mistake."\r\n\r\n"Can you start any supposition by which we can otherwise explain any of\r\nthe phenomena I have described to you? If you can, for Heaven\'s sake do\r\nso, and you will find no one who will cling to it with more tenacity\r\nthan I."\r\n\r\n"Any other species or kind of supernatural appearance might admit of\r\nargument; but this, to my perception, is too wildly improbable--too much\r\nat variance with all we see and know of the operations of nature."\r\n\r\n"It is so. All that we have told ourselves repeatedly, and yet is all\r\nhuman reason at once struck down by the few brief words of--\'We have\r\nseen it.\'"\r\n\r\n"I would doubt my eyesight."\r\n\r\n"One might; but many cannot be labouring under the same delusion."\r\n\r\n"My friend, I pray you, do not make me shudder at the supposition that\r\nsuch a dreadful thing as this is at all possible."\r\n\r\n"_I_ am, believe me, Charles, most unwilling to oppress anyone with the\r\nknowledge of these evils; but you are so situated with us, that you\r\nought to know, and you will clearly understand that you may, with\r\nperfect honour, now consider yourself free from all engagements you have\r\nentered into with Flora."\r\n\r\n"No, no! By Heaven, no!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Charles. Reflect upon the consequences now of a union with such a\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Henry Bannerworth, can you suppose me so dead to all good feeling,\r\nso utterly lost to honourable impulses, as to eject from my heart her\r\nwho has possession of it entirely, on such a ground as this?"\r\n\r\n"You would be justified."\r\n\r\n"Coldly justified in prudence I might be. There are a thousand\r\ncircumstances in which a man may be justified in a particular course of\r\naction, and that course yet may be neither honourable nor just. I love\r\nFlora; and were she tormented by the whole of the supernatural world, I\r\nshould still love her. Nay, it becomes, then, a higher and a nobler duty\r\non my part to stand between her and those evils, if possible."\r\n\r\n"Charles--Charles," said Henry, "I cannot of course refuse to you my\r\nmeed of praise and admiration for your generosity of feeling; but,\r\nremember, if we are compelled, despite all our feelings and all our\r\npredilections to the contrary, to give in to a belief in the existence\r\nof vampyres, why may we not at once receive as the truth all that is\r\nrecorded of them?"\r\n\r\n"To what do you allude?"\r\n\r\n"To this. That one who has been visited by a vampyre, and whose blood\r\nhas formed a horrible repast for such a being, becomes, after death, one\r\nof the dreadful race, and visits others in the same way."\r\n\r\n"Now this must be insanity," cried Charles.\r\n\r\n"It bears the aspect of it, indeed," said Henry; "oh, that you could by\r\nsome means satisfy yourself that I am mad."\r\n\r\n"There may be insanity in this family," thought Charles, with such an\r\nexquisite pang of misery, that he groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n"Already," added Henry, mournfully, "already the blighting influence of\r\nthe dreadful tale is upon you, Charles. Oh, let me add my advice to\r\nFlora\'s entreaties. She loves you, and we all esteem you; fly, then,\r\nfrom us, and leave us to encounter our miseries alone. Fly from us,\r\nCharles Holland, and take with you our best wishes for happiness which\r\nyou cannot know here."\r\n\r\n"Never," cried Charles; "I devote my existence to Flora. I will not play\r\nthe coward, and fly from one whom I love, on such grounds. I devote my\r\nlife to her."\r\n\r\nHenry could not speak for emotion for several minutes, and when at\r\nlength, in a faltering voice, he could utter some words, he said,--\r\n\r\n"God of heaven, what happiness is marred by these horrible events? What\r\nhave we all done to be the victims of such a dreadful act of vengeance?"\r\n\r\n"Henry, do not talk in that way," cried Charles. "Rather let us bend all\r\nour energies to overcoming the evil, than spend any time in useless\r\nlamentations. I cannot even yet give in to a belief in the existence of\r\nsuch a being as you say visited Flora."\r\n\r\n"But the evidences."\r\n\r\n"Look you here, Henry: until I am convinced that some things have\r\nhappened which it is totally impossible could happen by any human means\r\nwhatever, I will not ascribe them to supernatural influence."\r\n\r\n"But what human means, Charles, could produce what I have now narrated\r\nto you?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know, just at present, but I will give the subject the most\r\nattentive consideration. Will you accommodate me here for a time?"\r\n\r\n"You know you are as welcome here as if the house were your own, and all\r\nthat it contains."\r\n\r\n"I believe so, most truly. You have no objection, I presume, to my\r\nconversing with Flora upon this strange subject?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. Of course you will be careful to say nothing which can\r\nadd to her fears."\r\n\r\n"I shall be most guarded, believe me. You say that your brother George,\r\nMr. Chillingworth, yourself, and this Mr. Marchdale, have all been\r\ncognisant of the circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"Then with the whole of them you permit me to hold free communication\r\nupon the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly."\r\n\r\n"I will do so then. Keep up good heart, Henry, and this affair, which\r\nlooks so full of terror at first sight, may yet be divested of some of\r\nits hideous aspect."\r\n\r\n"I am rejoiced, if anything can rejoice me now," said Henry, "to see you\r\nview the subject with so much philosophy."\r\n\r\n"Why," said Charles, "you made a remark of your own, which enabled me,\r\nviewing the matter in its very worst and most hideous aspect, to gather\r\nhope."\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\n"You said, properly and naturally enough, that if ever we felt that\r\nthere was such a weight of evidence in favour of a belief in the\r\nexistence of vampyres that we are compelled to succumb to it, we might\r\nas well receive all the popular feelings and superstitions concerning\r\nthem likewise."\r\n\r\n"I did. Where is the mind to pause, when once we open it to the\r\nreception of such things?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if that be the case, we will watch this vampyre and catch\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Catch it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; surely it can be caught; as I understand, this species of being is\r\nnot like an apparition, that may be composed of thin air, and utterly\r\nimpalpable to the human touch, but it consists of a revivified corpse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Then it is tangible and destructible. By Heaven! if ever I catch a\r\nglimpse of any such thing, it shall drag me to its home, be that where\r\nit may, or I will make it prisoner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Charles! you know not the feeling of horror that will come across\r\nyou when you do. You have no idea of how the warm blood will seem to\r\ncurdle in your veins, and how you will be paralysed in every limb."\r\n\r\n"Did you feel so?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"I will endeavour to make head against such feelings. The love of Flora\r\nshall enable me to vanquish them. Think you it will come again\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I can have no thought the one way or the other."\r\n\r\n"It may. We must arrange among us all, Henry, some plan of watching\r\nwhich, without completely prostrating our health and strength, will\r\nalways provide that one shall be up all night and on the alert."\r\n\r\n"It must be done."\r\n\r\n"Flora ought to sleep with the consciousness now that she has ever at\r\nhand some intrepid and well-armed protector, who is not only himself\r\nprepared to defend her, but who can in a moment give an alarm to us all,\r\nin case of necessity requiring it."\r\n\r\n"It would be a dreadful capture to make to seize a vampyre," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Not at all; it would be a very desirable one. Being a corpse\r\nrevivified, it is capable of complete destruction, so as to render it no\r\nlonger a scourge to any one."\r\n\r\n"Charles, Charles, are you jesting with me, or do you really give any\r\ncredence to the story?"\r\n\r\n"My dear friend, I always make it a rule to take things at their worst,\r\nand then I cannot be disappointed. I am content to reason upon this\r\nmatter as if the fact of the existence of a vampyre were thoroughly\r\nestablished, and then to think upon what is best to be done about it."\r\n\r\n"You are right."\r\n\r\n"If it should turn out then that there is an error in the fact, well and\r\ngood--we are all the better off; but if otherwise, we are prepared, and\r\narmed at all points."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so, then. It strikes me, Charles, that you will be the\r\ncoolest and the calmest among us all on this emergency; but the hour now\r\nwaxes late, I will get them to prepare a chamber for you, and at least\r\nto-night, after what has occurred already, I should think we can be\r\nunder no apprehension."\r\n\r\n"Probably not. But, Henry, if you would allow me to sleep in that room\r\nwhere the portrait hangs of him whom you suppose to be the vampyre, I\r\nshould prefer it."\r\n\r\n"Prefer it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am not one who courts danger for danger\'s sake, but I would\r\nrather occupy that room, to see if the vampyre, who perhaps has a\r\npartiality for it, will pay me a visit."\r\n\r\n"As you please, Charles. You can have the apartment. It is in the same\r\nstate as when occupied by Flora. Nothing has been, I believe, removed\r\nfrom it."\r\n\r\n"You will let me, then, while I remain here, call it my room?"\r\n\r\n"Assuredly."\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was accordingly made to the surprise of all the\r\nhousehold, not one of whom would, indeed, have slept, or attempted to\r\nsleep there for any amount of reward. But Charles Holland had his own\r\nreasons for preferring that chamber, and he was conducted to it in the\r\ncourse of half an hour by Henry, who looked around it with a shudder, as\r\nhe bade his young friend good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCHARLES HOLLAND\'S SAD FEELINGS.--THE PORTRAIT.--THE OCCURRENCE OF THE\r\nNIGHT AT THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles Holland wished to be alone, if ever any human being had wished\r\nfervently to be so. His thoughts were most fearfully oppressive.\r\n\r\nThe communication that had been made to him by Henry Bannerworth, had\r\nabout it too many strange, confirmatory circumstances to enable him to\r\ntreat it, in his own mind, with the disrespect that some mere freak of a\r\ndistracted and weak imagination would, most probably, have received from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe had found Flora in a state of excitement which could arise only from\r\nsome such terrible cause as had been mentioned by her brother, and then\r\nhe was, from an occurrence which certainly never could have entered into\r\nhis calculations, asked to forego the bright dream of happiness which he\r\nhad held so long and so rapturously to his heart.\r\n\r\nHow truly he found that the course of true love ran not smooth; and yet\r\nhow little would any one have suspected that from such a cause as that\r\nwhich now oppressed his mind, any obstruction would arise.\r\n\r\nFlora might have been fickle and false; he might have seen some other\r\nfairer face, which might have enchained his fancy, and woven for him a\r\nnew heart\'s chain; death might have stepped between him and the\r\nrealization of his fondest hopes; loss of fortune might have made the\r\nlove cruel which would have yoked to its distresses a young and\r\nbeautiful girl, reared in the lap of luxury, and who was not, even by\r\nthose who loved her, suffered to feel, even in later years, any of the\r\npinching necessities of the family.\r\n\r\nAll these things were possible--some of them were probable; and yet none\r\nof them had occurred. She loved him still; and he, although he had\r\nlooked on many a fair face, and basked in the sunny smiles of beauty,\r\nhad never for a moment forgotten her faith, or lost his devotion to his\r\nown dear English girl.\r\n\r\nFortune he had enough for both; death had not even threatened to rob him\r\nof the prize of such a noble and faithful heart which he had won. But a\r\nhorrible superstition had arisen, which seemed to place at once an\r\nimpassable abyss between them, and to say to him, in a voice of\r\nthundering denunciation,--\r\n\r\n"Charles Holland, will you have a vampyre for your bride?"\r\n\r\nThe thought was terrific. He paced the gloomy chamber to and fro with\r\nrapid strides, until the idea came across his mind that by so doing he\r\nmight not only be proclaiming to his kind entertainers how much he was\r\nmentally distracted, but he likewise might be seriously distracting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe moment this occurred to him he sat down, and was profoundly still\r\nfor some time. He then glanced at the light which had been given to him,\r\nand he found himself almost unconsciously engaged in a mental\r\ncalculation as to how long it would last him in the night.\r\n\r\nHalf ashamed, then, of such terrors, as such a consideration would seem\r\nto indicate, he was on the point of hastily extinguishing it, when he\r\nhappened to cast his eyes on the now mysterious and highly interesting\r\nportrait in the panel.\r\n\r\nThe picture, as a picture, was well done, whether it was a correct\r\nlikeness or not of the party whom it represented. It was one of those\r\nkind of portraits that seem so life-like, that, as you look at them,\r\nthey seem to return your gaze fully, and even to follow you with their\r\neyes from place to place.\r\n\r\nBy candle-light such an effect is more likely to become striking and\r\nremarkable than by daylight; and now, as Charles Holland shaded his own\r\neyes from the light, so as to cast its full radiance upon the portrait,\r\nhe felt wonderfully interested in its life-like appearance.\r\n\r\n"Here is true skill," he said; "such as I have not before seen. How\r\nstrangely this likeness of a man whom I never saw seems to gaze upon\r\nme."\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, too, he aided the effect, which he justly enough called\r\nlife-like, by a slight movement of the candle, such as any one not\r\nblessed with nerves of iron would be sure to make, and such a movement\r\nmade the face look as if it was inspired with vitality.\r\n\r\nCharles remained looking at the portrait for a considerable period of\r\ntime. He found a kind of fascination in it which prevented him from\r\ndrawing his eyes away from it. It was not fear which induced him to\r\ncontinue gazing on it, but the circumstance that it was a likeness of\r\nthe man who, after death, was supposed to have borrowed so new and so\r\nhideous an existence, combined with its artistic merits, chained him to\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n"I shall now," he said, "know that face again, let me see it where I\r\nmay, or under what circumstances I may. Each feature is now indelibly\r\nfixed upon my memory--I never can mistake it."\r\n\r\nHe turned aside as he uttered these words, and as he did so his eyes\r\nfell upon a part of the ornamental frame which composed the edge of the\r\npanel, and which seemed to him to be of a different colour from the\r\nsurrounding portion.\r\n\r\nCuriosity and increased interest prompted him at once to make a closer\r\ninquiry into the matter; and, by a careful and diligent scrutiny, he was\r\nalmost induced to come to the positive opinion, that it no very distant\r\nperiod in time past, the portrait had been removed from the place it\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nWhen once this idea, even vague and indistinct as it was, in consequence\r\nof the slight grounds he formed it on, had got possession of his mind,\r\nhe felt most anxious to prove its verification or its fallacy.\r\n\r\nHe held the candle in a variety of situations, so that its light fell in\r\ndifferent ways on the picture; and the more he examined it, the more he\r\nfelt convinced that it must have been moved lately.\r\n\r\nIt would appear as if, in its removal, a piece of the old oaken carved\r\nframework of the panel had been accidentally broken off, which caused\r\nthe new look of the fracture, and that this accident, from the nature of\r\nthe broken bit of framing, could have occurred in any other way than\r\nfrom an actual or attempted removal of the picture, he felt was\r\nextremely unlikely.\r\n\r\nHe set down the candle on a chair near at hand, and tried if the panel\r\nwas fast in its place. Upon the very first touch, he felt convinced it\r\nwas not so, and that it easily moved. How to get it out, though,\r\npresented a difficulty, and to get it out was tempting.\r\n\r\n"Who knows," he said to himself, "what may be behind it? This is an old\r\nbaronial sort of hall, and the greater portion of it was, no doubt,\r\nbuilt at a time when the construction of such places as hidden chambers\r\nand intricate staircases were, in all buildings of importance,\r\nconsidered a disiderata."\r\n\r\nThat he should make some discovery behind the portrait, now became an\r\nidea that possessed him strongly, although he certainly had no definite\r\ngrounds for really supposing that he should do so.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the wish was more father to the thought than he, in the partial\r\nstate of excitement he was in, really imagined; but so it was. He felt\r\nconvinced that he should not be satisfied until he had removed that\r\npanel from the wall, and seen what was immediately behind it.\r\n\r\nAfter the panel containing the picture had been placed where it was, it\r\nappeared that pieces of moulding had been inserted all around, which had\r\nhad the effect of keeping it in its place, and it was a fracture of one\r\nof these pieces which had first called Charles Holland\'s attention to\r\nthe probability of the picture having been removed. That he should have\r\nto get two, at least, of the pieces of moulding away, before he could\r\nhope to remove the picture, was to him quite apparent, and he was\r\nconsidering how he should accomplish such a result, when he was suddenly\r\nstartled by a knock at his chamber door.\r\n\r\nUntil that sudden demand for admission at his door came, he scarcely\r\nknew to what a nervous state he had worked himself up. It was an odd\r\nsort of tap--one only--a single tap, as if some one demanded admittance,\r\nand wished to awaken his attention with the least possible chance of\r\ndisturbing any one else.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Charles, for he knew he had not fastened his door; "come\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, but after a moment\'s pause, the same sort of low tap\r\ncame again.\r\n\r\nAgain he cried "come in," but, whoever it was, seemed determined that\r\nthe door should be opened for him, and no movement was made from the\r\noutside. A third time the tap came, and Charles was very close to the\r\ndoor when he heard it, for with a noiseless step he had approached it\r\nintending to open it. The instant this third mysterious demand for\r\nadmission came, he did open it wide. There was no one there! In an\r\ninstant he crossed the threshold into the corridor, which ran right and\r\nleft. A window at one end of it now sent in the moon\'s rays, so that it\r\nwas tolerably light, but he could see no one. Indeed, to look for any\r\none, he felt sure was needless, for he had opened his chamber-door\r\nalmost simultaneously with the last knock for admission.\r\n\r\n"It is strange," he said, as he lingered on the threshold of his room\r\ndoor for some moments; "my imagination could not so completely deceive\r\nme. There was most certainly a demand for admission."\r\n\r\nSlowly, then, he returned to his room again, and closed the door behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"One thing is evident," he said, "that if I am in this apartment to be\r\nsubjected to these annoyances, I shall get no rest, which will soon\r\nexhaust me."\r\n\r\nThis thought was a very provoking one, and the more he thought that he\r\nshould ultimately find a necessity for giving up that chamber he had\r\nhimself asked as a special favour to be allowed to occupy, the more\r\nvexed he became to think what construction might be put upon his conduct\r\nfor so doing.\r\n\r\n"They will all fancy me a coward," he thought, "and that I dare not\r\nsleep here. They may not, of course, say so, but they will think that my\r\nappearing so bold was one of those acts of bravado which I have not\r\ncourage to carry fairly out."\r\n\r\nTaking this view of the matter was just the way to enlist a young man\'s\r\npride in staying, under all circumstances, where he was, and, with a\r\nslight accession of colour, which, even although he was alone, would\r\nvisit his cheeks, Charles Holland said aloud,--\r\n\r\n"I will remain the occupant of this room come what may, happen what may.\r\nNo terrors, real or unsubstantial, shall drive me from it: I will brave\r\nthem all, and remain here to brave them."\r\n\r\nTap came the knock at the door again, and now, with more an air of\r\nvexation than fear, Charles turned again towards it, and listened. Tap\r\nin another minute again succeeded, and much annoyed, he walked close to\r\nthe door, and laid his hand upon the lock, ready to open it at the\r\nprecise moment of another demand for admission being made.\r\n\r\nHe had not to wait long. In about half a minute it came again, and,\r\nsimultaneously with the sound, the door flew open. There was no one to\r\nbe seen; but, as he opened the door, he heard a strange sound in the\r\ncorridor--a sound which scarcely could be called a groan, and scarcely a\r\nsigh, but seemed a compound of both, having the agony of the one\r\ncombined with the sadness of the other. From what direction it came he\r\ncould not at the moment decide, but he called out,--\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there? who\'s there?"\r\n\r\nThe echo of his own voice alone answered him for a few moments, and then\r\nhe heard a door open, and a voice, which he knew to be Henry\'s, cried,--\r\n\r\n"What is it? who speaks?"\r\n\r\n"Henry," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"I fear I have disturbed you."\r\n\r\n"You have been disturbed yourself, or you would not have done so. I\r\nshall be with you in a moment."\r\n\r\nHenry closed his door before Charles Holland could tell him not to come\r\nto him, as he intended to do, for he felt ashamed to have, in a manner\r\nof speaking, summoned assistance for so trifling a cause of alarm as\r\nthat to which he had been subjected. However, he could not go to Henry\'s\r\nchamber to forbid him from coming to his, and, more vexed than before,\r\nhe retired to his room again to await his coming.\r\n\r\nHe left the door open now, so that Henry Bannerworth, when he had got on\r\nsome articles of dress, walked in at once, saying,--\r\n\r\n"What has happened, Charles?"\r\n\r\n"A mere trifle, Henry, concerning which I am ashamed you should have\r\nbeen at all disturbed."\r\n\r\n"Never mind that, I was wakeful."\r\n\r\n"I heard a door open, which kept me listening, but I could not decide\r\nwhich door it was till I heard your voice in the corridor."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was this door; and I opened it twice in consequence of the\r\nrepeated taps for admission that came to it; some one has been knocking\r\nat it, and, when I go to it, lo! I can see nobody."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Such is the case."\r\n\r\n"You surprise me."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to have disturbed you, because, upon such a ground, I\r\ndo not feel that I ought to have done so; and, when I called out in the\r\ncorridor, I assure you it was with no such intention."\r\n\r\n"Do not regret it for a moment," said Henry; "you were quite justified\r\nin making an alarm on such an occasion."\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange enough, but still it may arise from some accidental cause;\r\nadmitting, if we did but know it, of some ready enough explanation."\r\n\r\n"It may, certainly, but, after what has happened already, we may well\r\nsuppose a mysterious connexion between any unusual sight or sound, and\r\nthe fearful ones we have already seen."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we may."\r\n\r\n"How earnestly that strange portrait seems to look upon us, Charles."\r\n\r\n"It does, and I have been examining it carefully. It seems to have been\r\nremoved lately."\r\n\r\n"Removed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think, as far as I can judge, that it has been taken from its\r\nframe; I mean, that the panel on which it is painted has been taken\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"If you touch it you will find it loose, and, upon a close examination,\r\nyou will perceive that a piece of the moulding which holds it in its\r\nplace has been chipped off, which is done in such a place that I think\r\nit could only have arisen during the removal of the picture."\r\n\r\n"You must be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"I cannot, of course, take upon myself, Henry, to say precisely such is\r\nthe case," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"But there is no one here to do so."\r\n\r\n"That I cannot say. Will you permit me and assist me to remove it? I\r\nhave a great curiosity to know what is behind it."\r\n\r\n"If you have, I certainly will do so. We thought of taking it away\r\naltogether, but when Flora left this room the idea was given up as\r\nuseless. Remain here a few moments, and I will endeavour to find\r\nsomething which shall assist us in its removal."\r\n\r\nHenry left the mysterious chamber in order to search in his own for some\r\nmeans of removing the frame-work of the picture, so that the panel would\r\nslip easily out, and while he was gone, Charles Holland continued gazing\r\nupon it with greater interest, if possible, than before.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Henry returned, and although what he had succeeded in\r\nfinding were very inefficient implements for the purpose, yet with this\r\naid the two young men set about the task.\r\n\r\nIt is said, and said truly enough, that "where there is a will there is\r\na way," and although the young men had no tools at all adapted for the\r\npurpose, they did succeed in removing the moulding from the sides of the\r\npanel, and then by a little tapping at one end of it, and using a knife\r\nat a lever at the other end of the panel, they got it fairly out.\r\n\r\nDisappointment was all they got for their pains. On the other side there\r\nwas nothing but a rough wooden wall, against which the finer and more\r\nnicely finished oak panelling of the chamber rested.\r\n\r\n"There is no mystery here," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"None whatever," said Charles, as he tapped the wall with his knuckles,\r\nand found it all hard and sound. "We are foiled."\r\n\r\n"We are indeed."\r\n\r\n"I had a strange presentiment, now," added Charles, "that we should make\r\nsome discovery that would repay us for our trouble. It appears, however,\r\nthat such is not to be the case; for you see nothing presents itself to\r\nus but the most ordinary appearances."\r\n\r\n"I perceive as much; and the panel itself, although of more than\r\nordinary thickness, is, after all, but a bit of planed oak, and\r\napparently fashioned for no other object than to paint the portrait on."\r\n\r\n"True. Shall we replace it?"\r\n\r\nCharles reluctantly assented, and the picture was replaced in its\r\noriginal position. We say Charles reluctantly assented, because,\r\nalthough he had now had ocular demonstration that there was really\r\nnothing behind the panel but the ordinary woodwork which might have been\r\nexpected from the construction of the old house, yet he could not, even\r\nwith such a fact staring him in the face, get rid entirely of the\r\nfeeling that had come across him, to the effect that the picture had\r\nsome mystery or another.\r\n\r\n"You are not yet satisfied," said Henry, as he observed the doubtful\r\nlook of Charles Holland\'s face.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Charles, "I will not deceive you. I am much\r\ndisappointed that we have made no discovery behind that picture."\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows we have mysteries enough in our family," said Henry.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke they were both startled by a strange clattering noise\r\nat the window, which was accompanied by a shrill, odd kind of shriek,\r\nwhich sounded fearful and preternatural on the night air.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"God only knows," said Henry.\r\n\r\nThe two young men naturally turned their earnest gaze in the direction\r\nof the window, which we have before remarked was one unprovided with\r\nshutters, and there, to their intense surprise, they saw, slowly rising\r\nup from the lower part of it, what appeared to be a human form. Henry\r\nwould have dashed forward, but Charles restrained him, and drawing\r\nquickly from its case a large holster pistol, he levelled it carefully\r\nat the figure, saying in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n"Henry, if I don\'t hit it, I will consent to forfeit my head."\r\n\r\nHe pulled the trigger--a loud report followed--the room was filled with\r\nsmoke, and then all was still. A circumstance, however, had occurred, as\r\na consequence of the concussion of air produced by the discharge of the\r\npistol, which neither of the young men had for the moment calculated\r\nupon, and that was the putting out of the only light they there had.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this circumstance, Charles, the moment he had discharged the\r\npistol, dropped it and sprung forward to the window. But here he was\r\nperplexed, for he could not find the old fashioned, intricate fastening\r\nwhich held it shut, and he had to call to Henry,--\r\n\r\n"Henry! For God\'s sake open the window for me, Henry! The fastening of\r\nthe window is known to you, but not to me. Open it for me."\r\n\r\nThus called upon, Henry sprung forward, and by this time the report of\r\nthe pistol had effectually alarmed the whole household. The flashing of\r\nlights from the corridor came into the room, and in another minute, just\r\nas Henry succeeded in getting the window wide open, and Charles Holland\r\nhad made his way on to the balcony, both George Bannerworth and Mr.\r\nMarchdale entered the chamber, eager to know what had occurred. To their\r\neager questions Henry replied,--\r\n\r\n"Ask me not now;" and then calling to Charles, he said,--"Remain where\r\nyou are, Charles, while I run down to the garden immediately beneath the\r\nbalcony."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes," said Charles.\r\n\r\nHenry made prodigious haste, and was in the garden immediately below the\r\nbay window in a wonderfully short space of time. He spoke to Charles,\r\nsaying,--\r\n\r\n"Will you now descend? I can see nothing here; but we will both make a\r\nsearch."\r\n\r\nGeorge and Mr. Marchdale were both now in the balcony, and they would\r\nhave descended likewise, but Henry said,--\r\n\r\n"Do not all leave the house. God only knows, now, situated as we are,\r\nwhat might happen."\r\n\r\n"I will remain, then," said George. "I have been sitting up to-night as\r\nthe guard, and, therefore, may as well continue to do so."\r\n\r\nMarchdale and Charles Holland clambered over the balcony, and easily,\r\nfrom its insignificant height, dropped into the garden. The night was\r\nbeautiful, and profoundly still. There was not a breath of air\r\nsufficient to stir a leaf on a tree, and the very flame of the candle\r\nwhich Charles had left burning in the balcony burnt clearly and\r\nsteadily, being perfectly unruffled by any wind.\r\n\r\nIt cast a sufficient light close to the window to make everything very\r\nplainly visible, and it was evident at a glance that no object was\r\nthere, although had that figure, which Charles shot at, and no doubt\r\nhit, been flesh and blood, it must have dropped immediately below.\r\n\r\nAs they looked up for a moment after a cursory examination of the\r\nground, Charles exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Look at the window! As the light is now situated, you can see the hole\r\nmade in one of the panes of glass by the passage of the bullet from my\r\npistol."\r\n\r\nThey did look, and there the clear, round hole, without any starring,\r\nwhich a bullet discharged close to a pane of glass will make in it, was\r\nclearly and plainly discernible.\r\n\r\n"You must have hit him," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"One would think so," said Charles; "for that was the exact place where\r\nthe figure was."\r\n\r\n"And there is nothing here," added Marchdale. "What can we think of\r\nthese events--what resource has the mind against the most dreadful\r\nsuppositions concerning them?"\r\n\r\nCharles and Henry were both silent; in truth, they knew not what to\r\nthink, and the words uttered by Marchdale were too strikingly true to\r\ndispute for a moment. They were lost in wonder.\r\n\r\n"Human means against such an appearance as we saw to-night," said\r\nCharles, "are evidently useless."\r\n\r\n"My dear young friend," said Marchdale, with much emotion, as he grasped\r\nHenry Bannerworth\'s hand, and the tears stood in his eyes as he did\r\nso,--"my dear young friend, these constant alarms will kill you. They\r\nwill drive you, and all whose happiness you hold dear, distracted. You\r\nmust control these dreadful feelings, and there is but one chance that I\r\ncan see of getting now the better of these."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"By leaving this place for ever."\r\n\r\n"Alas! am I to be driven from the home of my ancestors from such a cause\r\nas this? And whither am I to fly? Where are we to find a refuge? To\r\nleave here will be at once to break up the establishment which is now\r\nheld together, certainly upon the sufferance of creditors, but still to\r\ntheir advantage, inasmuch as I am doing what no one else would do,\r\nnamely, paying away to within the scantiest pittance the whole proceeds\r\nof the estate that spreads around me."\r\n\r\n"Heed nothing but an escape from such horrors as seem to be accumulating\r\nnow around you."\r\n\r\n"If I were sure that such a removal would bring with it such a\r\ncorresponding advantage, I might, indeed, be induced to risk all to\r\naccomplish it."\r\n\r\n"As regards poor dear Flora," said Mr. Marchdale, "I know not what to\r\nsay, or what to think; she has been attacked by a vampyre, and after\r\nthis mortal life shall have ended, it is dreadful to think there may be\r\na possibility that she, with all her beauty, all her excellence and\r\npurity of mind, and all those virtues and qualities which should make\r\nher the beloved of all, and which do, indeed, attach all hearts towards\r\nher, should become one of that dreadful tribe of beings who cling to\r\nexistence by feeding, in the most dreadful manner, upon the life blood\r\nof others--oh, it is too dreadful to contemplate! Too horrible--too\r\nhorrible!"\r\n\r\n"Then wherefore speak of it?" said Charles, with some asperity. "Now, by\r\nthe great God of Heaven, who sees all our hearts, I will not give in to\r\nsuch a horrible doctrine! I will not believe it; and were death itself\r\nmy portion for my want of faith, I would this moment die in my disbelief\r\nof anything so truly fearful!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my young friend," added Marchdale, "if anything could add to the\r\npangs which all who love, and admire, and respect Flora Bannerworth must\r\nfeel at the unhappy condition in which she is placed, it would be the\r\nnoble nature of you, who, under happier auspices, would have been her\r\nguide through life, and the happy partner of her destiny."\r\n\r\n"As I will be still."\r\n\r\n"May Heaven forbid it! We are now among ourselves, and can talk freely\r\nupon such a subject. Mr. Charles Holland, if you wed, you would look\r\nforward to being blessed with children--those sweet ties which bind the\r\nsternest hearts to life with so exquisite a bondage. Oh, fancy, then,\r\nfor a moment, the mother of your babes coming at the still hour of\r\nmidnight to drain from their veins the very life blood she gave to them.\r\nTo drive you and them mad with the expected horror of such\r\nvisitations--to make your nights hideous--your days but so many hours of\r\nmelancholy retrospection. Oh, you know not the world of terror, on the\r\nawful brink of which you stand, when you talk of making Flora\r\nBannerworth a wife."\r\n\r\n"Peace! oh, peace!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Nay, I know my words are unwelcome," continued Mr. Marchdale. "It\r\nhappens, unfortunately for human nature, that truth and some of our best\r\nand holiest feelings are too often at variance, and hold a sad\r\ncontest--"\r\n\r\n"I will hear no more of this," cried Charles Holland.--"I will hear no\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"I have done," said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"And \'twere well you had not begun."\r\n\r\n"Nay, say not so. I have but done what I considered was a solemn duty."\r\n\r\n"Under that assumption of doing duty--a solemn duty--heedless of the\r\nfeelings and the opinions of others," said Charles, sarcastically, "more\r\nmischief is produced--more heart-burnings and anxieties caused, than by\r\nany other two causes of such mischievous results combined. I wish to\r\nhear no more of this."\r\n\r\n"Do not be angered with Mr. Marchdale, Charles," said Henry. "He can\r\nhave no motive but our welfare in what he says. We should not condemn a\r\nspeaker because his words may not sound pleasant to our ears."\r\n\r\n"By Heaven!" said Charles, with animation, "I meant not to be illiberal;\r\nbut I will not because I cannot see a man\'s motives for active\r\ninterference in the affairs of others, always be ready, merely on\r\naccount of such ignorance, to jump to a conclusion that they must be\r\nestimable."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, I leave this house," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Leave us?" exclaimed Henry.\r\n\r\n"Ay, for ever."\r\n\r\n"Nay, now, Mr. Marchdale, is this generous?"\r\n\r\n"Am I treated generously by one who is your own guest, and towards whom\r\nI was willing to hold out the honest right hand of friendship?"\r\n\r\nHenry turned to Charles Holland, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Charles, I know your generous nature. Say you meant no offence to my\r\nmother\'s old friend."\r\n\r\n"If to say I meant no offence," said Charles, "is to say I meant no\r\ninsult, I say it freely."\r\n\r\n"Enough," cried Marchdale; "I am satisfied."\r\n\r\n"But do not," added Charles, "draw me any more such pictures as the one\r\nyou have already presented to my imagination, I beg of you. From the\r\nstorehouse of my own fancy I can find quite enough to make me wretched,\r\nif I choose to be so; but again and again do I say I will not allow this\r\nmonstrous superstition to tread me down, like the tread of a giant on a\r\nbroken reed. I will contend against it while I have life to do so."\r\n\r\n"Bravely spoken."\r\n\r\n"And when I desert Flora Bannerworth, may Heaven, from that moment,\r\ndesert me!"\r\n\r\n"Charles!" cried Henry, with emotion, "dear Charles, my more than\r\nfriend--brother of my heart--noble Charles!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Henry, I am not entitled to your praises. I were base indeed to be\r\nother than that which I purpose to be. Come weal or woe--come what may,\r\nI am the affianced husband of your sister, and she, and she only, can\r\nbreak asunder the tie that binds me to her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE OFFER FOR THE HALL.--THE VISIT TO SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.--THE STRANGE\r\nRESEMBLANCE.--A DREADFUL SUGGESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe party made a strict search through every nook and corner of the\r\ngarden, but it proved to be a fruitless one: not the least trace of any\r\none could be found. There was only one circumstance, which was pondered\r\nover deeply by them all, and that was that, beneath the window of the\r\nroom in which Flora and her mother sat while the brothers were on their\r\nvisit to the vault of their ancestors, were visible marks of blood to a\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Flora had fired a pistol at the spectral\r\nappearance, and that immediately upon that it had disappeared, after\r\nuttering a sound which might well be construed into a cry of pain from a\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nThat a wound then had been inflicted upon some one, the blood beneath\r\nthe window now abundantly testified; and when it was discovered, Henry\r\nand Charles made a very close examination indeed of the garden, to\r\ndiscover what direction the wounded figure, be it man or vampyre, had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the closest scrutiny did not reveal to them a single spot of blood,\r\nbeyond the space immediately beneath the window;--there the apparition\r\nseemed to have received its wound, and then, by some mysterious means,\r\nto have disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt length, wearied with the continued excitement, combined with want of\r\nsleep, to which they had been subjected, they returned to the hall.\r\n\r\nFlora, with the exception of the alarm she experienced from the firing\r\nof the pistol, had met with no disturbance, and that, in order to spare\r\nher painful reflections, they told her was merely done as a\r\nprecautionary measure, to proclaim to any one who might be lurking in\r\nthe garden that the inmates of the house were ready to defend themselves\r\nagainst any aggression.\r\n\r\nWhether or not she believed this kind deceit they knew not. She only\r\nsighed deeply, and wept. The probability is, that she more than\r\nsuspected the vampyre had made another visit, but they forbore to press\r\nthe point; and, leaving her with her mother, Henry and George went from\r\nher chamber again--the former to endeavour to seek some repose, as it\r\nwould be his turn to watch on the succeeding night, and the latter to\r\nresume his station in a small room close to Flora\'s chamber, where it\r\nhad been agreed watch and ward should be kept by turns while the alarm\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\nAt length, the morning again dawned upon that unhappy family, and to\r\nnone were its beams more welcome.\r\n\r\nThe birds sang their pleasant carols beneath the window. The sweet,\r\ndeep-coloured autumnal sun shone upon all objects with a golden luster;\r\nand to look abroad, upon the beaming face of nature, no one could for a\r\nmoment suppose, except from sad experience, that there were such things\r\nas gloom, misery, and crime, upon the earth.\r\n\r\n"And must I," said Henry, as he gazed from a window of the hall upon the\r\nundulating park, the majestic trees, the flowers, the shrubs, and the\r\nmany natural beauties with which the place was full,--"must I be chased\r\nfrom this spot, the home of my self and of my kindred, by a\r\nphantom--must I indeed seek refuge elsewhere, because my own home has\r\nbecome hideous?"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a cruel and a painful thought! It was one he yet would\r\nnot, could not be convinced was absolutely necessary. But now the sun\r\nwas shining: it was morning; and the feelings, which found a home in his\r\nbreast amid the darkness, the stillness, and the uncertainty of night,\r\nwere chased away by those glorious beams of sunlight, that fell upon\r\nhill, valley, and stream, and the thousand sweet sounds of life and\r\nanimation that filled that sunny air!\r\n\r\nSuch a revulsion of feeling was natural enough. Many of the distresses\r\nand mental anxieties of night vanish with the night, and those which\r\noppressed the heart of Henry Bannerworth were considerably modified.\r\n\r\nHe was engaged in these reflections when he heard the sound of the lodge\r\nbell, and as a visitor was now somewhat rare at this establishment, he\r\nwaited with some anxiety to see to whom he was indebted for so early a\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few minutes, one of the servants came to him with a\r\nletter in her hand.\r\n\r\nIt bore a large handsome seal, and, from its appearance, would seem to\r\nhave come from some personage of consequence. A second glance at it\r\nshewed him the name of "Varney" in the corner, and, with some degree of\r\nvexation, he muttered to himself,\r\n\r\n"Another condoling epistle from the troublesome neighbour whom I have\r\nnot yet seen."\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir," said the servant who had brought him the letter,\r\n"as I\'m here, and you are here, perhaps you\'ll have no objection to give\r\nme what I\'m to have for the day and two nights as I\'ve been here, cos I\r\ncan\'t stay in a family as is so familiar with all sorts o\' ghostesses: I\r\nain\'t used to such company."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Henry.\r\n\r\nThe question was a superfluous one--: too well he knew what the woman\r\nmeant, and the conviction came across his mind strongly that no domestic\r\nwould consent to live long in a house which was subject to such dreadful\r\nvisitations.\r\n\r\n"What does I mean!" said the woman,--"why, sir, if it\'s all the same to\r\nyou, I don\'t myself come of a wampyre family, and I don\'t choose to\r\nremain in a house where there is sich things encouraged. That\'s what I\r\nmeans, sir."\r\n\r\n"What wages are owing to you?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Why, as to wages, I only comed here by the day."\r\n\r\n"Go, then, and settle with my mother. The sooner you leave this house,\r\nthe better."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed. I\'m sure I don\'t want to stay."\r\n\r\nThis woman was one of those who were always armed at all points for a\r\nrow, and she had no notion of concluding any engagement, of any\r\ncharacter whatever, without some disturbance; therefore, to see Henry\r\ntake what she said with such provoking calmness was aggravating in the\r\nextreme; but there was no help for such a source of vexation. She could\r\nfind no other ground of quarrel than what was connected with the\r\nvampyre, and, as Henry would not quarrel with her on such a score, she\r\nwas compelled to give it up in despair.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry found himself alone, and free from the annoyance of this\r\nwoman, he turned his attention to the letter he held in his hand, and\r\nwhich, from the autograph in the corner, he knew came from his new\r\nneighbour, Sir Francis Varney, whom, by some chance or another, he had\r\nnever yet seen.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise, he found that the letter contained the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir,--"As a neighbour, by purchase of an estate contiguous\r\n     to your own, I am quite sure you have excused, and taken in good\r\n     part, the cordial offer I made to you of friendship and service\r\n     some short time since; but now, in addressing to you a distinct\r\n     proposition, I trust I shall meet with an indulgent\r\n     consideration, whether such proposition be accordant with your\r\n     views or not.\r\n\r\n     "What I have heard from common report induces me to believe that\r\n     Bannerworth Hall cannot be a desirable residence for yourself, or\r\n     your amiable sister. If I am right in that conjecture, and you\r\n     have any serious thought of leaving the place, I would earnestly\r\n     recommend you, as one having some experience in such descriptions\r\n     of property, to sell it at once.\r\n\r\n     "Now, the proposition with which I conclude this letter is, I\r\n     know, of a character to make you doubt the disinterestedness of\r\n     such advice; but that it is disinterested, nevertheless, is a\r\n     fact of which I can assure my own heart, and of which I beg to\r\n     assure you. I propose, then, should you, upon consideration,\r\n     decide upon such a course of proceeding, to purchase of you the\r\n     Hall. I do not ask for a bargain on account of any extraneous\r\n     circumstances which may at the present time depreciate the value\r\n     of the property, but I am willing to give a fair price for it.\r\n     Under these circumstances, I trust, sir, that you will give a\r\n     kindly consideration to my offer, and even if you reject it, I\r\n     hope that, as neighbours, we may live long in peace and amity,\r\n     and in the interchange of those good offices which should subsist\r\n     between us. Awaiting your reply,\r\n\r\n     "Believe me to be, dear sir,\r\n\r\n     "Your very obedient servant,\r\n\r\n     "FRANCIS VARNEY.\r\n\r\n     "To Henry Bannerworth, Esq."\r\n\r\nHenry, after having read this most unobjectionable letter through,\r\nfolded it up again, and placed it in his pocket. Clasping his hands,\r\nthen, behind his back, a favourite attitude of his when he was in deep\r\ncontemplation, he paced to and fro in the garden for some time in deep\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"How strange," he muttered. "It seems that every circumstance combines\r\nto induce me to leave my old ancestral home. It appears as if everything\r\nnow that happened had that direct tendency. What can be the meaning of\r\nall this? \'Tis very strange--amazingly strange. Here arise circumstances\r\nwhich are enough to induce any man to leave a particular place. Then a\r\nfriend, in whose single-mindedness and judgment I know I can rely,\r\nadvises the step, and immediately upon the back of that comes a fair and\r\ncandid offer."\r\n\r\nThere was an apparent connexion between all these circumstances which\r\nmuch puzzled Henry. He walked to and fro for nearly an hour, until he\r\nheard a hasty footstep approaching him, and upon looking in the\r\ndirection from whence it came, he saw Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"I will seek Marchdale\'s advice," he said, "upon this matter. I will\r\nhear what he says concerning it."\r\n\r\n"Henry," said Marchdale, when he came sufficiently near to him for\r\nconversation, "why do you remain here alone?"\r\n\r\n"I have received a communication from our neighbour, Sir Francis\r\nVarney," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"It is here. Peruse it for yourself, and then tell me, Marchdale,\r\ncandidly what you think of it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said Marchdale, as he opened the letter, "it is another\r\nfriendly note of condolence on the state of your domestic affairs,\r\nwhich, I grieve to say, from the prattling of domestics, whose tongues\r\nit is quite impossible to silence, have become food for gossip all over\r\nthe neighbouring villages and estates."\r\n\r\n"If anything could add another pang to those I have already been made to\r\nsuffer," said Henry, "it would certainly arise from being made the food\r\nof vulgar gossip. But read the letter, Marchdale. You will find its\r\ncontents of a more important character than you anticipate."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Marchdale, as he ran his eyes eagerly over the note.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished it he glanced at Henry, who then said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, what is your opinion?"\r\n\r\n"I know not what to say, Henry. You know that my own advice to you has\r\nbeen to get rid of this place."\r\n\r\n"It has."\r\n\r\n"With the hope that the disagreeable affair connected with it now may\r\nremain connected with it as a house, and not with you and yours as a\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"It may be so."\r\n\r\n"There appears to me every likelihood of it."\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Henry, with a shudder. "I must confess, Marchdale,\r\nthat to my own perceptions it seems more probable that the infliction we\r\nhave experienced from the strange visitor, who seems now resolved to\r\npester us with visits, will rather attach to a family than to a house.\r\nThe vampyre may follow us."\r\n\r\n"If so, of course the parting with the Hall would be a great pity, and\r\nno gain."\r\n\r\n"None in the least."\r\n\r\n"Henry, a thought has struck me."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hear it, Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"It is this:--Suppose you were to try the experiment of leaving the Hall\r\nwithout selling it. Suppose for one year you were to let it to some one,\r\nHenry."\r\n\r\n"It might be done."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and it might, with very great promise and candour, be proposed to\r\nthis very gentleman, Sir Francis Varney, to take it for one year, to see\r\nhow he liked it before becoming the possessor of it. Then if he found\r\nhimself tormented by the vampyre, he need not complete the purchase, or\r\nif you found that the apparition followed you from hence, you might\r\nyourself return, feeling that perhaps here, in the spots familiar to\r\nyour youth, you might be most happy, even under such circumstances as at\r\npresent oppress you."\r\n\r\n"Most happy!" ejaculated Henry.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I should not have used that word."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you should not," said Henry, "when you speak of me."\r\n\r\n"Well--well; let us hope that the time may not be very far distant when\r\nI may use the term happy, as applied to you, in the most conclusive and\r\nthe strongest manner it can be used."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Henry, "I will hope; but do not mock me with it now,\r\nMarchdale, I pray you."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid that I should mock you!"\r\n\r\n"Well--well; I do not believe you are the man to do so to any one. But\r\nabout this affair of the house."\r\n\r\n"Distinctly, then, if I were you, I would call upon Sir Francis Varney,\r\nand make him an offer to become a tenant of the Hall for twelve months,\r\nduring which time you could go where you please, and test the fact of\r\nabsence ridding you or not ridding you of the dreadful visitant who\r\nmakes the night here truly hideous."\r\n\r\n"I will speak to my mother, to George, and to my sister of the matter.\r\nThey shall decide."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale now strove in every possible manner to raise the spirits\r\nof Henry Bannerworth, by painting to him the future in far more radiant\r\ncolours than the present, and endeavouring to induce a belief in his\r\nmind that a short period of time might after all replace in his mind,\r\nand in the minds of those who were naturally so dear to him, all their\r\nwonted serenity.\r\n\r\nHenry, although he felt not much comfort from these kindly efforts, yet\r\ncould feel gratitude to him who made them; and after expressing such a\r\nfeeling to Marchdale, in strong terms, he repaired to the house, in\r\norder to hold a solemn consultation with those whom he felt ought to be\r\nconsulted as well as himself as to what steps should be taken with\r\nregard to the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe proposition, or rather the suggestion, which had been made by\r\nMarchdale upon the proposition of Sir Francis Varney, was in every\r\nrespect so reasonable and just, that it met, as was to be expected, with\r\nthe concurrence of every member of the family.\r\n\r\nFlora\'s cheeks almost resumed some of their wonted colour at the mere\r\nthought now of leaving that home to which she had been at one time so\r\nmuch attached.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Henry," she said, "let us leave here if you are agreeable so\r\nto do, and in leaving this house, we will believe that we leave behind\r\nus a world of terror."\r\n\r\n"Flora," remarked Henry, in a tone of slight reproach, "if you were so\r\nanxious to leave Bannerworth Hall, why did you not say so before this\r\nproposition came from other mouths? You know your feelings upon such a\r\nsubject would have been laws to me."\r\n\r\n"I knew you were attached to the old house," said Flora; "and, besides,\r\nevents have come upon us all with such fearful rapidity, there has\r\nscarcely been time to think."\r\n\r\n"True--true."\r\n\r\n"And you will leave, Henry?"\r\n\r\n"I will call upon Sir Francis Varney myself, and speak to him upon the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\nA new impetus to existence appeared now to come over the whole family,\r\nat the idea of leaving a place which always would be now associated in\r\ntheir minds with so much terror. Each member of the family felt happier,\r\nand breathed more freely than before, so that the change which had come\r\nover them seemed almost magical. And Charles Holland, too, was much\r\nbetter pleased, and he whispered to Flora,--\r\n\r\n"Dear Flora, you will now surely no longer talk of driving from you the\r\nhonest heart that loves you?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Charles, hush!" she said; "meet me an hour hence in the garden,\r\nand we will talk of this."\r\n\r\n"That hour will seem an age," he said.\r\n\r\nHenry, now, having made a determination to see Sir Francis Varney, lost\r\nno time in putting it into execution. At Mr. Marchdale\'s own request, he\r\ntook him with him, as it was desirable to have a third person present in\r\nthe sort of business negotiation which was going on. The estate which\r\nhad been so recently entered upon by the person calling himself Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, and which common report said he had purchased, was a\r\nsmall, but complete property, and situated so close to the grounds\r\nconnected with Bannerworth Hall, that a short walk soon placed Henry and\r\nMr. Marchdale before the residence of this gentleman, who had shown so\r\nkindly a feeling towards the Bannerworth family.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Sir Francis Varney?" asked Henry of Mr. Marchdale, as he\r\nrung the gate-bell.\r\n\r\n"I have not. Have you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I never saw him. It is rather awkward our both being absolute\r\nstrangers to his person."\r\n\r\n"We can but send in our names, however; and, from the great vein of\r\ncourtesy that runs through his letter, I have no doubt but we shall\r\nreceive the most gentlemanly reception from him."\r\n\r\nA servant in handsome livery appeared at the iron-gates, which opened\r\nupon a lawn in the front of Sir Francis Varney\'s house, and to this\r\ndomestic Henry Bannerworth handed his card, on which he had written, in\r\npencil, likewise the name of Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"If your master," he said, "is within, we shall be glad to see him."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis is at home, sir," was the reply, "although not very well.\r\nIf you will be pleased to walk in, I will announce you to him."\r\n\r\nHenry and Marchdale followed the man into a handsome enough\r\nreception-room, where they were desired to wait while their names were\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Do you know if this gentleman be a baronet," said Henry, "or a knight\r\nmerely?"\r\n\r\n"I really do not; I never saw him in my life, or heard of him before he\r\ncame into this neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"And I have been too much occupied with the painful occurrences of this\r\nhall to know anything of our neighbours. I dare say Mr. Chillingworth,\r\nif we had thought to ask him, would have known something concerning\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\nThis brief colloquy was put an end to by the servant, who said,--\r\n\r\n"My master, gentlemen, is not very well; but he begs me to present his\r\nbest compliments, and to say he is much gratified with your visit, and\r\nwill be happy to see you in his study."\r\n\r\nHenry and Marchdale followed the man up a flight of stone stairs, and\r\nthen they were conducted through a large apartment into a smaller one.\r\nThere was very little light in this small room; but at the moment of\r\ntheir entrance a tall man, who was seated, rose, and, touching the\r\nspring of a blind that was to the window, it was up in a moment,\r\nadmitting a broad glare of light. A cry of surprise, mingled with\r\nterror, came from Henry Bannerworth\'s lip. _The original of the portrait\r\non the panel stood before him!_ There was the lofty stature, the long,\r\nsallow face, the slightly projecting teeth, the dark, lustrous, although\r\nsomewhat sombre eyes; the expression of the features--all were alike.\r\n\r\n"Are you unwell, sir?" said Sir Francis Varney, in soft, mellow accents,\r\nas he handed a chair to the bewildered Henry.\r\n\r\n"God of Heaven!" said Henry; "how like!"\r\n\r\n"You seem surprised, sir. Have you ever seen me before?"\r\n\r\nSir Francis drew himself up to his full height, and cast a strange\r\nglance upon Henry, whose eyes were rivetted upon his face, as if with a\r\nspecies of fascination which he could not resist.\r\n\r\n"Marchdale," Henry gasped; "Marchdale, my friend, Marchdale. I--I am\r\nsurely mad."\r\n\r\n"Hush! be calm," whispered Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Calm--calm--can you not see? Marchdale, is this a dream?\r\nLook--look--oh! look."\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, Henry, compose yourself."\r\n\r\n"Is your friend often thus?" said Sir Francis Varney, with the same\r\nmellifluous tone which seemed habitual to him.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, he is not; but recent circumstances have shattered his nerves;\r\nand, to tell the truth, you bear so strong a resemblance to an old\r\nportrait, in his house, that I do not wonder so much as I otherwise\r\nshould at his agitation."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"A resemblance!" said Henry; "a resemblance! God of Heaven! it is the\r\nface itself."\r\n\r\n"You much surprise me," said Sir Francis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHenry sunk into the chair which was near him, and he trembled violently.\r\nThe rush of painful thoughts and conjectures that came through his mind\r\nwas enough to make any one tremble. "Is this the vampyre?" was the\r\nhorrible question that seemed impressed upon his very brain, in letters\r\nof flame. "Is this the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"Are you better, sir?" said Sir Francis Varney, in his bland, musical\r\nvoice. "Shall I order any refreshment for you?"\r\n\r\n"No--no," gasped Henry; "for the love of truth tell me! Is--is your name\r\nreally Varney!"\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Have you no other name to which, perhaps, a better title you could\r\nurge?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bannerworth, I can assure you that I am too proud of the name of\r\nthe family to which I belong to exchange it for any other, be it what it\r\nmay."\r\n\r\n"How wonderfully like!"\r\n\r\n"I grieve to see you so much distressed. Mr. Bannerworth. I presume ill\r\nhealth has thus shattered your nerves?"\r\n\r\n"No; ill health has not done the work. I know not what to say, Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, to you; but recent events in my family have made the\r\nsight of you full of horrible conjectures."\r\n\r\n"What mean you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"You know, from common report, that we have had a fearful visitor at our\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"A vampyre, I have heard," said Sir Francis Varney, with a bland, and\r\nalmost beautiful smile, which displayed his white glistening teeth to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a vampyre, and--and--"\r\n\r\n"I pray you go on, sir; you surely are far above the vulgar superstition\r\nof believing in such matters?"\r\n\r\n"My judgment is assailed in too many ways and shapes for it to hold out\r\nprobably as it ought to do against so hideous a belief, but never was it\r\nso much bewildered as now."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Henry," whispered Mr. Marchdale, "it is scarcely civil to tell Sir\r\nFrancis to his face, that he resembles a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I must, I must."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sir," interrupted Varney to Marchdale, "permit Mr. Bannerworth to\r\nspeak here freely. There is nothing in the whole world I so much admire\r\nas candour."\r\n\r\n"Then you so much resemble the vampyre," added Henry, "that--that I know\r\nnot what to think."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" said Varney.\r\n\r\n"It is a damning fact."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s unfortunate for me, I presume? Ah!"\r\n\r\nVarney gave a twinge of pain, as if some sudden bodily ailment had\r\nattacked him severely.\r\n\r\n"You are unwell, sir?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"No, no--no," he said; "I--hurt my arm, and happened accidentally to\r\ntouch the arm of this chair with it."\r\n\r\n"A hurt?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"A--a wound?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a wound, but not much more than skin deep. In fact, little beyond\r\nan abrasion of the skin."\r\n\r\n"May I inquire how you came by it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. A slight fall."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Remarkable, is it not? Very remarkable. We never know a moment when,\r\nfrom same most trifling cause, we may receive really some serious bodily\r\nharm. How true it is, Mr. Bannerworth, that in the midst of life we are\r\nin death."\r\n\r\n"And equally true, perhaps," said Henry, "that in the midst of death\r\nthere may be found a horrible life."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should not wonder. There are really so many strange things in\r\nthis world, that I have left off wondering at anything now."\r\n\r\n"There are strange things," said Henry. "You wish to purchase of me the\r\nHall, sir?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish to sell."\r\n\r\n"You--you are perhaps attached to the place? Perhaps you recollected it,\r\nsir, long ago?"\r\n\r\n"Not very long," smiled Sir Francis Varney. "It seems a nice comfortable\r\nold house; and the grounds, too, appear to be amazingly well wooded,\r\nwhich, to one of rather a romantic temperament like myself, is always an\r\nadditional charm to a place. I was extremely pleased with it the first\r\ntime I beheld it, and a desire to call myself the owner of it took\r\npossession of my mind. The scenery is remarkable for its beauty, and,\r\nfrom what I have seen of it, it is rarely to be excelled. No doubt you\r\nare greatly attached to it."\r\n\r\n"It has been my home from infancy," returned Henry, "and being also the\r\nresidence of my ancestors for centuries, it is natural that I should be\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"True--true."\r\n\r\n"The house, no doubt, has suffered much," said Henry, "within the last\r\nhundred years."\r\n\r\n"No doubt it has. A hundred years is a tolerable long space of time, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed. Oh, how any human life which is spun out to such an\r\nextent, must lose its charms, by losing all its fondest and dearest\r\nassociations."\r\n\r\n"Ah, how true," said Sir Francis Varney. He had some minutes previously\r\ntouched a bell, and at this moment a servant brought in on a tray some\r\nwine and refreshments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHENRY\'S AGREEMENT WITH SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.--THE SUDDEN ARRIVAL AT THE\r\nHALL.--FLORA\'S ALARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the tray which the servant brought into the room, were refreshments\r\nof different kinds, including wine, and after waving his hand for the\r\ndomestic to retire, Sir Francis Varney said,--\r\n\r\n"You will be better, Mr. Bannerworth, for a glass of wine after your\r\nwalk, and you too, sir. I am ashamed to say, I have quite forgotten your\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marchdale. Ay, Marchdale. Pray, sir, help yourself."\r\n\r\n"You take nothing yourself?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I am under a strict regimen," replied Varney. "The simplest diet alone\r\ndoes for me, and I have accustomed myself to long abstinence."\r\n\r\n"He will not eat or drink," muttered Henry, abstractedly.\r\n\r\n"Will you sell me the Hall?" said Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nHenry looked in his face again, from which he had only momentarily\r\nwithdrawn his eyes, and he was then more struck than ever with the\r\nresemblance between him and the portrait on the panel of what had been\r\nFlora\'s chamber. What made that resemblance, too, one about which there\r\ncould scarcely be two opinions, was the mark or cicatrix of a wound in\r\nthe forehead, which the painter had slightly indented in the portrait,\r\nbut which was much more plainly visible on the forehead of Sir Francis\r\nVarney. Now that Henry observed this distinctive mark, which he had not\r\ndone before, he could feel no doubt, and a sickening sensation came over\r\nhim at the thought that he was actually now in the presence of one of\r\nthose terrible creatures, vampyres.\r\n\r\n"You do not drink," said Varney. "Most young men are not so modest with\r\na decanter of unimpeachable wine before them. I pray you help yourself."\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\nHenry rose as he spoke, and turning to Marchdale, he said, in\r\naddition,--\r\n\r\n"Will you come away?"\r\n\r\n"If you please," said Marchdale, rising.\r\n\r\n"But you have not, my dear sir," said Varney, "given me yet any answer\r\nabout the Hall?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot yet," answered Henry, "I will think. My present impression is,\r\nto let you have it on whatever terms you may yourself propose, always\r\nprovided you consent to one of mine."\r\n\r\n"Name it."\r\n\r\n"That you never show yourself in my family."\r\n\r\n"How very unkind. I understand you have a charming sister, young,\r\nbeautiful, and accomplished. Shall I confess, now, that I had hopes of\r\nmaking myself agreeable to her?"\r\n\r\n"You make yourself agreeable to her? The sight of you would blast her\r\nfor ever, and drive her to madness."\r\n\r\n"Am I so hideous?"\r\n\r\n"No, but--you are--"\r\n\r\n"What am I?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Henry, hush," cried Marchdale. "Remember you are in this\r\ngentleman\'s house."\r\n\r\n"True, true. Why does he tempt me to say these dreadful things? I do not\r\nwant to say them."\r\n\r\n"Come away, then--come away at once. Sir Francis Varney, my friend, Mr.\r\nBannerworth, will think over your offer, and let you know. I think you\r\nmay consider that your wish to become the purchaser of the Hall will be\r\ncomplied with."\r\n\r\n"I wish to have it," said Varney, "and I can only say, that if I am\r\nmaster of it, I shall be very happy to see any of the family on a visit\r\nat any time."\r\n\r\n"A visit!" said Henry, with a shudder. "A visit to the tomb were far\r\nmore desirable. Farewell, sir."\r\n\r\n"Adieu," said Sir Francis Varney, and he made one of the most elegant\r\nbows in the world, while there came over his face a peculiarity of\r\nexpression that was strange, if not painful, to contemplate. In another\r\nminute Henry and Marchdale were clear of the house, and with feelings of\r\nbewilderment and horror, which beggar all description, poor Henry\r\nallowed himself to be led by the arm by Marchdale to some distance,\r\nwithout uttering a word. When he did speak, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Marchdale, it would be charity of some one to kill me."\r\n\r\n"To kill you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for I am certain otherwise that I must go mad."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay; rouse yourself."\r\n\r\n"This man, Varney, is a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Marchdale," cried Henry, in a wild, excited manner, "he is\r\na vampyre. He is the dreadful being who visited Flora at the still hour\r\nof midnight, and drained the life-blood from her veins. He is a vampyre.\r\nThere are such things. I cannot doubt now. Oh, God, I wish now that your\r\nlightnings would blast me, as here I stand, for over into annihilation,\r\nfor I am going mad to be compelled to feel that such horrors can really\r\nhave existence."\r\n\r\n"Henry--Henry."\r\n\r\n"Nay, talk not to me. What can I do? Shall I kill him? Is it not a\r\nsacred duty to destroy such a thing? Oh, horror--horror. He must be\r\nkilled--destroyed--burnt, and the very dust to which he is consumed must\r\nbe scattered to the winds of Heaven. It would be a deed well done,\r\nMarchdale."\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! These words are dangerous."\r\n\r\n"I care not."\r\n\r\n"What if they were overheard now by unfriendly ears? What might not be\r\nthe uncomfortable results? I pray you be more cautious what you say of\r\nthis strange man."\r\n\r\n"I must destroy him."\r\n\r\n"And wherefore?"\r\n\r\n"Can you ask? Is he not a vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but reflect, Henry, for a moment upon the length to which you\r\nmight carry out so dangerous an argument. It is said that vampyres are\r\nmade by vampyres sucking the blood of those who, but for that\r\ncircumstance, would have died and gone to decay in the tomb along with\r\nordinary mortals; but that being so attacked during life by a vampyre,\r\nthey themselves, after death, become such."\r\n\r\n"Well--well, what is that to me?"\r\n\r\n"Have you forgotten Flora?"\r\n\r\nA cry of despair came from poor Henry\'s lips, and in a moment he seemed\r\ncompletely, mentally and physically, prostrated.\r\n\r\n"God of Heaven!" he moaned, "I had forgotten her!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you had."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if the sacrifice of my own life would suffice to put an end to all\r\nthis accumulating horror, how gladly would I lay it down. Ay, in any\r\nway--in any way. No mode of death should appal me. No amount of pain\r\nmake me shrink. I could smile then upon the destroyer, and say,\r\n\'welcome--welcome--most welcome.\'"\r\n\r\n"Rather, Henry, seek to live for those whom you love than die for them.\r\nYour death would leave them desolate. In life you may ward off many a\r\nblow of fate from them."\r\n\r\n"I may endeavour so to do."\r\n\r\n"Consider that Flora may be wholly dependent upon such kindness as you\r\nmay be able to bestow upon her."\r\n\r\n"Charles clings to her."\r\n\r\n"Humph!"\r\n\r\n"You do not doubt him?"\r\n\r\n"My dear friend, Henry Bannerworth, although I am not an old man, yet I\r\nam so much older than you that I have seen a great deal of the world,\r\nand am, perhaps, far better able to come to accurate judgments with\r\nregard to individuals."\r\n\r\n"No doubt--no doubt; but yet--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, hear me out. Such judgments, founded upon experience, when uttered\r\nhave all the character of prophecy about them. I, therefore, now\r\nprophecy to you that Charles Holland will yet be so stung with horror at\r\nthe circumstance of a vampyre visiting Flora, that he will never make\r\nher his wife."\r\n\r\n"Marchdale, I differ from you most completely," said Henry. "I know that\r\nCharles Holland is the very soul of honour."\r\n\r\n"I cannot argue the matter with you. It has not become a thing of fact.\r\nI have only sincerely to hope that I am wrong."\r\n\r\n"You are, you may depend, entirely wrong. I cannot be deceived in\r\nCharles. From you such words produce no effect but one of regret that\r\nyou should so much err in your estimate of any one. From any one but\r\nyourself they would have produced in me a feeling of anger I might have\r\nfound it difficult to smother."\r\n\r\n"It has often been my misfortune through life," said Mr. Marchdale,\r\nsadly, "to give the greatest offence where I feel the truest friendship,\r\nbecause it is in such quarters that I am always tempted to speak too\r\nfreely."\r\n\r\n"Nay, no offence," said Henry. "I am distracted, and scarcely know what\r\nI say. Marchdale, I know you are my sincere friend--but, as I tell you,\r\nI am nearly mad."\r\n\r\n"My dear Henry, be calmer. Consider upon what is to be said concerning\r\nthis interview at home."\r\n\r\n"Ay; that is a consideration."\r\n\r\n"I should not think it advisable to mention the disagreeable fact, that\r\nin your neighbour you think you have found out the nocturnal disturber\r\nof your family."\r\n\r\n"No--no."\r\n\r\n"I would say nothing of it. It is not at all probable that, after what\r\nyou have said to him this Sir Francis Varney, or whatever his real name\r\nmay be will obtrude himself upon you."\r\n\r\n"If he should he die."\r\n\r\n"He will, perhaps, consider that such a step would be dangerous to him."\r\n\r\n"It would be fatal, so help me. However, and then would I take especial\r\ncare that no power of resuscitation should ever enable that man again to\r\nwalk the earth."\r\n\r\n"They say that only way of destroying a vampyre is to fix him to the\r\nearth with a stake, so that he cannot move, and then, of course,\r\ndecomposition will take its course, as in ordinary cases."\r\n\r\n"Fire would consume him, and be a quicker process," said Henry. "But\r\nthese are fearful reflections, and, for the present, we will not pursue\r\nthem. Now to play the hypocrite, and endeavour to look composed and\r\nserene to my mother, and to Flora while my heart is breaking."\r\n\r\nThe two friends had by this time reached the hall, and leaving his\r\nfriend Marchdale, Henry Bannerworth, with feelings of the most\r\nunenviable description, slowly made his way to the apartment occupied by\r\nhis mother and sister.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ADMIRAL AND HIS SERVANT.--THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE LANDLORD OF\r\nTHE NELSON\'S ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhile those matters of most grave and serious import were going on at\r\nthe Hall, while each day, and almost each hour in each day, was\r\nproducing more and more conclusive evidence upon a matter which at first\r\nhad seemed too monstrous to be at all credited, it may well be supposed\r\nwhat a wonderful sensation was produced among the gossip-mongers of the\r\nneighbourhood by the exaggerated reports that had reached them.\r\n\r\nThe servants, who had left the Hall on no other account, as they\r\ndeclared, but sheer fright at the awful visits of the vampyre, spread\r\nthe news far and wide, so that in the adjoining villages and\r\nmarket-towns the vampyre of Bannerworth Hall became quite a staple\r\narticle of conversation.\r\n\r\nSuch a positive godsend for the lovers of the marvellous had not\r\nappeared in the country side within the memory of that sapient\r\nindividual--the oldest inhabitant.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, there was one thing which staggered some people of better\r\neducation and maturer judgments, and that was, that the more they took\r\npains to inquire into the matter, in order, if possible, to put an end\r\nto what they considered a gross lie from the commencement, the more\r\nevidence they found to stagger their own senses upon the subject.\r\n\r\nEverywhere then, in every house, public as well as private, something\r\nwas being continually said of the vampyre. Nursery maids began to think\r\na vampyre vastly superior to "old scratch and old bogie" as a means of\r\nterrifying their infant charges into quietness, if not to sleep, until\r\nthey themselves became too much afraid upon the subject to mention it.\r\n\r\nBut nowhere was gossiping carried on upon the subject with more\r\nsystematic fervour than at an inn called the Nelson\'s Arms, which was in\r\nthe high street of the nearest market town to the Hall.\r\n\r\nThere, it seemed as if the lovers of the horrible made a point of\r\nholding their head quarters, and so thirsty did the numerous discussions\r\nmake the guests, that the landlord was heard to declare that he, from\r\nhis heart, really considered a vampyre as very nearly equal to a\r\ncontested election.\r\n\r\nIt was towards evening of the same day that Marchdale and Henry made\r\ntheir visit to Sir Francis Varney, that a postchaise drew up to the inn\r\nwe have mentioned. In the vehicle were two persons of exceedingly\r\ndissimilar appearance and general aspect.\r\n\r\nOne of these people was a man who seemed fast verging upon seventy years\r\nof age, although, from his still ruddy and embrowned complexion and\r\nstentorian voice, it was quite evident he intended yet to keep time at\r\narm\'s-length for many years to come.\r\n\r\nHe was attired in ample and expensive clothing, but every article had a\r\nnaval animus about it, if we may be allowed such an expression with\r\nregard to clothing. On his buttons was an anchor, and the general\r\nassortment and colour of the clothing as nearly assimilated as possible\r\nto the undress naval uniform of an officer of high rank some fifty or\r\nsixty years ago.\r\n\r\nHis companion was a younger man, and about his appearance there was no\r\nsecret at all. He was a genuine sailor, and he wore the shore costume of\r\none. He was hearty-looking, and well dressed, and evidently well fed.\r\n\r\nAs the chaise drove up to the door of the inn, this man made an\r\nobservation to the other to the following effect,--\r\n\r\n"A-hoy!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you lubber, what now?" cried the other.\r\n\r\n"They call this the Nelson\'s Arms; and you know, shiver me, that for the\r\nbest half of his life he had but one."\r\n\r\n"D--n you!" was the only rejoinder he got for this observation; but,\r\nwith that, he seemed very well satisfied.\r\n\r\n"Heave to!" he then shouted to the postilion, who was about to drive the\r\nchaise into the yard. "Heave to, you lubberly son of a gun! we don\'t\r\nwant to go into dock."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the old man, "let\'s get out, Jack. This is the port; and, do\r\nyou hear, and be cursed to you, let\'s have no swearing, d--n you, nor\r\nbad language, you lazy swab."\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye," cried Jack; "I\'ve not been ashore now a matter o\' ten years,\r\nand not larnt a little shore-going politeness, admiral, I ain\'t been\r\nyour _walley de sham_ without larning a little about land reckonings.\r\nNobody would take me for a sailor now, I\'m thinking, admiral."\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise!"\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye, sir."\r\n\r\nJack, as he was called, bundled out of the chaise when the door was\r\nopened, with a movement so closely resembling what would have ensued had\r\nhe been dragged out by the collar, that one was tempted almost to\r\nbelieve that such a feat must have been accomplished all at once by some\r\ninvisible agency.\r\n\r\nHe then assisted the old gentleman to alight, and the landlord of the\r\ninn commenced the usual profusion of bows with which a passenger by a\r\npostchaise is usually welcomed in preference to one by a stage coach.\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, will you!" shouted the admiral, for such indeed he was. "Be\r\nquiet."\r\n\r\n"Best accommodation, sir--good wine--well-aired beds--good\r\nattendance--fine air--"\r\n\r\n"Belay there," said Jack; and he gave the landlord what no doubt he\r\nconsidered a gentle admonition, but which consisted of such a dig in the\r\nribs, that he made as many evolutions as the clown in a pantomime when\r\nhe vociferates hot codlings.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jack, where\'s the sailing instructions?" said his master.\r\n\r\n"Here, sir, in the locker," said Jack, as he took from his pocket a\r\nletter, which he handed to the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you step in, sir?" said the landlord, who had begun now to\r\nrecover a little from the dig in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of coming into port and paying harbour dues, and all\r\nthat sort of thing, till we know if it\'s the right, you lubber, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No; oh, dear me, sir, of course--God bless me, what can the old\r\ngentleman mean?"\r\n\r\nThe admiral opened the letter, and read:--\r\n\r\n     "If you stop at the Nelson\'s Aims at Uxotter, you will hear of\r\n     me, and I can be sent for, when I will tell you more.\r\n\r\n     "Yours, very obediently and humbly,\r\n\r\n     "JOSIAH CRINKLES."\r\n\r\n"Who the deuce is he?"\r\n\r\n"This is Uxotter, sir," said the landlord; "and here you are, sir, at\r\nthe Nelson\'s Arms. Good beds--good wine--good--"\r\n\r\n"Silence!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir--oh, of course"\r\n\r\n"Who the devil is Josiah Crinkles?"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha! ha! Makes me laugh, sir. Who the devil indeed! They do say\r\nthe devil and lawyers, sir, know something of each other--makes me\r\nsmile."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make you smile on the other side of that d----d great hatchway of\r\na mouth of yours in a minute. Who is Crinkles?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Crinkles, sir, everybody knows, most respectable attorney, sir,\r\nindeed, highly respectable man, sir."\r\n\r\n"A lawyer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, a lawyer."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m d----d!"\r\n\r\nJack gave a long whistle, and both master and man looked at each other\r\naghast.\r\n\r\n"Now, hang me!" cried the admiral, "if ever I was so taken in in all my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"To come a hundred and seventy miles see a d----d swab of a rascally\r\nlawyer."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll smash him--Jack!"\r\n\r\n"Yer honour?"\r\n\r\n"Get into the chaise again."\r\n\r\n"Well, but where\'s Master Charles? Lawyers, in course, sir, is all\r\nblessed rogues; but, howsomdever, he may have for once in his life this\r\nhere one of \'em have told us of the right channel, and if so be as he\r\nhas, don\'t be the Yankee to leave him among the pirates. I\'m ashamed on\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You infernal scoundrel; how dare you preach to me in such a way, you\r\nlubberly rascal?"\r\n\r\n"Cos you desarves it."\r\n\r\n"Mutiny--mutiny--by Jove! Jack, I\'ll have you put in irons--you\'re a\r\nscoundrel, and no seaman."\r\n\r\n"No seaman!--no seaman!"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of one."\r\n\r\n"Very good. It\'s time, then, as I was off the purser\'s books. Good bye\r\nto you; I only hopes as you may get a better seaman to stick to you and\r\nbe your _walley de sham_ nor Jack Pringle, that\'s all the harm I wish\r\nyou. You didn\'t call me no seaman in the Bay of Corfu, when the bullets\r\nwere scuttling our nobs."\r\n\r\n"Jack, you rascal, give us your fin. Come here, you d----d villain.\r\nYou\'ll leave me, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it."\r\n\r\n"Come in, then"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me I\'m no seaman. Call me a wagabone if you like, but don\'t\r\nhurt my feelings. There I\'m as tender as a baby, I am.--Don\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Confound you, who is doing it?"\r\n\r\n"The devil."\r\n\r\n"Who is?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, then."\r\n\r\nThus wrangling, they entered the inn, to the great amusement of several\r\nbystanders, who had collected to hear the altercation between them.\r\n\r\n"Would you like a private room, sir?" said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you?" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise, will you?" cried his master. "Yes, I should like a\r\nprivate room, and some grog."\r\n\r\n"Strong as the devil!" put in Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir-yes, sir. Good wines--good beds--good--"\r\n\r\n"You said all that before, you know," remarked Jack, as he bestowed upon\r\nthe landlord another terrific dig in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" cried the admiral, "you can send for that infernal lawyer,\r\nMister Landlord."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crinkles, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Who may I have the honour to say, sir, wants to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, admiral, certainly. You\'ll find him a very conversible,\r\nnice, gentlemanly little man, sir."\r\n\r\n"And tell him as Jack Pringle is here, too," cried the seaman.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes--of course," said the landlord, who was in such a state of\r\nconfusion from the digs in the ribs he had received and the noise his\r\nguests had already made in his house, that, had he been suddenly put\r\nupon his oath, he would scarcely have liked to say which was the master\r\nand which was the man.\r\n\r\n"The idea now, Jack," said the admiral, "of coming all this way to see a\r\nlawyer."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"If he\'d said he was a lawyer, we would have known what to do. But it\'s\r\na take in, Jack."\r\n\r\n"So I think. Howsomdever, we\'ll serve him out when we catch him, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Good--so we will."\r\n\r\n"And, then, again, he may know something about Master Charles, sir, you\r\nknow. Lord love him, don\'t you remember when he came aboard to see you\r\nonce at Portsmouth?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And how he said he hated the French, and quite a baby, too. What\r\nperseverance and sense. \'Uncle,\' says he to you, \'when I\'m a big man,\r\nI\'ll go in a ship, and fight all the French in a heap,\' says he. \'And\r\nbeat \'em, my boy, too,\' says you; cos you thought he\'d forgot that; and\r\nthen he says, \'what\'s the use of saying that, stupid?--don\'t we always\r\nbeat \'em?\'"\r\n\r\nThe admiral laughed and rubbed his hands, as he cried aloud,--\r\n\r\n"I remember, Jack--I remember him. I was stupid to make such a remark."\r\n\r\n"I know you was--a d----d old fool I thought you."\r\n\r\n"Come, come. Hilloa, there!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what do you call me no seaman for?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Jack, you bear malice like a marine."\r\n\r\n"There you go again. Goodbye. Do you remember when we were yard arm to\r\nyard arm with those two Yankee frigates, and took \'em both! You didn\'t\r\ncall me a marine then, when the scuppers were running with blood. Was I\r\na seaman then?"\r\n\r\n"You were, Jack--you were; and you saved my life."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"You did."\r\n\r\n"I say I didn\'t--it was a marlin-spike."\r\n\r\n"But I say you did, you rascally scoundrel.--I say you did, and I won\'t\r\nbe contradicted in my own ship."\r\n\r\n"Call this your ship?"\r\n\r\n"No, d--n it--I--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crinkles," said the landlord, flinging the door wide open, and so\r\nat once putting an end to the discussion which always apparently had a\r\ntendency to wax exceedingly warm.\r\n\r\n"The shark, by G--d!" said Jack.\r\n\r\nA little, neatly dressed man made his appearance, and advanced rather\r\ntimidly into the room. Perhaps he had heard from the landlord that the\r\nparties who had sent for him were of rather a violent sort.\r\n\r\n"So you are Crinkles, are you?" cried the admiral. "Sit down, though you\r\nare a lawyer."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir. I am an attorney, certainly, and my name as certainly\r\nis Crinkles."\r\n\r\n"Look at that."\r\n\r\nThe admiral placed the letter in the little lawyer\'s hands, who said,--\r\n\r\n"Am I to read it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Aloud?"\r\n\r\n"Read it to the devil, if you like, in a pig\'s whisper, or a West India\r\nhurricane."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very good, sir. I--I am willing to be agreeable, so I\'ll read it\r\naloud, if it\'s all the same to you."\r\n\r\nHe then opened the letter, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n     "To Admiral Bell.\r\n\r\n     "Admiral,--Being, from various circumstances, aware that you take\r\n     a warm and a praiseworthy interest in your nephew, Charles\r\n     Holland, I venture to write to you concerning a matter in which\r\n     your immediate and active co-operation with others may rescue him\r\n     from a condition which will prove, if allowed to continue, very\r\n     much to his detriment, and ultimate unhappiness.\r\n\r\n     "You are, then, hereby informed, that he, Charles Holland, has,\r\n     much earlier than he ought to have done, returned to England, and\r\n     that the object of his return is to contract a marriage into a\r\n     family in every way objectionable, and with a girl who is highly\r\n     objectionable.\r\n\r\n     "You, admiral, are his nearest and almost his only relative in\r\n     the world; you are the guardian of his property, and, therefore,\r\n     it becomes a duty on your part to interfere to save him from the\r\n     ruinous consequences of a marriage, which is sure to bring ruin\r\n     and distress upon himself and all who take an interest in his\r\n     welfare.\r\n\r\n     "The family he wishes to marry into is named Bannerworth, and the\r\n     young lady\'s name is Flora Bannerworth. When, however, I inform\r\n     you that a vampyre is in that family, and that if he marries into\r\n     it, he marries a vampyre, and will have vampyres for children, I\r\n     trust I have said enough to warn you upon the subject, and to\r\n     induce you to lose no time in repairing to the spot.\r\n\r\n     "If you stop at the Nelson\'s Arms at Uxotter, you will hear of\r\n     me. I can be sent for, when I will tell you more.\r\n\r\n     "Yours, very obediently and humbly,\r\n\r\n     "JOSIAH CRINKLES."\r\n\r\n     "P.S. I enclose you Dr. Johnson\'s definition of a vampyre, which\r\n     is as follows:\r\n\r\n     "VAMPYRE (a German blood-sucker)--by which you perceive how many\r\n     vampyres, from time immemorial, must have been well entertained\r\n     at the expense of John Bull, at the court of St. James, where no\r\n     thing hardly is to be met with but German blood-suckers."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lawyer ceased to read, and the amazed look with which he glanced at\r\nthe face of Admiral Bell would, under any other circumstances, have much\r\namused him. His mind, however, was by far too much engrossed with a\r\nconsideration of the danger of Charles Holland, his nephew, to be amused\r\nat anything; so, when he found that the little lawyer said nothing, he\r\nbellowed out,--\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"We--we--well," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve sent for you, and here you are, and here I am, and here\'s Jack\r\nPringle. What have you got to say?"\r\n\r\n"Just this much," said Mr. Crinkles, recovering himself a little, "just\r\nthis much, sir, that I never saw that letter before in all my life."\r\n\r\n"You--never--saw--it?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you write it?"\r\n\r\n"On my solemn word of honour, sir, I did not."\r\n\r\nJack Pringle whistled, and the admiral looked puzzled. Like the admiral\r\nin the song, too, he "grew paler," and then Mr. Crinkles added,--\r\n\r\n"Who has forged my name to a letter such as this, I cannot imagine. As\r\nfor writing to you, sir, I never heard of your existence, except\r\npublicly, as one of those gallant officers who have spent a long life in\r\nnobly fighting their country\'s battles, and who are entitled to the\r\nadmiration and the applause of every Englishman."\r\n\r\nJack and the admiral looked at each other in amazement, and then the\r\nlatter exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"What! This from a lawyer?"\r\n\r\n"A lawyer, sir," said Crinkles, "may know how to appreciate the deeds of\r\ngallant men, although he may not be able to imitate them. That letter,\r\nsir, is a forgery, and I now leave you, only much gratified at the\r\nincident which has procured me the honour of an interview with a\r\ngentleman, whose name will live in the history of his country. Good day,\r\nsir! Good day!"\r\n\r\n"No! I\'m d----d if you go like that," said Jack, as he sprang to the\r\ndoor, and put his back against it. "You shall take a glass with me in\r\nhonour of the wooden walls of Old England, d----e, if you was twenty\r\nlawyers."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Jack," said the admiral. "Come, Mr. Crinkles, I\'ll think,\r\nfor your sake, there may be two decent lawyers in the world, and you one\r\nof them. We must have a bottle of the best wine the ship--I mean the\r\nhouse--can afford together."\r\n\r\n"If it is your command, admiral, I obey with pleasure," said the\r\nattorney; "and although I assure you, on my honour, I did not write that\r\nletter, yet some of the matters mentioned in it are so generally\r\nnotorious here, that I can afford you information concerning them."\r\n\r\n"Can you?"\r\n\r\n"I regret to say I can, for I respect the parties."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, then--sit down. Jack, run to the steward\'s room and get the\r\nwine. We will go into it now starboard and larboard. Who the deuce could\r\nhave written that letter?"\r\n\r\n"I have not the least idea, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well--well, never mind; it has brought me here, that\'s something, so I\r\nwon\'t grumble much at it. I didn\'t know my nephew was in England, and I\r\ndare say he didn\'t know I was; but here we both are, and I won\'t rest\r\ntill I\'ve seen him, and ascertained how the what\'s-its-name--"\r\n\r\n"The vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Ah! the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Shiver my timbers!" said Jack Pringle, who now brought in some wine\r\nmuch against the remonstrances of the waiters of the establishment, who\r\nconsidered that he was treading upon their vested interests by so\r\ndoing.--"Shiver my timbers, if I knows what a _wamphigher_ is, unless\r\nhe\'s some distant relation to Davy Jones!"\r\n\r\n"Hold your ignorant tongue," said the admiral; "nobody wants you to make\r\na remark, you great lubber!"\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Jack, and he sat down the wine on the table, and then\r\nretired to the other end of the room, remarking to himself that he was\r\nnot called a great lubber on a certain occasion, when bullets were\r\nscuttling their nobs, and they were yard arm and yard arm with God knows\r\nwho.\r\n\r\n"Now, mister lawyer," said Admiral Bell, who had about him a large share\r\nof the habits of a rough sailor. "Now, mister lawyer, here is a glass\r\nfirst to our better acquaintance, for d----e, if I don\'t like you!"\r\n\r\n"You are very good, sir."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. There was a time, when I\'d just as soon have thought of\r\nasking a young shark to supper with me in my own cabin as a lawyer, but\r\nI begin to see that there may be such a thing as a decent, good sort of\r\na fellow seen in the law; so here\'s good luck to you, and you shall\r\nnever want a friend or a bottle while Admiral Bell has a shot in the\r\nlocker."\r\n\r\n"Gammon," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"D--n you, what do you mean by that?" roared the admiral, in a furious\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t speaking to you," shouted Jack, about two octaves higher.\r\n"It\'s two boys in the street as is pretending they\'re a going to fight,\r\nand I know d----d well they won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going. I wasn\'t told to hold my noise, when our nobs were being\r\nscuttled off Beyrout."\r\n\r\n"Never mind him, mister lawyer," added the admiral. "He don\'t know what\r\nhe\'s talking about. Never mind him. You go on and tell me all you know\r\nabout the--the--"\r\n\r\n"The vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I always forget the names of strange fish. I suppose, after all,\r\nit\'s something of the mermaid order?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot say, sir; but certainly the story, in all its painful\r\nparticulars, has made a great sensation all over the country."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. You shall hear how it occurred. It appears that one night\r\nMiss Flora Bannersworth, a young lady of great beauty, and respected and\r\nadmired by all who knew her was visited by a strange being who came in\r\nat the window."\r\n\r\n"My eye," said Jack, "it waren\'t me, I wish it had a been."\r\n\r\n"So petrified by fear was she, that she had only time to creep half out\r\nof the bed, and to utter one cry of alarm, when the strange visitor\r\nseized her in his grasp."\r\n\r\n"D--n my pig tail," said Jack, "what a squall there must have been, to\r\nbe sure."\r\n\r\n"Do you see this bottle?" roared the admiral.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, I does; I think as it\'s time I seed another."\r\n\r\n"You scoundrel, I\'ll make you feel it against that d----d stupid head of\r\nyours, if you interrupt this gentleman again."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be violent."\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying," continued the attorney, "she did, by great good\r\nfortune, manage to scream, which had the effect of alarming the whole\r\nhouse. The door of her chamber, which was fast, was broken open."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--"\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried Jack.\r\n\r\n"You may imagine the horror and the consternation of those who entered\r\nthe room to find her in the grasp of a fiend-like figure, whose teeth\r\nwere fastened on her neck, and who was actually draining her veins of\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"The devil!"\r\n\r\n"Before any one could lay hands sufficiently upon the figure to detain\r\nit, it had fled precipitately from its dreadful repast. Shots were fired\r\nafter it in vain."\r\n\r\n"And they let it go?"\r\n\r\n"They followed it, I understand, as well as they were able, and saw it\r\nscale the garden wall of the premises; there it escaped, leaving, as you\r\nmay well imagine, on all their minds, a sensation of horror difficult to\r\ndescribe."\r\n\r\n"Well, I never did hear anything the equal of that. Jack, what do you\r\nthink of it?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t begun to think, yet," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"But what about my nephew, Charles?" added the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Of him I know nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word, admiral. I was not aware you had a nephew, or that any\r\ngentleman bearing that, or any other relationship to you, had any sort\r\nof connexion with these mysterious and most unaccountable circumstances.\r\nI tell you all I have gathered from common report about this vampyre\r\nbusiness. Further I know not, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Well, a man can\'t tell what he don\'t know. It puzzles me to think who\r\ncould possibly have written me this letter."\r\n\r\n"That I am completely at a loss to imagine," said Crinkles. "I assure\r\nyou, my gallant sir, that I am much hurt at the circumstance of any one\r\nusing my name in such a way. But, nevertheless, as you are here, permit\r\nme to say, that it will be my pride, my pleasure, and the boast of the\r\nremainder of my existence, to be of some service to so gallant a\r\ndefender of my country, and one whose name, along with the memory of his\r\ndeeds, is engraved upon the heart of every Briton."\r\n\r\n"Quite ekal to a book, he talks," said Jack. "I never could read one\r\nmyself, on account o\' not knowing how, but I\'ve heard \'em read, and\r\nthat\'s just the sort o\' incomprehensible gammon."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want any of your ignorant remarks," said the admiral, "so you\r\nbe quiet."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Now, Mister Lawyer, you are an honest fellow, and an honest fellow is\r\ngenerally a sensible fellow."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I thank you."\r\n\r\n"If so be as what this letter says is true, my nephew Charles has got a\r\nliking for this girl, who has had her neck bitten by a vampyre, you\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"I perceive, sir."\r\n\r\n"Now what would you do?"\r\n\r\n"One of the most difficult, as well, perhaps, as one of the most\r\nungracious of tasks," said the attorney, "is to interfere with family\r\naffairs. The cold and steady eye of reason generally sees things in such\r\nvery different lights to what they appear to those whose feelings and\r\nwhose affections are much compromised in their results."\r\n\r\n"Very true. Go on."\r\n\r\n"Taking, my dear sir, what in my humble judgment appears to be a\r\nreasonable view of this subject, I should say it would be a dreadful\r\nthing for your nephew to marry into a family any member of which was\r\nliable to the visitations of a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be pleasant."\r\n\r\n"The young lady might have children."\r\n\r\n"Oh, lots," cried Jack.\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"And she might herself actually, when after death she became a vampyre,\r\ncome and feed on her own children."\r\n\r\n"Become a vampyre! What, is she going to be a vampyre too?"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, don\'t you know that it is a remarkable fact, as regards\r\nthe physiology of vampyres, that whoever is bitten by one of those\r\ndreadful beings, becomes a vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"The devil!"\r\n\r\n"It is a fact, sir."\r\n\r\n"Whew!" whistled Jack; "she might bite us all, and we should be a whole\r\nship\'s crew o\' _wamphighers_. There would be a confounded go!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not pleasant," said the admiral, as he rose from his chair, and\r\npaced to and fro in the room, "it\'s not pleasant. Hang me up at my own\r\nyard-arm if it is."\r\n\r\n"Who said it was?" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n"Who asked you, you brute?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," added Mr. Crinkles, "I have given you all the information I\r\ncan; and I can only repeat what I before had the honour of saying more\r\nat large, namely, that I am your humble servant to command, and that I\r\nshall be happy to attend upon you at any time."\r\n\r\n"Thank ye--thank ye, Mr.--a--a--"\r\n\r\n"Crinkles."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Crinkles. You shall hear from me again, sir, shortly. Now that I am\r\ndown here, I will see to the very bottom of this affair, were it deeper\r\nthan fathom ever sounded. Charles Holland was my poor sister\'s son; he\'s\r\nthe only relative I have in the wide world, and his happiness is dearer\r\nto my heart than my own."\r\n\r\nCrinkles turned aside, and, by the twinkle of his eyes, one might\r\npremise that the honest little lawyer was much affected.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, sir," he said; "farewell."\r\n\r\n"Good day to you."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, lawyer," cried Jack. "Mind how you go. D--n me, if you don\'t\r\nseem a decent sort of fellow, and, after all, you may give the devil a\r\nclear berth, and get into heaven\'s straits with a flowing sheet,\r\nprovided as you don\'t, towards the end of the voyage, make any lubberly\r\nblunders."\r\n\r\nThe old admiral threw himself into a chair with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n"Jack," said he.\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye, sir."\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done now?"\r\n\r\nJack opened the window to discharge the superfluous moisture from an\r\nenormous quid he had indulged himself with while the lawyer was telling\r\nabout the vampyre, and then again turning his face towards his master,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"Do! What shall we do? Why, go at once and find out Charles, our _nevy_,\r\nand ask him all about it, and see the young lady, too, and lay hold o\'\r\nthe _wamphigher_ if we can, as well, and go at the whole affair\r\nbroadside to broadside, till we make a prize of all the particulars,\r\nafter which we can turn it over in our minds agin, and see what\'s to be\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"Jack, you are right. Come along."\r\n\r\n"I knows I am. Do you know now which way to steer?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not. I never was in this latitude before, and the channel\r\nlooks intricate. We will hail a pilot, Jack, and then we shall be all\r\nright, and if we strike it will be his fault."\r\n\r\n"Which is a mighty great consolation," said Jack. "Come along."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF THE LOVERS IN THE GARDEN.--AN AFFECTING SCENE.--THE\r\nSUDDEN APPEARANCE OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur readers will recollect that Flora Bannerworth had made an\r\nappointment with Charles Holland in the garden of the hall. This meeting\r\nwas looked forward to by the young man with a variety of conflicting\r\nfeelings, and he passed the intermediate time in a most painful state of\r\ndoubt as to what would be its result.\r\n\r\nThe thought that he should be much urged by Flora to give up all\r\nthoughts of making her his, was a most bitter one to him, who loved her\r\nwith so much truth and constancy, and that she would say all she could\r\nto induce such a resolution in his mind he felt certain. But to him the\r\nidea of now abandoning her presented itself in the worst of aspects.\r\n\r\n"Shall I," he said, "sink so low in my own estimation, as well as in\r\nhers, and in that of all honourable-minded persons, as to desert her now\r\nin the hour of affliction? Dare I be so base as actually or virtually to\r\nsay to her, \'Flora, when your beauty was undimmed by sorrow--when all\r\naround you seemed life and joy, I loved you selfishly for the increased\r\nhappiness which you might bestow upon me; but now the hand of misfortune\r\npresses heavily upon you--you are not what you were, and I desert you?\r\nNever--never--never!"\r\n\r\nCharles Holland, it will be seen by some of our more philosophic\r\nneighbours, felt more acutely than he reasoned; but let his errors of\r\nargumentation be what they may, can we do other than admire the nobility\r\nof soul which dictated such a self denying generous course as that he\r\nwas pursuing?\r\n\r\nAs for Flora, Heaven only knows if at that precise time her intellect\r\nhad completely stood the test of the trying events which had nearly\r\noverwhelmed it.\r\n\r\nThe two grand feelings that seemed to possess her mind were fear of the\r\nrenewed visit of the vampyre, and an earnest desire to release Charles\r\nHolland from his repeated vows of constancy towards her.\r\n\r\nFeeling, generosity, and judgment, all revolted holding a young man to\r\nsuch a destiny as hers. To link him to her fate, would be to make him to\r\na real extent a sharer in it, and the more she heard fall from his lips\r\nin the way of generous feelings of continued attachment to her, the more\r\nseverely did she feel that he would suffer most acutely if united to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd she was right. The very generosity of feeling which would have now\r\nprompted Charles Holland to lead Flora Bannerworth to the altar, even\r\nwith the marks of the vampyre\'s teeth upon her throat, gave an assurance\r\nof a depth of feeling which would have made him an ample haven in all\r\nher miseries, in all her distresses and afflictions.\r\n\r\nWhat was familiarly in the family at the Hall called the garden, was a\r\nsemicircular piece of ground shaded in several directions by trees, and\r\nwhich was exclusively devoted to the growth of flowers. The piece of\r\nground was nearly hidden from the view of the house, and in its centre\r\nwas a summer-house, which at the usual season of the year was covered\r\nwith all kinds of creeping plants of exquisite perfumes, and rare\r\nbeauty. All around, too, bloomed the fairest and sweetest of flowers,\r\nwhich a rich soil and a sheltered situation could produce.\r\n\r\nAlas! though, of late many weeds had straggled up among their more\r\nestimable floral culture, for the decayed fortunes of the family had\r\nprevented them from keeping the necessary servants, to place the Hall\r\nand its grounds in a state of neatness, such as it had once been the\r\npride of the inhabitants of the place to see them. It was then in this\r\nflower-garden that Charles and Flora used to meet.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, he was on the spot before the appointed hour,\r\nanxiously expecting the appearance of her who was so really and truly\r\ndear to him. What to him were the sweet flowers that there grew in such\r\nhappy luxuriance and heedless beauty? Alas, the flower that to his mind\r\nwas fairer than them all, was blighted, and in the wan cheek of her whom\r\nhe loved, he sighed to see the lily usurping the place of the radiant\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear Flora," he ejaculated, "you must indeed be taken from this\r\nplace, which is so full of the most painful remembrance; now, I cannot\r\nthink that Mr. Marchdale somehow is a friend to me, but that conviction,\r\nor rather impression, does not paralyze my judgment sufficiently to\r\ninduce me not to acknowledge that his advice is good. He might have\r\ncouched it in pleasanter words--words that would not, like daggers, each\r\nhave brought a deadly pang home to my heart, but still I do think that\r\nin his conclusion he was right."\r\n\r\nA light sound, as of some fairy footstep among the flowers, came upon\r\nhis ears, and turning instantly to the direction from whence the sound\r\nproceeded, he saw what his heart had previously assured him of, namely,\r\nthat it was his Flora who was coming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, it was she; but, ah, how pale, how wan--how languid and full of the\r\nevidences of much mental suffering was she. Where now was the elasticity\r\nof that youthful step? Where now was that lustrous beaming beauty of\r\nmirthfulness, which was wont to dawn in those eyes?\r\n\r\nAlas, all was changed. The exquisite beauty of form was there, but the\r\nlight of joy which had lent its most transcendent charms to that\r\nheavenly face, was gone. Charles was by her side in a moment. He had her\r\nhand clasped in his, while his disengaged one was wound tenderly around\r\nher taper waist.\r\n\r\n"Flora, dear, dear Flora," he said, "you are better. Tell me that you\r\nfeel the gentle air revives you?"\r\n\r\nShe could not speak. Her heart was too full of woe.\r\n\r\n"Oh; Flora, my own, my beautiful," he added, in those tones which come\r\nso direct from the heart, and which are so different from any assumption\r\nof tenderness. "Speak to me, dear, dear Flora--speak to me if it be but\r\na word."\r\n\r\n"Charles," was all she could say, and then she burst into a flood of\r\ntears, and leant so heavily upon his arm, that it was evident but for\r\nthat support she must have fallen.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland welcomed those, although, they grieved him so much that\r\nhe could have accompanied them with his own, but then he knew that she\r\nwould be soon now more composed, and that they would relieve the heart\r\nwhose sorrows called them into existence.\r\n\r\nHe forbore to speak to her until he found this sudden gush of feeling\r\nwas subsiding into sobs, and then in low, soft accents, he again\r\nendeavoured to breathe comfort to her afflicted and terrified spirit.\r\n\r\n"My Flora," he said, "remember that there are warm hearts that love you.\r\nRemember that neither time nor circumstance can change such endearing\r\naffection as mine. Ah, Flora, what evil is there in the whole world that\r\nlove may not conquer, and in the height of its noble feelings laugh to\r\nscorn."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, hush, Charles, hush."\r\n\r\n"Wherefore, Flora, would you still the voice of pure affection? I love\r\nyou surely, as few have ever loved. Ah, why would you forbid me to give\r\nsuch utterance as I may to those feelings which fill up my whole heart?"\r\n\r\n"No--no--no."\r\n\r\n"Flora, Flora, wherefore do you say no?"\r\n\r\n"Do not, Charles, now speak to me of affection or love. Do not tell me\r\nyou love me now."\r\n\r\n"Not tell you I love you! Ah, Flora, if my tongue, with its poor\r\neloquence to give utterance to such a sentiment, were to do its office,\r\neach feature of my face would tell the tale. Each action would show to\r\nall the world how much I loved you."\r\n\r\n"I must not now hear this. Great God of Heaven give me strength to carry\r\nout the purpose of my soul."\r\n\r\n"What purpose is it, Flora, that you have to pray thus fervently for\r\nstrength to execute? Oh, if it savour aught of treason against love\'s\r\nmajesty, forget it. Love is a gift from Heaven. The greatest and the\r\nmost glorious gift it ever bestowed upon its creatures. Heaven will not\r\naid you in repudiating that which is the one grand redeeming feature\r\nthat rescues human nature from a world of reproach."\r\n\r\nFlora wrung her hands despairingly as she said,--\r\n\r\n"Charles, I know I cannot reason with you. I know I have not power of\r\nlanguage, aptitude of illustration, nor depth of thought to hold a\r\nmental contention with you."\r\n\r\n"Flora, for what do I contend?"\r\n\r\n"You, you speak of love."\r\n\r\n"And I have, ere this, spoken to you of love unchecked."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Before this."\r\n\r\n"And now, wherefore not now? Do not tell me you are changed."\r\n\r\n"I am changed, Charles. Fearfully changed. The curse of God has fallen\r\nupon me, I know not why. I know not that in word or in thought I have\r\ndone evil, except perchance unwittingly, and yet--the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Let not that affright you."\r\n\r\n"Affright me! It has killed me."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Flora,--you think too much of what I still hope to be susceptible\r\nof far more rational explanation."\r\n\r\n"By your own words, then, Charles, I must convict you. I cannot, I dare\r\nnot be yours, while such a dreadful circumstance is hanging over me,\r\nCharles; if a more rational explanation than the hideous one which my\r\nown fancy gives to the form that visits me can be found, find it, and\r\nrescue me from despair and from madness."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the summer-house, and as Flora uttered these words\r\nshe threw herself on to a seat, and covering her beautiful face with her\r\nhands, she sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\n"You have spoken," said Charles, dejectedly. "I have heard that which\r\nyou wished to say to me."\r\n\r\n"No, no. Not all, Charles."\r\n\r\n"I will be patient, then, although what more you may have to add should\r\ntear my very heart-strings."\r\n\r\n"I--I have to add, Charles," she said, in a tremulous voice, "that\r\njustice, religion, mercy--every human attribute which bears the name of\r\nvirtue, calls loudly upon me no longer to hold you to vows made under\r\ndifferent auspices."\r\n\r\n"Go on, Flora."\r\n\r\n"I then implore you, Charles, finding me what I am, to leave me to the\r\nfate which it has pleased Heaven to cast upon me. I do not ask you,\r\nCharles, not to love me."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well. Go on, Flora."\r\n\r\n"Because I should like to think that, although I might never see you\r\nmore, you loved me still. But you must think seldom of me, and you must\r\nendeavour to be happy with some other--"\r\n\r\n"You cannot, Flora, pursue the picture you yourself would draw. These\r\nwords come not from your heart."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever love me?"\r\n\r\n"Charles, Charles, why will you add another pang to those you know must\r\nalready rend my heart?"\r\n\r\n"No, Flora, I would tear my own heart from my bosom ere I would add one\r\npang to yours. Well I know that gentle maiden modesty would seal your\r\nlips to the soft confession that you loved me. I could not hope the joy\r\nof hearing you utter these words. The tender devoted lover is content to\r\nsee the truthful passion in the speaking eyes of beauty. Content is he\r\nto translate it from a thousand acts, which, to eyes that look not so\r\nacutely as a lover\'s, bear no signification; but when you tell me to\r\nseek happiness with another, well may the anxious question burst from my\r\nthrobbing heart of, \'Did you ever love me, Flora?\'"\r\n\r\nHer senses hung entranced upon his words. Oh, what a witchery is in the\r\ntongue of love. Some even of the former colour of her cheek returned as\r\nforgetting all for the moment but that she was listening to the voice of\r\nhim, the thoughts of whom had made up the day dream of her happiness,\r\nshe gazed upon his face.\r\n\r\nHis voice ceased. To her it seemed as if some music had suddenly left\r\noff in its most exquisite passage. She clung to his arm--she looked\r\nimploringly up to him. Her head sunk upon his breast as she cried,\r\n\r\n"Charles, Charles, I did love you. I do love you now."\r\n\r\n"Then let sorrow and misfortune shake their grisly locks in vain," he\r\ncried. "Heart to heart--hand to hand with me, defy them."\r\n\r\nHe lifted up his arms towards Heaven as he spoke, and at the moment came\r\nsuch a rattling peal of thunder, that the very earth seemed to shake\r\nupon its axis.\r\n\r\nA half scream of terror burst from the lips of Flora, as she cried,--\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\n"Only thunder," said Charles, calmly.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas an awful sound."\r\n\r\n"A natural one."\r\n\r\n"But at such a moment, when you were defying Fate to injure us. Oh!\r\nCharles, is it ominous?"\r\n\r\n"Flora, can you really give way to such idle fancies?"\r\n\r\n"The sun is obscured."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but it will shine all the brighter for its temporary eclipse. The\r\nthunder-storm will clear the air of many noxious vapours; the forked\r\nlightning has its uses as well as its powers of mischief. Hark! there\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\nAnother peal, of almost equal intensity to the other, shook the\r\nfirmament. Flora trembled.\r\n\r\n"Charles," she said, "this is the voice of Heaven. We must part--we must\r\npart for ever. I cannot be yours."\r\n\r\n"Flora, this is madness. Think again, dear Flora. Misfortunes for a time\r\nwill hover over the best and most fortunate of us; but, like the clouds\r\nthat now obscure the sweet sunshine, will pass away, and leave no trace\r\nbehind them. The sunshine of joy will shine on you again."\r\n\r\nThere was a small break in the clouds, like a window looking into\r\nHeaven. From it streamed one beam of sunlight, so bright, so dazzling,\r\nand so beautiful, that it was a sight of wonder to look upon. It fell\r\nupon the face of Flora; it warmed her cheek; it lent lustre to her pale\r\nlips and tearful eyes; it illumined that little summer-house as if it\r\nhad been the shrine of some saint.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" cried Charles, "where is your omen now?"\r\n\r\n"God of Heaven!\'" cried Flora; and she stretched out her arms.\r\n\r\n"The clouds that hover over your spirit now," said Charles, "shall pass\r\naway. Accept this beam of sunlight as a promise from God."\r\n\r\n"I will--I will. It is going."\r\n\r\n"It has done its office."\r\n\r\nThe clouds closed over the small orifice, and all was gloom again as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Flora," said Charles, "you will not ask me now to leave you?"\r\n\r\nShe allowed him to clasp her to his heart. It was beating for her, and\r\nfor her only.\r\n\r\n"You will let me, Flora, love you still?"\r\n\r\nHer voice, as she answered him, was like the murmur of some distant\r\nmelody the ears can scarcely translate to the heart.\r\n\r\n"Charles we will live, love, and die together."\r\n\r\nAnd now there was a wrapt stillness in that summer-house for many\r\nminutes--a trance of joy. They did not speak, but now and then she would\r\nlook into his face with an old familiar smile, and the joy of his heart\r\nwas near to bursting in tears from his eyes.\r\n\r\nA shriek burst from Flora\'s lips--a shriek so wild and shrill that it\r\nawakened echoes far and near. Charles staggered back a step, as if shot,\r\nand then in such agonised accents as he was long indeed in banishing the\r\nremembrance of, she cried,--\r\n\r\n"The vampyre! the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLANATION.--THE ARRIVAL OF THE ADMIRAL AT THE HOUSE.--A SCENE OF\r\nCONFUSION, AND SOME OF ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo sudden and so utterly unexpected a cry of alarm from Flora, at such a\r\ntime might well have the effect of astounding the nerves of any one, and\r\nno wonder that Charles was for a few seconds absolutely petrified and\r\nalmost unable to think.\r\n\r\nMechanically, then, he turned his eyes towards the door of the\r\nsummer-house, and there he saw a tall, thin man, rather elegantly\r\ndressed, whose countenance certainly, in its wonderful resemblance to\r\nthe portrait on the panel, might well appal any one.\r\n\r\nThe stranger stood in the irresolute attitude on the threshold of the\r\nsummer-house of one who did not wish to intrude, but who found it as\r\nawkward, if not more so now, to retreat than to advance.\r\n\r\nBefore Charles Holland could summon any words to his aid, or think of\r\nfreeing himself from the clinging grasp of Flora, which was wound around\r\nhim, the stranger made a very low and courtly bow, after which he said,\r\nin winning accents,--\r\n\r\n"I very much fear that I am an intruder here. Allow me to offer my\r\nwarmest apologies, and to assure you, sir, and you, madam, that I had no\r\nidea any one was in the arbour. You perceive the rain is falling\r\nsmartly, and I made towards here, seeing it was likely to shelter me\r\nfrom the shower."\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken in such a plausible and courtly tone of voice,\r\nthat they might well have become any drawing-room in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nFlora kept her eyes fixed upon him during the utterance of these words;\r\nand as she convulsively clutched the arm of Charles, she kept on\r\nwhispering,--\r\n\r\n"The vampyre! the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"I much fear," added the stranger, in the same bland tones, "that I have\r\nbeen the cause of some alarm to the young lady!"\r\n\r\n"Release me," whispered Charles to Flora. "Release me; I will follow him\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"No, no--do not leave me--do not leave me. The vampyre--the dreadful\r\nvampyre!"\r\n\r\n"But, Flora--"\r\n\r\n"Hush--hush--hush! It speaks again."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I ought to account for my appearance in the garden at all,"\r\nadded the insinuating stranger. "The fact is, I came on a visit--"\r\n\r\nFlora shuddered.\r\n\r\n"To Mr. Henry Bannerworth," continued the stranger; "and finding the\r\ngarden-gate open, I came in without troubling the servants, which I much\r\nregret, as I can perceive I have alarmed and annoyed the lady. Madam,\r\npray accept of my apologies."\r\n\r\n"In the name of God, who are you?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"My name is Varney."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. You are the Sir Francis Varney, residing close by, who bears\r\nso fearful a resemblance to--"\r\n\r\n"Pray go on, sir. I am all attention."\r\n\r\n"To a portrait here."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Now I reflect a moment, Mr. Henry Bannerworth did incidentally\r\nmention something of the sort. It\'s a most singular coincidence."\r\n\r\nThe sound of approaching footsteps was now plainly heard, and in a few\r\nmoments Henry and George, along with Mr. Marchdale, reached the spot.\r\nTheir appearance showed that they had made haste, and Henry at once\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"We heard, or fancied we heard, a cry of alarm."\r\n\r\n"You did hear it," said Charles Holland. "Do you know this gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"It is Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\nVarney bowed to the new comers, and was altogether as much at his ease\r\nas everybody else seemed quite the contrary. Even Charles Holland found\r\nthe difficulty of going up to such a well-bred, gentlemanly man, and\r\nsaying, "Sir, we believe you to be a vampyre"--to be almost, if not\r\ninsurmountable.\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it," he thought, "but I will watch him."\r\n\r\n"Take me away," whispered Flora. "\'Tis he--\'tis he. Oh, take me away,\r\nCharles."\r\n\r\n"Hush, Flora, hush. You are in some error; the accidental resemblance\r\nshould not make us be rude to this gentleman."\r\n\r\n"The vampyre!--it is the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sure, Flora?"\r\n\r\n"Do I know your features--my own--my brother\'s? Do not ask me to\r\ndoubt--I cannot. I am quite sure. Take me from his hideous presence,\r\nCharles."\r\n\r\n"The young lady, I fear, is very much indisposed," remarked Sir Francis\r\nVarney, in a sympathetic tone of voice. "If she will accept of my arm, I\r\nshall esteem it a great honour."\r\n\r\n"No--no--no!--God! no," cried Flora.\r\n\r\n"Madam, I will not press you."\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and Charles led Flora from the summer-house towards the hall.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, "I am bewildered--I know not what to think. That man\r\nmost certainly has been fashioned after the portrait which is on the\r\npanel in the room you formerly occupied; or it has been painted from\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"He is my midnight visitor!" exclaimed Flora. "He is the vampyre;--this\r\nSir Francis Varney is the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Good God! What can be done?"\r\n\r\n"I know not. I am nearly distracted."\r\n\r\n"Be calm, Flora. If this man be really what you name him, we now know\r\nfrom what quarter the mischief comes, which is, at all events, a point\r\ngained. Be assured we shall place a watch upon him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is terrible to meet him here."\r\n\r\n"And he is so wonderfully anxious, too, to possess the Hall."\r\n\r\n"He is--he is."\r\n\r\n"It looks strange, the whole affair. But, Flora, be assured of one\r\nthing, and that is, of your own safety."\r\n\r\n"Can I be assured of that?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly. Go to your mother now. Here we are, you see, fairly\r\nwithin doors. Go to your mother, dear Flora, and keep yourself quiet. I\r\nwill return to this mysterious man now with a cooler judgment than I\r\nleft him."\r\n\r\n"You will watch him, Charles?"\r\n\r\n"I will, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And you will not let him approach the house here alone?"\r\n\r\n"I will not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that the Almighty should allow such beings to haunt the earth!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Flora, hush! we cannot judge of his allwise purpose."\r\n\r\n\'"Tis hard that the innocent should be inflicted with its presence."\r\n\r\nCharles bowed his head in mournful assent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Is it not very, very dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"Hush--hush! Calm yourself, dearest, calm yourself. Recollect that all\r\nwe have to go upon in this matter is a resemblance, which, after all,\r\nmay be accidental. But leave it all to me, and be assured that now I\r\nhave some clue to this affair, I will not lose sight of it, or of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Charles surrendered Flora to the care of her mother, and then\r\nwas hastening back to the summer-house, when he met the whole party\r\ncoming towards the Hall, for the rain was each moment increasing in\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n"We are returning," remarked Sir Francis Varney, with a half bow and a\r\nsmile, to Charles.\r\n\r\n"Allow me," said Henry, "to introduce you, Mr. Holland, to our\r\nneighbour, Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\nCharles felt himself compelled to behave with courtesy, although his\r\nmind was so full of conflicting feelings as regarded Varney; but there\r\nwas no avoiding, without such brutal rudeness as was inconsistent with\r\nall his pursuits and habits, replying in something like the same strain\r\nto the extreme courtly politeness of the supposed vampyre.\r\n\r\n"I will watch him closely," thought Charles. "I can do no more than\r\nwatch him closely."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney seemed to be a man of the most general and discursive\r\ninformation. He talked fluently and pleasantly upon all sorts of topics,\r\nand notwithstanding he could not but have heard what Flora had said of\r\nhim, he asked no questions whatever upon that subject.\r\n\r\nThis silence as regarded a matter which would at once have induced some\r\nsort of inquiry from any other man, Charles felt told much against him,\r\nand he trembled to believe for a moment that, after all, it really might\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\n"Is he a vampyre?" he asked himself. "Are there vampyres, and is this\r\nman of fashion--this courtly, talented, educated gentleman one?" It was\r\na perfectly hideous question.\r\n\r\n"You are charmingly situated here," remarked Varney, as, after ascending\r\nthe few steps that led to the hall door, he turned and looked at the\r\nview from that slight altitude.\r\n\r\n"The place has been much esteemed," said Henry, "for its picturesque\r\nbeauties of scenery."\r\n\r\n"And well it may be. I trust, Mr. Holland, the young lady is much\r\nbetter?"\r\n\r\n"She is, sir," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"I was not honoured by an introduction."\r\n\r\n"It was my fault," said Henry, who spoke to his extraordinary guest with\r\nan air of forced hilarity. "It was my fault for not introducing you to\r\nmy sister."\r\n\r\n"And that was your sister?"\r\n\r\n"It was, sir."\r\n\r\n"Report has not belied her--she is beautiful. But she looks rather pale,\r\nI thought. Has she bad health?"\r\n\r\n"The best of health."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Perhaps the little disagreeable circumstance, which is made so\r\nmuch food for gossip in the neighbourhood, has affected her spirits?"\r\n\r\n"It has."\r\n\r\n"You allude to the supposed visit here of a vampyre?" said Charles, as\r\nhe fixed his eyes upon Varney\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I allude to the supposed appearance of a supposed vampyre in this\r\nfamily," said Sir Francis Varney, as he returned the earnest gaze of\r\nCharles, with such unshrinking assurance, that the young man was\r\ncompelled, after about a minute, nearly to withdraw his own eyes.\r\n\r\n"He will not be cowed," thought Charles. "Use has made him familiar to\r\nsuch cross-questioning."\r\n\r\nIt appeared now suddenly to occur to Henry that he had said something at\r\nVarney\'s own house which should have prevented him from coming to the\r\nHall, and he now remarked,--\r\n\r\n"We scarcely expected the pleasure of your company here, Sir Francis\r\nVarney."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear sir, I am aware of that; but you roused my curiosity. You\r\nmentioned to me that there was a portrait here amazingly like me."\r\n\r\n"Did I?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed you did, or how could I know it? I wanted to see if the\r\nresemblance was so perfect."\r\n\r\n"Did you hear, sir," added Henry, "that my sister was alarmed at your\r\nlikeness to that portrait?"\r\n\r\n"No, really."\r\n\r\n"I pray you walk in, and we will talk more at large upon that matter."\r\n\r\n"With great pleasure. One leads a monotonous life in the country, when\r\ncompared with the brilliancy of a court existence. Just now I have no\r\nparticular engagement. As we are near neighbours I see no reason why we\r\nshould not be good friends, and often interchange such civilities as\r\nmake up the amenities of existence, and which, in the country, more\r\nparticularly, are valuable."\r\n\r\nHenry could not be hypocrite enough to assent to this; but still, under\r\nthe present aspect of affairs, it was impossible to return any but a\r\ncivil reply; so he said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course--certainly. My time is very much occupied, and my\r\nsister and mother see no company."\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, how wrong."\r\n\r\n"Wrong, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, surely. If anything more than another tends to harmonize\r\nindividuals, it is the society of that fairer half of the creation which\r\nwe love for their very foibles. I am much attached to the softer sex--to\r\nyoung persons full of health. I like to see the rosy checks, where the\r\nwarm blood mantles in the superficial veins, and all is loveliness and\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nCharles shrank back, and the word "Demon" unconsciously escaped his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nSir Francis took no manner of notice of the expression, but went on\r\ntalking, as if he had been on the very happiest terms with every one\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n"Will you follow me, at once, to the chamber where the portrait hangs,"\r\nsaid Henry, "or will you partake of some refreshment first?"\r\n\r\n"No refreshment for me," said Varney. "My dear friend, if you will\r\npermit me to call you such, this is a time of the day at which I never\r\ndo take any refreshment."\r\n\r\n"Nor at any other," thought Henry.\r\n\r\nThey all went to the chamber where Charles had passed one very\r\ndisagreeable night, and when they arrived, Henry pointed to the portrait\r\non the panel, saying--\r\n\r\n"There, Sir Francis Varney, is your likeness."\r\n\r\nHe looked, and, having walked up to it, in an under tone, rather as if\r\nhe were conversing with himself than making a remark for any one else to\r\nhear, he said--\r\n\r\n"It is wonderfully like."\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"If I stand beside it, thus," said Varney, placing himself in a\r\nfavourable attitude for comparing the two faces, "I dare say you will be\r\nmore struck with the likeness than before."\r\n\r\nSo accurate was it now, that the same light fell upon his face as that\r\nunder which the painter had executed the portrait, that all started back\r\na step or two.\r\n\r\n"Some artists," remarked Varney, "have the sense to ask where a portrait\r\nis to be hung before they paint it, and then they adapt their lights and\r\nshadows to those which would fall upon the original, were it similarly\r\nsituated."\r\n\r\n"I cannot stand this," said Charles to Henry; "I must question him\r\nfarther."\r\n\r\n"As you please, but do not insult him."\r\n\r\n"I will not."\r\n\r\n"He is beneath my roof now, and, after all, it is but a hideous\r\nsuspicion we have of him."\r\n\r\n"Rely upon me."\r\n\r\nCharles stepped forward, and once again confronting Varney, with an\r\nearnest gaze, he said--\r\n\r\n"Do you know, sir, that Miss Bannerworth declares the vampyre she\r\nfancies to have visited this chamber to be, in features, the exact\r\ncounterpart of this portrait?"\r\n\r\n"Does she indeed?"\r\n\r\n"She does, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps, then, that accounts for her thinking that I am the\r\nvampyre, because I bear a strong resemblance to the portrait."\r\n\r\n"I should not be surprised," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"How very odd."\r\n\r\n"Very."\r\n\r\n"And yet entertaining. I am rather amused than otherwise. The idea of\r\nbeing a vampyre. Ha! ha! If ever I go to a masquerade again, I shall\r\ncertainly assume the character of a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"You would do it well."\r\n\r\n"I dare say, now, I should make quite a sensation."\r\n\r\n"I am certain you would. Do you not think, gentlemen, that Sir Francis\r\nVarney would enact the character to the very life? By Heavens, he would\r\ndo it so well that one might, without much difficulty, really imagine\r\nhim a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Bravo--bravo," said Varney, as he gently folded his hands together,\r\nwith that genteel applause that may even be indulged in in a box at the\r\nopera itself. "Bravo. I like to see young persons enthusiastic; it looks\r\nas if they had some of the real fire of genius in their composition.\r\nBravo--bravo."\r\n\r\nThis was, Charles thought, the very height and acme of impudence, and\r\nyet what could he do? What could he say? He was foiled by the downright\r\ncoolness of Varney.\r\n\r\nAs for Henry, George, and Mr. Marchdale, they had listened to what was\r\npassing between Sir Francis and Charles in silence. They feared to\r\ndiminish the effect of anything Charles might say, by adding a word of\r\ntheir own; and, likewise, they did not wish to lose one observation that\r\nmight come from the lips of Varney.\r\n\r\nBut now Charles appeared to have said all he had to say, he turned to\r\nthe window and looked out. He seemed like a man who had made up his\r\nmind, for a time, to give up some contest in which he had been engaged.\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps, not so much did he give it up from any feeling or\r\nconsciousness of being beaten, as from a conviction that it could be the\r\nmore effectually, at some other and far more eligible opportunity,\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nVarney now addressed Henry, saying,--\r\n\r\n"I presume the subject of our conference, when you did me the honour of\r\na call, is no secret to any one here?"\r\n\r\n"None whatever," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Then, perhaps, I am too early in asking you if you have made up your\r\nmind?"\r\n\r\n"I have scarcely, certainly, had time to think."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, do not let me hurry you; I much regret, indeed, the\r\nintrusion."\r\n\r\n"You seem anxious to possess the Hall," remarked Mr. Marchdale, to\r\nVarney.\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"Is it new to you?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. I have some boyish recollections connected with this\r\nneighbourhood, among which Bannerworth Hall stands sufficiently\r\nprominent."\r\n\r\n"May I ask how long ago that was?" said Charles Howard, rather abruptly.\r\n\r\n"I do not recollect, my enthusiastic young friend," said Varney. "How\r\nold are you?"\r\n\r\n"Just about twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"You are, then, for your age, quite a model of discretion."\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult for the most accurate observer of human\r\nnature to have decided whether this was said truthfully or ironically,\r\nso Charles made no reply to it whatever.\r\n\r\n"I trust," said Henry, "we shall induce you, as this is your first\r\nvisit, Sir Francis Varney, to the Hall, to partake of some thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, a cup of wine--"\r\n\r\n"Is at your service."\r\n\r\nHenry now led the way to a small parlour, which, although by no means\r\none of the showiest rooms of the house, was, from the care and exquisite\r\ncarving with which it abounded, much more to the taste of any who\r\npossessed an accurate judgment in such works of art.\r\n\r\nThen wine was ordered, and Charles took an opportunity of whispering to\r\nHenry,--\r\n\r\n"Notice well if he drinks."\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\n"Do you see that beneath his coat there is a raised place, as if his arm\r\nwas bound up?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"There, then, was where the bullet from the pistol fired by Flora, when\r\nwe were at the church, hit him."\r\n\r\n"Hush! for God\'s sake, hush! you are getting into a dreadful state of\r\nexcitement, Charles; hush! hush!"\r\n\r\n"And can you blame--"\r\n\r\n"No, no; but what can we do?"\r\n\r\n"You are right. Nothing can we do at present. We have a clue now, and be\r\nit our mutual inclination, as well as duty, to follow it. Oh, you shall\r\nsee how calm I will be!"\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, be so. I have noted that his eyes flash upon yours\r\nwith no friendly feeling."\r\n\r\n"His friendship were a curse."\r\n\r\n"Hush! he drinks!"\r\n\r\n"Watch him."\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen all," said Sir Francis Varney, in such soft, dulcet tones,\r\nthat it was quite a fascination to hear him speak; "gentlemen all, being\r\nas I am, much delighted with your company, do not accuse me of\r\npresumption, if I drink now, poor drinker as I am, to our future merry\r\nmeetings."\r\n\r\nHe raised the wine to his lips, and seemed to drink, after which he\r\nreplaced the glass upon the table.\r\n\r\nCharles glanced at it, it was still full.\r\n\r\n"You have not drank, Sir Francis Varney," he said.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, enthusiastic young sir," said Varney, "perhaps you will have\r\nthe liberality to allow me to take my wine how I please and when I\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"Your glass is full."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Will you drink it?"\r\n\r\n"Not at any man\'s bidding, most certainly. If the fair Flora Bannerworth\r\nwould grace the board with her sweet presence, methinks I could then\r\ndrink on, on, on."\r\n\r\n"Hark you, sir," cried Charles, "I can bear no more of this. We have had\r\nin this house most horrible and damning evidence that there are such\r\nthings as vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Have you really? I suppose you eat raw pork at supper, and so had the\r\nnightmare?"\r\n\r\n"A jest is welcome in its place, but pray hear me out, sir, if it suit\r\nyour lofty courtesy to do so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Then I say we believe, as far as human judgment has a right to go, that\r\na vampyre has been here."\r\n\r\n"Go on, it\'s interesting. I always was a lover of the wild and the\r\nwonderful."\r\n\r\n"We have, too," continued Charles, "some reason to believe that you are\r\nthe man."\r\n\r\nVarney tapped his forehead as he glanced at Henry, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, I did not know. You should have told me he was a little wrong\r\nabout the brain; I might have quarreled with the lad. Dear me, how\r\nlamentable for his poor mother."\r\n\r\n"This will not do, Sir Francis Varney _alias_ Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Oh--oh! Be calm--be calm."\r\n\r\n"I defy you to your teeth, sir! No, God, no! Your teeth!"\r\n\r\n"Poor lad! Poor lad!"\r\n\r\n"You are a cowardly demon, and here I swear to devote myself to your\r\ndestruction."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney drew himself up to his full height, and that was\r\nimmense, as he said to Henry,--\r\n\r\n"I pray you, Mr. Bannerworth, since I am thus grievously insulted\r\nbeneath your roof, to tell me if your friend here be mad or sane?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s not mad."\r\n\r\n"Then--"\r\n\r\n"Hold, sir! The quarrel shall be mine. In the name of my persecuted\r\nsister--in the name of Heaven. Sir Francis Varney, I defy you."\r\n\r\nSir Francis, in spite of his impenetrable calmness, appeared somewhat\r\nmoved, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"I have already endured insult sufficient--I will endure no more. If\r\nthere are weapons at hand--"\r\n\r\n"My young friend," interrupted Mr. Marchdale, stepping between the\r\nexcited men, "is carried away by his feelings, and knows not what he\r\nsays. You will look upon it in that light, Sir Francis."\r\n\r\n"We need no interference," exclaimed Varney, his hitherto bland voice\r\nchanging to one of fury. "The hot blooded fool wishes to fight, and he\r\nshall--to the death--to the death."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"And I say he shall not," exclaimed Mr. Marchdale, taking Henry by the\r\narm. "George," he added, turning to the young man, "assist me in\r\npersuading your brother to leave the room. Conceive the agony of your\r\nsister and mother if anything should happen to him."\r\n\r\nVarney smiled with a devilish sneer, as he listened to these words, and\r\nthen he said,--\r\n\r\n"As you will--as you will. There will be plenty of time, and perhaps\r\nbetter opportunity, gentlemen. I bid you good day."\r\n\r\nAnd with provoking coolness, he then moved towards the door, and quitted\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Remain here," said Marchdale; "I will follow him, and see that he quits\r\nthe premises."\r\n\r\nHe did so, and the young men, from the window, beheld Sir Francis\r\nwalking slowly across the garden, and then saw Mr. Marchdale follow on\r\nhis track.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus occupied, a tremendous ringing came at the gate,\r\nbut their attention was so rivetted to what was passing in the garden,\r\nthat they paid not the least attention to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMIRAL\'S ADVICE.--THE CHALLENGE TO THE VAMPYRE.--THE NEW SERVANT AT\r\nTHE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe violent ringing of the bell continued uninterruptedly until at\r\nlength George volunteered to answer it. The fact was, that now there was\r\nno servant at all in the place for, after the one who had recently\r\ndemanded of Henry her dismissal had left, the other was terrified to\r\nremain alone, and had precipitately gone from the house, without even\r\ngoing through the ceremony of announcing her intention to. To be sure,\r\nshe sent a boy for her money afterwards, which may be considered a great\r\nact of condescension.\r\n\r\nSuspecting, then, this state of things, George himself hastened to the\r\ngate, and, being not over well pleased at the continuous and unnecessary\r\nringing which was kept up at it, he opened it quickly, and cried, with\r\nmore impatience, by a vast amount, than was usual with him.\r\n\r\n"Who is so impatient that he cannot wait a seasonable time for the door\r\nto be opened?"\r\n\r\n"And who the d----l are you?" cried one who was immediately outside.\r\n\r\n"Who do you want?" cried George.\r\n\r\n"Shiver my timbers!" cried Admiral Bell, for it was no other than that\r\npersonage. "What\'s that to you?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," added Jack, "answer that if you can, you shore-going-looking\r\nswab."\r\n\r\n"Two madmen, I suppose," ejaculated George, and he would have closed the\r\ngate upon them; but Jack introduced between it and the post the end of a\r\nthick stick, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Avast there! None of that; we have had trouble enough to get in. If you\r\nare the family lawyer, or the chaplain, perhaps you\'ll tell us where\r\nMister Charley is."\r\n\r\n"Once more I demand of you who you want?" said George, who was now\r\nperhaps a little amused at the conduct of the impatient visitors.\r\n\r\n"We want the admiral\'s _nevey_" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"But how do I know who is the admiral\'s _nevey_ as you call him."\r\n\r\n"Why, Charles Holland, to be sure. Have you got him aboard or not?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charles Holland is certainly here; and, if you had said at once,\r\nand explicitly, that you wished to see him, I could have given you a\r\ndirect answer."\r\n\r\n"He is here?" cried the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Most certainly."\r\n\r\n"Come along, then; yet, stop a bit. I say, young fellow, just before we\r\ngo any further, tell us if he has maimed the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"The what?\r\n\r\n"The _wamphigher_," said Jack, by way of being, as he considered, a\r\nlittle more explanatory than the admiral.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you mean," said George; "if you wish to see Mr.\r\nCharles Holland walk in and see him. He is in this house; but, for\r\nmyself, as you are strangers to me, I decline answering any questions,\r\nlet their import be what they may."\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! who are they?" suddenly cried Jack, as he pointed to two\r\nfigures some distance off in the meadows, who appeared to be angrily\r\nconversing.\r\n\r\nGeorge glanced in the direction towards which Jack pointed, and there he\r\nsaw Sir Francis Varney and Mr. Marchdale standing within a few paces of\r\neach other, and apparently engaged in some angry discussion.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to go immediately towards them; but, before he\r\ncould execute even that suggestion of his mind, he saw Varney strike\r\nMarchdale, and the latter fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to pass," cried George, as he endeavoured to get by the rather\r\nunwieldy form of the admiral. But, before he could accomplish this, for\r\nthe gate was narrow, he saw Varney, with great swiftness, make off, and\r\nMarchdale, rising to his feet, came towards the Hall.\r\n\r\nWhen Marchdale got near enough to the garden-gate to see George, he\r\nmotioned to him to remain where he was, and then, quickening his pace,\r\nhe soon came up to the spot.\r\n\r\n"Marchdale," cried George, "you have had an encounter with Sir Francis\r\nVarney."\r\n\r\n"I have," said Marchdale, in an excited manner. "I threatened to follow\r\nhim, but he struck me to the earth as easily as I could a child. His\r\nstrength is superhuman."\r\n\r\n"I saw you fall."\r\n\r\n"I believe, but that he was observed, he would have murdered me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"What, do you mean to say that lankey, horse-marine looking fellow is as\r\nbad as that!" said the admiral.\r\n\r\nMarchdale now turned his attention to the two new comers, upon whom he\r\nlooked with some surprise, and then, turning to George, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Is this gentleman a visitor?"\r\n\r\n"To Mr. Holland, I believe he is," said George; "but I have not the\r\npleasure of knowing his name."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you may know my name as soon as you like," cried the admiral. "The\r\nenemies of old England know it, and I don\'t care if all the world knows\r\nit. I\'m old Admiral Bell, something of a hulk now, but still able to\r\nhead a quarter-deck if there was any need to do so."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," cried Jack, and taking from his pocket a boatswain\'s whistle,\r\nhe blew a blast so long, and loud, and shrill, that George was fain to\r\ncover his ears with his hands to shut out the brain-piercing, and, to\r\nhim unusual sound.\r\n\r\n"And are you, then, a relative," said Marchdale, "of Mr. Holland\'s, sir,\r\nmay I ask?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m his uncle, and be d----d to him, if you must know, and some one has\r\ntold me that the young scamp thinks of marrying a mermaid, or a ghost,\r\nor a vampyre, or some such thing, so, for the sake of the memory of his\r\npoor mother, I\'ve come to say no to the bargain, and d--n me, who\r\ncares."\r\n\r\n"Come in, sir," said George, "I will conduct you to Mr. Holland. I\r\npresume this is your servant?"\r\n\r\n"Why, not exactly. That\'s Jack Pringle, he was my boatswain, you see,\r\nand now he\'s a kind o\' something betwixt and between. Not exactly a\r\nservant."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack. "Have it all your own way, though we is paid\r\noff."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you audacious scoundrel, will you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I forgot, you don\'t like anything said about paying off, cos it\r\nputs you in mind of--"\r\n\r\n"Now, d--n you, I\'ll have you strung up to the yard-arm, you dog, if you\r\ndon\'t belay there."\r\n\r\n"I\'m done. All\'s right."\r\n\r\nBy this time the party, including the admiral, Jack, George Bannerworth,\r\nand Marchdale, had got more than half-way across the garden, and were\r\nobserved by Charles Holland and Henry, who had come to the steps of the\r\nhall to see what was going on. The moment Charles saw the admiral a\r\nchange of colour came over his face, and he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"By all that\'s surprising, there is my uncle!"\r\n\r\n"Your uncle!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, as good a hearted a man as ever drew breath, and yet, withal, as\r\nfull of prejudices, and as ignorant of life, as a child."\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for any reply from Henry, Charles Holland rushed\r\nforward, and seizing his uncle by the hand, he cried, in tones of\r\ngenuine affection,--\r\n\r\n"Uncle, dear uncle, how came you to find me out?"\r\n\r\n"Charley, my boy," cried the old man, "bless you; I mean, confound your\r\nd----d impudence; you rascal, I\'m glad to see you; no, I ain\'t, you\r\nyoung mutineer. What do you mean by it, you ugly, ill-looking, d----d\r\nfine fellow--my dear boy. Oh, you infernal scoundrel."\r\n\r\nAll this was accompanied by a shaking of the hand, which was enough to\r\ndislocate anybody\'s shoulder, and which Charles was compelled to bear as\r\nwell as he could.\r\n\r\nIt quite prevented him from speaking, however, for a few moments, for it\r\nnearly shook the breath out of him. When, then, he could get in a word,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"Uncle, I dare say you are surprised."\r\n\r\n"Surprised! D--n me, I am surprised."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall be able to explain all to your satisfaction, I am sure.\r\nAllow me now to introduce you to my friends."\r\n\r\nTurning then to Henry, Charles said,--\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Henry Bannerworth, uncle; and this Mr. George Bannerworth,\r\nboth good friends of mine; and this is Mr. Marchdale, a friend of\r\ntheirs, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"And here you see Admiral Bell, my most worthy, but rather eccentric\r\nuncle."\r\n\r\n"Confound your impudence."\r\n\r\n"What brought him here I cannot tell; but he is a brave officer, and a\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"None of your nonsense," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"And here you sees Jack Pringle," said that individual, introducing\r\nhimself, since no one appeared inclined to do that office for him, "a\r\ntar for all weathers. One as hates the French, and is never so happy as\r\nwhen he\'s alongside o\' some o\' those lubberly craft blazing away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s uncommonly true," remarked the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Will you walk in, sir?" said Henry, courteously. "Any friend of Charles\r\nHolland\'s is most welcome here. You will have much to excuse us for,\r\nbecause we are deficient in servants at present, in consequence of come\r\noccurrences in our family, which your nephew has our full permission to\r\nexplain to you in full."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very good, I tell you what it is, all of you, what I\'ve seen of\r\nyou, d----e, I like, so here goes. Come along, Jack."\r\n\r\nThe admiral walked into the house, and as he went, Charles Holland said\r\nto him,--\r\n\r\n"How came you to know I was here, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Some fellow wrote me a despatch."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, saying at you was a going to marry some odd sort of fish as it\r\nwasn\'t at all the thing to introduce into the family."\r\n\r\n"Was--was a vampyre mentioned?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the very thing."\r\n\r\n"Hush, uncle--hush."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"Do not, I implore, hint at such a thing before these kind friends of\r\nmine. I will take an opportunity within the next hour of explaining all\r\nto you, and you shall form your own kind and generous judgement upon\r\ncircumstances in which my honour and my happiness are so nearly\r\nconcerned."\r\n\r\n"Gammon," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"What, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know you want to palaver me into saying it\'s all right. I suppose\r\nif my judgment and generosity don\'t like it, I shall be an old fool, and\r\na cursed goose?"\r\n\r\n"Now, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Now, _nevey_."\r\n\r\n"Well, well--no more at present. We will talk over this at leisure. You\r\npromise me to say nothing about it until you have heard my explanation,\r\nuncle?"\r\n\r\n"Very good. Make it as soon as you can, and as short as you can, that\'s\r\nall I ask of you."\r\n\r\n"I will, I will."\r\n\r\nCharles was to the full as anxious as his uncle could be to enter upon\r\nthe subject, some remote information of which, he felt convinced, had\r\nbrought the old man down to the Hall. Who it could have been that so far\r\nintermeddled with his affairs as to write to him, he could not possibly\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nA very few words will suffice to explain the precise position in which\r\nCharles Holland was. A considerable sum of money had been left to him,\r\nbut it was saddled with the condition that he should not come into\r\npossession of it until he was one year beyond the age which is usually\r\ndenominated that of discretion, namely, twenty-one. His uncle, the\r\nadmiral, was the trustee of his fortune, and he, with rare discretion,\r\nhad got the active and zealous assistance of a professional gentleman of\r\ngreat honour and eminence to conduct the business for him.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman had advised that for the two years between the ages of\r\ntwenty and twenty-two, Charles Holland should travel, inasmuch as in\r\nEnglish society he would find himself in an awkward position, being for\r\none whole year of age, and yet waiting for his property.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, reasoned the lawyer, a young man, unless he is\r\npossessed of very rare discretion indeed, is almost sure to get\r\nfearfully involved with money-lenders. Being of age, his notes, and\r\nbills, and bonds would all be good, and he would be in a ten times worse\r\nsituation than a wealthy minor.\r\n\r\nAll this was duly explained to Charles, who, rather eagerly than\r\notherwise, caught at the idea of a two years wander on the continent,\r\nwhere he could visit so many places, which to a well read young man like\r\nhimself, and one of a lively imagination, were full of the most\r\ndelightful associations.\r\n\r\nBut the acquaintance with Flora Bannerworth effected a great revolution\r\nin his feelings. The dearest, sweetest spot on earth became that which\r\nshe inhabited. When the Bannerworths left him abroad, he knew not what\r\nto do with himself. Everything, and every pursuit in which he had before\r\ntaken a delight, became most distasteful to him. He was, in fact, in a\r\nshort time, completely "used up," and then he determined upon returning\r\nto England, and finding out the dear object of his attachment at once.\r\nThis resolution was no sooner taken, than his health and spirits\r\nreturned to him, and with what rapidity he could, he now made his way to\r\nhis native shores.\r\n\r\nThe two years were so nearly expired, that he made up his mind he would\r\nnot communicate either with his uncle, the admiral, or the professional\r\ngentleman upon whose judgment he set so high and so just a value. And at\r\nthe Hall he considered he was in perfect security from any interruption,\r\nand so he would have been, but for that letter which was written to\r\nAdmiral Bell, and signed Josiah Crinkles, but which Josiah Crinkles so\r\nemphatically denied all knowledge of. Who wrote it, remains at present\r\none of those mysteries which time, in the progress of our narrative,\r\nwill clear up.\r\n\r\nThe opportune, or rather the painful juncture at which Charles Holland\r\nhad arrived at Bannerworth Hall, we are well cognisant of. Where he\r\nexpected to find smiles he found tears, and the family with whom he had\r\nfondly hoped he should pass a time of uninterrupted happiness, he found\r\nplunged in the gloom incidental to an occurrence of the most painful\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOur readers will perceive, too, that coming as he did with an utter\r\ndisbelief in the vampyre, Charles had been compelled, in some measure,\r\nto yield to the overwhelming weight of evidence which had been brought\r\nto bear upon the subject, and although he could not exactly be said to\r\nbelieve in the existence and the appearance of the vampyre at\r\nBannerworth Hall, he was upon the subject in a most painful state of\r\ndoubt and indecision.\r\n\r\nCharles now took an opportunity to speak to Henry privately, and inform\r\nhim exactly how he stood with his uncle, adding--\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear friend, if you forbid me, I will not tell my uncle of this\r\nsad affair, but I must own I would rather do so fully and freely, and\r\ntrust to his own judgment upon it."\r\n\r\n"I implore you to do so," said Henry. "Conceal nothing. Let him know the\r\nprecise situation and circumstances of the family by all means. There is\r\nnothing so mischievous as secrecy: I have the greatest dislike to it. I\r\nbeg you tell him all."\r\n\r\n"I will; and with it, Henry, I will tell him that my heart is\r\nirrevocably Flora\'s."\r\n\r\n"Your generous clinging to one whom your heart saw and loved, under very\r\ndifferent auspices," said Henry, "believe me, Charles, sinks deep into\r\nmy heart. She has related to me something of a meeting she had with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Henry, she may tell you what I said; but there are no words which\r\ncan express the depth of my tenderness. \'Tis only time which can prove\r\nhow much I love her."\r\n\r\n"Go to your uncle," said Henry, in a voice of emotion. "God bless you,\r\nCharles. It is true you would have been fully justified in leaving my\r\nsister; but the nobler and the more generous path you have chosen has\r\nendeared you to us all."\r\n\r\n"Where is Flora now?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"She is in her own room. I have persuaded her, by some occupation, to\r\nwithdraw her mind from a too close and consequently painful\r\ncontemplation of the distressing circumstances in which she feels\r\nherself placed."\r\n\r\n"You are right. What occupation best pleases her?"\r\n\r\n"The pages of romance once had a charm for her gentle spirit."\r\n\r\n"Then come with me, and, from among the few articles I brought with me\r\nhere, I can find some papers which may help her to pass some merry\r\nhours."\r\n\r\nCharles took Henry to his room, and, unstrapping a small valise, he took\r\nfrom it some manuscript papers, one of which he handed to Henry,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n"Give that to her: it contains an account of a wild adventure, and shows\r\nthat human nature may suffer much more--and that wrongfully too--than\r\ncame ever under our present mysterious affliction."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Henry; "and, coming from you, I am sure it will have a\r\nmore than ordinary value in her eyes."\r\n\r\n"I will now," said Charles, "seek my uncle. I will tell him how I love\r\nher; and at the end of my narration, if he should not object, I would\r\nfain introduce her to him, that he might himself see that, let what\r\nbeauty may have met his gaze, her peer he never yet met with, and may in\r\nvain hope to do so."\r\n\r\n"You are partial, Charles."\r\n\r\n"Not so. \'Tis true I look upon her with a lover\'s eyes, but I look still\r\nwith those of truthful observation."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will speak to her about seeing your uncle, and let you know. No\r\ndoubt, he will not be at all averse to an interview with any one who\r\nstands high in your esteem."\r\n\r\nThe young men now separated--Henry, to seek his beautiful sister; and\r\nCharles, to communicate to his uncle the strange particulars connected\r\nwith Varney, the Vampyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFLORA IN HER CHAMBER.--HER FEARS.--THE MANUSCRIPT.--AN ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHenry found Flora in her chamber. She was in deep thought when he tapped\r\nat the door of the room, and such was the state of nervous excitement in\r\nwhich she was that even the demand for admission made by him to the room\r\nwas sufficient to produce from her a sudden cry of alarm.\r\n\r\n"Who--who is there?" she then said, in accents full of terror.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis I, dear Flora," said Henry.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door in an instant, and, with a feeling of grateful\r\nrelief, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Oh, Henry, is it only you?"\r\n\r\n"Who did you suppose it was, Flora?"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\r\n"I--I--do not know; but I am so foolish now, and so weak-spirited, that\r\nthe slightest noise is enough to alarm me."\r\n\r\n"You must, dear Flora, fight up, as I had hoped you were doing, against\r\nthis nervousness."\r\n\r\n"I will endeavour. Did not some strangers come a short time since,\r\nbrother?"\r\n\r\n"Strangers to us, Flora, but not to Charles Holland. A relative of\r\nhis--an uncle whom he much respects, has found him out here, and has now\r\ncome to see him."\r\n\r\n"And to advise him," said Flora, as she sunk into a chair, and wept\r\nbitterly; "to advise him, of course, to desert, as he would a\r\npestilence, a vampyre bride."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush! for the sake of Heaven, never make use of such a phrase,\r\nFlora. You know not what a pang it brings to my heart to hear you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, forgive me, brother."\r\n\r\n"Say no more of it, Flora. Heed it not. It may be possible--in fact, it\r\nmay well be supposed as more than probable--that the relative of Charles\r\nHolland may shrink from sanctioning the alliance, but do you rest\r\nsecurely in the possession of the heart which I feel convinced is wholly\r\nyours, and which, I am sure, would break ere it surrendered you."\r\n\r\nA smile of joy came across Flora\'s pale but beautiful face, as she\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n"And you, dear brother--you think so much of Charles\'s faith?"\r\n\r\n"As Heaven is my judge, I do."\r\n\r\n"Then I will bear up with what strength God may give me against all\r\nthings that seek to depress me; I will not be conquered."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Flora; I rejoice to find in you such a disposition. Here\r\nis some manuscript which Charles thinks will amuse you, and he bade me\r\nask you if you would be introduced to his uncle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--willingly."\r\n\r\n"I will tell him so; I know he wishes it, and I will tell him so. Be\r\npatient, dear Flora, and all may yet be well."\r\n\r\n"But, brother, on your sacred word, tell me do you not think this Sir\r\nFrancis Varney is the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I know not what to think, and do not press me for a judgment now. He\r\nshall be watched."\r\n\r\nHenry left his sister, and she sat for some moments in silence with the\r\npapers before her that Charles had sent her.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she then said, gently, "he loves me--Charles loves me; I ought to\r\nbe very, very happy. He loves me. In those words are concentrated a\r\nwhole world of joy--Charles loves me--he will not forsake me. Oh, was\r\nthere ever such dear love--such fond devotion?--never, never. Dear\r\nCharles. He loves me--he loves me!"\r\n\r\nThe very repetition of these words had a charm for Flora--a charm which\r\nwas sufficient to banish much sorrow; even the much-dreaded vampyre was\r\nforgotten while the light of love was beaming upon her, and she told\r\nherself,--\r\n\r\n"He is mine!--he is mine! He loves me truly."\r\n\r\nAfter a time, she turned to the manuscript which her brother had brought\r\nher, and, with a far greater concentration of mind than she had thought\r\nit possible she could bring to it, considering the many painful subjects\r\nof contemplation that she might have occupied herself with, she read the\r\npages with very great pleasure and interest.\r\n\r\nThe tale was one which chained her attention both by its incidents and\r\nthe manner of its recital. It commenced as follows, and was entitled,\r\n"Hugo de Verole; or, the Double Plot."\r\n\r\nIn a very mountainous part of Hungary lived a nobleman whose paternal\r\nestates covered many a mile of rock and mountain land, as well as some\r\nfertile valleys, in which reposed a hardy and contented peasantry. The\r\nold Count de Hugo de Verole had quitted life early, and had left his\r\nonly son, the then Count Hugo de Verole, a boy of scarcely ten years,\r\nunder the guardianship of his mother, an arbitrary and unscrupulous\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe count, her husband, had been one of those quiet, even-tempered men,\r\nwho have no desire to step beyond the sphere in which they are placed;\r\nhe had no cares, save those included in the management of his estate,\r\nthe prosperity of his serfs, and the happiness of those, around him.\r\n\r\nHis death caused much lamentation throughout his domains, it was so\r\nsudden and unexpected, being in the enjoyment of his health and strength\r\nuntil a few hours previous, and then his energies became prostrated by\r\npain and disease. There was a splendid funeral ceremony, which,\r\naccording to the usages of his house, took place by torch-light.\r\n\r\nSo great and rapid were the ravages of disease, that the count\'s body\r\nquickly became a mass of corruption. All were amazed at the phenomena,\r\nand were heartily glad when the body was disposed of in the place\r\nprepared for its reception in the vaults of his own castle. The guests\r\nwho came to witness the funeral, and attend the count\'s obsequies, and\r\nto condole with the widow on the loss she had sustained, were\r\nentertained sumptuously for many days.\r\n\r\nThe widow sustained her part well. She was inconsolable for the loss of\r\nher husband, and mourned his death bitterly. Her grief appeared\r\nprofound, but she, with difficulty, subdued it to within decent bounds,\r\nthat she might not offend any of her numerous guests.\r\n\r\nHowever, they left her with the assurances of their profound regard, and\r\nthen when they were gone, when the last guest had departed, and were no\r\nlonger visible to the eye of the countess, as she gazed from the\r\nbattlements, then her behaviour changed totally.\r\n\r\nShe descended from the battlements, and then with an imperious gesture\r\nshe gave her orders that all the gates of the castle should be closed,\r\nand a watch set. All signs of mourning she ordered to be laid on one\r\nside save her own, which she wore, and then she retired to her own\r\napartment, where she remained unseen.\r\n\r\nHere the countess remained in profound meditation for nearly two days,\r\nduring which time the attendants believed she was praying for the\r\nwelfare of the soul of their deceased master, and they feared she would\r\nstarve herself to death if she remained any longer.\r\n\r\nJust as they had assembled together for the purpose of either recalling\r\nher from her vigils or breaking open the door, they were amazed to see\r\nthe countess open the room-door, and stand in the midst of them.\r\n\r\n"What do you here?" she demanded, in a stern voice.\r\n\r\nThe servants were amazed and terrified at her contracted brow, and\r\nforgot to answer the question she put to them.\r\n\r\n"What do you do here?"\r\n\r\n"We came, my lady, to see--see--if--if you were well."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Because we hadn\'t seen your ladyship these two days, and we thought\r\nthat your grief was so excessive that we feared some harm might befall\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe countess\'s brows contracted for a few seconds, and she was about to\r\nmake a hasty reply, but she conquered the desire to do so, and merely\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"I am not well, I am faint; but, had I been dying, I should not have\r\nthanked you for interfering to prevent me; however, you acted for the\r\nbest, but do so no more. Now prepare me some food."\r\n\r\nThe servants, thus dismissed, repaired to their stations, but with such\r\na degree of alacrity, that they sufficiently showed how much they feared\r\ntheir mistress.\r\n\r\nThe young count, who was only in his sixth year, knew little about the\r\nloss he had sustained; but after a day or two\'s grief, there was an end\r\nof his sorrow for the time.\r\n\r\nThat night there came to the castle-gate a man dressed in a black cloak,\r\nattended by a servant. They were both mounted on good horses, and they\r\ndemanded to be admitted to the presence of the Countess de Hugo de\r\nVerole.\r\n\r\nThe message was carried to the countess, who started, but said,--\r\n\r\n"Admit the stranger."\r\n\r\nAccordingly the stranger was admitted, and shown into the apartment\r\nwhere the countess was sitting.\r\n\r\nAt a signal the servants retired, leaving the countess and the stranger\r\nalone. It was some moments ere they spoke, and then the countess said in\r\na low tone,--\r\n\r\n"You are come?"\r\n\r\n"I am come."\r\n\r\n"You cannot now, you see, perform your threat. My husband, the count,\r\ncaught a putrid disease, and he is no more."\r\n\r\n"I cannot indeed do what I intended, inform your husband of your amours;\r\nbut I can do something as good, and which will give you as much\r\nannoyance."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Aye, more, it will cause you to be hated. I can spread reports."\r\n\r\n"You can."\r\n\r\n"And these may ruin you."\r\n\r\n"They may."\r\n\r\n"What do you intend to do? Do you intend that I shall be an enemy or a\r\nfriend? I can be either, according to my will."\r\n\r\n"What, do you desire to be either?" inquired the countess, with a\r\ncareless tone.\r\n\r\n"If you refuse my terms, you can make me an implacable enemy, and if you\r\ngrant them, you can make me a useful friend and auxiliary," said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n"What would you do if you were my enemy?" inquired the countess.\r\n\r\n"It is hardly my place," said the stranger, "to furnish you with a\r\nknowledge of my intentions, but I will say this much, that the bankrupt\r\nCount of Morven is your lover."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"And in the second place, that you were the cause of the death of your\r\nhusband."\r\n\r\n"How dare you, sir--"\r\n\r\n"I dare say so much, and I dare say, also, that the Count of Morven\r\nbought the drug of me, and that he gave it to you, and that you gave it\r\nto the count your husband."\r\n\r\n"And what could you do if you were my friend?" inquired the countess, in\r\nthe same tone, and without emotion.\r\n\r\n"I should abstain from doing all this; should be able to put any one\r\nelse out of your way for you, when you get rid of this Count of Morven,\r\nas you assuredly will; for I know him too well not to be sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Get rid of him!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, in the same manner you got rid of the old count."\r\n\r\n"Then I accept your terms."\r\n\r\n"It is agreed, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you must order me some rooms in a tower, where I can pursue\r\nmy studies in quiet."\r\n\r\n"You will be seen--and noticed--all will be discovered."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I will take care of that, I can so far disguise myself that\r\nhe will not recognise me, and you can give out I am a philosopher or\r\nnecromancer, or what you will; no one will come to me--they will be\r\nterrified."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\n"And the gold?"\r\n\r\n"Shall be forthcoming as soon as I can get it. The count has placed all\r\nhis gold in safe keeping, and all I can seize are the rents as they\r\nbecome due."\r\n\r\n"Very well; but let me have them. In the meantime you must provide for\r\nme, as I have come here with the full intention of staying here, or in\r\nsome neighbouring town."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and my servant must be discharged, as I want none here."\r\n\r\nThe countess called to an attendant and gave the necessary orders, and\r\nafterwards remained some time with the stranger, who had thus so\r\nunceremoniously thrust himself upon her, and insisted upon staying under\r\nsuch strange and awful circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Count of Morven came a few weeks after, and remained some days with\r\nthe countess. They were ceremonious and polite until they had a moment\r\nto retire from before people, when the countess changed her cold disdain\r\nto a cordial and familiar address.\r\n\r\n"And now, my dear Morven," she exclaimed, as soon as they were\r\nunobserved--"and now, my dear Morven, that we are not seen, tell me,\r\nwhat have you been doing with yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I have been in some trouble. I never had gold that would stay by\r\nme. You know my hand was always open."\r\n\r\n"The old complaint again."\r\n\r\n"No; but having come to the end of my store, I began to grow serious."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Morven!\' said the countess, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind; when my purse is low my spirits sink, as the mercury\r\ndoes with the cold. You used to say my spirits were mercurial--I think\r\nthey were."\r\n\r\n"Well, what did you do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Was that what you were about to tell me?" inquired the countess.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no. You recollect the Italian quack of whom I bought the drug\r\nyou gave to the count, and which put an end to his days--he wanted more\r\nmoney. Well, as I had no more to spare, I could spare no more to him,\r\nand he turned vicious, and threatened. I threatened, too, and he knew I\r\nwas fully able and willing to perform any promise I might make to him on\r\nthat score. I endeavoured to catch him, as he had already began to set\r\npeople off on the suspicious and marvellous concerning me, and if I\r\ncould have come across him, I would have laid him very low indeed."\r\n\r\n"And you could not find him?"\r\n\r\n"No, I could not."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I will tell you where he is at this present moment."\r\n\r\n"You?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I."\r\n\r\n"I can scarcely credit my senses at what you say," said Count Morven.\r\n"My worthy doctor, you are little better than a candidate for divine\r\nhonours. But where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Will you promise to be guided by me?" said the countess.\r\n\r\n"If you make it a condition upon which you grant the information, I\r\nmust."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I take that as a promise."\r\n\r\n"You may. Where--oh, where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Remember your promise. Your doctor is at this moment in this castle."\r\n\r\n"This castle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, this castle."\r\n\r\n"Surely there must be some mistake; it is too much fortune at once."\r\n\r\n"He came here for the same purpose he went to you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to get more money by extortion, and a promise to poison anybody I\r\nliked."\r\n\r\n"D--n! it is the offer he made to me, and he named you."\r\n\r\n"He named you to me, and said I should be soon tired of you."\r\n\r\n"You have caged him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no; he has a suite of apartments in the eastern tower, where\r\nhe passes for a philosopher, or a wizard, as people like best."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"I have given him leave there."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and what is more amazing is, that he is to aid me in poisoning you\r\nwhen I have become tired of you."\r\n\r\n"This is a riddle I cannot unravel; tell me the solution."\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, listen,--he came to me and told me of something I already\r\nknew, and demanded money and a residence for his convenience, and I have\r\ngranted him the asylum."\r\n\r\n"You have?"\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"I see; I will give him an inch or two of my Andrea Ferrara."\r\n\r\n"No--no."\r\n\r\n"Do you countenance him?"\r\n\r\n"For a time. Listen--we want men in the mines; my late husband sent very\r\nfew to them of late years, and therefore they are getting short of men\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye."\r\n\r\n"The thing will be for you to feign ignorance of the man, and then you\r\nwill be able to get him seized, and placed in the mines, for such men as\r\nhe are dangerous, and carry poisoned weapons."\r\n\r\n"Would he not be better out of the world at once; there would be no\r\nescape, and no future contingencies?"\r\n\r\n"No--no. I will have no more lives taken; and he will be made useful;\r\nand, moreover, he will have time to reflect upon the mistake he had made\r\nin threatening me."\r\n\r\n"He was paid for the job, and he had no future claim. But what about the\r\nchild?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he may remain for some time longer here with us."\r\n\r\n"It will be dangerous to do so," said the count; "he is now ten years\r\nold, and there is no knowing what may be done for him by his relatives."\r\n\r\n"They dare not enter the gates of this castle Morven."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; but you know he might have travelled the same road as his\r\nfather, and all would be settled."\r\n\r\n"No more lives, as I told you; but we can easily secure him some other\r\nway, and we shall be equally as free from him and them."\r\n\r\n"That is enough--there are dungeons, I know, in this castle, and he can\r\nbe kept there safe enough."\r\n\r\n"He can; but that is not what I propose. We can put him into the mines\r\nand confine him as a lunatic."\r\n\r\n"Excellent!"\r\n\r\n"You see, we must make those mines more productive somehow or other;\r\nthey would be so, but the count would not hear of it; he said it was so\r\ninhuman, they were so destructive of life."\r\n\r\n"Paha! what were the mines intended for if not for use?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly--I often said so, but he always put a negative to it."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll make use of an affirmative, my dear countess, and see what will\r\nbe the result in a change of policy. By the way, when will our marriage\r\nbe celebrated?"\r\n\r\n"Not for some months."\r\n\r\n"How, so long? I am impatient."\r\n\r\n"You must restrain your impatience--but we must have the boy settled\r\nfirst, and the count will have been dead a longer time then, and we\r\nshall not give so much scandal to the weak-minded fools that were his\r\nfriends, for it will be dangerous to have so many events happen about\r\nthe same period."\r\n\r\n"You shall act as you think proper--but the first thing to be done will\r\nbe, to get this cunning doctor quietly out of the way."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I must contrive to have him seized, and carried to the mines."\r\n\r\n"Beneath the tower in which he lives is a trap-door and a vault, from\r\nwhich, by means of another trap and vault, is a long subterranean\r\npassage that leads to a door that opens into one end of the mines; near\r\nthis end live several men whom you must give some reward to, and they\r\nwill, by concert, seize him, and set him to work."\r\n\r\n"And if he will not work?"\r\n\r\n"Why, they will scourge him in such a manner, that he would be afraid\r\neven of a threat of a repetition of the same treatment."\r\n\r\n"That will do. But I think the worthy doctor will split himself with\r\nrage and malice, he will be like a caged tiger."\r\n\r\n"But he will be denuded of his teeth and claws," replied the countess,\r\nsmiling "therefore he will have leisure to repent of having threatened\r\nhis employers."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome weeks passed over, and the Count of Morven contrived to become\r\nacquainted with the doctor. They appeared to be utter strangers to each\r\nother, though each knew the other; the doctor having disguised himself,\r\nhe believed the disguise impenetrable and therefore sat at ease.\r\n\r\n"Worthy doctor," said the count to him, one day; "you have, no doubt, in\r\nyour studies, become acquainted with many of the secrets of science."\r\n\r\n"I have, my lord count; I may say there are few that are not known to\r\nFather Aldrovani. I have spent many years in research."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the midnight lamp has burned till the glorious sun has reached the\r\nhorizon, and brings back the day, and yet have I been found beside my\r\nbooks."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well; men like you should well know the value of the purest and\r\nmost valuable metals the earth produces?"\r\n\r\n"I know of but one--that is gold!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis what I mean."\r\n\r\n"But \'tis hard to procure from the bowels of the earth--from the heart\r\nof these mountains by which we are surrounded."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is true. But know you not the owners of this castle and\r\nterritory possess these mines and work them?"\r\n\r\n"I believe they do; but I thought they had discontinued working them\r\nsome years."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! that was given out to deceive the government, who claimed so\r\nmuch out of its products."\r\n\r\n"Oh! ah! aye, I see now."\r\n\r\n"And ever since they have been working it privately, and storing bars of\r\ngold up in the vaults of this--"\r\n\r\n"Here, in this castle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; beneath this very tower--it being the least frequented--the\r\nstrongest, and perfectly inaccessible from all sides, save the\r\ncastle--it was placed there for the safest deposit."\r\n\r\n"I see; and there is much gold deposited in the vaults?"\r\n\r\n"I believe there is an immense quantity in the vaults."\r\n\r\n"And what is your motive for telling me of this hoard of the precious\r\nmetal?"\r\n\r\n"Why, doctor, I thought that you or I could use a few bars; and that, if\r\nwe acted in concert, we might be able to take away, at various times,\r\nand secrete, in some place or other, enough to make us rich men for all\r\nour lives."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see this gold before I said anything about it,"\r\nreplied the doctor, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"As you please; do you find a lamp that will not go out by the sudden\r\ndraughts of air, or have the means of relighting it, and I will\r\naccompany you."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"This very night, good doctor, when you shall see such a golden harvest\r\nyou never yet hoped for, or even believed in."\r\n\r\n"To-night be it, then," replied the doctor. "I will have a lamp that\r\nwill answer our purpose, and some other matters."\r\n\r\n"Do, good doctor," and the count left the philosopher\'s cell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The plan takes," said the count to the countess, "give me the keys, and\r\nthe worthy man will be in safety before daylight."\r\n\r\n"Is he not suspicious?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night, about an hour before midnight,--the Count Morven stole\r\ntowards the philosopher\'s room. He tapped at the door.\r\n\r\n"Enter," said the philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe count entered, and saw the philosopher seated, and by him a lamp of\r\npeculiar construction, and incased in gauze wire, and a cloak.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready?" inquired the count.\r\n\r\n"Quite," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Is that your lamp?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"Follow me, then, and hold the lamp tolerably high, as the way is\r\nstrange, and the steps steep."\r\n\r\n"Lead on."\r\n\r\n"You have made up your mind, I dare say, as to what share of the\r\nundertaking you will accept of with me."\r\n\r\n"And what if I will not?" said the philosopher, coolly.\r\n\r\n"It falls to the ground, and I return the keys to their place."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I shall not refuse, if you have not deceived me as to the\r\nquantity and purity of the metal they have stored up."\r\n\r\n"I am no judge of these metals, doctor. I am no assayest; but I believe\r\nyou will find what I have to show you will far exceed your expectations\r\non that head."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well: proceed."\r\n\r\nThey had now got to the first vault, in which stood the first door, and,\r\nwith some difficulty, they opened the vault door.\r\n\r\n"It has not been opened for some time," said the philosopher.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, they seldom used to go here, from what I can learn,\r\nthough it is kept a great secret."\r\n\r\n"And we can keep it so, likewise."\r\n\r\n"True."\r\n\r\nThey now entered the vault, and came to the second door, which opened\r\ninto a kind of flight of steps, cut out of the solid rock, and then\r\nalong a passage cut out of the mountain, of some kind of stone, but not\r\nso hard as the rock itself.\r\n\r\n"You see," said the count, "what care has been taken to isolate the\r\nplace, and detach it from the castle, so that it should not be dependent\r\nupon the possessor of the castle. This is the last door but one, and now\r\nprepare yourself for a surprise, doctor, this will be an extraordinary\r\none."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the count opened the door, and stepped on one side, when the\r\ndoctor approached the place, and was immediately thrust forward by the\r\ncount and he rolled down some steps into the mine, and was immediately\r\nseized by some of the miners, who had been stationed there for that\r\npurpose, and carried to a distant part of the mine, there to work for\r\nthe remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nThe count, seeing all secure, refastened the doors, and returned to the\r\ncastle. A few weeks after this the body of a youth, mangled and\r\ndisfigured, was brought to the castle, which the countess said was her\r\nson\'s body.\r\n\r\nThe count had immediately secured the real heir, and thrust him into the\r\nmines, there to pass a life of labour and hopeless misery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a high feast held. The castle gates were thrown open, and\r\neverybody who came were entertained without question.\r\n\r\nThis was on the occasion of the count\'s and countess\'s marriage. It\r\nseemed many months after the death of her son, whom she affected to\r\nmourn for a long time.\r\n\r\nHowever, the marriage took place, and in all magnificence and splendour.\r\nThe countess again appeared arrayed in splendour and beauty: she was\r\nproud and haughty, and the count was imperious.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the young Count de Hugo de Verole was confined in the\r\nmines, and the doctor with him.\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence, the doctor and the young count became\r\ncompanions, and the former, meditating projects of revenge, educated the\r\nyoung count as well as he was able for several years in the mines, and\r\ncherished in the young man a spirit of revenge. They finally escaped\r\ntogether, and proceeded to Leyden, where the doctor had friends, and\r\nwhere he placed his pupil at the university, and thus made him a most\r\nefficient means of revenge, because the education of the count gave him\r\na means of appreciating the splendour and rank he had been deprived of.\r\nHe, therefore, determined to remain at Leyden until he was of age, and\r\nthen apply to his father\'s friends, and then to his sovereign, to\r\ndispossess and punish them both for their double crime.\r\n\r\nThe count and countess lived on in a state of regal splendour. The\r\nimmense revenue of his territory, and the treasure the late count had\r\namassed, as well as the revenue that the mines brought in, would have\r\nsupported a much larger expenditure than even their tastes disposed them\r\nto enjoy.\r\n\r\nThey had heard nothing of the escape of the doctor and the young count.\r\nIndeed, those who knew of it held their peace and said nothing about it,\r\nfor they feared the consequences of their negligence. The first\r\nintimation they received was at the hands of a state messenger,\r\nsummoning them to deliver up the castle revenues and treasure of the\r\nlate count.\r\n\r\nThis was astounding to them, and they refused to do so, but were soon\r\nafter seized upon by a regiment of cuirassiers sent to take them, and\r\nthey were accused of the crime of murder at the instance of the doctor.\r\n\r\nThey were arraigned and found guilty, and, as they were of the patrician\r\norder, their execution was delayed, and they were committed to exile.\r\nThis was done out of favour to the young count, who did not wish to have\r\nhis family name tainted by a public execution, or their being confined\r\nlike convicts.\r\n\r\nThe count and countess quitted Hungary, and settled in Italy, where they\r\nlived upon the remains of the Count of Morven\'s property, shorn of all\r\ntheir splendour but enough to keep them from being compelled to do any\r\nmenial office.\r\n\r\nThe young count took possession of his patrimony and his treasure at\r\nlast, such as was left by his mother and her paramour.\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued to hide his crime from the young count, and the\r\nperpetrators denying all knowledge of it, he escaped; but he returned to\r\nhis native place, Leyden, with a reward for his services from the young\r\ncount.\r\n\r\nFlora rose from her perusal of the manuscript, which here ended, and\r\neven as she did so, she heard a footstep approaching her chamber door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE DREADFUL MISTAKE.--THE TERRIFIC INTERVIEW IN THE CHAMBER.--THE\r\nATTACK OF THE VAMPYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe footstep which Flora, upon the close of the tale she had been\r\nreading, heard approaching her apartment, came rapidly along the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n"It is Henry, returned to conduct me to an interview with Charles\'s\r\nuncle," she said. "I wonder, now, what manner of man he is. He should in\r\nsome respects resemble Charles; and if he do so, I shall bestow upon him\r\nsome affection for that alone."\r\n\r\nTap--tap came upon the chamber door. Flora was not at all alarmed now,\r\nas she had been when Henry brought her the manuscript. From some strange\r\naction of the nervous system, she felt quite confident, and resolved to\r\nbrave everything. But then she felt quite sure that it was Henry, and\r\nbefore the knocking had taken her by surprise.\r\n\r\n"Come in," she said, in a cheerful voice. "Come in."\r\n\r\nThe door opened with wonderful swiftness--a figure stepped into the\r\nroom, and then closed it as rapidly, and stood against it. Flora tried\r\nto scream, but her tongue refused its office; a confused whirl of\r\nsensations passed through her brain--she trembled, and an icy coldness\r\ncame over her. It was Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre!\r\n\r\nHe had drawn up his tall, gaunt frame to its full height, and crossed\r\nhis arms upon his breast; there was a hideous smile upon his sallow\r\ncountenance, and his voice was deep and sepulchral, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"Flora Bannerworth, hear that which I have to say, and hear it calmly.\r\nYou need have nothing to fear. Make an alarm--scream, or shout for help,\r\nand, by the hell beneath us, you are lost!"\r\n\r\nThere was a death-like, cold, passionless manner about the utterance of\r\nthese words, as if they were spoken mechanically, and came from no human\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nFlora heard them, and yet scarcely comprehended them; she stepped slowly\r\nback till she reached a chair, and there she held for support. The only\r\npart of the address of Varney that thoroughly reached her ears, was that\r\nif she gave any alarm some dreadful consequences were to ensue. But it\r\nwas not on account of these words that she really gave no alarm; it was\r\nbecause she was utterly unable to do so.\r\n\r\n"Answer me," said Varney. "Promise that you will hear that which I have\r\nto say. In so promising you commit yourself to no evil, and you shall\r\nhear that which shall give you much peace."\r\n\r\nIt was in vain she tried to speak; her lips moved, but she uttered no\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n"You are terrified," said Varney, "and yet I know not why. I do not come\r\nto do you harm, although harm have you done me. Girl, I come to rescue\r\nyou from a thraldom of the soul under which you now labour."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some moments\' duration, and then, faintly, Flora\r\nmanaged to say,--\r\n\r\n"Help! help! Oh, help me, Heaven!"\r\n\r\nVarney made a gesture of impatience, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"Heaven works no special matters now. Flora Bannerworth, if you have as\r\nmuch intellect as your nobility and beauty would warrant the world in\r\nsupposing, you will listen to me."\r\n\r\n"I--I hear," said Flora, as she still, dragging the chair with her,\r\nincreased the distance between them.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well. You are now more composed."\r\n\r\nShe fixed her eyes upon the face of Varney with a shudder. There could\r\nbe no mistake. It was the same which, with the strange, glassy looking\r\neyes, had glared upon her on that awful night of the storm when she was\r\nvisited by the vampyre. And Varney returned that gaze unflinchingly\r\nThere was a hideous and strange contortion of his face now as he said,--\r\n\r\n"You are beautiful. The most cunning statuary might well model some rare\r\nwork of art from those rounded limbs, that were surely made to bewitch\r\nthe gazer. Your skin rivals the driven snow--what a face of loveliness,\r\nand what a form of enchantment."\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but a thought came across her mind, which at once\r\ncrimsoned her cheek--she knew she had fainted on the first visit of the\r\nvampyre, and now he, with a hideous reverence, praised beauties which he\r\nmight have cast his demoniac eyes over at such a time.\r\n\r\n"You understand me," he said. "Well, let that pass. I am something\r\nallied to humanity yet."\r\n\r\n"Speak your errand," gasped Flora, "or come what may, I scream for help\r\nto those who will not be slow to render it."\r\n\r\n"I know it."\r\n\r\n"You know I will scream?"\r\n\r\n"No; you will hear me. I know they would not be slow to tender help to\r\nyou, but you will not call for it; I will present to you no necessity."\r\n\r\n"Say on--say on."\r\n\r\n"You perceive I do not attempt to approach you; my errand is one of\r\npeace."\r\n\r\n"Peace from you! Horrible being, if you be really what even now my\r\nappalled imagination shrinks from naming you, would not even to you\r\nabsolute annihilation be a blessing?"\r\n\r\n"Peace, peace. I came not here to talk on such a subject. I must be\r\nbrief, Flora Bannerworth, for time presses. I do not hate you. Wherefore\r\nshould I? You are young, and you are beautiful, and you bear a name\r\nwhich should command, and does command, some portion of my best regard."\r\n\r\n"There is a portrait," said Flora, "in this house."\r\n\r\n"No more--no more. I know what you would say."\r\n\r\n"It is yours."\r\n\r\n"The house, and all within, I covet," he said, uneasily. "Let that\r\nsuffice. I have quarrelled with your brother--I have quarrelled with one\r\nwho just now fancies he loves you."\r\n\r\n"Charles Holland loves me truly."\r\n\r\n"It does not suit me now to dispute that point with you. I have the\r\nmeans of knowing more of the secrets of the human heart than common men.\r\nI tell you, Flora Bannerworth, that he who talks to you of love, loves\r\nyou not but with the fleeting fancy of a boy; and there is one who hides\r\ndeep in his heart a world of passion, one who has never spoken to you of\r\nlove, and yet who loves you with a love as far surpassing the evanescent\r\nfancy of this boy Holland, as does the mighty ocean the most placid lake\r\nthat ever basked in idleness beneath a summer\'s sun."\r\n\r\nThere was a wonderful fascination in the manner now of Varney. His voice\r\nsounded like music itself. His words flowed from his tongue, each gently\r\nand properly accented, with all the charm of eloquence.\r\n\r\nDespite her trembling horror of that man--despite her fearful opinion,\r\nwhich might be said to amount to a conviction of what he really was,\r\nFlora felt an irresistible wish to hear him speak on. Ay, despite too,\r\nthe ungrateful theme to her heart which he had now chosen as the subject\r\nof his discourse, she felt her fear of him gradually dissipating, and\r\nnow when he made a pause, she said,--\r\n\r\n"You are much mistaken. On the constancy and truth of Charles Holland, I\r\nwould stake my life."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Have you spoken now that which you had to say?"\r\n\r\n"No, no. I tell you I covet this place, I would purchase it, but having\r\nwith your bad-tempered brothers quarrelled, they will hold no further\r\nconverse with me."\r\n\r\n"And well they may refuse."\r\n\r\n"Be, that as it may, sweet lady, I come to you to be my mediator. In the\r\nshadow of the future I can see many events which are to come."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"It is so. Borrowing some wisdom from the past, and some from resources\r\nI would not detail to you, I know that if I have inflicted much misery\r\nupon you, I can spare you much more. Your brother or your lover will\r\nchallenge me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no."\r\n\r\n"I say such will happen, and I can kill either. My skill as well as my\r\nstrength is superhuman."\r\n\r\n"Mercy! mercy!" gasped Flora. "I will spare either or both on a\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"What fearful condition?"\r\n\r\n"It is not a fearful one. Your terrors go far before the fact. All I\r\nwish, maiden, of you is to induce these imperious brothers of yours to\r\nsell or let the Hall to me."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\n"It is. I ask no more, and, in return, I promise you not only that I\r\nwill not fight with them, but that you shall never see me again. Rest\r\nsecurely, maiden, you will be undisturbed by me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, God! that were indeed an assurance worth the striving for," said\r\nFlora.\r\n\r\n"It is one you may have. But--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I knew--my heart told me there was yet some fearful condition to\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong again. I only ask of you that you keep this meeting a\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no--I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Nay, what so easy?"\r\n\r\n"I will not; I have no secrets from those I love."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, you will find soon the expediency of a few at least; but if you\r\nwill not, I cannot urge it longer. Do as your wayward woman\'s nature\r\nprompts you."\r\n\r\nThere was a slight, but a very slight, tone of aggravation in these\r\nwords, and the manner in which they were uttered.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he moved from the door towards the window, which opened\r\ninto a kitchen garden. Flora shrunk as far from him as possible, and for\r\na few moments they regarded each other in silence.\r\n\r\n"Young blood," said Varney, "mantles in your veins."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered with terror.\r\n\r\n"Be mindful of the condition I have proposed to you. I covet Bannerworth\r\nHall."\r\n\r\n"I--I hear."\r\n\r\n"And I must have it. I will have it, although my path to it be through a\r\nsea of blood. You understand me, maiden? Repeat what has passed between\r\nus or not, as you please. I say, beware of me, if you keep not the\r\ncondition I have proposed."\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows that this place is becoming daily more hateful to us all,"\r\nsaid Flora.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"You well might know so much. It is no sacrifice to urge it now. I will\r\nurge my brother."\r\n\r\n"Thanks--a thousand thanks. You may not live to regret even having made\r\na friend of Varney--"\r\n\r\n"The vampyre!" said Flora.\r\n\r\nHe advanced towards her a step, and she involuntarily uttered a scream\r\nof terror.\r\n\r\nIn an instant his hand clasped her waist with the power of an iron vice;\r\nshe felt hit hot breath flushing on her cheek. Her senses reeled, and\r\nshe found herself sinking. She gathered all her breath and all her\r\nenergies into one piercing shriek, and then she fell to the floor. There\r\nwas a sudden crash of broken glass, and then all was still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNCLE AND NEPHEW, AND THE ALARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles Holland had taken his uncle by the arm, and led him\r\ninto a private room.\r\n\r\n"Dear uncle," he said, "be seated, and I will explain everything without\r\nreserve."\r\n\r\n"Seated!--nonsense! I\'ll walk about," said the admiral. "D--n me! I\'ve\r\nno patience to be seated, and very seldom had or have. Go on now, you\r\nyoung scamp."\r\n\r\n"Well--well; you abuse me, but I am quite sure, had you been in my\r\nsituation, you would have acted precisely as I have done."\r\n\r\n"No, I shouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, but, uncle--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think to come over me by calling me uncle. Hark you,\r\nCharles--from this moment I won\'t be your uncle any more."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t very well. And how dare you, you buccaneer, call me sir, eh? I\r\nsay, how dare you?"\r\n\r\n"I will call you anything you like."\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t be called anything I like. You might as well call me at\r\nonce Morgan, the Pirate, for he was called anything he liked. Hilloa,\r\nsir! how dare you laugh, eh? I\'ll teach you to laugh at me. I wish I had\r\nyou on board ship--that\'s all, you young rascal. I\'d soon teach you to\r\nlaugh at your superior officer, I would."\r\n\r\n"Oh, uncle, I did not laugh at you."\r\n\r\n"What did you laugh at, then?"\r\n\r\n"At the joke."\r\n\r\n"Joke. D--n me, there was no joke at all!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very good."\r\n\r\n"And it ain\'t very good."\r\n\r\nCharles knew very well that, this sort of humour, in which was the old\r\nadmiral, would soon pass away, and then that he would listen to him\r\ncomfortably enough; so he would not allow the least exhibition of\r\npetulance or mere impatience to escape himself, but contented himself by\r\nwaiting until the ebullition of feeling fairly worked itself out.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," at length said the old man, "you have dragged me here,\r\ninto a very small and a very dull room, under pretence of having\r\nsomething to tell me, and I have heard nothing yet."\r\n\r\n"Then I will now tell you," said Charles. "I fell in love--"\r\n\r\n"Bah!"\r\n\r\n"With Flora Bannerworth, abroad; she is not only the most beautiful of\r\ncreated beings--"\r\n\r\n"Bah!"\r\n\r\n"But her mind is of the highest order of intelligence, honour, candour,\r\nand all amiable feelings--"\r\n\r\n"Bah!"\r\n\r\n"Really, uncle, if you say \'Bah!\' to everything, I cannot go on."\r\n\r\n"And what the deuce difference, sir, does it make to you, whether I say\r\n\'Bah!\' or not?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I love her. She came to England, and, as I could not exist, but\r\nwas getting ill, and should, no doubt, have died if I had not done so, I\r\ncame to England."\r\n\r\n"But d----e, I want to know about the mermaid."\r\n\r\n"The vampyre, you mean, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Then, uncle, all I can tell you is, that it is supposed a vampyre came\r\none night and inflicted a wound upon Flora\'s neck with his teeth, and\r\nthat he is still endeavouring to renew his horrible existence from the\r\nyoung, pure blood that flows through her veins."\r\n\r\n"The devil he is!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I am bewildered, I must confess, by the mass of circumstances that\r\nhave combined to give the affair a horrible truthfulness. Poor Flora is\r\nmuch injured in health and spirits; and when I came home, she, at once,\r\nimplored me to give her up, and think of her no more, for she could not\r\nthink of allowing me to unite my fate with hers, under such\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"She did?"\r\n\r\n"Such were her words, uncle. She implored me--she used that word,\r\n\'implore\'--to fly from her, to leave her to her fate, to endeavour to\r\nfind happiness with some one else."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"But I saw her heart was breaking."\r\n\r\n"What o\' that?"\r\n\r\n"Much of that, uncle. I told her that when I deserted her in the hour of\r\nmisfortune that I hoped Heaven would desert me. I told her that if her\r\nhappiness was wrecked, to cling yet to me, and that with what power and\r\nwhat strength God had given me, I would stand between her and all ill."\r\n\r\n"And what then?"\r\n\r\n"She--she fell upon my breast and wept and blessed me. Could I desert\r\nher--could I say to her, \'My dear girl, when you were full of health and\r\nbeauty, I loved you, but now that sadness is at your heart I leave you?\'\r\nCould I tell her that, uncle, and yet call myself a man?"\r\n\r\n"No!" roared the old admiral, in a voice that made the room echo again;\r\n"and I tell you what, if you had done so, d--n you, you puppy, I\'d have\r\nbraced you, and--and married the girl myself. I would, d----e, but I\r\nwould."\r\n\r\n"Dear uncle!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t dear me, sir. Talk of deserting a girl when the signal of\r\ndistress, in the shape of a tear, is in her eye!"\r\n\r\n"But I--"\r\n\r\n"You are a wretch--a confounded lubberly boy--a swab--a d----d bad\r\ngrampus."\r\n\r\n"You mistake, uncle."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. God bless you, Charles, you shall have her--if a whole\r\nship\'s crew of vampyres said no, you shall have her. Let me see\r\nher--just let me see her."\r\n\r\nThe admiral gave his lips a vigorous wipe with his sleeve, and Charles\r\nsaid hastily,--\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle, you will recollect that Miss Bannerworth is quite a\r\nyoung lady."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, for God\'s sake, don\'t attempt to kiss her."\r\n\r\n"Not kiss her! d----e, they like it. Not kiss her, because she\'s a young\r\nlady! D----e, do you think I\'d kiss a corporal of marines?"\r\n\r\n"No, uncle; but you know young ladies are very delicate."\r\n\r\n"And ain\'t I delicate--shiver my timbers, ain\'t I delicate? Where is\r\nshe? that\'s what I want to know."\r\n\r\n"Then you approve of what I have done?"\r\n\r\n"You are a young scamp, but you have got some of the old admiral\'s\r\nfamily blood in you, so don\'t take any credit for acting like an honest\r\nman--you couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"But if I had not so acted," said Charles, with a smile, "what would\r\nhave become of the family blood, then?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you? I would have disowned you, because that very thing\r\nwould have convinced me you were an impostor, and did not belong to the\r\nfamily at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, that would have been one way of getting over the difficulty."\r\n\r\n"No difficulty at all. The man who deserts the good ship that carries\r\nhim through the waves, or the girl that trusts her heart to him, ought\r\nto be chopped up into meat for wild monkeys."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think so to."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s so d----d reasonable that, being a nephew of mine, you\r\ncan\'t possibly help it."\r\n\r\n"Bravo, uncle! I had no idea you were so argumentative."\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you, spooney; you\'d be an ornament to the gun-room, you would;\r\nbut where\'s the \'young lady\' who is so infernal delicate--where is she,\r\nI say?"\r\n\r\n"I will fetch her, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Ah, do; I\'ll be bound, now, she\'s one of the right build--a good\r\nfigure-head, and don\'t make too much stern-way."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Well, well, whatever you do, now don\'t pay her any compliments, for\r\nyour efforts in that line are of such a very doubtful order, that I\r\nshall dread to hear you."\r\n\r\n"You be off, and mind your own business; I haven\'t been at sea forty\r\nyears without picking up some out-and-out delicate compliments to say to\r\na young lady."\r\n\r\n"But do you really imagine, now, that the deck of a man-of-war is a nice\r\nplace to pick up courtly compliments in?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. There you hear the best of language, d----e! You don\'t\r\nknow what you are talking about, you fellows that have stuck on shore\r\nall your lives; it\'s we seamen who learn life."\r\n\r\n"Well, well--hark!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"A cry--did you not hear a cry?"\r\n\r\n"A signal of distress, by G--d!"\r\n\r\nIn their efforts to leave the room, the uncle and nephew for about a\r\nminute actually blocked up the door-way, but the superior bulk of the\r\nadmiral prevailed, and after nearly squeezing poor Charles flat, he got\r\nout first.\r\n\r\nBut this did not avail him, for he knew not where to go. Now, the second\r\nscream which Flora had uttered when the vampyre had clasped her waist\r\ncame upon their ears, and, as they were outside the room, it acted well\r\nas a guide in which direction to come.\r\n\r\nCharles fancied correctly enough at once that it proceeded from the room\r\nwhich was called "Flora\'s own room," and thitherward accordingly he\r\ndashed at tremendous speed.\r\n\r\nHenry, however, happened to be nearer at hand, and, moreover, he did not\r\nhesitate a moment, because he knew that Flora was in her own room; so he\r\nreached it first, and Charles saw him rush in a few moments before he\r\ncould reach the room.\r\n\r\nThe difference of time, however, was very slight, and Henry had only\r\njust raised Flora from the floor as Charles appeared.\r\n\r\n"God of Heaven!" cried the latter, "what has happened?"\r\n\r\n"I know not," said Henry; "as God is my judge, I know not. Flora, Flora,\r\nspeak to us! Flora! Flora!"\r\n\r\n"She has fainted!" cried Charles. "Some water may restore her. Oh,\r\nHenry, Henry, is not this horrible?"\r\n\r\n"Courage! courage!" said Henry although his voice betrayed what a\r\nterrible state of anxiety he was himself in; "you will find water in\r\nthat decanter, Charles. Here is my mother, too! Another visit! God help\r\nus!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth sat down on the edge of the sofa which was in the room,\r\nand could only wring her hands and weep.\r\n\r\n"Avast!" cried the admiral, making his appearance. "Where\'s the enemy,\r\nlads?"\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said Charles, "uncle, uncle, the vampyre has been here\r\nagain--the dreadful vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"D--n me, and he\'s gone, too, and carried half the window with him. Look\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nIt was literally true; the window, which was a long latticed one, was\r\nsmashed through.\r\n\r\n"Help! oh, help!" said Flora, as the water that was dashed in her face\r\nbegan to recover her.\r\n\r\n"You are safe!" cried Henry, "you are safe!"\r\n\r\n"Flora," said Charles; "you know my voice, dear Flora? Look up, and you\r\nwill see there are none here but those who love you."\r\n\r\nFlora opened her eyes timidly as the said,--\r\n\r\n"Has it gone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, dear," said Charles. "Look around you; here are none but true\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"And tried friends, my dear," said Admiral Bell, "excepting me; and\r\nwhenever you like to try me, afloat or ashore, d--n me, shew me Old Nick\r\nhimself, and I won\'t shrink--yard arm and yard arm--grapnel to\r\ngrapnel--pitch pots and grenades!"\r\n\r\n"This is my uncle, Flora," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, sir," said Flora, faintly.\r\n\r\n"All right!" whispered the admiral to Charles; "what a figure-head, to\r\nbe sure! Poll at Swansea would have made just about four of her, but she\r\nwasn\'t so delicate, d--n me!"\r\n\r\n"I should think not."\r\n\r\n"You are right for once in a way, Charley."\r\n\r\n"What was it that alarmed you?" said Charles, tenderly, as he now took\r\none of Flora\'s hands in his.\r\n\r\n"Varney--Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Varney!" exclaimed Henry; "Varney here!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came in at that door: and when I screamed, I suppose--for I\r\nhardly was conscious--he darted out through the window."\r\n\r\n"This," said Henry, "is beyond all human patience. By Heaven! I cannot\r\nand will not endure it."\r\n\r\n"It shall be my quarrel," said Charles; "I shall go at once and defy\r\nhim. He shall meet me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no," said Flora, as she clung convulsively to Charles. "No,\r\nno; there is a better way."\r\n\r\n"What way?"\r\n\r\n"The place has become full of terrors. Let us leave it. Let him, as he\r\nwishes, have it."\r\n\r\n"Let _him_ have it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. God knows, if it purchase an immunity from these visits, we\r\nmay well be overjoyed. Remember that we have ample reason to believe him\r\nmore than human. Why should you allow yourselves to risk a personal\r\nencounter with such a man, who might be glad to kill you that he might\r\nhave an opportunity of replenishing his own hideous existence from your\r\nbest heart\'s blood?"\r\n\r\nThe young men looked aghast.\r\n\r\n"Besides," added Flora, "you cannot tell what dreadful powers of\r\nmischief he may have, against which human courage might be of no avail."\r\n\r\n"There is truth and reason," said Mr. Marchdale, stepping forward, "in\r\nwhat Flora says."\r\n\r\n"Only let me come across him, that\'s all," said Admiral Bell, "and I\'ll\r\nsoon find out what he is. I suppose he\'s some long slab of a lubber\r\nafter all, ain\'t he, with no strength."\r\n\r\n"His strength is immense," said Marchdale. "I tried to seize him, and I\r\nfell beneath his arm as if I had been struck by the hammer of a\r\nCyclops."\r\n\r\n"A what?" cried the admiral.\r\n\r\n"A Cyclops."\r\n\r\n"D--n me, I served aboard the Cyclops eleven years, and never saw a very\r\nbig hammer aboard of her."\r\n\r\n"What on earth is to be done?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Oh," chimed in the admiral, "there\'s always a bother about what\'s to be\r\ndone on earth. Now, at sea, I could soon tell you what was to be done."\r\n\r\n"We must hold a solemn consultation over this matter," said Henry. "You\r\nare safe now, Flora."\r\n\r\n"Oh, be ruled by me. Give up the Hall."\r\n\r\n"You tremble."\r\n\r\n"I do tremble, brother, for what may yet ensue. I implore you to give up\r\nthe Hall. It is but a terror to us now--give it up. Have no more to do\r\nwith it. Let us make terms with Sir Francis Varney. Remember, we dare\r\nnot kill him."\r\n\r\n"He ought to be smothered," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"It is true," remarked Henry, "we dare not, even holding all the\r\nterrible suspicions we do, take his life."\r\n\r\n"By foul means certainly not," said Charles, "were he ten times a\r\nvampyre. I cannot, however, believe that he is so invulnerable as he is\r\nrepresented."\r\n\r\n"No one represents him here," said Marchdale. "I speak, sir, because I\r\nsaw you glance at me. I only know that, having made two unsuccessful\r\nattempts to seize him, he eluded me, once by leaving in my grasp a piece\r\nof his coat, and the next time he struck me down, and I feel yet the\r\neffects of the terrific blow."\r\n\r\n"You hear?" said Flora.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hear," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"For some reason," added Marchdale, in a tone of emotion, "what I say\r\nseems to fall always badly upon Mr. Holland\'s ear. I know not why; but\r\nif it will give him any satisfaction, I will leave Bannerworth Hall\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said Henry; "for the love of Heaven, do not let us\r\nquarrel."\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear," cried the admiral. "We can never fight the enemy well if\r\nthe ship\'s crew are on bad terms. Come now, you Charles, this appears to\r\nbe an honest, gentlemanly fellow--give him your hand."\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Charles Holland," said Marchdale, "knows aught to my prejudice\r\nin any way, however slight, I here beg of him to declare it at once, and\r\nopenly."\r\n\r\n"I cannot assert that I do," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Then what the deuce do you make yourself so disagreeable for, eh?"\r\ncried the admiral.\r\n\r\n"One cannot help one\'s impression and feelings," said Charles; "but I am\r\nwilling to take Mr. Marchdale\'s hand."\r\n\r\n"And I yours, young sir," said Marchdale, "in all sincerity of spirit,\r\nand with good will towards you."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands; but it required no conjuror to perceive that it was\r\nnot done willingly or cordially. It was a handshaking of that character\r\nwhich seemed to imply on each side, "I don\'t like you, but I don\'t know\r\npositively any harm of you."\r\n\r\n"There now," said the admiral, "that\'s better."\r\n\r\n"Now, let us hold counsel about this Varney," said Henry. "Come to the\r\nparlour all of you, and we will endeavour to come to some decided\r\narrangement."\r\n\r\n"Do not weep, mother," said Flora. "All may yet be well. We will leave\r\nthis place."\r\n\r\n"We will consider that question, Flora," said Henry; "and believe me\r\nyour wishes will go a long way with all of us, as you may well suppose\r\nthey always would."\r\n\r\nThey left Mrs. Bannerworth with Flora, and proceeded to the small oaken\r\nparlour, in which were the elaborate and beautiful carvings which have\r\nbeen before mentioned.\r\n\r\nHenry\'s countenance, perhaps, wore the most determined expression of\r\nall. He appeared now as if he had thoroughly made up his mind to do\r\nsomething which should have a decided tendency to put a stop to the\r\nterrible scenes which were now day by day taking place beneath that\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland looked serious and thoughtful, as if he were revolving\r\nsome course of action in his mind concerning which he was not quite\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale was more sad and depressed, to all appearance, than any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs for the admiral, he was evidently in a state of amazement, and knew\r\nnot what to think. He was anxious to do something, and yet what that was\r\nto be he had not the most remote idea, any more than as if he was not at\r\nall cognisant of any of those circumstances, every one of which was so\r\ncompletely out of the line of his former life and experience.\r\n\r\nGeorge had gone to call on Mr. Chillingworth, so he was not present at\r\nthe first part of this serious council of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULTATION.--THE DETERMINATION TO LEAVE THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis was certainly the most seriously reasonable meeting which had been\r\nheld at Bannerworth Hall on the subject of the much dreaded vampyre. The\r\nabsolute necessity for doing something of a decisive character was\r\nabundantly apparent, and when Henry promised Flora that her earnest wish\r\nto leave the house should not be forgotten as an element in the\r\ndiscussion which was about to ensue, it was with a rapidly growing\r\nfeeling on his own part, to the effect that that house, associated even\r\nas it was with many endearing recollections, was no home for him.\r\n\r\nHence he was the more inclined to propose a departure from the Hall if\r\nit could possibly be arranged satisfactorily in a pecuniary point of\r\nview. The pecuniary point of view, however, in which Henry was compelled\r\nto look at the subject, was an important and a troublesome one.\r\n\r\nWe have already hinted at the very peculiar state of the finances of the\r\nfamily; and, in fact, although the income derivable from various sources\r\nought to have been amply sufficient to provide Henry, and those who were\r\ndependent upon him, with a respectable livelihood, yet it was nearly all\r\nswallowed up by the payment of regular instalments upon family debts\r\nincurred by his father. And the creditors took great credit to\r\nthemselves that they allowed of such an arrangement, instead of sweeping\r\noff all before them, and leaving the family to starve.\r\n\r\nThe question, therefore, or, at all events, one of the questions, now\r\nwas, how far would a departure from the Hall of him, Henry, and the\r\nother branches of the family, act upon that arrangement?\r\n\r\nDuring a very few minutes\' consideration, Henry, with the frank and\r\ncandid disposition which was so strong a characteristic of his\r\ncharacter, made up his mind to explain all this fully to Charles Holland\r\nand his uncle.\r\n\r\nWhen once he formed such a determination he was not likely to be slow in\r\ncarrying it into effect, and no sooner, then, were the whole of them\r\nseated in the small oaken parlour than he made an explicit statement of\r\nhis circumstances.\r\n\r\n"But," said Mr. Marchdale, when he had done, "I cannot see what right\r\nyour creditors have to complain of where you live, so long as you\r\nperform your contract to them."\r\n\r\n"True; but they always expected me, I knew, to remain at the Hall, and\r\nif they chose, why, of course, at any time, they could sell off the\r\nwhole property for what it would fetch, and pay themselves as far as the\r\nproceeds would go. At all events, I am quite certain there could be\r\nnothing at all left for me."\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine," added Mr. Marchdale, "that any men could be so\r\nunreasonable."\r\n\r\n"It is scarcely to be borne," remarked Charles Holland, with more\r\nimpatience than he usually displayed, "that a whole family are to be put\r\nto the necessity of leaving their home for no other reason than the\r\nbeing pestered by such a neighbour as Sir Francis Varney. It makes one\r\nimpatient and angry to reflect upon such a state of things."\r\n\r\n"And yet they are lamentably true," said Henry. "What can we do?"\r\n\r\n"Surely there must be some sort of remedy."\r\n\r\n"There is but one that I can imagine, and that is one we all alike\r\nrevolt from. We might kill him."\r\n\r\n"That is out of the question."\r\n\r\n"Of course my impression is that he bears the same name really as\r\nmyself, and that he is my ancestor, from whom was painted the portrait\r\non the panel."\r\n\r\n"Have circumstances really so far pressed upon you," said Charles\r\nHolland, "as at length to convince you that this man is really the\r\nhorrible creature we surmise he may be?"\r\n\r\n"Dare we longer doubt it?" cried Henry, in a tone of excitement. "He is\r\nthe vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if I believe it," said Admiral Bell! "Stuff and\r\nnonsense! Vampyre, indeed! Bother the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Henry, "you have not had brought before you, painfully, as\r\nwe have, all the circumstances upon which we, in a manner, feel\r\ncompelled to found this horrible belief. At first incredulity was a\r\nnatural thing. We had no idea that ever we could be brought to believe\r\nin such a thing."\r\n\r\n"That is the case," added Marchdale. "But, step by step, we have been\r\ndriven from utter disbelief in this phenomenon to a trembling conviction\r\nthat it must be true."\r\n\r\n"Unless we admit that, simultaneously, the senses of a number of persons\r\nhave been deceived."\r\n\r\n"That is scarcely possible."\r\n\r\n"Then do you mean really to say there are such fish?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"We think so."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m d----d! I have heard all sorts of yarns about what fellows\r\nhave seen in one ocean and another; but this does beat them all to\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"It is monstrous," exclaimed Charles.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some few moments\' duration, and then Mr. Marchdale\r\nsaid, in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I ought not to propose any course of action until you, Henry,\r\nhave yourself done so; but even at the risk of being presumptuous, I\r\nwill say that I am firmly of opinion you ought to leave the Hall."\r\n\r\n"I am inclined to think so, too," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"But the creditors?" interposed Charles.\r\n\r\n"I think they might be consulted on the matter beforehand," added\r\nMarchdale, "when no doubt they would acquiesce in an arrangement which\r\ncould do them no harm."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, no harm," said Henry, "for I cannot take the estate with me,\r\nas they well know."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. If you do not like to sell it, you can let it."\r\n\r\n"To whom?"\r\n\r\n"Why, under the existing circumstances, it is not likely you would get\r\nany tenant for it than the one who has offered himself."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It seems to be a great object with him to live here, and it\r\nappears to me, that notwithstanding all that has occurred, it is most\r\ndecidedly the best policy to let him."\r\n\r\nNobody could really deny the reasonableness of this advice, although it\r\nseemed strange, and was repugnant to the feelings of them all, as they\r\nheard it. There was a pause of some seconds\' duration, and then Henry\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"It does, indeed, seem singular, to surrender one\'s house to such a\r\nbeing."\r\n\r\n"Especially," said Charles, "after what has occurred."\r\n\r\n"True."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Marchdale, "if any better plan of proceeding, taking\r\nthe whole case into consideration, can be devised, I shall be most\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"Will you consent to put off all proceedings for three days?" said\r\nCharles Holland, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Have you any plan, my dear sir?" said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"I have, but it is one which I would rather say nothing about for the\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"I have no objection," said Henry, "I do not know that three days can\r\nmake any difference in the state of affairs. Let it be so, if you wish,\r\nCharles."\r\n\r\n"Then I am satisfied," said Charles. "I cannot but feel that, situated\r\nas I am regarding Flora, this is almost more my affair than even yours,\r\nHenry."\r\n\r\n"I cannot see that," said Henry. "Why should you take upon yourself more\r\nof the responsibility of these affairs than I, Charles? You induce in my\r\nmind a suspicion that you have some desperate project in your\r\nimagination, which by such a proposition you would seek to reconcile me\r\nto."\r\n\r\nCharles was silent, and Henry then added,--\r\n\r\n"Now, Charles, I am quite convinced that what I have hinted at is the\r\nfact. You have conceived some scheme which you fancy would be much\r\nopposed by us?"\r\n\r\n"I will not deny that I have," said Charles. "It is one, however, which\r\nyou must allow me for the present to keep locked in my own breast."\r\n\r\n"Why will you not trust us?"\r\n\r\n"For two reasons."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"The one is, that I have not yet thoroughly determined upon the course I\r\nproject; and the other is, that it is one in which I am not justified in\r\ninvolving any one else."\r\n\r\n"Charles, Charles," said Henry, despondingly; "only consider for a\r\nmoment into what new misery you may plunge poor Flora, who is, Heaven\r\nknows, already sufficiently afflicted, by attempting an enterprise which\r\neven we, who are your friends, may unwittingly cross you in the\r\nperformance of."\r\n\r\n"This is one in which I fear no such result. It cannot so happen. Do not\r\nurge me."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you say at once what you think of doing?" said the old admiral.\r\n"What do you mean by turning your sails in all sorts of directions so\r\noddly? You sneak, why don\'t you be what do you call it--explicit?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot, uncle."\r\n\r\n"What, are you tongue-tied?"\r\n\r\n"All here know well," said Charles, "that if I do not unfold my mind\r\nfully, it is not that I fear to trust any one present, but from some\r\nother most special reason."\r\n\r\n"Charles, I forbear to urge you further," said Henry, "and only implore\r\nyou to be careful."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the room door opened, and George Bannerworth, accompanied\r\nby Mr. Chillingworth, came in.\r\n\r\n"Do not let me intrude," said the surgeon; "I fear, as I see you seated,\r\ngentlemen, that my presence must be a rudeness and a disturbance to some\r\nfamily consultation among yourselves?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry. "Pray be seated; we are\r\nvery glad indeed to see you. Admiral Bell, this is a friend on whom we\r\ncan rely--Mr. Chillingworth."\r\n\r\n"And one of the right sort, I can see," said the admiral, as he shook\r\nMr. Chillingworth by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Sir, you do me much honour," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"None at all, none at all; I suppose you know all about this infernal\r\nodd vampyre business?"\r\n\r\n"I believe I do, sir."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"I think time will develop the circumstances sufficiently to convince us\r\nall that such things cannot be."\r\n\r\n"D--n me, you are the most sensible fellow, then, that I have yet met\r\nwith since I have been in this neighbourhood; for everybody else is so\r\nconvinced about the vampyre, that they are ready to swear by him."\r\n\r\n"It would take much more to convince me. I was coming over here when I\r\nmet Mr. George Bannerworth coming to my house."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said George, "and Mr. Chillingworth has something to tell us of a\r\nnature confirmatory of our own suspicions."\r\n\r\n"It is strange," said Henry; "but any piece of news, come it from what\r\nquarter it may, seems to be confirmatory, in some degree or another, of\r\nthat dreadful belief in vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Why," said the doctor, "when Mr. George says that my news is of such a\r\ncharacter, I think he goes a little too far. What I have to tell you, I\r\ndo not conceive has anything whatever to do with the fact, or one fact\r\nof there being vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Let us hear it," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"It is simply this, that I was sent for by Sir Francis Varney myself."\r\n\r\n"You sent for?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he sent for me by a special messenger to come to him, and when I\r\nwent, which, under the circumstances, you may well guess, I did with all\r\nthe celerity possible, I found it was to consult me about a flesh wound\r\nin his arm, which was showing some angry symptoms."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was so. When I was introduced to him I found him lying on a\r\ncouch, and looking pale and unwell. In the most respectful manner, he\r\nasked me to be seated, and when I had taken a chair, he added,--\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. Chillingworth, I have sent for you in consequence of a slight\r\naccident which has happened to my arm. I was incautiously loading some\r\nfire-arms, and discharged a pistol so close to me that the bullet\r\ninflicted a wound on my arm.\'\r\n\r\n"\'If you will allow me," said I, \'to see the wound, I will give you my\r\nopinion.\'\r\n\r\n"He then showed me a jagged wound, which had evidently been caused by\r\nthe passage of a bullet, which, had it gone a little deeper, must have\r\ninflicted serious injury. As it was, the wound was but trifling.\r\n\r\n"He had evidently been attempting to dress it himself, but finding some\r\nconsiderable inflammation, he very likely got a little alarmed."\r\n\r\n"You dressed the wound?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of Sir Francis Varney, now that you have had so\r\ncapital an opportunity," said Henry, "of a close examination of him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, there is certainly something odd about him which I cannot well\r\ndefine, but, take him altogether, he can be a very gentlemanly man\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"So he can."\r\n\r\n"His manners are easy and polished; he has evidently mixed in good\r\nsociety, and I never, in all my life, heard such a sweet, soft, winning\r\nvoice."\r\n\r\n"That is strictly him. You noticed, I presume, his great likeness to the\r\nportrait on the panel?"\r\n\r\n"I did. At some moments, and viewing his face in some particular lights,\r\nit showed much more strongly than at others. My impression was that he\r\ncould, when he liked, look much more like the portrait on the panel than\r\nwhen he allowed his face to assume its ordinary appearance."\r\n\r\n"Probably such an impression would be produced upon your mind," said\r\nCharles, "by some accidental expression of the countenance which even he\r\nwas not aware of, and which often occurs in families."\r\n\r\n"It may be so."\r\n\r\n"Of course you did not hint, sir, at what has passed here with regard to\r\nhim?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I did not. Being, you see, called in professionally, I had no right to\r\ntake advantage of that circumstance to make any remarks to him about his\r\nprivate affairs."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"It was all one to me whether he was a vampyre or not, professionally,\r\nand however deeply I might feel, personally, interested in the matter, I\r\nsaid nothing to him about it, because, you see, if I had, he would have\r\nhad a fair opportunity of saying at once, \'Pray, sir, what is that to\r\nyou?\' and I should have been at a loss what to reply."\r\n\r\n"Can we doubt," said Henry, "but that this very wound has been inflicted\r\nupon Sir Francis Varney, by the pistol-bullet which was discharged at\r\nhim by Flora?"\r\n\r\n"Everything leads to such an assumption certainly," said Charles\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n"And yet you cannot even deduce from that the absolute fact of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney being a vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think, Mr. Chillingworth," said Marchdale, "anything would\r\nconvince you but a visit from him, and an actual attempt to fasten upon\r\nsome of your own veins."\r\n\r\n"That would not convince me," said Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Then you will not be convinced?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly will not. I mean to hold out to the last. I said at the\r\nfirst, and I say so still, that I never will give way to this most\r\noutrageous superstition."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could think with you," said Marchdale, with a shudder; "but\r\nthere may be something in the very atmosphere of this house which has\r\nbeen rendered hideous by the awful visits that have been made to it,\r\nwhich forbids me to disbelieve in those things which others more happily\r\nsituated can hold at arm\'s length, and utterly repudiate."\r\n\r\n"There may be," said Henry; "but as to that, I think, after the very\r\nstrongly expressed wish of Flora, I will decide upon leaving the house."\r\n\r\n"Will you sell it or let it?"\r\n\r\n"The latter I should much prefer," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"But who will take it now, except Sir Francis Varney? Why not at once\r\nlet him have it? I am well aware that this does sound odd advice, but\r\nremember, we are all the creatures of circumstances, and that, in some\r\ncases where we least like it, we must swim with the stream."\r\n\r\n"That you will not decide upon, however, at present," said Charles\r\nHolland, as he rose.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; a few days can make no difference."\r\n\r\n"None for the worse, certainly, and possibly much for the better."\r\n\r\n"Be it so; we will wait."\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said Charles, "will you spare me half an hour of your company?"\r\n\r\n"An hour, my boy, if you want it," said the admiral, rising from his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"Then this consultation is over," said Henry, "and we quite understand\r\nthat to leave the Hall is a matter determined on, and that in a few days\r\na decision shall be come to as to whether Varney the Vampyre shall be\r\nits tenant or not."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMIRAL\'S ADVICE TO CHARLES HOLLAND.--THE CHALLENGE TO THE VAMPYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Holland got his uncle into a room by themselves, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Uncle, you are a seaman, and accustomed to decide upon matters of\r\nhonour. I look upon myself as having been most grievously insulted by\r\nthis Sir Francis Varney. All accounts agree in representing him as a\r\ngentleman. He goes openly by a title, which, if it were not his, could\r\neasily be contradicted; therefore, on the score of position in life,\r\nthere is no fault to find with him. What would you do if you were\r\ninsulted by a gentleman?"\r\n\r\nThe old admiral\'s eyes sparkled, and he looked comically in the face of\r\nCharles, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"I know now where you are steering."\r\n\r\n"What would you do, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Fight him!"\r\n\r\n"I knew you would say so, and that\'s just what I want to do as regards\r\nSir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, I don\'t know that you can do better. He must be a\r\nthundering rascal, whether he is a vampyre or not; so if you feel that\r\nhe has insulted you, fight him by all means, Charles."\r\n\r\n"I am much pleased, uncle, to find that you take my view of the\r\nsubject," said Charles. "I knew that if I mentioned such a thing to the\r\nBannerworths, they would endeavour all in their power to pursuade me\r\nagainst it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, no doubt; because they are all impressed with a strange fear of\r\nthis fellow\'s vampyre powers. Besides, if a man is going to fight, the\r\nfewer people he mentions it to most decidedly the better, Charles."\r\n\r\n"I believe that is the fact, uncle. Should I overcome Varney, there will\r\nmost likely be at once an end to the numerous and uncomfortable\r\nperplexities of the Bannerworths as regards him; and if he overcome me,\r\nwhy, then, at all events, I shall have made an effort to rescue Flora\r\nfrom the dread of this man."\r\n\r\n"And then he shall fight me," added the admiral, "so he shall have two\r\nchances, at all events, Charles."\r\n\r\n"Nay, uncle, that would, you know, scarcely be fair. Besides, if I\r\nshould fall, I solemnly bequeath Flora Bannerworth to your good offices.\r\nI much fear that the pecuniary affairs of poor Henry,--from no fault of\r\nhis, Heaven knows,--are in a very bad state, and that Flora may yet live\r\nto want some kind and able friend."\r\n\r\n"Never fear, Charles. The young creature shall never want while the old\r\nadmiral has got a shot in the locker."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, uncle, thank you. I have ample cause to know, and to be able\r\nto rely upon your kind and generous nature. And now about the\r\nchallenge?"\r\n\r\n"You write it, boy, and I\'ll take it."\r\n\r\n"Will you second me, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I will. I wouldn\'t trust anybody else to do so on any\r\naccount. You leave all the arrangements with me, and I\'ll second you as\r\nyou ought to be seconded."\r\n\r\n"Then I will write it at once, for I have received injuries at the hands\r\nof that man, or devil, be he what he may, that I cannot put up with. His\r\nvisit to the chamber of her whom I love would alone constitute ample\r\nground of action."\r\n\r\n"I should say it rather would, my boy."\r\n\r\n"And after this corroborative story of the wound, I cannot for a moment\r\ndoubt that Sir Francis Varney is the vampyre, or the personifier of the\r\nvampyre."\r\n\r\n"That\'s clear enough, Charles. Come, just you write your challenge, my\r\nboy, at once, and let me have it."\r\n\r\n"I will, uncle."\r\n\r\nCharles was a little astonished, although pleased, at his uncle\'s ready\r\nacquiescence in his fighting a vampyre, but that circumstance he\r\nascribed to the old man\'s habits of life, which made him so familiar\r\nwith strife and personal contentions of all sorts, that he did not\r\nascribe to it that amount of importance which more peaceable people did.\r\nHad he, while he was writing the note to Sir Francis Varney, seen the\r\nold admiral\'s face, and the exceedingly cunning look it wore, he might\r\nhave suspected that the acquiescence in the duel was but a seeming\r\nacquiescence. This, however, escaped him, and in a few moments he read\r\nto his uncle the following note:--\r\n\r\n     "To SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.\r\n\r\n     "Sir,--The expressions made use of towards me by you, as well as\r\n     general circumstances, which I need not further allude to here,\r\n     induce me to demand of you that satisfaction due from one\r\n     gentleman to another. My uncle, Admiral Bell, is the bearer of\r\n     this note, and will arrange preliminaries with any friend you may\r\n     choose to appoint to act in your behalf. I am, sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n     "CHARLES HOLLAND."\r\n\r\n"Will that do?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Capital!" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you like it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could not help liking it. The least said and the most to the\r\npurpose, always pleases me best; and this explains nothing, and demands\r\nall you want--which is a fight; so it\'s all right, you see, and nothing\r\ncan be possibly better."\r\n\r\nCharles did glance in his uncle\'s face, for he suspected, from the\r\nmanner in which these words were uttered, that the old man was amusing\r\nhimself a little at his expense. The admiral, however, looked so\r\nsupernaturally serious that Charles was foiled.\r\n\r\n"I repeat, it\'s a capital letter," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you said so."\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you staring at?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Do you doubt my word?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, uncle; only I thought there was a degree of irony in the\r\nmanner in which you spoke."\r\n\r\n"None at all, my boy. I never was more serious in all my life."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Then you will remember that I leave my honour in this affair\r\ncompletely in your hands."\r\n\r\n"Depend upon me, my boy."\r\n\r\n"I will, and do."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be off and see the fellow at once."\r\n\r\nThe admiral bustled out of the room, and in a few moments Charles heard\r\nhim calling loudly,--\r\n\r\n"Jack--Jack Pringle, you lubber, where are you?--Jack Pringle, I say."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, emerging from the kitchen, where he had been\r\nmaking himself generally useful in assisting Mrs. Bannerworth, there\r\nbeing no servant in the house, to cook some dinner for the family.\r\n\r\n"Come on, you rascal, we are going for a walk."\r\n\r\n"The rations will be served out soon," growled Jack.\r\n\r\n"We shall be back in time, you cormorant, never fear. You are always\r\nthinking of eating and drinking, you are, Jack; and I\'ll be hanged if I\r\nthink you ever think of anything else. Come on, will you; I\'m going on\r\nrather a particular cruise just now, so mind what you are about."\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye, sir," said the tar, and these two originals, who so perfectly\r\nunderstood each other, walked away, conversing as they went, and their\r\ndifferent voices coming upon the ear of Charles, until distance\r\nobliterated all impression of the sound.\r\n\r\nCharles paced to and fro in the room where he had held this brief and\r\nconclusive conversation with his uncle. He was thoughtful, as any one\r\nmight well be who knew not but that the next four-and-twenty hours would\r\nbe the limit of his sojourn in this world.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Flora--Flora!" he at length said, "how happy we might to have been\r\ntogether--how happy we might have been! but all is past now, and there\r\nseems nothing left us but to endure. There it but one chance, and that\r\nis in my killing this fearful man who is invested with so dreadful an\r\nexistence. And if I do kill him in fair and in open fight, I will take\r\ncare that his mortal frame has no power again to revisit the glimpses of\r\nthe moon."\r\n\r\nIt was strange to imagine that such was the force of many concurrent\r\ncircumstances, that a young man like Charles Holland, of first-rate\r\nabilities and education, should find it necessary to give in so far to a\r\nbelief which was repugnant to all his best feelings and habits of\r\nthought, as to be reasoning with himself upon the best means of\r\npreventing the resuscitation of the corpse of a vampyre. But so it was.\r\nHis imagination had yielded to a succession of events which very few\r\npersons indeed could have held out against.\r\n\r\n"I have heard and read," he said, as he continued his agitated and\r\nuneasy walk, "of how these dreadful beings are to be in their graves. I\r\nhave heard of stakes being driven through the body so as to pin it to\r\nthe earth until the gradual progress of decay has rendered its\r\nrevivification a thing of utter and total impossibility. Then, again,"\r\nhe added, after a slight pause, "I have heard of their being burned, and\r\nthe ashes gathered to the winds of Heaven to prevent them from ever\r\nagain uniting or assuming human form."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese were disagreeable and strange fancies, and he shuddered while he\r\nindulged in them. He felt a kind of trembling horror come over him even\r\nat the thought of engaging in conflict with a being, who perhaps, had\r\nlived more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\n"That portrait," he thought, "on the panel, is the portrait of a man in\r\nthe prime of life. If it be the portrait of Sir Francis Varney, by the\r\ndate which the family ascribe to it he must be nearly one hundred and\r\nfifty years of age now."\r\n\r\nThis was a supposition which carried the imagination to a vast amount of\r\nstrange conjectures.\r\n\r\n"What changes he must have witnessed about him in that time," thought\r\nCharles. "How he must have seen kingdoms totter and fall, and how many\r\nchanges of habits, of manners, and of customs must he have become a\r\nspectator of. Renewing too, ever and anon, his fearful existence by such\r\nfearful means."\r\n\r\nThis was a wide field of conjecture for a fertile imagination, and now\r\nthat he was on the eve of engaging with such a being in mortal combat,\r\non behalf of her he loved, the thoughts it gave rise to came more\r\nstrongly and thickly upon him than ever they had done before.\r\n\r\n"But I will fight him," he suddenly said, "for Flora\'s sake, were he a\r\nhundred times more hideous a being than so many evidences tend to prove\r\nhim. I will fight with him, and it may be my fate to rid the world of\r\nsuch a monster in human form."\r\n\r\nCharles worked himself up to a kind of enthusiasm by which he almost\r\nsucceeded in convincing himself that, in attempting the destruction of\r\nSir Francis Varney, he was the champion of human nature.\r\n\r\nIt would be aside from the object of these pages, which is to record\r\nfacts as they occurred, to enter into the metaphysical course of\r\nreasoning which came across Charles\'s mind; suffice it to say that he\r\nfelt nothing shaken as regarded his resolve to meet Varney the Vampyre,\r\nand that he made up his mind the conflict should be one of life or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n"It must be so," he said. "It must be so. Either he or I must fall in\r\nthe fight which shall surely be."\r\n\r\nHe now sought Flora, for how soon might he now be torn from her for ever\r\nby the irresistible hand of death. He felt that, during the few brief\r\nhours which now would only elapse previous to his meeting with Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, he could not enjoy too much of the society of her who\r\nreigned supreme in his heart, and held in her own keeping his best\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nBut while Charles is thus employed, let us follow his uncle and Jack\r\nPringle to the residence of Varney, which, as the reader is aware, was\r\nso near at hand that it required not many minutes\' sharp walking to\r\nreach it.\r\n\r\nThe admiral knew well he could trust Jack with any secret, for long\r\nhabits of discipline and deference to the orders of superiors takes off\r\nthe propensity to blabbing which, among civilians who are not accustomed\r\nto discipline, is so very prevalent. The old man therefore explained to\r\nJack what he meant to do, and it received Jack\'s full approval; but as\r\nin the enforced detail of other matters it must come out, we will not\r\nhere prematurely enter into the admiral\'s plans.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the residence of Sir Francis Varney, they were\r\nreceived courteously enough, and the admiral desired Jack to wait for\r\nhim in the handsome hall of the house, while he was shewn up stairs to\r\nthe private room of the vampyre.\r\n\r\n"Confound the fellow!" muttered the old admiral, "he is well lodged at\r\nall events. I should say he was not one of those sort of vampyres who\r\nhave nowhere to go to but their own coffins when the evening comes."\r\n\r\nThe room into which the admiral was shewn had green blinds to it, and\r\nthey were all drawn down. It is true that the sun was shining brightly\r\noutside, although transiently, but still a strange green tinge was\r\nthrown over everything in the room, and more particularly did it appear\r\nto fall upon the face of Varney, converting his usually sallow\r\ncountenance into a still more hideous and strange colour. He was sitting\r\nupon a couch, and, when the admiral came in, he rose, and said, in a\r\ndeep-toned voice, extremely different to that he usually spoke in,--\r\n\r\n"My humble home is much honoured, sir, by your presence in it."\r\n\r\n"Good morning," said the admiral. "I have come to speak to you, sir,\r\nrather seriously."\r\n\r\n"However abrupt this announcement may sound to me," said Varney, "I am\r\nquite sure I shall always hear, with the most profound respect, whatever\r\nAdmiral Bell may have to say."\r\n\r\n"There is no respect required," said the admiral, "but only a little\r\nattention."\r\n\r\nSir Francis bowed in a stately manner, saying,--\r\n\r\n"I shall be quite unhappy if you will not be seated, Admiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind that, Sir Francis Varney, if you be Sir Francis Varney;\r\nfor you may be the devil himself, for all I know. My nephew, Charles\r\nHolland, considers that, one way and another, he has a very tolerable\r\nquarrel with you."\r\n\r\n"I much grieve to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Believe me, I do. I am most scrupulous in what I say; and an assertion\r\nthat I am grieved, you may thoroughly and entirely depend upon."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, never mind that; Charles Holland is a young man just\r\nentering into life. He loves a girl who is, I think, every way worthy of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a felicitous prospect!"\r\n\r\n"Just hear me out, if you please."\r\n\r\n"With pleasure, sir--with pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, when a young, hot-headed fellow thinks he has a good ground\r\nof quarrel with anybody, you will not be surprised at his wanting to\r\nfight it out."\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, to come to the point, my nephew, Charles Holland, has a\r\nfancy for fighting with you."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\n"You take it d----d easy."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, why should I be uneasy? He is not my nephew, you know. I\r\nshall have no particular cause, beyond those feelings of common\r\ncompassion which I hope inhabit my breast as well as every one else\'s."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he is a young man just, as you say, entering into life, and I\r\ncannot help thinking it would be a pity to cut him off like a flower in\r\nthe bud, so very soon."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you make quite sure, then, of settling him, do you?"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, only consider; he might be very troublesome, indeed; you\r\nknow young men are hot-headed and troublesome. Even if I were only to\r\nmaim him, he might be a continual and never-ceasing annoyance to me. I\r\nthink I should be absolutely, in a manner of speaking, compelled to cut\r\nhim off."\r\n\r\n"The devil you do!"\r\n\r\n"As you say, sir."\r\n\r\n"D--n your assurance, Mr. Vampyre, or whatever odd fish you may be."\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell, I never called upon you and received a courteous\r\nreception, and then insulted you."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you talk of cutting off a better man than yourself? D--n\r\nit, what would you say to him cutting you off?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for me, my good sir, that\'s quite another thing. Cutting me off\r\nis very doubtful."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney gave a strange smile as he spoke, and shook his head,\r\nas if some most extraordinary and extravagant proposition had been\r\nmooted, which it was scarcely worth the while of anybody possessed of\r\ncommon sense to set about expecting.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell felt strongly inclined to get into a rage, but he repressed\r\nthe idea as much as he could, although, but for the curious faint green\r\nlight that came through the blinds, his heightened colour would have\r\nsufficiently proclaimed what state of mind he was in.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Varney," he said, "all this is quite beside the question; but, at\r\nall events, if it have any weight at all, it ought to have a\r\nconsiderable influence in deciding you to accept of what terms I\r\npropose."\r\n\r\n"What are they, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that you permit me to espouse my nephew Charles\'s quarrel, and\r\nmeet you instead of him."\r\n\r\n"You meet me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ve met a better man more than once before. It can make no\r\ndifference to you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that, Admiral Bell. One generally likes, in a duel, to\r\nface him with whom one has had the misunderstanding, be it on what\r\ngrounds it may."\r\n\r\n"There\'s some reason, I know, in what you say; but, surely, if I am\r\nwilling, you need not object."\r\n\r\n"And is your nephew willing thus to shift the danger and the job of\r\nresenting his own quarrels on to your shoulders?"\r\n\r\n"No; he knows nothing about it. He has written you a challenge, of which\r\nI am the bearer, but I voluntarily, and of my own accord, wish to meet\r\nyou instead."\r\n\r\n"This is a strange mode of proceeding."\r\n\r\n"If you will not accede to it, and fight him first, and any harm comes\r\nto him, you shall fight me afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed you shall, however surprised you may look."\r\n\r\n"As this appears to be quite a family affair, then," said Sir Francis\r\nVarney, "it certainly does appear immaterial which of you I fight with\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Quite so; now you take a sensible view of the question. Will you meet\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I have no particular objection. Have you settled all your affairs, and\r\nmade your will?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I only asked, because there is generally so much food for\r\nlitigation if a man dies intestate, and is worth any money."\r\n\r\n"You make devilish sure," said the admiral, "of being the victor. Have\r\nyou made your will?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my will," smiled Sir Francis; "that, my good sir, is quite an\r\nindifferent affair."\r\n\r\n"Well, make it or not, as you like. I am old, I know, but I can pull a\r\ntrigger as well as any one."\r\n\r\n"Do what?"\r\n\r\n"Pull a trigger."\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t suppose I resort to any such barbarous modes of\r\nfighting?"\r\n\r\n"Barbarous! Why, how do you fight then?"\r\n\r\n"As a gentleman, with my sword."\r\n\r\n"Swords! Oh, nonsense! nobody fights with swords now-a-days. That\'s all\r\nexploded."\r\n\r\n"I cling to the customs and the fashions of my youth," said Varney. "I\r\nhave been, years ago, accustomed always to wear a sword, and to be\r\nwithout one now vexes me."\r\n\r\n"Pray, how many years ago?"\r\n\r\n"I am older than I look, but that is not the question. I am willing to\r\nmeet you with swords if you like. You are no doubt aware that, as the\r\nchallenged party, I am entitled to the choice of weapons."\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"Then you cannot object to my availing myself of the one in the use of\r\nwhich I am perfectly unequalled."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am, I think, the first swordsman in Europe; I have had immense\r\npractice."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, you have certainly made a most unexpected choice of weapons.\r\nI can use a sword still, but am by no means a master of fencing.\r\nHowever, it shall not be said that I went back from my word, and let the\r\nchances be as desperate as they may, I will meet you."\r\n\r\n"Very good."\r\n\r\n"With swords?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, with swords; but I must have everything properly arranged, so that\r\nno blame can rest on me, you know. As you will be killed, you are safe\r\nfrom all consequences, but I shall be in a very different position; so,\r\nif you please, I must have this meeting got up in such a manner as shall\r\nenable me to prove, to whoever may question me on the subject, that you\r\nhad fair play."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never fear that."\r\n\r\n"But I do fear it. The world, my good sir, is censorious, and you cannot\r\nstop people from saying extremely ill-natured things."\r\n\r\n"What do you require, then?"\r\n\r\n"I require you to send me a friend with a formal challenge."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Then I shall refer him to a friend of mine, and they two must settle\r\neverything between them."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. I will have a surgeon on the ground, in case, when I pink\r\nyou, there should be a chance of saving your life. It always looks\r\nhumane."\r\n\r\n"When you pink me?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you take these affairs easy. I suppose you have had a few\r\nof them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a good number. People like yourself worry me into them, I don\'t\r\nlike the trouble, I assure you; it is no amusement to me. I would\r\nrather, by a great deal, make some concession than fight, because I will\r\nfight with swords, and the result is then so certain that there is no\r\ndanger in the matter to me."\r\n\r\n"Hark you, Sir Francis Varney. You are either a very clever actor, or a\r\nman, as you say, of such skill with your sword, that you can make sure\r\nof the result of a duel. You know, therefore, that it is not fair play\r\non your part to fight a duel with that weapon."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon there. I never challenge anybody, and when\r\nfoolish people will call me out, contrary to my inclination, I think I\r\nam bound to take what care of myself I can."\r\n\r\n"D--n me, there\'s some reason in that, too," said the admiral; "but why\r\ndo you insult people?"\r\n\r\n"People insult me first."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"How should you like to be called a vampyre, and stared at as if you\r\nwere some hideous natural phenomenon?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but--"\r\n\r\n"I say, Admiral Bell, how should you like it? I am a harmless country\r\ngentleman, and because, in the heated imaginations of some member of a\r\ncrack-brained family, some housebreaker has been converted into a\r\nvampyre, I am to be pitched upon as the man, and insulted and persecuted\r\naccordingly."\r\n\r\n"But you forget the proofs."\r\n\r\n"What proofs?"\r\n\r\n"The portrait, for one."\r\n\r\n"What! Because there is an accidental likeness between me and an old\r\npicture, am I to be set down as a vampyre? Why, when I was in Austria\r\nlast, I saw an old portrait of a celebrated court fool, and you so\r\nstrongly resemble it, that I was quite struck when I first saw you with\r\nthe likeness; but I was not so unpolite as to tell you that I considered\r\nyou were the court fool turned vampyre."\r\n\r\n"D--n your assurance!"\r\n\r\n"And d--n yours, if you come to that."\r\n\r\nThe admiral was fairly beaten. Sir Francis Varney was by far too\r\nlong-headed and witty for him. After now in vain endeavouring to find\r\nsomething to say, the old man buttoned up his coat in a great passion,\r\nand looking fiercely at Varney, he said,--"I don\'t pretend to a gift of\r\nthe gab. D--n me, it ain\'t one of my peculiarities; but though you may\r\ntalk me down, you sha\'n\'t keep me down."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is not very good. You shall hear from me."\r\n\r\n"I am willing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care whether you are willing or not. You shall find that when\r\nonce I begin to tackle an enemy, I don\'t so easily leave him. One or\r\nboth of us, sir, is sure to sink."\r\n\r\n"Agreed."\r\n\r\n"So say I. You shall find that I\'m a tar for all weathers, and if you\r\nwere a hundred and fifty vampires all rolled into one, I\'d tackle you\r\nsomehow."\r\n\r\nThe admiral walked to the door in high dudgeon; when he was near to it,\r\nVarney said, in some of his most winning and gentle accents,--\r\n\r\n"Will you not take some refreshment, sir before you go from my humble\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\n"No!" roared the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Something cooling?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir. A hospitable host can do no more than offer to\r\nentertain his guests."\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell turned at the door, and said, with some degree of intense\r\nbitterness,\r\n\r\n"You look rather poorly. I suppose, to-night, you will go and suck\r\nsomebody\'s blood, you shark--you confounded vampyre! You ought to be\r\nmade to swallow a red-hot brick, and then let dance about till it\r\ndigests."\r\n\r\nVarney smiled as he rang the bell, and said to a servant,--\r\n\r\n"Show my very excellent friend Admiral Bell out. He will not take any\r\nrefreshments."\r\n\r\nThe servant bowed, and preceded the admiral down the staircase; but, to\r\nhis great surprise, instead of a compliment in the shape of a shilling\r\nor half-a-crown for his pains, he received a tremendous kick behind,\r\nwith a request to go and take it to his master, with his compliments.\r\n\r\nThe fume that the old admiral was in beggars all description. He walked\r\nto Bannerworth Hall at such a rapid pace, that Jack Pringle had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in the world to keep up with him, so as to be at all\r\nwithin speaking distance.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa, Jack," cried the old man, when they were close to the Hall.\r\n"Did you see me kick that fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s some consolation, at any rate, if somebody saw it. It\r\nought to have been his master, that\'s all I can say to it, and I wish it\r\nhad."\r\n\r\n"How have you settled it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Settled what?"\r\n\r\n"The fight, sir."\r\n\r\n"D--n me, Jack, I haven\'t settled it at all."\r\n\r\n"That\'s bad, sir."\r\n\r\n"I know it is; but it shall be settled for all that, I can tell him, let\r\nhim vapour as much as he may about pinking me, and one thing and\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"Pinking you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He wants to fight with cutlasses, or toasting-forks, d--n me, I\r\ndon\'t know exactly which, and then he must have a surgeon on the ground,\r\nfor fear when he pinks me I shouldn\'t slip my cable in a regular way,\r\nand he should be blamed."\r\n\r\nJack gave a long whistle, as he replied,--\r\n\r\n"Going to do it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know now what I\'m going to do. Mind, Jack, mum is the word."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll turn the matter over in my mind, and then decide upon what had\r\nbest be done. If he pinks me, I\'ll take d----d good care he don\'t pink\r\nCharles."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, don\'t let him do that. A _wamphigher_, sir, ain\'t no good\r\nopponent to anybody. I never seed one afore, but it strikes me as the\r\nbest way to settle him, would be to shut him up in some little bit of a\r\ncabin, and then smoke him with brimstone, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I\'ll consider, Jack, I\'ll consider. Something must be done,\r\nand that quickly too. Zounds, here\'s Charles--what the deuce shall I say\r\nto him, by way of an excuse, I wonder, for not arranging his affair with\r\nVarney? Hang me, if I ain\'t taken aback now, and don\'t know where to\r\nplace a hand."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER TO CHARLES.--THE QUARREL.--THE ADMIRAL\'S NARRATIVE.--THE\r\nMIDNIGHT MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was Charles Holland who now advanced hurriedly to meet the admiral.\r\nThe young man\'s manner was anxious. He was evidently most intent upon\r\nknowing what answer could be sent by Sir Francis Varney to his\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n"Uncle," he said, "tell me at once, will he meet me? You can talk of\r\nparticulars afterwards, but now tell me at once if he will meet me?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that," said the admiral, with a great deal of fidgetty\r\nhesitation, "you see, I can\'t exactly say."\r\n\r\n"Not say!"\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s a very odd fish. Don\'t you think he\'s a very odd fish, Jack\r\nPringle\'?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"There, you hear, Charles, that Jack is of my opinion that your opponent\r\nis an odd fish."\r\n\r\n"But, uncle, why trifle with my impatience thus? Have you seen Sir\r\nFrancis Varney?"\r\n\r\n"Seen him. Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, to tell the truth, my lad, I advise you not to fight with him at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Uncle, is this like you? This advice from you, to compromise my honour,\r\nafter sending a man a challenge?"\r\n\r\n"D--n it all, Jack, I don\'t know how to get out of it," said the\r\nadmiral. "I tell you what it is, Charles, he wants to fight with swords;\r\nand what on earth is the use of your engaging with a fellow who has been\r\npractising at his weapon for more than a hundred years?"\r\n\r\n"Well, uncle, if any one had told me that you would be terrified by this\r\nSir Francis Varney into advising me not to fight, I should have had no\r\nhesitation whatever in saying such a thing was impossible."\r\n\r\n"I terrified?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you advise me not to meet this man, even after I have challenged\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Jack," said the admiral, "I can\'t carry it on, you see. I never could\r\ngo on with anything that was not as plain as an anchor, and quite\r\nstraightforward. I must just tell all that has occurred."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir. The best way."\r\n\r\n"You think so, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"I know it is, sir, always axing pardon for having a opinion at all,\r\nexcepting when it happens to be the same as yourn, sir."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you libellous villain! Now, listen to me, Charles. I\r\ngot up a scheme of my own."\r\n\r\nCharles gave a groan, for he had a very tolerable appreciation of his\r\nuncle\'s amount of skill in getting up a scheme of any kind or\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n"Now here am I," continued the admiral, "an old hulk, and not fit for\r\nuse anymore. What\'s the use of me, I should like to know? Well, that\'s\r\nsettled. But you are young and hearty, and have a long life before you.\r\nWhy should you throw away your life upon a lubberly vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I begin to perceive now, uncle," said Charles, reproachfully, "why you,\r\nwith such apparent readiness, agreed to this duel taking place."\r\n\r\n"Well, I intended to fight the fellow myself, that\'s the long and short\r\nof it, boy."\r\n\r\n"How could you treat me so?"\r\n\r\n"No nonsense, Charles. I tell you it was all in the family. I intended\r\nto fight him myself. What was the odds whether I slipped my cable with\r\nhis assistance, or in the regular course a little after this? That\'s the\r\nway to argufy the subject; so, as I tell you, I made up my mind to fight\r\nhim myself."\r\n\r\nCharles looked despairingly, but said,--\r\n\r\n"What was the result?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the result! D--n me, I suppose that\'s to come. The vagabond won\'t\r\nfight like a Christian. He says he\'s quite willing to fight anybody that\r\ncalls him out, provided it\'s all regular."\r\n\r\n"Well--well."\r\n\r\n"And he, being the party challenged--for he says he never himself\r\nchallenges anybody, as he is quite tired of it--must have his choice of\r\nweapons."\r\n\r\n"He is entitled to that; but it is generally understood now-a-days that\r\npistols are the weapons in use among gentlemen for such purposes."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but he won\'t understand any such thing, I tell you. He will fight\r\nwith swords."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he is, then, an adept at the use of the sword?"\r\n\r\n"He says he is."\r\n\r\n"No doubt--no doubt. I cannot blame a man for choosing, when he has the\r\nliberty of choice, that weapon in the use of which he most particularly,\r\nfrom practice, excels."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but if he be one half the swordsman he has had time enough,\r\naccording to all accounts, to be, what sort of chance have you with\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Do I hear you reasoning thus?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure you do. I have turned wonderfully prudent, you see: so\r\nI mean to fight him myself, and mind, now, you have nothing whatever to\r\ndo with it."\r\n\r\n"An effort of prudence that, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Well, didn\'t I say so?"\r\n\r\n"Come--come, uncle, this won\'t do. I have challenged Sir Francis Varney,\r\nand I must meet him with any weapon he may, as the challenged party,\r\nchoose to select. Besides, you are not, I dare say, aware that I am a\r\nvery good fencer, and probably stand as fair a chance as Varney in a\r\ncontest with swords."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle. I could not be so long on the continent as I have been\r\nwithout picking up a good knowledge of the sword, which is so popular\r\nall over Germany."\r\n\r\n"Humph! but only consider, this d----d fellow is no less than a hundred\r\nand fifty years old."\r\n\r\n"I care not."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I do."\r\n\r\n"Uncle, uncle, I tell you I will fight with him; and if you do not\r\narrange matters for me so that I can have the meeting with this man,\r\nwhich I have myself sought, and cannot, even if I wished, now recede\r\nfrom with honour, I must seek some other less scrupulous friend to do\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Give me an hour or two to think of it, Charles," said the admiral.\r\n"Don\'t speak to any one else, but give me a little time. You shall have\r\nno cause of complaint. Your honour cannot suffer in my hands."\r\n\r\n"I will wait your leisure, uncle; but remember that such affairs as\r\nthese, when once broached, had always better be concluded with all\r\nconvenient dispatch."\r\n\r\n"I know that, boy--I know that."\r\n\r\nThe admiral walked away, and Charles, who really felt much fretted at\r\nthe delay which had taken place, returned to the house.\r\n\r\nHe had not been there long, when a lad, who had been temporarily hired\r\nduring the morning by Henry to answer the gate, brought him a note,\r\nsaying,--\r\n\r\n"A servant, sir, left this for you just now."\r\n\r\n"For me?" said Charles, as he glanced at the direction. "This is\r\nstrange, for I have no acquaintance about here. Does any one wait?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\nThe note was properly directed to him, therefore Charles Holland at once\r\nopened it. A glance at the bottom of the page told him that it came from\r\nhis enemy, Sir Francis Varney, and then he read it with much eagerness.\r\nIt ran thus:--\r\n\r\n     "SIR,--Your uncle, as he stated himself to be, Admiral Bell, was\r\n     the bearer to me, as I understood him this day, of a challenge\r\n     from you. Owing to some unaccountable hallucination of intellect,\r\n     he seemed to imagine that I intended to set myself up as a sort\r\n     of animated target, for any one to shoot at who might have a\r\n     fancy so to do.\r\n\r\n     "According to this eccentric view of the case, the admiral had\r\n     the kindness to offer to fight me first, when, should he not have\r\n     the good fortune to put me out of the world, you were to try your\r\n     skill, doubtless.\r\n\r\n     "I need scarcely say that I object to these family arrangements.\r\n     You have challenged me, and, fancying the offence sufficient, you\r\n     defy me to mortal combat. If, therefore, I fight with any one at\r\n     all, it must be with you.\r\n\r\n     "You will clearly understand me, sir, that I do not accuse you of\r\n     being at all party to this freak of intellect of your uncle\'s.\r\n     He, no doubt, alone conceived it, with a laudable desire on his\r\n     part of serving you. If, however, to meet me, do so to-night, in\r\n     the middle of the park surrounding your own friends estate.\r\n\r\n     "There is a pollard oak growing close to a small pool; you, no\r\n     doubt, have noticed the spot often. Meet me there, if you please,\r\n     and any satisfaction you like I will give you, at twelve o\'clock\r\n     this night.\r\n\r\n     "Come alone, or you will not see me. It shall be at your own\r\n     option entirely, to convert the meeting into a hostile one or\r\n     not. You need send me no answer to this. If you are at the place\r\n     I mention at the time I have named, well and good. If you an not,\r\n     I can only, if I please, imagine that you shrink from a meeting\r\n     with\r\n\r\n     "FRANCIS VARNEY."\r\n\r\nCharles Holland read this letter twice over carefully, and then folding\r\nit up, and placing it in his pocket, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will meet him; he may be assured that I will meet him. He shall\r\nfind that I do not shrink from Francis Varney In the name of honour,\r\nlove, virtue, and Heaven, I will meet this man, and it shall go hard\r\nwith me but I will this night wring from him the secret of what he\r\nreally is. For the sake of her who is so dear to me--for her sake, I\r\nwill meet this man, or monster, be he what he may."\r\n\r\nIt would have been far more prudent had Charles informed Henry\r\nBannerworth or George of his determination to meet the vampyre that\r\nevening, but he did not do so. Somehow he fancied it would be some\r\nreproach against his courage if he did not go, and go alone, too, for he\r\ncould not help suspecting that, from the conduct of his uncle, Sir\r\nFrancis Varney might have got up an opinion inimical to his courage.\r\n\r\nWith all the eager excitement of youth, there was nothing that arrayed\r\nitself to his mind in such melancholy and uncomfortable colours as an\r\nimputation upon his courage.\r\n\r\n"I will show this vampyre, if he be such," he said, "that I am not\r\nafraid to meet him, and alone, too, at his own hour--at midnight, even\r\nwhen, if his preternatural powers be of more avail to him than at any\r\nother time, he can attempt, if he dare, to use them."\r\n\r\nCharles resolved upon going armed, and with the greatest care he loaded\r\nhis pistols, and placed them aside ready for action, when the time\r\nshould come to set out to meet the vampyre at the spot in the park which\r\nhad been particularly alluded to in his letter.\r\n\r\nThis spot was perfectly well known to Charles; indeed, no one could be a\r\nsingle day at Bannerworth Hall without noticing it, so prominent an\r\nobject was that pollard oak, standing, as it did, alone, with the\r\nbeautiful green sward all around it. Near to it was the pool which hid\r\nbeen mentioned, which was, in reality, a fish-pond, and some little\r\ndistance off commenced the thick plantation, among the intricacies of\r\nwhich Sir Francis Varney, or the vampyre, had been supposed to\r\ndisappear, after the revivification of his body at the full of the moon.\r\n\r\nThis spot was in view of several of the windows of the house, so that if\r\nthe night should happen to be a very light one, and any of the\r\ninhabitants of the Hall should happen to have the curiosity to look from\r\nthose particular windows, no doubt the meeting between Charles Holland\r\nand the vampyre would be seen.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was a contingency which was nothing to Charles, whatever\r\nit might be to Sir Francis Varney, and he scarcely at all considered it\r\nas worth consideration. He felt more happy and comfortable now that\r\neverything seemed to be definitively arranged by which he could come to\r\nsome sort of explanation with that mysterious being who had so\r\neffectually, as yet, succeeded in destroying his peace of mind and his\r\nprospects of happiness.\r\n\r\n"I will this night force him to declare himself," thought Charles. "He\r\nshall tell me who and what he really is, and by some means I will\r\nendeavour to put an end to those frightful persecutions which Flora has\r\nsuffered."\r\n\r\nThis was a thought which considerably raised Charles\'s spirits, and when\r\nhe sought Flora again, which he now did, she was surprised to see him so\r\nmuch more easy and composed in his mind, which was sufficiently shown by\r\nhis manner, than he had been but so short a time before.\r\n\r\n"Charles," she said, "what has happened to give such an impetus to your\r\nspirits?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, dear Flora, nothing; but I have been endeavouring to throw\r\nfrom my mind all gloomy thoughts, and to convince myself that in the\r\nfuture you and I, dearest, may yet be very happy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Charles, if I could but think so."\r\n\r\n"Endeavour, Flora, to think so. Remember how much our happiness is\r\nalways in our own power, Flora, and that, let fate do her worst, so long\r\nas we are true to each other, we have a recompense for every ill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed, Charles, that is a dear recompense."\r\n\r\n"And it is well that no force of circumstances short of death itself can\r\ndivide us."\r\n\r\n"True, Charles, true, and I am more than ever now bound to look upon you\r\nwith a loving heart; for have you not clung to me generously under\r\ncircumstances which, if any at all could have justified you in rending\r\nasunder every tie which bound us together, surely would have done so\r\nmost fully."\r\n\r\n"It is misfortune and distress that tries love," said Charles. "It is\r\nthus that the touchstone is applied to see if it be current gold indeed,\r\nor some base metal, which by a superficial glitter imitates it."\r\n\r\n"And your love is indeed true gold."\r\n\r\n"I am unworthy of one glance from those dear eyes if it were not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if we could but go from here I think then we might be happy. A\r\nstrong impression is upon my mind, and has been so for some time, that\r\nthese persecutions to which I have been subjected are peculiar to this\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Think you so?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"It may be so, Flora. You are aware that your brother has made up his\r\nmind that he will leave the Hall."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"And that only in deference to an expressed wish of mine he put off the\r\ncarrying such a resolve into effect for a few days."\r\n\r\n"He said so much."\r\n\r\n"Do not, however, imagine, dearest Flora, that those few days will be\r\nidly spent."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Charles, I could not imagine so."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, I have some hopes that in that short space of time I shall\r\nbe able to accomplish yet something which shall have a material effect\r\nupon the present posture of affairs."\r\n\r\n"Do not run into danger, Charles."\r\n\r\n"I will not. Believe me, Flora, I have too much appreciation of the\r\nvalue of an existence which is blessed by your love, to encounter any\r\nneedless risks."\r\n\r\n"You say needless. Why do you not confide in me, and tell me if the\r\nobject you have in view to accomplish in the few days delay is a\r\ndangerous one at all."\r\n\r\n"Will you forgive me, Flora, if for once I keep a secret from you?"\r\n\r\n"Then, Charles, along with the forgiveness I must conjure up a host of\r\napprehensions."\r\n\r\n"Nay, why so?"\r\n\r\n"You would tell me if there were no circumstances that you feared would\r\nfill me with alarm."\r\n\r\n"Now, Flora, your fears and not your judgment condemn me. Surely you\r\ncannot think me so utterly heedless as to court danger for danger\'s\r\nsake."\r\n\r\n"No, not so--"\r\n\r\n"You pause."\r\n\r\n"And yet you have a sense of what you call honour, which, I fear, would\r\nlead you into much risk."\r\n\r\n"I have a sense of honour; but not that foolish one which hangs far more\r\nupon the opinions of others than my own. If I thought a course of honour\r\nlay before me, and all the world, in a mistaken judgment, were to\r\ncondemn it as wrong, I would follow it."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Charles; you are right. Let me pray of you to be\r\ncareful, and, at all events, to interpose no more delay to our leaving\r\nthis house than you shall feel convinced is absolutely necessary for\r\nsome object of real and permanent importance."\r\n\r\nCharles promised Flora Bannerworth that for her sake, as well as his\r\nown, he would be most specially careful of his safety; and then in such\r\nendearing conversation as may be well supposed to be dictated by such\r\nhearts as theirs another happy hour was passed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey pictured to themselves the scene where first they met, and with a\r\nworld of interest hanging on every word they uttered, they told each\r\nother of the first delightful dawnings of that affection which had\r\nsprung up between them, and which they fondly believed neither time nor\r\ncircumstance would have the power to change or subvert.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the old admiral was surprised that Charles was so\r\npatient, and had not been to him to demand the result of his\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nBut he knew not on what rapid pinions time flies, when in the presence\r\nof those whom we love. What was an actual hour, was but a fleeting\r\nminute to Charles Holland, as he sat with Flora\'s hand clasped in his,\r\nand looking at her sweet face.\r\n\r\nAt length a clock striking reminded him of his engagement with his\r\nuncle, and he reluctantly rose.\r\n\r\n"Dear Flora," he said, "I am going to sit up to watch to-night, so be\r\nunder no sort of apprehension."\r\n\r\n"I will feel doubly safe," she said.\r\n\r\n"I have now something to talk to my uncle about, and must leave you."\r\n\r\nFlora smiled, and held out her hand to him. He pressed it to his heart.\r\nHe knew not what impulse came over him then, but for the first time he\r\nkissed the cheek of the beautiful girl.\r\n\r\nWith a heightened colour she gently repulsed him. He took a long\r\nlingering look at her as he passed out of the room, and when the door\r\nwas closed between them, the sensation he experienced was as if some\r\nsudden cloud had swept across the face of the sun, dimming to a vast\r\nextent its precious lustre.\r\n\r\nA strange heaviness came across his spirits, which before had been so\r\nunaccountably raised. He felt as if the shadow of some coming evil was\r\nresting on his soul--as if some momentous calamity was preparing for\r\nhim, which would almost be enough to drive him to madness, and\r\nirredeemable despair.\r\n\r\n"What can this be," he exclaimed, "that thus oppresses me? What feeling\r\nis this that seems to tell me, I shall never again see Flora\r\nBannerworth?"\r\n\r\nUnconsciously he uttered these words, which betrayed the nature of his\r\nworst forebodings.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is weakness," he then added. "I must fight out against this;\r\nit is mere nervousness. I must not endure it, I will not suffer myself\r\nthus to become the sport of imagination. Courage, courage, Charles\r\nHolland. There are real evils enough, without your adding to them by\r\nthose of a disordered fancy. Courage, courage, courage."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMIRAL\'S OPINION.--THE REQUEST OF CHARLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles then sought the admiral, whom he found with his hands behind\r\nhim, pacing to and fro in one of the long walks of the garden, evidently\r\nin a very unsettled state of mind. When Charles appeared, he quickened\r\nhis pace, and looked in such a state of unusual perplexity that it was\r\nquite ridiculous to observe him.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, uncle, you have made up your mind thoroughly by this time?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that."\r\n\r\n"Why, you have had long enough surely to think over it. I have not\r\ntroubled you soon."\r\n\r\n"Well, I cannot exactly say you have, but, somehow or another, I don\'t\r\nthink very fast, and I have an unfortunate propensity after a time of\r\ncoming exactly round to where I began."\r\n\r\n"Then, to tell the truth, uncle, you can come to no sort of conclusion."\r\n\r\n"Only one."\r\n\r\n"And what may that be?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that you are right in one thing, Charles, which is, that having\r\nsent a challenge to this fellow of a vampyre, you must fight him."\r\n\r\n"I suspect that that is a conclusion you had from the first, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is an obvious and a natural one. All your doubts, and\r\ntrouble, and perplexities, have been to try and find some excuse for not\r\nentertaining that opinion, and now that you really find it in vain to\r\nmake it, I trust that you will accede as you first promised to do, and\r\nnot seek by any means to thwart me."\r\n\r\n"I will not thwart you, my boy, although in my opinion you ought not to\r\nfight with a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Never mind that. We cannot urge that as a valid excuse, so long as he\r\nchooses to deny being one. And after all, if he be really wrongfully\r\nsuspected, you must admit that he is a very injured man."\r\n\r\n"Injured!--nonsense. If he is not a vampyre, he\'s some other\r\nout-of-the-way sort of fish, you may depend. He\'s the oddest-looking\r\nfellow ever I came across in all my born days, ashore or afloat."\r\n\r\n"Is he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is: and yet, when I come to look at the thing again in my mind,\r\nsome droll sights that I have seen come across my memory. The sea is the\r\nplace for wonders and for mysteries. Why, we see more in a day and a\r\nnight there, than you landsmen could contrive to make a whole\r\ntwelvemonth\'s wonder of."\r\n\r\n"But you never saw a vampyre, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that. I didn\'t know anything about vampyres till I\r\ncame here; but that was my ignorance, you know. There might have been\r\nlots of vampyres where I\'ve been, for all I know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly; but as regards this duel, will you wait now until\r\nto-morrow morning, before you take any further steps in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Till to-morrow morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Why, only a little while ago, you were all eagerness to have something\r\ndone off-hand."\r\n\r\n"Just so; but now I have a particular reason for waiting until to-morrow\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Have you? Well, as you please, boy--as you please. Have everything your\r\nown way."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, uncle; and now I have another favour to ask of you."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you know that Henry Bannerworth receives but a very small sum out\r\nof the whole proceeds of the estate here, which ought, but for his\r\nfather\'s extravagance, to be wholly at his disposal."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard."\r\n\r\n"I am certain he is at present distressed for money, and I have not\r\nmuch. Will you lend me fifty pounds, uncle, until my own affairs are\r\nsufficiently arranged to enable you to pay yourself again?"\r\n\r\n"Will I! of course I will."\r\n\r\n"I wish to offer that sum as an accommodation to Henry. From me, I dare\r\nsay he will receive it freely, because he must be convinced how freely\r\nit is offered; and, besides, they look upon me now almost as a member of\r\nthe family in consequence of my engagement with Flora."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, and quite correct too: there\'s a fifty-pound note, my boy;\r\ntake it, and do what you like with it, and when you want any more, come\r\nto me for it."\r\n\r\n"I knew I could trespass thus far on your kindness, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Trespass! It\'s no trespass at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, we will not fall out about the terms in which I cannot help\r\nexpressing my gratitude to you for many favours. To-morrow, you will\r\narrange the duel for me."\r\n\r\n"As you please. I don\'t altogether like going to that fellow\'s house\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, we can manage, I dare say, by note."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Do so. He puts me in mind altogether of a circumstance that\r\nhappened a good while ago, when I was at sea, and not so old a man as I\r\nam now."\r\n\r\n"Puts you in mind of a circumstance, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'s something like a fellow that figured in an affair that I know\r\na good deal about; only I do think as my chap was more mysterious by a\r\nd----d sight than this one."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes. When anything happens in an odd way at sea, it is as odd\r\nagain as anything that occurs on land, my boy, you may depend."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you only fancy that, uncle, because you have spent so long a time\r\nat sea."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t imagine it, you rascal. What can you have on shore equal to\r\nwhat we have at sea? Why, the sights that come before us would make you\r\nlandsmen\'s hairs stand up on end, and never come down again."\r\n\r\n"In the ocean, do you mean, that you see those sights, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure. I was once in the southern ocean, in a small frigate,\r\nlooking out for a seventy-four we were to join company with, when a man\r\nat the mast-head sung out that he saw her on the larboard bow. Well, we\r\nthought it was all right enough, and made away that quarter, when what\r\ndo you think it turned out to be?"\r\n\r\n"I really cannot say."\r\n\r\n"The head of a fish."\r\n\r\n"A fish!"\r\n\r\n"Yes! a d----d deal bigger than the hull of a vessel. He was swimming\r\nalong with his head just what I dare say he considered a shaving or so\r\nout of the water."\r\n\r\n"But where were the sails, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"The sails?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; your man at the mast-head must have been a poor seaman not to have\r\nmissed the sails."\r\n\r\n"All, that\'s one of your shore-going ideas, now. You know nothing\r\nwhatever about it. I\'ll tell you where the sails were, master Charley."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should like to know."\r\n\r\n"The spray, then, that he dashed up with a pair of fins that were close\r\nto his head, was in such a quantity, and so white, that they looked just\r\nlike sails."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you may say \'oh!\' but we all saw him--the whole ship\'s crew; and we\r\nsailed alongside of him for some time, till he got tired of us, and\r\nsuddenly dived down, making such a vortex in the water, that the ship\r\nshook again, and seemed for about a minute as if she was inclined to\r\nfollow him to the bottom of the sea."\r\n\r\n"And what do you suppose it was, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"How should I know?"\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see it again?"\r\n\r\n"Never; though others have caught a glimpse of him now and then in the\r\nsame ocean, but never came so near him as we did, that ever I heard of,\r\nat all events. They may have done so."\r\n\r\n"It is singular!"\r\n\r\n"Singular or not, it\'s a fool to what I can tell you. Why, I\'ve seen\r\nthings that, if I were to set about describing them to you, you would\r\nsay I was making up a romance."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; it\'s quite impossible, uncle, any one could ever suspect you of\r\nsuch a thing."\r\n\r\n"You\'d believe me, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I would."\r\n\r\n"Then here goes. I\'ll just tell you now of a circumstance that I haven\'t\r\nliked to mention to anybody yet."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because I didn\'t want to be continually fighting people for not\r\nbelieving it; but here you have it:--"\r\n\r\nWe were outward bound; a good ship, a good captain, and good messmates,\r\nyou know, go far towards making a prosperous voyage a pleasant and happy\r\none, and on this occasion we had every reasonable prospect of all.\r\n\r\nOur hands were all tried men--they had been sailors from infancy; none\r\nof your French craft, that serve an apprenticeship and then become land\r\nlubbers again. Oh, no, they were stanch and true, and loved the ocean as\r\nthe sluggard loves his bed, or the lover his mistress.\r\n\r\nAy, and for the matter of that, the love was a more enduring and a more\r\nhealthy love, for it increased with years, and made men love one\r\nanother, and they would stand by each other while they had a limb to\r\nlift--while they were able to chew a quid or wink an eye, leave alone\r\nwag a pigtail.\r\n\r\nWe were outward bound for Ceylon, with cargo, and were to bring spices\r\nand other matters home from the Indian market. The ship was new and\r\ngood--a pretty craft; she sat like a duck upon the water, and a stiff\r\nbreeze carried her along the surface of the waves without your rocking,\r\nand pitching, and tossing, like an old wash-tub at a mill-tail, as I\r\nhave had the misfortune to sail in more than once afore.\r\n\r\nNo, no, we were well laden, and well pleased, and weighed anchor with\r\nlight hearts and a hearty cheer.\r\n\r\nAway we went down the river, and soon rounded the North Foreland, and\r\nstood out in the Channel. The breeze was a steady and stiff one, and\r\ncarried us through the water as though it had been made for us.\r\n\r\n"Jack," said I to a messmate of mine, as he stood looking at the skies,\r\nthen at the sails, and finally at the water, with a graver air than I\r\nthought was at all consistent with the occasion or circumstances.\r\n\r\n"Well," he replied.\r\n\r\n"What ails you? You seem as melancholy as if we were about to cast lots\r\nwho should be eaten first. Are you well enough?"\r\n\r\n"I am hearty enough, thank Heaven," he said, "but I don\'t like this\r\nbreeze."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t like the breeze!" said I; "why, mate, it is as good and kind a\r\nbreeze as ever filled a sail. What would you have, a gale?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; I fear that."\r\n\r\n"With such a ship, and such a set of hearty able seamen, I think we\r\ncould manage to weather out the stiffest gale that ever whistled through\r\na yard."\r\n\r\n"That may be; I hope it is, and I really believe and think so."\r\n\r\n"Then what makes you so infernally mopish and melancholy?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but can\'t help it. It seems to me as though there was\r\nsomething hanging over us, and I can\'t tell what."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are the colours, Jack, at the masthead; they are flying over\r\nus with a hearty breeze."\r\n\r\n"Ah! ah!" said Jack, looking up at the colours, and then went away\r\nwithout saying anything more, for he had some piece of duty to perform.\r\n\r\nI thought my messmate had something on his mind that caused him to feel\r\nsad and uncomfortable, and I took no more notice of it; indeed, in the\r\ncourse of a day or two he was as merry as any of the rest, and had no\r\nmore melancholy that I could perceive, but was as comfortable as\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nWe had a gale off the coast of Biscay, and rode it out without the loss\r\nof a spar or a yard; indeed, without the slightest accident or rent of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jack, what do you think of our vessel?" said I.\r\n\r\n"She\'s like a duck upon water, rises and falls with the waves, and\r\ndoesn\'t tumble up and down like a hoop over stones."\r\n\r\n"No, no; she goes smoothly and sweetly; she is a gallant craft, and this\r\nis her first voyage, and I predict a prosperous one."\r\n\r\n"I hope so," he said.\r\n\r\nWell, we went on prosperously enough for about three weeks; the ocean\r\nwas as calm and as smooth as a meadow, the breeze light but good, and we\r\nstemmed along majestically over the deep blue waters, and passed coast\r\nafter coast, though all around was nothing but the apparently pathless\r\nmain in sight.\r\n\r\n"A better sailer I never stepped into," said the captain one day; "it\r\nwould be a pleasure to live and die in such a vessel."\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, we had been three weeks or thereabouts, when one\r\nmorning, after the sun was up and the decks washed, we saw a strange man\r\nsitting on one of the water-casks that were on deck, for, being full, we\r\nwere compelled to stow some of them on deck.\r\n\r\nYou may guess those on deck did a little more than stare at this strange\r\nand unexpected apparition. By jingo, I never saw men open their eyes\r\nwider in all my life, nor was I any exception to the rule. I stared, as\r\nwell I might; but we said nothing for some minutes, and the stranger\r\nlooked calmly on us, and then cocked his eye with a nautical air up at\r\nthe sky, as if he expected to receive a twopenny-post letter from St.\r\nMichael, or a _billet doux_ from the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n"Where has he come from?" said one of the men in a low tone to his\r\ncompanion, who was standing by him at that moment.\r\n\r\n"How can I tell?" replied his companion. "He may have dropped from the\r\nclouds; he seems to be examining the road; perhaps he is going back."\r\n\r\nThe stranger sat all this time with the most extreme and provoking\r\ncoolness and unconcern; he deigned us but a passing notice, but it was\r\nvery slight.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, spare man--what is termed long and lathy--but he was\r\nevidently a powerful man. He had a broad chest, and long, sinewy arms, a\r\nhooked nose, and a black, eagle eye. His hair was curly, but frosted by\r\nage; it seemed as though it had been tinged with white at the\r\nextremities, but he was hale and active otherwise, to judge from\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, there was a singular repulsiveness about him\r\nthat I could not imagine the cause, or describe; at the same time there\r\nwas an air of determination in his wild and singular-looking eyes, and\r\nover their whole there was decidedly an air and an appearance so\r\nsinister as to be positively disagreeable.\r\n\r\n"Well," said I, after we had stood some minutes, "where did you come\r\nfrom, shipmate?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and then up at the sky, in a knowing manner.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, that won\'t do; you have none of Peter Wilkins\'s wings, and\r\ncouldn\'t come on the aerial dodge; it won\'t do; how did you get here?"\r\n\r\nHe gave me an awful wink, and made a sort of involuntary movement, which\r\njumped him up a few inches, and he bumped down again on the water-cask.\r\n\r\n"That\'s as much as to say," thought I, "that he\'s sat himself on it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and inform the captain," said I, "of this affair; he\'ll hardly\r\nbelieve me when I tell him, I am sure."\r\n\r\nSo saying, I left the deck and went to the cabin, where the captain was\r\nat breakfast, and related to him what I had seen respecting the\r\nstranger. The captain looked at me with an air of disbelief, and said,--\r\n\r\n"What?--do you mean to say there\'s a man on board we haven\'t seen\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do, captain. I never saw him afore, and he\'s sitting beating his\r\nheels on the water-cask on deck."\r\n\r\n"The devil!"\r\n\r\n"He is, I assure you, sir; and he won\'t answer any questions."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to that. I\'ll see if I can\'t make the lubber say something,\r\nproviding his tongue\'s not cut out. But how came he on board? Confound\r\nit, he can\'t be the devil, and dropped from the moon."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know, captain," said I. "He is evil-looking enough, to my mind,\r\nto be the father of evil, but it\'s ill bespeaking attentions from that\r\nquarter at any time."\r\n\r\n"Go on, lad; I\'ll come up after you."\r\n\r\nI left the cabin, and I heard the captain coming after me. When I got on\r\ndeck, I saw he had not moved from the place where I left him. There was\r\na general commotion among the crew when they heard of the occurrence,\r\nand all crowded round him, save the man at the wheel, who had to remain\r\nat his post.\r\n\r\nThe captain now came forward, and the men fell a little back as he\r\napproached. For a moment the captain stood silent, attentively examining\r\nthe stranger, who was excessively cool, and stood the scrutiny with the\r\nsame unconcern that he would had the captain been looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n"Well, my man," said the captain, "how did you come here?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m part of the cargo," he said, with an indescribable leer.\r\n\r\n"Part of the cargo be d----d!" said the captain, in sudden rage, for he\r\nthought the stranger was coming his jokes too strong. "I know you are\r\nnot in the bills of lading."\r\n\r\n"I\'m contraband," replied the stranger; "and my uncle\'s the great chain\r\nof Tartary."\r\n\r\nThe captain stared, as well he might, and did not speak for some\r\nminutes; all the while the stranger kept kicking his heels against the\r\nwater-casks and squinting up at the skies; it made us feel very queer.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must confess you are not in the regular way of trading."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said the stranger; "I am contraband--entirely contraband."\r\n\r\n"And how did you come on board?"\r\n\r\nAt this question the stranger again looked curiously up at the skies,\r\nand continued to do so for more than a minute; he then turned his gaze\r\nupon the captain.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the captain; "eloquent dumb show won\'t do with me; you\r\ndidn\'t come, like Mother Shipton, upon a birch broom. How did you come\r\non board my vessel?"\r\n\r\n"I walked on board," said the stranger.\r\n\r\n"You walked on board; and where did you conceal yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Below."\r\n\r\n"Very good; and why didn\'t you stay below altogether?"\r\n\r\n"Because I wanted fresh air. I\'m in a delicate state of health, you see;\r\nit doesn\'t do to stay in a confined place too long."\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle!" said the captain; it was his usual oath when\r\nanything bothered him, and he could not make it out. "Confound the\r\nbinnacle!--what a delicate-looking animal you are. I wish you had stayed\r\nwhere you were; your delicacy would have been all the same to me.\r\nDelicate, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very," said the stranger, coolly.\r\n\r\nThere was something so comic in the assertion of his delicateness of\r\nhealth, that we should all have laughed; but we were somewhat scared,\r\nand had not the inclination.\r\n\r\n"How have you lived since you came on board?" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n"Very indifferently."\r\n\r\n"But how? What have you eaten? and what have you drank?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, I assure you. All I did while was below was--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I sucked my thumbs like a polar bear in its winter quarters."\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the stranger put his two thumbs into his mouth, and\r\nextraordinary thumbs they were, too, for each would have filled an\r\nordinary man\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n"These," said the stranger, pulling them out, and gazing at them\r\nwistfully, and with a deep sigh he continued,--\r\n\r\n"These were thumbs at one time; but they are nothing now to what they\r\nwere."\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle!" muttered the captain to himself, and then he\r\nadded, aloud,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s cheap living, however; but where are you going to, and why did you\r\ncome aboard?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted a cheap cruise, and I am going there and back."\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s where we are going," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Then we are brothers," exclaimed the stranger, hopping off the\r\nwater-cask like a kangaroo, and bounding towards the captain, holding\r\nout his hand as though he would have shaken hands with him.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the captain; "I can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t do it!" exclaimed the stranger, angrily. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t have anything to do with contraband articles; I am a fair\r\ntrader, and do all above board. I haven\'t a chaplain on board, or he\r\nshould offer up prayers for your preservation, and the recovery of your\r\nhealth, which seems so delicate."\r\n\r\n"That be--"\r\n\r\nThe stranger didn\'t finish the sentence; he merely screwed his mouth up\r\ninto an incomprehensible shape, and puffed out a lot of breath, with\r\nsome force, and which sounded very much like a whistle: but, oh, what\r\nthick breath he had, it was as much like smoke as anything I ever saw,\r\nand so my shipmate said.\r\n\r\n"I say, captain," said the stranger, as he saw him pacing the deck.\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"Just send me up some beef and biscuit, and some coffee royal--be sure\r\nit\'s royal, do you hear, because I\'m partial to brandy, it\'s the only\r\ngood thing there is on earth."\r\n\r\nI shall not easily forget the captain\'s look as he turned towards the\r\nstranger, and gave his huge shoulders a shrug, as much as to say,--\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t help it now; he\'s here, and I can\'t throw him overboard."\r\n\r\nThe coffee, beef, and biscuit were sent him, and the stranger seemed to\r\neat them with great _gout_, and drank the coffee with much relish, and\r\nreturned the things, saying,\r\n\r\n"Your captain is an excellent cook; give him my compliments."\r\n\r\nI thought the captain would think that was but a left-handed compliment,\r\nand look more angry than pleased, but no notice was taken of it.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, but this man had impressed upon all in the vessel some\r\nsingular notion of his being more than he should be--more than a mere\r\nmortal, and not one endeavoured to interfere with him; the captain was a\r\nstout and dare-devil a fellow as you would well met with, yet he seemed\r\ntacitly to acknowledge more than he would say, for he never after took\r\nany further notice of the stranger nor he of him.\r\n\r\nThey had barely any conversation, simply a civil word when they first\r\nmet, and so forth; but there was little or no conversation of any kind\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe stranger slept upon deck, and lived upon deck entirely; he never\r\nonce went below after we saw him, and his own account of being below so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThis was very well, but the night-watch did not enjoy his society, and\r\nwould have willingly dispensed with it at that hour so particularly\r\nlonely and dejected upon the broad ocean, and perhaps a thousand miles\r\naway from the nearest point of land.\r\n\r\nAt this dread and lonely hour, when no sound reaches the ear and\r\ndisturbs the wrapt stillness of the night, save the whistling of the\r\nwind through the cordage, or an occasional dash of water against the\r\nvessel\'s side, the thoughts of the sailor are fixed on far distant\r\nobjects--his own native land and the friends and loved ones he has left\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe then thinks of the wilderness before, behind, and around him; of the\r\nimmense body of water, almost in places bottomless; gazing upon such a\r\nscene, and with thoughts as strange and indefinite as the very\r\nboundless expanse before him, it is no wonder if he should become\r\nsuperstitious; the time and place would, indeed unbidden, conjure up\r\nthoughts and feelings of a fearful character and intensity.\r\n\r\nThe stranger at such times would occupy his favourite seat on the water\r\ncask, and looking up at the sky and then on the ocean, and between\r\nwhiles he would whistle a strange, wild, unknown melody.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the sailors used to creep up in knots and bumps when they\r\nheard it; the wind used to whistle as an accompaniment and pronounce\r\nfearful sounds to their ears.\r\n\r\nThe wind had been highly favourable from the first, and since the\r\nstranger had been discovered it had blown fresh, and we went along at a\r\nrapid rate, stemming the water, and dashing the spray off from the bows,\r\nand cutting the water like a shark.\r\n\r\nThis was very singular to us, we couldn\'t understand it, neither could\r\nthe captain, and we looked very suspiciously at the stranger, and wished\r\nhim at the bottom, for the freshness of the wind now became a gale, and\r\nyet the ship came through the water steadily, and away we went before\r\nthe wind, as if the devil drove us; and mind I don\'t mean to say he\r\ndidn\'t.\r\n\r\nThe gale increased to a hurricane, and though we had not a stitch of\r\ncanvass out, yet we drove before the gale as if we had been shot out of\r\nthe mouth of a gun.\r\n\r\nThe stranger still sat on the water casks, and all night long he kept up\r\nhis infernal whistle. Now, sailors don\'t like to hear any one whistle\r\nwhen there\'s such a gale blowing over their heads--it\'s like asking for\r\nmore; but he would persist, and the louder and stronger the wind blew,\r\nthe louder he whistled.\r\n\r\nAt length there came a storm of rain, lightning, and wind. We were\r\ntossed mountains high, and the foam rose over the vessel, and often\r\nentirely over our heads, and the men were lashed to their posts to\r\nprevent being washed away.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger still lay on the water casks, kicking his heels and\r\nwhistling his infernal tune, always the same. He wasn\'t washed away nor\r\nmoved by the action of the water; indeed, we heartily hoped and expected\r\nto see both him and the water cask floated overboard at every minute;\r\nbut, as the captain said,--\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle! the old water tub seems as if it were screwed on\r\nto the deck, and won\'t move off and he on the top of it."\r\n\r\nThere was a strong inclination to throw him overboard, and the men\r\nconversed in low whispers, and came round the captain, saying,--\r\n\r\n"We have come, captain, to ask you what you think of this strange man\r\nwho has come so mysteriously on board?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell what to think, lads; he\'s past thinking about--he\'s\r\nsomething above my comprehension altogether, I promise you."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, we are thinking much of the same thing, captain."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"That he ain\'t exactly one of our sort."\r\n\r\n"No, he\'s no sailor, certainly; and yet, for a land lubber, he\'s about\r\nas rum a customer as ever I met with."\r\n\r\n"So he is, sir."\r\n\r\n"He stands salt water well; and I must say that I couldn\'t lay a top of\r\nthose water casks in that style very well."\r\n\r\n"Nor nobody amongst us, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, he\'s in nobody\'s way, it he?--nobody wants to take his\r\nberth, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other somewhat blank; they didn\'t understand the\r\nmeaning at all--far from it; and the idea of any one\'s wanting to take\r\nthe stranger\'s place on the water casks was so outrageously ludicrous,\r\nthat at any other time they would have considered it a devilish good\r\njoke and have never ceased laughing at it.\r\n\r\nHe paused some minutes, and then one of them said,--\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that we envy him his berth, captain, \'cause nobody else could\r\nlive there for a moment. Any one amongst us that had been there would\r\nhave been washed overboard a thousand times over."\r\n\r\n"So they would," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, he\'s more than us."\r\n\r\n"Very likely; but how can I help that?"\r\n\r\n"We think he\'s the main cause of all this racket in the heavens--the\r\nstorm and hurricane; and that, in short, if he remains much longer we\r\nshall all sink."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for it. I don\'t think we are in any danger, and had the\r\nstrange being any power to prevent it, he would assuredly do so, lest he\r\ngot drowned."\r\n\r\n"But we think if he were thrown overboard all would be well."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, captain, you may depend upon it he\'s the cause of all the\r\nmischief. Throw him overboard and that\'s all we want."\r\n\r\n"I shall not throw him overboard, even if I could do such a thing; and I\r\nam by no means sure of anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"We do not ask it, sir."\r\n\r\n"What do you desire?"\r\n\r\n"Leave to throw him overboard--it is to save our own lives."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you do any such thing; he\'s in nobody\'s way."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s always a whistling. Only hark now, and in such a hurricane as\r\nthis, it is dreadful to think of it. What else can we do, sir?--he\'s not\r\nhuman."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the stranger\'s whistling came clear upon their ears;\r\nthere was the same wild, unearthly notes as before, but the cadences\r\nwere stronger, and there was a supernatural clearness in all the tones.\r\n\r\n"There now," said another, "he\'s kicking the water cask with his heels."\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle!" said the captain; "it sounds like short peals\r\nof thunder. Go and talk to him, lads."\r\n\r\n"And if that won\'t do, sir, may we--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me any questions. I don\'t think a score of the best men that\r\nwere ever born could move him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind trying," said one.\r\n\r\nUpon this the whole of the men moved to the spot where the water casks\r\nwere standing and the stranger lay.\r\n\r\nThere was he, whistling like fury, and, at the same time, beating his\r\nheels to the tune against the empty casks. We came up to him, and he\r\ntook no notice of us at all, but kept on in the same way.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" shouted one.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" shouted another.\r\n\r\nNo notice, however, was taken of us, and one of our number, a big,\r\nherculean fellow, an Irishman, seized him by the leg, either to make him\r\nget up, or, as we thought, to give him a lift over our heads into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had scarcely got his fingers round the calf of the leg, when\r\nthe stranger pinched his leg so tight against the water cask, that he\r\ncould not move, and was as effectually pinned as if he had been nailed\r\nthere. The stranger, after he had finished a bar of the music, rose\r\ngradually to a sitting posture, and without the aid of his hands, and\r\nlooking the unlucky fellow in the face, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"My hand," said the fellow.\r\n\r\n"Take it then," he said.\r\n\r\nHe did take it, and we saw that there was blood on it.\r\n\r\nThe stranger stretched out his left hand, and taking him by the breech,\r\nhe lifted him, without any effort, upon the water-cask beside him.\r\n\r\nWe all stared at this, and couldn\'t help it; and we were quite convinced\r\nwe could not throw him overboard, but he would probably have no\r\ndifficulty in throwing us overboard.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you want?" he again exclaimed to us all.\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another, and had scarce courage to speak; at length I\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"We wish you to leave off whistling."\r\n\r\n"Leave off whistling!" he said. "And why should I do anything of the\r\nkind?"\r\n\r\n"Because it brings the wind."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! why, that\'s the very reason I am whistling, to bring the wind."\r\n\r\n"But we don\'t want so much."\r\n\r\n"Pho! pho! you don\'t know what\'s good for you--it\'s a beautiful breeze,\r\nand not a bit too stiff."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a hurricane."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense."\r\n\r\n"But it is."\r\n\r\n"Now you see how I\'ll prove you are wrong in a minute. You see my hair,\r\ndon\'t you?" he said, after he took off his cap. "Very well, look now."\r\n\r\nHe got up on the water-cask, and stood bolt upright; and running his\r\nfingers through his hair, made it all stand straight on end.\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle!" said the captain, "if ever I saw the like."\r\n\r\n"There," said the stranger, triumphantly, "don\'t tell me there\'s any\r\nwind to signify; don\'t you see, it doesn\'t even move one of my grey\r\nhairs; and if it blew as hard as you say, I am certain it would move a\r\nhair."\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle!" muttered the captain as he walked away. "D--n\r\nthe cabouse, if he ain\'t older than I am--he\'s too many for me and\r\neverybody else."\r\n\r\n"Are you satisfied?"\r\n\r\nWhat could we say?--we turned away and left the place, and stood at our\r\nquarters--there was no help for it--we were impelled to grin and abide\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had left the place he put his cap on again and sat down on\r\nthe water-casks, and then took leave of his prisoner, whom he set free,\r\nand there lay at full length on his back, with his legs hanging down.\r\nOnce more he began to whistle most furiously, and beat time with his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nFor full three weeks did he continue at this game night and day, without\r\nany interruption, save such as he required to consume enough coffee\r\nroyal, junk, and biscuit, as would have served three hearty men.\r\n\r\nWell, about that time, one night the whistling ceased and he began to\r\nsing--oh! it was singing--such a voice! Gog and Magog in Guildhall,\r\nLondon, when they spoke were nothing to him--it was awful; but the wind\r\ncalmed down to a fresh and stiff breeze. He continued at this game for\r\nthree whole days and nights, and on the fourth it ceased, and when we\r\nwent to take his coffee royal to him he was gone.\r\n\r\nWe hunted about everywhere, but he was entirely gone, and in three weeks\r\nafter we safely cast anchor, having performed our voyage in a good month\r\nunder the usual time; and had it been an old vessel she would have\r\nleaked and stinted like a tub from the straining; however, we were glad\r\nenough to get in, and were curiously inquisitive as to what was put in\r\nour vessel to come back with, for as the captain said,--\r\n\r\n"Confound the binnacle! I\'ll have no more contraband articles if I can\r\nhelp it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING BY MOONLIGHT IN THE PARK.--THE TURRET WINDOW IN THE\r\nHALL.--THE LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe old admiral showed such a strong disposition to take offence at\r\nCharles if he should presume, for a moment, to doubt the truth of the\r\nnarrative that was thus communicated to him, that the latter would not\r\nanger him by so doing, but confined his observations upon it to saying\r\nthat he considered it was very wonderful, and very extraordinary, and so\r\non, which very well satisfied the old man.\r\n\r\nThe day was now, however, getting far advanced, and Charles Holland\r\nbegan to think of his engagement with the vampyre. He read and read the\r\nletter over and over again, but he could not come to a correct\r\nconclusion as to whether it intended to imply that he, Sir Francis\r\nVarney, would wish to fight him at the hour and place mentioned, or\r\nmerely give him a meeting as a preliminary step.\r\n\r\nHe was rather, on the whole, inclined to think that some explanation\r\nwould be offered by Varney, but at all events he persevered in his\r\ndetermination of going well armed, lest anything in the shape of\r\ntreachery should be intended.\r\n\r\nAs nothing of any importance occurred now in the interval of time till\r\nnearly midnight, we will at once step to that time, and our readers will\r\nsuppose it to be a quarter to twelve o\'clock at night, and young Charles\r\nHolland on the point of leaving the house, to keep his appointment by\r\nthe pollard oak, with the mysterious Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nHe placed his loaded pistols conveniently in his pocket, so that at a\r\nmoment\'s notice he could lay hands on them, and then wrapping himself up\r\nin a travelling cloak he had brought with him to Bannerworth Hall, he\r\nprepared to leave his chamber.\r\n\r\nThe moon still shone, although now somewhat on the wane, and although\r\nthere were certainly many clouds in the sky they were but of a light\r\nfleecy character, and very little interrupted the rays of light that\r\ncame from the nearly full disc of the moon.\r\n\r\nFrom his window he could not perceive the spot in the park where he was\r\nto meet Varney, because the room in which he was occupied not a\r\nsufficiently high place in the house to enable him to look over a belt\r\nof trees that stopped the view. From almost any of the upper windows the\r\npollard oak could be seen.\r\n\r\nIt so happened now that the admiral had been placed in a room\r\nimmediately above the one occupied by his nephew, and, as his mind was\r\nfull of how he should manage with regard to arranging the preliminaries\r\nof the duel between Charles and Varney on the morrow, he found it\r\ndifficult to sleep; and after remaining in bed about twenty minutes, and\r\nfinding that each moment he was only getting more and more restless, he\r\nadopted a course which he always did under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe rose and dressed himself again, intending to sit up for an hour and\r\nthen turn into bed and try a second time to get to sleep. But he had no\r\nmeans of getting a light, so he drew the heavy curtain from before the\r\nwindow, and let in as much of the moonlight as he could.\r\n\r\nThis window commanded a most beautiful and extensive view, for from it\r\nthe eye could carry completely over the tops of the tallest trees, so\r\nthat there was no interruption whatever to the prospect, which was as\r\nextensive as it was delightful.\r\n\r\nEven the admiral, who never would confess to seeing much beauty in\r\nscenery where water formed not a large portion of it, could not resist\r\nopening his window and looking out, with a considerable degree of\r\nadmiration, upon wood and dale, as they were illuminated by the moon\'s\r\nrays, softened, and rendered, if anything, more beautiful by the light\r\nvapours, through which they had to struggle to make their way.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland, in order to avoid the likelihood of meeting with any\r\none who would question him as to where he was going, determined upon\r\nleaving his room by the balcony, which, as we are aware, presented ample\r\nfacilities for his so doing.\r\n\r\nHe cast a glance at the portrait in the panel before he left the\r\napartment, and then saying,--\r\n\r\n"For you, dear Flora, for you I essay this meeting with the fearful\r\noriginal of that portrait," he immediately opened his window, and\r\nstepped out on to the balcony.\r\n\r\nYoung and active as was Charles Holland, to descend from that balcony\r\npresented to him no difficulty whatever, and he was, in a very few\r\nmoments, safe in the garden of Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\nHe never thought, for a moment, to look up, or he would, in an instant,\r\nhave seen the white head of his old uncle, as it was projected over the\r\nsill of the window of his chamber.\r\n\r\nThe drop of Charles from the balcony of his window, just made sufficient\r\nnoise to attract the admiral\'s attention, and, then, before he could\r\nthink of making any alarm, he saw Charles walking hastily across a grass\r\nplot, which was sufficiently in the light of the moon to enable the\r\nadmiral at once to recognise him, and leave no sort of doubt as to his\r\npositive identity.\r\n\r\nOf course, upon discovering that it was Charles, the necessity for\r\nmaking an alarm no longer existed, and, indeed, not knowing what it was\r\nthat had induced him to leave his chamber, a moment\'s reflection\r\nsuggested to him the propriety of not even calling to Charles, lest he\r\nshould defeat some discovery which he might be about to make.\r\n\r\n"He has heard something, or seen something," thought the admiral, "and\r\nis gone to find out what it is. I only wish I was with him; but up here\r\nI can do nothing at all, that\'s quite clear."\r\n\r\nCharles, he saw, walked very rapidly, and like a man who has some fixed\r\ndestination which he wishes to reach as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen he dived among the trees which skirted one side of the flower\r\ngardens, the admiral was more puzzled than ever, and he said--\r\n\r\n"Now where on earth is he off to? He is fully dressed, and has his cloak\r\nabout him."\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments\' reflection he decided that, having seen something\r\nsuspicious, Charles must have got up, and dressed himself, to fathom it.\r\n\r\nThe moment this idea became fairly impressed upon his mind, he left his\r\nbedroom, and descended to where one of the brothers he knew was sitting\r\nup, keeping watch during the night. It was Henry who was so on guard;\r\nand when the admiral came into the room, he uttered an expression of\r\nsurprise to find him up, for it was now some time past twelve o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"I have come to tell you that Charles has left the house," said the\r\nadmiral.\r\n\r\n"Left the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I saw him just now go across the garden."\r\n\r\n"And you are sure it was he?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure. I saw him by the moonlight cross the green plot."\r\n\r\n"Then you may depend he has seen or heard something, and gone alone to\r\nfind out what it is rather than give any alarm."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I think."\r\n\r\n"It must be so. I will follow him, if you can show me exactly which way\r\nhe went."\r\n\r\n"That I can easily. And in case I should have made any mistake, which it\r\nis not at all likely, we can go to his room first and see if it is\r\nempty."\r\n\r\n"A good thought, certainly; that will at once put an end to all doubt\r\nupon the question."\r\n\r\nThey both immediately proceeded to Charles\'s room, and then the\r\nadmiral\'s accuracy of identification of his nephew was immediately\r\nproved by finding that Charles was not there, and that the window was\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\n"You see I am right," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"You are," cried Henry; "but what have we here?"\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Here on the dressing-table. Here are no less than three letters, all\r\nlaid as it on purpose to catch the eye of the first one who might enter\r\nthe room."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"You perceive them?"\r\n\r\nHenry held them to the light, and after a moment\'s inspection of them,\r\nhe said, in a voice of much surprise,--\r\n\r\n"Good God! what is the meaning of this?"\r\n\r\n"The meaning of what?"\r\n\r\n"The letters are addressed to parties in the house here. Do you not\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\n"To whom?"\r\n\r\n"One to Admiral Bell--"\r\n\r\n"The deuce!"\r\n\r\n"Another to me, and the third to my sister Flora. There is some new\r\nmystery here."\r\n\r\nThe admiral looked at the superscription of one of the letters which was\r\nhanded to him in silent amazement. Then he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Set down the light, and let us read them."\r\n\r\nHenry did so, and then they simultaneously opened the epistles which\r\nwere severally addressed to them. There was a silence, as of the very\r\ngrave, for some moments, and then the old admiral staggered to a seat,\r\nas he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Am I dreaming--am I dreaming?"\r\n\r\n"Is this possible?" said Henry, in a voice of deep emotion, as he\r\nallowed the note addressed to him to drop on to the floor.\r\n\r\n"D--n it, what does yours say?" cried the old admiral, in a louder tone.\r\n\r\n"Read it--what says yours?"\r\n\r\n"Read it--I\'m amazed."\r\n\r\nThe letters were exchanged, and read by each with the same breathless\r\nattention they had bestowed upon their own; after which, they both\r\nlooked at each other in silence, pictures of amazement, and the most\r\nabsolute state of bewilderment.\r\n\r\nNot to keep our readers in suspense, we at once transcribe each of these\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nThe one to the admiral contained these words,--\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR UNCLE,\r\n\r\n     "Of course you will perceive the prudence of keeping this letter\r\n     to yourself, but the fact is, I have now made up my mind to leave\r\n     Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\n     "Flora Bannerworth is not now the person she was when first I\r\n     knew her and loved her. Such being the case, and she having\r\n     altered, not I, she cannot accuse me of fickleness.\r\n\r\n     "I still love the Flora Bannerworth I first knew, but I cannot\r\n     make my wife one who is subject to the visitations of a vampyre.\r\n\r\n     "I have remained here long enough now to satisfy myself that this\r\n     vampyre business is no delusion. I am quite convinced that it is\r\n     a positive fact, and that, after death, Flora will herself become\r\n     one of the horrible existences known by that name.\r\n\r\n     "I will communicate to you from the first large city on the\r\n     continent whither I am going, at which I make any stay, and in\r\n     the meantime, make what excuses you like at Bannerworth Hall,\r\n     which I advise you to leave as quickly as you can, and believe me\r\n     to be, my dear uncle, yours truly,\r\n\r\n     "CHARLES HOLLAND."\r\n\r\nHenry\'s letter was this:--\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     "If you calmly and dispassionately consider the painful and\r\n     distressing circumstances in which your family are placed, I am\r\n     sure that, far from blaming me for the step which this note will\r\n     announce to you I have taken, you will be the first to give me\r\n     credit for acting with an amount of prudence and foresight which\r\n     was highly necessary under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n     "If the supposed visits of a vampyre to your sister Flora had\r\n     turned out, as first I hoped they would, a delusion and been\r\n     in any satisfactory manner explained away I should certainly have\r\n     felt pride and pleasure in fulfilling my engagement to that young\r\n     lady.\r\n\r\n     "You must, however, yourself feel that the amount of evidence in\r\n     favour of a belief that an actual vampyre has visited Flora,\r\n     enforces a conviction of its truth.\r\n\r\n     "I cannot, therefore, make her my wife under such very singular\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     "Perhaps you may blame me for not taking at once advantage of the\r\n     permission given me to forego my engagement when first I came to\r\n     your house; but the fact is, I did not then in the least believe\r\n     in the existence of the vampyre, but since a positive conviction\r\n     of that most painful fact has now forced itself upon me, I beg to\r\n     decline the honour of an alliance which I had at one time looked\r\n     forward to with the most considerable satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     "I shall be on the continent as fast as conveyances can take me,\r\n     therefore, should you entertain any romantic notions of calling\r\n     me to an account for a course of proceeding I think perfectly and\r\n     fully justifiable, you will not find me.\r\n\r\n     "Accept the assurances of my respect for yourself and pity for\r\n     your sister, and believe me to be, my dear sir, your sincere\r\n     friend,\r\n\r\n     "CHARLES HOLLAND."\r\n\r\nThese two letters might well make the admiral stare at Henry\r\nBannerworth, and Henry stare at him.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence so utterly and entirely unexpected by both of them, was\r\nenough to make them doubt the evidence of their own senses. But there\r\nwere the letters, as a damning evidence of the outrageous fact, and\r\nCharles Holland was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was the admiral who first recovered from the stunning effect of the\r\nepistles, and he, with a gesture of perfect fury, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"The scoundrel--the cold-blooded villain! I renounce him for ever! he is\r\nno nephew of mine; he is some d----d imposter! Nobody with a dash of my\r\nfamily blood in his veins would have acted so to save himself from a\r\nthousand deaths."\r\n\r\n"Who shall we trust now," said Henry, "when those whom we take to our\r\ninmost hearts deceive us thus? This is the greatest shock I have yet\r\nreceived. If there be a pang greater than another, surely it is to be\r\nfound in the faithlessness and heartlessness of one we loved and\r\ntrusted."\r\n\r\n"He is a scoundrel!" roared the admiral. "D--n him, he\'ll die on a\r\ndunghill, and that\'s too good a place for him. I cast him off--I\'ll find\r\nhim out, and old as I am, I\'ll fight him--I\'ll wring his neck, the\r\nrascal; and, as for poor dear Miss Flora, God bless her! I\'ll--I\'ll\r\nmarry her myself, and make her an admiral.--I\'ll marry her myself. Oh,\r\nthat I should be uncle to such a rascal!"\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself," said Henry, "no one can blame you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can; I had no right to be his uncle, and I was an old fool to\r\nlove him."\r\n\r\nThe old man sat down, and his voice became broken with emotion as he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Sir, I tell you I would have died willingly rather than this should\r\nhave happened. This will kill me now,--I shall die now of shame and\r\ngrief."\r\n\r\nTears gushed from the admiral\'s eyes and the sight of the noble old\r\nman\'s emotion did much to calm the anger of Henry which, although he\r\nsaid but little, was boiling at his heart like a volcano.\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell," he said, "you have nothing to do with this business; we\r\ncan not blame you for the heartlessness of another. I have but one\r\nfavour to ask of you."\r\n\r\n"What--what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Say no more about him at all."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help saying something about him. You ought to turn me out of\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid! What for?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m his uncle--his d----d old fool of an uncle, that always\r\nthought so much of him."\r\n\r\n"Nay, my good sir, that was a fault on the right side, and cannot\r\ndiscredit you. I thought him the most perfect of human beings."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I could but have guessed this."\r\n\r\n"It was impossible. Such duplicity never was equalled in this world--it\r\nwas impossible to foresee it."\r\n\r\n"Hold--hold! did he give you fifty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Did he give you fifty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"Give me fifty pounds! Most decidedly not; what made you think of such a\r\nthing?"\r\n\r\n"Because to-day he borrowed fifty pounds of me, he said, to lend to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of the transaction until this moment."\r\n\r\n"The villain!"\r\n\r\n"No, doubt, sir, he wanted that amount to expedite his progress abroad."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, damme, if an angel had come to me and said \'Hilloa! Admiral\r\nBell, your nephew, Charles Holland, is a thundering rogue,\' I should\r\nhave said \'You\'re a liar!\'"\r\n\r\n"This is fighting against facts, my dear sir. He is gone--mention him no\r\nmore; forget him, as I shall endeavour myself to do, and persuade my\r\npoor sister to do."\r\n\r\n"Poor girl! what can we say to her?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, but give her all the letters, and let her be at once satisfied\r\nof the worthlessness of him she loved."\r\n\r\n"The best way. Her woman\'s pride will then come to her help."\r\n\r\n"I hope it will. She is of an honourable race, and I am sure she will\r\nnot condescend to shed a tear for such a man as Charles Holland has\r\nproved himself to be."\r\n\r\n"D--n him, I\'ll find him out, and make him fight you. He shall give you\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\n"No, no."\r\n\r\n"No? But he shall."\r\n\r\n"I cannot fight with him."\r\n\r\n"You cannot?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. He is too far beneath me now. I cannot fight on\r\nhonourable terms with one whom I despise as too dishonourable to contend\r\nwith. I have nothing now but silence and contempt."\r\n\r\n"I have though, for I\'ll break his neck when I see him, or he shall\r\nbreak mine. The villain! I\'m ashamed to stay here, my young friend."\r\n\r\n"How mistaken a view you take of this matter, my dear sir. As Admiral\r\nBell, a gentleman, a brave officer, and a man of the purest and most\r\nunblemished honour, you confer a distinction upon us by your presence\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nThe admiral wrung Henry by the hand, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"To-morrow--wait till to-morrow; we will talk over this matter to\r\nmorrow--I cannot to-night, I have not patience; but to-morrow, my dear\r\nboy, we will have it all out. God bless you. Good night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NOBLE CONFIDENCE OF FLORA BANNERWORTH IN HER LOVER.--HER OPINION OF\r\nTHE THREE LETTERS.--THE ADMIRAL\'S ADMIRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo describe the feelings of Henry Bannerworth on the occasion of this\r\napparent defalcation from the path of rectitude and honour by his\r\nfriend, as he had fondly imagined Charles Holland to be, would be next\r\nto impossible.\r\n\r\nIf, as we have taken occasion to say, it be a positive fact, that a\r\nnoble and a generous mind feels more acutely any heartlessness of this\r\ndescription from one on whom it has placed implicit confidence, than the\r\nmost deliberate and wicked of injuries from absolute strangers, we can\r\neasily conceive that Henry Bannerworth was precisely the person to feel\r\nmost acutely the conduct which all circumstances appeared to fix upon\r\nCharles Holland, upon whose faith, truth, and honour, he would have\r\nstaked his very existence but a few short hours before.\r\n\r\nWith such a bewildered sensation that he scarcely knew where he walked\r\nor whither to betake himself, did he repair to his own chamber, and\r\nthere he strove, with what energy he was able to bring to the task, to\r\nfind out some excuses, if he could, for Charles\'s conduct. But he could\r\nfind none. View it in what light he would, it presented but a picture of\r\nthe most heartless selfishness it had ever been his lot to encounter.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the letters, too, which Charles had written, materially\r\naggravated the moral delinquency of which he had been guilty; belief,\r\nfar better, had he not attempted an excuse at all than have attempted\r\nsuch excuses as were there put down in those epistles.\r\n\r\nA more cold blooded, dishonourable proceeding could not possibly be\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, that while he entertained a doubt with regard to the\r\nreality of the visitation of the vampyre to Flora Bannerworth, he had\r\nbeen willing to take to himself abundance of credit for the most\r\nhonourable feelings, and to induce a belief in the minds of all that an\r\nexalted feeling of honour, as well as a true affection that would know\r\nno change, kept him at the feet of her whom he loved.\r\n\r\nLike some braggart, who, when there is no danger, is a very hero, but\r\nwho, the moment he feels convinced he will be actually and truly called\r\nupon for an exhibition of his much-vaunted prowess, had Charles Holland\r\ndeserted the beautiful girl who, if anything, had now certainly, in her\r\nmisfortunes, a far higher claim upon his kindly feeling than before.\r\n\r\nHenry could not sleep, although, at the request of George, who offered\r\nto keep watch for him the remainder of the night he attempted to do so.\r\n\r\nHe in vain said to himself, "I will banish from my mind this most\r\nunworthy subject. I have told Admiral Bell that contempt is the only\r\nfeeling I can now have for his nephew, and yet I now find myself\r\ndwelling upon him, and upon his conduct, with a perseverance which is a\r\nfoe to my repose."\r\n\r\nAt length came the welcome and beautiful light of day, and Henry rose\r\nfevered and unrefreshed.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse now was to hold a consultation with his brother\r\nGeorge, as to what was to be done, and George advised that Mr.\r\nMarchdale, who as yet knew nothing of the matter, should be immediately\r\ninformed of it, and consulted, as being probably better qualified than\r\neither of them to come to a just, a cool, and a reasonable opinion upon\r\nthe painful circumstance, which it could not be expected that either of\r\nthem would be able to view calmly.\r\n\r\n"Let it be so, then," said Henry; "Mr. Marchdale shall decide for us."\r\n\r\nThey at once sought this friend of the family, who was in his own\r\nbed-room, and when Henry knocked at the door, Marchdale opened it\r\nhurriedly, eagerly inquiring what was the matter.\r\n\r\n"There is no alarm," said Henry. "We have only come to tell you of a\r\ncircumstance which has occurred during the night, and which will\r\nsomewhat surprise you."\r\n\r\n"Nothing calamitous, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Vexatious; and yet, I think it is a matter upon which we ought almost\r\nto congratulate ourselves. Read those two letters, and give us your\r\ncandid opinion upon them."\r\n\r\nHenry placed in Mr. Marchdale\'s hands the letter addressed to himself,\r\nas well as that to the admiral.\r\n\r\nMarchdale read them both with marked attention, but he did not exhibit\r\nin his countenance so much surprise as regret.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Henry said to him,--\r\n\r\n"Well, Marchdale, what think you of this new and extraordinary episode\r\nin our affairs?"\r\n\r\n"My dear young friends," said Marchdale, in a voice of great emotion, "I\r\nknow not what to say to you. I have no doubt but that you are both of\r\nyou much astonished at the receipt of these letters, and equally so at\r\nthe sudden absence of Charles Holland."\r\n\r\n"And are not you?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much as you, doubtless, are. The fact is, I never did entertain\r\na favourable opinion of the young man, and he knew it. I have been\r\naccustomed to the study of human nature under a variety of aspects; I\r\nhave made it a matter of deep, and I may add, sorrowful, contemplation,\r\nto study and remark those minor shades of character which commonly\r\nescape observation wholly. And, I repeat, I always had a bad opinion of\r\nCharles Holland, which he guessed, and hence he conceived a hatred to\r\nme, which more than once, as you cannot but remember, showed itself in\r\nlittle acts of opposition and hostility."\r\n\r\n"You much surprise me."\r\n\r\n"I expected to do so. But you cannot help remembering that at one time I\r\nwas on the point of leaving here solely on his account."\r\n\r\n"You were so."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I should have done so, but that I reasoned with myself upon the\r\nsubject, and subdued the impulse of the anger which some years ago, when\r\nI had not seen so much of the world, would have guided me."\r\n\r\n"But why did you not impart to us your suspicions? We should at least,\r\nthen, have been prepared for such a contingency as has occurred."\r\n\r\n"Place yourself in my position, and then yourself what you would have\r\ndone. Suspicion is one of those hideous things which all men should be\r\nmost specially careful not only how they entertain at all, but how they\r\ngive expression to. Besides, whatever may be the amount of one\'s own\r\ninternal conviction with regard to the character of any one, there is\r\njust a possibility that one may be wrong."\r\n\r\n"True, true."\r\n\r\n"That possibility ought to keep any one silent who has nothing but\r\nsuspicion to go upon, however cautious it may make him, as regards his\r\ndealings with the individual. I only suspected from little minute shades\r\nof character, that would peep out in spite of him, that Charles Holland\r\nwas not the honourable man he would fain have had everybody believe him\r\nto be."\r\n\r\n"And had you from the first such a feeling?"\r\n\r\n"I had."\r\n\r\n"It is very strange."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and what is more strange still, is that he from the first seemed\r\nto know it; and despite a caution which I could see he always kept\r\nuppermost in his thoughts, he could not help speaking tartly to me at\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\n"I have noticed that," said George.\r\n\r\n"You may depend it is a fact," added Marchdale, "that nothing so much\r\nexcites the deadly and desperate hatred of a man who is acting a\r\nhypocritical part, as the suspicion, well grounded or not, that another\r\nsees and understands the secret impulses of his dishonourable heart."\r\n\r\n"I cannot blame you, or any one else, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry, "that\r\nyou did not give utterance to your secret thoughts, but I do wish that\r\nyou had done so."\r\n\r\n"Nay, dear Henry," replied Mr. Marchdale, "believe me, I have made this\r\nmatter a subject of deep thought, and have abundance of reasons why I\r\nought not to have spoken to you upon the subject."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have, and not among the least important is the one, that if I\r\nhad acquainted you with my suspicions, you would have found yourself in\r\nthe painful position of acting a hypocritical part yourself towards this\r\nCharles Holland, for you must either have kept the secret that he was\r\nsuspected, or you must have shewn it to him by your behaviour."\r\n\r\n"Well, well. I dare say, Marchdale, you acted for the best. What shall\r\nwe do now?"\r\n\r\n"Can you doubt?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of letting Flora at once know the absolute and complete\r\nworthlessness of her lover, so that she could have no difficulty in at\r\nonce tearing herself from him by the assistance of the natural pride\r\nwhich would surely come to her aid, upon finding herself so much\r\ndeceived."\r\n\r\n"The test may be possible."\r\n\r\n"You think so?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Here is a letter, which of course remains unopened, addressed to Flora\r\nby Charles Holland. The admiral rather thought it would hurt her\r\nfeelings to deliver her such an epistle, but I must confess I am of a\r\ncontrary opinion upon that point, and think now the more evidence she\r\nhas of the utter worthlessness of him who professed to love her with so\r\nmuch disinterested affection, the better it will be for her."\r\n\r\n"You could not, possibly, Henry, have taken a more sensible view of the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you agree with me."\r\n\r\n"No reasonable man could do otherwise, and from what I have seen of\r\nAdmiral Bell, I am sure, upon reflection, he will be of the same\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\n"Then it shall be so. The first shock to poor Flora may be severe, but\r\nwe shall then have the consolation of knowing that it is the only one,\r\nand that in knowing the very worst, she has no more on that score to\r\napprehend. Alas, alas! the hand of misfortune now appears to have\r\npressed heavily upon us indeed. What in the name of all that is unlucky\r\nand disastrous, will happen next, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"What can happen?" said Marchdale; "I think you have now got rid of the\r\ngreatest evil of all--a false friend."\r\n\r\n"We have, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Go, then, to Flora; assure her that in the affection of others who know\r\nno falsehood, she will find a solace from every ill. Assure her that\r\nthere are hearts that will place themselves between her and every\r\nmisfortune."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale was much affected as he spoke. Probably he felt deeper\r\nthan he chose to express the misfortunes of that family for whom he\r\nentertained so much friendship. He turned aside his head to hide the\r\ntraces of emotion which, despite even his great powers of self-command,\r\nwould shew themselves upon his handsome and intelligent countenance.\r\nThen it appeared as if his noble indignation had got, for a few brief\r\nmoments, the better of all prudence, and he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"The villain! the worse than villain! who would, with a thousand\r\nartifices, make himself beloved by a young, unsuspecting, and beautiful\r\ngirl, but then to leave her to the bitterness of regret, that she had\r\never given such a man a place in her esteem. The heartless ruffian!"\r\n\r\n"Be calm, Mr. Marchdale, I pray you be calm," said George; "I never saw\r\nyou so much moved."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," he said, "excuse me; I am much moved, and I am human. I\r\ncannot always, let me strive my utmost, place a curb upon my feelings."\r\n\r\n"They are feelings which do you honour."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, I am foolish to have suffered myself to be led away into such\r\na hasty expression of them. I am accustomed to feel acutely and to feel\r\ndeeply, but it is seldom I am so much overcome as this."\r\n\r\n"Will you accompany us to the breakfast room at once, Mr. Marchdale,\r\nwhere we will make this communication to Flora; you will then be able to\r\njudge by her manner of receiving it, what it will be best to say to\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Come, then, and pray be calm. The least that is said upon this painful\r\nand harassing subject, after this morning, will be the best."\r\n\r\n"You are right--you are right."\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale hastily put on his coat. He was dressed, with the\r\nexception of that one article of apparel, when the brothers came to his\r\nchamber, and then he came to the breakfast-parlour where the painful\r\ncommunication was to be made to Flora of her lover\'s faithlessness.\r\n\r\nFlora was already seated in that apartment. Indeed, she had been\r\naccustomed to meet Charles Holland there before others of the family\r\nmade their appearance, but, alas! this morning the kind and tender lover\r\nwas not there.\r\n\r\nThe expression that sat upon the countenances of her brothers, and of\r\nMr. Marchdale, was quite sufficient to convince her that something more\r\nserious than usual had occurred, and she at the moment turned very pale.\r\nMarchdale observed this change of change of countenance in her, and he\r\nadvanced towards her, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, Flora, we have something to communicate to you, but it\r\nis a something which should excite indignation, and no other feeling, in\r\nyour breast."\r\n\r\n"Brother, what is the meaning of this?" said Flora, turning aside from\r\nMarchdale, and withdrawing the hand which he would have taken.\r\n\r\n"I would rather have Admiral Bell here before I say anything," said\r\nHenry, "regarding a matter in which he cannot but feel much interested\r\npersonally."\r\n\r\n"Here he is," said the admiral, who at that moment had opened the door\r\nof the breakfast room. "Here he is, so now fire away, and don\'t spare\r\nthe enemy."\r\n\r\n"And Charles?" said Flora, "where is Charles?"\r\n\r\n"D--n Charles!" cried the admiral, who had not been much accustomed to\r\ncontrol his feelings.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!" said Henry; "my dear sir, hush! do not indulge now in any\r\ninvectives. Flora, here are three letters; you will see that the one\r\nwhich is unopened is addressed to yourself. However, we wish you to read\r\nthe whole three of them, and then to form your own free and unbiased\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\nFlora looked as pale as a marble statue, when she took the letters into\r\nher hands. She let the two that were open fall on the table before her,\r\nwhile she eagerly broke the seal of that which was addressed to herself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHenry, with an instinctive delicacy, beckoned every one present to the\r\nwindow, so that Flora had not the pain of feeling that any eyes were\r\nfixed upon her but those of her mother, who had just come into the room,\r\nwhile she was perusing those documents which told such a tale of\r\nheartless dissimulation.\r\n\r\n"My dear child," said Mrs. Bannerworth, "you are ill."\r\n\r\n"Hush! mother--hush!" said Flora, "let me know all."\r\n\r\nShe read the whole of the letters through, and then, as the last one\r\ndropped from her grasp, she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, God! oh, God! what is all that has occurred compared to this?\r\nCharles--Charles--Charles!"\r\n\r\n"Flora!" exclaimed Henry, suddenly turning from the window. "Flora, is\r\nthis worthy of you?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven now support me!"\r\n\r\n"Is this worthy of the name you bear Flora? I should have thought, and I\r\ndid hope, that woman\'s pride would have supported you."\r\n\r\n"Let me implore you," added Marchdale, "to summon indignation to your\r\naid, Miss Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Charles--Charles--Charles!" she again exclaimed, as she wrung her hands\r\ndespairingly.\r\n\r\n"Flora, if anything could add a sting to my already irritated feelings,"\r\nsaid Henry, "this conduct of yours would."\r\n\r\n"Henry--brother, what mean you? Are you mad?"\r\n\r\n"Are you, Flora?"\r\n\r\n"God, I wish now that I was."\r\n\r\n"You have read those letters, and yet you call upon the name of him who\r\nwrote them with frantic tenderness."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," she cried; "frantic tenderness is the word. It is with\r\nfrantic tenderness I call upon his name, and ever will.--Charles!\r\nCharles!--dear Charles!"\r\n\r\n"This surpasses all belief," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"It is the frenzy of grief," added George; "but I did not expect it of\r\nher. Flora--Flora, think again."\r\n\r\n"Think--think--the rush of thought distracts. Whence came these\r\nletters?--where did you find these most disgraceful forgeries?"\r\n\r\n"Forgeries!" exclaimed Henry; and he staggered back, as if someone had\r\nstruck him a blow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, forgeries!" screamed Flora. "What has become of Charles Holland?\r\nHas he been murdered by some secret enemy, and then these most vile\r\nfabrications made up in his name? Oh, Charles, Charles, are you lost to\r\nme for ever?"\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said Henry; "I did not think of that"\r\n\r\n"Madness!--madness!" cried Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Hold!" shouted the admiral. "Let me speak to her."\r\n\r\nHe pushed every one aside, and advanced to Flora. He seized both her\r\nhands in his own, and in a tone of voice that was struggling with\r\nfeeling, he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Look at me, my dear; I\'m an old man old enough to be your grandfather,\r\nso you needn\'t mind looking me steadily in the face. Look at me, I want\r\nto ask you a question."\r\n\r\nFlora raised her beautiful eyes, and looked the old weather-beaten\r\nadmiral full in the face.\r\n\r\nOh! what a striking contrast did those two persons present to each\r\nother. That young and beautiful girl, with her small, delicate,\r\nchildlike hands clasped, and completely hidden in the huge ones of the\r\nold sailor, the white, smooth skin contrasting wonderfully with his\r\nwrinkled, hardened features.\r\n\r\n"My dear," he cried, "you have read those--those d----d letters, my\r\ndear?"\r\n\r\n"I have, sir."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of them?"\r\n\r\n"They were not written by Charles Holland, your nephew."\r\n\r\nA choking sensation seemed to come over the old man, and he tried to\r\nspeak, but in vain. He shook the hands of the young girl violently,\r\nuntil he saw that he was hurting her, and then, before she could be\r\naware of what he was about, he gave her a kiss on the cheek, as he\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n"God bless you--God bless you! You are the sweetest, dearest little\r\ncreature that ever was, or that ever will be, and I\'m a d----d old fool,\r\nthat\'s what I am. These letters were not written by my nephew, Charles.\r\nHe is incapable of writing them, and, d--n me, I shall take shame to\r\nmyself as long as I live for ever thinking so."\r\n\r\n"Dear sir," said Flora, who somehow or another did not seem at all\r\noffended at the kiss which the old man had given her; "dear sir, how\r\ncould you believe, for one moment, that they came from him? There has\r\nbeen some desperate villany on foot. Where is he?--oh, find him, if he\r\nbe yet alive. If they who have thus striven to steal from him that\r\nhonour, which is the jewel of his heart, have murdered him, seek them\r\nout, sir, in the sacred name of justice, I implore you."\r\n\r\n"I will--I will. I don\'t renounce him; he is my nephew still--Charles\r\nHolland--my own dear sister\'s son; and you are the best girl, God bless\r\nyou, that ever breathed. He loved you--he loves you still; and if he\'s\r\nabove ground, poor fellow, he shall yet tell you himself he never saw\r\nthose infamous letters."\r\n\r\n"You--you will seek for him?" sobbed Flora, and the tears gushed from\r\nher eyes. "Upon you, sir, who, as I do, feel assured of his innocence, I\r\nalone rely. If all the world say he is guilty, we will not think so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m d----d if we do."\r\n\r\nHenry had sat down by the table, and, with his hands clasped together,\r\nseemed in an agony of thought.\r\n\r\nHe was now roused by a thump on the back by the admiral, who cried,--\r\n\r\n"What do you think, now, old fellow? D--n it, things look a little\r\ndifferent now."\r\n\r\n"As God is my judge," said Henry, holding up his hands, "I know not what\r\nto think, but my heart and feelings all go with you and with Flora, in\r\nyour opinion of the innocence of Charles Holland."\r\n\r\n"I knew you would say that, because you could not possibly help it, my\r\ndear boy. Now we are all right again, and all we have got to do is to\r\nfind out which way the enemy has gone, and then give chase to him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marchdale, what do you think of this new suggestion," said George\r\nto that gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Pray, excuse me," was his reply; "I would much rather not be called\r\nupon to give an opinion."\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you mean by that?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Precisely what I say, sir."\r\n\r\n"D--n me, we had a fellow once in the combined fleets, who never had an\r\nopinion till after something had happened, and then he always said that\r\nwas just what he thought."\r\n\r\n"I was never in the combined, or any other fleet, sir," said Marchdale,\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n"Who the devil said you were?" roared the admiral.\r\n\r\nMarchdale merely hawed.\r\n\r\n"However," added the admiral, "I don\'t care, and never did, for\r\nanybody\'s opinion, when I know I am right. I\'d back this dear girl here\r\nfor opinions, and good feelings, and courage to express them, against\r\nall the world, I would, any day. If I was not the old hulk I am, I would\r\ntake a cruise in any latitude under the sun, if it was only for the\r\nchance of meeting with just such another."\r\n\r\n"Oh, lose no time!" said Flora. "If Charles is not to be found in the\r\nhouse, lose no time in searching for him, I pray you; seek him, wherever\r\nthere is the remotest probability he may chance to be. Do not let him\r\nthink he is deserted."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it," cried the admiral. "You make your mind easy, my dear.\r\nIf he\'s above ground, we shall find him out, you may depend upon it.\r\nCome along master Henry, you and I will consider what had best be done\r\nin this uncommonly ugly matter."\r\n\r\nHenry and George followed the admiral from the breakfast-room, leaving\r\nMarchdale there, who looked serious and full of melancholy thought.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that he considered Flora had spoken from the generous\r\nwarmth of her affection as regarded Charles Holland, and not from the\r\nconvictions which reason would have enforced her to feel.\r\n\r\nWhen he was now alone with her and Mrs. Bannerworth, he spoke in a\r\nfeeling and affectionate tone regarding the painful and inexplicable\r\nevents which had transpired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMR. MARCHDALE\'S EXCULPATION OF HIMSELF.--THE SEARCH THROUGH THE\r\nGARDENS.--THE SPOT OF THE DEADLY STRUGGLE.--THE MYSTERIOUS PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, very natural that, with her feelings towards Charles\r\nHolland, Flora should shrink from every one who seemed to be of a\r\ndirectly contrary impression, and when Mr. Marchdale now spoke, she\r\nshowed but little inclination to hear what he had to say in explanation.\r\n\r\nThe genuine and unaffected manner, however, in which he spoke, could not\r\nbut have its effect upon her, and she found herself compelled to listen,\r\nas well as, to a great extent, approve of the sentiments that fell from\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, "I beg that you will here, in the presence of your\r\nmother, give me a patient hearing. You fancy that, because I cannot join\r\nso glibly as the admiral in believing that these letters are forgeries,\r\nI must be your enemy."\r\n\r\n"Those letters," said Flora, "were not written by Charles Holland."\r\n\r\n"That is your opinion."\r\n\r\n"It is more than an opinion. He could not write them."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, of course, if I felt inclined, which Heaven alone knows I\r\ndo not, I could not hope successfully to argue against such a\r\nconviction. But I do not wish to do so. All I want to impress upon you\r\nis, that I am not to be blamed for doubting his innocence; and, at the\r\nsame time, I wish to assure you that no one in this house would feel\r\nmore exquisite satisfaction than I in seeing it established."\r\n\r\n"I thank you for so much," said Flora; "but as, to my mind, his\r\ninnocence has never been doubted, it needs to me no establishing."\r\n\r\n"Very good. You believe these letters forgeries?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"And that the disappearance of Charles Holland is enforced, and not of\r\nhis own free will?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Then you may rely upon my unremitting exertions night and day to find\r\nhim and any suggestion you can make, which is likely to aid in the\r\nsearch, shall, I pledge myself, be fully carried out."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, Mr. Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the mother, "rely on Mr. Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"I will rely on any one who believe Charles Holland innocent of writing\r\nthose odious letters, mother--I rely upon the admiral. He will aid me\r\nheart and hand."\r\n\r\n"And so will Mr. Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"And yet doubt it, Flora," said Marchdale, dejectedly. "I am very sorry\r\nthat such should be the case; I will not, however, trouble you any\r\nfurther, nor, give me leave to assure you, will I relax in my honest\r\nendeavours to clear up this mystery."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mr. Marchdale bowed, and left the room, apparently more vexed\r\nthan he cared to express at the misconstruction which had been put upon\r\nhis conduct and motives. He at once sought Henry and the admiral, to\r\nwhom he expressed his most earnest desire to aid in attempting to\r\nunravel the mysterious circumstances which had occurred.\r\n\r\n"This strongly-expressed opinion of Flora," he remarked, "is of course\r\namply sufficient to induce us to pause before we say one word more that\r\nshall in any way sound like a condemnation of Mr. Holland. Heaven forbid\r\nthat I should."\r\n\r\n"No," said the admiral; "don\'t."\r\n\r\n"I do not intend."\r\n\r\n"I would not advise anybody."\r\n\r\n"Sir, if you use that as a threat--"\r\n\r\n"A threat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I must say, it sounded marvellously like one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no--quite a mistake. I consider that every man has a fair\r\nright to the enjoyment of his opinion. All I have to remark is, that I\r\nshall, after what has occurred, feel myself called upon to fight anybody\r\nwho says those letters were written by my nephew."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed."\r\n\r\n"You will permit me to say such is a strange mode of allowing every one\r\nthe free enjoyment of his opinion."\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\n"Whatever pains and penalties may be the result, Admiral Bell, of\r\ndiffering with so infallible authority as yourself, I shall do so\r\nwhenever my judgment induces me."\r\n\r\n"You will?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will."\r\n\r\n"Very good. You know the consequences."\r\n\r\n"As to fighting you, I should refuse to do so."\r\n\r\n"Refuse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; most certainly."\r\n\r\n"Upon what ground?"\r\n\r\n"Upon the ground that you were a madman."\r\n\r\n"Come," now interposed Henry, "let me hope that, for my sake as well as\r\nfor Flora\'s, this dispute will proceed no further."\r\n\r\n"I have not courted it," said Marchdale. "I have much temper, but I am\r\nnot a stick or a stone."\r\n\r\n"D----e, if I don\'t think," said the admiral, "you are a bit of both."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Henry Bannerworth," said Marchdale, "I am your guest, and but for\r\nthe duty I feel in assisting in the search for Mr. Charles Holland, I\r\nshould at once leave your house."\r\n\r\n"You need not trouble yourself on my account," said the admiral; "if I\r\nfind no clue to him in the neighbourhood for two or three days, I shall\r\nbe off myself."\r\n\r\n"I am going," said Henry, rising, "to search the garden and adjoining\r\nmeadows; if you two gentlemen choose to come with me, I shall of course\r\nbe happy of your company; if, however, you prefer remaining here to\r\nwrangle, you can do so."\r\n\r\nThis had the effect, at all events, of putting a stop to the dispute for\r\nthe present, and both the admiral and Mr. Marchdale accompanied Henry on\r\nhis search. That search was commenced immediately under the balcony of\r\nCharles Holland\'s window, from which the admiral had seen him emerge.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing particular found there, or in the garden. Admiral Bell\r\npointed out accurately the route he had seen Charles take across the\r\ngrass plot just before he himself left his chamber to seek Henry.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this route was now taken, and it led to a low part of the\r\ngarden wall, which any one of ordinary vigour could easily have\r\nsurmounted.\r\n\r\n"My impression is," said the admiral, "that he got over here."\r\n\r\n"The ivy appears to be disturbed," remarked Henry.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we mark the spot, and then go round to it on the outer side?"\r\nsuggested George.\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to; for, although the young man might have chosen rather\r\nto clamber over the wall than go round, it was doubtful if the old\r\nadmiral could accomplish such a feat.\r\n\r\nThe distance round, however, was not great, and as they had cast over\r\nthe wall a handful of flowers from the garden to mark the precise spot,\r\nit was easily discoverable.\r\n\r\nThe moment they reached it, they were panic-stricken by the appearances\r\nwhich it presented. The grass was for some yards round about completely\r\ntrodden up, and converted into mud. There were deep indentations of\r\nfeet-marks in all directions, and such abundance of evidence that some\r\nmost desperate struggle had recently taken place there, that the most\r\nsceptical person in the world could not have entertained any doubt upon\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nHenry was the first to break the silence with which they each regarded\r\nthe broken ground.\r\n\r\n"This is conclusive to my mind," he said, with a deep sigh. "Here has\r\npoor Charles been attacked."\r\n\r\n"God keep him!" exclaimed Marchdale, "and pardon me my doubts--I am now\r\nconvinced."\r\n\r\nThe old admiral gazed about him like one distracted. Suddenly he cried--\r\n\r\n"They have murdered him. Some fiends in the shape of men have murdered\r\nhim, and Heaven only knows for what."\r\n\r\n"It seems but too probable," said Henry. "Let us endeavour to trace the\r\nfootsteps. Oh! Flora, Flora, what terrible news this will be to you."\r\n\r\n"A horrible supposition comes across my mind," said George. "What if he\r\nmet the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"It may have been so," said Marchdale, with a shudder. "It is a point\r\nwhich we should endeavour to ascertain, and I think we may do so."\r\n\r\n"How!"\r\n\r\n"By some inquiry as to whether Sir Francis Varney was from home at\r\nmidnight last night."\r\n\r\n"True; that might be done."\r\n\r\n"The question, suddenly put to one of his servants, would, most\r\nprobably, be answered as a thing of course."\r\n\r\n"It would."\r\n\r\n"Then that shall be decided upon. And now, my friends, since you have\r\nsome of you thought me luke-warm in this business, I pledge myself that,\r\nshould it be ascertained that Varney was from home at midnight last\r\nevening, I will defy him personally, and meet him hand to hand."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said Henry, "leave that course to younger hands."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"It more befits me to be his challenger."\r\n\r\n"No, Henry. You are differently situated to what I am."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Remember, that I am in the world a lone man; without ties or\r\nconnexions. If I lose my life, I compromise no one by my death; but you\r\nhave a mother and a bereaved sister to look to who will deserve your\r\ncare."\r\n\r\n"Hilloa," cried the admiral, "what\'s this?"\r\n\r\n"What?" cried each, eagerly, and they pressed forward to where the\r\nadmiral was stooping to the ground to pick up something which was nearly\r\ncompletely trodden into the grass.\r\n\r\nHe with some difficulty raised it. It was a small slip of paper, on\r\nwhich was some writing, but it was so much covered with mud as not to be\r\nlegible.\r\n\r\n"If this be washed," said Henry, "I think we shall be able to read it\r\nclearly."\r\n\r\n"We can soon try that experiment," said George. "And as the footsteps,\r\nby some mysterious means, show themselves nowhere else but in this one\r\nparticular spot, any further pursuit of inquiry about here appears\r\nuseless."\r\n\r\n"Then we will return to the house," said Henry, "and wash the mud from\r\nthis paper."\r\n\r\n"There is one important point," remarked Marchdale, "which it appears to\r\nme we have all overlooked."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What may that be?"\r\n\r\n"It is this. Is any one here sufficiently acquainted with the\r\nhandwriting of Mr. Charles Holland to come to an opinion upon the\r\nletters?"\r\n\r\n"I have some letters from him," said Henry, "which we received while on\r\nthe continent, and I dare say Flora has likewise."\r\n\r\n"Then they should be compared with the alleged forgeries."\r\n\r\n"I know his handwriting well," said the admiral. "The letters bear so\r\nstrong a resemblance to it that they would deceive anybody."\r\n\r\n"Then you may depend," remarked Henry, "some most deep-laid and\r\ndesperate plot is going on."\r\n\r\n"I begin," added Marchdale, "to dread that such must be the case. What\r\nsay you to claiming the assistance of the authorities, as well as\r\noffering a large reward for any information regarding Mr. Charles\r\nHolland?"\r\n\r\n"No plan shall be left untried, you may depend."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the house, and Henry having procured some clean\r\nwater, carefully washed the paper which had been found among the trodden\r\ngrass. When freed from the mixture of clay and mud which had obscured\r\nit, they made out the following words,--\r\n\r\n"--it be so well. At the next full moon seek a convenient spot, and it\r\ncan be done. The signature is, to my apprehension, perfect. The money\r\nwhich I hold, in my opinion, is much more in amount than you imagine,\r\nmust be ours; and as for--"\r\n\r\nHere the paper was torn across, and no further words were visible upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMystery seemed now to be accumulating upon mystery; each one, as it\r\nshowed itself darkly, seeming to bear some remote relation to what\r\npreceded it; and yet only confusing it the more.\r\n\r\nThat this apparent scrap of a letter had dropped from some one\'s pocket\r\nduring the fearful struggle, of which there were such ample evidences,\r\nwas extremely probable; but what it related to, by whom it was written,\r\nor by whom dropped, were unfathomable mysteries.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no one could give an opinion upon these matters at all; and\r\nafter a further series of conjectures, it could only be decided, that\r\nunimportant as the scrap of paper appeared now to be, it should be\r\npreserved, in case it should, as there was a dim possibility that it\r\nmight become a connecting link in some chain of evidence at another\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"And here we are," said Henry, "completely at fault, and knowing not\r\nwhat to do."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is a hard case," said the admiral, "that, with all the will in\r\nthe world to be up and doing something, we are lying here like a fleet\r\nof ships in a calm, as idle as possible."\r\n\r\n"You perceive we have no evidence to connect Sir Francis Varney with\r\nthis affair, either nearly or remotely," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," replied Henry.\r\n\r\n"But yet, I hope you will not lose sight of the suggestion I proposed,\r\nto the effect of ascertaining if he were from home last night."\r\n\r\n"But how is that to be carried out?"\r\n\r\n"Boldly."\r\n\r\n"How boldly?"\r\n\r\n"By going at once, I should advise, to his house, and asking the first\r\none of his domestics you may happen to see."\r\n\r\n"I will go over," cried George; "on such occasions as these one cannot\r\nact upon ceremony."\r\n\r\nHe seized his hat, and without waiting for a word from any one approving\r\nor condemning his going, off he went.\r\n\r\n"If," said Henry, "we find that Varney has nothing to do with the\r\nmatter, we are completely at fault."\r\n\r\n"Completely," echoed Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"In that case, admiral, I think we ought to defer to your feelings upon\r\nthe subject, and do whatever you suggest should be done."\r\n\r\n"I shall offer a hundred pounds reward to any one who can and will bring\r\nany news of Charles."\r\n\r\n"A hundred pounds is too much," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Not at all; and while I am about it, since the amount is made a subject\r\nof discussion, I shall make it two hundred, and that may benefit some\r\nrascal who is not so well paid for keeping the secret as I will pay him\r\nfor disclosing it."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are right," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"I know I am, as I always am."\r\n\r\nMarchdale could not forbear a smile at the opinionated old man, who\r\nthought no one\'s opinion upon any subject at all equal to his own; but\r\nhe made no remark, and only waited, as did Henry, with evident anxiety\r\nfor the return of George.\r\n\r\nThe distance was not great, and George certainly performed his errand\r\nquickly, for he was back in less time than they had thought he could\r\nreturn in. The moment he came into the room, he said, without waiting\r\nfor any inquiry to be made of him,--\r\n\r\n"We are at fault again. I am assured that Sir Francis Varney never\r\nstirred from home after eight o\'clock last evening."\r\n\r\n"D--n it, then," said the admiral, "let us give the devil his due. He\r\ncould not have had any hand in this business."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"From whom, George, did you get your information?" asked Henry, in a\r\ndesponding tone.\r\n\r\n"From, first of all, one of his servants, whom I met away from the\r\nhouse, and then from one whom I saw at the house."\r\n\r\n"There can be no mistake, then?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly none. The servants answered me at once, and so frankly that I\r\ncannot doubt it."\r\n\r\nThe door of the room was slowly opened, and Flora came in. She looked\r\nalmost the shadow of what she had been but a few weeks before. She was\r\nbeautiful, but she almost realised the poet\'s description of one who had\r\nsuffered much, and was sinking into an early grave, the victim of a\r\nbroken heart:--\r\n\r\n      "She was more beautiful than death,\r\n      And yet as sad to look upon."\r\n\r\nHer face was of a marble paleness, and as she clasped her hands, and\r\nglanced from face to face, to see if she could gather hope and\r\nconsolation from the expression of any one, she might have been taken\r\nfor some exquisite statue of despair.\r\n\r\n"Have you found him?" she said. "Have you found Charles?"\r\n\r\n"Flora, Flora," said Henry, as he approached her.\r\n\r\n"Nay, answer me; have you found him? You went to seek him. Dead or\r\nalive, have you found him?"\r\n\r\n"We have not, Flora."\r\n\r\n"Then I must seek him myself. None will search for him as I will search;\r\nI must myself seek him. \'Tis true affection that can alone be successful\r\nin such a search."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, dear Flora, that all has been done which the shortness of\r\nthe time that has elapsed would permit. Further measures will now\r\nimmediately be taken. Rest assured, dear sister, that all will be done\r\nthat the utmost zeal can suggest."\r\n\r\n"They have killed him! they have killed him!" she said, mournfully. "Oh,\r\nGod, they have killed him! I am not now mad, but the time will come when\r\nI must surely be maddened. The vampyre has killed Charles Holland--the\r\ndreadful vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, now, Flora, this is frenzy."\r\n\r\n"Because he loved me has he been destroyed. I know it, I know it. The\r\nvampyre has doomed me to destruction. I am lost, and all who loved me\r\nwill be involved in one common ruin on my account. Leave me all of you\r\nto perish. If, for iniquities done in our family, some one must suffer\r\nto appease the divine vengeance, let that one be me, and only me."\r\n\r\n"Hush, sister, hush!" cried Henry. "I expected not this from you. The\r\nexpressions you use are not your expressions. I know you better. There\r\nis abundance of divine mercy, but no divine vengeance. Be calm, I pray\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Calm! calm!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Make an exertion of that intellect we all know you to possess. It\r\nis too common a thing with human nature, when misfortune overtakes it,\r\nto imagine that such a state of things is specially arranged. We quarrel\r\nwith Providence because it does not interfere with some special miracle\r\nin our favour; forgetting that, being denizens of this earth, and\r\nmembers of a great social system; We must be subject occasionally to the\r\naccidents which will disturb its efficient working."\r\n\r\n"Oh, brother, brother!" she exclaimed, as she dropped into a seat, "you\r\nhave never loved."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"No; you have never felt what it was to hold your being upon the breath\r\nof another. You can reason calmly, because you cannot know the extent of\r\nfeeling you are vainly endeavouring to combat."\r\n\r\n"Flora, you do me less than justice. All I wish to impress upon your\r\nmind is, that you are not in any way picked out by Providence to be\r\nspecially unhappy--that there is no perversion of nature on your\r\naccount."\r\n\r\n"Call you that hideous vampyre form that haunts me no perversion of\r\nordinary nature?"\r\n\r\n"What is is natural," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Cold reasoning to one who suffers as I suffer. I cannot argue with you;\r\nI can only know that I am most unhappy--most miserable."\r\n\r\n"But that will pass away, sister, and the sun of your happiness may\r\nsmile again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I could but hope!"\r\n\r\n"And wherefore should you deprive yourself of that poorest privilege of\r\nthe most unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Because my heart tells me to despair."\r\n\r\n"Tell it you won\'t, then," cried Admiral Bell. "If you had been at sea\r\nas long as I have, Miss Bannerworth, you would never despair of anything\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"Providence guarded you," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s true enough, I dare say, I was in a storm once off Cape\r\nUshant, and it was only through Providence, and cutting away the\r\nmainmast myself, that we succeeded in getting into port."\r\n\r\n"You have one hope," said Marchdale to Flora, as he looked in her wan\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"One hope?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Recollect you have one hope."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"You think that, by removing from this place, you may find that peace\r\nwhich is here denied you."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no."\r\n\r\n"Indeed. I thought that such was your firm conviction."\r\n\r\n"It was; but circumstances have altered."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Charles Holland has disappeared here, and here must I remain to seek\r\nfor him."\r\n\r\n"True he may have disappeared here," remarked Marchdale; "and yet that\r\nmay be no argument for supposing him still here."\r\n\r\n"Where, then, is he?"\r\n\r\n"God knows how rejoiced I should be if I were able to answer your\r\nquestion. I must seek him, dead or alive! I must see him yet before I\r\nbid adieu to this world, which has now lost all its charms for me."\r\n\r\n"Do not despair," said Henry; "I will go to the town now at once, to\r\nmake known our suspicions that he has met with some foul play. I will\r\nset every means in operation that I possibly can to discover him. Mr.\r\nChillingworth will aid me, too; and I hope that not many days will\r\nelapse, Flora, before some intelligence of a most satisfactory nature\r\nshall be brought to you on Charles Holland\'s account."\r\n\r\n"Go, go, brother; go at once."\r\n\r\n"I go now at once."\r\n\r\n"Shall I accompany you?" said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"No. Remain here to keep watch over Flora\'s safety while I am gone; I\r\ncan alone do all that can be done."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t forget to offer the two hundred pounds reward," said the\r\nadmiral, "to any one who can bring us news of Charles, on which we can\r\nrely."\r\n\r\n"I will not."\r\n\r\n"Surely--surely something must result from that," said Flora, as she\r\nlooked in the admiral\'s face, as if to gather encouragement in her\r\ndawning hopes from its expression.\r\n\r\n"Of course it will, my dear," he said. "Don\'t you be downhearted; you\r\nand I are of one mind in this affair, and of one mind we will keep. We\r\nwon\'t give up our opinions for anybody."\r\n\r\n"Our opinions," she said, "of the honour and honesty of Charles Holland.\r\nThat is what we will adhere to."\r\n\r\n"Of course we will."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir, it joys me, even in the midst of this, my affliction, to find\r\none at least who is determined to do him full justice. We cannot find\r\nsuch contradictions in nature as that a mind, full of noble impulses,\r\nshould stoop to such a sudden act of selfishness as those letters would\r\nattribute to Charles Holland. It cannot--cannot be."\r\n\r\n"You are right, my dear. And now, Master Henry, you be off, will you, if\r\nyou please."\r\n\r\n"I am off now. Farewell, Flora, for a brief space."\r\n\r\n"Farewell, brother; and Heaven speed you on your errand."\r\n\r\n"Amen to that," cried the admiral; "and now, my dear, if you have got\r\nhalf an hour to spare, just tuck your arm under mine, and take a walk\r\nwith me in the garden, for I want to say something to you."\r\n\r\n"Most willingly," said Flora.\r\n\r\n"I would not advise you to stray far from the house, Miss Bannerworth,"\r\nsaid Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Nobody asked you for advice," said the admiral. "D----e, do you want to\r\nmake out that I ain\'t capable of taking care of her?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; but--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense! Come along, my dear; and if all the vampyres and odd fish\r\nthat were ever created were to come across our path, we would settle\r\nthem somehow or another. Come along, and don\'t listen to anybody\'s\r\ncroaking."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA PEEP THROUGH AN IRON GRATING.--THE LONELY PRISONER IN HIS\r\nDUNGEON.--THE MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithout forestalling the interest of our story, or recording a fact in\r\nits wrong place, we now call our readers\' attention to a circumstance\r\nwhich may, at all events, afford some food for conjecture.\r\n\r\nSome distance from the Hall, which, from time immemorial, had been the\r\nhome and the property of the Bannerworth family, was an ancient ruin\r\nknown by the name of the Monks\' Hall.\r\n\r\nIt was conjectured that this ruin was the remains of some one of those\r\nhalf monastic, half military buildings which, during the middle ages,\r\nwere so common in almost every commanding situation in every county of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt a period of history when the church arrogated to itself an amount of\r\npolitical power which the intelligence of the spirit of the age now\r\ndenies to it, and when its members were quite ready to assert at any\r\ntime the truth of their doctrines by the strong arm of power, such\r\nbuildings as the one, the old grey ruins of which were situated near to\r\nBannerworth Hall, were erected.\r\n\r\nOstensibly for religious purposes, but really as a stronghold for\r\ndefence, as well as for aggression, this Monks\' Hall, as it was called,\r\npartook quite as much of the character of a fortress, as of an\r\necclesiastical building.\r\n\r\nThe ruins covered a considerable extent, of ground, but the only part\r\nwhich seemed successfully to have resisted the encroaches of time, at\r\nleast to a considerable extent, was a long, hall in which the jolly\r\nmonks no doubt feasted and caroused.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this hall, were the walls of other parts of the building,\r\nand at several places there were small, low, mysterious-looking doors\r\nthat led, heaven knows where, into some intricacies and labyrinths\r\nbeneath the building, which no one had, within the memory of man, been\r\ncontent to run the risk of losing himself in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was related that among these subterranean passages and arches there\r\nwere pitfalls and pools of water; and whether such a statement was true\r\nor not, it certainly acted as a considerable damper upon the vigour of\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThis ruin was so well known in the neighbourhood, and had become from\r\nearliest childhood so familiar to the inhabitants of Bannerworth Hall,\r\nthat one would as soon expect an old inhabitant of Ludgate-hill to make\r\nsome remark about St. Paul\'s, as any of them to allude to the ruins of\r\nMonks\' Hall.\r\n\r\nThey never now thought of going near to it, for in infancy they had\r\nspoiled among its ruins, and it had become one of those familiar objects\r\nwhich, almost, from that very familiarity, cease to hold a place in the\r\nmemories of those who know it so well.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to this ruin we would now conduct our readers, premising\r\nthat what we have to say concerning it now, is not precisely in the form\r\nof a connected portion of our narrative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is evening--the evening of that first day of heart loneliness to poor\r\nFlora Bannerworth. The lingering rays of the setting sun are gilding the\r\nold ruins with a wondrous beauty. The edges of the decayed stones seem\r\nnow to be tipped with gold, and as the rich golden refulgence of light\r\ngleams upon the painted glass which still adorned a large window of the\r\nhall, a flood of many-coloured beautiful light was cast within, making\r\nthe old flag-stones, with which the interior was paved, look more like\r\nsome rich tapestry, laid down to do honour to a monarch.\r\n\r\nSo picturesque and so beautiful an aspect did the ancient ruin wear,\r\nthat to one with a soul to appreciate the romantic and the beautiful, it\r\nwould have amply repaid the fatigue of a long journey now to see it.\r\n\r\nAnd as the sun sank to rest, the gorgeous colours that it cast upon the\r\nmouldering wall, deepened from an appearance of burnished gold to a\r\ncrimson hue, and from that again the colour changed to a shifting\r\npurple, mingling with the shadows of the evening, and so gradually\r\nfading away into absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nThe place is as silent as the tomb--a silence far more solemn than could\r\nhave existed, had there been no remains of a human habitation; because\r\neven these time-worn walls were suggestive of what once had been; and\r\nthe wrapt stillness which now pervaded them brought with them a\r\nmelancholy feeling for the past.\r\n\r\nThere was not even the low hum of insect life to break the stillness of\r\nthese ancient ruins.\r\n\r\nAnd now the last rays of the sun are gradually fading away. In a short\r\ntime all will be darkness. A low gentle wind is getting up, and\r\nbeginning slightly to stir the tall blades of grass that have shot up\r\nbetween some of the old stones. The silence is broken, awfully broken,\r\nby a sudden cry of despair; such a cry as might come from some\r\nimprisoned spirit, doomed to waste an age of horror in a tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was scarcely to be called a scream, and not all a groan. It\r\nmight have come from some one on the moment of some dreadful sacrifice,\r\nwhen the judgment had not sufficient time to call courage to its aid,\r\nbut involuntarily had induced that sound which might not be repeated.\r\n\r\nA few startled birds flew from odd holes and corners about the ruins, to\r\nseek some other place of rest. The owl hooted from a corner of what had\r\nonce been a belfry, and a dreamy-looking bat flew out from a cranny and\r\nstruck itself headlong against a projection.\r\n\r\nThen all was still again. Silence resumed its reign, and if there had\r\nbeen a mortal ear to drink in that sudden sound, the mind might well\r\nhave doubted if fancy had not more to do with the matter than reality.\r\n\r\nFrom out a portion of the ruins that was enveloped in the deepest gloom,\r\nthere now glides a figure. It is of gigantic height, and it moves along\r\nwith a slow and measured tread. An ample mantle envelopes the form,\r\nwhich might well have been taken for the spirit of one of the monks who,\r\ncenturies since, had made that place their home.\r\n\r\nIt walked the whole length of the ample hall we have alluded to, and\r\nthen, at the window from which had streamed the long flood of many\r\ncoloured light, it paused.\r\n\r\nFor more than ten minutes this mysterious looking figure there stood.\r\n\r\nAt length there passed something on the outside of the window, that\r\nlooked like the shadow of a human form.\r\n\r\nThen the tall, mysterious, apparition-looking man turned, and sought a\r\nside entrance to the hall.\r\n\r\nThen he paused, and, in about a minute, he was joined by another who\r\nmust have been he who had so recently passed the stained glass window on\r\nthe outer side.\r\n\r\nThere was a friendly salutation between these two beings, and they\r\nwalked to the centre of the hall, where they remained for some time in\r\nanimated conversation.\r\n\r\nFrom the gestures they used, it was evident that the subject of their\r\ndiscourse was one of deep and absorbing interest to both. It was one,\r\ntoo, upon which, after a time, they seemed a little to differ, and more\r\nthan once they each assumed attitudes of mutual defiance.\r\n\r\nThis continued until the sun had so completely sunk, that twilight was\r\nbeginning sensibly to wane, and then gradually the two men appeared to\r\nhave come to a better understanding, and whatever might be the subject\r\nof their discourse, there was some positive result evidently arrived at\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThey spoke in lower tones. They used less animated gestures than before;\r\nand, after a time, they both walked slowly down the hull towards the\r\ndark spot from whence the first tall figure had so mysteriously emerged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere it a dungeon--damp and full of the most unwholesome\r\nexhalations--deep under ground it seems, and, in its excavations, it\r\nwould appear as if some small land springs had been liberated, for the\r\nearthen floor was one continued extent of moisture.\r\n\r\nFrom the roof, too, came perpetually the dripping of water, which fell\r\nwith sullen, startling splashes in the pool below.\r\n\r\nAt one end, and near to the roof,--so near that to reach it, without the\r\nmost efficient means from the inside, was a matter of positive\r\nimpossibility--is a small iron grating, and not much larger than might\r\nbe entirely obscured by any human face that might be close to it from\r\nthe outside of the dungeon.\r\n\r\nThat dreadful abode is tenanted. In one corner, on a heap of straw,\r\nwhich appears freshly to have been cast into the place, lies a hopeless\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nIt is no great stretch of fancy to suppose, that it is from his lips\r\ncame the sound of terror and of woe that had disturbed the repose of\r\nthat lonely spot.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner is lying on his back; a rude bandage round his head, on\r\nwhich were numerous spots of blood, would seem to indicate that he had\r\nsuffered personal injury in some recent struggle. His eyes were open.\r\nThey were fixed desparingly, perhaps unconsciously, upon that small\r\ngrating which looked into the upper world.\r\n\r\nThat grating slants upwards, and looks to the west, so that any one\r\nconfined in that dreary dungeon might be tantalized, on a sweet summer\'s\r\nday, by seeing the sweet blue sky, and occasionally the white clouds\r\nflitting by in that freedom which he cannot hope for.\r\n\r\nThe carol of a bird, too, might reach him there. Alas! sad remembrance\r\nof life, and joy, and liberty.\r\n\r\nBut now all is deepening gloom. The prisoner sees nothing--hears\r\nnothing; and the sky is not quite dark. That small grating looks like a\r\nstrange light-patch in the dungeon wall.\r\n\r\nHark! some footstep sounds upon his ear. The creaking of a door\r\nfollows--a gleam of light shines into the dungeon, and the tall\r\nmysterious-looking figure in the cloak stands before the occupant of\r\nthat wretched place.\r\n\r\nThen comes in the other man, and he carries in his hand writing\r\nmaterials. He stoops to the stone couch on which the prisoner lies, and\r\noffers him a pen, as he raises him partially from the miserable damp\r\npallet.\r\n\r\nBut there is no speculation in the eyes of that oppressed man. In vain\r\nthe pen is repeatedly placed in his grasp, and a document of some\r\nlength, written on parchment, spread out before him to sign. In vain is\r\nhe held up now by both the men, who have thus mysteriously sought him in\r\nhis dungeon; he has not power to do as they would wish him. The pen\r\nfalls from his nerveless grasp, and, with a deep sigh, when they cease\r\nto hold him up, he falls heavily back upon the stone couch.\r\n\r\nThen the two men looked at each other for about a minute silently; after\r\nwhich he who was the shorter of the two raised one hand, and, in a voice\r\nof such concentrated hatred and passion as was horrible to hear, he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"D--n!"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the other was a laugh; and then he took the light from the\r\nfloor, and motioned the one who seemed so little able to control his\r\nfeelings of bitterness and disappointment to leave the place with him.\r\n\r\nWith a haste and vehemence, then, which showed how much angered he was,\r\nthe shorter man of the two now rolled up the parchment, and placed it in\r\na breast-pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\nHe cast a withering look of intense hatred on the form of the\r\nnearly-unconscious prisoner, and then prepared to follow the other.\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the door of the dungeon, the taller man of the two\r\npaused, and appeared for a moment or two to be in deep thought; after\r\nwhich he handed the lamp he carried to his companion, and approached the\r\npallet of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket a small bottle, and, raising the head of the\r\nfeeble and wounded man, he poured some portion of the contents into his\r\nmouth, and watched him swallow it.\r\n\r\nThe other looked on in silence, and then they both slowly left the\r\ndreary dungeon.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe wind rose, and the night had deepened into the utmost darkness. The\r\nblackness of a night, unillumined by the moon, which would not now rise\r\nfor some hours, was upon the ancient ruins. All was calm and still, and\r\nno one would have supposed that aught human was within those ancient,\r\ndreary looking walls.\r\n\r\nTime will show who it was who lay in that unwholesome dungeon, as well\r\nas who were they who visited him so mysteriously, and retired again with\r\nfeelings of such evident disappointment with the document it seemed of\r\nsuch importance, at least to one of them, to get that unconscious man to\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT OF FLORA TO THE VAMPYRE.--THE OFFER.--THE SOLEMN ASSEVERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell had, of course, nothing particular to communicate to Flora\r\nin the walk he induced her to take with him in the gardens of\r\nBannerworth Hall, but he could talk to her upon a subject which was sure\r\nto be a welcome one, namely, of Charles Holland.\r\n\r\nAnd not only could he talk to her of Charles, but he was willing to talk\r\nof him in the style of enthusiastic commendation which assimilated best\r\nwith her own feelings. No one but the honest old admiral, who was as\r\nviolent in his likes and his dislikes as any one could possibly be,\r\ncould just then have conversed with Flora Bannerworth to her\r\nsatisfaction of Charles Holland.\r\n\r\nHe expressed no doubts whatever concerning Charles\'s faith, and to his\r\nmind, now that he had got that opinion firmly fixed in his mind,\r\neverybody that held a contrary one he at once denounced as a fool or a\r\nrogue.\r\n\r\n"Never you mind, Miss Flora," he said; "you will find, I dare say, that\r\nall will come right eventually. D--n me! the only thing that provokes me\r\nin the whole business is, that I should have been such an old fool as\r\nfor a moment to doubt Charles."\r\n\r\n"You should have known him better, sir."\r\n\r\n"I should, my dear, but I was taken by surprise, you see, and that was\r\nwrong, too, for a man who has held a responsible command."\r\n\r\n"But the circumstances, dear sir, were of a nature to take every one by\r\nsurprise."\r\n\r\n"They were, they were. But now, candidly speaking, and I know I can\r\nspeak candidly to you; do you really think this Varney is the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"You do? Well, then, somebody must tackle him, that\'s quite clear; we\r\ncan\'t put up with his fancies always."\r\n\r\n"What can be done?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that I don\'t know, but something must be done, you know. He wants\r\nthis place; Heaven only knows why or wherefore he has taken such a fancy\r\nto it; but he has done so, that is quite clear. If it had a good sea\r\nview, I should not be so much surprised; but there\'s nothing of the\r\nsort, so it\'s no way at all better than any other shore-going stupid\r\nsort of house, that you can see nothing but land from."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if my brother would but make some compromise with him to restore\r\nCharles to us and take the house, we might yet be happy."\r\n\r\n"D--n it! then you still think that he has a hand in spiriting away\r\nCharles?"\r\n\r\n"Who else could do so?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if I know. I do feel tolerably sure, and I have good\r\ndeal of reliance upon your opinion, my dear; I say, I do feel tolerably\r\nsure: but, if I was d----d sure, now, I\'d soon have it out of him."\r\n\r\n"For my sake, Admiral Bell, I wish now to extract one promise from you."\r\n\r\n"Say your say, my dear, and I\'ll promise you."\r\n\r\n"You will not then expose yourself to the danger of any personal\r\nconflict with that most dreadful man, whose powers of mischief we do not\r\nknow, and therefore cannot well meet or appreciate."\r\n\r\n"Whew! is that what you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you will, I am sure, promise me so much."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear, you see the case is this. In affairs of fighting, the\r\nless ladies interfere the better."\r\n\r\n"Nay, why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because--because, you see, a lady has no reputation for courage to keep\r\nup. Indeed, it\'s rather the other way, for we dislike a bold woman as\r\nmuch as we hold in contempt a cowardly man."\r\n\r\n"But if you grant to us females that in consequence of our affections,\r\nwe are not courageous, you must likewise grant how much we are doomed to\r\nsuffer from the dangers of those whom we esteem."\r\n\r\n"You would be the last person in the world to esteem a coward."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. But there is more true courage often in not fighting than in\r\nentering into a contest."\r\n\r\n"You are right enough there, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Under ordinary circumstances, I should not oppose your carrying out the\r\ndictates of your honour, but now, let me entreat you not to meet this\r\ndreadful man, if man he can be called, when you know not how unfair the\r\ncontest may be."\r\n\r\n"Unfair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. May he not have some means of preventing you from injuring him,\r\nand of overcoming you, which no mortal possesses?"\r\n\r\n"He may."\r\n\r\n"Then the supposition of such a case ought to be sufficient ground for\r\nat once inducing you to abandon all idea of meeting with him."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I\'ll consider of this matter."\r\n\r\n"Do so."\r\n\r\n"There is another thing, however, which now you will permit me to ask of\r\nyou as a favour."\r\n\r\n"It is granted ere it is spoken."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Now you must not be offended with what I am going to say,\r\nbecause, however it may touch that very proper pride which you, and such\r\nas you, are always sure to possess, you are fortunately at all times\r\nable to call sufficient judgment to your aid to enable you to see what\r\nis really offensive and what is not."\r\n\r\n"You alarm me by such a preface."\r\n\r\n"Do I? then here goes at once. Your brother Henry, poor fellow, has\r\nenough to do, has he not, to make all ends meet."\r\n\r\nA flush of excitement came over Flora\'s cheek as the old admiral thus\r\nbluntly broached a subject of which she already knew the bitterness to\r\nsuch a spirit as her brother\'s.\r\n\r\n"You are silent," continued the old man; "by that I guess I am not wrong\r\nin my I supposition; indeed it is hardly a supposition at all, for\r\nMaster Charles told me as much, and no doubt he had it from a correct\r\nquarter."\r\n\r\n"I cannot deny it, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t. It ain\'t worth denying, my dear. Poverty is no crime, but,\r\nlike being born a Frenchman, it\'s a d----d misfortune."\r\n\r\nFlora could scarcely refuse a smile, as the nationality of the old\r\nadmiral peeped out even in the midst of his most liberal and best\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n"Well," he continued, "I don\'t intend that he shall have so much trouble\r\nas he has had. The enemies of his king and his country shall free him\r\nfrom his embarrassments."\r\n\r\n"The enemies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; who else?"\r\n\r\n"You speak in riddles, sir."\r\n\r\n"Do I? Then I\'ll soon make the riddles plain. When I went to sea I was\r\nworth nothing--as poor as a ship\'s cat after the crew had been paid off\r\nfor a month. Well, I began fighting away as hard and fast as I could,\r\nand the more I fought, and the more hard knocks I gave and took, the\r\nmore money I got."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes; prize after prize we hauled into port, and at last the French\r\nvessels wouldn\'t come out of their harbours."\r\n\r\n"What did you do then?"\r\n\r\n"What did we do then? Why what was the most natural thing in the whole\r\nworld for us to do, we did."\r\n\r\n"I cannot guess."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am surprised at that. Try again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I can guess now. How could I have been so dull? You went and\r\ntook them out."\r\n\r\n"To be sure we did--to be sure we did, my dear; that\'s how we managed\r\nthem. And, do you see, at the end of the war I found myself with lots of\r\nprize money, all wrung from old England\'s enemies, and I intend that\r\nsome of it shall find it\'s way to your brother\'s pocket; and you see\r\nthat will bear out just what I said, that the enemies of his king and\r\nhis country shall free him from his difficulties--don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"I see your noble generosity, admiral."\r\n\r\n"Noble fiddlestick! Now I have mentioned this matter to you, my dear,\r\nand I don\'t so much mind talking to you about such matters as I should\r\nto your brother, I want you to do me the favour of managing it all for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"How, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Why, just this way. You must find out how much money will free your\r\nbrother just now from a parcel of botherations that beset him, and then\r\nI will give it to you, and you can hand it to him, you see, so I need\r\nnot say anything about it; and if he speaks to me on the subject at all,\r\nI can put him down at once by saying, \'avast there, it\'s no business of\r\nmine.\'"\r\n\r\n"And can you, dear admiral, imagine that I could conceal the generous\r\nsource from where so much assistance came?"\r\n\r\n"Of course; it will come from you. I take a fancy to make you a present\r\nof a sum of money; you do with it what you please--it\'s yours, and I\r\nhave no right and no inclination to ask you what use you put it to."\r\n\r\nTears gushed from the eyes of Flora as she tried to utter some word, but\r\ncould not. The admiral swore rather fearfully, and pretended to wonder\r\nmuch what on earth she could be crying for. At length, after the first\r\ngush of feeling was over, she said,--\r\n\r\n"I cannot accept of so much generosity, sir--I dare not"\r\n\r\n"Dare not!"\r\n\r\n"No; I should think meanly of myself were I to take advantage of the\r\nboundless munificence of your nature."\r\n\r\n"Take advantage! I should like to see anybody take advantage of me,\r\nthat\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I ought not to take the money of you. I will speak to my brother, and\r\nwell I know how much he will appreciate the noble, generous offer, my\r\ndear sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, settle it your own way, only remember I have a right to do what I\r\nlike with my own money."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Then as that is undoubted, whatever I lend to him, mind I\r\ngive to you, so it\'s as broad as it\'s long, as the Dutchman said, when\r\nhe looked at the new ship that was built for him, and you may as well\r\ntake it yourself you see, and make no more fuss about it."\r\n\r\n"I will consider," said Flora, with much emotion--"between this time and\r\nthe same hour to-morrow I will consider, sir, and if you can find any\r\nwords more expressive of heartfelt gratitude than others, pray imagine\r\nthat I have used them with reference to my own feelings towards you for\r\nsuch an unexampled offer of friendship."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother--stuff."\r\n\r\nThe admiral now at once changed the subject, and began to talk of\r\nCharles--a most grateful theme to Flora, as may well be supposed. He\r\nrelated to her many little particulars connected with him which all\r\ntended to place his character in a most amiable light, and as her ears\r\ndrank in the words of commendation of him she loved, what sweeter music\r\ncould there be to her than the voice of that old weather-beaten\r\nrough-spoken man.\r\n\r\n"The idea," he added, to a warm eulogium he had uttered concerning\r\nCharles--"the idea that he could write those letters my dear, is quite\r\nabsurd."\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed. Oh, that we could know what had become of him!"\r\n\r\n"We shall know. I don\'t think but what he\'s alive. Something seems to\r\nassure me that we shall some of these days look upon his face again."\r\n\r\n"I am rejoiced to hear you say so."\r\n\r\n"We will stir heaven and earth to find him. If he were killed, do you\r\nsee, there would have been some traces of him now at hand; besides, he\r\nwould have been left lying where the rascals attacked him."\r\n\r\nFlora shuddered.\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you fret yourself. You may depend that the sweet little\r\ncherub that sits up aloft has looked after him."\r\n\r\n"I will hope so."\r\n\r\n"And now, my dear, Master Henry will soon be home, I am thinking, and as\r\nhe has quite enough disagreeables on his own mind to be able to spare a\r\nfew of them, you will take the earliest opportunity, I am sure, of\r\nacquainting him with the little matter we have been talking about, and\r\nlet me know what he says."\r\n\r\n"I will--I will."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Now, go in doors, for there\'s a cold air blowing here,\r\nand you are a delicate plant rather just now--go in and make yourself\r\ncomfortable and easy. The worst storm must blow over at last."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nSIR FRANCIS VARNEY AND HIS MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.--THE STRANGE CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney is in what he calls his own apartment. It is night,\r\nand a dim and uncertain light from a candle which has been long\r\nneglected, only serves to render obscurity more perplexing. The room is\r\na costly one. One replete with all the appliances of refinement and\r\nluxury which the spirit and the genius of the age could possibly supply\r\nhim with, but there is upon his brow the marks of corroding care, and\r\nlittle does that most mysterious being seem to care for all the rich\r\nfurnishing of that apartment in which he sits.\r\n\r\nHis cadaverous-looking face is even paler and more death-like-looking\r\nthan usual; and, if it can be conceived possible that such an one can\r\nfeel largely interested in human affairs, to look at him, we could well\r\nsuppose that some interest of no common magnitude was at stake.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, too, he muttered some unconnected words, no doubt mentally\r\nfilling up the gaps, which rendered the sentences incomplete, and being\r\nunconscious, perhaps, that he was giving audible utterance to any of his\r\ndark and secret meditations.\r\n\r\nAt length he rose, and with an anxious expression of countenance, he\r\nwent to the window, and looked out into the darkness of the night. All\r\nwas still, and not an object was visible. It was that pitchy darkness\r\nwithout, which, for some hours, when the moon is late in lending her\r\nreflected beams, comes over the earth\'s surface.\r\n\r\n"It is near the hour," he muttered. "It is now very near the hour;\r\nsurely he will come, and yet I know not why I should fear him, although\r\nI seem to tremble at the thought of his approach. He will surely come.\r\nOnce a year--only once does he visit me, and then \'tis but to take the\r\nprice which he has compelled me to pay for that existence, which but for\r\nhim had been long since terminated. Sometimes I devoutly wish it were."\r\n\r\nWith a shudder he returned to the seat he had so recently left, and\r\nthere for some time he appeared to meditate in silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly now, a clock, which was in the hall of that mansion he had\r\npurchased, sounded the hour loudly.\r\n\r\n"The time has come," said Sir Francis. "The time has come. He will\r\nsurely soon be here. Hark! hark!"\r\n\r\nSlowly and distinctly he counted the strokes of the clock, and, when\r\nthey had ceased, he exclaimed, with sudden surprise--\r\n\r\n"Eleven! But eleven! How have I been deceived. I thought the hour of\r\nmidnight was at hand."\r\n\r\nHe hastily consulted the watch he wore, and then he indeed found, that\r\nwhatever he had been looking forward to with dread for some time past,\r\nas certain to ensue, at or about twelve o clock, had yet another hour in\r\nwhich to prey upon his imagination.\r\n\r\n"How could I have made so grievous an error?" he exclaimed. "Another\r\nhour of suspense and wonder as to whether that man be among the living\r\nor the dead. I have thought of raising my hand against his life, but\r\nsome strange mysterious feeling has always staid me; and I have let him\r\ncome and go freely, while an opportunity might well have served me to\r\nput such a design into execution. He is old, too--very old, and yet he\r\nkeeps death at a distance. He looked pale, but far from unwell or\r\nfailing, when last I saw him. Alas! a whole hour yet to wait. I would\r\nthat this interview were over."\r\n\r\nThat extremely well known and popular disease called the fidgets, now\r\nbegan, indeed, to torment Sir Francis Varney. He could not sit--he could\r\nnot walk, and, somehow or another, he never once seemed to imagine that\r\nfrom the wine cup he should experience any relief, although, upon a side\r\ntable, there stood refreshments of that character. And thus some more\r\ntime passed away, and he strove to cheat it of its weariness by thinking\r\nof a variety of subjects; but as the fates would have it, there seemed\r\nnot one agreeable reminiscence in the mind of that most inexplicable\r\nman, and the more he plunged into the recesses of memory the more\r\nuneasy, not to say almost terrified, he looked and became. A shuddering\r\nnervousness came across him, and, for a few moments, he sat as if he\r\nwere upon the point of fainting. By a vigorous effort, however, he shook\r\nthis off, and then placing before him the watch, which now indicated\r\nabout the quarter past eleven, he strove with a calmer aspect to wait\r\nthe coming of him whose presence, when he did come, would really be a\r\ngreat terror, since the very thought beforehand produced so much\r\nhesitation and apparent dismay.\r\n\r\nIn order too, if possible, then to further withdraw himself from a too\r\npainful consideration of those terrors, which in due time the reader\r\nwill be acquainted with the cause of, he took up a book, and plunging at\r\nrandom into its contents, he amused his mind for a time with the\r\nfollowing brief narrative:--\r\n\r\nThe wind howled round the gable ends of Bridport House in sudden and\r\nfurious gusts, while the inmates sat by the fire-side, gazing in silence\r\nupon the blazing embers of the huge fire that shed a red and bright\r\nlight all over the immense apartment in which they all sat.\r\n\r\nIt was an ancient looking place, very large, end capable of containing a\r\nnumber of guests. Several were present.\r\n\r\nAn aged couple were seated in tall high straight-backed chairs. They\r\nwere the owners of that lordly mansion, and near them sat two young\r\nmaidens of surpassing beauty; they were dissimilar, and yet there was a\r\nslight likeness, but of totally different complexions.\r\n\r\nThe one had tresses of raven black; eyebrows, eyelashes, and eyes were\r\nall of the same hue; she was a beautiful and proud-looking girl, her\r\ncomplexion clear, with the hue of health upon her cheeks, while a smile\r\nplayed around her lips. The glance of the eye was sufficient to thrill\r\nthrough the whole soul.\r\n\r\nThe other maiden was altogether different; her complexion altogether\r\nfairer--her hair of sunny chestnut, and her beautiful hazel eyes were\r\nshaded by long brown eyelashes, while a playful smile also lit up her\r\ncountenance. She was the younger of the two.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the two young maidens had been directed to the words of\r\nthe aged owner of the house, for he had been speaking a few moments\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThere were several other persons present, and at some little distance\r\nwere many of the domestics who were not denied the privilege of warmth\r\nand rest in the presence of their master.\r\n\r\nThese were not the times, when, if servants sat down, they were deemed\r\nidle; but the daily task done, then the evening hour was spent by the\r\nfire-side.\r\n\r\n"The wind howls and moans," said an aged domestic, "in an awful manner.\r\nI never heard the like."\r\n\r\n"It seems as though some imprisoned spirit was waiting for the repose\r\nthat had been denied on earth," said the old lady as she shifted her\r\nseat and gazed steadily on the fire.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said her aged companion, "it is a windy night, and there will be a\r\nstorm before long, or I\'m mistaken."\r\n\r\n"It was just such a night as that my son Henry left his home," said Mrs.\r\nBradley, "just such another--only it had the addition of sleet and\r\nrain."\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed at the mention of his son\'s name, a tear stood in the\r\neyes of the maidens, while one looked silently at the other, and seemed\r\nto exchange glances.\r\n\r\n"I would that I might again see him before my body seeks its final home\r\nin the cold remorseless grave."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said the fairest of the two maidens, "do not talk thus, let us\r\nhope that we yet may have many years of happiness together."\r\n\r\n"Many, Emma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma, many."\r\n\r\n"Do you know that I am very old, Emma, very old indeed, considering what\r\nI have suffered, such a life of sorrow and ill health is at least equal\r\nto thirty years added to my life."\r\n\r\n"You may have deceived yourself, aunt," said the other maiden; "at all\r\nevents, you cannot count upon life as certain, for the strongest often\r\ngo first, while those who seem much more likely to fall, by care, as\r\noften live in peace and happiness."\r\n\r\n"But I lead no life of peace and happiness, while Henry Bradley is not\r\nhere; besides, my life might be passed without me seeing him again."\r\n\r\n"It is now two years since he was here last," said the old man,\r\n\r\n"This night two years was the night on which he left."\r\n\r\n"This night two years?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"It was this night two years," said one of the servant men, "because old\r\nDame Poutlet had twins on that night."\r\n\r\n"A memorable circumstance."\r\n\r\n"And one died at a twelvemonth old," said the man; "and she had a dream\r\nwhich foretold the event."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and moreover she\'s had the same dream again last Wednesday was a\r\nweek," said the man.\r\n\r\n"And lost the other twin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir, this morning."\r\n\r\n"Omens multiply," said the aged man; "I would that it would seem to\r\nindicate the return of Henry to his home."\r\n\r\n"I wonder where he can have gone to, or what he could have done all this\r\ntime; probably he may not be in the land of the living."\r\n\r\n"Poor Henry," said Emma.\r\n\r\n"Alas, poor boy! We may never see him again--it was a mistaken act of\r\nhis, and yet he knew not otherwise how to act or escape his father\'s\r\ndispleasure."\r\n\r\n"Say no more--say no more upon that subject; I dare not listen to it.\r\nGod knows I know quite enough," said Mr. Bradley; "I knew not he would\r\nhave taken my words so to heart as he did."\r\n\r\n"Why," said the old woman, "he thought you meant what you said."\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, during which all gazed at the blazing fire,\r\nseemingly wrapt in their own meditation.\r\n\r\nHenry Bradley, the son of the apparently aged couple, had left that day\r\ntwo years, and wherefore had he left the home of his childhood?\r\nwherefore had he, the heir to large estates, done this?\r\n\r\nHe had dared to love without his father\'s leave, and had refused the\r\noffer his father made him of marrying a young lady whom he had chosen\r\nfor him, but whom he could not love.\r\n\r\nIt was as much a matter of surprise to the father that the son should\r\nrefuse, as it was to the son that his father should contemplate such a\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n"Henry," said the father, "you have been thought of by me, I have made\r\nproposals for marrying you to the daughter of our neighbour, Sir Arthur\r\nOnslow."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, father!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I wish you to go there with me to see the young lady."\r\n\r\n"In the character of a suitor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the father, "certainly; it\'s high time you were settled."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I would rather not go, father; I have no intention of marrying\r\njust yet. I do not desire to do so."\r\n\r\nThis was an opposition that Mr. Bradley had not expected from his son,\r\nand which his imperious temper could ill brook, and with a darkened brow\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"It is not much, Henry, that I trespass upon your obedience; but when I\r\ndo so, I expect that you will obey me."\r\n\r\n"But, father, this matter affects me for my whole life."\r\n\r\n"That is why I have deliberated so long and carefully over it."\r\n\r\n"But it is not unreasonable that I should have a voice in the affair,\r\nfather, since it may render me miserable."\r\n\r\n"You shall have a voice."\r\n\r\n"Then I say no to the whole regulation," said Henry, decisively.\r\n\r\n"If you do so you forfeit my protection, much more favour; but you had\r\nbetter consider over what you have said. Forget it, and come with me."\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\n"You will not?"\r\n\r\n"No, father; I cannot do as you wish me; my mind is fully made up upon\r\nthat matter."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"And so is mine. You either do as I would have you, or you leave the\r\nhouse, and seek your own living, and you are a beggar."\r\n\r\n"I should prefer being such," said Henry, "than to marry any young lady,\r\nand be unable to love her."\r\n\r\n"That is not required."\r\n\r\n"No! I am astonished! Not necessary to love the woman you marry!"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; if you act justly towards her she ought to be grateful; and\r\nit is all that is requisite in the marriage state. Gratitude will beget\r\nlove, and love in one begets love in the other."\r\n\r\n"I will not argue with you, father, upon the matter. You are a better\r\njudge than I; you have had more experience."\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"And it would be useless to speak upon the subject; but of this I can\r\nspeak--my own resolve--that I will not marry the lady in question."\r\n\r\nThe son had all the stern resolve of the father, but he had also very\r\ngood reasons for what he did. He loved, and was beloved in return; and\r\nhence he would not break his faith with her whom he loved.\r\n\r\nTo have explained this to his father would have been to gain nothing\r\nexcept an accession of anger, and he would have made a new demand upon\r\nhis (the son\'s) obedience, by ordering him to discard from his bosom the\r\nimage that was there indelibly engraven.\r\n\r\n"You will not marry her whom I have chosen for your bride?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Do not talk to me of can and can\'t, when I speak of will and wont. It\r\nIs useless to disguise the fact. You have your free will in the matter.\r\nI shall take no answer but yes or no."\r\n\r\n"Then, no, father."\r\n\r\n"Good, sir; and now we are strangers."\r\n\r\nWith that Mr. Bradley turned abruptly from his son, and left him to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time they had any words of difference together, and it\r\nwas sudden and soon terminated.\r\n\r\nHenry Bradley was indignant at what had happened; he did not think his\r\nfather would have acted as he had done in this instance; but he was too\r\nmuch interested in the fate of another to hesitate for a moment. Then\r\ncame the consideration as to what he should do, now that he had arrived\r\nat such a climax.\r\n\r\nHis first thoughts turned to his mother and sister. He could not leave\r\nthe house without bidding them good-bye. He determined to see his\r\nmother, for his father had left the Hall upon a visit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bradley and Emma were alone when he entered their apartment, and to\r\nthem he related all that had passed between himself and father.\r\n\r\nThey besought him to stay, to remain there, or at least in the\r\nneighbourhood; but he was resolved to quit the place altogether for a\r\ntime, as he could do nothing there, and he might chance to do something\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nUpon this, they got together all the money and such jewels as they could\r\nspare, which in all amounted to a considerable sum; then taking an\r\naffectionate leave of his mother and sister, Henry left the Hall--not\r\nbefore he had taken a long and affectionate farewell of one other who\r\nlived within those walls.\r\n\r\nThis was no other than the raven-eyed maiden who sat by the fire side,\r\nand listened attentively to the conversation that was going on. She was\r\nhis love--she, a poor cousin. For her sake he had braved all his\r\nfather\'s anger, and attempted to seek his fortune abroad.\r\n\r\nThis done, he quietly left the Hall, without giving any one any\r\nintimation of where he was going.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Bradley, when he had said so much to his son, was highly\r\nincensed at what he deemed his obstinacy; and he thought the threat\r\nhanging over him would have had a good effect; but he was amazed when he\r\ndiscovered that Henry had indeed left the Hall, and he knew not whither.\r\n\r\nFor some time he comforted himself with the assurance that he would, he\r\nmust return, but, alas! he came not, and this was the second anniversary\r\nof that melancholy day, which no one more repented of and grieved for,\r\nthan did poor Mr. Bradley.\r\n\r\n"Surely, surely he will return, or let us know where he is," he said;\r\n"he cannot be in need, else he would have written to us for aid."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mrs. Bradley; "it is, I fear, because he has not written,\r\nthat he is in want; he would never write if he was in poverty, lest he\r\nshould cause us unhappiness at his fate. Were he doing well, we should\r\nhear of it, for he would be proud of the result of his own unaided\r\nexertions."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Mr. Bradley, "I can say no more; if I was hasty, so\r\nwas he; but it is passed. I would forgive all the past, if I could but\r\nsee him once again--once again!"\r\n\r\n"How the wind howls," added the aged man; "and it\'s getting worse and\r\nworse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the snow is coming down now in style," said one of the\r\nservants, who brought in some fresh logs which were piled up on the\r\nfire, and he shook the white flakes off his clothes.\r\n\r\n"It will be a heavy fall before morning," said one of the men.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it has been gathering for some days; it will be much warmer than\r\nit has been when it is all down."\r\n\r\n"So it will--so it will."\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a knocking at the gate, and the dogs burst into\r\na dreadful uproar from their kennels.\r\n\r\n"Go, Robert," said Mr. Bradley, "and see who it is that knocks such a\r\nnight as this; it is not fit or safe that a dog should be out in it."\r\n\r\nThe man went out, and shortly returned, saying,--\r\n\r\n"So please you, sir, there is a traveller that has missed his way, and\r\ndesires to know if he can obtain shelter here, or if any one can be\r\nfound to guide him to the nearest inn."\r\n\r\n"Bid him come in; we shall lose no warmth because there is one more\r\nbefore the fire."\r\n\r\nThe stranger entered, and said,--"I have missed my way, and the snow\r\ncomes down so thick and fast, and is whirled in such eddies, that I\r\nfear, by myself, I should fall into some drift, and perish before\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of it, sir," said Mr. Bradley; "such a night as this is a\r\nsufficient apology for the request you make, and an inducement to me to\r\ngrant it most willingly."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," replied the stranger; "the welcome is most seasonable."\r\n\r\n"Be seated, sir; take your seat by the ingle; it is warm."\r\n\r\nThe stranger seated himself, and seemed lost in reflection, as he gazed\r\nintently on the blazing logs. He was a robust man, with great whiskers\r\nand beard, and, to judge from his outward habiliments, he was a stout\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"Have you travelled far?"\r\n\r\n"I have, sir."\r\n\r\n"You appear to belong to the army, if I mistake not?"\r\n\r\n"I do, sir."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; the stranger seemed not inclined to speak of himself\r\nmuch; but Mr. Bradley continued,--\r\n\r\n"Have you come from foreign service, sir? I presume you have."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have not been in this country more than six days."\r\n\r\n"Indeed; shall we have peace think you?"\r\n\r\n"I do so, and I hope it may be so, for the sake of many who desire to\r\nreturn to their native land, and to those they love best."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradley heaved a deep sigh, which was echoed softly by all present,\r\nand the stranger looked from one to another, with a hasty glance, and\r\nthen turned his gaze upon the fire.\r\n\r\n"May I ask, sir, if you have any person whom you regard in the army--any\r\nrelative?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! I have--perhaps, I ought to say I had a son. I know not, however,\r\nwhere he is gone."\r\n\r\n"Oh! a runaway; I see."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; he left because there were some family differences, and now, I\r\nwould, that he were once more here."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the stranger, softly, "differences and mistakes will happen\r\nnow and then, when least desired."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an old hound who had lain beside Ellen Mowbray, she who\r\nwore the coal-black tresses, lifted his head at the difference in sound\r\nthat was noticed in the stranger\'s voice. He got up and slowly walked up\r\nto him, and began to smell around him, and, in another moment, he rushed\r\nat him with a cry of joy, and began to lick and caress him in the most\r\nextravagant manner. This was followed by a cry of joy in all present.\r\n\r\n"It is Henry!" exclaimed Ellen Mowbray, rising and rushing into his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIt was Henry, and he threw off the several coats he had on, as well as\r\nthe large beard he wore to disguise himself.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was a happy one; there was not a more joyful house than that\r\nwithin many miles around. Henry was restored to the arms of those who\r\nloved him, and, in a month, a wedding was celebrated between him and his\r\ncousin Ellen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney glanced at his watch. It indicated but five minutes\r\nto twelve o\'clock, and he sprang to his feet. Even as he did so, a loud\r\nknocking at the principal entrance to his house awakened every echo\r\nwithin its walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE THOUSAND POUNDS.--THE STRANGER\'S PRECAUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVarney moved not now, nor did he speak, but, like a statue, he stood,\r\nwith his unearthly looking eyes rivetted upon the door of the apartment.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments one of his servants came, and said--\r\n\r\n"Sir, a person is here, who says he wants to see you. He desired me to\r\nsay, that he had ridden far, and that moments were precious when the\r\ntide of life was ebbing fast."\r\n\r\n"Yes! yes!" gasped Varney; "admit him, I know him! Bring him here? It\r\nis--an--old friend--of mine."\r\n\r\nHe sank into a chair, and still he kept his eyes fixed upon that door\r\nthrough which his visitor must come. Surely some secret of dreadful\r\nmoment must be connected with him whom Sir Francis expected--dreaded--and\r\nyet dared not refuse to see. And now a footstep approaches--a slow and a\r\nsolemn footstep--it pauses a moment at the door of the apartment, and\r\nthen the servant flings it open, and a tall man enters. He is enveloped\r\nin the folds of a horseman\'s cloak, and there is the clank of spurs upon\r\nhis heels as he walks into the room.\r\n\r\nVarney rose again, but he said not a word and for a few moments they\r\nstood opposite each other in silence. The domestic has left the room,\r\nand the door is closed, so that there was nothing to prevent them from\r\nconversing; and, yet, silent they continued for some minutes. It seemed\r\nas if each was most anxious that the other should commence the\r\nconversation, first.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was nothing so very remarkable in the appearance of that\r\nstranger which should entirely justify Sir Francis Varney, in feeling so\r\nmuch alarm at his presence. He certainly was a man past the prime of\r\nlife; and he looked like one who had battled much with misfortune, and\r\nas if time had not passed so lightly over his brow, but that it had left\r\ndeep traces of its progress. The only thing positively bad about his\r\ncountenance, was to be found in his eyes. There there was a most\r\nungracious and sinister expression, a kind of lurking and suspicions\r\nlook, as if he were always resolving in his mind some deep laid scheme,\r\nwhich might be sufficient to circumvent the whole of mankind.\r\n\r\nFinding, probably, that Varney would not speak first, he let his cloak\r\nfall more loosely about him, and in a low, deep tone, he said,\r\n\r\n"I presume I was expected?"\r\n\r\n"You were," said Varney. "It is the day, and it is the hour."\r\n\r\n"You are right. I like to see you so mindful. You don\'t improve in looks\r\nsince--"\r\n\r\n"Hush--hush! no more of that; can we not meet without a dreadful\r\nallusion to the past! There needs nothing to remind me of it; and your\r\npresence here now shows that you are not forgetful. Speak not of that\r\nfearful episode. Let no words combine to place it in a tangible shape to\r\nhuman understanding. I cannot, dare not, hear you speak of that."\r\n\r\n"It is well," said the stranger; "as you please. Let our interview be\r\nbrief. You know my errand?"\r\n\r\n"I do. So fearful a drag upon limited means, is not likely to be readily\r\nforgotten."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are too ingenious--too full of well laid schemes, and to apt\r\nand ready in their execution, to feel, as any fearful drag, the\r\nconditions of our bargain. Why do you look at me so earnestly?"\r\n\r\n"Because," said Varney--and he trembled as he spoke--"because each\r\nlineament of your countenance brings me back to the recollection of the\r\nonly scene in life that made me shudder, and which I cannot think of,\r\neven with the indifference of contempt. I see it all before my mind\'s\r\neye, coming in frightful panoramic array, those incidents, which even to\r\ndream of, are sufficient to drive the soul to madness; the dread of this\r\nannual visit, hangs upon me like a dark cloud upon my very heart; it\r\nsits like some foul incubus, destroying its vitality and dragging me,\r\nfrom day to day, nearer to that tomb, from whence not as before, I can\r\nemerge."\r\n\r\n"You have been among the dead?" said the stranger.\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"And yet are mortal."\r\n\r\n"Yes," repeated Varney, "yes, and yet am mortal."\r\n\r\n"It was I that plucked you back to that world, which, to judge from your\r\nappearance, has had since that eventful period but few charms for you.\r\nBy my faith you look like--"\r\n\r\n"Like what I am," interrupted Varney.\r\n\r\n"This is a subject that once a year gets frightfully renewed between us.\r\nFor weeks before your visit I am haunted by frightful recollections, and\r\nit takes me many weeks after you are gone, before I can restore myself\r\nto serenity. Look at me; am I not an altered man?"\r\n\r\n"In faith you are," said the stranger "I have no wish to press upon you\r\npainful recollections. And yet \'tis strange to me that upon such a man\r\nas you, the event to which you allude should produce so terrible an\r\nimpression."\r\n\r\n"I have passed through the agony of death," said Varney, "and have again\r\nendured the torture--for it is such--of the re-union of the body and the\r\nsoul; not having endured so much, not the faintest echo of such feelings\r\ncan enter into your imagination."\r\n\r\n"There may be truth in that, and yet, like a fluttering moth round a\r\nflame, it seems to me, that when I do see you, you take a terrific kind\r\nof satisfaction in talking of the past."\r\n\r\n"That is strictly true," said Varney; "the images with which my mind is\r\nfilled are frightful. Pent up do they remain for twelve long months. I\r\ncan speak to you, and you only, without disguise, and thus does it seem\r\nto me that I get rid of the uneasy load of horrible imaginings. When you\r\nare gone, and have been gone a sufficient lapse of time, my slumbers are\r\nnot haunted with frightful images--I regain a comparative peace, until\r\nthe time slowly comes around again, when we are doomed to meet."\r\n\r\n"I understand you. You seem well lodged here?"\r\n\r\n"I have ever kept my word, and sent to you, telling you where I am."\r\n\r\n"You have, truly. I have no shadow of complaint to make against you. No\r\none, could have more faithfully performed his bond than you have. I give\r\nyou ample credit for all that, and long may you live still to perform\r\nyour conditions."\r\n\r\n"I dare not deceive you, although to keep such faith I may be compelled\r\nto deceive a hundred others."\r\n\r\n"Of that I cannot judge. Fortune seems to smile upon you; you have not\r\nas yet disappointed me."\r\n\r\n"And will not now," said Varney. "The gigantic and frightful penalty of\r\ndisappointing you, stares me in the face. I dare not do so."\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket, as he spoke, a clasped book, from which he\r\nproduced several bank notes, which he placed before the stranger.\r\n\r\n"A thousand pounds," he said; "that is the agreement."\r\n\r\n"It is to the very letter. I do not return to you a thousand thanks--we\r\nunderstand each other better than to waste time with idle compliment.\r\nIndeed I will go quite as far as to say, truthfully, that did not my\r\nnecessities require this amount from you, you should have the boon, for\r\nwhich you pay that price at a much cheaper rate."\r\n\r\n"Enough! enough!" said Varney. "It is strange, that your face should\r\nhave been the last I saw, when the world closed upon me, and the first\r\nthat met my eyes when I was again snatched back to life! Do you pursue\r\nstill your dreadful trade?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the stranger, "for another year, and then, with such a\r\nmoderate competence as fortune has assigned me, I retire, to make way\r\nfor younger and abler spirits."\r\n\r\n"And then," said Varney, "shall you still require of me such an amount\r\nas this?"\r\n\r\n"No; this is my last visit but one. I shall be just and liberal towards\r\nyou. You are not old; and I have no wish to become the clog of your\r\nexistence. As I have before told you, it is my necessity, and not my\r\ninclination, that sets the value upon the service I rendered you."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, and ought to thank you. And in reply to so much\r\ncourtesy, be assured, that when I shudder at your presence, it is not\r\nthat I regard you with horror, as an individual, but it is because the\r\nsight of you awakens mournfully the remembrance of the past."\r\n\r\n"It is clear to me," said the stranger; "and now I think we part with\r\neach other in a better spirit than we ever did before; and when we meet\r\nagain, the remembrance that it is the last time, will clear away the\r\ngloom that I now find hanging over you."\r\n\r\n"It may! it may! With what an earnest gaze you still regard me!"\r\n\r\n"I do. It does appear to me most strange, that time should not have\r\nobliterated the effects which I thought would have ceased with their\r\ncause. You are no more the man that in my recollection you once were,\r\nthan I am like a sporting child."\r\n\r\n"And I never shall be," said Varney; "never--never again! This self-same\r\nlook which the hand of death had placed upon me, I shall ever wear. I\r\nshudder at myself, and as I oft perceive the eye of idle curiosity fixed\r\nsteadfastly upon me, I wonder in my inmost heart, if even the wildest\r\nguesser hits upon the cause why I am not like unto other men?"\r\n\r\n"No. Of that you may depend there is no suspicion; but I will leave you\r\nnow; we part such friends, as men situated as we are can be. Once again\r\nshall we meet, and then farewell for ever."\r\n\r\n"Do you leave England, then?"\r\n\r\n"I do. You know my situation in life. It is not one which offers me\r\ninducements to remain. In some other land, I shall win the respect and\r\nattention I may not hope for here. There my wealth will win many golden\r\nopinions; and casting, as best I may, the veil of forgetfulness over my\r\nformer life, my declining years may yet be happy. This money, that I\r\nhave had of you from time to time, has been more pleasantly earned than\r\nall beside. Wrung, as it has been, from your fears, still have I taken\r\nit with less reproach. And now, farewell!"\r\n\r\nVarney rang for a servant to show the stranger from the house, and\r\nwithout another word they parted.\r\n\r\nThen, when he was alone, that mysterious owner of that costly home drew\r\na long breath of apparently exquisite relief.\r\n\r\n"That is over!--that is over!" he said. "He shall have the other\r\nthousand pounds, perchance, sooner than he thinks. With all expedition I\r\nwill send it to him. And then on that subject I shall be at peace. I\r\nshall have paid a large sum; but that which I purchased was to me\r\npriceless. It was my life!--it was my life itself! That possession which\r\nthe world\'s wealth cannot restore! And shall I grudge these thousands,\r\nwhich have found their way into this man\'s hands? No! \'Tis true, that\r\nexistence, for me, has lost some of its most resplendent charms. \'Tis\r\ntrue, that I have no earthly affections, and that shunning companionship\r\nwith all, I am alike shunned by all; and yet, while the life-blood still\r\nwill circulate within my shrunken veins, I cling to vitality."\r\n\r\nHe passed into an inner room, and taking from a hook, on which it hung,\r\na long, dark-coloured cloak, he enveloped his tall, unearthly figure\r\nwithin its folds.\r\n\r\nThen, with his hat in his hand, he passed out of his house, and appeared\r\nto be taking his way towards Bannerworth House.\r\n\r\nSurely it must be guilt of no common die that could oppress a man so\r\ndestitute of human sympathies as Sir Francis Varney. The dreadful\r\nsuspicions that hovered round him with respect to what he was, appeared\r\nto gather confirmation from every act of his existence.\r\n\r\nWhether or not this man, to whom he felt bound to pay annually so large\r\na sum, was in the secret, and knew him to be something more than\r\nearthly, we cannot at present declare; but it would seem from the tenor\r\nof their conversation as if such were the fact.\r\n\r\nPerchance he had saved him from the corruption of the tomb, by placing\r\nout, on some sylvan spot, where the cold moonbeams fell, the apparently\r\nlifeless form, and now claimed so large a reward for such a service, and\r\nthe necessary secrecy contingent upon it.\r\n\r\nWe say this may be so, and yet again some more natural and rational\r\nexplanation may unexpectedly present itself; and there may be yet a dark\r\npage in Sir Francis Varney\'s life\'s volume, which will place him in a\r\nlight of superadded terrors to our readers.\r\n\r\nTime, and the now rapidly accumulating incidents of our tale, will soon\r\ntear aside the veil of mystery that now envelopes some of our _dramatis\r\npersonae_.\r\n\r\nAnd let us hope that in the development of those incidents we shall be\r\nenabled to rescue the beautiful Flora Bannerworth from the despairing\r\ngloom that is around her. Let us hope and even anticipate that we shall\r\nsee her smile again; that the roseate hue of health will again revisit\r\nher cheeks, the light buoyancy of her step return, and that as before\r\nshe may be the joy of all around her, dispensing and receiving\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nAnd, he too, that gallant fearless lover, he whom no chance of time or\r\ntide could sever from the object of his fond affections, he who listened\r\nto nothing but the dictates of his heart\'s best feelings, let us indulge\r\na hope that he will have a bright reward, and that the sunshine of a\r\npermanent felicity will only seem the brighter for the shadows that for\r\na time have obscured its glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE INTERVIEW.--THE CHASE THROUGH THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was with the most melancholy aspect that anything human could well\r\nbear, that Sir Francis Varney took his lonely walk, although perhaps in\r\nsaying so much, probably we are instituting a comparison which\r\ncircumstances scarcely empower us to do; for who shall say that that\r\nsingular man, around whom a very atmosphere of mystery seemed to be\r\nperpetually increasing, was human?\r\n\r\nAverse as we are to believe in the supernatural, or even to invest\r\nhumanity with any preternatural powers, the more than singular facts and\r\ncircumstances surrounding the existence and the acts of that man bring\r\nto the mind a kind of shuddering conviction, that if he be indeed really\r\nmortal he still must possess some powers beyond ordinary mortality, and\r\nbe walking the earth for some unhallowed purposes, such as ordinary men\r\nwith the ordinary attributes of human nature can scarcely guess at.\r\n\r\nSilently and alone he took his way through that beautiful tract of\r\ncountry, comprehending such picturesque charms of hill and dale which\r\nlay between his home and Bannerworth Hall. He was evidently intent upon\r\nreaching the latter place by the shortest possible route, and in the\r\ndarkness of that night, for the moon had not yet risen, he showed no\r\nslight acquaintance with the intricacies of that locality, that he was\r\nat all enabled to pursue so undeviatingly a tract as that which he took.\r\n\r\nHe muttered frequently to himself low, indistinct words as he went, and\r\nchiefly did they seem to have reference to that strange interview he had\r\nso recently had with one who, from some combination of circumstances\r\nscarcely to be guessed at, evidently exercised a powerful control over\r\nhim, and was enabled to make a demand upon his pecuniary resources of\r\nrather startling magnitude.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, from a stray word or two, which were pronounced more\r\ndistinctly, he did not seem to be thinking in anger over that interview;\r\nbut it would appear that it rather had recalled to his remembrance\r\ncircumstances of a painful and a degrading nature, which time had not\r\nbeen able entirely to obliterate from his recollection.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he said, as he paused upon the margin of the wood, to the\r\nconfines of which he, or what seemed to be he, had once been chased by\r\nMarchdale and the Bannerworths--"yes, the very sight of that man recalls\r\nall the frightful pageantry of a horrible tragedy, which I can\r\nnever--never forget. Never can it escape my memory, as a horrible, a\r\nterrific fact; but it is the sight of this man alone that can recall all\r\nits fearful minutiae to my mind, and paint to my imagination, in the\r\nmost vivid colours, every, the least particular connected with that time\r\nof agony. These periodical visits much affect me. For months I dread\r\nthem, and for months I am but slowly recovering from the shocks they\r\ngive me. \'But once more,\' he says--\'but once more,\' and then we shall\r\nnot meet again. Well, well; perchance before that time arrives, I may be\r\nable to possess myself of those resources which will enable me to\r\nforestall his visit, and so at least free myself from the pang of\r\nexpecting him."\r\n\r\nHe paused at the margin of the wood, and glanced in the direction of\r\nBannerworth Hall. By the dim light which yet showed from out the light\r\nsky, he could discern the ancient gable ends, and turret-like windows;\r\nhe could see the well laid out gardens, and the grove of stately firs\r\nthat shaded it from the northern blasts, and, as he gazed, a strong\r\nemotion seemed to come over him, such as no one could have supposed\r\nwould for one moment have possessed the frame of one so apparently\r\nunconnected with all human sympathies.\r\n\r\n"I know this spot well," he said, "and my appearance here on that\r\neventful occasion, when the dread of my approach induced a crime only\r\nsecond to murder itself, was on such a night as this, when all was so\r\nstill and calm around, and when he who, at the merest shadow of my\r\npresence, rather chose to rush on death than be assured it was myself.\r\nCurses on the circumstances that so foiled me! I should have been most\r\nwealthy. I should have possessed the means of commanding the adulation\r\nof those who now hold me but cheaply; but still the time may come. I\r\nhave a hope yet, and that greatness which I have ever panted for, that\r\nmagician-like power over my kind, which the possession of ample means\r\nalone can give, may yet be mine."\r\n\r\nWrapping his cloak more closely around him, he strode forward with that\r\nlong, noiseless step which was peculiar to him. Mechanically he appeared\r\nto avoid those obstacles of hedge and ditch which impeded his pathway.\r\nSurely he had come that road often, or he would not so easily have\r\npursued his way. And now he stood by the edge of a plantation which in\r\nsome measure protected from trespassers the more private gardens of the\r\nHall, and there he paused, as if a feeling of irresolution had come over\r\nhim, or it might be, as indeed it seemed from his subsequent conduct,\r\nthat he had come without any fixed intention, or if with a fixed\r\nintention, without any regular plan of carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nDid he again dream of intruding into any of the chambers of that\r\nmansion, with the ghastly aspect of that terrible creation with which,\r\nin the minds of its inhabitants, he seemed to be but too closely\r\nidentified? He was pale, attenuated, and trembled. Could it be that so\r\nsoon it had become necessary to renew the life-blood in his veins in the\r\nawful manner which it is supposed the vampyre brood are compelled to\r\nprotract their miserable existence?\r\n\r\nIt might be so, and that he was even now reflecting upon how once more\r\nhe could kindle the fire of madness in the brain of that beautiful girl,\r\nwho he had already made so irretrievably wretched.\r\n\r\nHe leant against an aged tree, and his strange, lustrous-looking eyes\r\nseemed to collect every wandering scintillation of light that was\r\naround, and to shine with preternatural intensity.\r\n\r\n"I must, I will," he said, "be master of Bannerworth Hall. It must come\r\nto that. I have set an existence upon its possession, and I will have\r\nit; and then, if with my own hands I displace it brick by brick and\r\nstone by stone, I will discover that hidden secret which no one but\r\nmyself now dreams of. It shall be done by force or fraud, by love or by\r\ndespair, I care not which; the end shall sanctify all means. Ay, even if\r\nI wade through blood to my desire, I say it shall be done."\r\n\r\nThere was a holy and a still calmness about the night much at variance\r\nwith the storm of angry passion that appeared to be momentarily\r\ngathering power in the breast of that fearful man. Not the least sound\r\ncame from Bannerworth Hall, and it was only occasionally that from afar\r\noff on the night air there came the bark of some watchdog, or the low of\r\ndistant cattle. All else was mute save when the deep sepulchral tones of\r\nthat man, if man he was, gave an impulse to the soft air around him.\r\n\r\nWith a strolling movement as if he were careless if he proceeded in that\r\ndirection or not, he still went onward toward the house, and now he\r\nstood by that little summer-house once so sweet and so dear a retreat,\r\nin which the heart-stricken Flora had held her interview with him whom\r\nshe loved with a devotion unknown to meaner minds.\r\n\r\nThis spot scarcely commanded any view of the house, for so enclosed was\r\nit among evergreens and blooming flowers, that it seemed like a very\r\nwilderness of nature, upon which, with liberal hand, she had showered\r\ndown in wild luxuriance her wildest floral beauties.\r\n\r\nIn and around that spot the night air was loaded with sweets. The\r\nmingled perfume of many flowers made that place seem a very paradise.\r\nBut oh, how sadly at variance with that beauty and contentedness of\r\nnature was he who stood amidst such beauty! All incapable as he was of\r\nappreciating its tenderness, or of gathering the faintest moral from its\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n"Why am I here?" he said. "Here, without fixed design or stability of\r\npurpose, like some miser who has hidden his own hoards so deeply within\r\nthe bowels of the earth he cannot hope that he shall ever again be able\r\nto bring them to the light of day. I hover around this spot which I\r\nfeel--which I know--contains my treasure, though I cannot lay my hands\r\nupon it, or exult in its glistening beauty."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he cowered down like some guilty thing, for he heard a\r\nfaint footstep upon the garden path. So light, so fragile was the step,\r\nthat, in the light of day, the very hum of summer insects would have\r\ndrowned the noise; but he heard it, that man of crime--of unholy and\r\nawful impulses. He heard it, and he shrunk down among the shrubs and\r\nflowers till he was hidden completely from observation amid a world of\r\nfragrant essences.\r\n\r\nWas it some one stealthily in that place even as he was, unwelcome or\r\nunknown? or was it one who had observed him intrude upon the privacy of\r\nthose now unhappy precincts, and who was coming to deal upon him that\r\ndeath which, vampyre though he might be, he was yet susceptible of from\r\nmortal hands?\r\n\r\nThe footstep advanced, and lower down he shrunk until his coward-heart\r\nbeat against the very earth itself. He knew that he was unarmed, a\r\ncircumstance rare with him, and only to be accounted for by the\r\ndisturbance of his mind consequent upon the visit of that strange man to\r\nhis house, whose presence had awakened so many conflicting emotions.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer still came that light footstep, and his deep-seated\r\nfears would not let him perceive that it was not the step of caution or\r\nof treachery, but owed its lightness to the natural grace and freedom of\r\nmovement of its owner.\r\n\r\nThe moon must have arisen, although obscured by clouds, through which it\r\ncast but a dim radiance, for the night had certainly grown lighter; so\r\nthat although there were no strong shadows cast, a more diffused\r\nbrightness was about all things, and their outlines looked not so\r\ndancing, and confused the one with the other.\r\n\r\nHe strained his eyes in the direction whence the sounds proceeded, and\r\nthen his fears for his personal safety vanished, for he saw it was a\r\nfemale form that was slowly advancing towards him.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to rise, for with the transient glimpse he got of\r\nit, he knew that it must be Flora Bannerworth; but a second thought,\r\nprobably one of intense curiosity to know what could possibly have\r\nbrought her to such a spot at such a time, restrained him, and he was\r\nquiet. But if the surprise of Sir Francis Varney was great to see Flora\r\nBannerworth at such a time in such a place, we have no doubt, that with\r\nthe knowledge which our readers have of her, their astonishment would\r\nmore than fully equal his; and when we come to consider, that since that\r\neventful period when the sanctity of her chamber had been so violated by\r\nthat fearful midnight visitant, it must appear somewhat strange that she\r\ncould gather courage sufficient to wander forth alone at such an hour.\r\n\r\nHad she no dread of meeting that unearthly being? Did the possibility\r\nthat she might fall into his ruthless grasp, not come across her mind\r\nwith a shuddering consciousness of its probability? Had she no\r\nreflection that each step she took, was taking her further and further\r\nfrom those who would aid her in all extremities? It would seem not, for\r\nshe walked onward, unheeding, and apparently unthinking of the presence,\r\npossible or probable, of that bane of her existence.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at her again. How strange and spectral-like she moves\r\nalong; there seems no speculation in her countenance, but with a strange\r\nand gliding step, she walks like some dim shadow of the past in that\r\nancient garden. She is very pale, and on her brow there is the stamp of\r\nsuffering; her dress is a morning robe, she holds it lightly round her,\r\nand thus she moves forward towards that summer-house which probably to\r\nher was sanctified by having witnessed those vows of pure affection,\r\nwhich came from the lips of Charles Holland, about whose fate there now\r\nhung so great a mystery.\r\n\r\nHas madness really seized upon the brain of that beautiful girl? Has the\r\nstrong intellect really sunk beneath the oppressions to which it has\r\nbeen subjected? Does she now walk forth with a disordered intellect, the\r\nqueen of some fantastic realm, viewing the material world with eyes that\r\nare not of earth; shunning perhaps that which she should have sought,\r\nand, perchance, in her frenzy, seeking that which in a happier frame of\r\nmind she would have shunned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch might have been the impression of any one who had looked upon her\r\nfor a moment, and who knew the disastrous scenes through which she had\r\nso recently passed; but we can spare our readers the pangs of such a\r\nsupposition. We have bespoken their love for Flora Bannerworth, and we\r\nare certain that she has it; therefore would we spare them, even for a\r\nfew brief moments, from imagining that cruel destiny had done its worst,\r\nand that the fine and beautiful spirit we have so much commended had\r\nlost its power of rational reflection. No; thank Heaven, such is not the\r\ncase. Flora Bannerworth is not mad, but under the strong influence of\r\nsome eccentric dream, which has pictured to her mind images which have\r\nno home but in the airy realms of imagination. She has wandered forth\r\nfrom her chamber to that sacred spot where she had met him she loved,\r\nand heard the noblest declaration of truth and constancy that ever\r\nflowed from human lips.\r\n\r\nYes, she is sleeping; but, with a precision such as the somnambulist so\r\nstrangely exerts, she trod the well-known paths slowly, but surely,\r\ntoward that summer\'s bower, where her dreams had not told her lay\r\ncrouching that most hideous spectre of her imagination, Sir Francis\r\nVarney. He who stood between her and her heart\'s best joy; he who had\r\ndestroyed all hope of happiness, and who had converted her dearest\r\naffections into only so many causes of greater disquietude than the\r\nblessings they should have been to her.\r\n\r\nOh! could she have imagined but for one moment that he was there, with\r\nwhat an eagerness of terror would she have flown back again to the\r\nshelter of those walls, where at least was to be found some protection\r\nfrom the fearful vampyre\'s embrace, and where she would be within hail\r\nof friendly hearts, who would stand boldly between her and every thought\r\nof harm.\r\n\r\nBut she knew it not, and onwards she went until the very hem of her\r\ngarment touched the face of Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nAnd he was terrified--he dared not move--he dared not speak! The idea\r\nthat she had died, and that this was her spirit, come to wreak some\r\nterrible vengeance upon him, for a time possessed him, and so paralysed\r\nwith fear was he, that he could neither move nor speak.\r\n\r\nIt had been well if, during that trance of indecision in which his\r\ncoward heart placed him, Flora had left the place, and again sought her\r\nhome; but unhappily such an impulse came not over her; she sat upon that\r\nrustic seat, where she had reposed when Charles had clasped her to his\r\nheart, and through her very dream the remembrance of that pure affection\r\ncame across her, and in the tenderest and most melodious accents, she\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Charles! Charles! and do you love me still? No--no; you have not\r\nforsaken me. Save me, save me from the vampyre!"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and Sir Francis Varney heard her weeping.\r\n\r\n"Fool that I am," he muttered, "to be so terrified. She sleeps. This is\r\none of the phases which a disordered imagination oft puts on. She\r\nsleeps, and perchance this may be an opportunity of further increasing\r\nthe dread of my visitation, which shall make Bannerworth Hall far too\r\nterrible a dwelling-place for her; and well I know, if she goes, they\r\nwill all go. It will become a deserted house, and that is what I want. A\r\nhouse, too, with such an evil reputation, that none but myself, who have\r\ncreated that reputation, will venture within its walls:--a house, which\r\nsuperstition will point out as the abode of evil spirits;--a house, as\r\nit were, by general opinion, ceded to the vampyre. Yes, it shall be my\r\nown; fit dwelling-place for a while for me. I have sworn it shall be\r\nmine, and I will keep my oath, little such as I have to do with vows."\r\n\r\nHe rose, and moved slowly to the narrow entrance of the summer-house; a\r\nmovement he could make, without at all disturbing Flora, for the rustic\r\nseat, on which she sat, was at its further extremity. And there he\r\nstood, the upper part of his gaunt and hideous form clearly defined upon\r\nthe now much lighter sky, so that if Flora Bannerworth had not been in\r\nthat trance of sleep in which she really was, one glance upward would\r\nlet her see the hideous companion she had, in that once much-loved\r\nspot--a spot hitherto sacred to the best and noblest feelings, but now\r\ndoomed for ever to be associated with that terrific spectre of despair.\r\n\r\nBut she was in no state to see so terrible a sight. Her hands were over\r\nher face, and she was weeping still.\r\n\r\n"Surely, he loves me," she whispered; "he has said he loved me, and he\r\ndoes not speak in vain. He loves me still, and I shall again look upon\r\nhis face, a Heaven to me! Charles! Charles! you will come again? Surely,\r\nthey sin against the divinity of love, who would tell me that you love\r\nme not!"\r\n\r\n"Ha!" muttered Varney, "this passion is her first, and takes a strong\r\nhold on her young heart--she loves him--but what are human affections to\r\nme? I have no right to count myself in the great muster-roll of\r\nhumanity. I look not like an inhabitant of the earth, and yet am on it.\r\nI love no one, expect no love from any one, but I will make humanity a\r\nslave to me; and the lip-service of them who hate me in their hearts,\r\nshall be as pleasant jingling music to my ear, as if it were quite\r\nsincere! I will speak to this girl; she is not mad--perchance she may\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nThere was a diabolical look of concentrated hatred upon Varney\'s face,\r\nas he now advanced two paces towards the beautiful Flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE THREAT.--ITS CONSEQUENCES.--THE RESCUE, AND SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S\r\nDANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney now paused again, and he seemed for a few moments to\r\ngloat over the helpless condition of her whom he had so determined to\r\nmake his victim; there was no look of pity in his face, no one touch of\r\nhuman kindness could be found in the whole expression of those\r\ndiabolical features; and if he delayed making the attempt to strike\r\nterror into the heart of that unhappy, but beautiful being, it could not\r\nbe from any relenting feeling, but simply, that he wished for a few\r\nmoments to indulge his imagination with the idea of perfecting his\r\nvillany more effectually.\r\n\r\nAlas! and they who would have flown to her rescue,--they, who for her\r\nwould have chanced all accidents, ay, even life itself, were sleeping,\r\nand knew not of the loved one\'s danger. She was alone, and far enough\r\nfrom the house, to be driven to that tottering verge where sanity ends,\r\nand the dream of madness, with all its terrors, commences.\r\n\r\nBut still she slept--if that half-waking sleep could indeed be\r\nconsidered as any thing akin to ordinary slumber--still she slept, and\r\ncalled mournfully upon her lover\'s name; and in tender, beseeching\r\naccents, that should have melted even the stubbornest hearts, did she\r\nexpress her soul\'s conviction that he loved her still.\r\n\r\nThe very repetition of the name of Charles Holland seemed to be galling\r\nto Sir Francis Varney. He made a gesture of impatience, as she again\r\nuttered it, and then, stepping forward, he stood within a pace of where\r\nshe sat, and in a fearfully distinct voice he said,--\r\n\r\n"Flora Bannerworth, awake! awake! and look upon me, although the sight\r\nblast and drive you to despair. Awake! awake!"\r\n\r\nIt was not the sound of the voice which aroused her from that strange\r\nslumber. It is said that those who sleep in that eccentric manner, are\r\ninsensible to sounds, but that the lightest touch will arouse them in an\r\ninstant; and so it was in this case, for Sir Francis Varney, as he\r\nspoke, laid upon the hand of Flora two of his cold, corpse-like looking\r\nfingers. A shriek burst from her lips, and although the confusion of her\r\nmemory and conceptions was immense, yet she was awake, and the\r\nsomnambulistic trance had left her.\r\n\r\n"Help, help!" she cried. "Gracious Heavens! Where am I?"\r\n\r\nVarney spoke not, but he spread out his long, thin arms in such a manner\r\nthat he seemed almost to encircle her, while he touched her not, so that\r\nescape became a matter of impossibility, and to attempt to do so, must\r\nhave been to have thrown herself into his hideous embrace.\r\n\r\nShe could obtain but a single view of the face and figure of him who\r\nopposed her progress, but, slight as that view was, it more than\r\nsufficed. The very extremity of fear came across her, and she sat like\r\none paralysed; the only evidence of existence she gave consisting in the\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n"The vampyre--the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Varney, "the vampyre. You know me, Flora\r\nBannerworth--Varney, the vampyre; your midnight guest at that feast of\r\nblood. I am the vampyre. Look upon me well; shrink not from my gaze. You\r\nwill do well not to shun me, but to speak to me in such a shape that I\r\nmay learn to love you."\r\n\r\nFlora shook as in a convulsion, and she looked as white as any marble\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\n"This is horrible!" she said. "Why does not Heaven grant me the death I\r\npray for?"\r\n\r\n"Hold!" said Varney. "Dress not up in the false colours of the\r\nimagination that which in itself is sufficiently terrific to need none\r\nof the allurements of romance. Flora Bannerworth, you are\r\npersecuted--persecuted by me, the vampyre. It is my fate to persecute\r\nyou; for there are laws to the invisible as well as the visible creation\r\nthat force even such a being as I am to play my part in the great drama\r\nof existence. I am a vampyre; the sustenance that supports this frame\r\nmust be drawn from the life-blood of others."\r\n\r\n"Oh, horror--horror!"\r\n\r\n"But most I do affect the young and beautiful. It is from the veins of\r\nsuch as thou art, Flora Bannerworth, that I would seek the sustenance\r\nI\'m compelled to obtain for my own exhausted energies. But never yet, in\r\nall my long career--a career extending over centuries of time--never yet\r\nhave I felt the soft sensation of human pity till I looked on thee,\r\nexquisite piece of excellence. Even at the moment when the reviving\r\nfluid from the gushing fountain of your veins was warming at my heart, I\r\npitied and I loved you. Oh, Flora! even I can now feel the pang of being\r\nwhat I am!"\r\n\r\nThere was a something in the tone, a touch of sadness in the manner, and\r\na deep sincerity in these words, that in some measure disabused Flora of\r\nher fears. She sobbed hysterically, and a gush of tears came to her\r\nrelief, as, in almost inarticulate accents, she said,--\r\n\r\n"May the great God forgive even you!"\r\n\r\n"I have need of such a prayer," exclaimed Varney--"Heaven knows I have\r\nneed of such a prayer. May it ascend on the wings of the night air to\r\nthe throne of Heaven. May it be softly whispered by ministering angels\r\nto the ear of Divinity. God knows I have need of such a prayer!"\r\n\r\n"To hear you speak in such a strain," said Flora, "calms the excited\r\nfancy, and strips even your horrible presence of some of its maddening\r\ninfluence."\r\n\r\n"Hush," said the vampire, "you must hear more--you must know more ere\r\nyou speak of the matters that have of late exercised an influence of\r\nterror over you."\r\n\r\n"But how came I here?" said Flora, "tell me that. By what more than\r\nearthly power have you brought me to this spot? If I am to listen to\r\nyou, why should it not be at some more likely time and place?"\r\n\r\n"I have powers," said Varney, assuming from Flora\'s words, that she\r\nwould believe such arrogance--"I have powers which suffice to bend many\r\npurposes to my will--powers incidental to my position, and therefore is\r\nit I have brought you here to listen to that which should make you\r\nhappier than you are."\r\n\r\n"I will attend," said Flora. "I do not shudder now; there\'s an icy\r\ncoldness through my veins, but it is the night air--speak, I will attend\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I will. Flora Bannerworth, I am one who has witnessed time\'s mutations\r\non man and on his works, and I have pitied neither; I have seen the fall\r\nof empires, and sighed not that high reaching ambition was toppled to\r\nthe dust. I have seen the grave close over the young and the\r\nbeautiful--those whom I have doomed by my insatiable thirst for human\r\nblood to death, long ere the usual span of life was past, but I never\r\nloved till now."\r\n\r\n"Can such a being as you," said Flora "be susceptible of such an earthly\r\npassion?"\r\n\r\n"And wherefore not?"\r\n\r\n"Love is either too much of heaven, or too much of earth to find a home\r\nwith thee."\r\n\r\n"No, Flora, no! it may be that the feeling is born of pity. I will save\r\nyou--I will save you from a continuance of the horrors that are\r\nassailing you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! then may Heaven have mercy in your hour of need!"\r\n\r\n"Amen!"\r\n\r\n"May you even yet know peace and joy above."\r\n\r\n"It is a faint and straggling hope--but if achieved, it will be through\r\nthe interposition of such a spirit as thine, Flora, which has already\r\nexercised so benign an influence upon my tortured soul, as to produce\r\nthe wish within my heart, to do a least one unselfish action."\r\n\r\n"That wish," said Flora, "shall be father to the deed. Heaven has\r\nboundless mercy yet."\r\n\r\n"For thy sweet sake, I will believe so much, Flora Bannerworth; it is a\r\ncondition with my hateful race, that if we can find one human heart to\r\nlove us, we are free. If, in the face of Heaven, you will consent to be\r\nmine, you will snatch me from a continuance of my frightful doom, and\r\nfor your pure sake, and on your merits, shall I yet know heavenly\r\nhappiness. Will you be mine?"\r\n\r\nA cloud swept from off the face of the moon, and a slant ray fell upon\r\nthe hideous features of the vampire. He looked as if just rescued from\r\nsome charnel-house, and endowed for a space with vitality to destroy all\r\nbeauty and harmony in nature, and drive some benighted soul to madness.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" shrieked Flora, "never!"\r\n\r\n"Enough," said Varney, "I am answered. It was a bad proposal. I am a\r\nvampyre still."\r\n\r\n"Spare me! spare me!"\r\n\r\n"Blood!"\r\n\r\nFlora sank upon her knees, and uplifted her hands to heaven. "Mercy,\r\nmercy!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Blood!" said Varney, and she saw his hideous, fang-like teeth. "Blood!\r\nFlora Bannerworth, the vampyre\'s motto. I have asked you to love me, and\r\nyou will not--the penalty be yours."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said Flora. "Can it be possible that even you, who have\r\nalready spoken with judgment and precision, can be so unjust? you must\r\nfeel that, in all respects, I have been a victim, most gratuitously--a\r\nsufferer, while there existed no just cause that I should suffer; one\r\nwho has been tortured, not from personal fault, selfishness, lapse of\r\nintegrity, or honourable feelings, but because you have found it\r\nnecessary, for the prolongation of your terrific existence, to attack me\r\nas you have done. By what plea of honour, honesty, or justice, can I be\r\nblamed for not embracing an alternative which is beyond all human\r\ncontrol?--I cannot love you."\r\n\r\n"Then be content to suffer. Flora Bannerworth, will you not, even for a\r\ntime, to save yourself and to save me, become mine?"\r\n\r\n"Horrible proposition!"\r\n\r\n"Then am I doomed yet, perhaps, for many a cycle of years, to spread\r\nmisery and desolation around me; and yet I love you with a feeling which\r\nhas in it more of gratefulness and unselfishness than ever yet found a\r\nhome within my breast. I would fain have you, although you cannot save\r\nme; there may yet be a chance, which shall enable you to escape from the\r\npersecution of my presence."\r\n\r\n"Oh! glorious chance!" said Flora. "Which way can it come? tell me how I\r\nmay embrace it, and such grateful feelings as a heart-stricken mourner\r\ncan offer to him who has rescued her from her deep affliction, shall yet\r\nbe yours."\r\n\r\n"Hear me, then, Flora Bannerworth, while I state to you some particulars\r\nof mysterious existence, of such beings as myself, which never yet have\r\nbeen breathed to mortal ears."\r\n\r\nFlora looked intently at him, and listened, while, with a serious\r\nearnestness of manner, he detailed to her something of the physiology of\r\nthe singular class of beings which the concurrence of all circumstances\r\ntended to make him appear.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, "it is not that I am so enamoured of an existence to\r\nbe prolonged only by such frightful means, which induces me to become a\r\nterror to you or to others. Believe me, that if my victims, those whom\r\nmy insatiable thirst for blood make wretched, suffer much, I, the\r\nvampyre, am not without my moments of unutterable agony. But it is a\r\nmysterious law of our nature, that as the period approaches when the\r\nexhausted energies of life require a new support from the warm, gushing\r\nfountain of another\'s veins, the strong desire to live grows upon us,\r\nuntil, in a paroxysm of wild insanity, which will recognise no\r\nobstacles, human or divine, we seek a victim."\r\n\r\n"A fearful state!" said Flora.\r\n\r\n"It is so; and, when the dreadful repast is over, then again the pulse\r\nbeats healthfully, and the wasted energies of a strange kind of vitality\r\nare restored to us, we become calm again, but with that calmness comes\r\nall the horror, all the agony of reflection, and we suffer far more than\r\ntongue can tell."\r\n\r\n"You have my pity," said Flora; "even you have my pity."\r\n\r\n"I might well demand it, if such a feeling held a place within your\r\nbreast. I might well demand your pity, Flora Bannerworth, for never\r\ncrawled an abject wretch upon the earth\'s rotundity, so pitiable as I."\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on."\r\n\r\n"I will, and with such brief conclusions as I may. Having once attacked\r\nany human being, we feel a strange, but terribly impulsive desire again\r\nto seek that person for more blood. But I love you, Flora; the small\r\namount of sensibility that still lingers about my preternatural\r\nexistence, acknowledges in you a pure and better spirit. I would fain\r\nsave you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! tell me how I may escape the terrible infliction."\r\n\r\n"That can only be done by flight. Leave this place, I implore you! leave\r\nit as quickly as the movement may be made. Linger not--cast not one\r\nregretful look behind you on your ancient home. I shall remain in this\r\nlocality for years. Let me lose sight of you, I will not pursue you;\r\nbut, by force of circumstances, I am myself compelled to linger here.\r\nFlight is the only means by which you may avoid a doom as terrific as\r\nthat which I endure."\r\n\r\n"But tell me," said Flora, after a moment\'s pause, during which she\r\nappeared to be endeavouring to gather courage to ask some fearful\r\nquestion; "tell me if it be true that those who have once endured the\r\nterrific attack of a vampyre, become themselves, after death, one of\r\nthat dread race?"\r\n\r\n"It is by such means," said Varney, "that the frightful brood increases;\r\nbut time and circumstances must aid the development of the new and\r\nhorrible existence. You, however, are safe."\r\n\r\n"Safe! Oh! say that word again."\r\n\r\n"Yes, safe; not once or twice will the vampyre\'s attack have sufficient\r\ninfluence on your mortal frame, as to induce a susceptibility on your\r\npart to become coexistent with such as he. The attacks must be often\r\nrepeated, and the termination of mortal existence must be a consequence\r\nessential, and direct from those attacks, before such a result may be\r\nanticipated."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I understand."\r\n\r\n"If you were to continue my victim from year to year, the energies of\r\nlife would slowly waste away, and, till like some faint taper\'s gleam,\r\nconsuming more sustenance than it received, the veriest accident would\r\nextinguish your existence, and then, Flora Bannerworth, you might become\r\na vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Oh! horrible! most horrible!"\r\n\r\n"If by chance, or by design, the least glimpse of the cold moonbeams\r\nrested on your apparently lifeless remains, you would rise again and be\r\none of us--a terror to yourself and a desolation to all around."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I will fly from here," said Flora. "The hope of escape from so\r\nterrific and dreadful a doom shall urge me onward; if flight can save\r\nme--flight from Bannerworth Hall, I will pause not until continents and\r\noceans divide us."\r\n\r\n"It is well. I\'m able now thus calmly to reason with you. A few short\r\nmonths more and I shall feel the languor of death creeping over me, and\r\nthen will come that mad excitement of the brain, which, were you hidden\r\nbehind triple doors of steel, would tempt me again to seek your\r\nchamber--again to seize you in my full embrace--again to draw from your\r\nveins the means of prolonged life--again to convulse your very soul with\r\nterror."\r\n\r\n"I need no incentives," said Flora, with a shudder, "in the shape of\r\ndescriptions of the past, to urge me on."\r\n\r\n"You will fly from Bannerworth Hall?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" said Flora, "it shall be so; its very chambers now are\r\nhideous with the recollection of scenes enacted in them. I will urge my\r\nbrothers, my mother, all to leave, and in some distant clime we will\r\nfind security and shelter. There even we will learn to think of you with\r\nmore of sorrow than of anger--more pity than reproach--more curiosity\r\nthan loathing."\r\n\r\n"Be it so," said the vampyre; and he clasped his hands, as if with a\r\nthankfulness that he had done so much towards restoring peace at least\r\nto one, who, in consequence of his acts, had felt such exquisite\r\ndespair. "Be it so; and even I will hope that the feelings which have\r\ninduced so desolated and so isolated a being as myself to endeavour to\r\nbring peace to one human heart, will plead for me, trumpet-tongued, to\r\nHeaven!"\r\n\r\n"It will--it will," said Flora.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I do; and I will pray that the thought may turn to certainty in such a\r\ncause."\r\n\r\nThe vampyre appeared to be much affected; and then he added,--\r\n\r\n"Flora, you know that this spot has been the scene of a catastrophe\r\nfearful to look back upon, in the annals of your family?"\r\n\r\n"It has," said Flora. "I know to what you allude; \'tis a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge to all--a sad theme to me, and one I would not court."\r\n\r\n"Nor would I oppress you with it. Your father, here, on this very spot,\r\ncommitted that desperate act which brought him uncalled for to the\r\njudgment seat of God. I have a strange, wild curiosity upon such\r\nsubjects. Will you, in return for the good that I have tried to do you,\r\ngratify it?"\r\n\r\n"I know not what you mean," said Flora.\r\n\r\n"To be more explicit, then, do you remember the day on which your father\r\nbreathed his last?"\r\n\r\n"Too well--too well."\r\n\r\n"Did you see him or converse with him shortly before that desperate act\r\nwas committed?"\r\n\r\n"No; he shut himself up for some time in a solitary chamber."\r\n\r\n"Ha! what chamber?"\r\n\r\n"The one in which I slept myself on the night--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; the one with the portrait--that speaking portrait--the eyes\r\nof which seem to challenge an intruder as he enters the apartment."\r\n\r\n"The same."\r\n\r\n"For hours shut up there!" added Varney, musingly; "and from thence he\r\nwandered to the garden, where, in this summer-house, he breathed his\r\nlast?"\r\n\r\n"It was so."\r\n\r\n"Then, Flora, ere I bid you adieu--"\r\n\r\nThese words were scarcely uttered, when there was a quick, hasty\r\nfootstep, and Henry Bannerworth appeared behind Varney, in the very\r\nentrance of the summer-house.\r\n\r\n"Now," he cried, "for revenge! Now, foul being, blot upon the earth\'s\r\nsurface, horrible imitation of humanity, if mortal arm can do aught\r\nagainst you, you shall die!"\r\n\r\nA shriek came from the lips of Flora, and flinging herself past Varney,\r\nwho stepped aside, she clung to her brother, who made an unavailing pass\r\nwith his sword at the vampyre. It was a critical moment; and had the\r\npresence of mind of Varney deserted him in the least, unarmed as he was,\r\nhe must have fallen beneath the weapon of Henry. To spring, however, up\r\nthe seat which Flora had vacated, and to dash out some of the flimsy and\r\nrotten wood-work at the back of the summer-house by the propulsive power\r\nof his whole frame, was the work of a moment; and before Henry could\r\nfree himself from the clinging embrace of Flora, Varney, the vampyre was\r\ngone, and there was no greater chance of his capture than on a former\r\noccasion, when he was pursued in vain from the Hall to the wood, in the\r\nintricacies of which he was so entirely lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLANATION.--MARCHDALE\'S ADVICE.--THE PROJECTED REMOVAL, AND THE\r\nADMIRAL\'S ANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis extremely sudden movement on the part of Varney was certainly as\r\nunexpected as it was decisive. Henry had imagined, that by taking\r\npossession of the only entrance to the summer-house, he must come into\r\npersonal conflict with the being who had worked so much evil for him and\r\nhis; and that he should so suddenly have created for himself another\r\nmode of exit, certainly never occurred to him.\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, Flora," he said, "unhand me; this is a time for\r\naction."\r\n\r\n"But, Henry, Henry, hear me."\r\n\r\n"Presently, presently, dear Flora; I will yet make another effort to\r\narrest the headlong flight of Varney."\r\n\r\nHe shook her off, perhaps with not more roughness than was necessary to\r\ninduce her to forego her grasp of him, but in a manner that fully showed\r\nhe intended to be free; and then he sprang through the same aperture\r\nwhence Varney had disappeared, just as George and Mr. Marchdale arrived\r\nat the door of the summer-house.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly morning, so that the fields were brightening up with the\r\nfaint radiance of the coming day; and when Henry reached a point which\r\nhe knew commanded an extensive view, he paused, and ran his eye eagerly\r\nalong the landscape, with a hope of discovering some trace of the\r\nfugitive.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, was not the case; he saw nothing, heard nothing of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney; and then he turned, and called loudly to George to join\r\nhim, and was immediately replied to by his brother\'s presence,\r\naccompanied by Marchdale.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, they could exchange a word, a rattling discharge of\r\nfire-arms took place from one of the windows, and they heard the\r\nadmiral, in a loud voice, shouting,--\r\n\r\n"Broadside to broadside! Give it them again, Jack! Hit them between wind\r\nand water!"\r\n\r\nThen there was another rattling discharge, and Henry exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of that firing?"\r\n\r\n"It comes from the admiral\'s room," said Marchdale. "On my life, I think\r\nthe old man must be mad. He has some six or eight pistols ranged in a\r\nrow along the window-sill, and all loaded, so that by the aid of a match\r\nthey can be pretty well discharged as a volley, which he considers the\r\nonly proper means of firing upon the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"It is so," replied George; "and, no doubt, hearing an alarm, he has\r\ncommenced operations by firing into the enemy."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Henry; "he must have his way. I have pursued Varney\r\nthus far, and that he has again retreated to the wood, I cannot doubt.\r\nBetween this and the full light of day, let us at least make an effort\r\nto discover his place of retreat. We know the locality as well as he can\r\npossibly, and I propose now that we commence an active search."\r\n\r\n"Come on, then," said Marchdale. "We are all armed; and I, for one,\r\nshall feel no hesitation in taking the life, if it be possible to do so,\r\nof that strange being."\r\n\r\n"Of that possibility you doubt?" said George, as they hurried on across\r\nthe meadows.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do, and with reason too. I\'m certain that when I fired at him\r\nbefore I hit him; and besides, Flora must have shot him upon the\r\noccasion when we were absent, and she used your pistols Henry, to defend\r\nherself and her mother."\r\n\r\n"It would seem so," said Henry; "and disregarding all present\r\ncircumstances, if I do meet him, I will put to the proof whether he be\r\nmortal or not."\r\n\r\nThe distance was not great, and they soon reached the margin of the\r\nwood; they then separated agreeing to meet within it, at a well-spring,\r\nfamiliar to them all: previous to which each was to make his best\r\nendeavour to discover if any one was hidden among the bush-wood or in\r\nthe hollows of the ancient trees they should encounter on their line of\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Henry finding that he was likely to pass an\r\nexceedingly disturbed, restless night, through agitation of spirits,\r\nhad, after tossing to and fro on his couch for many hours, wisely at\r\nlength risen, and determined to walk abroad in the gardens belonging to\r\nthe mansion, in preference to continuing in such a state of fever and\r\nanxiety, as he was in, in his own chamber.\r\n\r\nSince the vampyre\'s dreadful visit, it had been the custom of both the\r\nbrothers, occasionally, to tap at the chamber door of Flora, who, at her\r\nown request, now that she had changed her room, and dispensed with any\r\none sitting up with her, wished occasionally to be communicated with by\r\nsome member of the family.\r\n\r\nHenry, then, after rapidly dressing, as he passed the door of her\r\nbedroom, was about to tap at it, when to his surprise he found it open,\r\nand upon hastily entering it he observed that the bed was empty, and a\r\nhasty glance round the apartment convinced him that Flora was not there.\r\n\r\nAlarm took possession of him, and hastily arming himself, he roused\r\nMarchdale and George, but without waiting for them to be ready to\r\naccompany him, he sought the garden, to search it thoroughly in case she\r\nshould be anywhere there concealed.\r\n\r\nThus it was he had come upon the conference so strangely and so\r\nunexpectedly held between Varney and Flora in the summer-house. With\r\nwhat occurred upon that discovery the readers are acquainted.\r\n\r\nFlora had promised George that she would return immediately to the\r\nhouse, but when, in compliance with the call of Henry, George and\r\nMarchdale had left her alone, she felt so agitated and faint that she\r\nbegan to cling to the trellis work of the little building for a few\r\nmoments before she could gather strength to reach the mansion.\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes might thus have elapsed, and Flora was in such a\r\nstate of mental bewilderment with all that had occurred, that she could\r\nscarce believe it real, when suddenly a slight sound attracted her\r\nattention, and through the gap which had been made in the wall of the\r\nsummer-house, with an appearance of perfect composure, again appeared\r\nSir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, quietly resuming the discourse which had been broken\r\noff, "I am quite convinced now that you will be much the happier for the\r\ninterview."\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven!" said Flora, "whence have you come from?"\r\n\r\n"I have never left," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"But I saw you fly from this spot."\r\n\r\n"You did; but it was only to another immediately outside the summer\r\nhouse. I had no idea of breaking off our conference so abruptly."\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to add to what you have already stated?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely nothing, unless you have a question to propose to me--I\r\nshould have thought you had, Flora. Is there no other circumstance\r\nweighing heavily upon your mind, as well as the dreadful visitation I\r\nhave subjected you to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Flora. "What has become of Charles Holland?"\r\n\r\n"Listen. Do not discard all hope; when you are far from here you will\r\nmeet with him again."\r\n\r\n"But he has left me."\r\n\r\n"And yet he will be able, when you again encounter him, so far to\r\nextenuate his seeming perfidy, that you shall hold him as untouched in\r\nhonour as when first he whispered to you that he loved you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, joy! joy!" said Flora; "by that assurance you have robbed\r\nmisfortune of its sting, and richly compensated me for all that I have\r\nsuffered."\r\n\r\n"Adieu!" said the vampyre. "I shall now proceed to my own home by a\r\ndifferent route to that taken by those who would kill me."\r\n\r\n"But after this," said Flora, "there shall be no danger; you shall be\r\nheld harmless, and our departure from Bannerworth Hall shall be so\r\nquick, that you will soon be released from all apprehension of vengeance\r\nfrom my brother, and I shall taste again of that happiness which I\r\nthought had fled from me for ever."\r\n\r\n"Farewell," said the vampire; and folding his cloak closely around him,\r\nhe strode from the summer-house, soon disappearing from her sight behind\r\nthe shrubs and ample vegetation with which that garden abounded.\r\n\r\nFlora sunk upon her knees, and uttered a brief, but heartfelt\r\nthanksgiving to Heaven for this happy change in her destiny. The hue of\r\nhealth faintly again visited her cheeks, and as she now, with a feeling\r\nof more energy and strength than she had been capable of exerting for\r\nmany days, walked towards the house, she felt all that delightful\r\nsensation which the mind experiences when it is shaking off the trammels\r\nof some serious evil which it delights now to find that the imagination\r\nhas attired in far worse colours than the facts deserved.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary, after this, to say that the search in the wood\r\nfor Sir Francis Varney was an unproductive one, and that the morning\r\ndawned upon the labours of the brother and of Mr. Marchdale, without\r\ntheir having discovered the least indication of the presence of Varney.\r\nAgain puzzled and confounded, they stood on the margin of the wood, and\r\nlooked sadly towards the brightening windows of Bannerworth Hall, which\r\nwere now reflecting with a golden radiance the slant rays of the morning\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n"Foiled again," remarked Henry, with a gesture of impatience; "foiled\r\nagain, and as completely as before. I declare that I will fight this\r\nman, let our friend the admiral say what he will against such a measure\r\nI will meet him in mortal combat; he shall consummate his triumph over\r\nour whole family by my death, or I will rid the world and ourselves of\r\nso frightful a character."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope," said Marchdale, "that some other course may be adopted,\r\nwhich shall put an end to these proceedings."\r\n\r\n"That," exclaimed Henry, "is to hope against all probability; what other\r\ncourse can be pursued? Be this Varney man or devil, he has evidently\r\nmarked us for his prey."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Indeed, it would seem so," remarked George; "but yet he shall find that\r\nwe will not fall so easily; he shall discover that if poor Flora\'s\r\ngentle spirit has been crushed by these frightful circumstances, we are\r\nof a sterner mould."\r\n\r\n"He shall," said Henry; "I for one will dedicate my life to this matter.\r\nI will know no more rest than is necessary to recruit my frame, until I\r\nhave succeeded in overcoming this monster; I will seek no pleasure here,\r\nand will banish from my mind, all else that may interfere with that one\r\nfixed pursuit. He or I must fall."\r\n\r\n"Well spoken," said Marchdale; "and yet I hope that circumstances may\r\noccur to prevent such a necessity of action, and that probably you will\r\nyet see that it will be wise and prudent to adopt a milder and a safer\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"No, Marchdale, you cannot feel as we feel. You look on more as a\r\nspectator, sympathising with the afflictions of either, than feeling the\r\nfull sting of those afflictions yourself."\r\n\r\n"Do I not feel acutely for you? I\'m a lonely man in the world, and I\r\nhave taught myself now to centre my affections in your family; my\r\nrecollections of early years assist me in so doing. Believe me, both of\r\nyou, that I am no idle spectator of your griefs, but that I share them\r\nfully. If I advise you to be peaceful, and to endeavour by the gentlest\r\nmeans possible to accomplish your aims, it is not that I would counsel\r\nyou cowardice; but having seen so much more of the world than either of\r\nyou have had time or opportunity of seeing, I do not look so\r\nenthusiastically upon matters, but, with a cooler, calmer judgment, I do\r\nnot say a better, I proffer to you my counsel."\r\n\r\n"We thank you," said Henry; "but this is a matter in which action seems\r\nspecially called for. It is not to be borne that a whole family is to be\r\noppressed by such a fiend in human shape as that Varney."\r\n\r\n"Let me," said Marchdale, "counsel you to submit to Flora\'s decision in\r\nthis business; let her wishes constitute the rules of action. She is the\r\ngreatest sufferer, and the one most deeply interested in the termination\r\nof this fearful business. Moreover she has judgment and decision of\r\ncharacter--she will advise you rightly, be assured."\r\n\r\n"That she would advise us honourably," said Henry, "and that we should\r\nfeel every disposition in the world to defer to her wishes our\r\nproposition, is not to be doubted; but little shall be done without her\r\ncounsel and sanction. Let us now proceed homeward, for I am most anxious\r\nto ascertain how it came about that she and Sir Francis Varney were\r\ntogether in that summer-house at so strange an hour."\r\n\r\nThey all three walked together towards the house, conversing in a\r\nsimilar strain as they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULTATION.--THE DUEL AND ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIndependent of this interview which Flora had had with the much dreaded\r\nSir Francis Varney, the circumstances in which she and all who were dear\r\nto her, happened at that moment to be placed, certainly required an\r\namount of consideration, which could not be too soon bestowed.\r\n\r\nBy a combination of disagreeables, everything that could possibly occur\r\nto disturb the peace of the family seemed to have taken place at once;\r\nlike Macbeth\'s, their troubles had truly come in battalions, and now\r\nthat the serenity of their domestic position was destroyed, minor evils\r\nand annoyances which that very serenity had enabled them to hold at\r\narm\'s-length became gigantic, and added much to their distress.\r\n\r\nThe small income, which, when all was happiness, health and peace, was\r\nmade to constitute a comfortable household, was now totally inadequate\r\nto do so--the power to economise and to make the most of a little, had\r\nflown along with that contentedness of spirit which the harmony of\r\ncircumstances alone could produce.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be supposed that poor Mrs. Bannerworth could now, as she\r\nhad formerly done, when her mind was free from anxiety, attend to those\r\ndomestic matters which make up the comforts of a family--distracted at\r\nthe situation of her daughter, and bewildered by the rapid succession of\r\ntroublesome events which so short a period of time had given birth to,\r\nshe fell into an inert state of mind as different as anything could\r\npossibly be, from her former active existence.\r\n\r\nIt has likewise been seen how the very domestics fled from Bannerworth\r\nHall in dismay, rather than remain beneath the same roof with a family\r\nbelieved to be subject to the visitations of so awful a being as a\r\nvampyre.\r\n\r\nAmong the class who occupy positions of servitude, certainly there might\r\nhave been found some, who, with feelings and understandings above such\r\nconsiderations, would have clung sympathetically to that family in\r\ndistress, which they had known under a happier aspect; but it had not\r\nbeen the good fortune of the Bannerworths to have such as these about\r\nthem; hence selfishness had its way, and they were deserted. It was not\r\nlikely, then, that strangers would willingly accept service in a family\r\nso situated, without some powerful impulse in the shape of a higher\r\npecuniary consideration, as was completely out of the power of the\r\nBannerworths to offer.\r\n\r\nThus was it, then, that most cruelly, at the very time that they had\r\nmost need of assistance and of sympathy, this unfortunate family almost\r\nbecame isolated from their kind; and, apart from every other\r\nconsideration, it would have been almost impossible for them to continue\r\ninhabitants of the Hall, with anything like comfort, or advantage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, although the disappearance of Charles Holland no longer\r\nawakened those feelings of indignation at his supposed perfidy which\r\nwere first produced by that event; still, view it in which way they\r\nmight, it was a severe blow of fate, and after it, they one and all\r\nfound themselves still less able to contend against the sea of troubles\r\nthat surrounded them.\r\n\r\nThe reader, too, will not have failed to remark that there was about the\r\nwhole of the family that pride of independence which induced them to\r\nshrink from living upon extraneous aid; and hence, although they felt\r\nand felt truly, that when Admiral Bell, in his frank manner, offered\r\nthem pecuniary assistance, that it was no idle compliment, yet with a\r\nsensitiveness such as they might well be expected to feel, they held\r\nback, and asked each other what prospect there was of emerging from such\r\na state of things, and if it were justifiable to commence a life of\r\ndependence, the end of which was not evident or tangible.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, too, the noble confidence of Flora in her lover, and\r\nnotwithstanding that confidence had been echoed by her brothers, there\r\nwould at times obtrude into the minds of the latter, a feeling of the\r\npossibility, that after all they might be mistaken; and Charles Holland\r\nmight, from some sudden impulse, fancying his future happiness was all\r\nat stake, have withdrawn himself from the Hall, and really written the\r\nletters attributed to him.\r\n\r\nWe say this only obtruded itself occasionally, for all their real\r\nfeelings and aspirations were the other way, although Mr. Marchdale,\r\nthey could perceive, had his doubts, and they could not but confess that\r\nhe was more likely to view the matter calmly and dispassionately than\r\nthey.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the very hesitation with which he spoke upon the subject,\r\nconvinced them of his doubt; for they attributed that hesitation to a\r\nfear of giving them pain, or of wounding the prejudices of Admiral Bell,\r\nwith whom he had already had words so nearly approaching to a quarrel.\r\n\r\nHenry\'s visit to Mr. Chillingworth was not likely to be productive of\r\nany results beyond those of a conjectural character. All that that\r\ngentleman could do was to express a willingness to be directed by them\r\nin any way, rather than suggest any course of conduct himself upon\r\ncircumstances which he could not be expected to judge of as they who\r\nwere on the spot, and had witnessed their actual occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnd now we will suppose that the reader is enabled with us to look into\r\none of the principal rooms of Bannerworth Hall. It is evening, and some\r\ncandles are shedding a sickly light on the ample proportions of the once\r\nhandsome apartment. At solemn consultation the whole of the family are\r\nassembled. As well as the admiral, Mr. Chillingworth, and Marchdale,\r\nJack Pringle, too, walked in, by the sufferance of his master, as if he\r\nconsidered he had a perfect right to do so.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the meeting had been a communication which Flora had\r\nmade concerning her most singular and deeply interesting interview with\r\nthe vampyre. The details of this interview had produced a deep effect\r\nupon the whole of the family. Flora was there, and she looked better,\r\ncalmer, and more collected than she had done for some days past.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the interview she had had with Varney in the summer-house in\r\nthe garden had dispelled a host of imaginary terrors with which she had\r\nsurrounded him, although it had confirmed her fully that he and he only\r\nwas the dreadful being who had caused her so much misery.\r\n\r\nThat interview had tended to show her that about him there was yet\r\nsomething human, and that there was not a danger of her being hunted\r\ndown from place to place by so horrible an existence.\r\n\r\nSuch a feeling as this was, of course, a source of deep consolation; and\r\nwith a firmer voice, and more of her old spirit of cheerfulness about\r\nher than she had lately exhibited, she again detailed the particulars of\r\nthe interview to all who had assembled, concluding by saying,--\r\n\r\n"And this has given me hope of happier days. If it be a delusion, it is\r\na happy one; and now that but a frightful veil of mystery still hangs\r\nover the fate of Charles Holland, I how gladly would I bid adieu to this\r\nplace, and all that has made it terrible. I could almost pity Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, rather than condemn him."\r\n\r\n"That may be true," said Henry, "to a certain extent, sister; but we\r\nnever can forget the amount of misery he has brought upon us. It is no\r\nslight thing to be forced from our old and much-loved home, even if such\r\nproceeding does succeed in freeing us from his persecutions."\r\n\r\n"But, my young friend," said Marchdale, "you must recollect, that\r\nthrough life it is continually the lot of humanity to be endeavouring to\r\nfly from great evils to those which do not present themselves to the\r\nmind in so bad an aspect. It is something, surely, to alleviate\r\naffliction, if we cannot entirely remove it."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Mr. Chillingworth, "to a considerable extent, but\r\nthen it takes too much for granted to please me."\r\n\r\n"How so, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, to remove from Bannerworth Hall is a much less evil\r\nthan to remain at Bannerworth Hall, and be haunted by a vampyre; but\r\nthen that proposition takes for granted that vampyre business, which I\r\nwill never grant. I repeat, again and again, it is contrary to all\r\nexperience, to philosophy, and to all the laws of ordinary nature."\r\n\r\n"Facts are stubborn things," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Apparently," remarked Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; and here we have the fact of a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"The presumed fact. One swallow don\'t make a summer, Mr. Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"This is waste of time," said Henry--"of course, the amount of evidence\r\nthat will suffice to bring conviction to one man\'s mind will fail in\r\ndoing so to another. The question is, what are we to do?"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon Flora, as if this question was more\r\nparticularly addressed to her, and it behoved her, above all others, to\r\nanswer it. She did so; and in a firm, clear voice, she said,--\r\n\r\n"I will discover the fate of Charles Holland, and then leave the Hall."\r\n\r\n"The fate of Charles Holland!" said Marchdale. "Why, really, unless that\r\nyoung gentleman chooses to be communicative himself upon so interesting\r\na subject, we may be a long while discovering his fate. I know that it\r\nis not a romantic view to take of the question, to suppose simply that\r\nhe wrote the three letters found upon his dressing-table, and then\r\ndecamped; but to my mind, it savours most wonderfully of matter-of-fact.\r\nI now speak more freely than I have otherwise done, for I am now upon\r\nthe eve of my departure. I have no wish to remain here, and breed\r\ndissension in any family, or to run a tilt against anybody\'s\r\nprejudices." Here he looked at Admiral Bell. "I leave this house\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a d----d lubberly thief," said the admiral; "the sooner you\r\nleave it the better. Why, you bad-looking son of a gun, what do you\r\nmean? I thought we\'d had enough of that."\r\n\r\n"I fully expected this abuse," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Did you expect that?" said the admiral, as he snatched up an inkstand,\r\nand threw at Marchdale, hitting him a hard knock on the chin, and\r\nbespattering its contents on his breast. "Now I\'ll give you\r\nsatisfaction, you lubber. D--me, if you ain\'t a second Jones, and enough\r\nto sink the ship. Shiver my timbers if I sha\'n\'t say something strong\r\npresently."\r\n\r\n"I really," said Henry, "must protest, Admiral Bell, against this\r\nconduct."\r\n\r\n"Protest and be d----d."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marchdale may be right, sir, or he may be wrong, it\'s a matter of\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind," said Marchdale; "I look upon this old nautical ruffian\r\nas something between a fool and a madman. If he were a younger man I\r\nshould chastise him upon the spot; but as it is I live in hopes yet of\r\ngetting him into some comfortable lunatic asylum."\r\n\r\n"Me into an asylum!" shouted the admiral. "Jack, did you hear that?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Farewell all of you," said Marchdale; "my best wishes be with this\r\nfamily. I cannot remain under this roof to be so insulted."\r\n\r\n"A good riddance," cried the admiral. "I\'d rather sail round the world\r\nwith a shipload of vampyres than with such a humbugging son of a gun as\r\nyou are. D----e, you\'re worse than a lawyer."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," cried they, "Mr. Marchdale, stay."\r\n\r\n"Stay, stay," cried George, and Mrs. Bannerworth, likewise, said stay;\r\nbut at the moment Flora stepped forward, and in a clear voice she\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"No, let him go, he doubts Charles Holland; let all go who doubt Charles\r\nHolland. Mr. Marchdale, Heaven forgive you this injustice you are doing.\r\nWe may never meet again. Farewell, sir!"\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken in so decided a tone, that no one contradicted\r\nthem. Marchdale cast a strange kind of look round upon the family\r\ncircle, and in another instant he was gone.\r\n\r\n"Huzza!" shouted Jack Pringle; "that\'s one good job."\r\n\r\nHenry looked rather resentful, which the admiral could not but observe,\r\nand so, less with the devil-may-care manner in which he usually spoke,\r\nthe old man addressed him.\r\n\r\n"Hark ye, Mr. Henry Bannerworth, you ain\'t best pleased with me, and in\r\nthat case I don\'t know that I shall stay to trouble you any longer, as\r\nfor your friend who has left you, sooner or later you\'ll find him out--I\r\ntell you there\'s no good in that fellow. Do you think I\'ve been cruizing\r\nabout for a matter of sixty years, and don\'t know an honest man when I\r\nsee him. But never mind, I\'m going on a voyage of discovery for my\r\nnephew, and you can do as you like."\r\n\r\n"Heaven only knows, Admiral Bell," said Henry, "who is right and who is\r\nwrong. I do much regret that you have quarrelled with Mr. Marchdale; but\r\nwhat is done can\'t be undone."\r\n\r\n"Do not leave us," said Flora; "let me beg of you, Admiral Bell, not to\r\nleave us; for my sake remain here, for to you I can speak freely and\r\nwith confidence, of Charles, when probably I can do so to no one else.\r\nYou knew him well and have a confidence in him, which no one else can\r\naspire to. I pray you, therefore, to stay with us."\r\n\r\n"Only on one condition," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Name it--name it!\r\n\r\n"You think of letting the Hall?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Let me have it, then, and let me pay a few years in advance. If you\r\ndon\'t, I\'m d----d if I stay another night in the place. You must give me\r\nimmediate possession, too, and stay here as my guests until you suit\r\nyourselves elsewhere. Those are my terms and conditions. Say yes, and\r\nall\'s right; say no, and I\'m off like a round shot from a carronade.\r\nD----me, that\'s the thing, Jack, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of some few moments after this extraordinary offer\r\nhad been made, and then they spoke, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell, your generous offer, and the feelings which dictated it,\r\nare by far too transparent for us to affect not to understand them. Your\r\nactions, Admiral--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother my actions! what are they to you? Come, now, I consider\r\nmyself master of the house, d--n you! I invite you all to dinner, or\r\nsupper, or to whatever meal comes next. Mrs. Bannerworth, will you\r\noblige me, as I\'m an old fool in family affairs, by buying what\'s wanted\r\nfor me and my guests? There\'s the money, ma\'am. Come along, Jack, we\'ll\r\ntake a look over our new house. What do you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"Wants some sheathing, sir, here and there."\r\n\r\n"Very like; but, however, it will do well enough for us; we\'re in port,\r\nyou know. Come along."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\nAnd off went the admiral and Jack, after leaving a twenty pound note in\r\nMrs. Bannerworth\'s lap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nSIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S SEPARATE OPPONENTS.--THE INTERPOSITION OF FLORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe old admiral so completely overcame the family of the Bannerworths by\r\nhis generosity and evident single-mindedness of his behaviour, that\r\nalthough not one, except Flora, approved of his conduct towards Mr.\r\nMarchdale, yet they could not help liking him; and had they been placed\r\nin a position to choose which of the two they would have had remain with\r\nthem, the admiral or Marchdale, there can be no question they would have\r\nmade choice of the former.\r\n\r\nStill, however, it was not pleasant to find a man like Marchdale\r\nvirtually driven from the house, because he presumed to differ in\r\nopinion upon a very doubtful matter with another of its inmates. But as\r\nit was the nature of the Bannerworth family always to incline to the\r\nmost generous view of subjects, the frank, hearty confidence of the old\r\nadmiral in Charles Holland pleased them better than the calm and serious\r\ndoubting of Marchdale.\r\n\r\nHis ruse of hiring the house of them, and paying the rent in advance,\r\nfor the purpose of placing ample funds in their hands for any\r\ncontingency, was not the less amiable because it was so easily seen\r\nthrough; and they could not make up their minds to hurt the feelings of\r\nthe old man by the rejection of his generous offer.\r\n\r\nWhen he had left, this subject was canvassed among them, and it was\r\nagreed that he should have his own way in the matter for the present,\r\nalthough they hoped to hear something from Marchdale, which should make\r\nhis departure appear less abrupt and uncomfortable to the whole of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this conversation, it was made known to Flora with\r\nmore distinctness than under any other circumstances it would have been,\r\nthat George Holland had been on the eve of fighting a duel with Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, previous to his mysterious disappearance.\r\n\r\nWhen she became fully aware of this fact, to her mind it seemed\r\nmaterially to add to the suspicions previously to then entertained, that\r\nfoul means had been used in order to put Charles out of the way.\r\n\r\n"Who knows," she said, "that this Varney may not shrink with the\r\ngreatest terror from a conflict with any human being, and feeling one\r\nwas inevitable with Charles Holland, unless interrupted by some vigorous\r\nact of his own, he or some myrmidons of his may have taken Charles\'s\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think, Flora," said Henry, "that he would have ventured upon\r\nso desperate an act; I cannot well believe such a thing possible. But\r\nfear not; he will find, if he have really committed any such atrocity,\r\nthat it will not save him."\r\n\r\nThese words of Henry, though it made no impression at the time upon\r\nFlora, beyond what they carried upon their surface, they really,\r\nhowever, as concerned Henry himself, implied a settled resolution, which\r\nhe immediately set about reducing to practice.\r\n\r\nWhen the conference broke up, night, as it still was, he, without saying\r\nanything to any one, took his hat and cloak, and left the Hall,\r\nproceeding by the nearest practicable route to the residence of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, where he arrived without any interruption of any\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nVarney was at first denied to him, but before he could leave the house,\r\na servant came down the great staircase, to say it was a mistake; and\r\nthat Sir Francis was at home, and would be happy to see him.\r\n\r\nHe was ushered into the same apartment where Sir Francis Varney had\r\nbefore received his visitors; and there sat the now declared vampyre,\r\nlooking pale and ghastly by the dim light which burned in the apartment,\r\nand, indeed, more like some spectre of the tomb, than one of the great\r\nfamily of man.\r\n\r\n"Be seated, sir," said Varney; "although my eyes have seldom the\r\npleasure of beholding you within these walls, be assured you are a\r\nhonoured guest."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney," said Henry, "I came not here to bandy compliments\r\nwith you; I have none to pay to you, nor do I wish to hear any of them\r\nfrom your lips."\r\n\r\n"An excellent sentiment, young man," said Varney, "and well delivered.\r\nMay I presume, then, without infringing too far upon your extreme\r\ncourtesy, to inquire, to what circumstances I am indebted for your\r\nvisit?"\r\n\r\n"To one, Sir Francis, that I believe you are better acquainted with than\r\nyou will have the candour to admit."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir," said Varney, coldly; "you measure my candour, probably,\r\nby a standard of your own; in which case I fear, I may be no gainer; and\r\nyet that may be of itself a circumstance that should afford little food\r\nfor surprise, but proceed, sir--since we have so few compliments to\r\nstand between us and our purpose, we shall in all due time arrive at\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, in due time, Sir Francis Varney, and that due time has arrived.\r\nKnow you anything of my friend, Mr. Charles Holland?" said Henry, in\r\nmarked accents; and he gazed on Sir Francis Varney with earnestness,\r\nthat seemed to say not even a look should escape his observation.\r\n\r\nVarney, however, returned the gaze as steadily, but coldly, as he\r\nreplied in his measured accents,--\r\n\r\n"I have heard of the young gentleman."\r\n\r\n"And seen him?"\r\n\r\n"And seen him too, as you, Mr. Bannerworth, must be well aware. Surely\r\nyou have not come all this way, merely to make such an inquiry; but,\r\nsir, you are welcome to the answer."\r\n\r\nHenry had something of a struggle to keep down the rising anger, at\r\nthese cool taunts of Varney; but he succeeded--and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"I suspect Charles Holland, Sir Francis Varney, has met with unfair\r\ntreatment, and that he has been unfairly dealt with, for an unworthy\r\npurpose."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," said Varney, "if the gentleman you allude to, has been\r\nunfairly dealt with, it was for a foul purpose; for no good or generous\r\nobject, my young sir, could be so obtained--you acknowledge so much, I\r\ndoubt not?"\r\n\r\n"I do, Sir Francis Varney; and hence the purpose of my visit here--for\r\nthis reason I apply to you--"\r\n\r\n"A singular object, supported by a singular reason. I cannot see the\r\nconnection, young sir; pray proceed to enlighten me upon this matter,\r\nand when you have done that, may I presume upon your consideration, to\r\ninquire in what way I can be of any service to you?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis," said Henry, his anger raising his tones--"this will not\r\nserve you--I have come to exact an account of how you have disposed of\r\nmy friend; and I will have it."\r\n\r\n"Gently, my good sir; you are aware I know nothing of your friend; his\r\nmotions are his own; and as to what I have done with him; my only answer\r\nis, that he would permit me to do nothing with him, had I been so\r\ninclined to have taken the liberty."\r\n\r\n"You are suspected, Sir Francis Varney, of having made an attempt upon\r\nthe life or liberty of Charles Holland; you, in fact, are suspected of\r\nbeing his murderer--and, so help me Heaven! if I have not justice, I\r\nwill have vengeance!"\r\n\r\n"Young sir, your words are of grave import, and ought to be coolly\r\nconsidered before they are uttered. With regard to justice and\r\nvengeance, Mr. Bannerworth, you may have both; but I tell you, of\r\nCharles Holland, or what has become of him, I know nothing. But\r\nwherefore do you come to so unlikely a quarter to learn something of an\r\nindividual of whom I know nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Because Charles Holland was to have fought a duel with you: but before\r\nthat had time to take place, he has suddenly become missing. I suspect\r\nthat you are the author of his disappearance, because you fear an\r\nencounter with a mortal man."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bannerworth, permit me to say, in my own defence, that I do not\r\nfear any man, however foolish he may be; and wisdom is not an attribute\r\nI find, from experience in all men, of your friend. However, you must be\r\ndreaming, sir--a kind of vivid insanity has taken possession of your\r\nmind, which distorts--"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney!" exclaimed Henry, now perfectly uncontrollable.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Varney, as he filled up the pause, "proceed; I am all\r\nattention. You do me honour."\r\n\r\n"If," resumed Henry, "such was your object in putting Mr. Holland aside,\r\nby becoming personally or by proxy an assassin, you are mistaken in\r\nsupposing you have accomplished your object."\r\n\r\n"Go on, sir," said Sir Francis Varney, in a bland and sweet tone; "I am\r\nall attention; pray proceed."\r\n\r\n"You have failed; for I now here, on this spot, defy you to mortal\r\ncombat. Coward, assassin as you are, I challenge you to fight."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean on the carpet here?" said Varney, deliberately.\r\n\r\n"No, sir; but beneath the canopy of heaven, in the light of the day. And\r\nthen, Sir Francis, we shall see who will shrink from the conflict."\r\n\r\n"It is remarkably good, Mr. Bannerworth, and, begging your pardon, for I\r\ndo not wish to give any offence, my honoured sir, it would rehearse\r\nbefore an audience; in short, sir, it is highly dramatic."\r\n\r\n"You shrink from the combat, do you? Now, indeed, I know you."\r\n\r\n"Young man--young man," said Sir Francis, calmly, and shaking his head\r\nvery deliberately, and the shadows passed across his pale face, "you\r\nknow me not, if you think Sir Francis Varney shrinks from any man, much\r\nless one like yourself."\r\n\r\n"You are a coward, and worse, if you refuse my challenge."\r\n\r\n"I do not refuse it; I accept it," said Varney, calmly, and in a\r\ndignified manner; and then, with a sneer, he added,--"You are well\r\nacquainted with the mode in which gentlemen generally manage these\r\nmatters, Mr. Bannerworth, and perhaps I am somewhat confined in my\r\nknowledge in the ways of the world, because you are your own principal\r\nand second. In all my experience, I never met with a similar case."\r\n\r\n"The circumstances under which it is given are as unexampled, and will\r\nexcuse the mode of the challenge," said Henry, with much warmth.\r\n\r\n"Singular coincidence--the challenge and mode of it is most singular!\r\nThey are well matched in that respect. Singular, did I say? The more I\r\nthink of it, Mr. Bannerworth, the more I am inclined to think this\r\npositively odd."\r\n\r\n"Early to-morrow, Sir Francis, you shall hear from me."\r\n\r\n"In that case, you will not arrange preliminaries now? Well, well; it is\r\nvery unusual for the principals themselves to do so; and yet, excuse my\r\nfreedom, I presumed, as you had so far deserted the beaten track, that I\r\nhad no idea how far you might be disposed to lead the same route."\r\n\r\n"I have said all I intended to say, Sir Francis Varney; we shall see\r\neach other again."\r\n\r\n"I may not detain you, I presume, to taste aught in the way of\r\nrefreshment?"\r\n\r\nHenry made no reply, but turned towards the door, without even making an\r\nattempt to return the grave and formal bow that Sir Francis Varney made\r\nas he saw him about to quit the apartment; for Henry saw that his pale\r\nfeatures were lighted up with a sarcastic smile, most disagreeable to\r\nlook upon as well as irritating to Henry Bannerworth.\r\n\r\nHe now quitted Sir Francis Varney\'s abode, being let out by a servant\r\nwho had been rung for for that purpose by his master.\r\n\r\nHenry walked homeward, satisfied that he had now done all that he could\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n"I will send Chillingworth to him in the morning, and then I shall see\r\nwhat all this will end in. He must meet me, and then Charles Holland, if\r\nnot discovered, shall be, at least, revenged."\r\n\r\nThere was another person in Bannerworth Hall who had formed a similar\r\nresolution. That person was a very different sort of person to Henry\r\nBannerworth, though quite as estimable in his way.\r\n\r\nThis was no other than the old admiral. It was singular that two such\r\nvery different persons should deem the same steps necessary, and both\r\nkeep the secret from each other; but so it was, and, after some internal\r\nswearing, he determined upon challenging Varney in person.\r\n\r\n"I\'d send Jack Pringle, but the swab would settle the matter as shortly\r\nas if a youngster was making an entry in a log, and heard the\r\nboatswain\'s whistle summoning the hands to a mess, and feared he would\r\nlose his grog.\r\n\r\n"D--n my quarters! but Sir Francis Varney, as he styles himself, sha\'n\'t\r\nmake any way against old Admiral Bell. He\'s as tough as a hawser, and\r\njust the sort of blade for a vampyre to come athwart. I\'ll pitch him\r\nend-long, and make a plank of him afore long. Cus my windpipe! what a\r\nlong, lanky swab he is, with teeth fit to unpick a splice; but let me\r\nalone, I\'ll see if I can\'t make a hull of his carcass, vampyre or no\r\nvampyre.\r\n\r\n"My nevy, Charles Holland, can\'t be allowed to cut away without nobody\'s\r\nleave or licence. No, no; I\'ll not stand that anyhow. \'Never desert a\r\nmessmate in the time of need,\' is the first maxim of a seaman, and I\r\nain\'t the one as \'ll do so."\r\n\r\nThus self-communing, the old admiral marched along until he came to Sir\r\nFrancis Varney\'s house, at the gate of which he gave the bell what he\r\ncalled a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, that set it\r\nringing with a fury, the like of which had never certainly been heard by\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\nA minute or two scarcely elapsed before the domestics hurried to answer\r\nso urgent a summons; and when the gate was opened, the servant who\r\nanswered it inquired his business.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you, snob? Is your master, Sir Francis Varney, in?\r\nbecause, if he be, let him know old Admiral Bell wants to speak to him.\r\nD\'ye hear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied the servant, who had paused a few moments to examine\r\nthe individual who gave this odd kind of address.\r\n\r\nIn another minute word was brought to him that Sir Francis Varney would\r\nbe very happy to see Admiral Bell.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," he muttered; "just as the devil likes to meet with holy water,\r\nor as I like any water save salt water."\r\n\r\nHe was speedily introduced to Sir Francis Varney, who was seated in the\r\nsame posture as he had been left by Henry Bannerworth not many minutes\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell," said Sir Francis, rising, and bowing to that individual\r\nin the most polite, calm, and dignified manner imaginable, "permit me to\r\nexpress the honour I feel at this unexpected visit."\r\n\r\n"None of your gammon."\r\n\r\n"Will you be seated. Allow me to offer you such refreshments as this\r\npoor house affords."\r\n\r\n"D--n all this! You know, Sir Francis, I don\'t want none o\' this\r\npalaver. It\'s for all the world like a Frenchman, when you are going to\r\ngive him a broadside; he makes grimaces, throws dust in your eyes, and\r\ntries to stab you in the back. Oh, no! none of that for me."\r\n\r\n"I should say not, Admiral Bell. I should not like it myself, and I dare\r\nsay you are a man of too much experience not to perceive when you are or\r\nare not imposed upon."\r\n\r\n"Well, what is that to you? D--n me, I didn\'t come here to talk to you\r\nabout myself."\r\n\r\n"Then may I presume upon your courtesy so far as to beg that you will\r\nenlighten me upon the object of your visit!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; in pretty quick time. Just tell me where you have stowed away my\r\nnephew, Charles Holland?"\r\n\r\n"Really, I--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your slack, will you, and hear me out; if he\'s living, let him\r\nout, and I\'ll say no more about it; that\'s liberal, you know; it ain\'t\r\nterms everybody would offer you."\r\n\r\n"I must, in truth, admit they are not; and, moreover, they quite\r\nsurprise even me, and I have learned not to be surprised at almost\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, will you give him up alive? but, hark ye, you mustn\'t have made\r\nvery queer fish of him, do ye see?"\r\n\r\n"I hear you," said Sir Francis, with a bland smile, passing one hand\r\ngently over the other, and showing his front teeth in a peculiar manner;\r\n"but I really cannot comprehend all this; but I may say, generally, that\r\nMr. Holland is no acquaintance of mine, and I have no sort of knowledge\r\nwhere he may be."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do for me," said the admiral, positively, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"I am particularly sorry, Admiral Bell, that it will not, seeing that I\r\nhave nothing else to say."\r\n\r\n"I see how it is; you\'ve put him out of the way, and I\'m d----d if you\r\nshan\'t bring him to life, whole and sound, or I\'ll know the reason why."\r\n\r\n"With that I have already furnished you, Admiral Bell," quietly rejoined\r\nVarney; "anything more on that head is out of my power, though my\r\nwillingness to oblige a person of such consideration as yourself, is\r\nvery great; but, permit me to add, this is a very strange and odd\r\ncommunication from one gentleman to another. You have lost a relative,\r\nwho has, very probably, taken some offence, or some notion into his\r\nhead, of which nobody but himself knows anything, and you come to one\r\nyet more unlikely to know anything of him, than even yourself.\r\n\r\n"Gammon again, now, Sir Francis Varney, or Blarney."\r\n\r\n"Varney, if you please, Admiral Bell; I was christened Varney."\r\n\r\n"Christened, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, christened--were you not christened? If not, I dare say you\r\nunderstand the ceremony well enough."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I should think I did; but, as for christening, a--"\r\n\r\n"Go on, sir."\r\n\r\n"A vampyre! why I should as soon think of reading the burial service of\r\na pig."\r\n\r\n"Very possible; but what has all this to do with your visit to me?"\r\n\r\n"This much, you lubber. Now, d--n my carcass from head to stern, if I\r\ndon\'t call you out."\r\n\r\n"Well, Admiral Bell," slid Varney, mildly, "in that case, I suppose I\r\nmust come out; but why do you insist that I have any knowledge of your\r\nnephew, Mr. Charles Holland?"\r\n\r\n"You were to have fought a duel with him, and now he\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"I am here," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the admiral, "that\'s as plain as a purser\'s shirt upon a\r\nhandspike; but that\'s the very reason why my nevey ain\'t here, and\r\nthat\'s all about it."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s marvellous little, so far as the sense is concerned," said\r\nVarney, without the movement of a muscle.\r\n\r\n"It is said that people of your class don\'t like fighting mortal men;\r\nnow you have disposed of him, lest he should dispose of you."\r\n\r\n"That is explicit, but it is to no purpose, since the gentleman in\r\nquestion hasn\'t placed himself at my disposal."\r\n\r\n"Then, d----e, I will; fish, flesh, or fowl, I don\'t care; all\'s one to\r\nAdmiral Bell. Come fair or fowl, I\'m a tar for all men; a seaman ever\r\nready to face a foe, so here goes, you lubberly moon manufactured calf."\r\n\r\n"I hear, admiral, but it is scarcely civil, to say the least of it;\r\nhowever, as you are somewhat eccentric, and do not, I dare say, mean all\r\nyour words imply, I am quite willing to make every allowance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any allowance; d--n you and your allowance, too; nothing\r\nbut allowance of grog, and a pretty good allowance, too, will do for me,\r\nand tell you, Sir Francis Varney," said the admiral, with much wrath,\r\n"that you are a d----d lubberly hound, and I\'ll fight you; yes, I\'m\r\nready to hammer away, or with anything from a pop-gun to a ship\'s gun;\r\nyou don\'t come over me with your gammon, I tell you. You\'ve murdered\r\nCharles Holland because you couldn\'t face him--that\'s the truth of it."\r\n\r\n"With the other part of your speech, Admiral Bell, allow me to say, you\r\nhave mixed up a serious accusation--one I cannot permit to pass\r\nlightly."\r\n\r\n"Will you or not fight?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I shall be happy to serve you any way that I can. I hope this\r\nwill be an answer to your accusation, also."\r\n\r\n"That\'s settled, then."\r\n\r\n"Why, I am not captious, Admiral Bell, but it is not generally usual for\r\nthe principals to settle the preliminaries themselves; doubtless you, in\r\nyour career of fame and glory, know something of the manner in which\r\ngentlemen demean themselves on these occasions."\r\n\r\n"Oh, d--n you! Yes, I\'ll send some one to do all this. Yes, yes, Jack\r\nPringle will be the man, though Jack ain\'t a holiday, shore-going,\r\nsmooth-spoken swab, but as good a seaman as ever trod deck or handled a\r\nboarding-pike."\r\n\r\n"Any friend of yours," said Varney, blandly, "will be received and\r\ntreated as such upon an errand of such consequence; and now our\r\nconference has, I presume, concluded."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I\'ve done--d----e, no--yes--no. I will keel-haul you but I\'ll\r\nknow something of my neavy, Charles Holland."\r\n\r\n"Good day, Admiral Bell." As Varney spoke, he placed his hand upon the\r\nbell which he had near him, to summon an attendant to conduct the\r\nadmiral out. The latter, who had said a vast deal more than he ever\r\nintended, left the room in a great rage, protesting to himself that he\r\nwould amply avenge his nephew, Charles Holland.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded homeward, considerably vexed and annoyed that he had been\r\ntreated with so much calmness, and all knowledge of his nephew denied.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back, he quarrelled heartily with Jack Pringle--made it\r\nup--drank grog--quarrelled--made it up, and finished with grog\r\nagain--until he went to bed swearing he should like to fire a broadside\r\nat the whole of the French army, and annihilate it at once.\r\n\r\nWith this wish, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, Henry Bannerworth sought Mr. Chillingworth, and\r\nhaving found him, he said in a serious tone,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chillingworth, I have rather a serious favour to ask you, and one\r\nwhich you may hesitate in granting."\r\n\r\n"It must be very serious indeed," said Mr. Chillingworth, "that I should\r\nhesitate to grant it to you; but pray inform me what it is that you deem\r\nso serious?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney and I must have a meeting," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Have you really determined upon such a course?" said Mr. Chillingworth;\r\n"you know the character of your adversary?"\r\n\r\n"That is all settled,--I have given a challenge, and he has accepted it;\r\nso all other considerations verge themselves into one--and that is the\r\nwhen, where, and how."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Mr. Chillingworth. "Well, since it cannot be helped on\r\nyour part, I will do what is requisite for you--do you wish anything to\r\nbe done or insisted on in particular in this affair."\r\n\r\n"Nothing with regard to Sir Francis Varney that I may not leave to your\r\ndiscretion. I feel convinced that he is the assassin of Charles Holland,\r\nwhom he feared to fight in duel."\r\n\r\n"Then there remains but little else to do, but to arrange preliminaries,\r\nI believe. Are you prepared on every other point?"\r\n\r\n"I am--you will see that I am the challenger, and that he must now\r\nfight. What accident may turn up to save him, I fear not, but sure I am,\r\nthat he will endeavour to take every advantage that may arise, and so\r\nescape the encounter."\r\n\r\n"And what do you imagine he will do now he has accepted your challenge?"\r\nsaid Mr. Chillingworth; "one would imagine he could not very well\r\nescape."\r\n\r\n"No--but he accepted the challenge which Charles Holland sent him--a\r\nduel was inevitable, and it seems to me to be a necessary consequence\r\nthat he disappeared from amongst us, for Mr. Holland would never have\r\nshrunk from the encounter."\r\n\r\n"There can be no sort of suspicion about that," remarked Chillingworth;\r\n"but allow me to advise you that you take care of yourself, and keep a\r\nwatchful eye upon every one--do not be seen out alone."\r\n\r\n"I fear not."\r\n\r\n"Nay, the gentleman who has disappeared was, I am sure, fearless enough;\r\nbut yet that has not saved him. I would not advise you to be fearful,\r\nonly watchful; you have now an event awaiting upon you, which it is well\r\nyou should go through with, unless circumstances should so turn out,\r\nthat it is needless; therefore I say, when you have the suspicions you\r\ndo entertain of this man\'s conduct, beware, be cautious, and vigilant."\r\n\r\n"I will do so--in the mean time, I trust myself confidently in your\r\nhands--you know all that is necessary."\r\n\r\n"This affair is quite a secret from all of the family?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly so, and will remain so--I shall be at the Hall."\r\n\r\n"And there I will see you--but be careful not to be drawn into any\r\nadventure of any kind--it is best to be on the safe side under all\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"I will be especially careful, be assured, but farewell; see Sir Francis\r\nVarney as early as you can, and let the meeting be as early as you can,\r\nand thus diminish the chance of accident."\r\n\r\n"That I will attend to. Farewell for the present."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth immediately set about the conducting of the affair\r\nthus confided to him; and that no time might be lost, he determined to\r\nset out at once for Sir Francis Varney\'s residence.\r\n\r\n"Things with regard to this family seem to have gone on wild of late,"\r\nthought Mr. Chillingworth; "this may bring affairs to a conclusion,\r\nthough I had much rather they had come to some other. My life for it,\r\nthere is a juggle or a mystery somewhere; I will do this, and then we\r\nshall see what will come of it; if this Sir Francis Varney meets\r\nhim--and at this moment I can see no reason why he should not do so--it\r\nwill tend much to deprive him of the mystery about him; but if, on the\r\nother hand, he refuse--but then that\'s all improbable, because he has\r\nagreed to do so. I fear, however, that such a man as Varney is a\r\ndreadful enemy to encounter--he is cool and unruffled--and that gives\r\nhim all the advantage in such affairs; but Henry\'s nerves are not bad,\r\nthough shaken by these untowards events; but time will show--I would it\r\nwere all over."\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts and feelings strangely intermixed, Mr. Chillingworth\r\nset forward for Sir Francis Varney\'s house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell slept soundly enough though, towards morning, he fell into\r\na strange dream, and thought he was yard arm and yard arm with a strange\r\nfish--something of the mermaid species.\r\n\r\n"Well," exclaimed the admiral, after a customary benediction of his eyes\r\nand limbs, "what\'s to come next? may I be spliced to a shark if I\r\nunderstand what this is all about. I had some grog last night, but then\r\ngrog, d\'y\'see, is--is--a seaman\'s native element, as the newspapers say,\r\nthough I never read \'em now, it\'s such a plague."\r\n\r\nHe lay quiet for a short time, considering in his own mind what was best\r\nto be done, and what was the proper course to pursue, and why he should\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa, hilloa, hil--loa! Jack a-hoy! a-hoy!" shouted the admiral, as a\r\nsudden recollection of his challenge came across his memory; "Jack\r\nPringle a-hoy? d--n you, where are you?--you\'re never at hand when you\r\nare wanted. Oh, you lubber,--a-hoy!"\r\n\r\n"A-hoy!" shouted a voice, as the door opened, and Jack thrust his head\r\nin; "what cheer, messmate? what ship is this?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you lubberly--"\r\n\r\nThe door was shut in a minute, and Jack Pringle disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa, Jack Pringle, you don\'t mean to say you\'ll desert your colours,\r\ndo you, you dumb dog?"\r\n\r\n"Who says I\'ll desert the ship as she\'s sea-worthy!"\r\n\r\n"Then why do you go away?"\r\n\r\n"Because I won\'t be called lubberly. I\'m as good a man as ever swabbed a\r\ndeck, and don\'t care who says to the contrary. I\'ll stick to the ship as\r\nlong as she\'s seaworthy," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Well, come here, and just listen to the log, and be d----d to you."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the orders now, admiral?" said Jack, "though, as we are paid\r\noff--"\r\n\r\n"There, take that, will you?" said Admiral Bell, as he flung a pillow at\r\nJack, being the only thing in the shape of a missile within reach.\r\n\r\nJack ducked, and the pillow produced a clatter in the washhand-stand\r\namong the crockery, as Jack said,--\r\n\r\n"There\'s a mutiny in the ship, and hark how the cargo clatters; will you\r\nhave it back again?"\r\n\r\n"Come, will you? I\'ve been dreaming, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Dreaming! what\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Thinking of something when you are asleep, you swab."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Jack; "never did such a thing in my life--ha, ha,\r\nha! what\'s the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what\'s the matter. Jack Pringle, you are becoming\r\nmutinous, and I won\'t have it; if you don\'t hold your jaw and draw in\r\nyour slacks, I\'ll have another second."\r\n\r\n"Another second! what\'s in the wind, now?" said Jack. "Is this the\r\ndream?"\r\n\r\n"If ever I dream when I\'m alongside a strange craft, then it is a dream;\r\nbut old Admiral Bell ain\'t the man to sleep when there\'s any work to be\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"That\'s uncommon true," said Jack, turning a quid.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'m going to fight."\r\n\r\n"Fight!" exclaimed Jack. "Avast, there, I don\'t see where\'s the\r\nenemy--none o\' that gammon; Jack Pringle can fight, too, and will lay\r\nalongside his admiral, but he don\'t see the enemy anywhere."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand these things, so I\'ll tell you. I have had a bit\r\nof talk with Sir Francis Varney, and I am going to fight him."\r\n\r\n"What the _wamphigher_?" remarked Jack, parenthetically.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," resumed Jack, "then we shall see another blaze, at least\r\nafore we die; but he\'s an odd fish--one of Davy Jones\'s sort."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care about that; he may be anything he likes; but Admiral Bell\r\nain\'t a-going to have his nephew burned and eaten, and sucked like I\r\ndon\'t know what, by a vampyre, or by any other confounded land-shark."\r\n\r\n"In course," said Jack, "we ain\'t a-going to put up with nothing of that\r\nsort, and if so be as how he has put him out of the way, why it\'s our\r\nduty to send him after him, and square the board."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the thing, Jack; now you know you must go to Sir Francis Varney\r\nand tell him you come from me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if I goes on my own account," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do; I\'ve challenged him and I must fight him."\r\n\r\n"In course you will," returned Jack, "and, if he blows you away, why\r\nI\'ll take your place, and have a blaze myself."\r\n\r\nThe admiral gave a look at Jack of great admiration, and then said,--\r\n\r\n"You are a d----d good seaman, Jack, but he\'s a knight, and might say no\r\nto that, but do you go to him, and tell him that you come from me to\r\nsettle the when and the where this duel is to be fought."\r\n\r\n"Single fight?" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes; consent to any thing that is fair," said the admiral, "but let it\r\nbe as soon as you can. Now, do you understand what I have said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure; I ain\'t lived all these years without knowing your\r\nlingo."\r\n\r\n"Then go at once; and don\'t let the honour of Admiral Bell and old\r\nEngland suffer, Jack. I\'m his man, you know, at any price."\r\n\r\n"Never fear," said Jack; "you shall fight him, at any rate. I\'ll go and\r\nsee he don\'t back out, the warmint."\r\n\r\n"Then go along, Jack; and mind don\'t you go blazing away like a fire\r\nship, and letting everybody know what\'s going on, or it\'ll be stopped."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not spoil sport," said Jack, as he left the room, to go at once to\r\nSir Francis Varney, charged with the conducting of the important cartel\r\nof the admiral. Jack made the best of his way with becoming gravity and\r\nexpedition until he reached the gate of the admiral\'s enemy.\r\n\r\nJack rang loudly at the gate; there seemed, if one might judge by his\r\ncountenance, a something on his mind, that Jack was almost another man.\r\nThe gate was opened by the servant, who inquired what he wanted there.\r\n\r\n"The wamphigher."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"The wamphigher."\r\n\r\nThe servant frowned, and was about to say something uncivil to Jack, who\r\nwinked at him very hard, and then said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, may be you don\'t know him, or won\'t know him by that name: I wants\r\nto see Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"He\'s at home," said the servant; "who are you?"\r\n\r\n"Show me up, then. I\'m Jack Pringle, and I\'m come from Admiral Bell; I\'m\r\nthe Admiral\'s friend, you see, so none of your black looks."\r\n\r\nThe servant seemed amazed, as well as rather daunted, at Jack\'s address;\r\nhe showed him, however, into the hall, where Mr. Chillingworth had just\r\nthat moment arrived, and was waiting for an interview with Varney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nMARCHDALE\'S OFFER.--THE CONSULTATION AT BANNERWORTH HALL.--THE MORNING\r\nOF THE DUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth was much annoyed to see Jack Pringle in the hall, and\r\nJack was somewhat surprised at seeing Mr. Chillingworth there at that\r\ntime in the rooming; they had but little time to indulge in their mutual\r\nastonishment, for a servant came to announce that Sir Francis Varney\r\nwould see them both.\r\n\r\nWithout saying anything to the servant or each other, they ascended the\r\nstaircase, and were shown into the apartment where Sir Francis Varney\r\nreceived them.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Sir Francis, in his usual bland tone, "you are\r\nwelcome."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I have come upon matters of some\r\nimportance; may I crave a separate audience?"\r\n\r\n"And I too," said Jack Pringle; "I come as the friend of Admiral Bell, I\r\nwant a private audience; but, stay, I don\'t care a rope\'s end who knows\r\nwho I am, or what I come about; say you are ready to name time and\r\nplace, and I\'m as dumb as a figure-head; that is saying something, at all\r\nevents; and now I\'m done."\r\n\r\n"Why, gentlemen," said Sir Francis, with a quiet smile, "as you have\r\nboth come upon the same errand, and as there may arise a controversy\r\nupon the point of precedence, you had better be both present, as I must\r\narrange this matter myself upon due inquiry."\r\n\r\n"I do not exactly understand this," said Mr. Chillingworth; "do you, Mr.\r\nPringle? perhaps you can enlighten me?"\r\n\r\n"It," said Jack, "as how you came here upon the same errand as I, and I\r\nas you, why we both come about fighting Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Sir Francis; "what Mr. Pringle says, is, I believe correct\r\nto a letter. I have a challenge from both your principals, and am ready\r\nto give you both the satisfaction you desire, provided the first\r\nencounter will permit me the honour of joining in the second. You, Mr.\r\nPringle, are aware of the chances of war?"\r\n\r\n"I should say so," said Jack, with a wink and a nod of a familiar\r\ncharacter. "I\'ve seen a few of them."\r\n\r\n"Will you proceed to make the necessary agreement between you both,\r\ngentlemen? My affection for the one equals fully the good will I bear\r\nthe other, and I cannot give a preference in so delicate a matter;\r\nproceed gentlemen."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth looked at Jack, and Jack Pringle looked at Mr.\r\nChillingworth, and then the former said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, the admiral means fighting, and I am come to settle the\r\nnecessaries; pray let me know what are your terms, Mr.\r\nWhat-d\'ye-call\'em."\r\n\r\n"I am agreeable to anything that is at all reasonable--pistols, I\r\npresume?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I cannot consent to carry\r\non this office, unless you can appoint a friend who will settle these\r\nmatters with us--myself, at least."\r\n\r\n"And I too," said Jack Pringle; "we don\'t want to bear down an enemy.\r\nAdmiral Bell ain\'t the man to do that, and if he were, I\'m not the man\r\nto back him in doing what isn\'t fair or right; but he won\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"But, gentlemen, this must not be; Mr. Henry Bannerworth must not be\r\ndisappointed, and Admiral Bell must not be disappointed. Moreover, I\r\nhave accepted the two cartels, and I am ready and willing to fight;--one\r\nat a time, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis, after what you have said, I must take upon myself, on the\r\npart of Mr. Henry Bannerworth, to decline meeting you, if you cannot\r\nname a friend with whom I can arrange this affair."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Jack Pringle, "that\'s right enough. I recollect very well\r\nwhen Jack Mizeu fought Tom Foremast, they had their seconds. Admiral\r\nBell can\'t do anything in the dark. No, no, d----e! all must be above\r\nboard."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Sir Francis Varney, "you see the dilemma I am in. Your\r\nprincipals have both challenged me. I am ready to fight any one, or both\r\nof them, as the case may be. Distinctly understand that; because it is a\r\nnotion of theirs that I will not do so, or that I shrink from them; but\r\nI am a stranger in this neighbourhood, and have no one whom I could call\r\nupon to relinquish so much, as they run the risk of doing by attending\r\nme to the field."\r\n\r\n"Then your acquaintances are no friends, d----e!" said Jack Pringle,\r\nspitting through his teeth into the bars of a beautifully polished\r\ngrate. "I\'d stick to anybody--the devil himself, leave alone a\r\nvampyre--if so be as how I had been his friends and drunk grog from the\r\nsame can. They are a set of lubbers."\r\n\r\n"I have not been here long enough to form any such friendships, Mr.\r\nChillingworth; but can confidently rely upon your honour and that of\r\nyour principal, and will freely and fairly meet him."\r\n\r\n"But, Sir Francis, you forget the fact, in transacting, myself for\r\nMr. Bannerworth, and this person or Admiral Bell, we do match, and have\r\nour own characters at stake; nay more, our lives and fortunes. These may\r\nbe small; but they are everything to us. Allow me to say, on my own\r\nbehalf, that I will not permit my principal to meet you unless you can\r\nname a second, as is usual with gentlemen on such occasions."\r\n\r\n"I regret, while I declare to you my entire willingness to meet you,\r\nthat I cannot comply through utter inability to do so, with your\r\nrequest. Let this go forth to the world as I have stated it, and let it\r\nbe an answer to any aspersions that may be uttered as to my\r\nunwillingness to fight."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some moments. Mr. Chillingworth was resolved that,\r\ncome of it what would, he would not permit Henry to fight, unless Sir\r\nFrancis Varney himself should appoint a friend, and then they could meet\r\nupon equal terms.\r\n\r\nJack Pringle whistled, and spit, and chewed and turned his quid--hitched\r\nup his trousers, and looked wistfully from one to the other, as he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"So then it\'s likely to be no fight at all, Sir Francis what\'s-o\'-name?"\r\n\r\n"It seems like it, Mr. Pringle," replied Varney, with a meaning smile;\r\n"unless you can be more complaisant towards myself, and kind towards the\r\nadmiral."\r\n\r\n"Why, not exactly that," said Jack; "it\'s a pity to stop a good play in\r\nthe beginning, just because some little thing is wrong in the tackling."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps your skill and genius may enable us to find some medium course\r\nthat we may pursue with pleasure and profit. What say you, Mr. Pringle?"\r\n\r\n"All I know about genius, as you call it is the Flying Dutchman, or some\r\nsuch odd out of the way fish. But, as I said, I am not one to spoil\r\nsport, nor more is the admiral. Oh, no, we is all true men and good."\r\n\r\n"I believe it," said Varney, bowing politely.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t keep your figure-head on the move; I can see you just as\r\nwell. Howsoever, as I was saying, I don\'t like to spoil sport, and\r\nsooner than both parties should be disappointed, my principal shall\r\nbecome your second, Sir Francis."\r\n\r\n"What, Admiral Bell?" exclaimed Varney, lifting his eyebrows with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"What, Charles Holland\'s uncle!" exclaimed Mr. Chillingworth, in accents\r\nof amazement.\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Jack, with great gravity. "I will pledge my\r\nword--Jack Pringle\'s word--that Admiral Bell shall be second to Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, during his scrimmage with Mr. Henry Bannerworth. That\r\nwill let the matter go on; there can be no back-out then, eh?" continued\r\nJack Pringle, with a knowing nod at Chillingworth as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"That will, I hope, remove your scruples, Mr. Chillingworth," said\r\nVarney, with a courteous smile.\r\n\r\n"But will Admiral Bell do this?"\r\n\r\n"His second says so, and has, I daresay, influence enough with him to\r\ninduce that person to act in conformity with his promise."\r\n\r\n"In course he will. Do you think he would be the man to hang back? Oh,\r\nno; he would be the last to leave Jack Pringle in the lurch--no. Depend\r\nupon it, Sir Francis, he\'ll be as sure to do what I say, as I have said\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"After that assurance, I cannot doubt it," said Sir Francis Varney;\r\n"this act of kindness will, indeed, lay me under a deep and lasting\r\nobligation to Admiral Bell, which I fear I shall never be able to pay."\r\n\r\n"You need not trouble yourself about that," said Jack Pringle; "the\r\nadmiral will credit all, and you can pay off old scores when his turn\r\ncomes in the field."\r\n\r\n"I will not forget," said Varney; "he deserves every consideration; but\r\nnow, Mr. Chillingworth, I presume that we may come to some understanding\r\nrespecting this meeting, which you were so kind as to do me the honour\r\nof seeking."\r\n\r\n"I cannot object to its taking place. I shall be most happy to meet your\r\nsecond in the field, and will arrange with him."\r\n\r\n"I imagine that, under the circumstances, that it will be barely\r\nnecessary to go to that length of ceremony. Future interviews can be\r\narranged later; name the time and place, and after that we can settle\r\nall the rest on the ground."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack; "it will be time enough, surely, to see the admiral\r\nwhen we are upon the ground. I\'ll warrant the old buffer is a true brick\r\nas ever was: there\'s no flinching about him."\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"And I also," said Chillingworth; "but, understand, Sir Francis, any\r\ndefault for seconds makes the meeting a blank."\r\n\r\n"I will not doubt Mr. Pringle\'s honour so much as to believe it\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"I\'m d----d," said Jack, "if you ain\'t a trump-card, and no mistake;\r\nit\'s a great pity as you is a wamphigher."\r\n\r\n"The time, Mr. Chillingworth?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, at seven o\'clock," replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n"The place, sir?"\r\n\r\n"The best place that I can think of is a level meadow half-way between\r\nhere and Bannerworth Hall; but that is your privilege, Sir Francis\r\nVarney."\r\n\r\n"I waive it, and am much obliged to you for the choice of the spot; it\r\nseems of the best character imaginable. I will be punctual."\r\n\r\n"I think we have nothing further to arrange now," said Mr.\r\nChillingworth. "You will meet with Admiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I believe there is nothing more to be done; this affair is\r\nvery satisfactorily arranged, and much better than I anticipated."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Sir Francis," said Mr. Chillingworth. "Good morning."\r\n\r\n"Adieu," said Sir Francis, with a courteous salutation. "Good day, Mr.\r\nPringle, and commend me to the admiral, whose services will be of\r\ninfinite value to me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it," said Jack; "the admiral\'s the man as\'d lend any body\r\na helping hand in case of distress like the present; and I\'ll pledge my\r\nword--Jack Pringle\'s too, as that he\'ll do what\'s right, and give up his\r\nturn to Mr. Henry Bannerworth; cause you see he can have his turn\r\narterwards, you know--it\'s only waiting awhile."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," said Sir Francis.\r\n\r\nJack Pringle made a sea bow and took his leave, as he followed Mr.\r\nChillingworth, and they both left the house together, to return to\r\nBannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I am glad that Sir Francis Varney has\r\ngot over the difficulty of having no seconds; for it would not be proper\r\nor safe to meet a man without a friend for him."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t the right thing," said Jack hitching up his trousers; "but I\r\nwas afeard as how he would back out, and that would be just the wrong\r\nthing for the admiral; he\'d go raving mad."\r\n\r\nThey had got but very few paces from Sir Francis Varney\'s house, when\r\nthey were joined by Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said, as he came up, "I see you have been to Sir Francis\r\nVarney\'s, if I may judge from the direction whence you\'re coming, and\r\nyour proximity."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have," said Mr. Chillingworth. "I thought you had left these\r\nparts?"\r\n\r\n"I had intended to do so," replied Marchdale; "but second thoughts are\r\nsometimes best, you know."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"I have so much friendship for the family at the hall, that\r\nnotwithstanding I am compelled to be absent from the mansion itself, yet\r\nI cannot quit the neighbourhood while there are circumstances of such a\r\ncharacter hanging about them. I will remain, and see if there be not\r\nsomething arising, in which I may be useful to them in some matter."\r\n\r\n"It is very disinterested of you; you will remain here for some time, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, undoubtedly; unless, as I do not anticipate, I should see any\r\noccasion to quit my present quarters."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is," said Jack Pringle; "if you had been here\r\nhalf-an-hour earlier you could have seconded the wamphigher."\r\n\r\n"Seconded!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'re here to challenge."\r\n\r\n"A double challenge?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but in confiding this matter to you, Mr. Marchdale, you will make\r\nno use of it to the exploding of this affair. By so doing you will\r\nseriously damage the honour of Mr. Henry Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"I will not, you may rely upon it; but Mr. Chillingworth, do I not see\r\nyou in the character of a second?"\r\n\r\n"You do, sir."\r\n\r\n"To Mr. Henry?"\r\n\r\n"The same, sir."\r\n\r\n"Have you reflected upon the probable consequences of such an act,\r\nshould any serious mischief occur?"\r\n\r\n"What I have undertaken, Mr. Marchdale, I will go through with; the\r\nconsequences I have duly considered, and yet you see me in the character\r\nof Mr. Henry Bannerworth\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"I am happy to see you as such, and I do not think Henry could find a\r\nbetter. But this is beside the question. What induced me to make the\r\nremark was this,--had I been at the hall, you will admit that Henry\r\nBannerworth would have chosen myself, without any disparagement to you,\r\nMr. Chillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Well sir, what then?"\r\n\r\n"Why I am a single man, I can live, reside and go any where; one country\r\nwill suit me as well as another. I shall suffer no loss, but as for you,\r\nyou will be ruined in every particular; for if you go in the character\r\nof a second, you will not be excused; for all the penalties incurred\r\nyour profession of a surgeon will not excuse you."\r\n\r\n"I see all that, sir."\r\n\r\n"What I propose is, that you should accompany the parties to the field,\r\nbut in your own proper character of surgeon, and permit me to take that\r\nof second to Mr. Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"This cannot be done, unless by Mr. Henry Bannerworth\'s consent," said\r\nMr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Then I will accompany you to Bannerworth Hall, and see Mr. Henry, whom\r\nI will request to permit me to do what I have mentioned to you."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth could not but admit the reasonableness of this\r\nproposal, and it was agreed they should return to Bannerworth Hall in\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nHere they arrived in a very short time after, and entered together.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I will go and bring our two\r\nprincipals, who will be as much astonished to find themselves engaged in\r\nthe same quarrel, as I was to find myself sent on a similar errand to\r\nSir Francis with our friend Mr. John Pringle."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not John--Jack Pringle, you mean," said that individual.\r\n\r\nChillingworth now went in search of Henry, and sent him to the apartment\r\nwhere Mr. Marchdale was with Jack Pringle, and then he found the admiral\r\nwaiting the return of Jack with impatience.\r\n\r\n"Admiral!" he said, "I perceive you are unwell this morning."\r\n\r\n"Unwell be d----d," said the admiral, starting up with surprise. "Who\r\never heard that old admiral Bell looked ill just afore he was going into\r\naction? I say it\'s a scandalous lie."\r\n\r\n"Admiral, admiral, I didn\'t say you were ill; only you looked ill--a--a\r\nlittle nervous, or so. Rather pale, eh? Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"Confound you, do you think I want to be physicked? I tell you, I have\r\nnot a little but a great inclination to give you a good keelhauling. I\r\ndon\'t want a doctor just yet."\r\n\r\n"But it may not be so long, you know, admiral; but there is Jack Pringle\r\na-waiting you below. Will you go to him? There is a particular reason;\r\nhe has something to communicate from Sir Francis Varney, I believe."\r\n\r\nThe admiral gave a look of some amazement at Mr. Chillingworth, and then\r\nhe said, muttering to himself,--\r\n\r\n"If Jack Pringle should have betrayed me--but, no; he could not do that,\r\nhe is too true. I\'m sure of Jack; and how did that son of a gallipot\r\nhint about the odd fish I sent Jack to?"\r\n\r\nFilled with a dubious kind of belief which he had about something he had\r\nheard of Jack Pringle, he entered the room, where he met Marchdale, Jack\r\nPringle, and Henry Bannerworth. Immediately afterwards, Mr.\r\nChillingworth entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n"I have," said he, "been to Sir Francis Varney, and there had an\r\ninterview with him, and with Mr. Pringle; when I found we were both\r\nintent upon the same object, namely, an encounter with the knight by our\r\nprincipals."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Henry; "had he challenged you, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"Challenged me!" exclaimed Admiral Bell, with a round oath.\r\n"I--however--since it comes to this, I must admit I challenged him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I did," said Henry Bannerworth, after a moment\'s thought;\r\n"and I perceive we have both fallen into the same line of conduct."\r\n\r\n"That is the fact," said Mr. Chillingworth. "Both Mr. Pringle and I went\r\nthere to settle the preliminaries, and we found an insurmountable bar to\r\nany meeting taking place at all."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t fight, then?" exclaimed Henry. "I see it all now."\r\n\r\n"Not fight!" said Admiral Bell, with a sort of melancholy\r\ndisappointment. "D--n the cowardly rascal! Tell me, Jack Pringle, what\r\ndid the long horse-marine-looking slab say to it? He told me he would\r\nfight. Why he ought to be made to stand sentry over the wind."\r\n\r\n"You challenged him in person, too, I suppose?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, confound him! I went there last night."\r\n\r\n"And I too."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Marchdale, "that this affair has been not\r\nindiscretely conducted; but somewhat unusually and strangely, to say the\r\nleast of it."\r\n\r\n"You see," said Chillingworth, "Sir Francis was willing to fight both\r\nHenry and the admiral, as he told us."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack; "he told us he would fight us both, if so be as his\r\nlight was not doused in the first brush."\r\n\r\n"That was all that was wanted," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"We could expect no more."\r\n\r\n"But then he desired to meet you without any second; but, of course, I\r\nwould not accede to this proposal. The responsibility was too great and\r\ntoo unequally borne by the parties engaged in the rencontre."\r\n\r\n"Decidedly," said Henry; "but it is unfortunate--very unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Very," said the admiral--"very. What a rascally thing it is there ain\'t\r\nanother rogue in the country to keep him in countenance."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I thought it was a pity to spoil sport," said Jack Pringle. "It was a\r\npity a good intention should be spoiled, and I promised the wamphigher\r\nthat if as how he would fight, you should second him, and you\'d meet him\r\nto do so."\r\n\r\n"Eh! who? I!" exclaimed the admiral in some perplexity.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is the truth," said Mr. Chillingworth. "Mr Pringle said you\r\nwould do so, and he then and there pledged his word that you should meet\r\nhim on the ground and second him."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack "You must do it. I knew you would not spoil sport, and\r\nthat there had better be a fight than no fight. I believe you\'d sooner\r\nsee a scrimmage than none, and so it\'s all arranged."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the admiral, "I only wish Mr. Henry Bannerworth had\r\nbeen his second; I think I was entitled to the first meeting."\r\n\r\n"No," said Jack, "you warn\'t, for Mr. Chillingworth was there first;\r\nfirst come first served, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I mustn\'t grumble at another man\'s luck; mine\'ll come in\r\nturn; but it had better be so than a disappointment altogether; I\'ll be\r\nsecond to this Sir Francis Varney; he shall have fair play, as I\'m an\r\nadmiral; but, d----e he shall fight--yes, yes, he shall fight."\r\n\r\n"And to this conclusion I would come," said Henry, "I wish him to fight;\r\nnow I will take care that he shall not have any opportunity of putting\r\nme on one side quietly."\r\n\r\n"There is one thing," observed Marchdale, "that I wished to propose.\r\nAfter what has passed, I should not have returned, had I not some\r\npresentiment that something was going forward in which I could be useful\r\nto my friend."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the admiral, with a huge twist of his countenance.\r\n\r\n"What I was about to say was this,--Mr. Chillingworth has much to lose\r\nas he is situated, and I nothing as I am placed. I am chained down to no\r\nspot of earth. I am above following a profession--my means, I mean,\r\nplace me above the necessity. Now, Henry, allow me to be your second in\r\nthis affair; allow Mr. Chillingworth to attend in his professional\r\ncapacity; he may be of service--of great service to one of the\r\nprincipals; whereas, if he go in any other capacity, he will inevitably\r\nhave his own safety to consult."\r\n\r\n"That is most unquestionably true," said Henry, "and, to my mind, the\r\nbest plan that can be proposed. What say you, Admiral Bell, will you act\r\nwith Mr. Marchdale in this affair?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I!--Yes--certainly--I don\'t care. Mr. Marchdale is Mr. Marchdale, I\r\nbelieve, and that\'s all I care about. If we quarrel to-day, and have\r\nanything to do to-morrow, in course, to-morrow I can put off my quarrel\r\nfor next day; it will keep,--that\'s all I have to say at present."\r\n\r\n"Then this is a final arrangement?" said Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Bannerworth, in resigning my character of second to Mr.\r\nMarchdale, I only do so because it appears and seems to be the opinion\r\nof all present that I can be much better employed in another capacity."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Mr. Chillingworth; and I cannot but feel that I am under the\r\nsame obligations to you for the readiness and zeal with which you have\r\nacted."\r\n\r\n"I have done what I have done," said Chillingworth, "because I believed\r\nit was my duty to do so."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chillingworth has undoubtedly acted most friendly and efficiently\r\nin this affair," said Marchdale; "and he does not relinquish the part\r\nfor the purpose of escaping a friendly deed, but to perform one in which\r\nhe may act in a capacity that no one else can."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Chillingworth, "you are to meet to-morrow morning in the\r\nmeadow at the bottom of the valley, half way between here and Sir\r\nFrancis Varney\'s house, at seven o\'clock in the morning."\r\n\r\nMore conversation passed among them, and it was agreed that they should\r\nmeet early the next morning, and that, of course, the affair should be\r\nkept a secret.\r\n\r\nMarchdale for that night should remain in the house, and the admiral\r\nshould appear as if little or nothing was the matter; and he and Jack\r\nPringle retired, to talk over in private all the arrangements.\r\n\r\nHenry Bannerworth and Marchdale also retired, and Mr. Chillingworth,\r\nafter a time, retired, promising to be with them in time for the meeting\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nMuch of that day was spent by Henry Bannerworth in his own apartment, in\r\nwriting documents and letters of one kind and another; but at night he\r\nhad not finished, for he had been compelled to be about, and in Flora\'s\r\npresence, to prevent anything from being suspected.\r\n\r\nMarchdale was much with him, and in secret examined the arms,\r\nammunition, and bullets, and saw all was right for the next morning; and\r\nwhen he had done, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Now, Henry, you must permit me to insist that you take some hours\'\r\nrepose, else you will scarcely be as you ought to be."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Henry. "I have just finished, and can take your\r\nadvice."\r\n\r\nAfter many thoughts and reflections, Henry Bannerworth fell into a deep\r\nsleep, and slept several hours in calmness and quietude, and at an early\r\nhour he awoke, and saw Marchdale sitting by him.\r\n\r\n"Is it time, Marchdale? I have not overslept myself, have I?"\r\n\r\n"No; time enough--time enough," said Marchdale. "I should have let you\r\nsleep longer, but I should have awakened you in good time."\r\n\r\nIt was now the grey light of morning, and Henry arose and began to\r\nprepare for the encounter. Marchdale stole to Admiral Bell\'s chamber,\r\nbut he and Jack Pringle were ready.\r\n\r\nFew words were spoken, and those few were in a whisper, and the whole\r\nparty left the Hall in as noiseless a manner as possible. It was a mild\r\nmorning, and yet it was cold at that time of the morning, just as day is\r\nbeginning to dawn in the east. There was, however, ample time to reach\r\nthe rendezvous.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious party that which was now proceeding towards the spot\r\nappointed for the duel, the result of which might have so important an\r\neffect on the interests of those who were to be engaged in it.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for us to analyse the different and conflicting\r\nemotions that filled the breasts of the various individuals composing\r\nthat party--the hopes and fears--the doubts and surmises that were given\r\nutterance to; though we are compelled to acknowledge that though to\r\nHenry, the character of the man he was going to meet in mortal fight was\r\nof a most ambiguous and undefined nature, and though no one could\r\nimagine the means he might be endowed with for protection against the\r\narms of man--Henry, as we said, strode firmly forward with unflinching\r\nresolution. His heart was set on recovering the happiness of his sister,\r\nand he would not falter.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we may consider that at length proceedings of a hostile\r\ncharacter were so far clearly and fairly arranged between Henry\r\nBannerworth and that most mysterious being who certainly, from some\r\ncause or another, had betrayed no inclination to meet an opponent in\r\nthat manner which is sanctioned, bad as it is, by the usages of society.\r\n\r\nBut whether his motive was one of cowardice or mercy, remained yet to be\r\nseen. It might be that he feared himself receiving some mortal injury,\r\nwhich would at once put a stop to that preternatural career of existence\r\nwhich he affected to shudder at, and yet evidently took considerable\r\npains to prolong.\r\n\r\nUpon the other hand, it is just possible that some consciousness of\r\ninvulnerability on his own part, or of great power to injure his\r\nantagonist, might be the cause why he had held back so long from\r\nfighting the duel, and placed so many obstacles in the way of the usual\r\nnecessary arrangements incidental to such occasions.\r\n\r\nNow, however, there would seem to be no possible means of escape. Sir\r\nFrancis Varney must fight or fly, for he was surrounded by too many\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nTo be sure he might have appealed to the civil authorities to protect\r\nhim, and to sanction him in his refusal to commit what undoubtedly is a\r\nlegal offence; but then there cannot be a question that the whole of the\r\ncircumstances would come out, and meet the public eye--the result of\r\nwhich would be, his acquisition of a reputation as unenviable as it\r\nwould be universal.\r\n\r\nIt had so happened, that the peculiar position of the Bannerworth family\r\nkept their acquaintance within extremely narrow limits, and greatly\r\nindisposed them to set themselves up as marks for peculiar observation.\r\n\r\nOnce holding, as they had, a proud position in the county, and being\r\nlooked upon quite as magnates of the land, they did not now court the\r\nprying eye of curiosity to look upon their poverty; but rather with a\r\ngloomy melancholy they lived apart, and repelled the advances of society\r\nby a cold reserve, which few could break through.\r\n\r\nHad this family suffered in any noble cause, or had the misfortunes\r\nwhich had come over them, and robbed their ancestral house of its\r\nlustre, been an unavoidable dispensation of providence, they would have\r\nborne the hard position with a different aspect; but it must be\r\nremembered, that to the faults, the vices, and the criminality of some\r\nof their race, was to be attributed their present depressed state.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen during the progress of our tale, that its action has\r\nbeen tolerably confined to Bannerworth Hall, its adjacent meadows, and\r\nthe seat of Sir Francis Varney; the only person at any distance, knowing\r\nanything of the circumstances, or feeling any interest in them, being\r\nMr. Chillingworth, the surgeon, who, from personal feeling, as well as\r\nfrom professional habit, was not likely to make a family\'s affairs a\r\nsubject of gossip.\r\n\r\nA change, however, was at hand--a change of a most startling and\r\nalarming character to Varney--one which he might expect, yet not be well\r\nprepared for.\r\n\r\nThis period of serenity was to pass away, and he was to become most\r\nalarmingly popular. We will not, however, anticipate, but proceed at\r\nonce to detail as briefly as may be the hostile meeting.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Varney, now that he had once consented to the\r\ndefinitive arrangements of a duel, shrunk not in any way from carrying\r\nthem out, nor in the slightest attempted to retard arrangements which\r\nmight be fatal to himself.\r\n\r\nThe early morning was one of those cloudy ones so frequently occurring\r\nin our fickle climate, when the cleverest weather prophet would find it\r\ndifficult to predict what the next hour might produce.\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of dim gloominess over all objects; and as there were\r\nno bright lights, there were no deep shadows--the consequence of which\r\nwas a sureness of effect over the landscape, that robbed it of many of\r\nits usual beauties.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when Marchdale accompanied Henry and\r\nAdmiral Bell from Bannerworth Hall across the garden in the direction of\r\nthe hilly wood, close to which was the spot intended for the scene of\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nJack Pringle came on at a lazy pace behind with his hands in his\r\npockets, and looking as unconcerned as if he had just come out for a\r\nmorning\'s stroll, and scarcely knew whether he saw what was going on or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe curious contortion into which he twisted his countenance, and the\r\ndifferent odd-looking lumps that appeared in it from time to time, may\r\nbe accounted for by a quid of unusual size, which he seemed to be\r\nmasticating with a relish quite horrifying to one unused to so barbarous\r\na luxury.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had strictly enjoined him not to interfere on pain of being\r\nconsidered a lubber and no seaman for the remainder of his\r\nexistence--threatened penalties which, of course, had their own weight\r\nwith Jack, and accordingly he came just, to see the row in as quiet a\r\nway as possible, perhaps not without a hope, that something might turn\r\nup in the shape of a _causus belli_, that might justify him in adopting\r\na threatening attitude towards somebody.\r\n\r\n"Now, Master Henry," said the admiral, "none of your palaver to me as we\r\ngo along, recollect I don\'t belong to your party, you know. I\'ve stood\r\nfriend to two or three fellows in my time; but if anybody had said to\r\nme, \'Admiral Bell, the next time you go out on a quiet little shooting\r\nparty, it will be as second to a vampyre,\' I\'d have said \'you\'re a liar\'\r\nHowsomever, d--me, here you goes, and what I mean to say is this, Mr\r\nHenry, that I\'d second even a Frenchman rather than he shouldn\'t fight\r\nwhen he\'s asked"\r\n\r\n"That\'s liberal of you," said Henry, "at all event"\r\n\r\n"I believe you it is," said the admiral, "so mind if you don\'t hit him,\r\nI\'m not a-going to tell you how--all you\'ve got to do, is to fire low;\r\nbut that\'s no business of mine. Shiver my timbers, I oughtn\'t to tell\r\nyou, but d--n you, hit him if you can."\r\n\r\n"Admiral," said Henry, "I can hardly think you are even preserving a\r\nneutrality in the matter, putting aside my own partisanship as regards\r\nyour own man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hang him. I\'m not going to let him creep out of the thing on such a\r\nshabby pretence. I can tell you. I think I ought to have gone to his\r\nhouse this morning; only, as I said I never would cross his threshold\r\nagain, I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he\'ll come," said Mr Marchdale to Henry. "After all, you\r\nknow he may take to flight, and shun an encounter which, it is evident,\r\nhe has entered into but tardily."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Henry, "and yet I must own that your supposition has\r\nseveral times crossed my mind. If, however, he do not meet me, he never\r\ncan appear at all in the country, and we should, at least, be rid of\r\nhim, and all his troublesome importunities concerning the Hall. I would\r\nnot allow that man, on any account, to cross the threshold of my house,\r\nas its tenant or its owner."\r\n\r\n"Why, it ain\'t usual," said the admiral, "to let ones house to two\r\npeople at once, unless you seem quite to forget that I\'ve taken yours. I\r\nmay as well remind you of it."\r\n\r\n"Hurra" said Jack Pringle, at this moment.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you? Who told you to hurra?"\r\n\r\n"Enemy in the offing," said Jack, "three or four pints to the sou-west."\r\n\r\n"So he is, by Jove! dodging about among the trees. Come, now, this\r\nvampyre\'s a decenter fellow than I thought him. He means, after all, to\r\nlet us have a pop at him."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached so close to the spot, that Sir Francis Varney, who,\r\nto all appearance, had been waiting, emerged from among the trees,\r\nrolled up in his dismal-looking cloak, and, if possible, looking longer\r\nand thinner than ever he had looked before.\r\n\r\nHis face wore a singular cadaverous looking aspect. His very lips were\r\nwhite and there was a curious, pinkish-looking circle round each of his\r\neyes, that imparted to his whole countenance a most uninviting\r\nappearance. He turned his eyes from one to the other of those who were\r\nadvancing towards him, until he saw the admiral, upon which he gave such\r\na grim and horrible smile, that the old man exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"I say, Jack, you lubber, there\'s a face for a figure head."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see such a d----d grin as that in your life, in any\r\nlatitude?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"You did you swab."\r\n\r\n"I should think so."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie, and you know it."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Jack, "don\'t you recollect when that ere iron bullet\r\nwalked over your head, leaving a nice little nick, all the way off\r\nBergen-ap-Zoom, that was the time--blessed if you didn\'t give just such\r\na grin as that."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t, you rascal."\r\n\r\n"And I say you did."\r\n\r\n"Mutiny, by God!"\r\n\r\n"Go to blazes!"\r\n\r\nHow far this contention might have gone, having now reached its\r\nculminating point, had the admiral and Jack been alone, it is hard to\r\nsay; but as it was, Henry and Marchdale interfered, and so the quarrel\r\nwas patched up for the moment, in order to give place to more important\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nVarney seemed to think, that after the smiling welcome he had given to\r\nhis second, he had done quite enough; for there he stood, tall, and\r\ngaunt, and motionless, if we may except an occasional singular movement\r\nof the mouth, and a clap together of his teeth, at times, which was\r\nenough to make anybody jump to hear.\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake," said Marchdale, "do not let us trifle at such a\r\nmoment as this. Mr. Pringle, you really had no business here."\r\n\r\n"Mr. who?" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Pringle, I believe, is your name?" returned Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"It were; but blowed if ever I was called mister before."\r\n\r\nThe admiral walked up to Sir Francis Varney, and gave him a nod that\r\nlooked much more like one of defiance than of salutation, to which the\r\nvampyre replied by a low, courtly bow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!" muttered the old admiral. "If I was to double up my\r\nbackbone like that, I should never get it down straight again. Well,\r\nall\'s right; you\'ve come; that\'s all you could do, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I am here," said Varney, "and therefore it becomes a work of\r\nsupererogation to remark that I\'ve come."\r\n\r\n"Oh! does it? I never bolted a dictionary, and, therefore, I don\'t know\r\nexactly what you mean."\r\n\r\n"Step aside with me a moment, Admiral Bell, and I will tell you what you\r\nare to do with me after I am shot, if such should be my fate."\r\n\r\n"Do with you! D----d if I\'ll do anything with you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect you will regret me; you will eat."\r\n\r\n"Eat!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and drink as usual, no doubt, notwithstanding being witness to the\r\ndecease of a fellow-creature."\r\n\r\n"Belay there; don\'t call yourself a fellow-creature of mine; I ain\'t a\r\nvampyre."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s no knowing what you may be; and now listen to my\r\ninstructions; for as you\'re my second, you cannot very well refuse to me\r\na few friendly offices. Rain is falling. Step beneath this ancient tree,\r\nand I will talk to you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE STORM AND THE FIGHT.-THE ADMIRAL\'S REPUDIATION OF HIS PRINCIPAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Well," said the admiral, when they were fairly under the tree, upon the\r\nleaves of which the pattering rain might be heard falling: "well--what\r\nis it?"\r\n\r\n"If your young friend, Mr. Bannerworth, should chance to send a\r\npistol-bullet through any portion of my anatomy, prejudicial to the\r\nprolongation of my existence, you will be so good as not to interfere\r\nwith anything I may have about me, or to make any disturbance whatever."\r\n\r\n"You may depend I sha\'n\'t."\r\n\r\n"Just take the matter perfectly easy--as a thing of course."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I mean d----d easy."\r\n\r\n"Ha! what a delightful thing is friendship! There is a little knoll or\r\nmound of earth midway between here and the Hall. Do you happen to know\r\nit? There is one solitary tree glowing near its summit--an oriental\r\nlooking tree, of the fir tribe, which, fan-like, spreads its deep green\r\nleaves; across the azure sky."\r\n\r\n"Oh! bother it; it\'s a d----d old tree, growing upon a little bit of a\r\nhill, I suppose you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely; only much more poetically expressed. The moon rises at a\r\nquarter past four to-night, or rather to-morrow, morning."\r\n\r\n"Does it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and if I should happen to be killed, you will have me removed\r\ngently to this mound of earth, and there laid beneath this tree, with my\r\nface upwards; and take care that it is done before the moon rises. You\r\ncan watch that no one interferes."\r\n\r\n"A likely job. What the deuce do you take me for? I tell you what it is,\r\nMr. Vampyre, or Varney, or whatever\'s your name, if you should chance to\r\nbe hit, where-ever you chance to fall, there you\'ll lie."\r\n\r\n"How very unkind."\r\n\r\n"Uncommon, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, since that is your determination, I must take care of\r\nmyself in another way. I can do so, and I will."\r\n\r\n"Take care of yourself how you like, for all I care; I\'ve come here to\r\nsecond you, and to see that, on the honour of a seaman, if you are put\r\nout of the world, it\'s done in a proper manner, that\'s all I have to do\r\nwith you--now you know."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney looked after him with a strange kind of smile, as he\r\nwalked away to make the necessary preparation with Marchdale for the\r\nimmediate commencement of the contest.\r\n\r\nThese were simple and brief. It was agreed that twelve paces should be\r\nmeasured out, six each way, from a fixed point; one six to be paced by\r\nthe admiral, and the other by Marchdale; then they were to draw lots, to\r\nsee at which end of this imaginary line Varney was to be placed; after\r\nthis the signal for firing was to be one, two, three--fire!\r\n\r\nA few minutes sufficed to complete these arrangements; the ground was\r\nmeasured in the manner we have stated, and the combatants placed in\r\ntheir respective positions, Sir Francis Varney occupying the same spot\r\nwhere he had at first stood, namely, that nearest to the little wood,\r\nand to his own residence.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that under such circumstances the bravest and the\r\ncalmest of mankind could fail to feel some slight degree of tremour or\r\nuneasiness; and, although we can fairly claim for Henry Bannerworth that\r\nhe was as truly courageous as any right feeling Christian man could wish\r\nto be, yet when it was possible that he stood within, as it were, a\r\nhair\'s breadth of eternity, a strange world of sensation and emotions\r\nfound a home in his heart, and he could not look altogether undaunted on\r\nthat future which might, for all he knew to the contrary, be so close at\r\nhand, as far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he feared death, but that he looked with a decent\r\ngravity upon so grave a change as that from this world to the next, and\r\nhence was it that his face was pale, and that he looked all the emotion\r\nwhich he really felt.\r\n\r\nThis was the aspect and the bearing of a brave but not a reckless man;\r\nwhile Sir Francis Varney, on the other hand, seemed, now that he had\r\nfairly engaged in the duel, to look upon it and its attendant\r\ncircumstances with a kind of smirking satisfaction, as if he were far\r\nmore amused than personally interested.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly the more extraordinary after the manner in which he\r\nhad tried to evade the fight, and, at all events, was quite a sufficient\r\nproof that cowardice had not been his actuating motive in so doing.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, who stood on a level with him, could not see the sort of\r\nexpression he wore, or, probably, he would have been far from well\r\npleased; but the others did, and they found something inexpressibly\r\ndisagreeable in the smirking kind of satisfaction with which the vampyre\r\nseemed to regard now the proceedings.\r\n\r\n"Confound him," whispered Marchdale to Henry, "one would think he was\r\nquite delighted, instead, as we had imagined him, not well pleased, at\r\nthese proceedings; look how he grins."\r\n\r\n"It is no matter," said Henry; "let him wear what aspect he may, it is\r\nthe same to me; and, as Heaven is my judge, I here declare, if I did not\r\nthink myself justified in so doing, I would not raise my hand against\r\nthis man."\r\n\r\n"There can be no shadow of a doubt regarding your justification. Have at\r\nhim, and Heaven protect you."\r\n\r\n"Amen!"\r\n\r\nThe admiral was to give the word to fire, and now he and Marshal having\r\nstepped sufficiently on one side to be out of all possible danger from\r\nany stray shot, he commenced repeating the signal,--\r\n\r\n"Are you ready, gentlemen?--once."\r\n\r\nThey looked sternly at each other, and each grasped his pistol.\r\n\r\n"Twice!"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney smiled and looked around him, as if the affair were\r\none of the most common-place description.\r\n\r\n"Thrice!"\r\n\r\nVarney seemed to be studying the sky rather than attending to the duel.\r\n\r\n"Fire!" said the admiral, and one report only struck upon the ear. It\r\nwas that from Henry\'s pistol.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon Sir Francis Varney, who had evidently reserved\r\nhis fire, for what purpose could not be devised, except a murderous one,\r\nthe taking of a more steady aim at Henry.\r\n\r\nSir Francis, however, seemed in no hurry, but smiled significantly, and\r\ngradually raised the point of his weapon.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear the word, Sir Francis? I gave it loud enough, I am sure. I\r\nnever spoke plainer in my life; did I ever, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, often," said Jack Pringle; "what\'s the use of your asking such\r\nyarns as them? you know you have done so often enough when you wanted\r\ngrog."\r\n\r\n"You d----d rascal, I\'ll--I\'ll have your back scored, I will."\r\n\r\n"So you will, when you are afloat again, which you never will be--you\'re\r\npaid off, that\'s certain."\r\n\r\n"You lubberly lout, you ain\'t a seaman; a seaman would never mutiny\r\nagainst his admiral; howsomever, do you hear, Sir Francis, I\'ll give the\r\nmatter up, if you don\'t pay some attention to me."\r\n\r\nHenry looked steadily at Varney, expecting every moment to feel his\r\nbullet. Mr. Marchdale hastily exclaimed that this was not according to\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney took no notice, but went on elevating his weapon;\r\nwhen it was perpendicular to the earth he fired in the air.\r\n\r\n"I had not anticipated this," said Marchdale, as he walked to Henry. "I\r\nthought he was taking a more deadly aim."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Ay, you have escaped, Henry; let me congratulate you."\r\n\r\n"Not so fast; we may fire again."\r\n\r\n"I can afford to do that," he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"You should have fired, sir, according to custom," said the admiral;\r\n"this is not the proper thing."\r\n\r\n"What, fire at your friend?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all very well! You are my friend for a time, vampyre as you\r\nare, and I intend you shall fire."\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Henry Bannerworth demands another fire, I have no objection to\r\nit, and will fire at him; but as it is I shall not do so, indeed, it\r\nwould be quite useless for him to do so--to point mortal weapons at me\r\nis mere child\'s play, they will not hurt me."\r\n\r\n"The devil they won\'t," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Why, look you here," said Sir Francis Varney, stepping forward and\r\nplacing his hand to his neckerchief; "look you here; if Mr. Henry\r\nBannerworth should demand another fire, he may do so with the same\r\nbullet."\r\n\r\n"The same bullet!" said Marchdale, stepping forward--"the same bullet!\r\nHow is this?"\r\n\r\n"My eyes," said Jack; "who\'d a thought it; there\'s a go! Wouldn\'t he do\r\nfor a dummy--to lead a forlorn hope, or to put among the boarders?"\r\n\r\n"Here," said Sir Francis, handing a bullet to Henry Bannerworth--"here\r\nis the bullet you shot at me."\r\n\r\nHenry looked at it--it was blackened by powder; and then Marchdale\r\nseized it and tried it in the pistol, but found the bullet fitted\r\nHenry\'s weapon.\r\n\r\n"By heavens, it is so!" he exclaimed, stepping back and looking at\r\nVarney from top to toe in horror and amazement.\r\n\r\n"D----e," said the admiral, "if I understand this. Why Jack Pringle, you\r\ndog, here\'s a strange fish."\r\n\r\n"On, no! there\'s plenty on \'um in some countries."\r\n\r\n"Will you insist upon another fire, or may I consider you satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"I shall object," said Marchdale. "Henry, this affair must go no\r\nfurther; it would be madness--worse than madness, to fight upon such\r\nterms."\r\n\r\n"So say I," said the admiral. "I will not have anything to do with you,\r\nSir Francis. I\'ll not be your second any longer. I didn\'t bargain for\r\nsuch a game as this. You might as well fight with the man in brass\r\narmour, at the Lord Mayor\'s show, or the champion at a coronation."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Jack Pringle; "a man may as well fire at the back of a\r\nhalligator as a wamphigher."\r\n\r\n"This must be considered as having been concluded," said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"No!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"And wherefore not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have not received his fire."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid you should."\r\n\r\n"I may not with honour quit the ground without another fire."\r\n\r\n"Under ordinary circumstances there might be some shadow of an excuse\r\nfor your demand; but as it is there is none. You have neither honour nor\r\ncredit to gain by such an encounter, and, certainly, you can gain no\r\nobject."\r\n\r\n"How are we to decide this affair? Am I considered absolved from the\r\naccusation under which I lay, of cowardice?" inquired Sir Francis\r\nVarney, with a cold smile.\r\n\r\n"Why, as for that," said the admiral, "I should as soon expect credit\r\nfor fighting behind a wall, as with a man that I couldn\'t hit any more\r\nthan the moon."\r\n\r\n"Henry; let me implore you to quit this scene; it can do no good."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a noise, as of human voices, was heard at a distance;\r\nthis caused a momentary pause, and, the whole party stood still and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nThe murmurs and shouts that now arose in the distance were indistinct\r\nand confused.\r\n\r\n"What can all this mean?" said Marchdale; "there is something very\r\nstrange about it. I cannot imagine a cause for so unusual an\r\noccurrence."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Sir Francis Varney, looking suspiciously at Henry\r\nBannerworth.\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour I know neither what is the cause nor the nature of the\r\nsounds themselves."\r\n\r\n"Then we can easily see what is the matter from yonder hillock," said\r\nthe admiral; "and there\'s Jack Pringle, he\'s up there already. What\'s he\r\ntelegraphing about in that manner, I wonder?"\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Jack Pringle, hearing the riot, had thought that if he got\r\nto the neighbouring eminence he might possibly ascertain what it was\r\nthat was the cause of what he termed the "row," and had succeeded in\r\nsome degree.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of people of all kinds coming out from the village,\r\napparently armed, and shouting. Jack Pringle hitched up his trousers and\r\nswore, then took off his hat and began to shout to the admiral, as he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"D----e, they are too late to spoil the sport. Hilloa! hurrah!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that about, Jack?" inquired the admiral, as he came puffing\r\nalong. "What\'s the squall about?"\r\n\r\n"Only a few horse-marines and bumboat-women, that have been startled\r\nlike a company of penguins."\r\n\r\n"Oh! my eyes! wouldn\'t a whole broadside set \'em flying, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Ay; just as them Frenchmen that you murdered on board the Big\r\nThunderer, as you called it."\r\n\r\n"I murder them, you rascal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; there was about five hundred of them killed."\r\n\r\n"They were only shot."\r\n\r\n"They were killed, only your conscience tells you it\'s uncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"You rascal--you villain! You ought to be keel-hauled and well payed."\r\n\r\n"Ay; you\'re payed, and paid off as an old hulk."\r\n\r\n"D----e--you--you--oh! I wish I had you on board ship, I\'d make your\r\nlubberly carcass like a union jack, full of red and blue stripes."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s all very well; but if you don\'t take to your heels, you\'ll\r\nhave all the old women in the village a whacking on you, that\'s all I\r\nhave to say about it. You\'d better port your helm and about ship, or\r\nyou\'ll be keel-hauled."\r\n\r\n"D--n your--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" inquired Marchdale, as he arrived.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the cause of all the noise we have heard?" said Sir Francis;\r\n"has some village festival spontaneously burst forth among the rustics\r\nof this place?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell the cause of it," said Henry Bannerworth; "but they seem\r\nto me to be coming towards this place."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I think so too," said Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"With what object?" inquired Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"No peaceable one," observed Henry; "for, as far I can observe, they\r\nstruck across the country, as though they would enclose something, or\r\nintercept somebody."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! but why come here?"\r\n\r\n"If I knew that I could have at once told the cause."\r\n\r\n"And they appear armed with a variety of odd weapons," observed Sir\r\nFrancis; "they mean an attack upon some one! Who is that man with them?\r\nhe seems to be deprecating their coming."\r\n\r\n"That appears to be Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry; "I think that is\r\nhe."\r\n\r\n"Yes," observed the admiral; "I think I know the build of that craft;\r\nhe\'s been in our society before. I always know a ship as soon as I see\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Does you, though?" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yea; what do you mean, eh? let me hear what you\'ve got to say against\r\nyour captain and your admiral, you mutinous dog; you tell me, I say."\r\n\r\n"So I will; you thought you were fighting a big ship in a fog, and fired\r\na dozen broadsides or so, and it was only the Flying Dutchman, or the\r\ndevil."\r\n\r\n"You infernal dog--"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know it was; it might a been our own shadow for all I can\r\ntell. Indeed, I think it was."\r\n\r\n"You think!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s mutiny; I\'ll have no more to do with you, Jack Pringle; you\'re\r\nno seaman, and have no respect for your officer. Now sheer off, or I\'ll\r\ncut your yards."\r\n\r\n"Why, as for my yards, I\'ll square \'em presently if I like, you old\r\nswab; but as for leaving you, very well; you have said so, and you shall\r\nbe accommodated, d----e; however, it was not so when your nob was nearly\r\nrove through with a boarding pike; it wasn\'t \'I\'ll have no more to do\r\nwith Jack Pringle\' then, it was more t\'other."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, why be so mutinous?"\r\n\r\n"Because you aggrawates me."\r\n\r\nThe cries of the mob became more distinct as they drew nearer to the\r\nparty, who began to evince some uneasiness as to their object.\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Marchdale, "Mr. Chillingworth has not named anything\r\nrespecting the duel that has taken place."\r\n\r\n"No, no."\r\n\r\n"But he was to have been here this morning," said the admiral. "I\r\nunderstood he was to be here in his own character of a surgeon, and yet\r\nI have not seen him; have any of you?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Then here he comes in the character of conservator of the public\r\npeace," said Varney, coldly; "however, I believe that his errand will be\r\nuseless since the affair is, I presume, concluded."\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Eh!" said the admiral, "eh, what\'s that, eh? What did they say?"\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll listen they\'ll tell you soon enough, I\'ll warrant."\r\n\r\n"May be they will, and yet I\'d like to know now."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney looked significantly at Marchdale, and then waited\r\nwith downcast eyes for the repetition of the words.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" resounded on all sides from the people who came\r\nrapidly towards them, and converging towards a centre. "Burn, destroy,\r\nand kill the vampyre! No vampyre; burn him out; down with him; kill\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen came Mr. Chillingworth\'s voice, who, with much earnestness,\r\nendeavoured to exhort them to moderation, and to refrain from violence.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney became very pale agitated; he immediately turned, and\r\ntaking the least notice, he made for the wood, which lay between him and\r\nhis own house, leaving the people in the greatest agitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Marchdale was not unmoved at this occurrence, but stood his ground\r\nwith Henry Bannerworth, the admiral, and Jack Pringle, until the mob\r\ncame very near to them, shouting, and uttering cries of vengeance, and\r\ndeath of all imaginable kinds that it was possible to conceive, against\r\nthe unpopular vampyre.\r\n\r\nPending the arrival of these infuriated persons, we will, in a few\r\nwords, state how it was that so suddenly a set of circumstances arose\r\nproductive of an amount of personal danger to Varney, such as, up to\r\nthat time, had seemed not at all likely to occur.\r\n\r\nWe have before stated there was but one person out of the family of the\r\nBannerworths who was able to say anything of a positive character\r\nconcerning the singular and inexplicable proceedings at the Hall; and\r\nthat that person was Mr. Chillingworth, an individual not at all likely\r\nto become garrulous upon the subject.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the best of men have their weaknesses, and we much regret to\r\nsay that Mr. Chillingworth so far in this instance forgot that admirable\r\ndiscretion which commonly belonged to him, as to be the cause of the\r\npopular tumult which had now readied such a height.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of thoughtlessness and confidence, he told his wife. Yes,\r\nthis really clever man, from whom one would not have expected such a\r\npiece of horrible indiscretion, actually told his wife all about the\r\nvampyre. But such is human nature; combined with an amount of firmness\r\nand reasoning power, that one would have thought to be invulnerable\r\nsafeguards, we find some weakness which astonishes all calculation.\r\n\r\nSuch was this of Mr. Chillingworth\'s. It is true, he cautioned the lady\r\nto be secret, and pointed to her the danger of making Varney the vampyre\r\na theme for gossip; but he might as well have whispered to a hurricane\r\nto be so good as not to go on blowing so, as request Mrs. Chillingworth\r\nto keep a secret.\r\n\r\nOf course she burst into the usual fervent declarations of "Who was she\r\nto tell? Was she a person who went about telling things? When did she\r\nsee anybody? Not she, once in a blue moon;" and then, when Mr.\r\nChillingworth went out, like the King of Otaheite, she invited the\r\nneighbours round about to come to take some tea.\r\n\r\nUnder solemn promises of secrecy, sixteen ladies that evening were made\r\nacquainted with the full and interesting particulars of the attack of\r\nthe vampyre on Flora Bannerworth, and all the evidence inculpating Sir\r\nFrancis Varney as the blood-thirsty individual.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind comes to consider that these sixteen ladies multiplied\r\ntheir information by about four-and-twenty each, we become quite lost in\r\na sea of arithmetic, and feel compelled to sum up the whole by a candid\r\nassumption that in four-and-twenty hours not an individual in the whole\r\ntown was ignorant of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the morning before the projected duel, there was an unusual commotion\r\nin the streets. People were conversing together in little knots, and\r\nusing rather violent gesticulations. Poor Mr. Chillingworth! he alone\r\nwas ignorant of the causes of the popular commotion, and so he went to\r\nbed wondering that an unusual bustle pervaded the little market town,\r\nbut not at all guessing its origin.\r\n\r\nSomehow or another, however, the populace, who had determined to make a\r\ndemonstration on the following morning against the vampyre, thought it\r\nhighly necessary first to pay some sort of compliment to Mr.\r\nChillingworth, and, accordingly, at an early hour, a great mob assembled\r\noutside his house, and gave three terrific applauding shouts, which\r\nroused him most unpleasantly from his sleep; and induced the greatest\r\nastonishment at the cause of such a tumult.\r\n\r\nOh, that artful Mrs. Chillingworth! too well she knew what was the\r\nmatter; yet she pretended to be so oblivious upon the subject.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" cried Mr. Chillingworth, as he started up in bed, "what\'s\r\nall that?"\r\n\r\n"All what?" said his wife.\r\n\r\n"All what! Do you mean to say you heard nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think I did hear a little sort of something."\r\n\r\n"A little sort of something? It shook the house."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; never mind. Go to sleep again; it\'s no business of ours."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it may be, though. It\'s all very well to say \'go to sleep.\'\r\nThat happens to be a thing I can\'t do. There\'s something amiss."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s that to you?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps nothing; but, perhaps, everything."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth sprang from his bed, and began dressing, a process\r\nwhich he executed with considerable rapidity, and in which he was much\r\naccelerated by two or three supplementary shouts from the people below.\r\n\r\nThen, in a temporary lull, a loud voice shouted,--\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre--down with the vampyre!"\r\n\r\nThe truth in an instant burst over the mind of Mr. Chillingworth; and,\r\nturning to his wife, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"I understand it now. You\'ve been gossipping about Sir Francis Varney,\r\nand have caused all this tumult."\r\n\r\n"I gossip! Well, I never! Lay it on me; it\'s sure to be my fault. I\r\nmight have known that beforehand. I always am."\r\n\r\n"But you must have spoken of it."\r\n\r\n"Who have I got to speak to about it?"\r\n\r\n"Did you, or did you not?"\r\n\r\n"Who should I tell?"\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth was dressed, and he hastened down and entered the\r\nstreet with great desperation. He had a hope that he might be enabled to\r\ndisperse the crowd, and yet be in time to keep his appointment at the\r\nduel.\r\n\r\nHis appearance was hailed with another shout, for it was considered, of\r\ncourse, that he had come to join in the attack upon Sir Francis Varney.\r\nHe found assembled a much more considerable mob than he had imagined,\r\nand to his alarm he found many armed with all sorts of weapons of\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" cried a great lumpy-looking fellow, who seemed half mad with\r\nthe prospect of a disturbance. "Hurrah! here\'s the doctor, he\'ll tell us\r\nall about it as we go along. Come on."\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake," said Mr. Chillingworth, "stop; What are you about\r\nto do all of you?"\r\n\r\n"Burn the vampyre--burn the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Hold--hold! this is folly. Let me implore you all to return to your\r\nhomes, or you will get into serious trouble on this subject."\r\n\r\nThis was a piece of advice not at all likely to be adopted; and when the\r\nmob found that Mr. Chillingworth was not disposed to encourage and\r\ncountenance it in its violence, it gave another loud shout of defiance,\r\nand moved off through the long straggling streets of the town in a\r\ndirection towards Sir Francis Varney\'s house.\r\n\r\nIt is true that what were called the authorities of the town had become\r\nalarmed, and were stirring, but they found themselves in such a\r\nfrightful minority, that it became out of the question for them to\r\ninterfere with any effect to stop the lawless proceedings of the\r\nrioters, so that the infuriated populace had it all their own way, and\r\nin a straggling, disorderly-looking kind of procession they moved off,\r\nvowing vengeance as they went against Varney the vampyre.\r\n\r\nHopeless as Mr. Chillingworth thought it was to interfere with any\r\ndegree of effect in the proceedings of the mob, he still could not\r\nreconcile it to himself to be absent from a scene which he now felt\r\ncertain had been produced by his own imprudence, so he went on with the\r\ncrowd, endeavouring, as he did so, by every argument that could be\r\nsuggested to him to induce them to abstain from the acts of violence\r\nthey contemplated. He had a hope, too, that when they reached Sir\r\nFrancis Varney\'s, finding him not within, as probably would be the case,\r\nas by that time he would have started to meet Henry Bannerworth on the\r\nground, to fight the duel, he might induce the mob to return and forego\r\ntheir meditated violence.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was it that, urged on by a multitude of persons, the unhappy\r\nsurgeon was expiating, both in mind and person, the serious mistakes he\r\nhad committed in trusting a secret to his wife.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that we for one moment wish to lay down a general\r\nprinciple as regards the confiding secrets to ladies, because from the\r\nbeginning of the world it has become notorious how well they keep them,\r\nand with what admirable discretion, tact, and forethought this fairest\r\nportion of humanity conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nWe know how few Mrs. Chillingworths there are in the world, and have but\r\nto regret that our friend the doctor should, in his matrimonial\r\nadventure, have met with such a specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE POPULAR RIOT.--SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S DANGER.--THE SUGGESTION AND ITS\r\nRESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the circumstances which at once altered the whole\r\naspect of the affairs, and, from private and domestic causes of very\r\ndeep annoyance, led to public results of a character which seemed likely\r\nto involve the whole country-side in the greatest possible confusion.\r\n\r\nBut while we blame Mr. Chillingworth for being so indiscreet as to\r\ncommunicate the secret of such a person as Varney the vampyre to his\r\nwife, we trust in a short time to be enabled to show that he made as\r\nmuch reparation as it was possible to make for the mischief he had\r\nunintentionally committed. And now as he struggled onward--apparently\r\nonward--first and foremost among the rioters, he was really doing all in\r\nhis power to quell that tumult which superstition and dread had raised.\r\n\r\nHuman nature truly delights in the marvellous, and in proportion as a\r\nknowledge of the natural phenomena of nature is restricted, and\r\nunbridled imagination allowed to give the rein to fathomless conjecture,\r\nwe shall find an eagerness likewise to believe the marvellous to be the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThat dim and uncertain condition concerning vampyres, originating\r\nprobably as it had done in Germany, had spread itself slowly, but\r\ninsidiously, throughout the whole of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn no country and in no clime is there not something which bears a kind\r\nof family relationship to the veritable vampyre of which Sir Francis\r\nVarney appeared to be so choice a specimen.\r\n\r\nThe _ghoul_ of eastern nations is but the same being, altered to suit\r\nhabits and localities; and the _sema_ of the Scandinavians is but the\r\nvampyre of a more primitive race, and a personification of that morbid\r\nimagination which has once fancied the probability of the dead walking\r\nagain among the living, with all the frightful insignia of corruption\r\nand the grave about them.\r\n\r\nAlthough not popular in England, still there had been tales told of such\r\nmidnight visitants, so that Mrs. Chillingworth, when she had imparted\r\nthe information which she had obtained, had already some rough material\r\nto work upon in the minds of her auditors, and therefore there was no\r\ngreat difficulty in very soon establishing the fact.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, ignorant people always do what they have heard\r\nhas been done by some one else before them and in an incredibly short\r\nspace of time the propriety of catching Sir Francis Varney, depriving\r\nhim of his vampyre-like existence, and driving a stake through his body,\r\nbecame not at all a questionable proposition.\r\n\r\nAlas, poor Mr. Chillingworth! as well might he have attempted King\r\nCanute\'s task of stemming the waves of the ocean as that of attempting\r\nto stop the crowd from proceeding to Sir Francis Varney\'s house.\r\n\r\nHis very presence was a sort of confirmation of the whole affair. In\r\nvain he gesticulated, in vain he begged and prayed that they would go\r\nback, and in vain he declared that full and ample justice should be done\r\nupon the vampyre, provided popular clamour spared him, and he was left\r\nto more deliberate judgment.\r\n\r\nThose who were foremost in the throng paid no attention to these\r\nremonstrances while those who were more distant heard them not, and, for\r\nall they knew, he might be urging the crowd on to violence, instead of\r\ndeprecating it.\r\n\r\nThus, then, this disorderly rabble soon reached the house of Sir Francis\r\nVarney and loudly demanded of his terrified servant where he was to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe knocking at the Hall door was prodigious, and, with a laudable\r\ndesire, doubtless, of saving time, the moment one was done amusing\r\nhimself with the ponderous knocker, another seized it; so that until the\r\ndoor was flung open by some of the bewildered and terrified men, there\r\nwas no cessation whatever of the furious demands for admittance.\r\n\r\n"Varney the vampyre--Varney the vampyre!" cried a hundred voices. "Death\r\nto the vampyre! Where is he? Bring him out. Varney the vampyre!"\r\n\r\nThe servants were too terrified to speak for some moments, as they saw\r\nsuch a tumultuous assemblage seeking their master, while so singular a\r\nname was applied to him. At length, one more bold than the rest\r\ncontrived to stammer out,--\r\n\r\n"My good people, Sir Francis Varney is not at home. He took an early\r\nbreakfast, and has been out nearly an hour."\r\n\r\nThe mob paused a moment in indecision, and then one of the foremost\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n"Who\'d suppose they\'d own he was at home? He\'s hiding somewhere of\r\ncourse; let\'s pull him out."\r\n\r\n"Ah, pull him out--pull him out!" cried many voices. A rush was made\r\ninto the hall and in a very few minutes its chambers were ransacked, and\r\nall its hidden places carefully searched, with the hope of discovering\r\nthe hidden form of Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nThe servants felt that, with their inefficient strength, to oppose the\r\nproceedings of an assemblage which seemed to be unchecked by all sort of\r\nlaw or reason, would be madness; they therefore only looked on, with\r\nwonder and dismay, satisfied certainly in their own minds that Sir\r\nFrancis would not be found, and indulging in much conjecture as to what\r\nwould be the result of such violent and unexpected proceedings.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth hoped that time was being gained, and that some sort\r\nof indication of what was going on would reach the unhappy object of\r\npopular detestation sufficiently early to enable him to provide for his\r\nown safety.\r\n\r\nHe knew he was breaking his own engagement to be present at the duel\r\nbetween Henry Bannerworth and Sir Francis Varney, and, as that thought\r\nrecurred to him, he dreaded that his professional services might be\r\nrequired on one side or the other; for he knew, or fancied he knew, that\r\nmutual hatred dictated the contest; and he thought that if ever a duel\r\nhad taken place which was likely to be attended with some disastrous\r\nresult, that was surely the one.\r\n\r\nBut how could he leave, watched and surrounded as he was by an\r\ninfuriated multitude--how could he hope but that his footsteps would be\r\ndogged, or that the slightest attempt of his to convey a warning to Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, would not be the means of bringing down upon his head\r\nthe very danger he sought to shield him from.\r\n\r\nIn this state of uncertainty, then, did our medical man remain, a prey\r\nto the bitterest reflections, and full of the direst apprehensions,\r\nwithout having the slightest power of himself to alter so disastrous a\r\ntrain of circumstances.\r\n\r\nDissatisfied with their non-success, the crowd twice searched the house\r\nof Sir Francis Varney, from the attics to the basement; and then, and\r\nnot till then, did they begin reluctantly to believe that the servants\r\nmust have spoken the truth.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the town somewhere," cried one. "Let\'s go back to the town."\r\n\r\nIt is strange how suddenly any mob will obey any impulse, and this\r\nperfectly groundless supposition was sufficient to turn their steps back\r\nagain in the direction whence they came, and they had actually, in a\r\nstraggling sort of column, reached halfway towards the town, when they\r\nencountered a boy, whose professional pursuit consisted in tending sheep\r\nvery early of a morning, and who at once informed them that he had seen\r\nSir Francis Varney in the wood, half way between Bannerworth Hall and\r\nhis own home.\r\n\r\nThis event at once turned the whole tide again, and with renewed\r\nclamours, carrying Mr. Chillingworth along with them, they now rapidly\r\nneared the real spot, where, probably, had they turned a little earlier,\r\nthey would have viewed the object of their suspicion and hatred.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have already recorded, the advancing throng was seen by the\r\nparties on the ground, where the duel could scarcely have been said to\r\nhave been fought; and then had Sir Francis Varney dashed into the wood,\r\nwhich was so opportunely at hand to afford him a shelter from his\r\nenemies, and from the intricacies of which--well acquainted with them as\r\nhe doubtless was,--he had every chance of eluding their pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair was a great surprise to Henry and his friends, when\r\nthey saw such a string of people advancing, with such shouts and\r\nimprecations; they could not, for the life of them, imagine what could\r\nhave excited such a turn out among the ordinarily industrious and quiet\r\ninhabitants of a town, remarkable rather for the quietude and steadiness\r\nof its population, than for any violent outbreaks of popular feeling.\r\n\r\n"What can Mr. Chillingworth be about," said Henry, "to bring such a mob\r\nhere? has he taken leave of his senses?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Marchdale; "look again; he seems to be trying to keep them\r\nback, although ineffectually, for they will not be stayed."\r\n\r\n"D----e," said the admiral, "here\'s a gang of pirates; we shall be\r\nboarded and carried before we know where we are, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Ay ay, sir," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"And is that all you\'ve got to say, you lubber, when you see your\r\nadmiral in danger? You\'d better go and make terms with the enemy at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Really, this is serious," said Henry; "they shout for Varney. Can Mr.\r\nChillingworth have been so mad as to adopt this means of stopping the\r\nduel?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible," said Marchdale; "if that had been his intention, he could\r\nhave done so quietly, through the medium of the civil authorities."\r\n\r\n"Hang me!" exclaimed the admiral, "if there are any civil authorities;\r\nthey talk of smashing somebody. What do they say, Jack? I don\'t hear\r\nquite so well as I used."\r\n\r\n"You always was a little deaf," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"A little deaf, I say."\r\n\r\n"Why, you lubberly lying swab, how dare you say so?"\r\n\r\n"Because you was."\r\n\r\n"You slave-going scoundrel!"\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, do not quarrel at such a time as this!" said Henry;\r\n"we shall be surrounded in a moment. Come, Mr. Marchdale, let you and I\r\nvisit these people, and ascertain what it is that has so much excited\r\ntheir indignation."\r\n\r\n"Agreed," said Marchdale; and they both stepped forward at a rapid pace,\r\nto meet the advancing throng.\r\n\r\nThe crowd which had now approached to within a short distance of the\r\nexpectant little party, was of a most motley description, and its\r\nappearance, under many circumstances, would cause considerable\r\nrisibility. Men and women were mixed indiscriminately together, and in\r\nthe shouting, the latter, if such a thing were possible, exceeded the\r\nformer, both in discordance and energy.\r\n\r\nEvery individual composing that mob carried some weapon calculated for\r\ndefence, such as flails, scythes, sickles, bludgeons, &c., and this mode\r\nof arming caused them to wear a most formidable appearance; while the\r\npassion that superstition had called up was strongly depicted in their\r\ninflamed features. Their fury, too, had been excited by their\r\ndisappointment, and it was with concentrated rage that they now pressed\r\nonward.\r\n\r\nThe calm and steady advance of Henry and Mr. Marchdale to meet the\r\nadvancing throng, seemed to have the effect of retarding their progress\r\na little, and they came to a parley at a hedge, which separated them\r\nfrom the meadow in which the duel had been fought.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be advancing towards us," said Henry. "Do you seek me or\r\nany of my friends; and if so, upon what errand? Mr. Chillingworth, for\r\nHeaven\'s sake, explain what is the cause of all this assault. You seem\r\nto be at the head of it."\r\n\r\n"Seem to be," said Mr. Chillingworth, "without being so. You are not\r\nsought, nor any of your friends?"\r\n\r\n"Who, then?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney," was the immediate reply.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! and what has he done to excite popular indignation? of private\r\nwrong I can accuse him; but I desire no crowd to take up my cause, or to\r\navenge my quarrels."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bannerworth, it has become known, through my indiscretion, that Sir\r\nFrancis Varney is suspected of being a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Is this so?"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob. "Down with the vampyre! hurrah! where is he?\r\nDown with him!"\r\n\r\n"Drive a stake through him," said a woman; "it\'s the only way, and the\r\nhumanest. You\'ve only to take a hedge stake and sharpen it a bit at one\r\nend, and char it a little in the fire so as there mayt\'n\'t be no\r\nsplinters to hurt, and then poke it through his stomach."\r\n\r\nThe mob gave a great shout at this humane piece of advice, and it was\r\nsome time before Henry could make himself heard at all, even to those\r\nwho were nearest to him.\r\n\r\nWhen he did succeed in so doing, he cried, with a loud voice,--\r\n\r\n"Hear me, all of you. It is quite needless for me to inquire how you\r\nbecame possessed of the information that a dreadful suspicion hangs over\r\nthe person of Sir Francis Varney; but if, in consequence of hearing such\r\nnews, you fancy this public demonstration will be agreeable to me, or\r\nlikely to relieve those who are nearest or dearest to me from the state\r\nof misery and apprehension into which they have fallen, you are much\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"Hear him, hear him!" cried Mr. Marchdale; "he speaks both wisdom and\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"If anything," pursued Henry, "could add to the annoyance of vexation\r\nand misery we have suffered, it would assuredly be the being made\r\nsubjects of every-day gossip, and every-day clamour."\r\n\r\n"You hear him?" said Mr. Marchdale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we does," said a man; "but we comes out to catch a vampyre, for\r\nall that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to be sure," said the humane woman; "nobody\'s feelings is nothing\r\nto us. Are we to be woke up in the night with vampyres sucking our\r\nbloods while we\'ve got a stake in the country?"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted everybody. "Down with the vampyre! where is he?"\r\n\r\n"You are wrong. I assure you, you are all wrong," said Mr.\r\nChillingworth, imploringly; "there is no vampyre here, you see. Sir\r\nFrancis Varney has not only escaped, but he will take the law of all of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThis was an argument which appeared to stagger a few, but the bolder\r\nspirits pushed them on, and a suggestion to search the wood having been\r\nmade by some one who was more cunning than his neighbours, that measure\r\nwas at once proceeded with, and executed in a systematic manner, which\r\nmade those who knew it to be the hiding-place of Sir Francis Varney\r\ntremble for his safety.\r\n\r\nIt was with a strange mixture of feeling that Henry Bannerworth waited\r\nthe result of the search for the man who but a few minutes before had\r\nbeen opposed to him in a contest of life or death.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Sir Francis Varney would certainly have been an\r\neffectual means of preventing him from continuing to be the incubus he\r\nthen was upon the Bannerworth family; and yet the generous nature of\r\nHenry shrank with horror from seeing even such a creature as Varney\r\nsacrificed at the shrine of popular resentment, and murdered by an\r\ninfuriated populace.\r\n\r\nHe felt as great an interest in the escape of the vampyre as if some\r\ngreat advantage to himself had been contingent upon such an event; and,\r\nalthough he spoke not a word, while the echoes of the little wood were\r\nall awakened by the clamorous manner in which the mob searched for their\r\nvictim, his feelings could be well read upon his countenance.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, too, without possessing probably the fine feelings of Henry\r\nBannerworth, took an unusually sympathetic interest in the fate of the\r\nvampyre; and, after placing himself in various attitudes of intense\r\nexcitement, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"D--n it, Jack, I do hope, after all, the vampyre will get the better of\r\nthem. It\'s like a whole flotilla attacking one vessel--a lubberly\r\nproceeding at the best, and I\'ll be hanged if I like it. I should like\r\nto pour in a broadside into those fellows, just to let them see it\r\nwasn\'t a proper English mode of fighting. Shouldn\'t you, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir, I should."\r\n\r\n"Shiver me, if I see an opportunity, if I don\'t let some of those\r\nrascals know what\'s what."\r\n\r\nScarcely had these words escaped the lips of the old admiral than there\r\narose a loud shout from the interior of the wood. It was a shout of\r\nsuccess, and seemed at the very least to herald the capture of the\r\nunfortunate Varney.\r\n\r\n"By Heaven!" exclaimed Henry, "they have him."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said Mr. Marchdale; "this grows too serious."\r\n\r\n"Bear a hand, Jack," said the admiral: "we\'ll have a fight for it yet;\r\nthey sha\'n\'t murder even a vampyre in cold blood. Load the pistols and\r\nsend a flying shot or two among the rascals, the moment they appear."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Henry; "no more violence, at least there has been\r\nenough--there has been enough."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke there came rushing from among the trees, at the corner\r\nof the wood, the figure of a man. There needed but one glance to assure\r\nthem who it was. Sir Francis Varney had been seen, and was flying before\r\nthose implacable foes who had sought his life.\r\n\r\nHe had divested himself of his huge cloak, as well as of his low\r\nslouched hat, and, with a speed which nothing but the most absolute\r\ndesperation could have enabled him to exert, he rushed onward, beating\r\ndown before him every obstacle, and bounding over the meadows at a rate\r\nthat, if he could have continued it for any length of time, would have\r\nset pursuit at defiance.\r\n\r\n"Bravo!" shouted the admiral, "a stern chase is a long chase, and I wish\r\nthem joy of it--d----e, Jack, did you ever see anybody get along like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"You never did, you scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did."\r\n\r\n"When and where?"\r\n\r\n"When you ran away off the sound."\r\n\r\nThe admiral turned nearly blue with anger, but Jack looked perfectly\r\nimperturbable, as he added,--\r\n\r\n"You know you ran away after the French frigates who wouldn\'t stay to\r\nfight you."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that indeed. There he goes, putting on every stitch of canvass,\r\nI\'ll be bound."\r\n\r\n"And there they come," said Jack, as he pointed to the corner of the\r\nwood, and some of the more active of the vampyre\'s pursuers showed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt would appear as if the vampyre had been started from some\r\nhiding-place in the interior of the wood, and had then thought it\r\nexpedient altogether to leave that retreat, and make his way to some\r\nmore secure one across the open country, where there would be more\r\nobstacles to his discovery than perseverance could overcome. Probably,\r\nthen, among the brushwood and trees, for a few moments he had been again\r\nlost sight of, until those who were closest upon his track had emerged\r\nfrom among the dense foliage, and saw him scouring across the country at\r\nsuch headlong speed. These were but few, and in their extreme anxiety\r\nthemselves to capture Varney, whose precipate and terrified flight\r\nbrought a firm conviction to their minds of his being a vampyre, they\r\ndid not stop to get much of a reinforcement, but plunged on like\r\ngreyhounds in his track.\r\n\r\n"Jack," said the admiral, "this won\'t do. Look at that great lubberly\r\nfellow with the queer smock-frock."\r\n\r\n"Never saw such a figure-head in my life," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Stop him."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\nThe man was coming on at a prodigious rate, and Jack, with all the\r\ndeliberation in the world, advanced to meet him; and when they got\r\nsufficiently close together, that in a few moments they must encounter\r\neach other, Jack made himself into as small a bundle as possible, and\r\npresented his shoulder to the advancing countryman in such a way, that\r\nhe flew off it at a tangent, as if he had run against a brick wall, and\r\nafter rolling head over heels for some distance, safely deposited\r\nhimself in a ditch, where he disappeared completely for a few moments\r\nfrom all human observation.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say I hit you," said Jack. "Curse yer, what did yer run against\r\nme for? Sarves you right. Lubbers as don\'t know how to steer, in course\r\nruns agin things."\r\n\r\n"Bravo," said the admiral; "there\'s another of them."\r\n\r\nThe pursuers of Varney the vampyre, however, now came too thick and fast\r\nto be so easily disposed of, and as soon as his figure could be seen\r\ncoursing over the meadows, and springing over road and ditch with an\r\nagility almost frightful to look upon, the whole rabble rout was in\r\npursuit of him.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the man who had fallen into the ditch had succeeded in\r\nmaking his appearance in the visible world again, and as he crawled up\r\nthe bank, looking a thing of mire and mud, Jack walked up to him with\r\nall the carelessness in the world, and said to him,--\r\n\r\n"Any luck, old chap?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, murder!" said the man, "what do you mean? who are you? where am I?\r\nwhat\'s the matter? Old Muster Fowler, the fat crowner, will set upon me\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Have you caught anything?" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Caught anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ve been in for eels, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"D--n!"\r\n\r\n"Well, it is odd to me, as some people can\'t go a fishing without\r\ngetting out of temper. Have it your own way; I won\'t interfere with\r\nyou;" and away Jack walked.\r\n\r\nThe man cleared the mud out of his eyes, as well as he could, and looked\r\nafter him with a powerful suspicion that in Jack he saw the very cause\r\nof his mortal mishap: but, somehow or other, his immersion in the not\r\nover limpid stream had wonderfully cooled his courage, and casting one\r\ndespairing look upon his begrimed apparel, and another at the last of\r\nthe stragglers who were pursuing Sir Francis Varney across the fields,\r\nhe thought it prudent to get home as fast he could, and get rid of the\r\ndisagreeable results of an adventure which had turned out for him\r\nanything but auspicious or pleasant.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth, as though by a sort of impulse to be present in case\r\nSir Francis Varney should really be run down and with a hope of saving\r\nhim from personal violence, had followed the foremost of the rioters in\r\nthe wood, found it now quite impossible for him to carry on such a chase\r\nas that which was being undertaken across the fields after Sir Francis\r\nVarney.\r\n\r\nHis person was unfortunately but ill qualified for the continuance of\r\nsuch a pursuit, and, although with the greatest reluctance, he at last\r\nfelt himself compelled to give it up.\r\n\r\nIn making his way through the intricacies of the wood, he had been\r\nseriously incommoded by the thick undergrowth, and he had accidentally\r\nencountered several miry pools, with which he had involuntarily made a\r\ncloser acquaintance than was at all conducive either to his personal\r\nappearance or comfort. The doctor\'s temper, though, generally speaking,\r\none of the most even, was at last affected by his mishaps, and he could\r\nnot restrain from an execration upon his want of prudence in letting his\r\nwife have a knowledge of a secret that was not his own, and the\r\nproducing an unlooked for circumstance, the termination of which might\r\nbe of a most disastrous nature.\r\n\r\nTired, therefore, and nearly exhausted by the exertions he had already\r\ntaken, he emerged now alone from the wood, and near the spot where stood\r\nHenry Bannerworth and his friends in consultation.\r\n\r\nThe jaded look of the surgeon was quite sufficient indication of the\r\ntrouble and turmoil he had gone through, and some expressions of\r\nsympathy for his condition were dropped by Henry, to whom he replied,--\r\n\r\n"Nay, my young friend, I deserve it all. I have nothing but my own\r\nindiscretion to thank for all the turmoil and tumult that has arisen\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"But to what possible cause can we attribute such an outrage?"\r\n\r\n"Reproach me as much as you will, I deserve it. A man may prate of his\r\nown secrets if he like, but he should be careful of those of other\r\npeople. I trusted yours to another, and am properly punished."\r\n\r\n"Enough," said Henry; "we\'ll say no more of that, Mr. Chillingworth.\r\nWhat is done cannot be undone, and we had better spend our time in\r\nreflection of how to make the best of what is, than in useless\r\nlamentation over its causes. What is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, I know not. Have you fought the duel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and, as you perceive, harmlessly."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven for that."\r\n\r\n"Nay, I had my fire, which Sir Francis Varney refused to return; so the\r\naffair had just ended, when the sound of approaching tumult came upon\r\nour ears."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"What a strange mixture," exclaimed Marchdale, "of feelings and passions\r\nthis Varney appears to be. At one moment acting with the apparent\r\ngreatest malignity; and another, seeming to have awakened in his mind a\r\nromantic generosity which knows no bounds. I cannot understand him."\r\n\r\n"Nor I, indeed," said Henry; "but yet I somehow tremble for his fate,\r\nand I seem to feel that something ought to be done to save him from the\r\nfearful consequences of popular feeling. Let us hasten to the town, and\r\nprocure what assistance we may: but a few persons, well organised and\r\nproperly armed, will achieve wonders against a desultory and\r\nill-appointed multitude. There may be a chance of saving him, yet, from\r\nthe imminent danger which surrounds him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s proper," cried the admiral. "I don\'t like to see anybody run\r\ndown. A fair fight\'s another thing. Yard arm and yard arm--stink pots\r\nand pipkins--broadside to broadside--and throw in your bodies, if you\r\nlike, on the lee quarter; but don\'t do anything shabby. What do you\r\nthink of it, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I means to say as how if Varney only keeps on sail as he\'s been\r\ndoing, that the devil himself wouldn\'t catch him in a gale."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Henry, "it is our duty to do the best we can. Let us at\r\nonce to the town, and summons all the assistance in our power. Come\r\non--come on!"\r\n\r\nHis friends needed no further urging, but, at a brisk pace, they all\r\nproceeded by the nearest footpaths towards the town.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled his pursuers to think in what possible direction Sir Francis\r\nVarney expected to find sustenance or succour, when they saw how\r\ncuriously he took his flight across the meadows. Instead of\r\nendeavouring, by any circuitous path, to seek the shelter of his own\r\nhouse, or to throw himself upon the care of the authorities of the town,\r\nwho must, to the extent of their power, have protected him, he struck\r\nacross the fields, apparently without aim or purpose, seemingly intent\r\nupon nothing but to distance his pursuers in a long chase, which might\r\npossibly tire them, or it might not, according to their or his powers of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nWe say this seemed to be the case, but it was not so in reality. Sir\r\nFrancis Varney had a deeper purpose, and it was scarcely to be supposed\r\nthat a man of his subtle genius, and, apparently, far-seeing and\r\nreflecting intellect, could have so far overlooked the many dangers of\r\nhis position as not to be fully prepared for some such contingency as\r\nthat which had just now occurred.\r\n\r\nHolding, as he did, so strange a place in society--living among men, and\r\nyet possessing so few attributes in common with humanity--he must all\r\nalong have felt the possibility of drawing upon himself popular\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nHe could not wholly rely upon the secrecy of the Bannerworth family,\r\nmuch as they might well be supposed to shrink from giving publicity to\r\ncircumstances of so fearfully strange and perilous a nature as those\r\nwhich had occurred amongst them. The merest accident might, at any\r\nmoment, make him the town\'s talk. The overhearing of a few chance words\r\nby some gossiping domestic--some ebullition of anger or annoyance by\r\nsome member of the family--or a communication from some friend who had\r\nbeen treated with confidence--might, at any time, awaken around him some\r\nsuch a storm as that which now raged at his heels.\r\n\r\nVarney the vampire must have calculated this. He must have felt the\r\npossibility of such a state of things; and, as a matter of course,\r\npoliticly provided himself with some place of refuge.\r\n\r\nAfter about twenty minutes of hard chasing across the fields, there\r\ncould be no doubt of his intentions. He had such a place of refuge; and,\r\nstrange a one as it might appear, he sped towards it in as direct a line\r\nas ever a well-sped arrow flew towards its mark.\r\n\r\nThat place of refuge, to the surprise of every one, appeared to be the\r\nancient ruin, of which we have before spoken, and which was so well\r\nknown to every inhabitant of the county.\r\n\r\nTruly, it seemed like some act of mere desperation for Sir Francis\r\nVarney to hope there to hide himself. There remained within, of what had\r\nonce been a stately pile, but a few grey crumbling walls, which the\r\nhunted have would have passed unheeded, knowing that not for one instant\r\ncould he have baffled his pursuers by seeking so inefficient a refuge.\r\n\r\nAnd those who followed hard and fast upon the track of Sir Francis\r\nVarney felt so sure of their game, when they saw whither he was\r\nspeeding, that they relaxed in their haste considerably, calling loudly\r\nto each other that the vampire was caught at last, for he could be\r\neasily surrounded among the old ruins, and dragged from amongst its\r\nmoss-grown walls.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, with a wild dash and a cry of exultation, he sprang\r\nout of sight, behind an angle, formed by what had been at one time one\r\nof the principal supports of the ancient structure.\r\n\r\nThen, as if there was still something so dangerous about him, that only\r\nby a great number of hands could he be hoped to be secured, the\r\ninfuriated peasantry gathered in a dense circle around what they\r\nconsidered his temporary place of refuge, and as the sun, which had now\r\nclimbed above the tree tops, and dispersed, in a great measure, many of\r\nthe heavy clouds of morning, shone down upon the excited group, they\r\nmight have been supposed there assembled to perform some superstitious\r\nrite, which time had hallowed as an association of the crumbling ruin\r\naround which they stood.\r\n\r\nBy the time the whole of the stragglers, who had persisted in the chase,\r\nhad come up, there might have been about fifty or sixty resolute men,\r\neach intent upon securing the person of one whom they felt, while in\r\nexistence, would continue to be a terror to all the weaker and dearer\r\nportions of their domestic circles.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of several minutes. Those who had come the fleetest\r\nwere gathering breath, and those who had come up last were looking to\r\ntheir more forward companions for some information as to what had\r\noccurred before their arrival.\r\n\r\nAll was profoundly still within the ruin, and then suddenly, as if by\r\ncommon consent, there arose from every throat a loud shout of\r\n"Down with the vampyre! down with the vampyre!"\r\n\r\nThe echoes of that shout died away, and then all was still as before,\r\nwhile a superstitious feeling crept over even the boldest. It would\r\nalmost seem as if they had expected some kind of response from Sir\r\nFrancis Varney to the shout of defiance with which they had just greeted\r\nhim; but the very calmness, repose, and absolute quiet of the ruin, and\r\nall about it, alarmed them, and they looked the one at the other as if\r\nthe adventure after all were not one of the pleasantest description, and\r\nmight not fall out so happily as they had expected.\r\n\r\nYet what danger could there be? there were they, more than half a\r\nhundred stout, strong men, to cope with one; they felt convinced that he\r\nwas completely in their power; they knew the ruins could not hide him,\r\nand that five minutes time given to the task, would suffice to explore\r\nevery nook and corner of them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they hesitated, while an unknown terror shook their nerves, and\r\nseemingly from the very fact that they had run down their game\r\nsuccessfully, they dreaded to secure the trophy of the chase.\r\n\r\nOne bold spirit was wanting; and, if it was not a bold one that spoke at\r\nlength, he might be complimented as being comparatively such. It was one\r\nwho had not been foremost in the chase, perchance from want of physical\r\npower, who now stood forward, and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for, now? You can have him when you like. If you\r\nwant your wives and children to sleep quietly in their beds, you will\r\nsecure the vampyre. Come on--we all know he\'s here--why do you hesitate?\r\nDo you expect me to go alone and drag him out by the ears?"\r\n\r\nAny voice would have sufficed to break the spell which bound them. This\r\ndid so; and, with one accord, and yells of imprecation, they rushed\r\nforward and plunged among the old walls of the ruin.\r\n\r\nLess time than we have before remarked would have enabled any one to\r\nexplore the tottering fabric sufficient to bring a conviction to their\r\nminds that, after all, there might have been some mistake about the\r\nmatter, and Sir Francis Varney was not quite caught yet.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing how the fact of not finding him in a moment, again\r\nroused all their angry feelings against him, and dispelled every feeling\r\nof superstitious awe with which he had been surrounded; rage gave place\r\nto the sort of shuddering horror with which they had before contemplated\r\nhis immediate destruction, when they had believed him to be virtually\r\nwithin their very grasp.\r\n\r\nOver and over again the ruins were searched--hastily and impatiently by\r\nsome, carefully and deliberately by others, until there could be no\r\ndoubt upon the mind of every one individual, that somehow or somewhere\r\nwithin the shadow of those walls, Sir Francis Varney had disappeared\r\nmost mysteriously.\r\n\r\nThen it would have been a strange sight for any indifferent spectator to\r\nhave seen how they shrunk, one by one, out of the shadow of those ruins;\r\neach seeming to be afraid that the vampyre, in some mysterious manner,\r\nwould catch him if he happened to be the last within their sombre\r\ninfluence; and, when they had all collected in the bright, open space,\r\nsome little distance beyond, they looked at each other and at the ruins,\r\nwith dubious expressions of countenance, each, no doubt, wishing that\r\neach would suggest something of a consolatory or practicable character.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done, now?" said one.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s it," said another, sententiously. "I\'ll be hanged if I\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"He\'s given us the slip," remarked a third.\r\n\r\n"But he can\'t have given us the slip," said one man, who was\r\nparticularly famous for a dogmatical spirit of argumentation; "how is it\r\npossible? he must be here, and I say he is here."\r\n\r\n"Find him, then," cried several at once.\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s nothing to do with the argument; he\'s here, whether we find\r\nhim or not."\r\n\r\nOne very cunning fellow laid his finger on his nose, and beckoned to a\r\ncomrade to retire some paces, where he delivered himself of the\r\nfollowing very oracular sentiment:--\r\n\r\n"My good friend, you must know Sir Francis Varney is here or he isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Agreed, agreed."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he isn\'t here it\'s no use troubling our heads any more about\r\nhim; but, otherwise, it\'s quite another thing, and, upon the whole, I\r\nmust say, that I rather think he is."\r\n\r\nAll looked at him, for it was evident he was big with some suggestion.\r\nAfter a pause, he resumed,--\r\n\r\n"Now, my good friends, I propose that we all appear to give it up, and\r\nto go away; but that some one of us shall remain and hide among the\r\nruins for some time, to watch, in case the vampyre makes his appearance\r\nfrom some hole or corner that we haven\'t found out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, capital!" said everybody.\r\n\r\n"Then you all agree to that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Very good; that\'s the only way to nick him. Now, we\'ll pretend to give\r\nit up; let\'s all of us talk loud about going home."\r\n\r\nThey did all talk loud about going home; they swore that it was not\r\nworth the trouble of catching him, that they gave it up as a bad job;\r\nthat he might go to the deuce in any way he liked, for all they cared;\r\nand then they all walked off in a body, when, the man who had made the\r\nsuggestion, suddenly cried,--\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! hilloa!--stop! stop! you know one of us is to wait?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ay; yes, yes, yes!" said everybody, and still they moved on.\r\n\r\n"But really, you know, what\'s the use of this? who\'s to wait?"\r\n\r\nThat was, indeed, a knotty question, which induced a serious\r\nconsultation, ending in their all, with one accord, pitching upon the\r\nauthor of the suggestion, as by far the best person to hide in the ruins\r\nand catch the vampyre.\r\n\r\nThey then all set off at full speed; but the cunning fellow, who\r\ncertainly had not the slightest idea of so practically carrying out his\r\nown suggestion, scampered off after them with a speed that soon brought\r\nhim in the midst of the throng again, and so, with fear in their looks,\r\nand all the evidences of fatigue about them, they reached the town to\r\nspread fresh and more exaggerated accounts of the mysterious conduct of\r\nVarney the vampyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nVARNEY\'S DANGER, AND HIS RESCUE.--THE PRISONER AGAIN, AND THE\r\nSUBTERRANEAN VAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have before slightly mentioned to the reader, and not unadvisedly,\r\nthe existence of a certain prisoner, confined in a gloomy dungeon, into\r\nwhose sad and blackened recesses but few and faint glimmering rays of\r\nlight ever penetrated; for, by a diabolical ingenuity, the narrow\r\nloophole which served for a window to that subterraneous abode was so\r\nconstructed, that, let the sun be at what point it might, during its\r\ndiurnal course, but a few reflected beams of light could ever find their\r\nway into that abode of sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner--the same prisoner of whom we before spoke--is there.\r\nDespair is in his looks, and his temples are still bound with those\r\ncloths, which seemed now for many days to have been sopped in blood,\r\nwhich has become encrusted in their folds.\r\n\r\nHe still lives, apparently incapable of movement. How he has lived so\r\nlong seems to be a mystery, for one would think him scarcely in a state,\r\neven were nourishment placed to his lips, to enable him to swallow it.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that the mind has as much to do with that apparent\r\nabsolute prostration of all sort of physical energy as those bodily\r\nwounds which he has received at the hands of the enemies who have\r\nreduced him to his present painful and hopeless situation.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a low groan burst from his lips; it seems to come from the\r\nvery bottom of his heart, and it sounds as if it would carry with it\r\nevery remnant of vitality that was yet remaining to him.\r\n\r\nThen he moves restlessly, and repeats in hurried accents the names of\r\nsome who are dear to him, and far away--some who may, perchance, be\r\nmourning him, but who know not, guess not, aught of his present\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nAs he thus moves, the rustle of a chain among the straw on which he lies\r\ngives an indication, that even in that dungeon it has not been\r\nconsidered prudent to leave him master of his own actions, lest, by too\r\nvigorous an effort, he might escape from the thraldom in which he is\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nThe sound reaches his own ears, and for a few moments, in the deep\r\nimpatience of his wounded spirit, he heaps malediction on the heads of\r\nthose who have reduced him to his present state.\r\n\r\nBut soon a better nature seems to come over him, and gentler words fall\r\nfrom his lips. He preaches patience to himself--he talks not of revenge,\r\nbut of justice, and in accents of more hopefulness than he had before\r\nspoken, he calls upon Heaven to succour him in his deep distress.\r\n\r\nThen all is still, and the prisoner appears to have resigned himself\r\nonce more to the calmness of expectation or of despair; but hark! his\r\nsense of hearing, rendered doubly acute by lying so long alone in nearly\r\ndarkness, and in positive silence, detects sounds which, to ordinary\r\nmortal powers of perception, would have been by far too indistinct to\r\nproduce any tangible effect upon the senses.\r\n\r\nIt is the sound of feet--on, on they come; far overhead he hears them;\r\nthey beat the green earth--that sweet, verdant sod, which he may never\r\nsee again--with an impatient tread. Nearer and nearer still; and now\r\nthey pause; he listens with all the intensity of one who listens for\r\nexistence; some one comes; there is a lumbering noise--a hasty footstep;\r\nhe hears some one labouring for breath--panting like a hunted hare; his\r\ndungeon door is opened, and there totters in a man, tall and gaunt; he\r\nreels like one intoxicated; fatigue has done more than the work of\r\ninebriation; he cannot save himself, and he sinks exhausted by the side\r\nof that lonely prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe captive raises himself as far as his chains will allow him; he\r\nclutches the throat of his enervated visitor.\r\n\r\n"Villain, monster, vampyre!" he shrieks, "I have thee now;" and locked\r\nin a deadly embrace, they roll upon the damp earth, struggling for life\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is mid-day at Bannerworth Hall, and Flora is looking from the\r\ncasement anxiously expecting the arrival of her brothers. She had seen,\r\nfrom some of the topmost windows of the Hall, that the whole\r\nneighbourhood had been in a state of commotion, but little did she guess\r\nthe cause of so much tumult, or that it in any way concerned her.\r\n\r\nShe had seen the peasantry forsaking their work in the fields and the\r\ngardens, and apparently intent upon some object of absorbing interest;\r\nbut she feared to leave the house, for she had promised Henry that she\r\nwould not do so, lest the former pacific conduct of the vampyre should\r\nhave been but a new snare, for the purpose of drawing her so far from\r\nher home as to lead her into some danger when she should be far from\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAnd yet more than once was she tempted to forget her promise, and to\r\nseek the open country, for fear that those she loved should be\r\nencountering some danger for her sake, which she would willingly either\r\nshare with them or spare them.\r\n\r\nThe solicitation, however, of her brother kept her comparatively quiet;\r\nand, moreover, since her last interview with Varney, in which, at all\r\nevents, he had shown some feeling for the melancholy situation to which,\r\nhe had reduced her, she had been more able to reason calmly, and to meet\r\nthe suggestions of passion and of impulse with a sober judgment.\r\n\r\nAbout midday, then, she saw the domestic party returning--that party,\r\nwhich now consisted of her two brothers, the admiral, Jack Pringle, and\r\nMr. Chillingworth. As for Mr. Marchdale, he had given them a polite\r\nadieu on the confines of the grounds of Bannerworth Hall, stating, that\r\nalthough he had felt it to be his duty to come forward and second Henry\r\nBannerworth in the duel with the vampyre, yet that circumstance by no\r\nmeans obliterated from his memory the insults he had received from\r\nAdmiral Bell, and, therefore, he declined going to Bannerworth Hall, and\r\nbade them a very good morning.\r\n\r\nTo all this, Admiral Bell replied that he might go and be d----d, if he\r\nliked, and that he considered him a swab and a humbug, and appealed to\r\nJack Pringle whether he, Jack, ever saw such a sanctified looking prig\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," says Jack.\r\n\r\nThis answer, of course, produced the usual contention, which lasted them\r\nuntil they got fairly in the house, where they swore at each other to an\r\nextent that was enough to make any one\'s hair stand on end, until Henry\r\nand Mr. Chillingworth interfered, and really begged that they would\r\npostpone the discussion until some more fitting opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the circumstances were then related to Flora; who, while\r\nshe blamed her brother much for fighting the duel with the vampyre,\r\nfound in the conduct of that mysterious individual, as regarded the\r\nencounter, yet another reason for believing him to be strictly sincere\r\nin his desire to save her from the consequences of his future visits.\r\n\r\nHer desire to leave Bannerworth Hall consequently became more and more\r\nintense, and as the admiral really now considered himself the master of\r\nthe house, they offered no amount of opposition to the subject, but\r\nmerely said,--\r\n\r\n"My dear Flora, Admiral Bell shall decide in all these matters, now. We\r\nknow that he is our sincere friend; and that whatever he says we ought\r\nto do, will be dictated by the best possible feelings towards us."\r\n\r\n"Then I appeal to you, sir," said Flora, turning to the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Very good," replied the old man; "then I say--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, admiral," interrupted Mr. Chillingworth; "you promised me, but a\r\nshort time since, that you would come to no decision whatever upon this\r\nquestion, until you had heard some particulars which I have to relate to\r\nyou, which, in my humble opinion, will sway your judgment."\r\n\r\n"And so I did," cried the admiral; "but I had forgotten all about it.\r\nFlora, my dear, I\'ll be with you in an hour or two. My friend, the\r\ndoctor, here, has got some sow by the ear, and fancies it\'s the right\r\none; however, I\'ll hear what he has got to say, first, before we come to\r\na conclusion. So, come along, Mr. Chillingworth, and let\'s have it out\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"Flora," said Henry, when the admiral had left the room, "I can see that\r\nyou wish to leave the Hall."\r\n\r\n"I do, brother; but not to go far--I wish rather to hide from Varney\r\nthan to make myself inaccessible by distance."\r\n\r\n"You still cling to this neighbourhood?"\r\n\r\n"I do, I do; and you know with what hope I cling to it."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly; you still think it possible that Charles Holland may be\r\nunited to you."\r\n\r\n"I do, I do."\r\n\r\n"You believe his faith."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; as I believe in Heaven\'s mercy."\r\n\r\n"And I, Flora; I would not doubt him now for worlds; something even now\r\nseems to whisper to me that a brighter sun of happiness will yet dawn\r\nupon us, and that, when the mists which at present enshroud ourselves\r\nand our fortunes pass away, they will disclose a landscape full of\r\nbeauty, the future of which shall know no pangs."\r\n\r\n"Yes, brother," exclaimed Flora, enthusiastically; "this, after all, may\r\nbe but some trial, grievous while it lasts, but yet tending eventually\r\nonly to make the future look more bright and beautiful. Heaven may yet\r\nhave in store for us all some great happiness, which shall spring\r\nclearly and decidedly from out these misfortunes."\r\n\r\n"Be it so, and may we ever thus banish despair by such hopeful\r\npropositions. Lean on my arm, Flora; you are safe with me. Come,\r\ndearest, and taste the sweetness of the morning air."\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed now, a hopefulness about the manner in which Henry\r\nBannerworth spoke, such as Flora had not for some weary months had the\r\npleasure of listening to, and she eagerly rose to accompany him into the\r\ngarden, which was glowing with all the beauty of sunshine, for the day\r\nhad turned out to be much finer than the early morning had at all\r\npromised it would be.\r\n\r\n"Flora," he said, when they had taken some turns to and fro in the\r\ngarden, "notwithstanding all that has happened, there is no convincing\r\nMr. Chillingworth that Sir Francis Varney is really what to us he\r\nappears."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"It is so. In the face of all evidence, he neither will believe in\r\nvampyres at all, nor that Varney is anything but some mortal man, like\r\nourselves, in his thoughts, talents, feelings, and modes of life; and\r\nwith no more power to do any one an injury than we have."\r\n\r\n"Oh, would that I could think so!"\r\n\r\n"And I; but, unhappily, we have by far too many, and too conclusive\r\nevidences to the contrary."\r\n\r\n"We have, indeed, brother."\r\n\r\n"And though, while we respect that strength of mind in our friend which\r\nwill not allow him, even almost at the last extremity, to yield to what\r\nappear to be stern facts, we may not ourselves be so obdurate, but may\r\nfeel that we know enough to be convinced."\r\n\r\n"You have no doubt, brother?"\r\n\r\n"Most reluctantly, I must confess, that I feel compelled to consider\r\nVarney as something more than mortal."\r\n\r\n"He must be so."\r\n\r\n"And now, sister, before we leave the place which has been a home to us\r\nfrom earliest life, let us for a few moments consider if there be any\r\npossible excuse for the notion of Mr. Chillingworth, to the effect that\r\nSir Francis Varney wants possession of the house for some purpose still\r\nmore inimical to our peace and prosperity than any he has yet\r\nattempted."\r\n\r\n"Has he such an opinion?"\r\n\r\n"He has."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis very strange."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Flora; he seems to gather from all the circumstances, nothing but\r\nan overwhelming desire on the part of Sir Francis Varney to become the\r\ntenant of Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"He certainly wishes to possess it."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but can you, sister, in the exercise of any possible amount of\r\nfancy, imagine any motive for such an anxiety beyond what he alleges?"\r\n\r\n"Which is merely that he is fond of old houses."\r\n\r\n"Precisely so. That is the reason, and the only one, that can be got\r\nfrom him. Heaven only knows if it be the true one."\r\n\r\n"It may be, brother."\r\n\r\n"As you say, it may; but there\'s a doubt, nevertheless, Flora. I much\r\nrejoice that you have had an interview with this mysterious being, for\r\nyou have certainty, since that time, been happier and more composed than\r\nI ever hoped to see you again."\r\n\r\n"I have indeed."\r\n\r\n"It is sufficiently perceivable."\r\n\r\n"Somehow, brother, since that interview, I have not had the same sort of\r\ndread of Sir Francis Varney which before made the very sound of his name\r\na note of terror to me. His words, and all he said to me during that\r\ninterview which took place so strangely between us, indeed how I know\r\nnot, tended altogether rather to make him, to a certain extent, an\r\nobject of my sympathies rather than my abhorrence."\r\n\r\n"That is very strange."\r\n\r\n"I own that it is strange, Henry; but when we come for but a brief\r\nmoment to reflect upon the circumstances which have occurred, we shall,\r\nI think, be able to find some cause even to pity Varney the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Thus, brother. It is said--and well may I who have been subject to an\r\nattack of such a nature, tremble to repeat the saying--that those who\r\nhave been once subject to the visitations of a vampyre, are themselves\r\nin a way to become one of the dreadful and maddening fraternity."\r\n\r\n"I have heard so much, sister," replied Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and therefore who knows but that Sir Francis Varney may, at one\r\ntime, have been as innocent as we are ourselves of the terrible and\r\nfiendish propensity which now makes him a terror and a reproach to all\r\nwho know him, or are in any way obnoxious to his attacks."\r\n\r\n"That is true."\r\n\r\n"There may have been a time--who shall say there was not?--when he, like\r\nme, would have shrunk, with a dread as great as any one could have\r\nexperienced, from the contamination of the touch even of a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I cannot, sister, deny the soundness of your reasoning," said Henry,\r\nwith a sigh; "but I still no not see anything, even from a full\r\nconviction that Varney is unfortunate, which should induce us to\r\ntolerate him."\r\n\r\n"Nay, brother, I said not tolerate. What I mean is, that even with the\r\nhorror and dread we must naturally feel at such a being, we may afford\r\nto mingle some amount of pity, which shall make us rather seek to shun\r\nhim, than to cross his path with a resolution of doing him an injury."\r\n\r\n"I perceive well, sister, what you mean. Rather than remain here, and\r\nmake an attempt to defy Sir Francis Varney, you would fly from him, and\r\nleave him undisputed master of the field."\r\n\r\n"I would--I would."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid that I or any one should thwart you. You know well,\r\nFlora, how dear you are to me; you know well that your happiness has\r\never been to us all a matter which has assumed the most important of\r\nshapes, as regarded our general domestic policy. It is not, therefore,\r\nlikely now, dear sister, that we should thwart you in your wish to\r\nremove from here."\r\n\r\n"I know, Henry, all you would say," remarked Flora, as a tear started to\r\nher eyes. "I know well all you think, and, in your love for me, I\r\nlikewise know well I rely for ever. You are attached to this place, as,\r\nindeed, we all are, by a thousand happy and pleasant associations; but\r\nlisten to me further, Henry, I do not wish to wander far."\r\n\r\n"Not far, Flora?"\r\n\r\n"No. Do I not still cling to a hope that Charles may yet appear? and if\r\nhe do so, it will assuredly be in this neighbourhood, which he knows is\r\nnative and most dear to us all."\r\n\r\n"True."\r\n\r\n"Then do I wish to make some sort of parade, in the way of publicity, of\r\nour leaving the Hall."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"And yet not go far. In the neighbouring town, for example, surely we\r\nmight find some means of living entirely free from remark or observation\r\nas to who or what we were."\r\n\r\n"That, sister, I doubt. If you seek for that species of solitude which\r\nyou contemplate, it is only to be found in a desert."\r\n\r\n"A desert?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; or in a large city."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Flora; you may well believe me, that it is so. In a small community\r\nyou can have no possible chance of evading an amount of scrutiny which\r\nwould very soon pierce through any disguise you could by any possibility\r\nassume."\r\n\r\n"Then there is no resource. We must go far."\r\n\r\n"Nay, I will consider for you, Flora; and although, as a general\r\nprinciple, what I have said I know to be true, yet some more special\r\ncircumstance may arise that may point a course that, while it enables\r\nus, for Charles Holland\'s sake, to remain in this immediate\r\nneighbourhood, yet will procure to us all the secrecy we may desire."\r\n\r\n"Dear--dear brother," said Flora, as she flung herself upon Henry\'s\r\nneck, "you speak cheeringly to me, and, what is more, you believe in\r\nCharles\'s faithfulness and truth."\r\n\r\n"As Heaven is my judge, I do."\r\n\r\n"A thousand, thousand thanks for such an assurance. I know him too well\r\nto doubt, for one moment, his faith. Oh, brother! could he--could\r\nCharles Holland, the soul of honour, the abode of every noble impulse\r\nthat can adorn humanity--could he have written those letters? No, no!\r\nperish the thought!"\r\n\r\n"It has perished."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!"\r\n\r\n"I only, upon reflection, wonder how, misled for the moment by the\r\nconcurrence of a number of circumstances, I could ever have suspected\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"It is like your generous nature, brother to say so; but you know as\r\nwell as I, that there has been one here who has, far from feeling any\r\nsort of anxiety to think as well as possible of poor Charles Holland,\r\nhas done all that in him lay to take the worst view of his mysterious\r\ndisappearance, and induce us to do the like."\r\n\r\n"You allude to Mr. Marchdale?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Well, Flora, at the same time that I must admit you have cause for\r\nspeaking of Mr. Marchdale as you do, yet when we come to consider all\r\nthings, there may be found for him excuses."\r\n\r\n"May there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Flora; he is a man, as he himself says, past the meridian of life,\r\nand the world is a sad as well as a bad teacher, for it soon--too soon,\r\nalas! deprives us of our trusting confidence in human nature."\r\n\r\n"It may be so; but yet, he, knowing as he did so very little of Charles\r\nHolland, judged him hastily and harshly."\r\n\r\n"You rather ought to say, Flora, that he did not judge him generously."\r\n\r\n"Well, be it so."\r\n\r\n"And you must recollect, when you say so, that Marchdale did not love\r\nCharles Holland."\r\n\r\n"Nay, now," said Flora, while there flashed across her cheek, for a\r\nmoment, a heightened colour, "you are commencing to jest with me, and,\r\ntherefore, we will say no more. You know, dear Henry, all my hopes, my\r\nwishes, and my feelings, and I shall therefore leave my future destiny\r\nin your hands, to dispose of as you please. Look yonder!"\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"There. Do you not see the admiral and Mr. Chillingworth walking among\r\nthe trees?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I do now."\r\n\r\n"How very serious and intent they are upon the subject of their\r\ndiscourse. They seem quite lost to all surrounding objects. I could not\r\nhave imagined any subject that would so completely have absorbed the\r\nattention of Admiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chillingworth had something to relate to him or to propose, of a\r\nnature which, perchance, has had the effect of enchaining all his\r\nattention--he called him from the room."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I saw that he did. But see, they come towards us, and now we\r\nshall, probably, hear what is the subject-matter of their discourse and\r\nconsultation."\r\n\r\n"We shall."\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell had evidently seen Henry and his sister, for now, suddenly,\r\nas if not from having for the first moment observed them, and, in\r\nconsequence, broken off their private discourse, but as if they arrived\r\nat some point in it which enabled them to come to a conclusion to be\r\ncommunicative, the admiral came towards the brother and sister.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the bluff old admiral, when they were sufficiently near to\r\nexchange words, "well, Miss Flora, you are looking a thousand times\r\nbetter than you were."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, admiral, I am much better."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to be sure you are; and you will be much better still, and no sort\r\nof mistake. Now, here\'s the doctor and I have both been agreeing upon\r\nwhat is best for you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure. Have we not, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"We have, admiral."\r\n\r\n"Good; and what, now, Miss Flora, do you suppose it is?"\r\n\r\n"I really cannot say."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s change of air, to be sure. You must get away from here as\r\nquickly as you can, or there will be no peace for you."\r\n\r\n"Yes," added Mr. Chillingworth, advancing; "I am quite convinced that\r\nchange of scene and change of place, and habits, and people, will tend\r\nmore to your complete recovery than any other circumstances. In the most\r\nordinary cases of indisposition we always find that the invalid recovers\r\nmuch sooner away from the scene of his indisposition, than by remaining\r\nin it, even though its general salubrity be much greater than the place\r\nto which he may be removed."\r\n\r\n"Good," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Then we are to understand," said Henry, with a smile, "that we are no\r\nlonger to be your guests, Admiral Bell?"\r\n\r\n"Belay there!" cried the admiral; "who told you to understand any such\r\nthing, I should like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but we shall look upon this house as yours, now; and, that being\r\nthe case, if we remove from it, of course we cease to be your guests any\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know about it. Now, hark ye. You don\'t command the\r\nfleet, so don\'t pretend to know what the admiral is going to do. I have\r\nmade money by knocking about some of the enemies of old England, and\r\nthat\'s the most gratifying manner in the world of making money, so far\r\nas I am concerned."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"It is an honourable mode."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. Well, I am going to--what the deuce do you call it?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I want to know. Oh, I have it now. I am going to what\r\nthe lawyers call invest it."\r\n\r\n"A prudent step, admiral, and one which it is to be hoped, before now,\r\nhas occurred to you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it has and perhaps it hasn\'t; however, that\'s my business, and\r\nno one\'s else\'s. I am going to invest my spare cash in taking houses;\r\nso, as I don\'t care a straw where the houses may be situated, you can\r\nlook out for one somewhere that will suit you, and I\'ll take it; so,\r\nafter all, you will be my guests there just the same as you are here."\r\n\r\n"Admiral," said Henry, "it would be imposing upon a generosity as rare\r\nas it is noble, were we to allow you to do so much for us as you\r\ncontemplate."\r\n\r\n"Very good."\r\n\r\n"We cannot--we dare not."\r\n\r\n"But I say you shall. So you have had your say, and I\'ve had mine, after\r\nwhich, if you please, Master Henry Bannerworth, I shall take upon myself\r\nto consider the affair as altogether settled. You can commence\r\noperations as soon as you like. I know that Miss Flora, here--bless her\r\nsweet eyes--don\'t want to stay at Bannerworth Hall any longer than she\r\ncan help it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I was urging upon Henry to remove," said Flora; "but yet I\r\ncannot help feeling with him, admiral, that we are imposing upon your\r\ngoodness."\r\n\r\n"Go on imposing, then."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Psha! Can\'t a man be imposed upon if he likes? D--n it, that\'s a poor\r\nprivilege for an Englishman to be forced to make a row about. I tell you\r\nI like it. I will be imposed upon, so there\'s an end of that; and now\r\nlet\'s come in and see what Mrs. Bannerworth has got ready for luncheon."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that such a popular ferment as had been\r\ncreated in the country town, by the singular reports concerning Varney\r\nthe Vampyre, should readily, and without abundant satisfaction, subside.\r\n\r\nAn idea like that which had lent so powerful an impulse to the popular\r\nmind, was one far easier to set going than to deprecate or extinguish.\r\nThe very circumstances which had occurred to foil the excited mob in\r\ntheir pursuit of Sir Francis Varney, were of a nature to increase the\r\npopular superstition concerning him, and to make him and his acts appear\r\nin still more dreadful colours.\r\n\r\nMobs do not reason very closely and clearly; but the very fact of the\r\nfrantic flight of Sir Francis Varney from the projected attack of the\r\ninfuriated multitude, was seized hold of as proof positive of the\r\nreality of his vampyre-like existence.\r\n\r\nThen, again, had he not disappeared in the most mysterious manner? Had\r\nhe not sought refuge where no human being would think of seeking refuge,\r\nnamely, in that old, dilapidated ruin, where, when his pursuers were so\r\nclose upon his track, he had succeeded in eluding their grasp with a\r\nfacility which looked as if he had vanished into thin air, or as if the\r\nvery earth had opened to receive him bodily within its cold embraces?\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, that the few who fled so precipitately from\r\nthe ruin, lost nothing of the wonderful story they had to tell, in the\r\ncarrying it from that place to the town. When they reached their\r\nneighbours, they not only told what had really occurred, but they added\r\nto it all their own surmises, and the fanciful creation of all their own\r\nfears, so that before mid-day, and about the time when Henry Bannerworth\r\nwas conversing so quietly in the gardens of the Hall with his beautiful\r\nsister, there was an amount of popular ferment in the town, of which\r\nthey had no conception.\r\n\r\nAll business was suspended, and many persons, now that once the idea had\r\nbeen started concerning the possibility that a vampyre might have been\r\nvisiting some of the houses in the place, told how, in the dead of the\r\nnight, they had heard strange noises. How children had shrieked from no\r\napparent cause--doors opened and shut without human agency; and windows\r\nrattled that never had been known to rattle before.\r\n\r\nSome, too, went so far as to declare that they had been awakened out of\r\ntheir sleep by noises incidental to an effort made to enter their\r\nchambers; and others had seen dusky forms of gigantic proportions\r\noutside their windows, tampering with their fastenings, and only\r\ndisappearing when the light of day mocked all attempts at concealment.\r\n\r\nThese tales flew from mouth to mouth, and all listened to them with such\r\nan eager interest, that none thought it worth while to challenge their\r\ninconsistencies, or to express a doubt of their truth, because they had\r\nnot been mentioned before.\r\n\r\nThe only individual, and he was a remarkably clever man, who made the\r\nslightest remark upon the subject of a practical character, hazarded a\r\nsuggestion that made confusion worse confounded.\r\n\r\nHe knew something of vampyres. He had travelled abroad, and had heard of\r\nthem in Germany, as well as in the east, and, to a crowd of wondering\r\nand aghast listeners, he said,--\r\n\r\n"You may depend upon it, my friends, this has been going on for some\r\ntime; there have been several mysterious and sudden deaths in the town\r\nlately; people have wasted away and died nobody knew how or wherefore."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes," said everybody.\r\n\r\n"There was Miles, the butcher; you know how fat he was, and then how fat\r\nhe wasn\'t."\r\n\r\nA general assent was given to the proposition; and then, elevating one\r\narm in an oratorical manner, the clever fellow continued,--\r\n\r\n"I have not a doubt that Miles, the butcher, and every one else who has\r\ndied suddenly lately, have been victims of the vampyre; and what\'s more,\r\nthey\'ll all be vampyres, and come and suck other people\'s blood, till at\r\nlast the whole town will be a town of vampyres."\r\n\r\n"But what\'s to be done?" cried one, who trembled so excessively that he\r\ncould scarcely stand under his apprehension.\r\n\r\n"There is but one plan--Sir Francis Varney must be found, and put out of\r\nthe world in such a manner that he can\'t come back to it again; and all\r\nthose who are dead that we have any suspicion of, should be taken up out\r\nof their graves and looked at, to see if they\'re rotting or not; if they\r\nare it\'s all right; but, if they look fresh and much, as usual, you may\r\ndepend they\'re vampyres, and no mistake."\r\n\r\nThis was a terrific suggestion thrown amongst a mob. To have caught Sir\r\nFrancis Varney and immolated him at the shrine of popular fury, they\r\nwould not have shrunk from; but a desecration of the graves of those\r\nwhom they had known in life was a matter which, however much it had to\r\nrecommend it, even the boldest stood aghast at, and felt some qualms of\r\nirresolution.\r\n\r\nThere are many ideas, however, which, like the first plunge into a cold\r\nbath, are rather uncomfortable for the moment; but which, in a little\r\ntime, we become so familiarized with, that they become stripped of their\r\ndisagreeable concomitants, and appear quite pleasing and natural.\r\n\r\nSo it was with this notion of exhuming the dead bodies of those\r\ntownspeople who had recently died from what was called a decay of\r\nnature, and such other failures of vitality as bore not the tangible\r\nname of any understood disease.\r\n\r\nFrom mouth to mouth the awful suggestion spread like wildfire, until at\r\nlast it grew into such a shape that it almost seemed to become a duty,\r\nat all events, to have up Miles the butcher, and see how he looked.\r\n\r\nThere is, too, about human nature a natural craving curiosity concerning\r\neverything connected with the dead. There is not a man of education or\r\nof intellectual endowment who would not travel many miles to look upon\r\nthe exhumation of the remains of some one famous in his time, whether\r\nfor his vices, his virtues, his knowledge, his talents, or his heroism;\r\nand, if this feeling exist in the minds of the educated and refined in a\r\nsublimated shape, which lends to it grace and dignity, we may look for\r\nit among the vulgar and the ignorant, taking only a grosser and meaner\r\nform, in accordance with their habits of thought. The rude materials, of\r\nwhich the highest and noblest feelings of educated minds are formed,\r\nwill be found amongst the most grovelling and base; and so this vulgar\r\ncuriosity, which, combined with other feelings, prompted an ignorant and\r\nilliterate mob to exhume Miles, the once fat butcher, in a different\r\nform tempted the philosophic Hamlet to moralise upon the skull of\r\nYorick.\r\n\r\nAnd it was wonderful to see how, when these people had made up their\r\nminds to carry out the singularly interesting, but, at the same,\r\nfearful, suggestion, they assumed to themselves a great virtue in so\r\ndoing--told each other what an absolute necessity there was, for the\r\npublic good, that it should be done; and then, with loud shouts and\r\ncries concerning the vampyre, they proceeded in a body to the village\r\nchurchyard, where had been lain, with a hope of reposing in peace, the\r\nbones of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nA species of savage ferocity now appeared to have seized upon the crowd,\r\nand the people, in making up their minds to do something which was\r\nstrikingly at variance with all their preconceived notions of right and\r\nwrong, appeared to feel that it was necessary, in order that they might\r\nbe consistent, to cast off many of the decencies of life, and to become\r\nriotous and reckless.\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded towards the graveyard, they amused themselves by\r\nbreaking the windows of the tax-gatherers, and doing what passing\r\nmischief they could to the habitations of all who held any official\r\nsituation or authority.\r\n\r\nThis was something like a proclamation of war against those who might\r\nthink it their duty to interfere with the lawless proceedings of an\r\nignorant multitude. A public-house or two, likewise, _en route_, was\r\nsacked of some of its inebriating contents, so that, what with the\r\nmadness of intoxication, and the general excitement consequent upon the\r\nvery nature of the business which took them to the churchyard, a more\r\nwild and infuriated multitude than that which paused at two iron gates\r\nwhich led into the sanctuary of that church could not be imagined.\r\n\r\nThose who have never seen a mob placed in such a situation as to have\r\ncast off all moral restraint whatever, at the same time that it feels\r\nthere is no physical power to cope with it, can form no notion of the\r\nmass of terrible passions which lie slumbering under what, in ordinary\r\ncases, have appeared harmless bosoms, but which now run riot, and\r\novercame every principle of restraint. It is a melancholy fact, but,\r\nnevertheless, a fact, despite its melancholy, that, even in a civilised\r\ncountry like this, with a generally well-educated population, nothing\r\nbut a well-organised physical force keeps down, from the commission of\r\nthe most outrageous offences, hundreds and thousands of persons.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the mob paused at the iron gates of the churchyard,\r\nbut it was more a pause of surprise than one of vacillation, because\r\nthey saw that those iron gates were closed, which had not been the case\r\nwithin the memory of the oldest among them.\r\n\r\nAt the first building of the church, and the enclosure of its graveyard,\r\ntwo pairs of these massive gates had been presented by some munificent\r\npatron; but, after a time, they hung idly upon their hinges, ornamental\r\ncertainly, but useless, while a couple of turnstiles, to keep cattle\r\nfrom straying within the sacred precincts, did duty instead, and\r\nestablished, without trouble, the regular thoroughfare, which long habit\r\nhad dictated as necessary, through the place of sepulture.\r\n\r\nBut now those gates were closed, and for once were doing duty. Heaven\r\nonly knows how they had been moved upon their rusty and time-worn\r\nhinges. The mob, however, was checked for the moment, and it was clear\r\nthat the ecclesiastical authorities were resolved to attempt something\r\nto prevent the desecration of the tombs.\r\n\r\nThose gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake\r\nwhich was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd, and\r\nthen one fellow started the idea that they might be opened from the\r\ninside, and volunteered to clamber over the wall to do so.\r\n\r\nHoisted up upon the shoulders of several, he grasped the top of the\r\nwall, and raised his head above its level, and then something of a\r\nmysterious nature rose up from the inside, and dealt him such a whack\r\nbetween the eyes, that down he went sprawling among his coadjutors.\r\n\r\nNow, nobody had seen how this injury had been inflicted, and the policy\r\nof those in the garrison should have been certainly to keep up the\r\nmystery, and leave the invaders in ignorance of what sort of person it\r\nwas that had so foiled them. Man, however, is prone to indulge in vain\r\nglorification, and the secret was exploded by the triumphant waving of\r\nthe long staff of the beadle, with the gilt knob at the end of it, just\r\nover the parapet of the wall, in token of victory.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Waggles! it\'s Waggles!" cried everybody "it\'s Waggles, the\r\nbeadle!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said a voice from within, "it\'s Waggles, the beadle; and he\r\nthinks as he had yer there rather; try it again. The church isn\'t in\r\ndanger; oh, no. What do you think of this?"\r\n\r\nThe staff was flourished more vigorously than ever, and in the secure\r\nposition that Waggles occupied it seemed not only impossible to attack\r\nhim, but that he possessed wonderful powers of resistance, for the staff\r\nwas long and the knob was heavy.\r\n\r\nIt was a boy who hit upon the ingenious expedient of throwing up a great\r\nstone, so that it just fell inside the wall, and hit Waggles a great\r\nblow on the head.\r\n\r\nThe staff was flourished more vigorously than ever, and the mob, in the\r\necstasy at the fun which was going on, almost forgot the errand which\r\nhad brought them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after all the affair might have passed off jestingly, had not\r\nthere been some really mischievous persons among the throng who were\r\ndetermined that such should not be the case, and they incited the\r\nmultitude to commence an attack upon the gates, which in a few moments\r\nmust have produced their entire demolition.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, the boldest drew back, and there was a pause, as the\r\nwell-known form of the clergyman appeared advancing from the church\r\ndoor, attired in full canonicals.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Mr. Leigh," said several; "how unlucky he should be here."\r\n\r\n"What is this?" said the clergyman, approaching the gates. "Can I\r\nbelieve my eyes when I see before me those who compose the worshippers\r\nat this church armed, and attempting to enter for the purpose of\r\nviolence to this sacred place! Oh! let me beseech you, lose not a\r\nmoment, but return to your homes, and repent of that which you have\r\nalready done. It is not yet too late; listen, I pray you, to the voice\r\nof one with whom you have so often joined in prayer to the throne of the\r\nAlmighty, who is now looking upon your actions."\r\n\r\nThis appeal was heard respectfully, but it was evidently very far from\r\nsuiting the feelings and the wishes of those to whom it was addressed;\r\nthe presence of the clergyman was evidently an unexpected circumstance,\r\nand the more especially too as he appeared in that costume which they\r\nhad been accustomed to regard with a reverence almost amounting to\r\nveneration. He saw the favourable effect he had produced, and anxious to\r\nfollow it up, he added,--\r\n\r\n"Let this little ebullition of feeling pass away, my friends; and,\r\nbelieve me, when I assure you upon my sacred word, that whatever ground\r\nthere may be for complaint or subject for inquiry, shall be fully and\r\nfairly met; and that the greatest exertions shall be made to restore\r\npeace and tranquillity to all of you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all about the vampyre!" cried one fellow--"Mr. Leigh, how should\r\nyou like a vampyre in the pulpit?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush! can it be possible that you know so little of the works of\r\nthat great Being whom you all pretend to adore, as to believe that he\r\nwould create any class of beings of a nature such as those you ascribe\r\nto that terrific word! Oh, let me pray of you to get rid of these\r\nsuperstitions--alike disgraceful to yourselves and afflicting to me."\r\n\r\nThe clergyman had the satisfaction of seeing the crowd rapidly thinning\r\nfrom before the gates, and he believed his exhortations were having all\r\nthe effect he wished. It was not until he heard a loud shout behind him,\r\nand, upon hastily turning, saw that the churchyard had been scaled at\r\nanother place by some fifty or sixty persons, that his heart sunk within\r\nhim, and he began to feel that what he had dreaded would surely come to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nEven then he might have done something in the way of pacific exertion,\r\nbut for the interference of Waggles, the beadle, who spoilt everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN GRAVES.--THE DEAD BODIES.--A SCENE OF TERROR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have said Waggles spoilt everything, and so he did, for before Mr.\r\nLeigh could utter a word more, or advance two steps towards the rioters,\r\nWaggles charged them staff in hand, and there soon ensued a riot of a\r\nmost formidable description.\r\n\r\nA kind of desperation seemed to have seized the beadle, and certainly,\r\nby his sudden and unexpected attack, he achieved wonders. When, however,\r\na dozen hands got hold of the staff, and it was wrenched from him, and\r\nhe was knocked down, and half-a-dozen people rolled over him, Waggles\r\nwas not near the man he had been, and he would have been very well\r\ncontent to have lain quiet where he was; this, however, he was not\r\npermitted to do, for two or three, who had felt what a weighty\r\ninstrument of warfare the parochial staff was, lifted him bodily from\r\nthe ground, and canted him over the wall, without much regard to whether\r\nhe fell on a hard or a soft place on the other side.\r\n\r\nThis feat accomplished, no further attention was paid to Mr. Leigh, who,\r\nfinding that his exhortations were quite unheeded, retired into the\r\nchurch with an appearance of deep affliction about him, and locked\r\nhimself in the vestry.\r\n\r\nThe crowd now had entire possession--without even the sort of control\r\nthat an exhortation assumed over them--of the burying-ground, and soon\r\nin a dense mass were these desperate and excited people collected round\r\nthe well-known spot where lay the mortal remains of Miles, the butcher.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" cried a loud voice, and every one obeyed the mandate, looking\r\ntowards the speaker, who was a tall, gaunt-looking man, attired in a\r\nsuit of faded black, and who now pressed forward to the front of the\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried one, "it\'s Fletcher, the ranter. What does he do here?"\r\n\r\n"Hear him! hear him!" cried others; "he won\'t stop us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, hear him," cried the tall man, waving his arms about like the\r\nsails of a windmill. "Yes, hear him. Sons of darkness, you\'re all\r\nvampyres, and are continually sucking the life-blood from each other. No\r\nwonder that the evil one has power over you all. You\'re as men who walk\r\nin the darkness when the sunlight invites you, and you listen to the\r\nwords of humanity when those of a diviner origin are offered to your\r\nacceptance. But there shall be miracles in the land, and even in this\r\nplace, set apart with a pretended piety that is in itself most damnable,\r\nyou shall find an evidence of the true light; and the proof that those\r\nwho will follow me the true path to glory shall be found here within\r\nthis grave. Dig up Miles, the butcher!"\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear, hear, hurra!" said every body. "Mr. Fletcher\'s not such a\r\nfool, after all. He means well."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you sinners," said the ranter, "and if you find Miles, the\r\nbutcher, decaying--even as men are expected to decay whose mortal\r\ntabernacles are placed within the bowels of the earth--you shall gather\r\nfrom that a great omen, and a sign that if you follow me you seek the\r\nLord; but I you find him looking fresh and healthy, as if the warm blood\r\nwas still within his veins, you shall take that likewise as a\r\nsignification that what I say to you shall be as the Gospel, and that by\r\ncoming to the chapel of the Little Boozlehum, ye shall achieve a great\r\nsalvation."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said a brawny fellow, advancing with a spade in his hand;\r\n"you get out of the way, and I\'ll soon have him up. Here goes, like blue\r\nblazes!"\r\n\r\nThe first shovelful of earth he took up, he cast over his head into the\r\nair, so that it fell in a shower among the mob, which of course raised a\r\nshout of indignation; and, as he continued so to dispose of the\r\nsuperfluous earth, a general row seemed likely to ensue. Mr. Fletcher\r\nopened his mouth to make a remark, and, as that feature of his face was\r\nrather a capacious one, a descending lump of mould, of a clayey\r\nconsistency, fell into it, and got so wedged among his teeth, that in\r\nthe process of extracting it he nearly brought some of those essential\r\nportions of his anatomy with it.\r\n\r\nThis was a state of things that could not last long, and he who had been\r\nso liberal with his spadesful of mould was speedily disarmed, and yet he\r\nwas a popular favourite, and had done the thing so good-humouredly, that\r\nnobody touched him. Six or eight others, who had brought spades and\r\npickaxes, now pushed forward to the work, and in an incredibly short\r\nspace of time the grave of Miles, the butcher, seemed to be very nearly\r\nexcavated.\r\n\r\nWork of any kind or nature whatever, is speedily executed when done with\r\na wish to get through it; and never, perhaps, within the memory of man,\r\nwas a grave opened in that churchyard with such a wonderful celerity.\r\nThe excitement of the crowd grew intense--every available spot from\r\nwhich a view of the grave could be got, was occupied; for the last few\r\nminutes scarcely a remark had been uttered, and when, at last, the spade\r\nof one of those who were digging struck upon something that sounded like\r\nwood, you might have heard a pin drop, and each one there present drew\r\nhis breath more shortly than before.\r\n\r\n"There he is," said the man, whose spade struck upon the coffin.\r\n\r\nThose few words broke the spell, and there was a general murmur, while\r\nevery individual present seemed to shift his position in his anxiety to\r\nobtain a better view of what was about to ensue.\r\n\r\nThe coffin now having been once found, there seemed to be an increased\r\nimpetus given to the work; the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that\r\nseemed almost the quick result of the working of some machine; and those\r\nclosest to the grave\'s brink crouched down, and, intent as they were\r\nupon the progress of events, heeded not the damp earth that fell upon\r\nthem, nor the frail brittle and humid remains of humanity that\r\noccasionally rolled to their feet.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a scene of intense excitement--a scene which only wanted\r\na few prominent features in its foreground of a more intellectual and\r\nhigher cast than composed the mob, to make it a fit theme for a painter\r\nof the highest talent.\r\n\r\nAnd now the last few shovelfuls of earth that hid the top of the coffin\r\nwere cast from the grave, and that narrow house which contained the\r\nmortal remains of him who was so well known, while in life, to almost\r\nevery one then present, was brought to the gaze of eyes which never had\r\nseemed likely to have looked upon him again.\r\n\r\nThe cry was now for ropes, with which to raise the cumbrous mass; but\r\nthese were not to be had, no one thought of providing himself with such\r\nappliances, so that by main strength, only, could the coffin be raised\r\nto the brink.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of doing this was immense, for there was nothing tangible\r\nto stand upon; and even when the mould from the sides was sufficiently\r\ncleared away, that the handles of the coffin could be laid hold of, they\r\ncame away immediately in the grasp of those who did so.\r\n\r\nBut the more trouble that presented itself to the accomplishment of the\r\ndesigns of the mob, the more intent that body seemed upon carrying out\r\nto the full extent their original designs.\r\n\r\nFinding it quite impossible by bodily strength to raise the coffin of\r\nthe butcher from the position in which it had got imbedded by excessive\r\nrains, a boy was hastily despatched to the village for ropes, and never\r\ndid boy run with such speed before, for all his own curiosity was\r\nexcited in the issue of an adventure, that to his young imagination was\r\nappallingly interesting.\r\n\r\nAs impatient as mobs usually are, they had not time, in this case, for\r\nthe exercise of that quality of mind before the boy came back with the\r\nnecessary means of exerting quite a different species of power against\r\nthe butcher\'s coffin.\r\n\r\nStrong ropes were slid under the inert mass, and twenty hands at once\r\nplied the task of raising that receptacle of the dead from what had been\r\npresumed to be its last resting-place. The ropes strained and creaked,\r\nand many thought that they would burst asunder sooner than raise the\r\nheavy coffin of the defunct butcher.\r\n\r\nIt is singular what reasons people find for backing their opinion.\r\n\r\n"You may depend he\'s a vampyre," said one, "or it wouldn\'t be so\r\ndifficult to get him out of the grave."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there can be no mistake about that," said one; "when did a natural\r\nChristian\'s coffin stick in the mud in that way?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure," said another; "I knew no good would come of his goings\r\non; he never was a decent sort of man like his neighbours, and many\r\nqueer things have been said of him that I have no doubt are true enough,\r\nif we did but know the rights of them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but," said a young lad, thrusting his head between the two who were\r\ntalking, "if he is a vampyre, how does he get out of his coffin of a\r\nnight with all that weight of mould a top of him?"\r\n\r\nOne of the men considered for a moment, and then finding no rational\r\nanswer occur to him, he gave the boy a box on the ear, saying,--\r\n\r\n"I should like to know what business that is of yours? Boys, now-a-days,\r\nain\'t like the boys in my time; they think nothing now of putting their\r\nspokes in grown-up people\'s wheels, just as if their opinions were of\r\nany consequence."\r\n\r\nNow, by a vigorous effort, those who were tugging at the ropes succeeded\r\nin moving the coffin a little, and that first step was all the\r\ndifficulty, for it was loosened from the adhesive soil in which it lay,\r\nand now came up with considerable facility.\r\n\r\nThere was a half shout of satisfaction at this result, while some of the\r\ncongregation turned pale, and trembled at the prospect of the sight\r\nwhich was about to present itself; the coffin was dragged from the\r\ngrave\'s brink fairly among the long rank grass that flourished in the\r\nchurchyard, and then they all looked at it for a time, and the men who\r\nhad been most earnest in raising it wiped the perspiration from their\r\nbrows, and seemed to shrink from the task of opening that receptacle of\r\nthe dead now that it was fairly in their power so to do.\r\n\r\nEach man looked anxiously in his neighbour\'s face, and several audibly\r\nwondered why somebody else didn\'t open the coffin.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no harm in it," said one; "if he\'s a vampyre, we ought to know\r\nit; and, if he ain\'t, we can\'t do any hurt to a dead man."\r\n\r\n"Oughtn\'t we to have the service for the dead?" said one.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the impertinent boy who had before received the knock on the\r\nhead, "I think we ought to have that read backwards."\r\n\r\nThis ingenious idea was recompensed by a great many kicks and cuffs,\r\nwhich ought to have been sufficient to have warned him of the great\r\ndanger of being a little before his age in wit.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the use of shirking the job?" cried he who had been so active\r\nin shoveling the mud upon the multitude; "why, you cowardly sneaking set\r\nof humbugs, you\'re half afraid, now."\r\n\r\n"Afraid--afraid!" cried everybody: "who\'s afraid."\r\n\r\n"Ah, who\'s afraid?" said a little man, advancing, and assuming an heroic\r\nattitude; "I always notice, if anybody\'s afraid, it\'s some big fellow,\r\nwith more bones than brains."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the man to whom this reproach was more particularly\r\nlevelled, raised a horrible shout of terror, and cried out, in frantic\r\naccents,--\r\n\r\n"He\'s a-coming--he\'s a-coming!"\r\n\r\nThe little man fell at once into the grave, while the mob, with one\r\naccord, turned tail, and fled in all directions, leaving him alone with\r\nthe coffin. Such a fighting, and kicking, and scrambling ensued to get\r\nover the wall of the grave-yard, that this great fellow, who had caused\r\nall the mischief, burst into such peals of laughter that the majority of\r\nthe people became aware that it was a joke, and came creeping back,\r\nlooking as sheepish as possible.\r\n\r\nSome got up very faint sorts of laugh, and said "very good," and swore\r\nthey saw what big Dick meant from the first, and only ran to make the\r\nothers run.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Dick, "I\'m glad you enjoyed it, that\'s all. My eye,\r\nwhat a scampering there was among you. Where\'s my little friend, who was\r\nso infernally cunning about bones and brains?"\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty the little man was extricated from the grave, and\r\nthen, oh, for the consistency of a mob! they all laughed at him; those\r\nvery people who, heedless of all the amenities of existence, had been\r\ntrampling upon each other, and roaring with terror, actually had the\r\nimpudence to laugh at him, and call him a cowardly little rascal, and\r\nsay it served him right.\r\n\r\nBut such is popularity!\r\n\r\n"Well, if nobody won\'t open the coffin," said big Dick, "I will, so here\r\ngoes. I knowed the old fellow when he was alive, and many a time he\'s\r\nd----d me and I\'ve d----d him, so I ain\'t a-going to be afraid of him\r\nnow he\'s dead. We was very intimate, you see, \'cos we was the two\r\nheaviest men in the parish; there\'s a reason for everything."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Dick\'s the fellow to do it," cried a number of persons; "there\'s\r\nnobody like Dick for opening a coffin; he\'s the man as don\'t care for\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you snivelling curs," said Dick, "I hate you. If it warn\'t for my\r\nown satisfaction, and all for to prove that my old friend, the butcher,\r\nas weighed seventeen stone, and stood six feet two and-a-half on his own\r\nsole, I\'d see you all jolly well--"\r\n\r\n"D----d first," said the boy; "open the lid, Dick, let\'s have a look."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re a rum un," said Dick, "arter my own heart. I sometimes\r\nthinks as you must be a nevy, or some sort of relation of mine.\r\nHowsomdever, here goes. Who\'d a thought that I should ever had a look at\r\nold fat and thunder again?--that\'s what I used to call him; and then he\r\nused to request me to go down below, where I needn\'t turn round to light\r\nmy blessed pipe."\r\n\r\n"Hell--we know," said the boy; "why don\'t you open the lid, Dick?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a going," said Dick; "kim up."\r\n\r\nHe introduced the corner of a shovel between the lid and the coffin, and\r\ngiving it a sudden wrench, he loosened it all down one side.\r\n\r\nA shudder pervaded the multitude, and, popularly speaking, you might\r\nhave heard a pin drop in that crowded churchyard at that eventful\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nDick then proceeded to the other side, and executed the same manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n"Now for it," he said; "we shall see him in a moment, and we\'ll think we\r\nseed him still."\r\n\r\n"What a lark!" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"You hold yer jaw, will yer? Who axed you for a remark, blow yer? What\r\ndo you mean by squatting down there, like a cock-sparrow, with a pain in\r\nhis tail, hanging yer head, too, right over the coffin? Did you never\r\nhear of what they call a fluvifium coming from the dead, yer ignorant\r\nbeast, as is enough to send nobody to blazes in a minute? Get out of the\r\nway of the cold meat, will yer?"\r\n\r\n"A what, do you say, Dick?"\r\n\r\n"Request information from the extreme point of my elbow."\r\n\r\nDick threw down the spade, and laying hold of the coffin-lid with both\r\nhands, he lifted it off, and flung it on one side.\r\n\r\nThere was a visible movement and an exclamation among the multitude.\r\nSome were pushed down, in the eager desire of those behind to obtain a\r\nsight of the ghastly remains of the butcher; those at a distance were\r\nfrantic, and the excitement was momentarily increasing.\r\n\r\nThey might all have spared themselves the trouble, for the coffin was\r\nempty--here was no dead butcher, nor any evidence of one ever having\r\nbeen there, not even the grave-clothes; the only thing at all in the\r\nreceptacle of the dead was a brick.\r\n\r\nDick\'s astonishment was so intense that his eyes and mouth kept opening\r\ntogether to such an extent, that it seemed doubtful when they would\r\nreach their extreme point of elongation. He then took up the brick and\r\nlooked at it curiously, and turned it over and over, examined the ends\r\nand the sides with a critical eye, and at length he said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m blowed, here\'s a transmogrification; he\'s consolidified\r\nhimself into a blessed brick--my eye, here\'s a curiosity."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say that\'s the butcher, Dick?" said the boy.\r\n\r\nDick reached over, and gave him a tap on the head with the brick.\r\n\r\n"There!" he said, "that\'s what I calls occular demonstration. Do you\r\nbelieve it now, you blessed infidel? What\'s more natural? He was an\r\nout-and-out brick while he was alive; and he\'s turned to a brick now\r\nhe\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"Give it to me, Dick," said the boy; "I should like to have that brick,\r\njust for the fun of the thing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you turned into a pantile first. I sha\'n\'t part with this\r\nhere, it looks so blessed sensible; it\'s a gaining on me every minute as\r\na most remarkable likeness, d----d if it ain\'t."\r\n\r\nBy this time the bewilderment of the mob had subsided; now that there\r\nwas no dead butcher to look upon, they fancied themselves most\r\ngrievously injured; and, somehow or other, Dick, notwithstanding all his\r\nexertions in their service, was looked upon in the light of a showman,\r\nwho had promised some startling exhibition and then had disappointed his\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation he had of popular vengeance was a stone thrown at\r\nhim, but Dick\'s eye happened to be upon the fellow who threw it, and\r\ncollaring him in a moment, he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head,\r\nwhich confused his faculties for a week.\r\n\r\n"Hark ye," he then cried, with a loud voice, "don\'t interfere with me;\r\nyou know it won\'t go down. There\'s something wrong here; and, as one of\r\nyourselves, I\'m as much interested in finding out what it is as any of\r\nyou can possibly be. There seems to be some truth in this vampyre\r\nbusiness; our old friend, the butcher, you see, is not in his grave;\r\nwhere is he then?"\r\n\r\nThe mob looked at each other, and none attempted to answer the question.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, he\'s a vampyre," said Dick, "and you may all of you\r\nexpect to see him, in turn, come into your bed-room windows with a\r\nburst, and lay hold of you like a million and a half of leeches rolled\r\ninto one."\r\n\r\nThere was a general expression of horror, and then Dick continued,--\r\n\r\n"You\'d better all of you go home; I shall have no hand in pulling up any\r\nmore of the coffins--this is a dose for me. Of course you can do what\r\nyou like."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Pull them all up!" cried a voice; "pull them all up! Let\'s see how many\r\nvampyres there are in the churchyard."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s no business of mine," said Dick; "but I wouldn\'t, if I was\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You may depend," said one, "that Dick knows something about it, or he\r\nwouldn\'t take it so easy."\r\n\r\n"Ah! down with him," said the man who had received the box on the ears;\r\n"he\'s perhaps a vampyre himself."\r\n\r\nThe mob made a demonstration towards him, but Dick stood his ground, and\r\nthey paused again.\r\n\r\n"Now, you\'re a cowardly set," he said; "cause you\'re disappointed, you\r\nwant to come upon me. Now, I\'ll just show what a little thing will\r\nfrighten you all again, and I warn beforehand it will, so you sha\'n\'t\r\nsay you didn\'t know it, and were taken by surprise."\r\n\r\nThe mob looked at him, wondering what he was going to do.\r\n\r\n"Once! twice! thrice!" he said, and then he flung the brick up into the\r\nair an immense height, and shouted "heads," in a loud tone.\r\n\r\nA general dispersion of the crowd ensued, and the brick fell in the\r\ncentre of a very large circle indeed.\r\n\r\n"There you are again," said Dick; "why, what a nice act you are!"\r\n\r\n"What fun!" said the boy. "It\'s a famous coffin, this, Dick," and he\r\nlaid himself down in the butcher\'s last resting-place. "I never was in a\r\ncoffin before--it\'s snug enough."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re a rum \'un," said Dick; "you\'re such a inquiring genius, you\r\nis; you\'ll get your head into some hole one day, and not be able to get\r\nit out again, and then I shall see you a kicking. Hush! lay still--don\'t\r\nsay anything."\r\n\r\n"Good again," said the boy; "what shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"Give a sort of a howl and a squeak, when they\'ve all come back again."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t I!" said the boy; "pop on the lid."\r\n\r\n"There you are," said Dick; "d----d if I don\'t adopt you, and bring you\r\nup to the science of nothing."\r\n\r\n"Now, listen to me, good people all," added Dick; "I have really got\r\nsomething to say to you."\r\n\r\nAt this intimation the people slowly gathered again round the grave.\r\n\r\n"Listen," said Dick, solemnly; "it strikes me there\'s some tremendous do\r\ngoing on."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is," said several who were foremost.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be long before you\'ll all of you be most d--nably astonished;\r\nbut let me beg of all you not to accuse me of having anything to do with\r\nit, provided I tell you all I know."\r\n\r\n"No, Dick; we won\'t--we won\'t--we won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Good; then, listen. I don\'t know anything, but I\'ll tell you what I\r\nthink, and that\'s as good; I don\'t think that this brick is the butcher;\r\nbut I think, that when you least expect it--hush! come a little closer."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; we are closer."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I say, when you all least expect it, and when you ain\'t\r\ndreaming of such a thing, you\'ll hear something of my fat friend as is\r\ndead and gone, that will astonish you all."\r\n\r\nDick paused, and he gave the coffin a slight kick, as intimation to the\r\nboy that he might as well be doing his part in the drama, upon which\r\nthat ingenious young gentleman set up such a howl, that even Dick\r\njumped, so unearthly did it sound within the confines of that receptacle\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\nBut if the effect upon him was great, what must it have been upon those\r\nwhom it took completely unawares? For a moment or two they seemed\r\ncompletely paralysed, and then they frightened the boy, for the shout of\r\nterror that rose from so many throats at once was positively alarming.\r\n\r\nThis jest of Dick\'s was final, for, before three minutes had elapsed,\r\nthe churchyard was clear of all human occupants save himself and the\r\nboy, who had played his part so well in the coffin.\r\n\r\n"Get out," said Dick, "it\'s all right--we\'ve done \'em at last; and now\r\nyou may depend upon it they won\'t be in a hurry to come here again. You\r\nkeep your own counsel, or else somebody will serve you out for this. I\r\ndon\'t think you\'re altogether averse to a bit of fun, and if you keep\r\nyourself quiet, you\'ll have the satisfaction of hearing what\'s said\r\nabout this affair in every pot-house in the village, and no mistake."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING BANNERWORTH HALL, AND THE MYSTERIOUS\r\nCONDUCT OF THE ADMIRAL AND MR. CHILLINGWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt seemed now, that, by the concurrence of all parties, Bannerworth Hall\r\nwas to be abandoned; and, notwithstanding Henry was loth--as he had,\r\nindeed, from the first shown himself--to leave the ancient abode of his\r\nrace, yet, as not only Flora, but the admiral and his friend Mr.\r\nChillingworth seemed to be of opinion that it would be a prudent course\r\nto adopt, he felt that it would not become him to oppose the measure.\r\n\r\nHe, however, now made his consent to depend wholly upon the full and\r\nfree acquiescence of every member of the family.\r\n\r\n"If," he said, "there be any among us who will say to me \'Continue to\r\nkeep open the house in which we have passed so many happy hours, and let\r\nthe ancient home of our race still afford a shelter to us,\' I shall feel\r\nmyself bound to do so; but if both my mother and my brother agree to a\r\ndeparture from it, and that its hearth shall be left cold and desolate,\r\nbe it so. I will not stand in the way of any unanimous wish or\r\narrangement."\r\n\r\n"We may consider that, then, as settled," said the admiral, "for I have\r\nspoken to your brother, and he is of our opinion. Therefore, my boy, we\r\nmay all be off as soon as we can conveniently get under weigh."\r\n\r\n"But my mother?\r\n\r\n"Oh, there, I don\'t know. You must speak to her yourself. I never, if I\r\ncan help it, interfere with the women folks."\r\n\r\n"If she consent, then I am willing."\r\n\r\n"Will you ask her?"\r\n\r\n"I will not ask her to leave, because I know, then, what answer she\r\nwould at once give; but she shall hear the proposition, and I will leave\r\nher to decide upon it, unbiased in her judgment by any stated opinion of\r\nmine upon the matter."\r\n\r\n"Good. That\'ll do; and the proper way to put it, too. There\'s no mistake\r\nabout that, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nHenry, although he went through the ceremony of consulting his mother,\r\nhad no sort of doubt before he did so that she was sufficiently aware of\r\nthe feelings and wishes of Flora to be prepared to yield a ready assent\r\nto the proposition of leaving the Hall.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr. Marchdale had, from the first, been an advocate of such a\r\ncourse of proceeding, and Henry well knew how strong an influence he had\r\nover Mrs. Bannerworth\'s mind, in consequence of the respect in which she\r\nheld him as an old and valued friend.\r\n\r\nHe was, therefore, prepared for what his mother said, which was,--\r\n\r\n"My dear Henry, you know that the wishes of my children, since they have\r\nbeen grown up and capable of coming to a judgment for themselves, have\r\never been laws to me. If you, among you all, agree to leave this place,\r\ndo so."\r\n\r\n"But will you leave it freely, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Most freely I go with you all; what is it that has made this house and\r\nall its appurtenances pleasant in my eyes, but the presence in it of\r\nthose who are so dear to me? If you all leave it, you take with you the\r\nonly charms it ever possessed; so it becomes in itself as nothing. I am\r\nquite ready to accompany you all anywhere, so that we do but keep\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Then, mother, we may consider that as settled."\r\n\r\n"As you please."\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s scarcely as I please. I must confess that I would fain have clung\r\nwith a kind of superstitious reverence to this ancient abiding-place of\r\nmy race, but it may not be so. Those, perchance, who are more\r\npractically able to come to correct conclusions, in consequence of their\r\nfeelings not being sufficiently interested to lead them astray, have\r\ndecided otherwise; and, therefore, I am content to leave."\r\n\r\n"Do not grieve at it, Henry. There has hung a cloud of misfortune over\r\nus all since the garden of this house became the scene of an event which\r\nwe can none of us remember but with terror and shuddering."\r\n\r\n"Two generations of our family must live and die before the remembrance\r\nof that circumstance can be obliterated. But we will think of it no\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nThere can no doubt but that the dreadful circumstance to which both Mrs.\r\nBannerworth and Henry alluded, was the suicide of the father of the\r\nfamily in the gardens which before has been hinted at in the course of\r\nthis narration, as being a circumstance which had created a great\r\nsensation at the time, and cast a great gloom for many months over the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, doubtless, too, recollect that, at his last moments,\r\nthis unhappy individual was said to have uttered some incoherent words\r\nabout some hidden money, and that the rapid hand of death alone seemed\r\nto prevent him from being explicit upon that subject, and left it merely\r\na matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs years had rolled on, this affair, even as a subject of speculation,\r\nhad ceased to occupy the minds of any of the Bannerworth family, and\r\nseveral of their friends, among whom was Mr. Marchdale, were decidedly\r\nof opinion that the apparently pointed and mysterious words uttered,\r\nwere but the disordered wanderings of an intellect already hovering on\r\nthe confines of eternity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, far from any money, of any amount, being a disturbance to the\r\nlast moments of the dissolute man, whose vices and extravagances had\r\nbrought his family, to such ruin, it was pretty generally believed that\r\nhe had committed suicide simply from a conviction of the impossibility\r\nof raising any more supplies of cash, to enable him to carry on the\r\ncareer which he had pursued for so long.\r\n\r\nBut to resume.\r\n\r\nHenry at once communicated to the admiral what his mother had said, and\r\nthen the whole question regarding the removal being settled in the\r\naffirmative, nothing remained to be done but to set about it as quickly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe Bannerworths lived sufficiently distant from the town to be out of\r\nearshot of the disturbances which were then taking place; and so\r\ncompletely isolated were they from all sort of society, that they had no\r\nnotion of the popular disturbance which Varney the vampyre had given\r\nrise to.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following morning that Mr. Chillingworth, who had\r\nbeen home in the meantime, brought word of what had taken place, and\r\nthat great commotion was still in the town, and that the civil\r\nauthorities, finding themselves by far too weak to contend against the\r\npopular will, had sent for assistance to a garrison town, some twenty\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\nIt was a great grief to the Bannerworth family to hear these tidings,\r\nnot that they were in any way, except as victims, accessory to creating\r\nthe disturbance about the vampyre, but it seemed to promise a kind of\r\nnotoriety which they might well shrink from, and which they were just\r\nthe people to view with dislike.\r\n\r\nView the matter how we like, however, it is not to be considered as at\r\nall probable that the Bannerworth family would remain long in ignorance\r\nof what a great sensation they had created unwittingly in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe very reasons which had induced their servants to leave their\r\nestablishment, and prefer throwing themselves completely out of place,\r\nrather than remain in so ill-omened a house, were sure to be bruited\r\nabroad far and wide.\r\n\r\nAnd that, perhaps, when they came to consider of it, would suffice to\r\nform another good and substantial reason for leaving the Hall, and\r\nseeking a refuge in obscurity from the extremely troublesome sort of\r\npopularity incidental to their peculiar situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth felt uncommonly chary of telling them all that had\r\ntaken place; although he was well aware that the proceedings of the\r\nriotous mob had not terminated with the little disappointment at the old\r\nruin, to which they had so effectually chased Varney the vampyre, but to\r\nlose him so singularly when he got there.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he possessed the admiral with the uproar that was going on in\r\nthe town, for the latter did hint a little of it to Henry Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" he said to Henry, as he saw him walking in the garden; "it\r\nstrikes me if you and your ship\'s crew continue in these latitudes,\r\nyou\'ll get as notorious as the Flying Dutchman in the southern ocean."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s a sure going proverb to say, that a nod\'s as good as a wink;\r\nbut, the fact is, it\'s getting rather too well known to be pleasant,\r\nthat a vampyre has struck up rather a close acquaintance with your\r\nfamily. I understand there\'s a precious row in the town."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; bother the particulars, for I don\'t know them; but, hark ye, by\r\nto-morrow I\'ll have found a place for you to go to, so pack up the\r\nsticks, get all your stores ready to clear out, and make yourself scarce\r\nfrom this place."\r\n\r\n"I understand you," said Henry; "We have become the subject of popular\r\nrumour; I\'ve only to beg of you, admiral, that you\'ll say nothing of\r\nthis to Flora; she has already suffered enough, Heaven knows; do not let\r\nher have the additional infliction of thinking that her name is made\r\nfamiliar in every pothouse in the town."\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone for that," said the admiral. "Do you think I\'m an ass?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," said Jack Pringle, who came in at that moment, and thought the\r\nquestion was addressed to him.\r\n\r\n"Who spoke to you, you bad-looking horse-marine?"\r\n\r\n"Me a horse-marine! didn\'t you ask a plain question of a fellow, and get\r\na plain answer?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you son of a bad looking gun, what do you mean by that? I tell you\r\nwhat it is, Jack; I\'ve let you come sneaking too often on the\r\nquarter-deck, and now you come poking your fun at your officers, you\r\nrascal!"\r\n\r\n"I poking fun!" said Jack; "couldn\'t think of such a thing. I should\r\njust as soon think of you making a joke as me."\r\n\r\n"Now, I tell you what it is, I shall just strike you off the ship\'s\r\nbooks, and you shall just go and cruise by yourself; I\'ve done with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Go and tell that to the marines, if you like," said Jack. "I ain\'t done\r\nwith you yet, for a jolly long watch. Why, what do you suppose would\r\nbecome of you, you great babby, without me? Ain\'t I always a conveying\r\nyou from place to place, and steering you through all sorts of\r\ndifficulties?"\r\n\r\n"D---n your impudence!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, d---n yours."\r\n\r\n"Shiver my timbers!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, you may do what you like with your own timbers."\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t leave me?"\r\n\r\n"Sartingly not."\r\n\r\n"Come here, then?"\r\n\r\nJack might have expected a gratuity, for he advanced with alacrity.\r\n\r\n"There," said the admiral, as he laid his stick across his shoulders;\r\n"that\'s your last month\'s wages; don\'t spend it all at once."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m d----d!" said Jack; "who\'d have thought of that?--he\'s a\r\nturning rumgumtious, and no mistake. Howsomdever, I must turn it over in\r\nmy mind, and be even with him, somehow--I owes him one for that. I say,\r\nadmiral."\r\n\r\n"What now, you lubber?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; turn that over in your mind;" and away Jack walked, not quite\r\nsatisfied, but feeling, at least, that he had made a demonstration of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAs for the admiral, he considered that the thump he had given Jack with\r\nthe stick, and it was no gentle one, was a decided balancing of accounts\r\nup to that period, and as he remained likewise master of the field, he\r\nwas upon the whole very well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThese last few words which had been spoken to Henry by Admiral Bell,\r\nmore than any others, induced him to hasten his departure from\r\nBannerworth Hall; he had walked away when the altercation between Jack\r\nPringle and the admiral began, for he had seen sufficient of those wordy\r\nconflicts between those originals to be quite satisfied that neither of\r\nthem meant what he said of a discouraging character towards the other,\r\nand that far from there being any unfriendly feeling contingent upon\r\nthose little affairs, they were only a species of friendly sparring,\r\nwhich both parties enjoyed extremely.\r\n\r\nHe went direct to Flora, and he said to her,--\r\n\r\n"Since we are all agreed upon the necessity, or, at all events, upon the\r\nexpediency of a departure from the Hall, I think, sister, the sooner we\r\ncarry out that determination the better and the pleasanter for us all it\r\nwill be. Do you think you could remove so hastily as to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow! That is soon indeed."\r\n\r\n"I grant you that it is so; but Admiral Bell assures me that he will\r\nhave everything in readiness, and a place provided for us to go to by\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"Would it be possible to remove from a house like this so very quickly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sister. If you look around you, you will see that a great portion\r\nof the comforts you enjoy in this mansion belong to it as a part of its\r\nvery structure, and are not removable at pleasure; what we really have\r\nto take away is very little. The urgent want of money during our\r\nfather\'s lifetime induced him, as you may recollect even, at various\r\ntimes to part with much that was ornamental, as well as useful, which\r\nwas in the Hall. You will recollect that we seldom returned from those\r\nlittle continental tours which to us were so delightful, without finding\r\nsome old familiar objects gone, which, upon inquiry, we found had been\r\nturned into money, to meet some more than usually pressing demand."\r\n\r\n"That is true, brother; I recollect well."\r\n\r\n"So that, upon the whole, sister, there is little to remove."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, be it so. I will prepare our mother for this sudden step.\r\nBelieve me, my heart goes with it; and as a force of vengeful\r\ncircumstances have induced us to remove from this home, which was once\r\nso full of pleasant recollections, it is certainly better, as you say,\r\nthat the act should be at once consummated, than left hanging in terror\r\nover our minds."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll consider that as settled," said Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE REMOVAL FROM THE HALL.--THE NIGHT WATCH, AND THE ALARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth\'s consent having been already given to the removal, she\r\nsaid at once, when appealed to, that she was quite ready to go at any\r\ntime her children thought expedient.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Henry sought the admiral, and told him as much, at the same\r\ntime adding,--\r\n\r\n"My sister feared that we should have considerable trouble in the\r\nremoval, but I have convinced her that such will not be the case, as we\r\nare by no means overburdened with cumbrous property."\r\n\r\n"Cumbrous property," said the admiral, "why, what do you mean? I beg\r\nleave to say, that when I took the house, I took the table and chairs\r\nwith it. D--n it, what good do you suppose an empty house is to me?"\r\n\r\n"The tables and chairs!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I took the house just as it stands. Don\'t try and bamboozle me out\r\nof it. I tell you, you\'ve nothing to move but yourselves and immediate\r\npersonal effects."\r\n\r\n"I was not aware, admiral, that that was your plan."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, now you are, listen to me. I\'ve circumvented the enemy too\r\noften not to know how to get up a plot. Jack and I have managed it all.\r\nTo-morrow evening, after dark, and before the moon\'s got high enough to\r\nthrow any light, you and your brother, and Miss Flora and your mother,\r\nwill come out of the house, and Jack and I will lead you where you\'re to\r\ngo to. There\'s plenty of furniture where you\'re a-going, and so you will\r\nget off free, without anybody knowing anything about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, admiral, I\'ve said it before, and it is the unanimous opinion of\r\nus all, that everything should be left to you. You have proved yourself\r\ntoo good a friend to us for us to hesitate at all in obeying your\r\ncommands. Arrange everything, I pray you, according to your wishes and\r\nfeelings, and you will find there shall be no cavilling on our parts."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right; there\'s nothing like giving a command to some one person.\r\nThere\'s no good done without. Now I\'ll manage it all. Mind you, seven\r\no\'clock to-morrow evening everything is to be ready, and you will all be\r\nprepared to leave the Hall."\r\n\r\n"It shall be so."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that giving such a thundering ring at the gate?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, I know not. We have few visitors and no servants, so I must e\'en\r\nbe my own gate porter."\r\n\r\nHenry walked to the gate, and having opened it, a servant in a handsome\r\nlivery stepped a pace or two into the garden.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Henry Bannerworth within, or Admiral Bell?"\r\n\r\n"Both," cried the admiral. "I\'m Admiral Bell, and this is Mr. Henry\r\nBannerworth. What do you want with us, you d----d gingerbread-looking\r\nflunkey?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, my master desires his compliments--his very best compliments--and\r\nhe wants to know how you are after your flurry."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"After your--a--a--flurry and excitement."\r\n\r\n"Who is your master?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"The devil!" said the admiral; "if that don\'t beat all the impudence I\r\never came near. Our flurry! Ah! I like that fellow. Just go and tell\r\nhim--"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Henry, interposing, "send back no message. Say to your\r\nmaster, fellow, that Mr. Henry Bannerworth feels that not only has he no\r\nclaim to Sir Francis Varney\'s courtesy, but that he would rather be\r\nwithout it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ha!" said the footman, adjusting his collar; "very good. This seems\r\na d----d, old-fashioned, outlandish place of yours. Any ale?"\r\n\r\n"Now, shiver my hulks!" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!" said Henry; "who knows but there may be a design in this?\r\nWe have no ale."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! dem!--dry as dust, by God! What does the old commodore say? Any\r\nmessage, my ancient Greek?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said the admiral; "bless you, nothing. What did you\r\ngive for that waistcoat, d--n you? Ha! ha! you\'re a clever fellow."\r\n\r\n"Ah! the old gentleman\'s ill. However, I\'ll take back his compliments,\r\nand that he\'s much obliged at Sir Francis\'s condescension. At the same\r\ntime, I suppose may place in my eye what I may get out of either of you,\r\nwithout hindering me seeing my way back. Ha! ha! Adieu--adieu."\r\n\r\n"Bravo!" said the admiral; "that\'s it--go it--now for it. D--n it, it is\r\na _do!_"\r\n\r\nThe admiral\'s calmness during the latter part of the dialogue arose from\r\nthe fact that over the flunkey\'s shoulder, and at some little distance\r\noff, he saw Jack Pringle taking off his jacket, and rolling up his\r\nsleeves in that deliberate sort of way that seemed to imply a\r\ndetermination of setting about some species of work that combined the\r\npleasant with the useful.\r\n\r\nJack executed many nods to and winks at the livery-servant, and jerked\r\nhis thumb likewise in the direction of a pump near at hand, in a manner\r\nthat spoke as plainly as possible, that John was to be pumped upon.\r\n\r\nAnd now the conference was ended, and Sir Francis\'s messenger turned to\r\ngo; but Jack Pringle bothered him completely, for he danced round him in\r\nsuch a singular manner, that, turn which way he would, there stood Jack\r\nPringle, in some grotesque attitude, intercepting him; and so he edged\r\nhim on, till he got him to the pump.\r\n\r\n"Jack," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pump on that fellow now."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir; give us a hand."\r\n\r\nJack laid hold of him by the two ears, and holding him under the pump,\r\nkicked his shins until he completely gathered himself beneath the spout.\r\nIt was in vain that he shouted "Murder! help! fire! thieves!" Jack was\r\ninexorable, and the admiral pumped.\r\n\r\nJack turned the fellow\'s head about in a very scientific manner, so as\r\nto give him a fair dose of hydropathic treatment, and in a few minutes,\r\nnever was human being more thoroughly saturated with moisture than was\r\nSir Francis Varney\'s servant. He had left off hallooing for aid, for he\r\nfound that whenever he did so, Jack held his mouth under the spout,\r\nwhich was decidedly unpleasant; so, with a patience that looked like\r\nheroic fortitude, he was compelled to wait until the admiral was tired\r\nof pumping.\r\n\r\n"Very good," at length he said. "Now, Jack, for fear this fellow catcher\r\ncold, be so good as to get a horsewhip, and see him off the premises\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack. "And I say, old fellow, you can take back all\r\nour blessed compliments now, and say you\'ve been flurried a little\r\nyourself; and if so be as you came here as dry as dust, d----e, you go\r\nback as wet as a mop. Won\'t it do to kick him out, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Very well--as you please, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Then here goes;" and Jack proceeded to kick the shivering animal from\r\nthe garden with a vehemence that soon convinced him of the necessity of\r\ngetting out of it as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nHow it was that Sir Francis Varney, after the fearful race he had had,\r\ngot home again across the fields, free from all danger, and back to his\r\nown house, from whence he sent so cool and insolent a message, they\r\ncould not conceive.\r\n\r\nBut such must certainly be the fact; somehow or another, he had escaped\r\nall danger, and, with a calm insolence peculiar to the man, he had no\r\ndoubt adopted the present mode of signifying as much to the\r\nBannerworths.\r\n\r\nThe insolence of his servant was, no doubt, a matter of pre-arrangement\r\nwith that individual, however he might have set about it con amore. As\r\nfor the termination of the adventure, that, of course, had not been at\r\nall calculated upon; but, like most tools of other people\'s insolence or\r\nambition, the insolence of the underling had received both his own\r\npunishment and his master\'s.\r\n\r\nWe know quite enough of Sir Francis Varney to feel assured that he would\r\nrather consider it as a good jest than otherwise of his footman, so that\r\nwith the suffering he endured at the Bannerworths\', and the want of\r\nsympathy he was likely to find at home, that individual had certainly\r\nnothing to congratulate himself upon but the melancholy reminiscence of\r\nhis own cleverness.\r\n\r\nBut were the mob satisfied with what had occurred in the churchyard?\r\nThey were not, and that night was to witness the perpetration of a\r\nmelancholy outrage, such as the history of the time presents no parallel\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe finding of a brick in the coffin of the butcher, instead of the body\r\nof that individual, soon spread as a piece of startling intelligence all\r\nover the place; and the obvious deduction that was drawn from the\r\ncircumstance, seemed to be that the deceased butcher was unquestionably\r\na vampyre, and out upon some expedition at the time when his coffin was\r\nsearched.\r\n\r\nHow he had originally got out of that receptacle for the dead was\r\ncertainly a mystery; but the story was none the worse for that. Indeed,\r\nan ingenious individual found a solution for that part of the business,\r\nfor, as he said, nothing was more natural, when anybody died who was\r\ncapable of becoming a vampyre, than for other vampyres who knew it to\r\ndig him up, and lay him out in the cold beams of the moonlight, until he\r\nacquired the same sort of vitality they themselves possessed, and joined\r\ntheir horrible fraternity.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a better explanation--and, after all, it was no bad one--this\r\ntheory was generally received, and, with a shuddering horror, people\r\nasked themselves, if the whole of the churchyard were excavated, how\r\nmany coffins would be found tenantless by the dead which had been\r\nsupposed, by simple-minded people, to inhabit them.\r\n\r\nThe presence, however, of a body of dragoons, towards evening,\r\neffectually prevented any renewed attack upon the sacred precincts of\r\nthe churchyard, and it was a strange and startling thing to see that\r\ncountry town under military surveillance, and sentinels posted at its\r\nprincipal buildings.\r\n\r\nThis measure smothered the vengeance of the crowd, and insured, for a\r\ntime, the safety of Sir Francis Varney; for no considerable body of\r\npersons could assemble for the purpose of attacking his house again,\r\nwithout being followed; so such a step was not attempted.\r\n\r\nIt had so happened, however, that on that very day, the funeral of a\r\nyoung man was to have taken place, who had put up for a time at that\r\nsame inn where Admiral Bell was first introduced to the reader. He had\r\nbecome seriously ill, and, after a few days of indisposition, which had\r\npuzzled the country practitioners, breathed his last.\r\n\r\nHe was to have been buried in the village churchyard on the very day of\r\nthe riot and confusion incidental to the exhumation of the coffin of the\r\nbutcher, and probably from that circumstance we may deduce the presence\r\nof the clergyman in canonicals at the period of the riot.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that so disorderly a mob possessed the churchyard, the\r\nidea of burying the stranger on that day was abandoned; but still all\r\nwould have gone on quietly as regarded him, had it not been for the\r\nfolly of one of the chamber-maids at the tavern.\r\n\r\nThis woman, with all the love of gossip incidental to her class, had,\r\nfrom the first, entered so fully into all the particulars concerning\r\nvampyres, that she fairly might be considered to be a little deranged on\r\nthat head. Her imagination had been so worked upon, that she was in an\r\nunfit state to think of anything else, and if ever upon anybody a stern\r\nand revolting superstition was calculated to produce direful effects, it\r\nwas upon this woman.\r\n\r\nThe town was tolerably quiet; the presence of the soldiery had\r\nfrightened some and amused others, and no doubt the night would have\r\npassed off serenely, had she not suddenly rushed into the street, and,\r\nwith bewildered accents and frantic gestures shouted,--\r\n\r\n"A vampyre--a vampyre--a vampyre!"\r\n\r\nThese words soon collected a crowd around her, and then, with screaming\r\naccents, which would have been quite enough to convince any reflecting\r\nperson that she had actually gone distracted upon that point, she\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n"Come into the house--come into the house! Look upon the dead body, that\r\nshould have been in its grave; it\'s fresher now than it was the day on\r\nwhich it died, and there\'s a colour in its cheeks! A vampyre--a\r\nvampyre--a vampyre! Heaven save us from a vampyre!"\r\n\r\nThe strange, infuriated, maniacal manner in which these words were\r\nuttered, produced an astonishingly exciting effect among the mob.\r\nSeveral women screamed, and some few fainted. The torch was laid again\r\nto the altar of popular feeling, and the fierce flame of superstition\r\nburnt brightly and fiercely.\r\n\r\nSome twenty or thirty persons, with shouts and exclamations, rushed into\r\nthe inn, while the woman who had created the disturbance still continued\r\nto rave, tearing her hair, and shrieking at intervals, until she fell\r\nexhausted upon the pavement.\r\n\r\nSoon, from a hundred throats, rose the dreadful cry of "A vampyre--a\r\nvampyre!" The alarm was given throughout the whole town; the bugles of\r\nthe military sounded; there was a clash of arms--the shrieks of women;\r\naltogether, the premonitory symptoms of such a riot as was not likely to\r\nbe quelled without bloodshed and considerable disaster.\r\n\r\nIt is truly astonishing the effect which one weak or vicious-minded\r\nperson can produce upon a multitude.\r\n\r\nHere was a woman whose opinion would have been accounted valueless upon\r\nthe most common-place subject, and whose word would not have passed for\r\ntwopence, setting a whole town by the ears by force of nothing but her\r\nsheer brutal ignorance.\r\n\r\nIt is a notorious physiological fact, that after four or five days, or\r\neven a week, the bodies of many persons assume an appearance of\r\nfreshness, such as might have been looked for in vain immediately after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most insidious processes of that decay which appears to\r\nregret with its\r\n\r\n     "----------- offensive fingers, To mar the lines where beauty\r\n     lingers."\r\n\r\nBut what did the chamber-maid know of physiology? Probably, she would\r\nhave asked if it was anything good to eat; and so, of course, having her\r\nhead full of vampyres, she must needs produce so lamentable a scene of\r\nconfusion, the results of which we almost sicken at detailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STAKE AND THE DEAD BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mob seemed from the first to have an impression that, as regarded\r\nthe military force, no very serious results would arise from that\r\nquarter, for it was not to be supposed that, on an occasion which could\r\nnot possibly arouse any ill blood on the part of the soldiery, or on\r\nwhich they could have the least personal feeling, they would like to get\r\na bad name, which would stick to them for years to come.\r\n\r\nIt was no political riot, on which men might be supposed, in consequence\r\nof differing in opinion, to have their passions inflamed; so that,\r\nalthough the call of the civil authorities for military aid had been\r\nacceded to, yet it was hoped, and, indeed, almost understood by the\r\nofficers, that their operations would lie confined more to a\r\ndemonstration of power, than anything else.\r\n\r\nBesides, some of the men had got talking to the townspeople, and had\r\nheard all about the vampyre story, and not being of the most refined or\r\neducated class themselves, they felt rather interested than otherwise in\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, then, we are inclined to think, that the\r\ndisorderly mob of that inn had not so wholesome a fear as it was most\r\ncertainly intended they should have of the redcoats. Then, again, they\r\nwere not attacking the churchyard, which, in the first case, was the\r\nmain point in dispute, and about which the authorities had felt so very\r\nsore, inasmuch as they felt that, if once the common people found out\r\nthat the sanctity of such places could be outraged with impunity, they\r\nwould lose their reverence for the church; that is to say, for the host\r\nof persons who live well and get fat in this country by the trade of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nConsequently, this churchyard was the main point of defence, and it was\r\nzealously looked to when it need not have been done so, while the\r\npublic-house where there really reigned mischief was half unguarded.\r\n\r\nThere are always in all communities, whether large or small, a number of\r\npersons who really have, or fancy they have, something to gain by\r\ndisturbance. These people, of course, care not for what pretext the\r\npublic peace is violated; so long as there is a row, and something like\r\nan excuse for running into other people\'s houses, they are satisfied.\r\n\r\nTo get into a public-house under such circumstances is an unexpected\r\ntreat; and thus, when the mob rushed into the inn with such symptoms of\r\nfury and excitement, there went with the leaders of the disturbance a\r\nnumber of persons who never thought of getting further than the bar,\r\nwhere they attacked the spirit-taps with an alacrity which showed how\r\ngreat was their love for ardent compounds.\r\n\r\nLeaving these persons behind, however, we will follow those who, with a\r\nreal superstition, and a furious interest in the affair of the vampyre,\r\nmade their way towards the upper chamber, determining to satisfy\r\nthemselves if there were truth in the statement so alarmingly made by\r\nthe woman who had created such an emotion.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing what people will do in crowds, in comparison with the\r\nacts that they would be able to commit individually. There is usually a\r\ncalmness, a sanctity, a sublimity about death, which irresistibly\r\ninduces a respect for its presence, alike from the educated or from the\r\nilliterate; and let the object of the fell-destroyer\'s presence be whom\r\nit may, the very consciousness that death has claimed it for its own,\r\ninvests it with a halo of respect, that, in life, the individual could\r\nnever aspire to probably.\r\n\r\nLet us precede these furious rioters for a few moments, and look upon\r\nthe chamber of the dead--that chamber, which for a whole week, had been\r\nlooked upon with a kind of shuddering terror--that chamber which had\r\nbeen darkened by having its sources of light closed, as if it were a\r\nkind of disrespect to the dead to allow the pleasant sunshine to fall\r\nupon the faded form.\r\n\r\nAnd every inhabitant of that house, upon ascending and descending its\r\nintricate and ancient staircases, had walked with a quiet and subdued\r\nstep past that one particular door.\r\n\r\nEven the tones of voice in which they spoke to each other, while they\r\nknew that that sad remnant of mortality was in the house, was quiet and\r\nsubdued, as if the repose of death was but a mortal sleep, and could be\r\nbroken by rude sounds.\r\n\r\nAy, even some of these very persons, who now with loud and boisterous\r\nclamour, had rushed into the place, had visited the house and talked in\r\nwhispers; but then they were alone, and men will do in throngs acts\r\nwhich, individually, they would shrink from with compunction or\r\ncowardice, call it which we will.\r\n\r\nThe chamber of death is upon the second story of the house. It is a back\r\nroom, the windows of which command a view of that half garden, half\r\nfarm-yard, which we find generally belonging to country inns.\r\n\r\nBut now the shutters were closed, with the exception of one small\r\nopening, that, in daylight, would have admitted a straggling ray of\r\nlight to fall upon the corpse. Now, however, that the sombre shades of\r\nevening had wrapped everything in gloom, the room appeared in total\r\ndarkness, so that the most of those adventurers who had ventured into\r\nthe place shrunk back until lights were procured from the lower part of\r\nthe house, with which to enter the room.\r\n\r\nA dim oil lamp in a niche sufficiently lighted the staircase, and, by\r\nthe friendly aid of its glimmering beams, they had found their way up to\r\nthe landing tolerably well, and had not thought of the necessity of\r\nhaving lights with which to enter the apartments, until they found them\r\nin utter darkness.\r\n\r\nThese requisites, however, were speedily procured from the kitchen of\r\nthe inn. Indeed, anything that was wanted was laid hold of without the\r\nleast word of remark to the people of the place, as if might, from that\r\nevening forthwith, was understood to constitute right, in that town.\r\n\r\nUp to this point no one had taken a very prominent part in the attack\r\nupon the inn if attack it could be called; but now the man whom chance,\r\nor his own nimbleness, made the first of the throng, assumed to himself\r\na sort of control over his companions and, turning to them, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Hark ye, my friends; we\'ll do everything quietly and properly; so I\r\nthink we\'d better three or four of us go in at once, arm-in-arm."\r\n\r\n"Psha!" cried one who had just arrived with a light; "it\'s your\r\ncowardice that speaks. I\'ll go in first; let those follow me who like,\r\nand those who are afraid may remain where they are."\r\n\r\nHe at once dashed into the room, and this immediately broke the spell of\r\nfear which was beginning to creep over the others in consequence of the\r\ntimid suggestion of the man who, up to that moment, had been first and\r\nforemost in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the chamber was half filled with persons, four or five of\r\nwhom carried lights; so that, as it was not of very large dimensions, it\r\nwas sufficiently illuminated for every object in it to be clearly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThere was the bed, smooth and unruffled, as if waiting for some expected\r\nguest; while close by its side a coffin, supported upon tressles, over\r\nwhich a sheet was partially thrown, contained the sad remains of him who\r\nlittle expected in life that, after death, he should be stigmatised as\r\nan example of one of the ghastliest superstitions that ever found a home\r\nin the human imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that some one had been in the room; and that this was the\r\nwoman whose excited fancy had led her to look upon the face of the\r\ncorpse there could be no doubt, for the sheet was drawn aside just\r\nsufficiently to discover the countenance.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the stranger was unknown at the inn, or probably ere\r\nthis the coffin lid would have been screwed on; but it was hoped, up to\r\nthe last moment, as advertisements had been put into the county papers,\r\nthat some one would come forward to identify and claim him.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, had not been the case, and so his funeral had been\r\ndetermined upon.\r\n\r\nThe presence of so many persons at once effectually prevented any\r\nindividual from exhibiting, even if he felt any superstitious fears\r\nabout approaching the coffin; and so, with one accord, they surrounded\r\nit, and looked upon the face of the dead.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing repulsive in that countenance. The fact was that\r\ndecomposition had sufficiently advanced to induce a relaxation of the\r\nmuscles, and a softening of the fibres, so that an appearance of\r\ncalmness and repose had crept over the face which it did not wear\r\nimmediately after death.\r\n\r\nIt happened, too, that the face was full of flesh--for the death had\r\nbeen sudden, and there had not been that wasting away of the muscles and\r\ninteguments which makes the skin cling, as it were, to the bone, when\r\nthe ravages of long disease have exhausted the physical frame.\r\n\r\nThere was, unquestionably, a plumpness, a freshness, and a sort of\r\nvitality about the countenance that was remarkable.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was a death-like stillness in the apartment, and\r\nthen one voice broke the silence by exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"He\'s a vampyre, and has come here to die. Well he knows he\'d be taken\r\nup by Sir Francis Varney, and become one of the crew."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," cried several voices at once; "a vampyre! a vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Hold a moment," cried one; "let us find somebody in the house who has\r\nseen him some days ago, and then we can ascertain if there\'s any\r\ndifference in his looks."\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was agreed to, and a couple of stout men ran down\r\nstairs, and returned in a few moments with a trembling waiter, whom they\r\nhad caught in the passage, and forced to accompany them.\r\n\r\nThis man seemed to think that he was to be made a dreadful example of in\r\nsome sort of way; and, as he was dragged into the room, he trembled, and\r\nlooked as pale as death.\r\n\r\n"What have I done, gentlemen?" he said; "I ain\'t a vampyre. Don\'t be\r\ndriving a stake through me. I assure you, gentlemen, I\'m only a waiter,\r\nand have been for a matter of five-and-twenty years."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be done no harm to," said one of his captors; "you\'ve only got\r\nto answer a question that will be put to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, certainly, gentlemen; anything you please. Coming--coming, as\r\nI always say; give your orders, the waiter\'s in the room."\r\n\r\n"Look upon the fare of that corpse."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly--directly."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen it before?"\r\n\r\n"Seen it before! Lord bless you! yes, a dozen of times. I seed him afore\r\nhe died, and I seed him arter; and when the undertaker\'s men came, I\r\ncame up with them and I seed \'em put him in his coffin. You see I kept\r\nan eye on \'em, gentlemen, \'cos knows well enough what they is. A cousin\r\nof mine was in the trade, and he assures me as one of \'em always brings\r\na tooth-drawing concern in his pocket, and looks in the mouth of the\r\nblessed corpse to see if there\'s a blessed tooth worth pulling out."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue," said one; "we want none of your nonsense. Do you see\r\nany difference now in the face of the corpse to what it was some days\r\nsince?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know; somehow, it don\'t look so rum."\r\n\r\n"Does it look fresher?"\r\n\r\n"Well, somehow or another, now you mention it, it\'s very odd, but it\r\ndoes."\r\n\r\n"Enough," cried the man who had questioned him, with considerable\r\nexcitement of manner. "Neighbours, are we to have our wives and our\r\nchildren scared to death by vampyres?"\r\n\r\n"No--no!" cried everybody.\r\n\r\n"Is not this, then, one of that dreadful order of beings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes; what\'s to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Drive a stake through the body, and so prevent the possibility of\r\nanything in the shape of a restoration."\r\n\r\nThis was a terrific proposition; and even those who felt most strongly\r\nupon the subject, and had their fears most awakened, shrank from\r\ncarrying it into effect. Others, again, applauded it, although they\r\ndetermined, in their own minds, to keep far enough off from the\r\nexecution of the job, which they hoped would devolve upon others, so\r\nthat they might have all the security of feeling that such a process had\r\nbeen gone through with the supposed vampyre, without being in any way\r\ncommitted by the dreadful act.\r\n\r\nNothing was easier than to procure a stake from the garden in the rear\r\nof the premises; but it was one thing to have the means at hand of\r\ncarrying into effect so dreadful a proposition, and another actually to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nFor the credit of human nature, we regret that even then, when\r\ncivilisation and popular education had by no means made such rapid\r\nstrides as in our times they have, such a proposition should be\r\nentertained for a moment: but so it was; and just as an alarm was given\r\nthat a party of the soldiers had reached the inn and had taken\r\npossession of the doorway with a determination to arrest the rioters, a\r\nstrong hedge-stake had been procured, and everything was in readiness\r\nfor the perpetration of the horrible deed.\r\n\r\nEven then those in the room, for they were tolerably sober, would have\r\nrevolted, probably, from the execution of so fearful an act; but the\r\nentrance of a party of the military into the lower portion of the\r\ntavern, induced those who had been making free with the strong liquors\r\nbelow, to make a rush up-stairs to their companions with the hope of\r\nescaping detection of the petty larceny, if they got into trouble on\r\naccount of the riot.\r\n\r\nThese persons, infuriated by drink, were capable of anything, and to\r\nthem, accordingly, the more sober parties gladly surrendered the\r\ndisagreeable job of rendering the supposed vampyre perfectly innoxious,\r\nby driving a hedge-stake through his body--a proceeding which, it was\r\ncurrently believed, inflicted so much physical injury to the frame, as\r\nto render his resuscitation out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe cries of alarm from below, joined now to the shouts of those mad\r\nrioters, produced a scene of dreadful confusion.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, for we revolt at the office, describe particularly the\r\ndreadful outrage which was committed upon the corpse; suffice it that\r\ntwo or three, maddened by drink, and incited by the others, plunged the\r\nhedge-stake through the body, and there left it, a sickening and\r\nhorrible spectacle to any one who might cast his eyes upon it.\r\n\r\nWith such violence had the frightful and inhuman deed been committed,\r\nthat the bottom of the coffin was perforated by the stake so that the\r\ncorpse was actually nailed to its last earthly tenement.\r\n\r\nSome asserted, that at that moment an audible groan came from the dead\r\nman, and that this arose from the extinguishment of that remnant of life\r\nwhich remained in him, on account of his being a vampyre, and which\r\nwould have been brought into full existence, if the body had been placed\r\nin the rays of the moon, when at its full, according to the popular\r\nsuperstition upon that subject.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, were quite ready to swear that at the moment the stake\r\nwas used there was a visible convulsion of all the limbs, and that the\r\ncountenance, before so placid and so calm, became immediately distorted,\r\nas if with agony.\r\n\r\nBut we have done with these horrible surmises; the dreadful deed has\r\nbeen committed, and wild, ungovernable superstition has had, for a time,\r\nits sway over the ignorant and debased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE MOB\'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S.--THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN\r\nADMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe soldiery had been sent for from their principal station near the\r\nchurchyard, and had advanced with some degree of reluctance to quell\r\nwhat they considered as nothing better nor worse than a drunken brawl at\r\na public-house, which they really considered they ought not to be called\r\nto interfere with.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the party reached the spot, and heard what a confusion\r\nthere was, and saw in what numbers the rioters were assembling, it\r\nbecame evident to them that the case was of a more serious complexion\r\nthan they had at first imagined, and consequently they felt that their\r\nprofessional dignity was not so much compromised with their interference\r\nwith the lawless proceedings.\r\n\r\nSome of the constabulary of the town were there, and to them the\r\nsoldiers promised they would hand what prisoners they took, at the same\r\ntime that they made a distinct condition that they were not to be\r\ntroubled with their custody, nor in any way further annoyed in the\r\nbusiness beyond taking care that they did not absolutely escape, after\r\nbeing once secured.\r\n\r\nThis was all that the civil authorities of the town required, and, in\r\nfact, they hoped that, after making prisoners of a few of the\r\nringleaders of the riotous proceedings, the rest would disperse, and\r\nprevent the necessity of capturing them.\r\n\r\nBe it known, however, that both military and civil authorities were\r\ncompletely ignorant of the dreadful outrage against all common decency,\r\nwhich had been committed within the public-house.\r\n\r\nThe door was well guarded, and the question now was how the rioters were\r\nto be made to come down stairs, and be captured; and this was likely to\r\nremain a question, so long as no means were adopted to make them\r\ndescend. So that, after a time, it was agreed that a couple of troopers\r\nshould march up stairs with a constable, to enable him to secure any one\r\nwho seemed a principal in the riot.\r\n\r\nBut this only had the effect of driving those who were in the\r\nsecond-floor, and saw the approach of the two soldiers, whom they\r\nthought were backed by the whole of their comrades, up a narrow\r\nstaircase, to a third-floor, rather consisting of lofts than of actual\r\nrooms; but still, for the time, it was a refuge; and owing to the\r\nextreme narrowness of the approach to it, which consisted of nearly a\r\nperpendicular staircase, with any degree of tact or method, it might\r\nhave been admirably defended.\r\n\r\nIn the hurry and scramble, all the lights were left behind; and when the\r\ntwo soldiers and constables entered the room where the corpse had lain,\r\nthey became, for the first time, aware of what a horrible purpose had\r\nbeen carried out by the infuriated mob.\r\n\r\nThe sight was one of perfect horror, and hardened to scenes which might\r\nstrike other people as being somewhat of the terrific as these soldiers\r\nmight be supposed to be by their very profession, they actually sickened\r\nat the sight which the mutilated corpse presented, and turned aside with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nThese feelings soon gave way to anger and animosity against the crowd\r\nwho could be guilty of such an atrocious outrage; and, for the first\r\ntime, a strong and interested vengeance against the mob pervaded the\r\nbreasts of those who were brought to act against it.\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers ran down stairs to the door, and reported the scene\r\nwhich was to be seen above. A determination was instantly come to, to\r\ncapture as many as possible of those who had been concerned in so\r\ndiabolical an outrage, and leaving a guard of five men at the door, the\r\nremainder of the party ascended the staircase, determined upon storming\r\nthe last refuge of the rioters, and dragging them to justice.\r\n\r\nThe report, however, of these proceedings that were taking place at the\r\ninn, spread quickly over the whole town; and soon as large a mob of the\r\ndisorderly and the idle as the place could at all afford was assembled\r\noutside the inn.\r\n\r\nThis mob appeared, for a time, inertly to watch the proceedings. It\r\nseemed rather a hazardous thing to interfere with the soldiers, whose\r\ncarbines look formidable and troublesome weapons.\r\n\r\nWith true mob courage, therefore, they left the minority of their\r\ncomrades, who were within the house, to their fate; and after a\r\nwhispered conference from one to the other, they suddenly turned in a\r\nbody, and began to make for the outskirts of the town.\r\n\r\nThey then separated, as if by common consent, and straggled out into the\r\nopen country by twos and threes, consolidating again into a mass when\r\nthey had got some distance off, and clear of any exertions that could be\r\nmade by the soldiery to stay them.\r\n\r\nThe cry then rose of "Down with Sir Francis Varney--slay him--burn his\r\nhouse--death to all vampyres!" and, at a rapid pace, they proceeded in\r\nthe direction of his mansion.\r\n\r\nWe will leave this mob, however, for the present, and turn our attention\r\nto those who are at the inn, and are certainly in a position of some\r\njeopardy. Their numbers were not great, and they were unarmed;\r\ncertainly, their best chance would have been to have surrendered at\r\ndiscretion; but that was a measure which, if the sober ones had felt\r\ninclined to, those who were infuriated and half maddened with drink\r\nwould not have acceded to on any account.\r\n\r\nA furious resistance was, therefore, fairly to be expected; and what\r\nmeans the soldiery were likely to use for the purpose of storming this\r\nlast retreat was a matter of rather anxious conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a regular enemy, there would not, perhaps, have been much\r\ndifficulty; but here the capture of certain persons, and not their\r\ndestruction, was the object; and how that was to be accomplished by fair\r\nmeans, certainly was a question which nobody felt very competent to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nDetermination, however, will do wonders; and although the rioters\r\nnumbered over forty, notwithstanding all their desertions, and not above\r\nseventeen or eighteen soldiers marched into the inn, we shall perceive\r\nthat they succeeded in accomplishing their object without any\r\nmanoeuvring at all.\r\n\r\nThe space in which the rioters were confined was low, narrow, and\r\ninconvenient, as well as dark, for the lights on the staircase cast up\r\nthat height but very insufficient rays.\r\n\r\nWeapons of defence they found but very few, and yet there were some\r\nwhich, to do them but common credit, they used as effectually as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThese attics, or lofts, were used as lumber-rooms, and had been so for\r\nyears, so that there was a collection of old boxes, broken pieces of\r\nfurniture, and other matters, which will, in defiance of everything and\r\neverybody, collect in a house.\r\n\r\nThese were formidable means of defence, if not of offence, down a very\r\nnarrow staircase, had they been used with judgment.\r\n\r\nSome of the rioters, who were only just drunk enough to be fool-hardy,\r\ncollected a few of these articles at the top of the staircase, and swore\r\nthey would smash anybody who should attempt to come up to them, a threat\r\neasier uttered than executed.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, after all, if their position had been ever so impregnable,\r\nthey must come down eventually, or be starved out.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers were not at liberty to adopt so slow a process of\r\novercoming their enemy, and up the second-floor staircase they went,\r\nwith a determination of making short work of the business.\r\n\r\nThey paused a moment, by word of command, on the landing, and then,\r\nafter this slight pause, the word was given to advance.\r\n\r\nNow when men will advance, in spite of anything and everything, it is no\r\neasy matter to stop them, and he who was foremost among the military\r\nwould as soon thought of hesitating to ascend the narrow staircase\r\nbefore him, when ordered so to do, as paying the national debt. On he\r\nwent, and down came a great chest, which, falling against his feet,\r\nknocked him down as he attempted to scramble over it.\r\n\r\n"Fire," said the officer; and it appeared that he had made some\r\narrangements as to how the order was to be obeyed, for the second man\r\nfired his carbine, and then scrambled over his prostrate comrade; after\r\nwhich he stooped, and the third fired his carbine likewise, and then\r\nhurried forward in the same manner.\r\n\r\nAt the first sound of the fire arms the rioters were taken completely by\r\nsurprise; they had not had the least notion of affairs getting to such a\r\nlength. The smell of the powder, the loud report, and the sensation of\r\npositive danger that accompanied these phenomena, alarmed them most\r\nterrifically; so that, in point of fact, with the exception of the empty\r\nchest that was thrown down in the way of the first soldier, no further\r\nidea of defence seemed in any way to find a place in the hearts of the\r\nbesieged.\r\n\r\nThey scrambled one over the other in their eagerness to get as far as\r\npossible from immediate danger, which, of course, they conceived existed\r\nin the most imminent degree the nearest to the door.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of terror into which they were thrown, that each one\r\nat the moment believed himself shot, and the soldiers had overcome all\r\nthe real difficulties in getting possession of what might thus be called\r\nthe citadel of the inn, before those men who had been so valorous a\r\nshort time since recovered from the tremendous fright into which they\r\nhad been thrown.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly say that the carbines were loaded, but with blank\r\ncartridges, for there was neither a disposition nor a necessity for\r\ntaking the lives of these misguided people.\r\n\r\nIf was the suddenness and the steadiness of the attack that had done all\r\nthe mischief to their cause; and now, ere they recovered from the\r\nsurprise of having their position so completely taken by storm, they\r\nwere handed down stairs, one by one, from soldier to soldier, and into\r\nthe custody of the civil authorities.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the safe keeping of large a body of prisoners, the\r\nconstables, who were in a great minority, placed handcuffs upon some of\r\nthe most capable of resistance; so what with those who were thus\r\nsecured, and those who were terrified into submission, there was not a\r\nman of all the lot who had taken refuge in the attics of the\r\npublic-house but was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of fire-arms, the women who were outside the inn had, of\r\ncourse, raised a most prodigious clamour.\r\n\r\nThey believed directly that every bullet must have done some most\r\nserious mischief to the townspeople, and it was only upon one of the\r\nsoldiers, a non-commissioned officer, who was below, assuring them of\r\nthe innoxious nature of the proceeding which restored anything like\r\nequanimity.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" he cried: "what are you howling about? Do you fancy that\r\nwe\'ve nothing better to do than to shoot a parcel of fellows that are\r\nnot worth the bullets that would be lodged in their confounded\r\ncarcases?"\r\n\r\n"But we heard the gun," said a woman.\r\n\r\n"Of course you did; it\'s the powder that makes the noise, not the\r\nbullet. You\'ll see them all brought out safe wind and limb."\r\n\r\nThis assurance satisfied the women to a certain extent, and such had\r\nbeen their fear that they should have had to look upon the spectacle of\r\ndeath, or of grievous wounds, that they were comparatively quite\r\nsatisfied when they saw husbands, fathers, and brothers, only in the\r\ncustody of the town officers.\r\n\r\nAnd very sheepish some of the fellows looked, when they were handed down\r\nand handcuffed, and the more especially when they had been routed only\r\nby a few blank cartridges--that sixpenny worth of powder had defeated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey were marched off to the town gaol, guarded by the military, who now\r\nprobably fancied that their night\'s work was over, and that the most\r\nturbulent and troublesome spirits in the town had been secured.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, was not the case, for no sooner had comparative order\r\nbeen restored, than common observation pointed to a dull red glare in\r\nthe southern sky.\r\n\r\nIn a few more minutes there came in stragglers from the open country,\r\nshouting "Fire! fire!" with all their might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE MOB\'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S.--THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN\r\nADMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed towards that southern sky which each moment was\r\nbecoming more and more illuminated by the lurid appearance bespeaking a\r\nconflagration, which if it was not extensive, at all events was raging\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\nThere came, too upon the wind, which set from that direction, strange\r\nsounds, resembling shouts of triumph, combined occasionally with sharper\r\ncries, indicative of alarm.\r\n\r\nWith so much system and so quietly had this attack been made upon the\r\nhouse of Sir Francis Varney--for the consequences of it now exhibited\r\nthemselves most unequivocally--that no one who had not actually\r\naccompanied the expedition was in the least aware that it had been at\r\nall undertaken, or that anything of the kind was on the tapis.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it could be no longer kept a secret, and as the infuriated\r\nmob, who had sought this flagrant means of giving vent to their anger,\r\nsaw the flames from the blazing house rising high in the heavens, they\r\nfelt convinced that further secrecy was out of the question.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in such cries and shouts as--but for caution\'s sake--they\r\nwould have indulged in from the very first, they now gave utterance to\r\ntheir feelings as regarded the man whose destruction was aimed at.\r\n\r\n"Death to the vampyre!--death to the vampyre!" was the principal shout,\r\nand it was uttered in tones which sounded like those of rage and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary, now that we have disposed of the smaller number of\r\nrioters who committed so serious an outrage at the inn, that we should,\r\nwith some degree of method, follow the proceedings of the larger number,\r\nwho went from the town towards Sir Francis Varney\'s.\r\n\r\nThese persons either had information of a very positive nature, or a\r\nvery strong suspicion that, notwithstanding the mysterious and most\r\nunaccountable disappearance of the vampyre in the old ruin, he would now\r\nbe found, as usual, at his own residence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of his own servants may have thus played the traitor to him;\r\nbut however it was, there certainly was an air of confidence about some\r\nof the leaders of the tumultuous assemblage that induced a general\r\nbelief that this time, at least, the vampyre would not escape popular\r\nvengeance for being what he was.\r\n\r\nWe have before noticed that these people went out of the town at\r\ndifferent points, and did not assemble into one mass until they were at\r\na sufficient distance off to be free from all fear of observation.\r\n\r\nThen some of the less observant and cautious of them began to indulge in\r\nshouts of rage and defiance; but those who placed themselves foremost\r\nsucceeded in procuring a halt, and one said,--\r\n\r\n"Good friends all, if we make any noise, it can only have one effect,\r\nand that is, to warn Sir Francis Varney, and enable him to escape. If,\r\ntherefore, we cannot go on quietly, I propose that we return to our\r\nhomes, for we shall accomplish nothing."\r\n\r\nThis advice was sufficiently and evidently reasonable to meet with no\r\ndissension; a death-like stillness ensued, only broken by some two or\r\nthree voices saying, in subdued tones,--\r\n\r\n"That\'s right--that\'s right. Nobody speak."\r\n\r\n"Come on, then," said he who had given such judicious counsel; and the\r\ndark mass of men moved towards Sir Francis Varney\'s house, as quietly as\r\nit was possible for such an assemblage to proceed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, saving the sound of the footsteps, nothing could be heard of\r\nthem at all; and that regular tramp, tramp, would have puzzled any one\r\nlistening to it from any distance to know in which direction it was\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nIn this way they went on until Sir Francis Varney\'s house was reached,\r\nand then a whispered word to halt was given, and all eyes were bent upon\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nFrom but one window out of the numerous ones with which the front of the\r\nmansion was studded did there shine the least light, and from that there\r\ncame rather an uncommonly bright reflection, probably arising from a\r\nreading lamp placed close to the window.\r\n\r\nA general impression, they knew not why exactly, seemed to pervade\r\neverybody, that in the room from whence streamed that bright light was\r\nSir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"The vampyre\'s room!" said several. "The vampyre\'s room! That is it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he who had a kind of moral control over his comrades; "I\r\nhave no doubt but he is there."\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done?" asked several.\r\n\r\n"Make no noise whatever, but stand aside, so as not to be seen from the\r\ndoor when it is opened."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"I will knock for admittance, and, the moment it is answered, I will\r\nplace this stick in such a manner within, that the door cannot be closed\r\nagain. Upon my saying \'Advance,\' you will make a rush forward, and we\r\nshall have possession immediately of the house."\r\n\r\nAll this was agreed to. The mob slunk close to the walls of the house,\r\nand out of immediate observation from the hall door, or from any of the\r\nwindows, and then the leader advanced, and knocked loudly for admission.\r\n\r\nThe silence was now of the most complete character that could be\r\nimagined. Those who came there so bent upon vengeance were thoroughly\r\nconvinced of the necessity of extreme caution, to save themselves even\r\nyet from being completely foiled.\r\n\r\nThey had abundant faith, from experience, of the resources in the way of\r\nescape of Sir Francis Varney, and not one among them was there who\r\nconsidered that there was any chance of capturing him, except by\r\nsurprise, and when once they got hold of him, they determined he should\r\nnot easily slip through their fingers.\r\n\r\nThe knock for admission produced no effect; and, after waiting three or\r\nfour minutes, it was very provoking to find such a wonderful amount of\r\ncaution and cunning completely thrown away.\r\n\r\n"Try again," whispered one.\r\n\r\n"Well, have patience; I am going to try again."\r\n\r\nThe man had the ponderous old-fashioned knocker in his hand, and was\r\nabout to make another appeal to Sir Francis Varney\'s door, when a\r\nstrange voice said,--\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you may as well say at once what you want, instead of knocking\r\nthere to no purpose."\r\n\r\nHe gave a start, for the voice seemed to come from the very door itself.\r\n\r\nYet it sounded decidedly human; and, upon a closer inspection, it was\r\nseen that a little wicket-gate, not larger than a man\'s face, had been\r\nopened from within.\r\n\r\nThis was terribly provoking. Here was an extent of caution on the part\r\nof the garrison quite unexpected. What was to be done?\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the man who appeared at the little opening.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said he who had knocked; "I--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I--that is to say--ahem! Is Sir Francis Varney within?"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I say, is Sir Francis Varney within?"\r\n\r\n"Well; you have said it!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, but you have not answered it."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, is he at home?"\r\n\r\n"I decline saying; so you had better, all of you, go back to the town\r\nagain, for we are well provided with all material to resist any attack\r\nyou may be fools enough to make."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the servant shut the little square door with a bang that\r\nmade his questioner jump again. Here was a dilemma!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK UPON THE VAMPYRE\'S HOUSE.--THE STORY OF THE ATTACK.--THE\r\nFORCING OF THE DOORS, AND THE STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA council of war was now called among the belligerents, who were\r\nsomewhat taken aback by the steady refusal of the servant to admit them,\r\nand their apparent determination to resist all endeavours on the part of\r\nthe mob to get into and obtain possession of the house. It argued that\r\nthey were prepared to resist all attempts, and it would cost some few\r\nlives to get into the vampyre\'s house. This passed through the minds of\r\nmany as they retired behind the angle of the wall where the council was\r\nto be held.\r\n\r\nHere they looked in each others\' face, as if to gather from that the\r\ngeneral tone of the feelings of their companions; but here they saw\r\nnothing that intimated the least idea of going back as they came.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well, mates, to take care of ourselves, you know," began\r\none tall, brawny fellow; "but, if we bean\'t to be sucked to death by a\r\nvampyre, why we must have the life out of him."\r\n\r\n"Ay, so we must."\r\n\r\n"Jack Hodge is right; we must kill him, and there\'s no sin in it, for he\r\nhas no right to it; he\'s robbed some poor fellow of his life to prolong\r\nhis own."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, that\'s the way he does; bring him out, I say, then see what we\r\nwill do with him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, catch him first," said one, "and then we can dispose of him\r\nafterwards, I say, neighbours, don\'t you think it would be as well to\r\ncatch him first?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t we come on purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but do it."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t we trying it?"\r\n\r\n"You will presently, when we come to get into the house."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s to be done?" said one; "here we are in a fix, I think, and\r\nI can\'t see our way out very clearly."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I wish we could get in."\r\n\r\n"But how is a question I don\'t very well see," said a large specimen of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n"The best thing that can be done will be to go round and look over the\r\nwhole house, and then we may come upon some part where it is far easier\r\nto get in at than by the front door."\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t do for us all to go round that way," said one; "a small\r\nparty only should go, else they will have all their people stationed at\r\none point, and if we can divide them, we shall beat them because they\r\nhave not enough to defend more than one point at a time; now we are\r\nnumerous enough to make several attacks."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s the way to bother them all round; they\'ll give in, and then\r\nthe place is our own."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the big countryman, "I like to make a good rush and drive\r\nall afore us; you know what ye have to do then, and you do it, ye know."\r\n\r\n"If you can."\r\n\r\n"Ay, to be sure, if we can, as you say; but can\'t we? that\'s what I want\r\nto know."\r\n\r\n"To be sure we can."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll do it, mate--that\'s my mind; we\'ll do it. Come on, and let\'s\r\nhave another look at the street-door."\r\n\r\nThe big countryman left the main body, and resolutely walked up to the\r\nmain avenue, and approached the door, accompanied by about a dozen or\r\nless of the mob. When they came to the door, they commenced knocking and\r\nkicking most violently, and assailing it with all kinds of things they\r\ncould lay their hands upon.\r\n\r\nThey continued at this violent exercise for some time--perhaps for five\r\nminutes, when the little square hole in the door was again opened, and a\r\nvoice was heard to say,--\r\n\r\n"You had better cease that kind of annoyance."\r\n\r\n"We want to get in."\r\n\r\n"It will cost you more lives to do so than you can afford to spare. We\r\nare well armed, and are prepared to resist any effort you can make."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s all very well; but, an you won\'t open, why we\'ll make you;\r\nthat\'s all about it."\r\n\r\nThis was said as the big countryman and his companions were leaving the\r\navenue towards the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n"Then, take this, as an earnest of what is to follow," said the man, and\r\nhe discharged the contents of a blunderbuss through the small opening,\r\nand its report sounded to the rest of the mob like the report of a\r\nfield-piece.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the party retiring the man couldn\'t take any aim, else\r\nit is questionable how many of the party would have got off unwounded.\r\nAs it was, several of them found stray slugs were lodged in various\r\nparts of their persons, and accelerated their retreat from the house of\r\nthe vampyre.\r\n\r\n"What luck?" inquired one of the mob to the others, as they came back;\r\n"I\'m afraid you had all the honour."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, we have, and all the lead too," replied a man, as he placed his\r\nhand upon a sore part of his person, which bled in consequence of a\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Danged if I know," said one.\r\n\r\n"Give it up," said another.\r\n\r\n"No, no; have him out. I\'ll never give in while I can use a stick. They\r\nare in earnest, and so are we. Don\'t let us be frightened because they\r\nhave a gun or two--they can\'t have many; and besides, if they have, we\r\nare too many for them. Besides, we shall all die in our beds."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! down with the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"So say I, lads. I don\'t want to be sucked to death when I\'m a-bed.\r\nBetter die like a man than such a dog\'s death as that, and you have no\r\nrevenge then."\r\n\r\n"No, no; he has the better of us then. We\'ll have him out--we\'ll burn\r\nhim--that\'s the way we\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, so we will; only let us get in."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a chosen party returned who had been round the house to\r\nmake a reconnaissance.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," inquired the mob, "what can be done now--where can we get\r\nin?"\r\n\r\n"In several places."\r\n\r\n"All right; come along then; the place is our own."\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute; they are armed at all points, and we must make an attack\r\non all points, else we may fail. A party must go round to the\r\nfront-door, and attempt to beat it in; there are plenty of poles and\r\nthings that could be used for such a purpose."\r\n\r\n"There is, besides, a garden-door, that opens into the house--a kind of\r\nparlour; a kitchen-door; a window in the flower-garden, and an entrance\r\ninto a store-room; this place appears strong, and is therefore\r\nunguarded."\r\n\r\n"The very point to make an attack."\r\n\r\n"Not quite."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because it can easily be defended, and rendered useless to us. We must\r\nmake an attack upon all places but that, and, while they are being at\r\nthose points, we can then enter at that place, and then you will find\r\nthem desert the other places when they see us inside."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! down with the vampyre!" said the mob, as they listened to this\r\nadvice, and appreciated the plan.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Now, then, lads, divide, and make the attack; never mind their guns,\r\nthey have but very few, and if you rush in upon them, you will soon have\r\nthe guns yourselves."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the mob.\r\n\r\nThe mob now moved away in different bodies, each strong enough to carry\r\nthe house. They seized upon a variety of poles and stones, and then made\r\nfor the various doors and windows that were pointed out by those who had\r\nmade the discovery. Each one of those who had formed the party of\r\nobservation, formed a leader to the others, and at once proceeded to the\r\npost assigned him.\r\n\r\nThe attack was so sudden and so simultaneous that the servants were\r\nunprepared; and though they ran to the doors, and fired away, still they\r\ndid but little good, for the doors were soon forced open by the enraged\r\nrioters, who proceeded in a much more systematic operation, using long\r\nheavy pieces of timber which were carried on the shoulders of several\r\nmen, and driven with the force of battering-rams--which, in fact, they\r\nwere--against the door.\r\n\r\nBang went the battering-ram, crash went the door, and the whole party\r\nrushed headlong in, carried forward by their own momentum and fell\r\nprostrate, engine and all, into the passage.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, we have them," exclaimed the servants, who began to belabour\r\nthe whole party with blows, with every weapon they could secure.\r\n\r\nLoudly did the fallen men shout for assistance, and but for their\r\nfellows who came rushing in behind, they would have had but a sorry time\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob; "the house is our own."\r\n\r\n"Not yet," shouted the servants.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll try," said the mob; and they rushed forward to drive the servants\r\nback, but they met with a stout resistance, and as some of them had\r\nchoppers and swords, there were a few wounds given, and presently bang\r\nwent the blunderbuss.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the mob reeled and fell.\r\n\r\nThis produced a momentary panic, and the servants then had the whole of\r\nthe victory to themselves, and were about to charge, and clear the\r\npassage of their enemies, when a shout behind attracted their attention.\r\n\r\nThat shout was caused by an entrance being gained in another quarter,\r\nwhence the servants were flying, and all was disorder.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the mob.\r\n\r\nThe servants retreated to the stairs, and here united, they made a\r\nstand, and resolved to resist the whole force of the rioters, and they\r\nsucceeded in doing so, too, for some minutes. Blows were given and taken\r\nof a desperate character.\r\n\r\nSomehow, there were no deadly blows received by the servants; they were\r\nbeing forced and beaten, but they lost no life; this may be accounted\r\nfor by the fact that the mob used no more deadly weapons than sticks.\r\n\r\nThe servants of Sir Francis Varney, on the contrary, were mostly armed\r\nwith deadly weapons, which, however, they did not use unnecessarily.\r\nThey stood upon the hall steps--the grand staircase, with long poles or\r\nsticks, about the size of quarter-staves, and with these they belaboured\r\nthose below most unmercifully.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the mob were by no means cowards, for the struggle to close\r\nwith their enemies was as great as ever, and as firm as could well be.\r\nIndeed, they rushed on with a desperation truly characteristic of John\r\nBull, and defied the heaviest blows; for as fast as one was stricken\r\ndown another occupied his place, and they insensibly pressed their close\r\nand compact front upon the servants, who were becoming fatigued and\r\nharassed.\r\n\r\n"Fire, again," exclaimed a voice from among the servants.\r\n\r\nThe mob made no retrogade movement, but still continued to press\r\nonwards, and in another moment a loud report rang through the house, and\r\na smoke hung over the heads of the mob.\r\n\r\nA long groan or two escaped some of the men who had been wounded, and a\r\nstill louder from those who had not been wounded, and a cry arose of,--\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre--pull down--destroy and burn the whole\r\nplace--down with them all."\r\n\r\nA rush succeeded, and a few more discharges took place, when a shout\r\nabove attracted the attention of both parties engaged in this fierce\r\nstruggle. They paused by mutual consent, to look and see what was the\r\ncause of that shout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE MOB AND SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.--THE MYSTERIOUS\r\nDISAPPEARANCE.--THE WINE CELLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe shout that had so discomposed the parties who were thus engaged in a\r\nterrific struggle came from a party above.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! hurrah!" they shouted a number of times, in a wild strain of\r\ndelight. "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"\r\n\r\nThe fact was, a party of the mob had clambered up a verandah, and\r\nentered some of the rooms upstairs, whence they emerged just above the\r\nlanding near the spot where the servants were resisting in a mass the\r\nefforts of the mob.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob below.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob above.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause, and the servants divided themselves into\r\ntwo bodies, and one turned to face those above, and the other those who\r\nwere below.\r\n\r\nA simultaneous shout was given by both parties of the mob, and a sudden\r\nrush was made by both bodies, and the servants of Sir Francis Varney\r\nwere broken in an instant. They were instantly separated, and knocked\r\nabout a good bit, but they were left to shift for themselves, the mob\r\nhad a more important object in view.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" they shouted.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" shouted they, and they rushed helter skelter\r\nthrough the rooms, until they came to one where the door was partially\r\nopen, and they could see some person very leisurely seated.\r\n\r\n"Here he is," they cried.\r\n\r\n"Who? who?"\r\n\r\n"The vampire."\r\n\r\n"Down with him! kill him! burn him!"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! down with the vampire!"\r\n\r\nThese sounds were shouted out by a score of voices, and they rushed\r\nheadlong into the room.\r\n\r\nBut here their violence and headlong precipitancy were suddenly\r\nrestrained by the imposing and quiet appearance of the individual who\r\nwas there seated.\r\n\r\nThe mob entered the room, and there was a sight, that if it did not\r\nastonish them, at least, it caused them to pause before the individual\r\nwho was seated there.\r\n\r\nThe room was well filled with furniture, and there was a curtain drawn\r\nacross the room, and about the middle of it there was a table, behind\r\nwhich sat Sir Francis Varney himself, looking all smiles and courtesy.\r\n\r\n"Well, dang my smock-frock!" said one, "who\'d ha\' thought of this? He\r\ndon\'t seem to care much about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m d----d!" said another; "he seems pretty easy, at all events.\r\nWhat is he going to do?"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Sir Francis Varney, rising, with the blandest smiles,\r\n"pray, gentlemen, permit me to inquire the cause of this condescension\r\non your part. The visit is kind."\r\n\r\nThe mob looked at Sir Francis, and then at each other, and then at Sir\r\nFrancis again; but nobody spoke. They were awed by this gentlemanly and\r\ncollected behaviour.\r\n\r\n"If you honour me with this visit from pure affection and neighbourly\r\ngood-will, I thank you."\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" said one, who was concealed behind the rest,\r\nand not so much overawed, as he had not seen Sir Francis.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney rose to his full height; a light gleamed across his\r\nfeatures; they were strongly defined then. His long front teeth, too,\r\nshowed most strongly when he smiled, as he did now, and said, in a bland\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I am at your service. Permit me to say you are welcome to\r\nall I can do for you. I fear the interview will be somewhat inconvenient\r\nand unpleasant to you. As for myself, I am entirely at your service."\r\n\r\nAs Sir Francis spoke, he bowed, and folded his hands together, and\r\nstepped forwards; but, instead of coming onwards to them, he walked\r\nbehind the curtain, and was immediately hid from their view.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" shouted one.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" rang through the apartment; and the mob now,\r\nnot awed by the coolness and courtesy of Sir Francis, rushed forward,\r\nand, overturning the table, tore down the curtain to the floor; but, to\r\ntheir amazement, there was no Sir Francis Varney present.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Where is the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"Where has he gone?"\r\n\r\nThese were cries that escaped every one\'s lips; and yet no one could\r\ngive an answer to them.\r\n\r\nThere Sir Francis Varney was not. They were completely thunderstricken.\r\nThey could not find out where he had gone to. There was no possible\r\nmeans of escape, that they could perceive. There was not an odd corner,\r\nor even anything that could, by any possibility, give even a suspicion\r\nthat even a temporary concealment could take place.\r\n\r\nThey looked over every inch of flooring and of wainscoting; not the\r\nremotest trace could be discovered.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said one--"I can\'t see where he could have gone. There\r\nain\'t a hole as big as a keyhole."\r\n\r\n"My eye!" said one; "I shouldn\'t be at all surprised, if he were to blow\r\nup the whole house."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say go!"\r\n\r\n"I never heard as how vampyres could do so much as that. They ain\'t the\r\nsort of people," said another.\r\n\r\n"But if they can do one thing, they can do another."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very true."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s more, I never heard as how a vampyre could make himself into\r\nnothing before; yet he has done so."\r\n\r\n"He may be in this room now."\r\n\r\n"He may."\r\n\r\n"My eyes! what precious long teeth he had!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and had he fixed one on \'em in to your arm, he would have drawn\r\nevery drop of blood out of your body; you may depend upon that," said an\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n"He was very tall."\r\n\r\n"Yes; too tall to be any good."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t like him to have laid hold of me, though, tall as he is;\r\nand then he would have lifted me up high enough to break my neck, when\r\nhe let me fall."\r\n\r\nThe mob routed about the room, tore everything out of its place, and as\r\nthe object of their search seemed to be far enough beyond their reach,\r\ntheir courage rose in proportion, and they shouted and screamed with a\r\nproportionate increase of noise and bustle; and at length they ran about\r\nmad with rage and vexation, doing all the mischief that was in their\r\npower to inflict.\r\n\r\nThen they became mischievous, and tore the furniture from its place, and\r\nbroke it in pieces, and then amused themselves with breaking it up,\r\nthrowing pieces at the pier-glasses, in which they made dreadful holes;\r\nand when that was gone, they broke up the frames.\r\n\r\nEvery hole and corner of the house was searched, but there was no Sir\r\nFrancis Varney to be found.\r\n\r\n"The cellars, the cellars!" shouted a voice.\r\n\r\n"The cellars, the cellars!" re-echoed nearly every pair of lips in the\r\nwhole place; in another moment, there was crushing and crowding to get\r\ndown into the cellars.\r\n\r\n"Hurray!" said one, as he knocked off the neck of the bottle that first\r\ncame to hand.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s luck to vampyre-hunting! Success to our chase!"\r\n\r\n"So say I, neighbour; but is that your manners to drink before your\r\nbetters?"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the speaker knocked the other\'s elbow, while he was in the\r\nact of lifting the wine to his mouth; and thus he upset it over his face\r\nand eyes.\r\n\r\n"D--n it!" cried the man; "how it makes my eyes smart! Dang thee! if I\r\ncould see, I\'d ring thy neck!"\r\n\r\n"Success to vampyre-hunting!" said one.\r\n\r\n"May we be lucky yet!" said another.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be luckier than this," said another, as he, too, emptied a\r\nbottle. "We couldn\'t desire better entertainment, where the reckoning is\r\nall paid."\r\n\r\n"Excellent!"\r\n\r\n"Very good!"\r\n\r\n"Capital wine this!"\r\n\r\n"I say, Huggins!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Huggins.\r\n\r\n"What are you drinking?"\r\n\r\n"Wine."\r\n\r\n"What wine?"\r\n\r\n"Danged if I know," was the reply. "It\'s wine, I suppose; for I know it\r\nain\'t beer nor spirits; so it must be wine."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it ain\'t bottled men\'s blood?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\n"Bottled blood, man! Who knows what a vampyre drinks? It may be his\r\nwine. He may feast upon that before he goes to bed of a night, drink\r\nanybody\'s health, and make himself cheerful on bottled blood!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, danged! I\'m so sick; I wish I hadn\'t taken the stuff. It may be as\r\nyou say, neighbour, and then we be cannibals."\r\n\r\n"Or vampyres."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a pretty thing to think of."\r\n\r\nBy this time some were drunk, some were partially so, and the remainder\r\nwere crowding into the cellars to get their share of the wine.\r\n\r\nThe servants had now slunk away; they were no longer noticed by the\r\nrioters, who, having nobody to oppose them, no longer thought of\r\nanything, save the searching after the vampyre, and the destruction of\r\nthe property. Several hours had been spent in this manner, and yet they\r\ncould not find the object of their search.\r\n\r\nThere was not a room, or cupboard, or a cellar, that was capable of\r\ncontaining a cat, that they did not search, besides a part of the\r\nrioters keeping a very strict watch on the outside of the house and all\r\nabout the grounds, to prevent the possibility of the escape of the\r\nvampyre.\r\n\r\nThere was a general cessation of active hostilities at that moment; a\r\nreaction after the violent excitement and exertion they had made to get\r\nin. Then the escape of their victim, and the mysterious manner in which\r\nhe got away, was also a cause of the reaction, and the rioters looked in\r\neach others\' countenances inquiringly.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the discovery of the wine-cellar tended to withdraw them from\r\nviolent measures; but this could not last long, there must be an end to\r\nsuch a scene, for there never was a large body of men assembled for an\r\nevil purpose, who ever were, for any length of time, peaceable.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the more alarming effects of drunkenness, some few of the\r\nrioters, after having taken some small portion of the wine, became, from\r\nthe peculiar flavour it possessed, imbued with the idea that it was\r\nreally blood, and forthwith commenced an instant attack upon the wine\r\nand liquors, and they were soon mingling in one stream throughout the\r\ncellars.\r\n\r\nThis destruction was loudly declaimed against by a large portion of the\r\nrioters, who were drinking; but before they could make any efforts to\r\nsave the liquor, the work of destruction had not only been begun, but\r\nwas ended, and the consequence was, the cellars were very soon evacuated\r\nby the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S HOUSE BY FIRE.--THE ARRIVAL OF\r\nTHE MILITARY, AND A SECOND MOB.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus many moments had not elapsed ere the feelings of the rioters became\r\ndirected into a different channel from that in which it had so lately\r\nflowed. When urged about the house and grounds for the vampyre, they\r\nbecame impatient and angry at not finding him. Many believed that he was\r\nyet about the house, while many were of opinion that he had flown away\r\nby some mysterious means only possessed by vampyres and such like\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n"Fire the house, and burn him out," said one.\r\n\r\n"Fire the house!"\r\n\r\n"Burn the den!" now arose in shouts from all present, and then the mob\r\nwere again animated by the love of mischief that seemed to be the\r\nstrongest feelings that animated them.\r\n\r\n"Burn him out--burn him out!" were the only words that could be heard\r\nfrom any of the mob. The words ran through the house like wildfire,\r\nnobody thought of anything else, and all were seen running about in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of good will on the part of the mob to the\r\nundertaking; far from it, and they proceeded in the work _con amore_.\r\nThey worked together with right good will, and the result was soon seen\r\nby the heaps of combustible materials that were collected in a short\r\ntime from all parts of the house.\r\n\r\nAll the old dry wood furniture that could be found was piled up in a\r\nheap, and to these were added a number of faggots, and also some\r\nshavings that were found in the cellar.\r\n\r\n"All right!" exclaimed one man, in exultation.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied a second; "all right--all right! Set light to it, and he\r\nwill be smoked out if not burned."\r\n\r\n"Let us be sure that all are out of the house," suggested one of the\r\nbystanders.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," shouted several; "give them all a chance. Search through the\r\nhouse and give them a warning."\r\n\r\n"Very well; give me the light, and then when I come back I will set\r\nlight to the fire at once, and then I shall know all is empty, and so\r\nwill you too."\r\n\r\nThis was at once agreed to by all, with acclamations, and the light\r\nbeing handed to the man, he ascended the stairs, crying out in a loud\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n"Come out--come out! the house is on fire!"\r\n\r\n"Fire! fire! fire!" shouted the mob as a chorus, every now and then at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes more, there came a cry of "all right; the house is\r\nempty," from up the stairs, and the man descended in haste to the hall.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, lads, and fire away, for I see the red coats are leaving\r\nthe town."\r\n\r\n"Hurra! hurra!" shouted the infuriated mob. "Fire--fire--fire the house!\r\nBurn out the vampyre! Burn down the house--burn him out, and see if he\r\ncan stand fire."\r\n\r\nAmidst all this tumult there came a sudden blaze upon all around, for\r\nthe pile had been fired.\r\n\r\n"Hurra!" shouted the mob--"hurra!" and they danced like maniacs round\r\nthe fire; looking, in fact, like so many wild Indians, dancing round\r\ntheir roasting victims, or some demons at an infernal feast.\r\n\r\nThe torch had been put to twenty different places, and the flames united\r\ninto one, and suddenly shot up with a velocity, and roared with a sound\r\nthat caused many who were present to make a precipitate retreat from the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nThis soon became a necessary measure of self-preservation, and it\r\nrequired no urging to induce them to quit a place that was burning\r\nrapidly and even furiously.\r\n\r\n"Get the poles and firewood--get faggots," shouted some of the mob, and,\r\nlo, it was done almost by magic. They brought the faggots and wood piled\r\nup for winter use, and laid them near all the doors, and especially the\r\nmain entrance. Nay, every gate or door belonging to the outhouses was\r\nbrought forward and placed upon the fire, which now began to reach the\r\nupper stories.\r\n\r\n"Hurra--fire! Hurra--fire!"\r\n\r\nAnd a loud shout of triumph came from the mob as they viewed the\r\nprogress of the flames, as they came roaring and tearing through the\r\nhouse doors and the windows.\r\n\r\nEach new victory of the element was a signal to the mob for a cheer; and\r\na hearty cheer, too, came from them.\r\n\r\n"Where is the vampyre now?" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n"Ha! where is he?" said another.\r\n\r\n"If he be there," said the man, pointing to the flames, "I reckon he\'s\r\ngot a warm berth of it, and, at the same time, very little water to boil\r\nin his kettle."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! what a funny old man is Bob Mason; he\'s always poking fun; he\'d\r\njoke if his wife were dying."\r\n\r\n"There is many a true word spoken in jest," suggested another; "and, to\r\nmy mind, Bob Mason wouldn\'t be very much grieved if his wife were to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Die?" said Bob; "she and I have lived and quarrelled daily a matter of\r\nfive-and-thirty years, and, if that ain\'t enough to make a man sick of\r\nbeing married, and of his wife, hand me, that\'s all. I say I am tired."\r\n\r\nThis was said with much apparent sincerity, and several laughed at the\r\nold man\'s heartiness.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well," said the old man; "it\'s all very well to laugh\r\nabout matters you don\'t understand, but I know it isn\'t a joke--not a\r\nbit on it. I tells you what it is, neighbour, I never made but one grand\r\nmistake in all my life."\r\n\r\n"And what was that?"\r\n\r\n"To tie myself to a woman."\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'d get married to-morrow if your wife were to die to-day," said\r\none.\r\n\r\n"If I did, I hope I may marry a vampyre. I should have something then to\r\nthink about. I should know what\'s o\'clock. But, as for my old woman,\r\nlord, lord, I wish Sir Francis Varney had had her for life. I\'ll warrant\r\nwhen the next natural term of his existence came round again, he\r\nwouldn\'t be in no hurry to renew it; if he did, I should say that\r\nvampyres had the happy lot of managing women, which I haven\'t got."\r\n\r\n"No, nor anybody else."\r\n\r\nA loud shout now attracted their attention, and, upon looking in the\r\nquarter whence it came, they descried a large body of people coming\r\ntowards them; from one end of the mob could be seen a long string of red\r\ncoats.\r\n\r\n"The red coats!" shouted one.\r\n\r\n"The military!" shouted another.\r\n\r\nIt was plain the military who had been placed in the town to quell\r\ndisturbances, had been made acquainted with the proceedings at Sir\r\nFrancis Varney\'s house, and were now marching to relieve the place, and\r\nto save the property.\r\n\r\nThey were, as we have stated, accompanied by a vast concourse of people,\r\nwho came out to see what they were going to see, and seeing the flames\r\nat Sir Francis Varney\'s house, they determined to come all the way, and\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\nThe military, seeing the disturbance in the distance, and the flames\r\nissuing from the windows, made the best of their way towards the scene\r\nof tumult with what speed they could make.\r\n\r\n"Here they come," said one.\r\n\r\n"Yes, just in time to see what is done."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they can go back and say we have burned the vampyre\'s house\r\ndown--hurra!"\r\n\r\n"Hurra!" shouted the mob, in prolonged accents, and it reached the ears\r\nof the military.\r\n\r\nThe officer urged the men onwards, and they responded to his words, by\r\nexerting themselves to step out a little faster.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they should have been here before this; it\'s no use, now, they are\r\ntoo late."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are too late."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if the vampyre can breathe through the smoke, and live in\r\nfire," said one.\r\n\r\n"I should think he must be able to do so, if he can stand shooting, as\r\nwe know he can--you can\'t kill a vampyre; but yet he must be consumed,\r\nif the fire actually touches him, but not unless he can bear almost\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"So he can."\r\n\r\n"Hurra!" shouted the mob, as a tall flame shot through the top windows\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nThe fire had got the ascendant now, and no hopes could be entertained,\r\nhowever extravagant, of saving the smallest article that had been left\r\nin the mansion.\r\n\r\n"Hurra!" shouted the mob with the military, who came up with them.\r\n\r\n"Hurra!" shouted the others in reply.\r\n\r\n"Quick march!" said the officer; and then, in a loud, commanding tone,\r\nhe shouted, "Clear the way, there! clear the way."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s room enough for you," said old Mason; "what are you making\r\nso much noise about?"\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at the officer, who took no notice of the\r\nwords, but ordered his men up before the burning pile, which was now an\r\nimmense mass of flame.\r\n\r\nThe mob who had accompanied the military now mingled with the mob that\r\nhad set the house of Sir Francis Varney on fire ere the military had\r\ncome up with them.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" cried out the officer; and the men, obedient to the word of\r\ncommand, halted, and drew up in a double line before the house.\r\n\r\nThere were then some words of command issued, and some more given to\r\nsome of the subalterns, and a party of men, under the command of a\r\nsergeant, was sent off from the main body, to make a circuit of the\r\nhouse and grounds.\r\n\r\nThe officer gazed for some moments upon the burning pile without\r\nspeaking; and then, turning to the next in command, he said in low\r\ntones, as he looked upon the mob,--\r\n\r\n"We have come too late."\r\n\r\n"Yes, much."\r\n\r\n"The house is now nearly gutted."\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"And those who came crowding along with us are inextricably mingled with\r\nthe others who have been the cause of all this mischief: there\'s no\r\ndistinguishing them one from another."\r\n\r\n"And if you did, you could not say who had done it, and who had not; you\r\ncould prove nothing."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"I shall not attempt to take prisoners, unless any act is perpetrated\r\nbeyond what has been done."\r\n\r\n"It is a singular affair."\r\n\r\n"Very."\r\n\r\n"This Sir Francis Varney is represented to be a courteous, gentlemanly\r\nman," said the officer.\r\n\r\n"No doubt about it, but he\'s beset by a parcel of people who do not mind\r\ncutting a throat if they can get an opportunity of doing so."\r\n\r\n"And I expect they will."\r\n\r\n"Yes, when there is a popular excitement against any man, he had better\r\nleave this part at once and altogether. It is dangerous to tamper with\r\npopular prejudices; no man who has any value for his life ought to do\r\nso. It is a sheer act of suicide."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF VARNEY\'S HOUSE.--A NIGHT SCENE.--POPULAR SUPERSTITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe officer ceased to speak, and then the party whom he had sent round\r\nthe house and grounds returned, and gained the main body orderly enough,\r\nand the sergeant went forward to make his report to his superior\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual salutation, he waited for the inquiry to be put to him\r\nas to what he had seen.\r\n\r\n"Well, Scott, what have you done?"\r\n\r\n"I went round the premises, sir, according to your instructions, but saw\r\nno one either in the vicinity of the house, or in the grounds around\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No strangers, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, none."\r\n\r\n"You saw nothing at all likely to lead to any knowledge as to who it was\r\nthat has caused this catastrophe?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Have you learnt anything among the people who are the perpetrators of\r\nthis fire?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that will do, unless there is anything else that you can\r\nthink of."\r\n\r\n"Nothing further, sir, unless it is that I heard some of them say that\r\nSir Francis Varney has perished in the flames."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!"\r\n\r\n"So I heard, sir."\r\n\r\n"That must be impossible, and yet why should it be so? Go back, Scott,\r\nand bring me some person who can give me some information upon this\r\npoint."\r\n\r\nThe sergeant departed toward the people, who looked at him without any\r\ndistrust, for he came single-handed, though they thought he came with\r\nthe intention of learning what they knew of each other, and so stroll\r\nabout with the intention of getting up accusations against them. But\r\nthis was not the case, the officer didn\'t like the work well enough;\r\nhe\'d rather have been elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt length the sergeant came to one man, whom he accosted, and said to\r\nhim,--\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything of yonder fire?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: I do know it is a fire."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so do I."\r\n\r\n"My friend," said the sergeant, "when a soldier asks a question he does\r\nnot expect an uncivil answer."\r\n\r\n"But a soldier may ask a question that may have an uncivil end to it."\r\n\r\n"He may; but it is easy to say so."\r\n\r\n"I do say so, then, now."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll not trouble you any more."\r\n\r\nThe sergeant moved on a pace or two more, and then, turning to the mob,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"Is there any one among you who can tell me anything concerning the fate\r\nof Sir Francis Varney?"\r\n\r\n"Burnt!"\r\n\r\n"Did you see him burnt?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I saw him."\r\n\r\n"In the flames?"\r\n\r\n"No; before the house was on fire."\r\n\r\n"In the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and he has not been seen to leave it since, and we conclude he\r\nmust have been burned."\r\n\r\n"Will you come and say as much to my commanding officer? It is all I\r\nwant."\r\n\r\n"Shall I be detained?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then I will go," said the man, and he hobbled out of the crowd towards\r\nthe sergeant. "I will go and see the officer, and tell him what I know,\r\nand that is very little, and can prejudice no one."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" said the crowd, when they heard this latter assertion; for, at\r\nfirst, they began to be in some alarm lest there should be something\r\nwrong about this, and some of them get identified as being active in the\r\nfray.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant led the man back to the spot, where the officer stood a\r\nlittle way in advance of his men.\r\n\r\n"Well, Scott," he said, "what have we here?"\r\n\r\n"A man who has volunteered a statement, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Well, my man, can you say anything concerning all this disturbance\r\nthat we have here?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then what did you come here for?"\r\n\r\n"I understood the sergeant to want some one who could speak of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I saw him."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"In the house."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; but have you not seen him out of it?"\r\n\r\n"Not since; nor any one else, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Where was he?"\r\n\r\n"Upstairs, where he suddenly disappeared, and nobody can tell where he\r\nmay have gone to. But he has not been seen out of the house since, and\r\nthey say he could not have gone bodily out if they had not seen him."\r\n\r\n"He must have been burnt," said the officer, musingly; "he could not\r\nescape, one would imagine, without being seen by some one out of such a\r\nmob."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no, for I am told they placed a watch at every hole, window,\r\nor door however high, and they saw nothing of him--not even fly out!"\r\n\r\n"Fly out! I\'m speaking of a man!"\r\n\r\n"And I of a vampire!" said the man carelessly.\r\n\r\n"A vampyre! Pooh, pooh!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! Sir Francis Varney is a vampyre! There can be no sort of doubt\r\nabout it. You have only to look at him, and you will soon be satisfied\r\nof that. See his great sharp teeth in front, and ask yourself what they\r\nare for, and you will soon find the answer. They are to make holes with\r\nin the bodies of his victims, through which he can suck their blood!"\r\n\r\nThe officer looked at the man in astonishment for a few moments, as if\r\nhe doubted his own ears, and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"Are you serious?"\r\n\r\n"I am ready to swear to it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have heard a great deal about popular superstition, and thought\r\nI had seen something of it; but this is decidedly the worst case that\r\never I saw or heard of. You had better go home, my man, than, by your\r\npresence, countenance such a gross absurdity."\r\n\r\n"For all that," said the man, "Sir Francis Varney is a vampyre--a\r\nblood-sucker--a human blood-sucker!"\r\n\r\n"Get away with you," said the officer, "and do not repeat such folly\r\nbefore any one."\r\n\r\nThe man almost jumped when he heard the tone in which this was spoken,\r\nfor the officer was both angry and contemptuous, when he heard the words\r\nof the man.\r\n\r\n"These people," he added, turning to the sergeant, "are ignorant in the\r\nextreme. One would think we had got into the country of vampires,\r\ninstead of a civilised community."\r\n\r\nThe day was going down now; the last rays of the setting sun glimmered\r\nupwards, and still shone upon the tree-tops. The darkness of night was\r\nstill fast closing around them. The mob stood a motley mass of human\r\nbeings, wedged together, dark and sombre, gazing upon the mischief that\r\nhad been done--the work of their hands. The military stood at ease\r\nbefore the burning pile, and by their order and regularity, presented a\r\ncontrast to the mob, as strongly by their bright gleaming arms, as by\r\ntheir dress and order.\r\n\r\nThe flames now enveloped the whole mansion. There was not a window or a\r\ndoor from which the fiery element did not burst forth in clouds, and\r\nforked flames came rushing forth with a velocity truly wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe red glare of the flames fell upon all objects around for some\r\ndistance--the more especially so, as the sun had sunk, and a bank of\r\nclouds rose from beneath the horizon and excluded all his rays; there\r\nwas no twilight, and there was, as yet, no moon.\r\n\r\nThe country side was enveloped in darkness, and the burning house could\r\nbe seen for miles around, and formed a rallying-point to all men\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe engines that were within reach came tearing across the country, and\r\ncame to the fire; but they were of no avail. There was no supply of\r\nwater, save from the ornamental ponds. These they could only get at by\r\nmeans that were tedious and unsatisfactory, considering the emergency of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThe house was a lone one, and it was being entirely consumed before they\r\narrived, and therefore there was not the remotest chance of saving the\r\nleast article. Had they ever such a supply of water, nothing could have\r\nbeen effected by it.\r\n\r\nThus the men stood idly by, passing their remarks upon the fire and the\r\nmob.\r\n\r\nThose who stood around, and within the influence of the red glare of the\r\nflames, looked like so many demons in the infernal regions, watching the\r\nprogress of lighting the fire, which we are told by good Christians is\r\nthe doom of the unfortunate in spirit, and the woefully unlucky in\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight that; and there were many persons who would,\r\nwithout doubt, have rather been snug by their own fire-side than they\r\nwould have remained there but it happened that no one felt inclined to\r\nexpress his inclination to his neighbour, and, consequently, no one said\r\nanything on the subject.\r\n\r\nNone would venture to go alone across the fields, where the spirit of\r\nthe vampyre might, for all they knew to the contrary, be waiting to\r\npounce upon them, and worry them.\r\n\r\nNo, no; no man would have quitted that mob to go back alone to the\r\nvillage; they would sooner have stood there all night through. That was\r\nan alternative that none of the number would very willingly accept.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed away, and the house that had been that morning a noble\r\nand well-furnished mansion, was now a smouldering heap of ruins. The\r\nflames had become somewhat subdued, and there was now more smoke than\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nThe fire had exhausted itself. There was now no more material that could\r\nserve it for fuel, and the flames began to become gradually enough\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a rush, and then a bright flame shot upward for an\r\ninstant, so bright and so strong, that it threw a flash of light over\r\nthe country for miles; but it was only momentary, and it subsided.\r\n\r\nThe roof, which had been built strong enough to resist almost anything,\r\nafter being burning for a considerable time, suddenly gave way, and came\r\nin with a tremendous crash, and then all was for a moment darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter this the fire might be said to be subdued, it having burned itself\r\nout; and the flames that could now be seen were but the result of so\r\nmuch charred wood, that would probably smoulder away for a day or two,\r\nif left to itself to do so. A dense mass of smoke arose from the ruins,\r\nand blackened the atmosphere around, and told the spectators the work\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE MOB AND MILITARY TO THE TOWN.--THE MADNESS OF THE\r\nMOB.--THE GROCER\'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the termination of the conflagration, or, rather, the fall of the\r\nroof, with the loss of grandeur in the spectacle, men\'s minds began to\r\nbe free from the excitement that chained them to the spot, watching the\r\nprogress of that element which has been truly described as a very good\r\nservant, but a very bad master; and of the truth of this every one must\r\nbe well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere was now remaining little more than the livid glare of the hot and\r\nburning embers; and this did not extend far, for the walls were too\r\nstrongly built to fall in from their own weight; they were strong and\r\nstout, and intercepted the little light the ashes would have given out.\r\n\r\nThe mob now began to feel fatigued and chilly. It had been standing and\r\nwalking about many hours, and the approach of exhaustion could not be\r\nput off much longer, especially as there was no longer any great\r\nexcitement to carry it off.\r\n\r\nThe officer, seeing that nothing was to be done, collected his men\r\ntogether, and they were soon seen in motion. He had been ordered to stop\r\nany tumult that he might have seen, and to save any property. But there\r\nwas nothing to do now; all the property that could have been saved was\r\nnow destroyed, and the mob were beginning to disperse, and creep towards\r\ntheir own houses.\r\n\r\nThe order was then given for the men to take close order, and keep\r\ntogether, and the word to march was given, which the men obeyed with\r\nalacrity, for they had no good-will in stopping there the whole of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe return to the village of both the mob and the military was not\r\nwithout its vicissitudes; accidents of all kinds were rife amongst them;\r\nthe military, however, taking the open paths, soon diminished the\r\ndistance, and that, too, with little or no accidents, save such as might\r\nhave been expected from the state of the fields, after they had been so\r\nmuch trodden down of late.\r\n\r\nNot so the townspeople or the peasantry; for, by way of keeping up their\r\nspirits, and amusing themselves on their way home, they commenced\r\nlarking, as they called it, which often meant the execution of practical\r\njokes, and these sometimes were of a serious nature.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark at that hour, especially so when there was a number\r\nof persons traversing about, so that little or nothing could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe mistakes and blunders that were made were numerous. In one place\r\nthere were a number of people penetrating a path that led only to a\r\nhedge and deep ditch; indeed it was a brook very deep and muddy.\r\n\r\nHere they came to a stop and endeavoured to ascertain its width, but the\r\nlittle reflected light they had was deceptive, and it did not appear so\r\nbroad as it was.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can jump it," exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n"And so can I," said another. "I have done so before, and why should I\r\nnot do so now."\r\n\r\nThis was unanswerable, and as there were many present, at least a dozen\r\nwere eager to jump.\r\n\r\n"If thee can do it, I know I can," said a brawny countryman; "so I\'ll do\r\nit at once.\r\n\r\n"The sooner the better," shouted some one behind, "or you\'ll have no\r\nroom for a run, here\'s a lot of \'em coming up; push over as quickly as\r\nyou can."\r\n\r\nThus urged, the jumpers at once made a rush to the edge of the ditch,\r\nand many jumped, and many more, from the prevailing darkness, did not\r\nsee exactly where the ditch was, and taking one or two steps too many,\r\nfound themselves up above the waist in muddy water.\r\n\r\nNor were those who jumped much better off, for nearly all jumped short\r\nor fell backwards into the stream, and were dragged out in a terrible\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, lord! oh, lord!" exclaimed one poor fellow, dripping wet and\r\nshivering with cold, "I shall die! oh, the rheumatiz, there\'ll be a\r\npretty winter for me: I\'m half dead."\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise," said another, "and help me to get the mud out of my\r\neye; I can\'t see."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," added a third, "considering how you jump, I don\'t think\r\nyou want to see."\r\n\r\n"This comes a hunting vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s all a judgment; who knows but he may be in the air: it is\r\nnothing to laugh at as I shouldn\'t be surprised if he were: only think\r\nhow precious pleasant."\r\n\r\n"However pleasant it may be to you," remarked one, "it\'s profitable to a\r\ngood many."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Why, see the numbers, of things that will be spoiled, coats torn, hats\r\ncrushed, heads broken, and shoes burst. Oh, it\'s an ill-wind that blows\r\nnobody any good."\r\n\r\n"So it is, but you may benefit anybody you like, so you don\'t do it at\r\nmy expence."\r\n\r\nIn one part of a field where there were some stiles and gates, a big\r\ncountryman caught a fat shopkeeper with the arms of the stile a terrible\r\npoke in the stomach; while the breath was knocked out of the poor man\'s\r\nstomach, and he was gasping with agony, the fellow set to laughing, and\r\nsaid to his companions, who were of the same class--\r\n\r\n"I say, Jim, look at the grocer, he hasn\'t got any wind to spare, I\'d\r\nrun him for a wager, see how he gapes like a fish out of water."\r\n\r\nThe poor shopkeeper felt indeed like a fish out of water, and as he\r\nafterwards declared he felt just as if he had had a red hot clock weight\r\nthrust into the midst of his stomach and there left to cool.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grocer would be revenged upon his tormentor, who had now\r\nlost sight of him, but the fat man, after a time, recovering his wind,\r\nand the pain in his stomach becoming less intense, he gathered himself\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"My name ain\'t Jones," he muttered, "if I don\'t be one to his one for\r\nthat; I\'ll do something that shall make him remember what it is to\r\ninsult a respectable tradesman. I\'ll never forgive such an insult. It is\r\ndark, and that\'s why it is he has dared to do this."\r\n\r\nFilled with dire thoughts and a spirit of revenge, he looked from side\r\nto side to see with what he could effect his object, but could espy\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s shameful," he muttered; "what would I give for a little retort.\r\nI\'d plaster his ugly countenance."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he placed his hands on some pales to rest himself, when he\r\nfound that they stuck to them, the pales had that day been newly\r\npitched.\r\n\r\nA bright idea now struck him.\r\n\r\n"If I could only get a handful of this stuff," he thought, "I should be\r\nable to serve him out for serving me out. I will, cost what it may; I\'m\r\nresolved upon that. I\'ll not have my wind knocked out, and my inside set\r\non fire for nothing. No, no; I\'ll be revenged on him."\r\n\r\nWith this view he felt over the pales, and found that he could scrape\r\noff a little only, but not with his hands; indeed, it only plastered\r\nthem; he, therefore, marched about for something to scrape it off with.\r\n\r\n"Ah; I have a knife, a large pocket knife, that will do, that is the\r\nsort of thing I want."\r\n\r\nHe immediately commenced feeling for it, but had scarcely got his hand\r\ninto his pocket when he found there would be a great difficulty in\r\neither pushing it in further or withdrawing it altogether, for the pitch\r\nmade it difficult to do either, and his pocket stuck to his hands like a\r\nglove.\r\n\r\n"D--n it," said the grocer, "who would have thought of that? here\'s a\r\npretty go, curse that fellow, he is the cause of all this; I\'ll be\r\nrevenged upon him, if it\'s a year hence."\r\n\r\nThe enraged grocer drew his hand out, but was unable to effect his\r\nobject in withdrawing the knife also; but he saw something shining, he\r\nstooped to pick it up, exclaiming as he did so, in a gratified tone of\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n"Ah, here\'s something that will do better."\r\n\r\nAs he made a grasp at it, he found he had inserted his hand into\r\nsomething soft.\r\n\r\n"God bless me! what now?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled his hand hastily away, and found that it stuck slightly, and\r\nthen he saw what it was.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, the very thing. Surely it must have been placed here on purpose\r\nby the people."\r\n\r\nThe fact was, he had placed his hand into a pot of pitch that had been\r\nleft by the people who had been at work at pitching the pales, but had\r\nbeen attracted by the fire at Sir Francis Varney\'s, and to see which\r\nthey had left their work, and the pitch was left on a smouldering peat\r\nfire, so that when Mr. Jones, the grocer, accidentally put his hand into\r\nit he found it just warm.\r\n\r\nWhen he made this discovery he dabbed his hand again into the pitch-pot,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"In for a penny, in for a pound."\r\n\r\nAnd he endeavoured to secure as large a handful of the slippery and\r\nsticky stuff as he could, and this done he set off to come up with the\r\nbig countryman who had done him so much indignity and made his stomach\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe soon came up with him, for the man had stopped rather behind, and was\r\nlarking, as it is called, with some men, to whom he was a companion.\r\n\r\nHe had slipped down a bank, and was partially sitting down on the soft\r\nmud. In his bustle, the little grocer came down with a slide, close to\r\nthe big countryman.\r\n\r\n"Ah--ah! my little grocer," said the countryman, holding out his hand to\r\ncatch him, and drawing him towards himself. "You will come and sit down\r\nby the side of your old friend."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he endeavoured to pull Mr. Jones down, too; but that\r\nindividual only replied by fetching the countryman a swinging smack\r\nacross the face with the handful of pitch.\r\n\r\n"There, take that; and now we are quits; we shall be old friends after\r\nthis, eh? Are you satisfied? You\'ll remember me, I\'ll warrant."\r\n\r\nAs the grocer spoke, he rubbed his hands over the face of the fallen\r\nman, and then rushed from the spot with all the haste he could make.\r\n\r\nThe countryman sat a moment or two confounded, cursing, and swearing,\r\nand spluttering, vowing vengeance, believing that it was mud only that\r\nhad been plastered over his face; but when he put his hands up, and\r\nfound out what it was, he roared and bellowed like a town-bull.\r\n\r\nHe cried out to his companions that his eyes were pitched: but they only\r\nlaughed at him, thinking he was having some foolish lark with them.\r\n\r\nIt was next day before he got home, for he wandered about all night: and\r\nit took him a week to wash the pitch off by means of grease; and ever\r\nafterwards he recollected the pitching of his face; nor did he ever\r\nforget the grocer.\r\n\r\nThus it was the whole party returned a long while after dark across the\r\nfields, with all the various accidents that were likely to befal such an\r\nassemblage of people.\r\n\r\nThe vampyre hunting cost many of them dear, for clothes were injured on\r\nall sides: hats lost, and shoes missing in a manner that put some of the\r\nrioters to much inconvenience. Soon afterwards, the military retired to\r\ntheir quarters; and the townspeople at length became tranquil and\r\nnothing more was heard or done that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE OF THE BANNERWORTHS FROM THE HALL.--THE NEW ABODE.--JACK\r\nPRINGLE, PILOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring that very evening, on which the house of Sir Francis Varney was\r\nfired by the mob, another scene, and one of different character, was\r\nenacted at Bannerworth Hall, where the owners of that ancient place were\r\ndeparting from it.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the latter part of the day, that Flora Bannerworth, Mrs.\r\nBannerworth, and Henry Bannerworth, were preparing themselves to depart\r\nfrom the house of their ancestors. The intended proprietor was, as we\r\nhave already been made acquainted with, the old admiral, who had taken\r\nthe place somewhat mysteriously, considering the way in which he usually\r\ndid business.\r\n\r\nThe admiral was walking up and down the lawn before the house, and\r\nlooking up at the windows every now and then; and turning to Jack\r\nPringle, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Jack, you dog."\r\n\r\n"Ay--ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"Mind you convoy these women into the right port; do you hear? and no\r\nmistaking the bearings; do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"These crafts want care; and you are pilot, commander, and all; so mind\r\nand keep your weather eye open."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir. I knows the craft well enough, and I knows the roads, too;\r\nthere\'ll be no end of foundering against the breakers to find where they\r\nlie."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jack; you needn\'t do that; but mind your bearings. Jack, mind\r\nyour bearings."\r\n\r\n"Never fear; I know \'em, well enough; my eyes ain\'t laid up in ordinary\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Eh? What do you mean by that, you dog, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; only I can see without helps to read, or glasses either; so I\r\nknow one place from another."\r\n\r\nThere was now some one moving within; and the admiral, followed by Jack\r\nPringle, entered the Hall. Henry Bannerworth was there. They were all\r\nready to go when the coach came for them, which the admiral had ordered\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n"Jack, you lubber; where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir, here am I."\r\n\r\n"Go, and station yourself up in some place where you can keep a good\r\nlook-out for the coach, and come and report when you see it."\r\n\r\n"Ay--ay, sir," said Jack, and away he went from the room, and stationed\r\nhimself up in one of the trees, that commanded a good view of the main\r\nroad for some distance.\r\n\r\n"Admiral Bell," said Henry, "here we are, trusting implicitly to you;\r\nand in doing so, I am sure I am doing right."\r\n\r\n"You will see that," said the admiral. "All\'s fair and honest as yet;\r\nand what is to come, will speak for itself."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t suffer from any of these nocturnal visits," said\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t much care about them; but old Admiral Bell don\'t strike his\r\ncolours to an enemy, however ugly he may look. No, no; it must be a\r\nbetter craft than his own that\'ll take him; and one who won\'t run away,\r\nbut that will grapple yard-arm and yard-arm, you know."\r\n\r\n"Why, admiral, you must have seen many dangers in your time, and be used\r\nto all kinds of disturbances and conflicts. You have had a life of\r\nexperience."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and experience has come pretty thick sometimes, I can tell you,\r\nwhen it comes in the shape of Frenchmen\'s broadsides."\r\n\r\n"I dare say, then, it must be rather awkward."\r\n\r\n"Death by the law," said the admiral, "to stop one of them with your\r\nhead, I assure you. I dare not make the attempt myself, though I have\r\noften seen it done."\r\n\r\n"I dare say; but here are Flora and my mother."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Flora and her mother entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n"Well, admiral, we are all ready; and, though I may feel somewhat sorry\r\nat leaving the old Hall, yet it arises from attachment to the place, and\r\nnot any disinclination to be beyond the reach of these dreadful alarms."\r\n\r\n"And I, too, shall be by no means sorry," said Flora; "I am sure it is\r\nsome gratification to know we leave a friend here, rather than some\r\nothers, who would have had the place, if they could have got it, by any\r\nmeans."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s true enough, Miss Flora," said the admiral; "but we\'ll run\r\nthe enemy down yet, depend upon it. But once away, you will be free from\r\nthese terrors; and now, as you have promised, do not let yourselves be\r\nseen any where at all."\r\n\r\n"You have our promises, admiral; and they shall be religiously kept, I\r\ncan assure you."\r\n\r\n"Boat, ahoy--ahoy!" shouted Jack.\r\n\r\n"What boat?" said the admiral, surprised; and then he muttered,\r\n"Confound you for a lubber! Didn\'t I tell you to mind your bearings, you\r\ndog-fish you?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir--and so I did."\r\n\r\n"You did."\r\n\r\n"Yes, here they are. Squint over the larboard bulk-heads, as they call\r\nwalls, and then atween the two trees on the starboard side of the\r\ncourse, then straight ahead for a few hundred fathoms, when you come to\r\na funnel as is smoking like the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and then in a\r\nline with that on the top of the hill, comes our boat."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the admiral, "that\'ll do. Now go open the gates, and keep a\r\nbright look out, and if you see anybody near your watch, why douse their\r\nglim."\r\n\r\n"Ay--ay, sir," said Jack, and he disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Rather a lucid description," said Henry, as he thought of Jack\'s report\r\nto the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a seaman\'s report. I know what he means; it\'s quicker and\r\nplainer than the land lingo, to my ears, and Jack can\'t talk any other,\r\nyou see."\r\n\r\nBy this time the coach came into the yard, and the whole party descended\r\ninto the court-yard, where they came to take leave of the old place.\r\n\r\n"Farewell, admiral."\r\n\r\n"Good bye," said the admiral. "I hope the place you are going to will be\r\nsuch as please you--I hope it will."\r\n\r\n"I am sure we shall endeavour to be pleased with it, and I am pretty\r\nsure we shall."\r\n\r\n"Good bye."\r\n\r\n"Farewell, Admiral Bell," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"You remember your promises?"\r\n\r\n"I do. Good bye, Mr. Chillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Good bye," said Mr. Chillingworth, who came up to bid them farewell; "a\r\npleasant journey, and may you all be the happier for it."\r\n\r\n"You do not come with us?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have some business of importance to attend to, else I should have\r\nthe greatest pleasure in doing so. But good bye; we shall not be long\r\napart, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Henry.\r\n\r\nThe door of the carriage was shut by the admiral, who looked round,\r\nsaying,--\r\n\r\n"Jack--Jack Pringle, where are you, you dog?"\r\n\r\n"Here am I," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been to?"\r\n\r\n"Only been for pigtail," said Jack. "I forgot it, and couldn\'t set sail\r\nwithout it."\r\n\r\n"You dog you; didn\'t I tell you to mind your bearings?"\r\n\r\n"So I will," said Jack, "fore and aft--fore and aft, admiral."\r\n\r\n"You had better," said the admiral, who, however, relaxed into a broad\r\ngrin, which he concealed from Jack Pringle.\r\n\r\nJack mounted the coach-box, and away it went, just as it was getting\r\ndark. The old admiral had locked up all the rooms in the presence of\r\nHenry Bannerworth; and when the coach had gone out of sight, Mr.\r\nChillingworth came back to the Hall, where he joined the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "they are gone, Admiral Bell, and we are alone; we have\r\na clear stage and no favour."\r\n\r\n"The two things of all others I most desire. Now, they will be strangers\r\nwhere they are going to, and that will be something gained. I will\r\nendeavour to do some thing if I get yard-arm and yard-arm with these\r\npirates. I\'ll make \'em feel the weight of true metal; I\'ll board\r\n\'em--d----e, I\'ll do everything."\r\n\r\n"Everything that can be done."\r\n\r\n"Ay--ay."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe coach in which the family of the Bannerworths were carried away\r\ncontinued its course without any let or hindrance, and they met no one\r\non their road during the whole drive. The fact was, nearly everybody was\r\nat the conflagration at Sir Francis Varney\'s house.\r\n\r\nFlora knew not which way they were going, and, after a time, all trace\r\nof the road was lost. Darkness set in, and they all sat in silence in\r\nthe coach.\r\n\r\nAt length, after some time had been spent thus, Flora Bannerworth turned\r\nto Jack Pringle, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Are we near, or have we much further to go?"\r\n\r\n"Not very much, ma\'am," said Jack. "All\'s right, however--ship in the\r\ndirect course, and no breakers ahead--no lookout necessary; however\r\nthere\'s a land-lubber aloft to keep a look out."\r\n\r\nAs this was not very intelligible, and Jack seemed to have his own\r\nreasons for silence, they asked him no further questions; but in about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, during which time the coach had been driving\r\nthrough the trees, they came to a standstill by a sudden pull of the\r\ncheck-string from Jack, who said,--\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!--take in sails, and drop anchor."\r\n\r\n"Is this the place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, here we are," said Jack; "we\'re in port now, at all events;" and\r\nhe began to sing,--\r\n\r\n    "The trials and the dangers of the voyage is past,"\r\n\r\nwhen the coach door opened, and they all got out and looked about them\r\nwhere they were.\r\n\r\n"Up the garden if you please, ma\'am--as quick as you can; the night air\r\nis very cold."\r\n\r\nFlora and her mother and brother took the hint, which was meant by Jack\r\nto mean that they were not to be seen outside. They at once entered a\r\npretty garden, and then they came to a very neat and picturesque\r\ncottage. They had no time to look up at it, as the door was immediately\r\nopened by an elderly female, who was intended to wait upon them.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Jack Pringle and the coachman entered the passage with the\r\nsmall amount of luggage which they had brought with them. This was\r\ndeposited in the passage, and then Jack went out again, and, after a few\r\nminutes, there was the sound of wheels, which intimated that the coach\r\nhad driven off.\r\n\r\nJack, however, returned in a few minutes afterwards, having secured the\r\nwicket-gate at the end of the garden, and then entered the house,\r\nshutting the door carefully after him.\r\n\r\nFlora and her mother looked over the apartments in which they were shown\r\nwith some surprise. It was, in everything, such as they could wish;\r\nindeed, though it could not be termed handsomely or extravagantly\r\nfurnished, or that the things were new, yet, there was all that\r\nconvenience and comfort could require, and some little of the luxuries.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Flora, "this is very thoughtful of the admiral. The place\r\nwill really be charming, and the garden, too, delightful."\r\n\r\n"Mustn\'t be made use of just now," said Jack, "if you please, ma\'am;\r\nthem\'s the orders at present."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Flora, smiling. "I suppose, Mr. Pringle, we must obey\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Jack Pringle, if you please," said Jack. "My commands only temporary. I\r\nain\'t got a commission."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE LONELY WATCH, AND THE ADVENTURE IN THE DESERTED HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is now quite night, and so peculiar and solemn a stillness reigns in\r\nand about Bannerworth Hall and its surrounding grounds, that one might\r\nhave supposed it a place of the dead, deserted completely after sunset\r\nby all who would still hold kindred with the living. There was not a\r\nbreath of air stirring, and this circumstance added greatly to the\r\nimpression of profound repose which the whole scene exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe wind during the day had been rather of a squally character, but\r\ntowards nightfall, as is often usual after a day of such a character, it\r\nhad completely lulled, and the serenity of the scene was unbroken even\r\nby the faintest sigh from a wandering zephyr.\r\n\r\nThe moon rose late at that period, and as is always the case at that\r\ninterval between sunset and the rising of that luminary which makes the\r\nnight so beautiful, the darkness was of the most profound character.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those nights to produce melancholy reflections--a night on\r\nwhich a man would be apt to review his past life, and to look into the\r\nhidden recesses of his soul to see if conscience could make a coward of\r\nhim in the loneliness and stillness that breathed around.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those nights in which wanderers in the solitude of nature\r\nfeel that the eye of Heaven is upon them, and on which there seems to be\r\na more visible connection between the world and its great Creator than\r\nupon ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nThe solemn and melancholy appear places once instinct with life, when\r\ndeserted by those familiar forms and faces that have long inhabited\r\nthem. There is no desert, no uninhabited isle in the far ocean, no wild,\r\nbarren, pathless tract of unmitigated sterility, which could for one\r\nmoment compare in point of loneliness and desolation to a deserted city.\r\n\r\nStrip London, mighty and majestic as it is, of the busy swarm of\r\nhumanity that throng its streets, its suburbs, its temples, its public\r\nedifices, and its private dwellings, and how awful would be the walk of\r\none solitary man throughout its noiseless thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf madness seized not upon him ere he had been long the sole survivor of\r\na race, it would need be cast in no common mould.\r\n\r\nAnd to descend from great things to smaller--from the huge leviathan\r\ncity to one mansion far removed from the noise and bustle of\r\nconventional life, we may imagine the sort of desolation that reigned\r\nthrough Bannerworth Hall, when, for the first time, after nearly a\r\nhundred and fifty years of occupation, it was deserted by the\r\nrepresentatives of that family, so many members of which had lived and\r\ndied beneath its roof. The house, and everything within, without, and\r\naround it, seemed actually to sympathize with its own desolation and\r\ndesertion.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if twenty years of continued occupation could not have\r\nproduced such an effect upon the ancient edifice as had those few hours\r\nof neglect and desertion.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not as if it had been stripped of those time-worn and\r\nancient relics of ornament and furnishing that so long had appertained\r\nto it. No, nothing but the absence of those forms which had been\r\naccustomed quietly to move from room to room, and to be met here upon a\r\nstaircase, there upon a corridor, and even in some of the ancient\r\npanelled apartments, which give it an air of dreary repose and\r\nlistlessness.\r\n\r\nThe shutters, too, were all closed, and that circumstance contributed\r\nlargely to the production of that gloomy effect which otherwise could\r\nnot have ensued.\r\n\r\nIn fact, what could be done without attracting very special observation\r\nwas done to prove to any casual observer that the house was untenanted.\r\n\r\nBut such was not really the case. In that very room where the much\r\ndreaded Varney the vampyre had made one of his dreaded appearances to\r\nFlora Bannerworth and her mother, sat two men.\r\n\r\nIt was from that apartment that Flora had discharged the pistol, which\r\nhad been left to her by her brother, and the shot from which it was\r\nbelieved by the whole family had most certainly taken effect upon the\r\nperson of the vampyre.\r\n\r\nIt was a room peculiarly accessible from the gardens, for it had long\r\nFrench windows opening to the very ground, and but a stone step\r\nintervened between the flooring of the apartment and a broad gravel walk\r\nwhich wound round that entire portion of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was in this room, then, that two men sat in silence, and nearly in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nBefore them, and on a table, were several articles of refreshment, as\r\nwell of defence and offence, according as their intentions might be.\r\n\r\nThere were a bottle and three glasses, and lying near the elbow of one\r\nof the men was a large pair of pistols, such as might have adorned the\r\nbelt of some desperate character, who wished to instil an opinion of his\r\nprowess into his foes by the magnitude of his weapons.\r\n\r\nClose at hand, by the same party, lay some more modern fire arms, as\r\nwell as a long dirk, with a silver mounted handle.\r\n\r\nThe light they had consisted of a large lantern, so constructed with a\r\nslide, that it could be completely obscured at a moment\'s notice; but\r\nnow as it was placed, the rays that were allowed to come from it were\r\ndirected as much from the window of the apartment, as possible, and fell\r\nupon the faces of the two men, revealing them to be Admiral Bell and Dr.\r\nChillingworth.\r\n\r\nIt might have been the effect of the particular light in which he sat,\r\nbut the doctor looked extremely pale, and did not appear at all at his\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, on the contrary, appeared in as placable a state of mind as\r\npossible and had his arms folded across his breast, and his head shrunk\r\ndown between his shoulders as if he had made up his mind to something\r\nthat was to last a long time, and, therefore he was making the best of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I do hope," said Mr. Chillingworth, after a long pause, "that our\r\nefforts will be crowned with success--you know, my dear sir, that I have\r\nalways been of your opinion, that there was a great deal more in this\r\nmatter than met the eye."\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said the admiral, "and as to our efforts being crowned\r\nwith success, why, I\'ll give you a toast, doctor, \'may the morning\'s\r\nreflection provide for the evening\'s amusement.\'"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!" said Chillingworth, faintly; "I\'d rather not drink any more,\r\nand you seem, admiral, to have transposed the toast in some way. I\r\nbelieve it runs, \'may the evening\'s amusement bear the morning\'s\r\nreflection.\'"\r\n\r\n"Transpose the devil!" said the admiral; "what do I care how it runs? I\r\ngave you my toast, and as to that you mention, it\'s another one\r\naltogether, and a sneaking, shore-going one too: but why don\'t you\r\ndrink?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear sir, medically speaking, I am strongly of opinion that,\r\nwhen the human stomach is made to contain a large quantity of alcohol,\r\nit produces bad effects upon the system. Now, I\'ve certainly taken one\r\nglass of this infernally strong Hollands, and it is now lying in my\r\nstomach like the red-hot heater of a tea-urn."\r\n\r\n"Is it? put it out with another, then."\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'m afraid that would not answer, but do you really think, admiral,\r\nthat we shall effect anything by waiting here, and keeping watch and\r\nward, not under the most comfortable circumstances, this first night of\r\nthe Hall being empty."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that we shall," said the admiral; "but when you\r\nreally want to steal a march upon the enemy, there is nothing like\r\nbeginning betimes. We are both of opinion that Varney\'s great object\r\nthroughout has been, by some means or another, to get possession of the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Yes; true, true."\r\n\r\n"We know that he has been unceasing in his endeavours to get the\r\nBannerworth family out of it; that he has offered them their own price\r\nto become its tenant, and that the whole gist of his quiet and placid\r\ninterview with Flora in the garden, was to supply her with a new set of\r\nreasons for urging her mother and brother to leave Bannerworth Hall,\r\nbecause the old ones were certainly not found sufficient."\r\n\r\n"True, true, most true," said Mr. Chillingworth, emphatically. "You\r\nknow, sir, that from the first time you broached that view of the\r\nsubject to me, how entirely I coincided with you."\r\n\r\n"Of course you did, for you are a honest fellow, and a right-thinking\r\nfellow, though you are a doctor, and I don\'t know that I like doctors\r\nmuch better than I like lawyers--they\'re only humbugs in a different\r\nsort of way. But I wish to be liberal; there is such a thing as an\r\nhonest lawyer, and, d----e, you\'re an honest doctor!"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m much obliged, admiral, for your good opinion. I only wish\r\nit had struck me to bring something of a solid nature in the shape of\r\nfood, to sustain the waste of the animal economy during the hours we\r\nshall have to wait here."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble yourself about that," said the admiral. "Do you think I\'m\r\na donkey, and would set out on a cruise without victualling my ship? I\r\nshould think not. Jack Pringle will be here soon, and he has my orders\r\nto bring in something to eat."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the doctor, "that\'s very provident of you, admiral, and I\r\nfeel personally obliged; but tell me, how do you intend to conduct the\r\nwatch?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I mean, if we sit here with the window fastened so as to prevent\r\nour light from being seen, and the door closed, how are we by any\r\npossibility to know if the house is attacked or not?"\r\n\r\n"Hark\'ee, my friend," said the admiral; "I\'ve left a weak point for the\r\nenemy."\r\n\r\n"A what, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"A weak point. I\'ve taken good care to secure everything but one of the\r\nwindows on the ground floor, and that I\'ve left open, or so nearly open,\r\nthat it will look like the most natural place in the world to get in at.\r\nNow, just inside that window, I\'ve placed a lot of the family crockery.\r\nI\'ll warrant, if anybody so much as puts his foot in, you\'ll hear the\r\nsmash;--and, d----e, there it is!"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud crash at this moment, followed by a succession of\r\nsimilar sounds, but of a lesser degree; and both the admiral and Mr.\r\nChillingworth sprung to their feet.\r\n\r\n"Come on," cried the former; "here\'ll be a precious row--take the\r\nlantern."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth did so, but he did not seem possessed of a great deal\r\nof presence of mind; for, before they got out of the room, he twice\r\naccidentally put on the dark slide, and produced a total darkness.\r\n\r\n"D--n!" said the admiral; "don\'t make it wink and wink in that way; hold\r\nit up, and run after me as hard as you can."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming, I\'m coming," said Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the windows of a long room, containing five, fronting the\r\ngarden, which the admiral had left purposely unguarded; and it was not\r\nfar from the apartment in which they had been sitting, so that,\r\nprobably, not half a minute\'s time elapsed between the moment of the\r\nfirst alarm, and their reaching the spot from whence it was presumed to\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had armed himself with one of the huge pistols, and he\r\ndashed forward, with all the vehemence of his character, towards the\r\nwindow, where he knew he had placed the family crockery, and where he\r\nfully expected to meet the reward of his exertion by discovering some\r\none lying amid its fragments.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was disappointed; for, although there was evidently\r\na great smash amongst the plates and dishes, the window remained closed,\r\nand there was no indication whatever of the presence of any one.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s odd," said the admiral; "I balanced them up amazingly\r\ncareful, and two of \'em edgeways--d---e, a fly would have knocked them\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"Mew," said, a great cat, emerging from under a chair.\r\n\r\n"Curse you, there you are," said the admiral. "Put out the light, put\r\nout the light; here we\'re illuminating the whole house for nothing."\r\n\r\nWith, a click went the darkening slide over the lantern, and all was\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a shrill, clear whistle came from the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVAL OF JACK PRINGLE.--MIDNIGHT AND THE VAMPYRE.--THE MYSTERIOUS\r\nHAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Bless me! what is that?" said Mr. Chillingworth; "what a very singular\r\nsound."\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise," said the admiral; "did you never hear that before?"\r\n\r\n"No; how should I?"\r\n\r\n"Lor, bless the ignorance of some people, that\'s a boatswain\'s call."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is," said Mr. Chillingworth; "is he going to call again?"\r\n\r\n"D----e, I tell ye it\'s a boatswain\'s call."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, d----e, if it comes to that," said Mr. Chillingworth, "what\r\ndoes he call here for?"\r\n\r\nThe admiral disdained an answer; but demanding the lantern, he opened\r\nit, so that there was a sufficient glimmering of light to guide him, and\r\nthen walked from the room towards the front door of the Hall.\r\n\r\nHe asked no questions before he opened it, because, no doubt, the signal\r\nwas preconcerted; and Jack Pringle, for it was he indeed who had\r\narrived, at once walked in, and the admiral barred the door with the\r\nsame precision with which it was before secured.\r\n\r\n"Well, Jack," he said, "did you see anybody?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Why, ye don\'t mean that--where?"\r\n\r\n"Where I bought the grub; a woman--"\r\n\r\n"D----e, you\'re a fool, Jack."\r\n\r\n"You\'re another."\r\n\r\n"Hilloa, ye scoundrel, what d\'ye mean by talking to me in that way? is\r\nthis your respect for your superiors?"\r\n\r\n"Ship\'s been paid off long ago," said Jack, "and I ain\'t got no\r\nsuperiors. I ain\'t a marine or a Frenchman."\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re drunk."\r\n\r\n"I know it; put that in your eye."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a scoundrel. Why, you know-nothing-lubber, didn\'t I tell you to\r\nbe careful, and that everything depended upon secrecy and caution? and\r\ndidn\'t I tell you, above all this, to avoid drink?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure you did."\r\n\r\n"And yet you come here like a rum cask."\r\n\r\n"Yes; now you\'ve had your say, what then?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better leave him alone," said Mr. Chillingworth; "it\'s no use\r\narguing with a drunken man."\r\n\r\n"Harkye, admiral," said Jack, steadying himself as well as he could.\r\n"I\'ve put up with you a precious long while, but I won\'t no longer;\r\nyou\'re so drunk, now, that you keeping bobbing up and down like the\r\nmizen gaff in a storm--that\'s my opinion--tol de rol."\r\n\r\n"Let him alone, let him alone," urged Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"The villain," said the admiral; "he\'s enough to ruin everything; now,\r\nwho would have thought that? but it\'s always been the way with him for a\r\nmatter of twenty years--he never had any judgment in his drink. When it\r\nwas all smooth sailing, and nothing to do, and the fellow might have got\r\nan extra drop on board, which nobody would have cared for, he\'s as sober\r\nas a judge; but, whenever there\'s anything to do, that wants a little\r\ncleverness, confound him, he ships rum enough to float a seventy-four."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to stand anything to drink," said Jack, "my old buffer?\r\nDo you recollect where you got your knob scuttled off Beyrout--how you\r\nfell on your latter end and tried to recollect your church cateckis, you\r\nold brute?--I\'s ashamed of you. Do you recollect the brown girl you\r\nbought for thirteen bob and a tanner, at the blessed Society Islands,\r\nand sold her again for a dollar, to a nigger seven feet two, in his\r\nnatural pumps? you\'re a nice article, you is, to talk of marines and\r\nswabs, and shore-going lubbers, blow yer. Do you recollect the little\r\nFrenchman that told ye he\'d pull your blessed nose, and I advised you to\r\nsoap it? do you recollect Sall at Spithead, as you got in at a port hole\r\nof the state cabin, all but her behind?"\r\n\r\n"Death and the devil!" said the admiral, breaking from the grasp of Mr.\r\nChillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Jack, "you\'ll come to \'em both one of these days, old cock,\r\nand no mistake."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have his life, I\'ll have his life," roared the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, sir," said Mr. Chillingworth, catching the admiral round the\r\nwaist. "My dear sir, recollect, now, if I may venture to advise you,\r\nAdmiral Bell, there\'s a lot of that fiery hollands you know, in the next\r\nroom; set firm down to that, and finish him off. I\'ll warrant him, he\'ll\r\nbe quiet enough."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you say?" cried Jack--"hollands!--who\'s got any?--next to\r\nrum and Elizabeth Baker, if I has an affection, it\'s hollands."\r\n\r\n"Jack!" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir!" said Jack, instinctively.\r\n\r\n"Come this way."\r\n\r\nJack staggered after him, and they all reached the room where the\r\nadmiral and Mr. Chillingworth had been sitting before the alarm.\r\n\r\n"There!" said the admiral, putting the light upon the table, and\r\npointing to the bottle; "what do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"I never thinks under such circumstances," said Jack. "Here\'s to the\r\nwooden walls of old England!"\r\n\r\nHe seized the bottle, and, putting its neck into his mouth, for a few\r\nmoments nothing was heard but a gurgling sound of the liquor passing\r\ndown his throat; his head went further and further back, until, at last,\r\nover he went, chair and bottle and all, and lay in a helpless state of\r\nintoxication on the floor.\r\n\r\n"So far, so good," said the admiral. "He\'s out of the way, at all\r\nevents."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll just loosen his neckcloth," said Mr. Chillingworth, "and then\r\nwe\'ll go and sit somewhere else; and I should recommend that, if\r\nanywhere, we take up our station in that chamber, once Flora\'s, where\r\nthe mysterious panelled portrait hangs, that bears so strong a\r\nresemblance to Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said the admiral. "What\'s that?"\r\n\r\nThey listened for a moment intently; and then, distinctly, upon the\r\ngravel path outside the window, they heard a footstep, as if some person\r\nwere walking along, not altogether heedlessly, but yet without any very\r\ngreat amount of caution or attention to the noise he might make.\r\n\r\n"Hist!" said the doctor. "Not a word. They come."\r\n\r\n"What do you say they for?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Because something seems to whisper me that Mr. Marchdale knows more of\r\nVarney, the vampyre, than ever he has chosen to reveal. Put out the\r\nlight."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--that\'ll do. The moon has risen; see how it streams through\r\nthe chinks of the shutters."\r\n\r\n"No, no--it\'s not in that direction, or our light would have betrayed\r\nus. Do you not see the beams come from that half glass-door leading to\r\nthe greenhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and there\'s the footstep again, or another."\r\n\r\nTramp, tramp came a footfall again upon the gravel path, and, as before,\r\ndied away upon their listening ears.\r\n\r\n"What do you say now," said Mr. Chillingworth--"are there not two?"\r\n\r\n"If they were a dozen," said the admiral, "although we have lost one of\r\nour force, I would tackle them. Let\'s creep on through the rooms in the\r\ndirection the footsteps went."\r\n\r\n"My life on it," said Mr. Chillingworth as they left the apartment, "if\r\nthis be Varney, he makes for that apartment where Flora slept, and which\r\nhe knows how to get admission to. I\'ve studied the house well, admiral,\r\nand to get to that window any one from here outside must take a\r\nconsiderable round. Come on--we shall be beforehand."\r\n\r\n"A good idea--a good idea. Be it so."\r\n\r\nJust allowing themselves sufficient light to guide them on the way from\r\nthe lantern, they hurried on with as much precipitation as the\r\nintricacies of the passage would allow, nor halted till they had reached\r\nthe chamber were hung the portrait which bore so striking and remarkable\r\na likeness to Varney, the vampyre.\r\n\r\nThey left the lamp outside the door, so that not even a straggling beam\r\nfrom it could betray that there were persons on the watch; and then, as\r\nquietly as foot could fall, they took up their station among the\r\nhangings of the antique bedstead, which has been before alluded to in\r\nthis work as a remarkable piece of furniture appertaining to that\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," said the admiral, "we\'ve distanced them?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly we have. It\'s unlucky that the blind of the window is down."\r\n\r\n"Is it? By Heaven, there\'s a d----d strange-looking shadow creeping over\r\nit."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth looked almost with suspended breath. Even he could not\r\naltogether get rid of a tremulous feeling, as he saw that the shadow of\r\na human form, apparently of very large dimensions, was on the outside,\r\nwith the arms spread out, as if feeling for some means of opening the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy now to have fired one of the pistols direct upon\r\nthe figure; but, somehow or another, both the admiral and Mr.\r\nChillingworth shrank from that course, and they felt much rather\r\ninclined to capture whoever might make his appearance, only using their\r\npistols as a last resource, than gratuitously and at once to resort to\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n"Who should you say that was?" whispered the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"D----e, he\'s ill-looking and big enough for anything--there\'s a noise!"\r\n\r\nThere was a strange cracking sound at the window, as if a pane of glass\r\nwas being very stealthily and quietly broken; and then the blind was\r\nagitated slightly, confusing much the shadow that was cast upon it, as\r\nif the hand of some person was introduced for the purpose of effecting a\r\ncomplete entrance into the apartment.\r\n\r\n"He\'s coming in," whispered the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Hush, for Heaven\'s sake!" said Mr. Chillingworth; "you will alarm him,\r\nand we shall lose the fruit of all the labour we have already bestowed\r\nupon the matter; but did you not say something, admiral, about lying\r\nunder the window and catching him by the leg?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; I did."\r\n\r\n"Go and do it, then; for, as sure as you are a living man, his leg will\r\nbe in in a minute."\r\n\r\n"Here goes," said the admiral; "I never suggest anything which I\'m\r\nunwilling to do myself."\r\n\r\nWhoever it was that now was making such strenuous exertions to get into\r\nthe apartment seemed to find some difficulty as regarded the fastenings\r\nof the window, and as this difficulty increased, the patience of the\r\nparty, as well as his caution deserted him, and the casement was rattled\r\nwith violence.\r\n\r\nWith a far greater amount of caution than any one from a knowledge of\r\nhis character would have given him credit for, the admiral crept forward\r\nand laid himself exactly under the window.\r\n\r\nThe depth of wood-work from the floor to the lowest part of the\r\nwindow-frame did not exceed above two feet; so that any one could\r\nconveniently step in from the balcony outride on to the floor of the\r\napartment, which was just what he who was attempting to effect an\r\nentrance was desirous of doing.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that, be he who he might, mortal or vampyre, he had\r\nsome acquaintance with the fastening of the window; for now he succeeded\r\nin moving it, and the sash was thrown open.\r\n\r\nThe blind was still an obstacle; but a vigorous pull from the intruder\r\nbrought that down on the prostrate admiral; and then Mr. Chillingworth\r\nsaw, by the moonlight, a tall, gaunt figure standing in the balcony, as\r\nif just hesitating for a moment whether to get head first or feet first\r\ninto the apartment.\r\n\r\nHad he chosen the former alternative he would need, indeed, to have been\r\nendowed with more than mortal powers of defence and offence to escape\r\ncapture, but his lucky star was in the ascendancy, and he put his foot\r\nin first.\r\n\r\nHe turned his side to the apartment and, as he did so, the blight\r\nmoonlight fell upon his face, enabling Mr. Chillingworth to see, without\r\nthe shadow of a doubt, that it was, indeed, Varney, the vampyre, who was\r\nthus stealthily making his entrance into Bannerworth Hall, according to\r\nthe calculation which had been made by the admiral upon that subject.\r\nThe doctor scarcely knew whether to be pleased or not at this discovery;\r\nit was almost a terrifying one, sceptical as he was upon the subject of\r\nvampyres, and he waited breathless for the issue of the singular and\r\nperilous adventure.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Admiral Bell deeply congratulated himself upon the success\r\nwhich was about to crown his stratagem for the capture of the intruder,\r\nbe he who he might, and he writhed with impatience for the foot to come\r\nsufficiently near him to enable him to grasp it.\r\n\r\nHis patience was not severely tried, for in another moment it rested\r\nupon his chest.\r\n\r\n"Boarders a hoy!" shouted the admiral, and at once he laid hold of the\r\ntrespasser. "Yard-arm to yard-arm, I think I\'ve got you now. Here\'s a\r\nprize, doctor! he shall go away without his leg if he goes away now. Eh!\r\nwhat! the light--d----e, he has--Doctor, the light! the light! Why\r\nwhat\'s this?--Hilloa, there!"\r\n\r\nDr. Chillingworth sprang into the passage, and procured the light--in\r\nanother moment he was at the side of the admiral, and the lantern slide\r\nbeing thrown back, he saw at once the dilemma into which his friend had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nThere he lay upon his back, grasping, with the vehemence of an embrace\r\nthat had in it much of the ludicrous, a long boot, from which the\r\nintruder had cleverly slipped his leg, leaving it as a poor trophy in\r\nthe hands of his enemies.\r\n\r\n"Why you\'ve only pulled his boot off," said the doctor; "and now he\'s\r\ngone for good, for he knows what we\'re about, and has slipped through\r\nyour fingers."\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bell sat up and looked at the boot with a rueful countenance.\r\n\r\n"Done again!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are done," said the doctor; "why didn\'t you lay hold of the\r\nleg while you were about it, instead of the boot? Admiral, are these\r\nyour tactics?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool," said the admiral; "put out the light and give me the\r\npistols, or blaze away yourself into the garden; a chance shot may do\r\nsomething. It\'s no use running after him; a stern chase is a long chase;\r\nbut fire away."\r\n\r\nAs if some parties below had heard him give the word, two loud reports\r\nfrom the garden immediately ensued, and a crash of glass testified to\r\nthe fact that some deadly missile had entered the room.\r\n\r\n"Murder!" said the doctor, and he fell flat upon his back. "I don\'t like\r\nthis at all; it\'s all in your line, admiral, but not in mine."\r\n\r\n"All\'s right, my lad," said the admiral; "now for it."\r\n\r\nHe saw lying in the moonlight the pistols which he and the doctor had\r\nbrought into the room, and in another moment he, to use his own words,\r\nreturned the broadside of the enemy.\r\n\r\n"D--n it!" he said, "this puts me in mind of old times. Blaze away, you\r\nthieves, while I load; broadside to broadside. It\'s your turn now; I\r\nscorn to take an advantage. What the devil\'s that?"\r\n\r\nSomething very large and very heavy came bang against the window,\r\nsending it all into the room, and nearly smothering the admiral with the\r\nfragments. Another shot was then fired, and in came something else,\r\nwhich hit the wall on the opposite side of the room, rebounding from\r\nthence on to the doctor, who gave a yell of despair.\r\n\r\nAfter that all was still; the enemy seemed to be satisfied that they had\r\nsilenced the garrison. And it took the admiral a great deal of kicking\r\nand plunging to rescue himself from some superincumbent mass that was\r\nupon him, which seemed to him to be a considerable sized tree.\r\n\r\n"Call this fair fighting," he shouted--"getting a man\'s legs and arms\r\ntangled up like a piece of Indian matting in the branches of a tree?\r\nDoctor, I say! hilloa! where are you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said the doctor; "but there\'s somebody getting into the\r\nbalcony--now we shall be murdered in cold blood!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the pistols?"\r\n\r\n"Fired off, of course; you did it yourself."\r\n\r\nBang came something else into the room, which, from the sound it made,\r\nclosely resembled a brick, and after that somebody jumped clean into the\r\ncentre of the floor, and then, after rolling and writhing about in a\r\nmost singular manner, slowly got up, and with various preliminary\r\nhiccups, said,--\r\n\r\n"Come on, you lubbers, many of you as like. I\'m the tar for all\r\nweathers."\r\n\r\n"Why, d----e," said the admiral, "it\'s Jack Pringle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," said Jack, who was not sufficiently sober to recognise the\r\nadmiral\'s voice. "I sees as how you\'ve heard of me. Come on, all of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jack, you scoundrel," roared the admiral, "how came you here?\r\nDon\'t you know me? I\'m your admiral, you horse-marine."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said Jack. "Ay--ay, sir, how came you here?"\r\n\r\n"How came you, you villain?"\r\n\r\n"Boarded the enemy."\r\n\r\n"The enemy who you boarded was us; and hang me if I don\'t think you\r\nhaven\'t been pouring broadsides into us, while the enemy were scudding\r\nbefore the wind in another direction."\r\n\r\n"Lor!" said Jack.\r\n\r\n"Explain, you scoundrel, directly--explain."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s only reasonable," said Jack; and giving a heavier lurch\r\nthan usual, he sat down with a great bounce upon the floor. "You see\r\nit\'s just this here,--when I was a coming of course I heard, just as I\r\nwas a going, that ere as made me come all in consequence of somebody a\r\ngoing, or for to come, you see, admiral."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," cried the admiral, in a great rage, "just help me out of this\r\nentanglement of branches, and I\'ll rid the world from an encumbrance by\r\nsmashing that fellow."\r\n\r\n"Smash yourself!" said Jack. "You know you\'re drunk."\r\n\r\n"My dear admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, laying hold of one of his\r\nlegs, and pulling it very hard, which brought his face into a lot of\r\nbrambles, "we\'re making a mess of this business."\r\n\r\n"Murder!" shouted the admiral; "you are indeed. Is that what you call\r\npulling me out of it? You\'ve stuck me fast."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll manage it," said Jack. "I\'ve seed him in many a scrape, and I\'ve\r\nseed him out. You pull me, doctor, and I\'ll pull him. Yo hoy!"\r\n\r\nJack laid hold of the admiral by the scuff of the neck, and the doctor\r\nlaid hold of Jack round the waist, the consequence of which was that he\r\nwas dragged out from the branches of the tree, which seemed to have been\r\nthrown into the room, and down fell both Jack and the doctor.\r\n\r\nAt this instant there was a strange hissing sound heard below the\r\nwindow; then there was a sudden, loud report, as if a hand-grenade had\r\ngone off. A spectral sort of light gleamed into the room, and a tall,\r\ngaunt-looking figure rose slowly up in the balcony.\r\n\r\n"Beware of the dead!" said a voice. "Let the living contend with the\r\nliving, the dead with the dead. Beware!"\r\n\r\nThe figure disappeared, as did also the strange, spectral-looking light.\r\nA death-like silence ensued, and the cold moonbeams streamed in upon the\r\nfloor of the apartment, as if nothing had occurred to disturb the\r\nwrapped repose and serenity of the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nTHE WARNING.--THE NEW PLAN OF OPERATION.--THE INSULTING MESSAGE FROM\r\nVARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo much of the night had been consumed in these operations, that by the\r\ntime they were over, and the three personages who lay upon the floor of\r\nwhat might be called the haunted chamber of Bannerworth Hall, even had\r\nthey now been disposed to seek repose, would have had a short time to do\r\nso before the daylight would have streamed in upon them, and roused them\r\nto the bustle of waking existence.\r\n\r\nIt may be well believed what a vast amount of surprise came over the\r\nthree persons in that chamber at the last little circumstance that had\r\noccurred in connection with the night\'s proceedings.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing which had preceded that, that did not resemble a\r\ngenuine attack upon the premises; but about that last mysterious\r\nappearance, with its curious light, there was quite enough to bother the\r\nadmiral and Jack Pringle to a considerable effect, whatever might be the\r\neffect upon Mr. Chillingworth, whose profession better enabled him to\r\ncomprehend, chemically, what would produce effects that, no doubt,\r\nastonished them amazingly.\r\n\r\nWhat with his intoxication and the violent exercise he had taken, Jack\r\nwas again thoroughly prostrate; while the admiral could not have looked\r\nmore astonished had the evil one himself appeared in _propria persona_\r\nand given him notice to quit the premises.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, the first to speak, and the words he spoke were\r\naddressed to Jack, to whom he said,--\r\n\r\n"Jack, you lubber, what do you think of all that?"\r\n\r\nJack, however, was too far gone even to say "Ay, ay, sir;" and Mr.\r\nChillingworth, slowly getting himself up to his feet, approached the\r\nadmiral.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to say so much, Admiral Bell," he said, "but it strikes me\r\nthat whatever object this Sir Francis Varney, or Varney, the vampyre,\r\nhas in coming into Bannerworth Hall, it is, at all events, of sufficient\r\nimportance to induce him to go any length, and not to let even a life to\r\nstand in the way of its accomplishment."\r\n\r\n"Well, it seems so," said the admiral; "for I\'ll be hanged if I can make\r\nhead or tail of the fellow."\r\n\r\n"If we value our personal safety, we shall hesitate to continue a\r\nperilous adventure which I think can end only in defeat, if not in\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"But we don\'t value our personal safety," said the admiral. "We\'ve got\r\ninto the adventure, and I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t carry it out. It\r\nmay be growing a little serious; but what of that? For the sake of that\r\nyoung girl, Flora Bannerworth, as well as for the sake of my nephew,\r\nCharles Holland, I will see the end of this affair, let it be what it\r\nmay; but mind you, Mr. Chillingworth, if one man chooses to go upon a\r\ndesperate service, that\'s no reason why he should ask another to do so."\r\n\r\n"I understand you," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but, having commenced the\r\nadventure with you, I am not the man to desert you in it. We have\r\ncommitted a great mistake."\r\n\r\n"A mistake! how?"\r\n\r\n"Why, we ought to have watched outside the house, instead of within it.\r\nThere can be no doubt that if we had lain in wait in the garden, we\r\nshould have been in a better position to have accomplished our object."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know, doctor, but it seems to me that if Jack Pringle\r\nhadn\'t made such a fool of himself, we should have managed very well:\r\nand I don\'t know now how he came to behave in the manner he did."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Mr. Chillingworth. "But, at all events, so far as the\r\nresult goes, it is quite clear that any further watching, in this house,\r\nfor the appearance of Sir Francis Varney, will now be in vain. He has\r\nnothing to do now but to keep quiet until we are tired out--a fact,\r\nconcerning which he can easily obtain information--and then he\r\nimmediately, without trouble, walks into the premises, to his own\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\n"But what the deuce can he want upon the premises?"\r\n\r\n"That question, admiral, induces me to think that we have made another\r\nmistake. We ought not to have attempted to surprise Sir Francis Varney\r\nin coming into Bannerworth Hall, but to catch him as he came out."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s something in that," said the admiral. "This is a pretty\r\nnight\'s business, to be sure. However, it can\'t be helped, it\'s done,\r\nand there\'s an end on\'t. And now, as the morning is near at hand, I\r\ncertainly must confess I should like to get some breakfast, although I\r\ndon\'t like that we should all leave the house together"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Mr. Chillingworth, "as we have now no secret to keep with\r\nregard to our being here, because the principal person we wished to keep\r\nit from is aware of it, I think we cannot do better than send at once\r\nfor Henry Bannerworth, tell him of the non-success of the effort we have\r\nmade in his behalf, and admit him at once into our consultation of what\r\nis next to be done."\r\n\r\n"Agreed, agreed, I think that, without troubling him, we might have\r\ncaptured this Varney; but that\'s over now, and, as soon as Jack Pringle\r\nchooses to wake up again, I\'ll send him to the Bannerworths with a\r\nmessage."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, suddenly; "all\'s right."\r\n\r\n"Why, you vagabond," said the admiral, "I do believe you\'ve been\r\nshamming!"\r\n\r\n"Shamming what?"\r\n\r\n"Being drunk, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Lor! couldn\'t do it," said Jack; "I\'ll just tell you how it was. I\r\nwakened up and found myself shut in somewhere; and, as I couldn\'t get\r\nout of the door, I thought I\'d try the window, and there I did get out.\r\nWell, perhaps I wasn\'t quite the thing, but I sees two people in the\r\ngarden a looking up at this ere room; and, to be sure, I thought it was\r\nyou and the doctor. Well, it warn\'t no business of mine to interfere, so\r\nI seed one of you climb up the balcony, as I thought, and then, after\r\nwhich, come down head over heels with such a run, that I thought you\r\nmust have broken your neck. Well, after that you fired a couple of shots\r\nin, and then, after that, I made sure it was you, admiral."\r\n\r\n"And what made you make sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Why, because you scuttled away like an empty tar-barrel in full tide."\r\n\r\n"Confound you, you scoundrel!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, confound you, if it comes to that. I thought I was doing\r\nyou good sarvice, and that the enemy was here, when all the while it\r\nturned out as you was and the enemy wasn\'t, and the enemy was outside\r\nand you wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"But who threw such a confounded lot of things into the room?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I did, of course; I had but one pistol, and, when I fired that\r\noff, I was forced to make up a broadside with what I could."\r\n\r\n"Was there ever such a stupid!" said the admiral; "doctor, doctor, you\r\ntalked of us making two mistakes; but you forgot a third and worse one\r\nstill, and that was the bringing such a lubberly son of a sea-cook into\r\nthe place as this fellow."\r\n\r\n"You\'re another," said Jack; "and you knows it."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "it\'s no use continuing it,\r\nadmiral; Jack, in his way, did, I dare say, what he considered for the\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"I wish he\'d do, then, what he considers for the worst, next time."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may," said Jack, "and then you will be served out above a\r\nbit. What \'ud become of you, I wonder, if it wasn\'t for me? I\'m as good\r\nas a mother to you, you knows that, you old babby."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth: "come down to the\r\ngarden-gate; it is now just upon daybreak, and the probability is that\r\nwe shall not be long there before we see some of the country people, who\r\nwill get us anything we require in the shape of refreshment; and as for\r\nJack, he seems quite sufficiently recovered now to go to the\r\nBannerworths\'."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I can go," said Jack; "as for that, the only thing as puts me out\r\nof the way is the want of something to drink. My constitution won\'t\r\nstand what they call temperance living, or nothing with the chill off."\r\n\r\n"Go at once," said the admiral, "and tell Mr. Henry Bannerworth that we\r\nare here; but do not tell him before his sister or his mother. If you\r\nmeet anybody on the road, send them here with a cargo of victuals. It\r\nstrikes me that a good, comfortable breakfast wouldn\'t be at all amiss,\r\ndoctor."\r\n\r\n"How rapidly the day dawns," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, as he walked\r\ninto the balcony from whence Varney, the vampire, had attempted to make\r\ngood his entrance to the Hall.\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke, and before Jack Pringle could get half way over to the\r\ngarden gate, there came a tremendous ring at the bell which was\r\nsuspended over it.\r\n\r\nA view of that gate could not be commanded from the window of the\r\nhaunted apartment, so that they could not see who it was that demanded\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nAs Jack Pringle was going down at any rate, they saw no necessity for\r\npersonal interference; and he proved that there was not, by presently\r\nreturning with a note which he said had been thrown over the gate by a\r\nlad, who then scampered off with all the speed he could make.\r\n\r\nThe note, exteriorly, was well got up, and had all the appearance of\r\ngreat care having been bestowed upon its folding and sealing.\r\n\r\nIt was duly addressed to "Admiral Bell, Bannerworth Hall," and the word\r\n"immediate" was written at one corner.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, after looking at it for some time with very great wonder,\r\ncame at last to the conclusion that probably to open it would be the\r\nshortest way of arriving at a knowledge of who had sent it, and he\r\naccordingly did so.\r\n\r\nThe note was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    "My dear sir,--Feeling assured that you cannot be surrounded\r\n    with those means and appliances for comfort in the Hall, in its\r\n    now deserted condition, which you have a right to expect, and so\r\n    eminently deserve, I flatter myself that I shall receive an\r\n    answer in the affirmative, when I request the favour of your\r\n    company to breakfast, as well as that of your learned friend.\r\n    Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n    "In consequence of a little accident which occurred last evening\r\n    to my own residence, I am, _ad interim_, until the county build\r\n    it up for me again, staying at a house called Walmesley Lodge,\r\n    where I shall expect you with all the impatience of one\r\n    soliciting an honour, and hoping that it will be conferred upon\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    "I trust that any little difference of opinion on other subjects\r\n    will not interfere to prevent the harmony of our morning\'s meal\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    "Believe me to be, my dear sir, with the greatest possible\r\n    consideration, your very obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\n    "FRANCIS VARNEY."\r\n\r\nThe admiral gasped again, and looked at Mr. Chillingworth, and then at\r\nthe note, and then at Mr. Chillingworth again, as if he was perfectly\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about the coolest piece of business," said Mr. Chillingworth,\r\n"that ever I heard of."\r\n\r\n"Hang me," said the admiral, "if I sha\'n\'t like the fellow at last. It\r\nis cool, and I like it because it is cool. Where\'s my hat? where\'s my\r\nstick!"\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"Accept his invitation, to be sure, and breakfast with him; and, my\r\nlearned friend, as he calls you, I hope you\'ll come likewise. I\'ll take\r\nthe fellow at his word. By fair means, or by foul, I\'ll know what he\r\nwants here; and why he persecutes this family, for whom I have an\r\nattachment; and what hand he has in the disappearance of my nephew,\r\nCharles Holland; for, as sure as there\'s a Heaven above us, he\'s at the\r\nbottom of that affair. Where is this Walmesley Lodge?"\r\n\r\n"Just in the neighbourhood; but--"\r\n\r\n"Come on, then; come on."\r\n\r\n"But, really, admiral, you don\'t mean to say you\'ll breakfast\r\nwith--with--"\r\n\r\n"A vampyre? Yes, I would, and will, and mean to do so. Here, Jack, you\r\nneedn\'t go to Mr. Bannerworth\'s yet. Come, my learned friend, let\'s take\r\nTime by the forelock."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERRUPTED BREAKFAST AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY\'S.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all Mr. Chillingworth could say to the contrary, the\r\nadmiral really meant to breakfast with Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nThe worthy doctor could not for some time believe but that the admiral\r\nmust be joking, when he talked in such a strain; but he was very soon\r\nconvinced to the contrary, by the latter actually walking out and once\r\nmore asking him, Mr. Chillingworth, if he meant to go with him, or not.\r\n\r\nThis was conclusive, so the doctor said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, admiral, this appears to me rather a mad sort of freak; but, as I\r\nhave begun the adventure with you, I will conclude it with you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said the admiral; "I\'m not deceived in you, doctor; so\r\ncome along. Hang these vampyres, I don\'t know how to tackle them,\r\nmyself. I think, after all, Sir Francis Varney is more in your line than\r\nline is in mine."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, couldn\'t you persuade him he\'s ill, and wants some physic? That\r\nwould soon settle him, you know."\r\n\r\n"Settle him!" said Mr. Chillingworth; "I beg to say that if I did give\r\nhim any physic, the dose would be much to his advantage; but, however,\r\nmy opinion is, that this invitation to breakfast is, after all, a mere\r\npiece of irony; and that, when we get to Walmesley Lodge, we shall not\r\nsee anything of him; on the contrary, we shall probably find it\'s a\r\nhoax."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shouldn\'t like that, but still it\'s worth the trying. The\r\nfellow has really behaved himself in such an extraordinary manner, that,\r\nif I can make terms with him I will; and there\'s one thing, you know,\r\ndoctor, that I think we may say we have discovered."\r\n\r\n"And what may that be? Is it, not to make too sure of a vampyre, even\r\nwhen you have him by the leg?"\r\n\r\n"No, that ain\'t it, though that\'s a very good thing in its way: but it\r\nis just this, that Sir Francis Varney, whoever he is and whatever he is,\r\nis after Bannerworth Hall, and not the Bannerworth family. If you\r\nrecollect, Mr. Chillingworth, in our conversation, I have always\r\ninsisted upon that fact."\r\n\r\n"You have; and it seems to me to be completely verified by the\r\nproceedings of the night. There, then, admiral, is the great\r\nmystery--what can he want at Bannerworth Hall that makes him take such a\r\nworld of trouble, and run so many fearful risks in trying to get at it?"\r\n\r\n"That is, indeed, the mystery; and if he really means this invitation to\r\nbreakfast, I shall ask him plumply, and tell him, at the same time, that\r\npossibly his very best way to secure his object will be to be candid,\r\nvampyre as he is."\r\n\r\n"But really, admiral, you do not still cling to that foolish\r\nsuperstition of believing that Sir Francis Varney is in reality a\r\nvampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, and I can\'t say; if anybody was to give me a description\r\nof a strange sort of fish that I had never seen, I wouldn\'t take upon\r\nmyself to say there wasn\'t such a thing; nor would you, doctor, if you\r\nhad really seen the many odd ones that I have encountered at various\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, admiral, I\'m certainly not belonging to that school of\r\nphilosophy which declares the impossible to be what it don\'t understand;\r\nthere may be vampyres, and there may be apparitions, for all I know to\r\nthe contrary; I only doubt these things, because I think, if they were\r\ntrue, that, as a phenomena of nature, they would have been by this time\r\nestablished by repeated instances without the possibility of doubt or\r\ncavil."\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s something in that; but how far have we got to go now?"\r\n\r\n"No further than to yon enclosure where you see those park-like looking\r\ngates, and that cedar-tree stretching its dark-green foliage so far into\r\nthe road; that is Walmesley Lodge, whither you have been invited."\r\n\r\n"And you, my learned friend, recollect that you were invited too; so\r\nthat you are no intruder upon the hospitality of Varney the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I say, admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, when they reached the gates,\r\n"you know it is not quite the thing to call a man a vampyre at his own\r\nbreakfast-table, so just oblige me by promising not to make any such\r\nremark to Sir Francis."\r\n\r\n"A likely thing!" said the admiral; "he knows I know what he is, and he\r\nknows I\'m a plain man and a blunt speaker; however, I\'ll be civil to\r\nhim, and more than that I can\'t promise. I must wring out of him, if I\r\ncan, what has become of Charles Holland, and what the deuce he really\r\nwants himself."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; come to no collision with him, while we\'re his guests."\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it."\r\n\r\nThe doctor rang at the gate bell of Walmesley Lodge, and was in a few\r\nmoments answered by a woman, who demanded their business.\r\n\r\n"Is Sir Francis Varney here?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! yes," she replied; "you see his house was burnt down, for\r\nsomething or other--I\'m sure I don\'t know what--by some people--I\'m sure\r\nI don\'t know who; so, as the lodge was to let, we have took him in till\r\nhe can suit himself."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s it, is it?" said the admiral--"tell him that Admiral Bell\r\nand Dr. Chillingworth are here."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the woman; "you may walk in."\r\n\r\n"Thank ye; you\'re vastly obliging, ma\'am. Is there anything going on in\r\nthe breakfast line?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I am getting him some breakfast, but he didn\'t say as he\r\nexpected company."\r\n\r\nThe woman opened the garden gate, and they walked up a trimly laid out\r\ngarden to the lodge, which was a cottage-like structure in external\r\nappearance, although within it boasted of all the comforts of a\r\ntolerably extensive house.\r\n\r\nShe left them in a small room, leading from the hall, and was absent\r\nabout five minutes; then she returned, and, merely saying that Sir\r\nFrancis Varney presented his compliments, and desired them to walk up\r\nstairs, she preceded them up a handsome flight which led to the first\r\nfloor of the lodge.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment, Mr. Chillingworth had expected some excuse, for,\r\nnotwithstanding all he had heard and seen of Sir Francis Varney, he\r\ncould not believe that any amount of impudence would suffice to enable\r\nhim to receive people as his guests, with whom he must feel that he was\r\nat such positive war.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular circumstance; and, perhaps, the only thing that\r\nmatched the cool impertinence of the invitation, was the acceptance of\r\nit under the circumstances by the admiral.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney might have intended it as a jest; but if he did so,\r\nin the first instance, it was evident he would not allow himself to be\r\nbeaten with his own weapons.\r\n\r\nThe room into which they were shown was a longish narrow one; a very\r\nwide door gave them admission to it, at the end, nearest the staircase,\r\nand at its other extremity there was a similar door opening into some\r\nother apartments of the house.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney sat with his back towards this second door, and a\r\ntable, with some chairs and other articles of furniture, were so\r\narranged before him, that while they seemed but to be carelessly placed\r\nin the position they occupied, they really formed a pretty good barrier\r\nbetween him and his visitors.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, however, was too intent upon getting a sight of Varney, to\r\nnotice any preparation of this sort, and he advanced quickly into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAnd there, indeed, was the much dreaded, troublesome, persevering, and\r\nsingular looking being who had caused such a world of annoyance to the\r\nfamily of the Bannerworths, as well as disturbing the peace of the whole\r\ndistrict, which had the misfortune to have him as an inhabitant.\r\n\r\nIf anything, he looked thinner, taller, and paler than usual, and there\r\nseemed to be a slight nervousness of manner about him, as he slowly\r\ninclined his head towards the admiral, which was not quite intelligible.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Admiral Bell, "you invited me to breakfast, and my learned\r\nfriend; here we are."\r\n\r\n"No two human beings," said Varney, "could be more welcome to my\r\nhospitality than yourself and Dr. Chillingworth. I pray you to be\r\nseated. What a pleasant thing it is, after the toils and struggles of\r\nthis life, occasionally to sit down in the sweet companionship of such\r\ndear friends."\r\n\r\nHe made a hideous face as he spoke, and the admiral looked as if he were\r\nhalf inclined to quarrel at that early stage of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n"Dear friends!" he said; "well, well--it\'s no use squabbling about a\r\nword or two; but I tell you what it is, Mr. Varney, or Sir Francis\r\nVarney, or whatever your d----d name is--"\r\n\r\n"Hold, my dear sir," said Varney--"after breakfast, if you please--after\r\nbreakfast."\r\n\r\nHe rang a hand-bell as he spoke, and the woman who had charge of the\r\nhouse brought in a tray tolerably covered with the materials for a\r\nsubstantial morning\'s meal. She placed it upon the table, and certainly\r\nthe various articles that smoked upon it did great credit to her\r\nculinary powers.\r\n\r\n"Deborah," said Sir Varney, in a mild sort of tone, "keep on continually\r\nbringing things to eat until this old brutal sea ruffian has satiated\r\nhis disgusting appetite."\r\n\r\nThe admiral opened his eyes an enormous width, and, looking at Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, he placed his two fists upon the table, and drew a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Did you address those observations to me," he said, at length, "you\r\nblood-sucking vagabond?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said Sir Francis Varney, looking over the admiral\'s head, as if he\r\nsaw something interesting on the wall beyond.\r\n\r\n"My dear admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, "come away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you d----d first!" said the admiral. "Now, Mr. Vampyre, no\r\nshuffling; did you address those observations to me?"\r\n\r\n"Deborah," said Sir Francis Varney, in silvery tones, "you can remove\r\nthis tray and bring on the next."\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it," said the admiral "I came to breakfast, and I\'ll have\r\nit; after breakfast I\'ll pull your nose--ay, if you were fifty vampyres,\r\nI\'d do it."\r\n\r\n"Dr. Chillingworth," said Varney, without paying the least attention to\r\nwhat the admiral said, "you don\'t eat, my dear sir; you must be fatigued\r\nwith your night\'s exertions. A man of your age, you know, cannot be\r\nsupposed to roll and tumble about like a fool in a pantomime with\r\nimpunity. Only think what a calamity it would be if you were laid up.\r\nYour patients would all get well, you know."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney," said Mr. Chillingworth, "we\'re your guests; we\r\ncome here at your invitation to partake of a meal. You have wantonly\r\nattacked both of us. I need not say that by so doing you cast a far\r\ngreater slur upon your own taste and judgment than you can upon us."\r\n\r\n"Admirably spoken," said Sir Francis Varney, giving his hands a clap\r\ntogether that made the admiral jump again. "Now, old Bell, I\'ll fight\r\nyou, if you think yourself aggrieved, while the doctor sees fair play."\r\n\r\n"Old who?" shouted the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Bell, Bell--is not your name Bell?--a family cognomen, I presume, on\r\naccount of the infernal clack, clack, without any sense in it, that is\r\nthe characteristic of your race."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll fight me?" said the admiral, jumping up.\r\n\r\n"Yes; if you challenge me."\r\n\r\n"By Jove I do; of course"\r\n\r\n"Then I accept it; and the challenged party, you know well, or ought to\r\nknow, can make his own terms in the encounter."\r\n\r\n"Make what terms you please; I care not what they are. Only say you will\r\nfight, and that\'s sufficient."\r\n\r\n"It is well," said Sir Francis Varney, in a solemn tone.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," interrupted Mr. Chillingworth; "this is boyish folly."\r\n\r\n"Hold your row," said the admiral, "and let\'s hear what he\'s got to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"In this mansion," said Sir Francis Varney--"for a mansion it is,\r\nalthough under the unpretending name of a lodge--in this mansion there\r\nis a large apartment which was originally fitted up by a scientific\r\nproprietor of the place, for the purpose of microscopic and other\r\nexperiments, which required a darkness total and complete, such a\r\ndarkness as seems as if it could be felt--palpable, thick, and obscure\r\nas the darkness of the tomb, and I know what that is."\r\n\r\n"The devil you do!" said this admiral "It\'s damp, too, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"The room?"\r\n\r\n"No; the grave."\r\n\r\n"Oh! uncommonly, after autumnal rains. But to resume--this room is\r\nlarge, lofty, and perfectly empty."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I propose that we procure two scythes."\r\n\r\n"Two what?"\r\n\r\n"Scythes, with their long handles, and their convenient holding places."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be hanged! What next do you propose?"\r\n\r\n"You may be hanged. The next is, that with these scythes we be both of\r\nus placed in the darkened room, and the door closed, and doubly locked\r\nupon us for one hour, and that then and there we do our best each to cut\r\nthe other in two. If you succeed in dismembering me, you will have won\r\nthe day; but I hope, from my superior agility"--here Sir Francis jumped\r\nupon his chair, and sat upon the back of it--"to get the better of you.\r\nHow do you like the plan I have proposed? Does it meet your wishes?"\r\n\r\n"Curse your impudence!" said the admiral, placing his elbows upon the\r\ntable and resting his chin in astonishment upon his two hands.\r\n\r\n"Nay," interrupted Sir Francis, "you challenged me; and, besides, you\'ll\r\nhave an equal chance, you know that. If you succeed in striking me\r\nfirst, down I go; whereas it I succeed in striking you first, down you\r\ngo."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Sir Francis Varney stretched out his foot, and closed a\r\nsmall bracket which held out the flap of the table on which the admiral\r\nwas leaning, and, accordingly, down the admiral went, tea-tray and all.\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth ran to help him up, and, when they both recovered\r\ntheir feet, they found they were alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.--THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUICIDE AT BANNERWORTH\r\nHALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Hilloa where the deuce is he?" said the admiral. "Was there ever such a\r\nconfounded take-in?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I really don\'t know," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but it seems to me\r\nthat he must have gone out of that door that was behind him: I begin, do\r\nyou know, admiral, to wish--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That we had never come here at all; and I think the sooner we get out\r\nof it the better."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I am not going to be hoaxed and humbugged in this way. I will\r\nhave satisfaction, but not with those confounded scythes and things he\r\ntalks about in the dark room. Give me broad daylight and no favour;\r\nyardarm and yardarm; broadside and broadside; hand-grenades and\r\nmarling-spikes."\r\n\r\n"Well, but that\'s what he won\'t do. Now, admiral, listen to me."\r\n\r\n"Well, go on; what next?"\r\n\r\n"Come away at once."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you said that before."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I\'m going to say something else. Look round you. Don\'t you\r\nthink this a large, scientific-looking room?"\r\n\r\n"What of that?"\r\n\r\n"Why, what if suppose it was to become as dark as the grave, and Varney\r\nwas to enter with his scythe, that he talks of, and begin mowing about\r\nour legs."\r\n\r\n"The devil! Come along!"\r\n\r\nThe door at which they entered was at this moment opened, and the old\r\nwoman made her appearance.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," she said, "here\'s a Mr. Mortimer," in a loud voice. "Oh,\r\nSir Francis ain\'t here! Where\'s he gone, gentlemen?"\r\n\r\n"To the devil!" said the admiral. "Who may Mr. Mortimer be?"\r\n\r\nThere walked past the woman a stout, portly-looking man, well dressed,\r\nbut with a very odd look upon his face, in consequence of an obliquity\r\nof vision, which prevented the possibility of knowing which way he was\r\nlooking.\r\n\r\n"I must see him," he said; "I must see him."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth started back as if in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" he cried, "you here!"\r\n\r\n"Confusion!" said Mortimer; "are you Dr.---- Dr.----"\r\n\r\n\r\n"The same. Hush! there is no occasion to betray--that is, to state my\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\n"And mine, too," said Chillingworth. "But what brings you here?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot and dare not tell you. Farewell!"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly, and was leaving the room; but he ran against some\r\none at the entrance, and in another moment Henry Bannerworth, heated and\r\nalmost breathless by evident haste, made his appearance.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! bravo!" cried the admiral; "the more the merrier! Here\'s a\r\ncombined squadron! Why, how came you here, Mr. Henry Bannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"Bannerworth!" said Mortimer; "is that young man\'s name Bannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry. "Do you know me, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; only I--I--must be off. Does anybody know anything of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney?"\r\n\r\n"We did know something of him," said the admiral, "a little while ago;\r\nbut he\'s taken himself off. Don\'t you do so likewise. If you\'ve got\r\nanything to say, stop and say it, like an Englishman."\r\n\r\n"Stuff! stuff!" said Mortimer, impatiently. "What do you all want here?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Sir Francis Varney," said Henry,--"and I care not if the whole\r\nworld heard it--is the persecutor of my family."\r\n\r\n"How? in what way?"\r\n\r\n"He has the reputation of a vampyre; he has hunted me and mine from\r\nhouse and home."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Dr. Chillingworth; "and, by some means or another, he seems\r\ndetermined to get possession of Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen," said Mortimer, "I promise you that I will inquire\r\ninto this. Mr. Chillingworth, I did not expect to meet you. Perhaps the\r\nleast we say to each other is, after all, the better."\r\n\r\n"Let me ask but one question," said Dr. Chillingworth, imploringly.\r\n\r\n"Ask it."\r\n\r\n"Did he live after--"\r\n\r\n"Hush! he did."\r\n\r\n"You always told me to the contrary."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I had an object; the game is up. Farewell; and, gentlemen, as I am\r\nmaking my exit, let me do so with a sentiment:--Society at large is\r\ndivided into two great classes."\r\n\r\n"And what may they be?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Those who have been hanged, and those who have not. Adieu!"\r\n\r\nHe turned and left the room; and Mr. Chillingworth sunk into a chair,\r\nand said, in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s uncommonly true; and I\'ve found out an acquaintance among the\r\nformer."\r\n\r\n"-D--n it! you seem all mad," said the admiral. "I can\'t make out what\r\nyou are about. How came you here, Mr. Henry Bannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"By mere accident I heard," said Henry, "that you were keeping watch and\r\nward in the Hall. Admiral, it was cruel, and not well done of you, to\r\nattempt such an enterprise without acquainting me with it. Did you\r\nsuppose for a moment that I, who had the greatest interest in this\r\naffair, would have shrunk from danger, if danger there be; or lacked\r\nperseverance, if that quality were necessary in carrying out any plan by\r\nwhich the safety and honour of my family might be preserved?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, now, my young friend," said Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Nay, sir; but I take it ill that I should have been kept out of this\r\naffair; and it should have been sedulously, as it were, kept a secret\r\nfrom me."\r\n\r\n"Let him go on as he likes," said the admiral; "boys will be boys. After\r\nall, you know, doctor, it\'s my affair, and not yours. Let him say what\r\nhe likes; where\'s the odds? It\'s of no consequence."\r\n\r\n"I do not expect. Admiral Bell," said Henry, "that it is to you; but it\r\nis to me."\r\n\r\n"Psha!"\r\n\r\n"Respecting you, sir, as I do--"\r\n\r\n"Gammon!"\r\n\r\n"I must confess that I did expect--"\r\n\r\n"What you didn\'t get; therefore, there\'s an end of that. Now, I tell you\r\nwhat, Henry, Sir Francis Varney is within this house; at least, I have\r\nreason to suppose so."\r\n\r\n"Then," exclaimed Henry, impetuously, "I will wring from him answers to\r\nvarious questions which concern my peace and happiness."\r\n\r\n"Please, gentlemen," said the woman Deborah, making her appearance, "Sir\r\nFrancis Varney has gone out, and he says I\'m to show you all the door,\r\nas soon as it is convenient for you all to walk out of it."\r\n\r\n"I feel convinced," said Mr. Chillingworth, "that it will be a useless\r\nsearch now to attempt to find Sir Francis Varney here. Let me beg of you\r\nall to come away; and believe me that I do not speak lightly, or with a\r\nview to get you from here, when I say, that after I have heard something\r\nfrom you, Henry, which I shall ask you to relate to me, painful though\r\nit may be, I shall be able to suggest some explanation of many things\r\nwhich appear at present obscure, and to put you in a course of freeing\r\nyou from the difficulties which surround you, which, Heaven knows, I\r\nlittle expected I should have it in my power to propose to any of you."\r\n\r\n"I will follow your advice, Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry; "for I have\r\nalways found that it has been dictated by good feeling as well as\r\ncorrect judgment. Admiral Bell, you will oblige me much by coming away\r\nwith me now and at once."\r\n\r\n"Well," remarked the admiral, "if the doctor has really something to\r\nsay, it alters the appearance of things, and, of course, I have no\r\nobjection."\r\n\r\nUpon this, the whole three of them immediately left the place, and it\r\nwas evident that Mr. Chillingworth had something of an uncomfortable\r\ncharacter upon his mind. He was unusually silent and reserved, and, when\r\nhe did speak, he seemed rather inclined to turn the conversation upon\r\nindifferent topics, than to add anything more to what he had said upon\r\nthe deeply interesting one which held so foremost a place in all their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n"How is Flora, now," he asked of Henry, "since her removal?"\r\n\r\n"Anxious still," said Henry; "but, I think, better."\r\n\r\n"That is well. I perceive that, naturally, we are all three walking\r\ntowards Bannerworth Hall, and, perhaps, it is as well that on that spot\r\nI should ask of you, Henry, to indulge me with a confidence such as,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, I should not at all feel myself justified\r\nin requiring of you."\r\n\r\n"To what does it relate?" said Henry. "You may be assured, Mr.\r\nChillingworth, that I am not likely to refuse my confidence to you, whom\r\nI have so much reason to respect as an attached friend of myself and my\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"You will not object, likewise, I hope," added Mr. Chillingworth, "to\r\nextend that confidence to Admiral Bell; for, as you well know, a truer\r\nand more warm-hearted man than he does not exist."\r\n\r\n"What do you expect for that, doctor?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing," said Henry, "that I could relate at all, that I\r\nshould shrink from relating to Admiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy," said the admiral, "and all I can reply to that is, you\r\nare quite right; for there can be nothing that you need shrink from\r\ntelling me, so far as regards the fact of trusting me with it goes."\r\n\r\n"I am assured of that."\r\n\r\n"A British officer, once pledging his word, prefers death to breaking\r\nit. Whatever you wish kept secret in the communication you make to me,\r\nsay so, and it will never pass my lips."\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, the fact is," said Henry, "that what I am about to relate to\r\nyou consists not so much of secrets as of matters which would be painful\r\nto my feelings to talk of more than may be absolutely required."\r\n\r\n"I understand you."\r\n\r\n"Let me, for a moment," said Mr Chillingworth, "put myself right. I do\r\nnot suspect, Mr. Henry Bannerworth, that you fancy I ask you to make a\r\nrecital of circumstances which must be painful to you from any idle\r\nmotive. But let me declare that I have now a stronger impulse, which\r\ninduces me to wish to hear from your own lips those matters which\r\npopular rumour may have greatly exaggerated or vitiated."\r\n\r\n"It is scarcely possible," remarked Henry, sadly, "that popular rumour\r\nshould exaggerate the facts."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"No. They are, unhappily, of themselves, in their bare truthfulness, so\r\nfull of all that can be grievous to those who are in any way connected\r\nwith them, that there needs no exaggeration to invest them with more\r\nterror, or with more of that sadness which must ever belong to a\r\nrecollection of them in my mind."\r\n\r\nIn suchlike discourse as this, the time was passed, until Henry\r\nBannerworth and his friends once more reached the Hall, from which he,\r\nwith his family, had so recently removed, in consequence of the fearful\r\npersecution to which they had been subjected.\r\n\r\nThey passed again into the garden which they all knew so well, and then\r\nHenry paused and looked around him with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an inquiring glance from Mr. Chillingworth, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Is it not strange, now, that I should have only been away from here a\r\nspace of time which may be counted by hours, and yet all seems changed.\r\nI could almost fancy that years had elapsed since I had looked at it."\r\n\r\n"Oh," remarked the doctor, "time is always by the imagination measured\r\nby the number of events which are crowded into a given space of it, and\r\nnot by its actual duration. Come into the house; there you will find all\r\njust as you left it, Henry, and you can tell us your story at leisure."\r\n\r\n"The air," said Henry, "about here is fresh and pleasant. Let us sit\r\ndown in the summer-house yonder, and there I will tell you all. It has a\r\nlocal interest, too, connected with the tale."\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to, and, in a few moments, the admiral, Mr.\r\nChillingworth, and Henry were seated in the same summer-house which had\r\nwitnessed the strange interview between Sir Francis Varney and Flora\r\nBannerworth, in which he had induced her to believe that he felt for the\r\ndistress he had occasioned her, and was strongly impressed with the\r\ninjustice of her sufferings.\r\n\r\nHenry was silent for some few moments, and then he said, with a deep\r\nsigh, as he looked mournfully around him,--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"It was on this spot that my father breathed his last, and hence have I\r\nsaid that it has a local interest in the tale I have to tell, which\r\nmakes it the most fitting place in which to tell it."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the admiral, "he died here, did he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, where you are now sitting."\r\n\r\n"Very good, I have seen many a brave man die in my time, and I hope to\r\nsee a few more, although, I grant you, the death in the heat of\r\nconflict, and fighting for our country, is a vastly different thing to\r\nsome shore-going mode of leaving the world."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry, as if pursuing his own meditations, rather than\r\nlistening to the admiral. "Yes, it was from this precise spot that my\r\nfather took his last look at the ancient house of his race. What we can\r\nnow see of it, he saw of it with his dying eyes and many a time I have\r\nsat here and fancied the world of terrible thoughts that must at such a\r\nmoment have come across his brain."\r\n\r\n"You might well do so," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"You see," added Henry, "that from here the fullest view you have of any\r\nof the windows of the house is of that of Flora\'s room, as we have\r\nalways called it, because for years she had had it as her chamber; and,\r\nwhen all the vegetation of summer is in its prime, and the vine which\r\nyou perceive crawls over this summer-house is full of leaf and fruit,\r\nthe view is so much hindered that it is difficult, without making an\r\nartificial gap in the clustering foliage, to see anything but the\r\nwindow."\r\n\r\n"So I should imagine," replied Mr. Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"You, doctor," added Henry, "who know much of my family, need not be\r\ntold what sort of man my father was."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"But you, Admiral Bell, who do not know, must be told, and, however\r\ngrievous it may be to me to have to say so, I must inform you that he\r\nwas not a man who would have merited your esteem."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the admiral, "you know, my boy, that can make no difference\r\nas regards you in anybody\'s mind, who has got the brains of an owl.\r\nEvery man\'s credit, character, and honour, to my thinking, is in his own\r\nmost special keeping, and let your father be what he might, or who he\r\nmight, I do not see that any conduct of his ought to raise upon your\r\ncheek the flush of shame, or cost you more uneasiness than ordinary good\r\nfeeling dictates to the errors and feelings of a fellow creature."\r\n\r\n"If all the world," said Henry, "would take such liberal and\r\ncomprehensive views as you do, admiral, it would be much happier than it\r\nis; but such is not the case, and people are but too apt to blame one\r\nperson for the evil that another has done."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but," said Mr. Chillingworth, "it so happens that those are the\r\npeople whose opinions are of the very least consequence."\r\n\r\n"There is some truth in that," said Henry, sadly; "but, however, let me\r\nproceed; since I have to tell the tale, I could wish it over. My father,\r\nthen, Admiral Bell, although a man not tainted in early life with vices,\r\nbecame, by the force of bad associates, and a sort of want of\r\ncongeniality and sentiment that sprang up between him and my mother,\r\nplunged into all the excesses of his age."\r\n\r\n"These excesses were all of that character which the most readily lay\r\nhold strongly of an unreflecting mind, because they all presented\r\nthemselves in the garb of sociality.\r\n\r\n"The wine cup is drained in the name of good fellowship; money which is\r\nwanted for legitimate purposes is squandered under the mask of a noble\r\nand free generosity, and all that the small imaginations of a number of\r\npersons of perverted intellects could enable them to do, has been done\r\nfrom time to time, to impart a kind of lustre to intemperance and all\r\nits dreadful and criminal consequences.\r\n\r\n"My father, having once got into the company of what he considered wits\r\nand men of spirit, soon became thoroughly vitiated. He was almost the\r\nonly one of the set among whom he passed what he considered his highly\r\nconvivial existence, who was really worth anything, pecuniarily\r\nspeaking. There were some among them who might have been respectable\r\nmen, and perchance carved their way to fortune, as well as some others\r\nwho had started in life with good patrimonies; but he, my father, at the\r\ntime he became associated with them, was the only one, as I say, who, to\r\nuse a phrase I have heard myself from his lips concerning them, had got\r\na feather to fly with.\r\n\r\n"The consequence of this was, that his society, merely for the sake of\r\nthe animal gratification of drinking at his expense was courted, and he\r\nwas much flattered, all of which he laid to the score of his own merits,\r\nwhich had been found out, and duly appreciated by these _bon vivants_,\r\nwhile he considered that the grave admonitions of his real friends\r\nproceeded from nothing in the world but downright envy and malice.\r\n\r\n"Such a state of things as this could not last very long. The associates\r\nof my father wanted money as well as wine, so they introduced him to the\r\ngaming-table, and he became fascinated with the fearful vice to an\r\nextent which predicted his own destruction and the ruin of every one who\r\nwas in any way dependent upon him.\r\n\r\n"He could not absolutely sell Bannerworth Hall, unless I had given my\r\nconsent, which I refused; but he accumulated debt upon debt, and from\r\ntime to time stripped the mansion of all its most costly contents.\r\n\r\n"With various mutations of fortune, he continued this horrible and\r\nbaneful career for a long time, until, at last, he found himself utterly\r\nand irretrievably ruined, and he came home in an agony of despair, being\r\nso weak, and utterly ruined in constitution, that he kept his bed for\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n"It appeared, however, that something occurred at this juncture which\r\ngave him actually, or all events awakened a hope that he should possess\r\nsome money, and be again in a position to try his fortune at the\r\ngaming-table.\r\n\r\n"He rose, and, fortifying himself once more with the strong stimulant of\r\nwine and spirits, he left his home, and was absent for about two months.\r\n\r\n"What occurred to him during that time we none of us ever knew, but late\r\none night he came home, apparently much flurried in manner, and seeming\r\nas if something had happened to drive him half mad.\r\n\r\n"He would not speak to any one, but he shut himself up the whole of the\r\nnight in the chamber where hangs the portrait that bears so strong a\r\nresemblance to Sir Francis Varney, and there he remained till the\r\nmorning, when he emerged, and said briefly that he intended to leave the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n"He was in a most fearful state of nervousness, and my mother tells me\r\nthat he shook like one in an ague, and started at every little sound\r\nthat occurred in the house, and glared about him so wildly that it was\r\nhorrible to see him, or to sit in the same apartment with him.\r\n\r\n"She says that the whole morning passed on in this way till a letter\r\ncame to him, the contents of which appeared to throw him into a perfect\r\nconvulsion of terror, and he retired again to the room with the\r\nportrait, where he remained some hours, and then he emerged, looking\r\nlike a ghost, so dreadfully pale and haggard was he.\r\n\r\n"He walked into the garden here, and was seen to sit down in this\r\nsummer-house, and fix his eyes upon the window of that apartment."\r\n\r\nHenry paused for a few moments, and then he added,--\r\n\r\n"You will excuse me from entering upon any details of what next ensued\r\nin the melancholy history. My father here committed suicide. He was\r\nfound dying, and all I he words he spoke were, \'The money is hidden!\'\r\nDeath claimed his victim, and, with a convulsive spasm, he resigned his\r\nspirit, leaving what he had intended to say hidden in the oblivion of\r\nthe grave."\r\n\r\n"That was an odd affair," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"It was, indeed. We have all pondered deeply, and the result was, that,\r\nupon the whole, we were inclined to come to an opinion that the words he\r\nso uttered were but the result of the mental disturbance that at such a\r\nmoment might well be supposed to be ensuing in the mind, and that they\r\nrelated really to no foregone fact any more than some incoherent words\r\nuttered by a man in a dream might be supposed to do."\r\n\r\n"It may be so."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, "for one moment to attempt\r\nto dispute, Henry, the rationality of such an opinion as you have just\r\ngiven utterance to; but you forget that another circumstance occurred,\r\nwhich gave a colour to the words used by your father."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know to what you allude."\r\n\r\n"Be so good as to state it to the admiral."\r\n\r\n"I will. On the evening of that same day there came a man here, who, in\r\nseeming ignorance of what had occurred, although by that time it was\r\nwell known to all the neighbourhood, asked to see my father.\r\n\r\n"Upon being told that he was dead, he started back, either with well\r\nacted or with real surprise, and seemed to be immensely chagrined. He\r\nthen demanded to know if he had left any disposition of his property;\r\nbut he got no information, and departed muttering the most diabolical\r\noaths and curses that can be imagined. He mounted his horse, for he had\r\nridden to the Hall and his last words were, as I am told--\r\n\r\n"\'Where, in the name of all that\'s damnable, can he have put the\r\nmoney!\'"\r\n\r\n"And did you never find out who this man was?" asked the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"It is an odd affair."\r\n\r\n"It is," said Mr. Chillingworth, "and full of mystery. The public mind\r\nwas much taken up at the time with some other matters, or it would have\r\nmade the death of Mr. Bannerworth the subject of more prolific comment\r\nthan it did. As it was, however, a great deal was said upon the subject,\r\nand the whole comity was in a state of commotion for weeks afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry; "it so happened that about that very time a murder\r\nwas committed in the neighbourhood of London, which baffled all the\r\nexertions of the authorities to discover the perpetrators of. It was the\r\nmurder of Lord Lorne."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I remember," said the admiral; "the newspapers were full of it for\r\na long time."\r\n\r\n"They were; and so, as Mr. Chillingworth says, the more exciting\r\ninterest which that affair created drew off public attention, in a great\r\nmeasure, from my father\'s suicide, and we did not suffer so much from\r\npublic remark and from impertinent curiosity as might have been\r\nexpected."\r\n\r\n"And, in addition," said Mr. Chillingworth, and he changed colour a\r\nlittle as he spoke, "there was an execution shortly afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry, "there was."\r\n\r\n"The execution of a man named Angerstein," added Mr. Chillingworth, "for\r\na highway robbery, attended with the most brutal violence."\r\n\r\n"True; all the affairs of that period of time are strongly impressed\r\nupon my mind," said Henry; "but you do not seem well, Mr.\r\nChillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I am quite well--you are mistaken."\r\n\r\nBoth the admiral and Henry looked scrutinizingly at the doctor, who\r\ncertainly appeared to them to be labouring under some great mental\r\nexcitement, which he found it almost beyond his power to repress.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is, doctor," said the admiral; "I don\'t pretend, and\r\nnever did, to see further through a tar-barrel than my neighbours; but I\r\ncan see far enough to feel convinced that you have got something on your\r\nmind, and that it somehow concerns this affair."\r\n\r\n"Is it so?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I cannot if I would," said Mr. Chillingworth; "and I may with truth\r\nadd, that I would not, if I could, hide from you that I have something\r\non my mind connected with this affair; but let me assure you it would be\r\npremature of me to tell you of it."\r\n\r\n"Premature be d----d!" said the admiral; "out with it."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, dear sir; I am not now in a position to say what is passing\r\nthrough my mind."\r\n\r\n"Alter your position, then, and be blowed!" cried Jack Pringle, suddenly\r\nstepping forward, and giving the doctor such a push, that he nearly went\r\nthrough one of the sides of the summer-house.\r\n\r\n"Why, you scoundrel!" cried the admiral, "how came you here?"\r\n\r\n"On my legs," said Jack. "Do you think nobody wants to know nothing but\r\nyourself? I\'m as fond of a yarn as anybody."\r\n\r\n"But if you are," said Mr. Chillingworth, "you had no occasion to come\r\nagainst me as if you wanted to move a house."\r\n\r\n"You said as you wasn\'t in a position to say something as I wanted to\r\nhear, so I thought I\'d alter it for you."\r\n\r\n"Is this fellow," said the doctor, shaking his head, as he accosted the\r\nadmiral, "the most artful or stupid?"\r\n\r\n"A little of both," said Admiral Bell--"a little of both, doctor. He\'s a\r\ngreat fool and a great scamp."\r\n\r\n"The same to you," said Jack; "you\'re another. I shall hate you\r\npresently, if you go on making yourself so ridiculous. Now, mind, I\'ll\r\nonly give you a trial of another week or so, and if you don\'t be more\r\npurlite in your d--n language, I\'ll leave you."\r\n\r\nAway strolled Jack, with his hands in his pockets, towards the house,\r\nwhile the admiral was half choked with rage, and could only glare after\r\nhim, without the ability to say a word.\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances than the present one of trouble, and\r\ndifficulty; and deep anxiety, Henry Bannerworth must have laughed at\r\nthese singular little episodes between Jack and the admiral; but his\r\nmind was now by far too much harassed to permit him to do so.\r\n\r\n"Let him go, let him go, my dear sir," said Mr. Chillingworth to the\r\nadmiral, who showed some signs of an intention to pursue Jack; "he no\r\ndoubt has been drinking again."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll turn him off the first moment I catch him sober enough to\r\nunderstand me," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; do as you please; but now let me ask a favour of both of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"That you will leave Bannerworth Hall to me for a week."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"I hope to make some discoveries connected with it which shall well\r\nreward you for the trouble."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no trouble," said Henry; "and for myself, I have amply sufficient\r\nfaith, both in your judgment and in your friendship, doctor, to accede\r\nto any request which you may make to me."\r\n\r\n"And I," said the admiral. "Be it so--be it so. For one week, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--for one week. I hope, by the end of that time, to have achieved\r\nsomething worth the telling you of; and I promise you that, if I am at\r\nall disappointed in my expectation, that I will frankly and freely\r\ncommunicate to you all I know and all I suspect."\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s a bargain."\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s to be done at once?"\r\n\r\n"Why, nothing, but to take the greatest possible care that Bannerworth\r\nHall is not left another hour without some one in it; and in order that\r\nsuch should be the case, I have to request that you two will remain here\r\nuntil I go to the town, and make preparations for taking quiet\r\npossession of it myself, which I will do in the course of two hours, at\r\nmost."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be longer," said the admiral, "for I am so desperately hungry,\r\nthat I shall certainly begin to eat somebody, if you are."\r\n\r\n"Depend upon me."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Henry; "you may depend we will wait here until you\r\ncome back."\r\n\r\nThe doctor at once hurried from the garden, leaving Henry and the\r\nadmiral to amuse themselves as best they might, with conjectures as to\r\nwhat he was really about, until his return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MEETING IN THE RUIN AGAIN.--THE VAMPYRE\'S ATTACK UPON THE\r\nCONSTABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary that we return once more to that mysterious ruin, in\r\nthe intricacies of which Varney, when pursued by the mob, had succeeded\r\nin finding a refuge which defied all the exertions which were made for\r\nhis discovery. Our readers must be well aware, that, connected with that\r\nruin, are some secrets of great importance to our story; and we will\r\nnow, at the solemn hour of midnight, take another glance at what is\r\ndoing within its recesses.\r\n\r\nAt that solemn hour it is not probable that any one would seek that\r\ngloomy place from choice. Some lover of the picturesque certainly might\r\nvisit it; but such was not the inciting cause of the pilgrimage with\r\nthose who were soon to stand within its gloomy precincts.\r\n\r\nOther motives dictated their presence in that spot--motives of rapine;\r\nperadventure of murder itself.\r\n\r\nAs the neighbouring clocks sounded the hour of twelve, and the faint\r\nstrokes were borne gently on the wind to that isolated ruin, there might\r\nhave been seen a tall man standing by the porch of what had once been a\r\nlarge doorway to some portion of the ruin.\r\n\r\nHis form was enveloped in a large cloak, which was of such ample\r\nmaterial that he seemed well able to wrap it several times around him,\r\nand then leave a considerable portion of it floating idly in the gentle\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nHe stood as still, as calm, and as motionless as a statue, for a\r\nconsiderable time, before any degree of impatience began to show itself.\r\n\r\nThen he took from his pocket a large antique watch, the white face of\r\nwhich just enabled him to see what the time was, and, in a voice which\r\nhad in it some amount of petulance and anger, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Not come yet, and nearly half an hour beyond the time! What can have\r\ndetained him? This is, indeed, trifling with the most important moments\r\nof a man\'s existence."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, he heard, from some distance off, the sound of a\r\nshort, quick footstep. He bent forwards to listen, and then, in a tone\r\nof satisfaction, he said,--\r\n\r\n"He comes--he comes!"\r\n\r\nBut he who thus waited for some confederate among these dim and old grey\r\nruins, advanced not a step to meet him. On the contrary, such seemed the\r\namount of cold-blooded caution which he possessed, that the nearer the\r\nman--who was evidently advancing--got to the place, the further back did\r\nhe who had preceded him shrink into the shadow of the dim and crumbling\r\nwalls, which had, for some years now past, seemed to bend to the passing\r\nblast, and to be on the point of yielding to the destroying hand of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, surely he needed not have been so cautious. Who was likely, at\r\nsuch an hour as that, to come to the ruins, but one who sought it by\r\nappointment?\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, the manner of the advancing man should have been quite\r\nsufficient to convince him who waited, that so much caution was\r\nunnecessary; but it was a part and parcel of his nature.\r\n\r\nAbout three minutes more sufficed to bring the second man to the ruin,\r\nand he, at once, and fearlessly, plunged into its recesses.\r\n\r\n"Who comes?" said the first man, in a deep, hollow voice.\r\n\r\n"He whom you expect," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Good," he said, and at once he now emerged from his hiding-place, and\r\nthey stood together in the nearly total darkness with which the place\r\nwas enshrouded; for the night was a cloudy one, and there appeared not a\r\nstar in the heavens, to shed its faint light upon the scene below.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they were both silent, for he who had last arrived had\r\nevidently made great exertions to reach the spot, and was breathing\r\nlaboriously, while he who was there first appeared, from some natural\r\ntaciturnity of character, to decline opening the conversation.\r\n\r\nAt length the second comer spoke, saying,--\r\n\r\n"I have made some exertion to get here to my time, and yet I am beyond\r\nit, as you are no doubt aware."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, such would not have been the case; but yet, I stayed to bring you\r\nsome news of importance."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"It is so. This place, which we have, now for some time had as a quiet\r\nand perfectly eligible one of meeting, is about to be invaded by one of\r\nthose restless, troublesome spirits, who are never happy but when they\r\nare contriving something to the annoyance of others who do not interfere\r\nwith them."\r\n\r\n"Explain yourself more fully."\r\n\r\n"I will. At a tavern in the town, there has happened some strange scenes\r\nof violence, in consequence of the general excitement into which the\r\ncommon people have been thrown upon the dreadful subject of vampyres."\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"The consequence is, that numerous arrests have taken place, and the\r\nplaces of confinement for offenders against the laws are now full of\r\nthose whose heated and angry imaginations have induced them to take\r\nviolent steps to discover the reality or the falsehood of rumours which\r\nso much affected them, their wives, and their families, that they feared\r\nto lie down to their night\'s repose."\r\n\r\nThe other laughed a short, hollow, restless sort of laugh, which had not\r\none particle of real mirth in it.\r\n\r\n"Go on--go on," he said. "What did they do?"\r\n\r\n"Immense excesses have been committed; but what made me, first of all,\r\nstay beyond my time, was that I overheard a man declare his intentions\r\nthis night, from twelve till the morning, and for some nights to come,\r\nto hold watch and ward for the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He did but stay, at the earnest solicitation of his comrades, to\r\ntake yet another glass, ere he came upon his expedition."\r\n\r\n"He must be met. The idiot! what business is it of his?"\r\n\r\n"There are always people who will make everything their business,\r\nwhether it be so or not."\r\n\r\n"There are. Let us retire further into the recesses of the ruin, and\r\nthere consider as well what is to be done regarding more important\r\naffairs, as with this rash intruder here."\r\n\r\nThey both walked for some twenty paces, or so, right into the ruin, and\r\nthen he who had been there first, said, suddenly, to his companion,--\r\n\r\n"I am annoyed, although the feeling reaches no further than annoyance,\r\nfor I have a natural love of mischief, to think that my reputation has\r\nspread so widely, and made so much noise."\r\n\r\n"Your reputation as a vampyre, Sir Francis Varney, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but there is no occasion for you to utter my name aloud, even here\r\nwhere we are alone together."\r\n\r\n"It came out unawares."\r\n\r\n"Unawares! Can it be possible that you have so little command over\r\nyourself as to allow a name to come from your lips unawares?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I am surprised."\r\n\r\n"Well, it cannot be helped. What do you now propose to do?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, you are my privy councillor. Have you no deep-laid, artful project\r\nin hand? Can you not plan and arrange something which may yet have the\r\neffect of accomplishing what at first seemed so very simple, but which\r\nhas, from one unfortunate circumstance and another, become full of\r\ndifficulty and pregnant with all sorts of dangers?"\r\n\r\n"I must confess I have no plan."\r\n\r\n"I listen with astonishment."\r\n\r\n"Nay, now, you are jesting."\r\n\r\n"When did you ever hear of me jesting?"\r\n\r\n"Not often, I admit. But you have a fertile genius, and I have always,\r\nmyself, found it easier to be the executive than to plan an elaborate\r\ncourse of action for others."\r\n\r\n"Then you throw it all on me?"\r\n\r\n"I throw a weight, naturally enough, upon the shoulders which I think\r\nthe best adapted to sustain it."\r\n\r\n"Be it so, then--be it so."\r\n\r\n"You are, I presume, from what you say, provided with a scheme of action\r\nwhich shall present better hopes of success, at less risk, I hope. Look\r\nwhat great danger we have already passed through."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have."\r\n\r\n"I pray you avoid that in the next campaign."\r\n\r\n"It is not the danger that annoys and troubles me, but it is that,\r\nnotwithstanding it, the object is as far off as ever from being\r\nattained."\r\n\r\n"And not only so, but, as is invariably the case under such\r\ncircumstances, we have made it more difficult of execution because we\r\nhave put those upon their guard thoroughly who are the most likely to\r\noppose us."\r\n\r\n"We have--we have."\r\n\r\n"And placed the probability of success afar off indeed."\r\n\r\n"And yet I have set my life upon the cast, and I will stand the hazard.\r\nI tell you I will accomplish this object, or I will perish in the\r\nattempt."\r\n\r\n"You are too enthusiastic."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. Nothing has been ever done, the execution of which was\r\ndifficult, without enthusiasm. I will do what I intend, or Bannerworth\r\nHall shall become a heap of ruins, where fire shall do its worst work of\r\ndevastation, and I will myself find a grave in the midst."\r\n\r\n"Well, I quarrel with no man for chalking out the course he intends to\r\npursue; but what do you mean to do with the prisoner below here?"\r\n\r\n"Kill him."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I say kill him. Do you not understand me?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"When everything else is secured, and when the whole of that which I so\r\nmuch court, and which I will have, is in my possession, I will take his\r\nlife, or you shall. Ay, you are just the man for such a deed. A\r\nsmooth-faced, specious sort of roan are you, and you like not danger.\r\nThere will be none in taking the life of a man who is chained to the\r\nfloor of a dungeon."\r\n\r\n"I know not why," said the other, "you take a pleasure on this\r\nparticular night, of all others, in saying all you can which you think\r\nwill be offensive to me."\r\n\r\n"Now, how you wrong me. This is the reward of confidence."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want such confidence."\r\n\r\n"Why, you surely don\'t want me to flatter you."\r\n\r\n"No; but--"\r\n\r\n"Psha! Hark you. That admiral is the great stumbling-block in my way. I\r\nshould ere this have had undisturbed possession of Bannerworth Hall but\r\nfor him. He must be got out of the way somehow."\r\n\r\n"A short time will tire him out of watching. He is one of those men of\r\nimpulse who soon become wearied of inaction."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and then the Bannerworths return to the Hall."\r\n\r\n"It may be so."\r\n\r\n"I am certain of it. We have been out-generalled in this matter,\r\nalthough I grant we did all that men could do to give us success."\r\n\r\n"In what way would you get rid of this troublesome admiral?"\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know. A letter from his nephew might, if well put together,\r\nget him to London."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it. I hate him mortally. He has offended me more than once most\r\ngrievously."\r\n\r\n"I know it. He saw through you."\r\n\r\n"I do not give him so much credit. He is a suspicious man, and a vain\r\nand a jealous one."\r\n\r\n"And yet he saw through you. Now, listen to me. You are completely at\r\nfault, and have no plan of operations whatever in your mind. What I want\r\nyou to do is, to disappear from the neighbourhood for a time, and so\r\nwill I. As for our prisoner here below, I cannot see what else can be\r\ndone with him than--than--"\r\n\r\n"Than what? Do you hesitate?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Then what is it you were about to say?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot but feel that all we have done hitherto, as regards this young\r\nprisoner of ours, has failed. He has, with a determined obstinacy, set\r\nat naught, as well you know, all threats."\r\n\r\n"He has."\r\n\r\n"He has refused to do one act which could in any way aid me in my\r\nobjects. In fact, from the first to the last, he has been nothing but an\r\nexpense and an encumbrance to us both."\r\n\r\n"All that is strictly true."\r\n\r\n"And yet, although you, as well as I, know of a marvellously ready way\r\nof getting rid of such encumbrances, I must own, that I shrink with more\r\nthan a feeling of reluctance from the murder of the youth."\r\n\r\n"You contemplated it then?" asked the other.\r\n\r\n"No; I cannot be said to have contemplated it. That is not the proper\r\nsort of expression to use."\r\n\r\n"What is then?"\r\n\r\n"To contemplate a deed seems to me to have some close connexion to the\r\nwish to do it."\r\n\r\n"And you have no such wish?"\r\n\r\n"I have no such wish, and what is more I will not do it."\r\n\r\n"Then that is sufficient; and the only question that remains for you to\r\nconfide, is, what you will do. It is far easier in all enterprises to\r\ndecide upon what we will not do, than upon what we will. For my own part\r\nI must say that I can perceive no mode of extricating ourselves from\r\nthis involvement with anything like safety."\r\n\r\n"Then it must be done with something like danger."\r\n\r\n"As you please."\r\n\r\n"You say so, and your words bear a clear enough signification; but from\r\nyour tone I can guess how much you are dissatisfied with the aspect of\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\n"Dissatisfied!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I say, dissatisfied. Be frank, and own that which it is in vain to\r\nconceal from me. I know you too well; arch hypocrite as you are, and\r\nfully capable of easily deceiving many, you cannot deceive me."\r\n\r\n"I really cannot understand you."\r\n\r\n"Then I will take care that you shall."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Listen. I will not have the life of Charles Holland taken."\r\n\r\n"Who wishes to take it?"\r\n\r\n"You."\r\n\r\n"There, indeed, you wrong me. Unless you yourself thought that such an\r\nact was imperatively called for by the state of affairs, do you think\r\nthat I would needlessly bring down upon my head the odium as well as the\r\ndanger of such a deed? No, no. Let him live, if you are willing; he may\r\nlive a thousand years for all I care."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well. I am, mark me, not only willing, but I am determined that he\r\nshall live so far as we are concerned. I can respect the courage that,\r\neven when he considered that his life was at stake, enabled him to say\r\nno to a proposal which was cowardly and dishonourable, although it went\r\nfar to the defeat of my own plans and has involved me in much trouble."\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy I hear a footstep."\r\n\r\n"Indeed; that were a novelty in such a place as this."\r\n\r\n"And yet not more than I expected. Have you forgotten what I told you\r\nwhen I reached here to-night after the appointed hour?"\r\n\r\n"Truly; I had for the moment. Do you think then that the footstep which\r\nnow meets our ears, is that of the adventurer who boasted that he could\r\nkeep watch for the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"In faith do I. What is to be done with such a meddling fool?"\r\n\r\n"He ought certainly to be taught not to be so fond of interfering with\r\nother people\'s affairs."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Perchance the lesson will not be wholly thrown away upon others. It may\r\nbe worth while to take some trouble with this poor valiant fellow, and\r\nlet him spread his news so as to stop any one else from being equally\r\nventurous and troublesome."\r\n\r\n"A good thought."\r\n\r\n"Shall it be done?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; if you will arrange that which shall accomplish such a result."\r\n\r\n"Be it so. The moon rises soon."\r\n\r\n"It does."\r\n\r\n"Ah, already I fancy I see a brightening of the air as if the mellow\r\nradiance of the queen of night were already quietly diffusing itself\r\nthroughout the realms of space. Come further within the ruins."\r\n\r\nThey both walked further among the crumbling walls and fragments of\r\ncolumns with which the place abounded. As they did so they paused now\r\nand then to listen, and more than once they both heard plainly the sound\r\nof certain footsteps immediately outside the once handsome and spacious\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nVarney, the vampyre, who had been holding this conversation with no\r\nother than Marchdale, smiled as he, in a whispered voice, told the\r\nlatter what to do in order to frighten away from the place the foolhardy\r\nman who thought that, by himself, he should be able to accomplish\r\nanything against the vampyre.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a hair-brained expedition, for whether Sir Francis\r\nVarney was really so awful and preternatural a being as so many\r\nconcurrent circumstances would seem to proclaim, or not, he was not a\r\nlikely being to allow himself to be conquered by anyone individual, let\r\nhis powers or his courage be what they might.\r\n\r\nWhat induced this man to become so ventursome we shall now proceed to\r\nrelate, as well as what kind of reception he got in the old ruins,\r\nwhich, since the mysterious disappearance of Sir Francis Varney within\r\ntheir recesses, had possessed so increased a share of interest and\r\nattracted so much popular attention and speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GUESTS AT THE INN, AND THE STORY OF THE DEAD UNCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs had been truly stated by Mr. Marchdale, who now stands out in his\r\ntrue colours to the reader as the confidant and abettor of Sir Francis\r\nVarney, there had assembled on that evening a curious and a gossipping\r\nparty at the inn where such dreadful and such riotous proceedings had\r\ntaken place, which, in their proper place, we have already duly and at\r\nlength recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was not very likely that, on that evening, or for many and many an\r\nevening to come, the conversation in the parlour of the inn would be\r\nupon any other subject than that of the vampyre.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the strange, mysterious, and horrible circumstances which had\r\noccurred, bade fair to be gossipping stock in trade for many a year.\r\n\r\nNever before had a subject presenting so many curious features arisen.\r\nNever, within the memory of that personage who is supposed to know\r\neverything, had there occurred any circumstance in the county, or set of\r\ncircumstances, which afforded such abundant scope for conjecture and\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nEverybody might have his individual opinion, and be just as likely to be\r\nright as his neighbours; and the beauty of the affair was, that such was\r\nthe interest of the subject itself, that there was sure to be a kind of\r\nreflected interest with every surmise that at all bore upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn this particular night, when Marchdale was prowling about, gathering\r\nwhat news he could, in order that he might carry it to the vampyre, a\r\nmore than usually strong muster of the gossips of the town took place.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all of any note in the talking way were there, with the\r\nexception of one, and he was in the county gaol, being one of the\r\nprisoners apprehended by the military when they made the successful\r\nattack upon the lumber-room of the inn, after the dreadful desecration\r\nof the dead which had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the inn was likely to make a good thing of it, for\r\ntalking makes people thirsty; and he began to consider that a vampyre\r\nabout once a-year would be no bad thing for the Blue Lion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s shocking," said one of the guests; "it\'s shocking to think of.\r\nOnly last night, I am quite sure I had such a fright that it added at\r\nleast ten years to my age."\r\n\r\n"A fright!" said several.\r\n\r\n"I believe I speak English--I said a fright."\r\n\r\n"Well, but had it anything to do with the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"Everything."\r\n\r\n"Oh! do tell us; do tell us all about it. How was it? Did he come to\r\nyou? Go on. Well, well."\r\n\r\nThe first speaker became immediately a very important personage in the\r\nroom; and, when he saw that, he became at once a very important\r\npersonage in his own eyes likewise; and, before he would speak another\r\nword, he filled a fresh pipe, and ordered another mug of ale.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use trying to hurry him," said one.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "it isn\'t. I\'ll tell you in good time what a dreadful\r\ncircumstance has made me sixty-three to-day, when I was only fifty-three\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"Was it very dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"Rather. You wouldn\'t have survived it at all."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"No. Now listen. I went to bed at a quarter after eleven, as usual. I\r\ndidn\'t notice anything particular in the room."\r\n\r\n"Did you peep under the bed?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t. Well, as I was a-saying, to bed I went, and I didn\'t\r\nfasten the door; because, being a very sound sleeper, in case there was\r\na fire, I shouldn\'t hear a word of it if I did."\r\n\r\n"No," said another. "I recollect once--"\r\n\r\n"Be so good as allow me to finish what I know, before you begin to\r\nrecollect anything, if you please. As I was saying, I didn\'t lock the\r\ndoor, but I went to bed. Somehow or another, I did not feel at all\r\ncomfortable, and I tossed about, first on one side, and then on the\r\nother; but it was all in vain; I only got, every moment, more and more\r\nfidgetty."\r\n\r\n"And did you think of the vampyre?" said one of the listeners.\r\n\r\n"I thought of nothing else till I heard my clock, which is on the\r\nlanding of the stairs above my bed-room, begin to strike twelve."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I like to hear a clock sound in the night," said one; "it puts one\r\nin mind of the rest of the world, and lets one know one isn\'t all\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"Very good. The striking of the clock I should not at all have objected\r\nto; but it was what followed that did the business."\r\n\r\n"What, what?"\r\n\r\n"Fair and softly; fair and softly. Just hand me a light, Mr. Sprigs, if\r\nyou please. I\'ll tell you all, gentlemen, in a moment or two."\r\n\r\nWith the most provoking deliberation, the speaker re-lit his pipe, which\r\nhad gone out while he was talking, and then, after a few whiffs, to\r\nassure himself that its contents had thoroughly ignited, he resumed,--\r\n\r\n"No sooner had the last sound of it died away, than I heard something on\r\nthe stairs."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"It was as if some man had given his foot a hard blow against one of the\r\nstairs; and he would have needed to have had a heavy boot on to do it. I\r\nstarted up in bed and listened, as you may well suppose, not in the most\r\ntranquil state of mind, and then I heard an odd, gnawing sort of noise,\r\nand then another dab upon one of the stairs."\r\n\r\n"How dreadful!"\r\n\r\n"It was. What to do I knew not, or what to think, except that the\r\nvampyre had, by some means, got in at the attic window, and was coming\r\ndown stairs to my room. That seemed the most likely. Then there was\r\nanother groan, and then another heavy step; and, as they were evidently\r\ncoming towards my door, I felt accordingly, and got out of bed, not\r\nknowing hardly whether I was on my head or my heels, to try and lock my\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that was all very well, if I could have done it; but a man in such\r\na state of mind as I was in is not a very sharp hand at doing anything.\r\nI shook from head to foot. The room was very dark, and I couldn\'t, for a\r\nmoment or two, collect my senses sufficient really to know which way the\r\ndoor lay."\r\n\r\n"What a situation!"\r\n\r\n"It was. Dab, dab, dab, came these horrid footsteps, and there was I\r\ngroping about the room in an agony. I heard them coming nearer and\r\nnearer to my door. Another moment, and they must have reached it, when\r\nmy hand struck against the lock."\r\n\r\n"What an escape!"\r\n\r\n"No, it was not."\r\n\r\n"No?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. The key was on the outside, and you may well guess I was\r\nnot over and above disposed to open the door to get at it."\r\n\r\n"No, no."\r\n\r\n"I felt regularly bewildered, I can tell you; it seemed to me as if the\r\nvery devil himself was coming down stairs hopping all the way upon one\r\nleg."\r\n\r\n"How terrific!"\r\n\r\n"I felt my senses almost leaving me; but I did what I could to hold the\r\ndoor shut just as I heard the strange step come from the last stair on\r\nto the landing. Then there was a horrid sound, and some one began trying\r\nthe lock of my door."\r\n\r\n"What a moment!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can tell you it was a moment. Such a moment as I don\'t wish to\r\ngo through again. I held the door as close as I could, and did not\r\nspeak. I tried to cry out help and murder, but I could not; my tongue\r\nstuck to the roof of my mouth, and my strength was fast failing me."\r\n\r\n"Horrid, horrid!"\r\n\r\n"Take a drop of ale."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Well, I don\'t think this went on above two or three minutes,\r\nand all the while some one tried might and main to push open the door.\r\nMy strength left me all at once; I had only time to stagger back a step\r\nor two, and then, as the door opened, I fainted away."\r\n\r\n"Well, well!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you wouldn\'t have said well, if you had been there, I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"No; but what become of you. What happened next? How did it end? What\r\nwas it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, what exactly happened next after I fainted I cannot tell you; but\r\nthe first thing I saw when I recovered was a candle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"And then a crowd of people."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah!"\r\n\r\n"And then Dr. Web."\r\n\r\n"Gracious!"\r\n\r\n"And. Mrs. Bulk, my housekeeper. I was in my own bed, and when I opened\r\nmy eyes I heard Dr. Webb say,--\r\n\r\n"\'He will be better soon. Can no one form any idea of what it is all\r\nabout. Some sudden fright surely could alone have produced such an\r\neffect.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'The Lord have mercy upon me!\' said I.\r\n\r\n"Upon this everybody who had been called in got round the bed, and\r\nwanted to know what had happened; but I said not a word of it; but\r\nturning to Mrs. Bulk, I asked her how it was she found out I had\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\n"\'Why, sir,\' says she, \'I was coming up to bed as softly as I could,\r\nbecause I knew you had gone to rest some time before. The clock was\r\nstriking twelve, and as I went past it some of my clothes, I suppose,\r\ncaught the large weight, but it was knocked off, and down the stairs it\r\nrolled, going with such a lump from one to the other, and I couldn\'t\r\ncatch it because it rolled so fast, that I made sure you would be\r\nawakened; so I came down to tell you what it was, and it was some time\r\nbefore I could get your room door open, and when I did I found you out\r\nof bed and insensible.\'"\r\n\r\nThere was a general look of disappointment when this explanation was\r\ngiven, and one said,--\r\n\r\n"Then it was not the vampire?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"And, after all, only a clock weight."\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell us that at first?"\r\n\r\n"Because that would have spoilt the story."\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur of discontent, and, after a few moments one\r\nman said, with some vivacity,--\r\n\r\n"Well, although our friend\'s vampyre has turned out, after all, to be\r\nnothing but a confounded clock-weight, there\'s no disputing the fact\r\nabout Sir Francis Varney being a vampyre, and not a clock-weight."\r\n\r\n"Very true--very true."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s to be done to rid the town of such a man?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t call him a man."\r\n\r\n"Well, a monster."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s more like. I tell you what, sir, if you had got a light,\r\nwhen you first heard the noise in your room, and gone out to see what it\r\nwas, you would have spared yourself much fright."\r\n\r\n"Ah, no doubt; it\'s always easy afterwards to say, if you had done this,\r\nand if you had done the other, so and so would have been the effect; but\r\nthere is something about the hour of midnight that makes men tremble."\r\n\r\n"Well," said one, who had not yet spoken, "I don\'t see why twelve at\r\nnight should be a whit more disagreeable than twelve at day."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not I."\r\n\r\n"Now, for instance, many a party of pleasure goes to that old ruin where\r\nSir Francis Varney so unaccountably disappeared in broad daylight. But\r\nis there any one here who would go to it alone, and at midnight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"I would."\r\n\r\n"What! and after what has happened as regards the vampyre in connection\r\nwith it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I would."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you twenty shilling you won\'t."\r\n\r\n"And I--and I," cried several.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen," said the man, who certainly shewed no signs of fear,\r\n"I will go, and not only will I go and take all your bets, but, if I do\r\nmeet the vampyre, then I\'ll do my best to take him prisoner."\r\n\r\n"And when will you go?"\r\n\r\n"To-night," he cried, and he sprang to his feet; "hark ye all, I don\'t\r\nbelieve one word about vampyres. I\'ll go at once; it\'s getting late, and\r\nlet any one of you, in order that you may be convinced I have been to\r\nthe place, give me any article, which I will hide among the ruins; and\r\ntell you where to find it to-morrow in broad daylight."\r\n\r\n"Well," said one, "that\'s fair, Tom Eccles. Here\'s a handkerchief of\r\nmine; I should know it again among a hundred others."\r\n\r\n"Agreed; I\'ll leave it in the ruins."\r\n\r\nThe wagers were fairly agreed upon; several handkerchiefs were handed to\r\nTom Eccles; and at eleven o\'clock he fairly started, through the murky\r\ndarkness of the night, to the old ruin where Sir Francis Varney and\r\nMarchdale were holding their most unholy conference.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to talk and to accept wagers in the snug parlour of an\r\ninn, and another to go alone across a tract of country wrapped in the\r\nprofound stillness of night to an ancient ruin which, in addition to the\r\nnatural gloom which might well be supposed to surround it, has\r\nsuperadded associations which are anything but of a pleasant character.\r\n\r\nTom Eccles, as he was named, was one of those individuals who act\r\ngreatly from impulse. He was certainly not a coward, and, perhaps,\r\nreally as free from superstition as most persons, but he was human, and\r\nconsequently he had nerves, and he had likewise an imagination.\r\n\r\nHe went to his house first before he started on his errand to the ruins.\r\nIt was to get a horse-pistol which he had, and which he duly loaded and\r\nplaced in his pocket. Then he wrapped himself up in a great-coat, and\r\nwith the air of a man quite determined upon something desperate he left\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nThe guests at the inn looked after him as he walked from the door of\r\nthat friendly establishment, and some of them, as they saw his resolved\r\naspect, began to quake for the amount of the wagers they had laid upon\r\nhis non-success.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was resolved among them, that they would stay until\r\nhalf-past twelve, in the expectation of his return, before they\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nTo while away the time, he who had been so facetious about his story of\r\nthe clock-weight, volunteered to tell what happened to a friend of his\r\nwho went to take possession of some family property which he became\r\npossessed of as heir-at-law to an uncle who had died without a will,\r\nhaving an illegitimate family unprovided for in every shape.\r\n\r\n"Ah! nobody cares for other people\'s illegitimate children, and, if\r\ntheir parents don\'t provide for them, why, the workhouse is open for\r\nthem, just as if they were something different from other people."\r\n\r\n"So they are; if their parents don\'t take care of them, and provide for\r\nthem, nobody else will, as you say, neighbour, except when they have a\r\nFitz put to their name, which tells you they are royal bastards, and of\r\ncourse unlike anybody else\'s."\r\n\r\n"But go on--let\'s know all about it; we sha\'n\'t hear what he has got to\r\nsay at all, at this rate."\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying, or about to say, the nephew, as soon as he heard\r\nhis uncle was dead, comes and claps his seal upon everything in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"But, could he do so?" inquired one of the guests.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what was to hinder him," replied a third. "He could do so,\r\ncertainly."\r\n\r\n"But there was a son, and, as I take it, a son\'s nearer than a nephew\r\nany day."\r\n\r\n"But the son is illegitimate."\r\n\r\n"Legitimate, or illegitimate, a son\'s a son; don\'t bother me about\r\ndistinction of that sort; why, now, there was old Weatherbit--"\r\n\r\n"Order, order."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hear the tale."\r\n\r\n"Very good, gentlemen, I\'ll go on, if I ain\'t to be interrupted; but\r\nI\'ll say this, that an illegitimate son is no son, in the eyes of the\r\nlaw; or at most he\'s an accident quite, and ain\'t what he is, and so\r\ncan\'t inherit."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s what I call making matters plain," said one of the guests,\r\nwho took his pipe from his mouth to make room for the remark; "now that\r\nis what I likes."\r\n\r\n"Well, as I have proved then," resumed the speaker, "the nephew was the\r\nheir, and into the house he would come. A fine affair it was too--the\r\nillegitimates looking the colour of sloes; but he knew the law, and\r\nwould have it put in force."\r\n\r\n"Law\'s law, you know."\r\n\r\n"Uncommonly true that; and the nephew stuck to it like a cobbler to his\r\nlast--he said they should go out, and they did go out; and, say what\r\nthey would about their natural claims, he would not listen to them, but\r\nbundled them out and out in a pretty short space of time."\r\n\r\n"It was trying to them, mind you, to leave the house they had been born\r\nin with very different expectations to those which now appeared to be\r\ntheir fate. Poor things, they looked ruefully enough, and well they\r\nmight, for there was a wide world for them, and no prospect of a warm\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying, he had them all out and the house clear to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, "I have an open field and no favour. I don\'t care for\r\nno--Eh! what?"\r\n\r\n"There was a sudden knocking, he thought, the door, and went and opened\r\nit, but nothing was to be seen.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I see--somebody next door; and if it wasn\'t, it don\'t matter.\r\nThere\'s nobody here. I\'m alone, and there\'s plenty of valuables in the\r\nhouse. That is what I call very good company. I wouldn\'t wish for\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\nHe turned about, looked over room after room, and satisfied himself that\r\nhe was alone--that the house was empty.\r\n\r\nAt every room he entered he paused to think over the value--what it was\r\nworth, and that he was a very fortunate man in having dropped into such\r\na good thing.\r\n\r\n"Ah! there\'s the old boy\'s secretary, too--his bureau--there\'ll be\r\nsomething in that that will amuse me mightily; but I don\'t think I shall\r\nsit up late. He was a rum old man, to say the least of it--a very odd\r\nsort of man."\r\n\r\nWith that he gave himself a shrug, as if some very uncomfortable feeling\r\nhad come over him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go to bed early, and get some sleep, and then in daylight I can\r\nlook after these papers. They won\'t be less interesting in the morning\r\nthan they are now."\r\n\r\nThere had been some rum stories about the old man, and now the nephew\r\nseemed to think he might have let the family sleep on the premises for\r\nthat night; yes, at that moment he could have found it in his heart to\r\nhave paid for all the expense of their keep, had it been possible to\r\nhave had them back to remain the night.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn\'t possible, for they would not have done it, but sooner\r\nhave remained in the streets all night than stay there all night, like\r\nso many house-dogs, employed by one who stepped in between them and\r\ntheir father\'s goods, which were their inheritance, but for one trifling\r\ncircumstance--a mere ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe night came on, and he had lights. True it was he had not been down\r\nstairs, only just to have a look. He could not tell what sort of a place\r\nit was; there were a good many odd sort of passages, that seemed to end\r\nnowhere, and others that did.\r\n\r\nThere were large doors; but they were all locked, and he had the keys;\r\nso he didn\'t mind, but secured all places that were not fastened.\r\n\r\nHe then went up stairs again, and sat down in the room where the bureau\r\nwas placed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound," said one of the guests, "he was in a bit of a stew,\r\nnotwithstanding all his brag."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t believe," said another, "that anything done that is\r\ndangerous, or supposed to be dangerous, by the bravest man, is any way\r\nwholly without some uncomfortable feelings. They may not be strong\r\nenough to prevent the thing proposed to be done from being done, but\r\nthey give a disagreeable sensation to the skin."\r\n\r\n"You have felt it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha!"\r\n\r\n"Why, at that time I slept in the churchyard for a wager, I must say I\r\nfelt cold all over, as if my skin was walking about me in an\r\nuncomfortable manner."\r\n\r\n"But you won your wager?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"And of course you slept there?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I did."\r\n\r\n"And met with nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, save a few bumps against the gravestones."\r\n\r\n"Those were hard knocks, I should say."\r\n\r\n"They were, I assure you; but I lay there, and slept there, and won my\r\nwager."\r\n\r\n"Would you do it again?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because of the rheumatism."\r\n\r\n"You caught that?"\r\n\r\n"I did; I would give ten times my wager to get rid of them. I have them\r\nvery badly."\r\n\r\n"Come, order, order--the tale; let\'s hear the end of that, since it has\r\nbegun."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart. Come, neighbour."\r\n\r\n"Well, as I said, he was fidgetty; but yet he was not a man to be very\r\neasily frightened or overcome, for he was stout and bold.\r\n\r\n"When he shut himself up in the room, he took out a bottle of some good\r\nwine, and helped himself to drink; it was good old wine, and he soon\r\nfelt himself warmed and, comforted. He could have faced the enemy.\r\n\r\n"If one bottle produces such an effect," he muttered, "what will two\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\nThis was a question that could only be solved by trying it, and this he\r\nproceeded to do.\r\n\r\nBut first he drew a brace of long barrelled pistols from his coat\r\npocket, and taking a powder-flask and bullets from his pocket also, he\r\nloaded them very carefully.\r\n\r\n"There," said he, "are my bull-dogs; and rare watch-dogs they are. They\r\nnever bark but they bite. Now, if anybody does come, it will be all up\r\nwith them. Tricks upon travellers ain\'t a safe game when I have these;\r\nand now for the other bottle."\r\n\r\nHe drew the other bottle, and thought, if anything, it was better than\r\nthe first. He drank it rather quick, to be sure, and then he began to\r\nfeel sleepy and tired.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall go to bed," he said; "that is, if I can find my way\r\nthere, for it does seem to me as if the door was travelling. Never mind,\r\nit will make a call here again presently, and then I\'ll get through."\r\n\r\nSo saying he arose. Taking the candle in his hand, he walked with a\r\nbetter step than might have been expected under the circumstance. True\r\nit was the candle wagged to and fro, and his shadow danced upon the\r\nwall; but still, when he got to the bed, he secured his door, put the\r\nlight in a safe place, threw himself down, and was fast asleep in a few\r\nmoments, or rather he fell into a doze instantaneously.\r\n\r\nHow long he remained in this state he knew not, but he was suddenly\r\nawakened by a loud bang, as though something heavy and flat had fallen\r\nupon the floor--such, for instance, as a door, or anything of that sort.\r\nHe jumped up, rubbed his eyes, and could even then hear the\r\nreverberations through the house.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" he muttered; "what is that?"\r\n\r\nHe listened, and thought he could hear something moving down stairs, and\r\nfor a moment he was seized with an ague fit; but recollecting, I\r\nsuppose, that there were some valuables down stairs that were worth\r\nfighting for, he carefully extinguished the light that still burned, and\r\nsoftly crept down stairs.\r\n\r\nWhen he got down stairs he thought he could hear some one scramble up\r\nthe kitchen stairs, and then into the room where the bureau was.\r\nListening for a moment to ascertain if there were more than one, and\r\nthen feeling convinced there was not, he followed into the parlour, when\r\nhe heard the cabinet open by a key.\r\n\r\nThis was a new miracle, and one he could not understand; and then he\r\nheard the papers begin to rattle and rustle; so, drawing out one of the\r\npistols, he cocked it, and walked in.\r\n\r\nThe figure instantly began to jump about; it was dressed in white--in\r\ngrave-clothes. He was terribly nervous, and shook, so he feared to fire\r\nthe pistol; but at length he did, and the report was followed by a fall\r\nand a loud groan.\r\n\r\nThis was very dreadful--very dreadful; but all was quiet, and he lit the\r\ncandle again, and approached the body to examine it, and ascertain if he\r\nknew who it was. A groan came from it. The bureau was open, and the\r\nfigure clutched firmly a will in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe figure was dressed in grave-clothes, and he started up when he saw\r\nthe form and features of his own uncle, the man who was dead, who\r\nsomehow or other had escaped his confinement, and found his way up,\r\nhere. He held his will firmly; and the nephew was so horrified and\r\nstunned, that he threw down the light, and rushed out of the room with a\r\nshout of terror, and never returned again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe narrator concluded, and one of the guests said,--\r\n\r\n"And do you really believe it?"--"No, no--to be sure not."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t?"--"Why should I? My friend was, out of all hand, one of the\r\ngreatest liars I ever came near; and why, therefore, should I believe\r\nhim? I don\'t, on my conscience, believe one word of it."\r\n\r\nIt was now half-past twelve, and, as Tom Eccles came not back, and the\r\nlandlord did not feel disposed to draw any more liquor, they left the\r\ninn, and retired to their separate houses in a great state of anxiety to\r\nknow the fate of their respective wagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE VAMPIRE IN THE MOONLIGHT.--THE FALSE FRIEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPart of the distance being accomplished towards the old ruins, Tom\r\nEccles began to feel that what he had undertaken was not altogether such\r\nchild\'s-play as he had at first imagined it to be. Somehow or another,\r\nwith a singular and uncomfortable sort of distinctness, there came\r\nacross his mind every story that he had remembered of the wild and the\r\nwonderful. All the long-since forgotten tales of superstition that in\r\nearly childhood he had learned, came now back upon him, suggesting to\r\nhis mind a thousand uncomfortable fancies of the strangest description.\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that when once a man, under such circumstances, got\r\ninto such a frame of mind, he would readily get out of it again, while\r\nhe continued surrounded by such scenes as had first called them into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, had he turned about, and faced the inn again instead of the\r\nold ruins he would soon have shaken off these "thick coming fancies;"\r\nbut such a result was no to be expected, so long as he kept on towards\r\nthe dismal place he had pledged himself to reach.\r\n\r\nAs he traversed meadow after meadow he began to ask himself some\r\nquestions which he found that he could not answer exactly in a\r\nconsolatory manner, under the present state of things.\r\n\r\nAmong these question was the very pertinent one of,--"It\'s no argument\r\nagainst vampyres, because I don\'t see the use of \'em--is it?" This he\r\nwas compelled to answer as he had put it; and when, in addition, he\r\nbegan to recollect that, without the shadow of a doubt, Sir Francis\r\nVarney the supposed vampyre, had been chased across the fields to that\r\nvery ruin whither he was bound, and had then and there disappeared, he\r\ncertainly found himself in decidedly uncomfortable and most unpromising\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "no. Hang it, I won\'t go back now, to be made the\r\nlaughing-stock of the whole town, which I should be. Come what may of\r\nit, I will go on as I have commenced; so I shall put on as stout a heart\r\nas I can."\r\n\r\nThen, having come to this resolve, he strove might and main to banish\r\nfrom his mind those disagreeable reminiscences that had been oppressing\r\nhim, to turn his attention to subjects of a different complexion.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of making this endeavour, which was rather futile,\r\nhe came within sight of the ruins. Then he slackened his pace a little,\r\ntelling himself, with a pardonable self-deceit, that it was common,\r\nordinary caution only, which induced him to do so, and nothing at all in\r\nthe shape of fear.\r\n\r\n"Time enough," he remarked, "to be afraid, when I see anything to be\r\nafraid of, which I don\'t see as yet. So, as all\'s right, I may as well\r\nput a good face upon the matter."\r\n\r\nHe tried to whistle a tune, but it turned out only a melancholy failure;\r\nso he gave that up in despair, and walked on until he got within a\r\nhundred yards, or thereabouts, of the old ruins.\r\n\r\nHe thus proceeded, and bending his ear close to the ground, he listened\r\nattentively for several minutes. Somehow, he fancied that a strange,\r\nmurmuring sound came to his ears; but he was not quite sure that it\r\nproceeded from the ruins, because it was just that sort of sound that\r\nmight come from a long way off, being mellowed by distance, although,\r\nperhaps, loud enough at its source.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," he whispered to himself, "it don\'t matter much, after all.\r\nGo I must, and hide the handkerchiefs somewhere, or else be laughed at,\r\nbesides losing my wages. The former I don\'t like, and the latter I\r\ncannot afford."\r\n\r\nThus clinching the matter by such knock-down arguments, he walked on\r\nuntil he was almost within the very shadow of the ruins, and, probably,\r\nit was at this juncture that his footsteps may have been heard by\r\nMarchdale and Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nThen he paused again; but all was profoundly still, and he began to\r\nthink that the strange sort of murmuring noise which he had heard must\r\nhave come from far off and not at all from any person or persons within\r\nthe ruins.\r\n\r\n"Let me see," he said to himself; "I have five handkerchiefs to hide\r\namong the old ruins somewhere, and the sooner I do so the better,\r\nbecause then I will get away; for, as regards staying here to watch,\r\nHeaven knows how long, for Sir Francis Varney, I don\'t intend to do it,\r\nupon second thoughts and second thoughts, they say, are generally best."\r\n\r\nWith the most careful footsteps now, as if he were treading upon some\r\nfragile substance, which he feared to injure, he advanced until he was\r\nfairly within the precincts of the ancient place, which now bore so ill\r\na reputation.\r\n\r\nHe then made to himself much the same remark that Sir Francis Varney had\r\nmade to Marchdale, with respect to the brightening up of the sky, in\r\nconsequence of its being near the time for the moon to rise from the\r\nhorizon, and he saw more clearly around him, although he could not find\r\nany good place to hide the handkerchiefs in.\r\n\r\n"I must and will," he said, "hide them securely; for it would, indeed,\r\nbe remarkably unpleasant, after coming here and winning my wages, to\r\nhave the proofs that I had done so taken away by some chance visitor to\r\nthe place."\r\n\r\nHe at length saw a tolerably large stone, which stood, in a slant\r\nposition, up against one of the walls. Its size attracted him. He\r\nthought, if his strength was sufficient to move it, that it would be a\r\ngood thing to do so, and to place the handkerchiefs beneath it; for, at\r\nall events, it was so heavy that it could not be kicked aside, and no\r\none, without some sort of motive to do so, beyond the mere love of\r\nlabour, would set about moving it from its position.\r\n\r\n"I may go further and fare worse," he said to himself; "so here shall\r\nall the handkerchiefs lie, to afford a proof that I have been here."\r\n\r\nHe packed them into a small compass, and then stooped to roll aside the\r\nheavy stone, when, at the moment, before he could apply his strength to\r\nthat purpose, he heard some one, in his immediate neighbourhood,\r\nsay,--"Hist!"\r\n\r\nThis was so sudden, and so utterly unexpected, that he not only ceased\r\nhis exertions to move the stone, but he nearly fell down in his\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Hist--hist!" said the voice again.\r\n\r\n"What--what," gasped Tom Eccles--"what are you?"--"Hush--hush--hush!"\r\n\r\nThe perspiration broke out upon his brow, and he leaned against the wall\r\nfor support, as he managed to say, faintly,--\r\n\r\n"Well, hush--what then?"--"Hist!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I hear you. Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Here at hand. Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"Tom Eccles. Who are you?"--"A friend. Have you seen anything?"\r\n\r\n"No; I wish I could. I should like to see you if I could."--"I\'m\r\ncoming."\r\n\r\nThere was a slow and cautious footstep, and Marchdale advanced to where\r\nTom Eccles was standing.\r\n\r\n"Come, now," said the latter, when he saw the dusky-looking form\r\nstalking towards him; "till I know you better, I\'ll be obliged to you to\r\nkeep off. I am well armed. Keep your distance, be you friend or foe."\r\n\r\n"Armed!" exclaimed Marchdale, and he at once paused.--"Yes, I am."\r\n\r\n"But I am a friend. I have no sort of objection frankly to tell you my\r\nerrand. I am a friend of the Bannerworth family, and have kept watch\r\nhere now for two nights, in the hopes of meeting with Varney, the\r\nvampyre."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you have: and pray what may your name be?"--"Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"If you be Mr. Marchdale, I know you by sight: for I have seen you with\r\nMr. Henry Bannerworth several times. Come out from among the shadows,\r\nand let us have a look at you; but, till you do, don\'t come within arm\'s\r\nlength of me. I am not naturally suspicious; but we cannot be too\r\ncareful."\r\n\r\n"Oh! certainly--certainly. The silver edge of the moon is now just\r\npeeping up from the east, and you will be able to see me well, if you\r\nstep from the shadow of the wall by which you now are."\r\n\r\nThis was a reasonable enough proposition, and Tom Eccles at once acceded\r\nto it, by stepping out boldly into the partial moonlight, which now\r\nbegan to fall upon the open meadows, tinting the grass with a silvery\r\nrefulgence, and rendering even minute objects visible. The moment he saw\r\nMarchdale he knew him, and, advancing frankly to him, he said,--\r\n\r\n"I know you, sir, well."\r\n\r\n"And what brings you here?"--"A wager for one thing, and a wish to see\r\nthe vampyre for another."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"--"Yes; I must own I have such a wish, along with a still\r\nstronger one, to capture him, if possible; and, as there are now two of\r\nus, why may we not do it?"\r\n\r\n"As for capturing him," said Marchdale, "I should prefer shooting\r\nhim."--"You would?"\r\n\r\n"I would, indeed. I have seen him once shot down, and he is now, I have\r\nno doubt, as well as ever. What were you doing with that huge stone I\r\nsaw you bending over?"--"I have some handkerchiefs to hide here, as a\r\nproof that I have to-night really been to this place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will show you a better spot, where there is a crevice in which\r\nyou can place them with perfect safety. Will you walk with me into the\r\nruins?"--"Willingly."\r\n\r\n"It\'s odd enough," remarked Marchdale, after he had shown Tom Eccles\r\nwhere to hide the handkerchiefs, "that you and I should both be here\r\nupon so similar an errand."--"I\'m very glad of it. It robs the place of\r\nits gloom, and makes it ten times more endurable than it otherwise would\r\nbe. What do you propose to do if you see the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"I shall try a pistol bullet on him. You say you are armed?"--"Yes."\r\n\r\n"With pistols?"--"One. Here it is."\r\n\r\n"A huge weapon; loaded well, of course?"--"Oh, yes, I can depend upon\r\nit; but I did not intend to use it, unless assailed."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well. What is that?"--"What--what?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see anything there? Come farther back. Look--look. At the\r\ncorner of that wall there I am certain there is the flutter of a human\r\ngarment."--"There is--there is."\r\n\r\n"Hush! Keep close. It must be the vampyre."--"Give me my pistol. What\r\nare you doing with it?"\r\n\r\n"Only ramming down the charge more firmly for you. Take it. If that be\r\nVarney the vampyre, I shall challenge him to surrender the moment he\r\nappears; and if he does not, I will fire upon him, and do you do so\r\nlikewise."--"Well, I--I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"You have scruples?"--"I certainly have."\r\n\r\n"Well, well--don\'t you fire, then, but leave it to me. There;\r\nlook--look. Now have you any doubt? There he goes; in his cloak. It\r\nis--it is----"--"Varney, by Heavens!" cried Tom Eccles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Surrender!" shouted Marchdale.\r\n\r\nAt the instant Sir Francis Varney sprang forward, and made off at a\r\nrapid pace across the meadows.\r\n\r\n"Fire after him--fire!" cried Marchdale, "or he will escape. My pistol\r\nhas missed fire. He will be off."\r\n\r\nOn the impulse of the moment, and thus urged by the voice and the\r\ngesture of his companion, Tom Eccles took aim as well as he could, and\r\nfired after the retreating form of Sir Francis Varney. His conscience\r\nsmote him as he heard the report and saw the flash of the large pistol\r\namid the half sort of darkness that was still around.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the shot was then to him painfully apparent. He saw Varney\r\nstop instantly; then make a vain attempt to stagger forward a little,\r\nand finally fall heavily to the earth, with all the appearance of one\r\nkilled upon the spot.\r\n\r\n"You have hit him," said Marchdale--"you have hit him. Bravo!"--"I\r\nhave--hit him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a capital shot, by Jove!"--"I am very sorry."\r\n\r\n"Sorry! sorry for ridding the world of such a being! What was in your\r\npistol?"--"A couple of slugs."\r\n\r\n"Well, they have made a lodgment in him, that\'s quite clear. Let\'s go up\r\nand finish him at once."--"He seems finished."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon there. When the moonbeams fall upon him he\'ll get up\r\nand walk away as if nothing was the matter."--"Will he?" cried Tom, with\r\nanimation--"will he?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly he will."--"Thank God for that. Now, hark you, Mr. Marchdale:\r\nI should not have fired if you had not at the moment urged me to do so.\r\nNow, I shall stay and see if the effect which you talk of will ensue;\r\nand although it may convince me that he is a vampyre, and that there are\r\nsuch things, he may go off, scot free, for me."\r\n\r\n"Go off?"--"Yes; I don\'t want to have even a vampyre\'s blood upon my\r\nhands."\r\n\r\n"You are exceedingly delicate."--"Perhaps I am; it\'s my way, though. I\r\nhave shot him--not you, mind; so, in a manner of speaking, he belongs to\r\nme. Now, mark, me: I won\'t have him touched any more to-night, unless\r\nyou think there\'s a chance of making a prisoner of him without\r\nviolence."\r\n\r\n"There he lies; you can go and make a prisoner of him at once, dead as\r\nhe is; and if you take him out of the moonlight--"\r\n\r\n"I understand; he won\'t recover."--"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"But, as I want him to recover, that don\'t suit me."--"Well, I cannot\r\nbut honour your scruples, although I do not actually share in them; but\r\nI promise you that, since such is your wish, I will take no steps\r\nagainst the vampyre; but let us come up to him and see if he be really\r\ndead, or only badly wounded."\r\n\r\nTom Eccles hang back a little from this proposal; but, upon being urged\r\nagain by Marchdale, and told that he need not go closer than he chose,\r\nhe consented, and the two of them approached the prostrate form of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, which lay upon its face in the faint moonlight, which\r\neach moment was gathering strength and power.\r\n\r\n"He lies upon his face," said Marchdale. "Will you go and turn him\r\nover?"--"Who--I? God forbid I should touch him."\r\n\r\n"Well--well, I will. Come on."\r\n\r\nThey halted within a couple of yards of the body. Tom Eccles would not\r\ngo a step farther; so Marchdale advanced alone, and pretended to be,\r\nwith great repugnance, examining for the wound.\r\n\r\n"He is quite dead," he said; "but I cannot see the hurt."--"I think he\r\nturned his head as I fired."\r\n\r\n"Did he? Let us see."\r\n\r\nMarchdale lifted up the head, and disclosed such a mass of\r\nclotted-looking blood, that Tom Eccles at once took to his heels, nor\r\nstopped until he was nearly as far off as the ruins. Marchdale followed\r\nhim more slowly, and when he came up to him, he said,--\r\n\r\n"The slugs have taken effect on his face."--"I know it--I know it. Don\'t\r\ntell me."\r\n\r\n"He looks horrible."--"And I am a murderer."\r\n\r\n"Psha! You look upon this matter too seriously. Think of who and what he\r\nwas, and then you will soon acquit yourself of being open to any such\r\ncharge."--"I am bewildered, Mr. Marchdale, and cannot now know whether\r\nhe be a vampyre or not. If he be not, I have murdered, most\r\nunjustifiably, a fellow-creature."\r\n\r\n"Well, but if he be?"--"Why, even then I do not know but that I ought to\r\nconsider myself as guilty. He is one of God\'s creatures if he were ten\r\ntimes a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Well, you really do take a serious view of the affair."--"Not more\r\nserious than it deserves."\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean to do?"--"I shall remain here to await the result\r\nof what you tell me will ensue, if he be a real vampire. Even now the\r\nmoonbeams are full upon him, and each moment increasing in intensity.\r\nThink you he will recover?"\r\n\r\n"I do indeed."--"Then here will I wait."\r\n\r\n"Since that is you resolve, I will keep you company. We shall easily\r\nfind some old stone in the ruins which will serve us for a seat, and\r\nthere at leisure we can keep our eyes upon the dead body, and be able to\r\nobserve if it make the least movement."\r\n\r\nThis plan was adopted, and they sat down just within the ruins, but in\r\nsuch a place that they had a full view of the dead body, as it appeared\r\nto be, of Sir Francis Varney, upon which the sweet moonbeams shone full\r\nand clear.\r\n\r\nTom Eccles related how he was incited to come upon his expedition, but\r\nhe might have spared himself that trouble, as Marchdale had been in a\r\nretired corner of the inn parlour before he came to his appointment with\r\nVarney, and heard the business for the most part proposed.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour, certainly not more, might have elapsed; when suddenly Tom\r\nEccles uttered an exclamation, partly of surprise and partly of\r\nterror,--\r\n\r\n"He moves; he moves!" he cried. "Look at the vampyre\'s body."\r\n\r\nMarchdale affected to look with an all-absorbing interest, and there was\r\nSir Francis Varney, raising slowly one arm with the hand outstretched\r\ntowards the moon, as if invoking that luminary to shed more of its beams\r\nupon him. Then the body moved slowly, like some one writhing in pain,\r\nand yet unable to move from the spot on which it lay. From the head to\r\nthe foot, the whole frame seemed to be convulsed, and now and then as\r\nthe ghastly object seemed to be gathering more strength, the limbs were\r\nthrown out with a rapid and a frightful looking violence.\r\n\r\nIt was truly to one, who might look upon it as a reality and no juggle,\r\na frightful sight to see, and although Marchdale, of course, tolerably\r\nwell preserved his equanimity, only now and then, for appearance sake,\r\naffecting to be wonderfully shocked, poor Tom Eccles was in such a state\r\nof horror and fright that he could not, if he would, have flown from the\r\nspot, so fascinated was he by the horrible spectacle.\r\n\r\nThis was a state of things which continued for many minutes, and then\r\nthe body showed evident symptoms of so much returning animation, that it\r\nwas about to rise from his gory bed and mingle once again with the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" said Marchdale--"behold!"--"Heaven have mercy upon us!"\r\n\r\n"It is as I said; the beams of the moon have revived the vampyre. You\r\nperceive now that there can be no doubt."--"Yes, yes, I see him; I see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney now, as if with a great struggle, rose to his feet,\r\nand looked up at the bright moon for some moments with such an air and\r\nmanner that it would not have required any very great amount of\r\nimagination to conceive that he was returning to it some sort of\r\nthanksgiving for the good that it had done to him.\r\n\r\nHe then seemed for some moments in a state of considerable indecision as\r\nto which way he should proceed. He turned round several times. Then he\r\nadvanced a step or two towards the house, but apparently his resolution\r\nchanged again, and casting his eyes upon the ruins, he at once made\r\ntowards them.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the philosophy as well as for the courage of Tom\r\nEccles. It was all very well to look on at some distance, and observe\r\nthe wonderful and inexplicable proceedings of the vampyre; but when he\r\nshowed symptoms of making a nearer acquaintance, it was not to be borne.\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s coming here," said Tom.--"He seems so indeed," remarked\r\nMarchdale.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to stay?"--"I think I shall."\r\n\r\n"You do, do you?"--"Yes, I should much like to question him, and as we\r\nare two to one I think we really can have nothing to fear."\r\n\r\n"Do you? I\'m altogether of a different opinion. A man who has more lives\r\nthan a cat don\'t much mind at what odds he fights. You may stay if you\r\nlike."--"You do not mean to say that you will desert me?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see a bit how you call it deserting you; if we had come out\r\ntogether on this adventure, I would have stayed it out with you; but as\r\nwe came separate and independent, we may as well go back so."--"Well,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"Good morning?" cried Tom, and he at once took to his heels towards the\r\ntown, without staying to pay any attention to the remonstrances of\r\nMarchdale, who called after him in vain.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney, probably, had Tom Eccles not gone off so rapidly,\r\nwould have yet taken another thought, and gone in another direction than\r\nthat which led him to the ruins, and Tom, if he had had his senses fully\r\nabout him, as well as all his powers of perception, would have seen that\r\nthe progress of the vampyre was very slow, while he continued to\r\nconverse with Marchdale, and that it was only when he went off at good\r\nspeed that Sir Francis Varney likewise thought it prudent to do so.\r\n\r\n"Is he much terrified?" said Varney, as he came up to Marchdale.--"Yes,\r\nmost completely."\r\n\r\n"This then, will make a good story in the town."--"It will, indeed, and\r\nnot a little enhance your reputation."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; it don\'t much matter now; but if by terrifying people I can\r\npurchase for myself anything like immunity for the past, I shall be\r\nsatisfied."--"I think you may now safely reckon that you have done so.\r\nThis man who has fled with so much precipitation, had courage."\r\n\r\n"Unquestionably."--"Or else he would have shrunk from coming here at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"True, but his courage and presence arose from his strong doubts as to\r\nthe existence of such beings as vampyres."--"Yes, and now that he is\r\nconvinced, his bravery has evaporated along with his doubts; and such a\r\ntale as he has now to tell, will be found sufficient to convert even the\r\nmost sceptical in the town."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."--"And yet it cannot much avail you."\r\n\r\n"Not personally, but I must confess that I am not dead to all human\r\nopinions, and I feel some desire of revenge against those dastards who\r\nby hundreds have hunted me, burnt down my mansion, and sought my\r\ndestruction."--"That I do not wonder at."\r\n\r\n"I would fain leave among them a legacy of fear. Such fear as shall\r\nhaunt them and their children for years to come. I would wish that the\r\nname of Varney, the vampire, should be a sound of terror for\r\ngenerations."--"It will be so."\r\n\r\n"It shall."--"And now, then, for a consideration of what is to be done\r\nwith our prisoner. What is your resolve upon that point?"\r\n\r\n"I have considered it while I was lying upon yon green sward waiting for\r\nthe friendly moonbeams to fall upon my face, and it seems to me that\r\nthere is no sort of resource but to----"--"Kill him?"\r\n\r\n"No, no."--"What then?"\r\n\r\n"To set him free."--"Nay, have you considered the immense hazard of\r\ndoing so? Think again; I pray you think again. I am decidedly of opinion\r\nthat he more than suspects who are his enemies; and, in that case, you\r\nknow what consequences would ensue; besides, have we not enough already\r\nto encounter? Why should we add another young, bold, determined spirit\r\nto the band which is already arrayed against us?"\r\n\r\n"You talk in vain, Marchdale; I know to what it all tends; you have a\r\nstrong desire for the death of this young man."--"No; there you wrong\r\nme. I have no desire for his death, for its own sake; but, where great\r\ninterests are at stake, there must be sacrifices made."\r\n\r\n"So there must; therefore, I will make a sacrifice, and let this young\r\nprisoner free from his dungeon."--"If such be your determination, I know\r\nwell it is useless to combat with it. When do you purpose giving him his\r\nfreedom?"\r\n\r\n"I will not act so heedlessly as that your principles of caution shall\r\nblame me. I will attempt to get from him some promise that he will not\r\nmake himself an active instrument against me. Perchance, too, as\r\nBannerworth Hall, which he is sure to visit, wears such an air of\r\ndesertion, I may be able to persuade him that the Bannerworth family, as\r\nwell as his uncle, have left this part of the country altogether; so\r\nthat, without making any inquiry for them about the neighbourhood, he\r\nmay be induced to leave at once."--"That would be well."\r\n\r\n"Good; your prudence approves of the plan, and therefore it shall be\r\ndone."--"I am rather inclined to think," said Marchdale, with a slight\r\ntone of sarcasm, "that if my prudence did not approve of the plan, it\r\nwould still be done."\r\n\r\n"Most probably," said Varney, calmly.--"Will you release him to-night?"\r\n\r\n"It is morning, now, and soon the soft grey light of day will tint the\r\neast. I do not think I will release him till sunset again now. Has he\r\nprovision to last him until then?"--"He has."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, two hours after sunset I will come here and release him\r\nfrom his weary bondage, and now I must go to find some place in which to\r\nhide my proscribed head. As for Bannerworth Hall, I will yet have it in\r\nmy power; I have sworn to do so, I will keep my oath."--"The\r\naccomplishment of our purpose, I regret to say, seems as far off as\r\never."\r\n\r\n"Not so--not so. As I before remarked, we must disappear, for a time, so\r\nas to lull suspicion. There will then arise a period when Bannerworth\r\nHall will neither be watched, as it is now, nor will it be inhabited,--a\r\nperiod before the Bannerworth family has made up its mind to go back to\r\nit, and when long watching without a result has become too tiresome to\r\nbe continued at all; then we can at once pursue our object."--"Be it\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"And now, Marchdale, I want more money."--"More money!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you know well that I have had large demands of late."--"But I\r\ncertainly had an impression that you were possessed, by the death of\r\nsome one, with very ample means."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but there is a means by which all is taken from me. I have no real\r\nresources but what are rapidly used up, so I must come upon you\r\nagain."--"I have already completely crippled myself as regards money\r\nmatters in this enterprise, and I do certainly hope that the fruits will\r\nnot be far distant. If they be much longer delayed, I shall really not\r\nknow what to do. However, come to the lodge where you have been staying,\r\nand then I will give you, to the extent of my ability, whatever sum you\r\nthink your present exigencies require."\r\n\r\n"Come on, then, at once. I would certainly, of course, rather leave this\r\nplace now, before daybreak. Come on, I say, come on."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney and Marchdale walked for some time in silence across\r\nthe meadows. It was evident that there was not between these associates\r\nthe very best of feelings. Marchdale was always smarting under an\r\nassumption of authority over him, on the part of Sir Francis Varney,\r\nwhile the latter scarcely cared to conceal any portion of the contempt\r\nwith which he regarded his hypocritical companion.\r\n\r\nSome very strong band of union, indeed, must surely bind these two\r\nstrange persons together! It must be something of a more than common\r\nnature which induces Marchdale not only to obey the behests of his\r\nmysterious companion, but to supply him so readily with money as we\r\nperceive he promises to do.\r\n\r\nAnd, as regards Varney, the vampyre, he, too, must have some great\r\nobject in view to induce him to run such a world of risk, and take so\r\nmuch trouble as he was doing with the Bannerworth family.\r\n\r\nWhat his object is, and what is the object of Marchdale, will, now that\r\nwe have progressed so far in our story, soon appear, and then much that\r\nis perfectly inexplicable, will become clear and distinct, and we shall\r\nfind that some strong human motives are at the bottom of it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nVARNEY\'S VISIT TO THE DUNGEON OF THE LONELY PRISONER IN THE RUINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvident it was that Marchdale was not near so scrupulous as Sir Francis\r\nVarney, in what he chose to do. He would, without hesitation, have\r\nsacrificed the life of that prisoner in the lonely dungeon, whom it\r\nwould be an insult to the understanding of our readers, not to presume\r\nthat they had, long ere this, established in their minds to be Charles\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nHis own safety seemed to be the paramount consideration with Marchdale,\r\nand it was evident that he cared for nothing in comparison with that\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIt says much, however, for Sir Francis Varney, that he did not give in\r\nto such a blood-thirsty feeling, but rather chose to set the prisoner\r\nfree, and run all the chances of the danger to which he might expose\r\nhimself by such a course of conduct, than to insure safety,\r\ncomparatively, by his destruction.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney is evidently a character of strangely mixed feelings.\r\nIt is quite evident that he has some great object in view, which he\r\nwishes to accomplish almost at any risk; but it is equally evident, at\r\nthe same time, that he wishes to do so with the least possible injury to\r\nothers, or else he would never have behaved as he had done in his\r\ninterview with the beautiful and persecuted Flora Bannerworth, or now\r\nsuggested the idea of setting Charles Holland free from the dreary\r\ndungeon in which he had been so long confined.\r\n\r\nWe are always anxious and willing to give every one credit for the good\r\nthat is in them; and, hence, we are pleased to find that Sir Francis\r\nVarney, despite his singular, and apparently preternatural capabilities,\r\nhas something sufficiently human about his mind and feelings, to induce\r\nhim to do as little injury as possible to others in the pursuit of his\r\nown objects.\r\n\r\nOf the two, vampyre as he is, we prefer him much to the despicable and\r\nhypocritical, Marchdale, who, under the pretence of being the friend of\r\nthe Bannerworth family, would freely have inflicted upon them the most\r\ndeadly injuries.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that he was most dreadfully disappointed that Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, would not permit him to take the life of Charles\r\nHolland, and it was with a gloomy and dissatisfied air that he left the\r\nruins to proceed towards the town, after what we may almost term the\r\naltercation he had had with Varney the vampyre upon that subject.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Sir Francis Varney, however, was blind to\r\nthe danger which must inevitably accrue from permitting Charles Holland\r\nonce more to obtain his liberty.\r\n\r\nWhat the latter would be able to state would be more than sufficient to\r\nconvince the Bannerworths, and all interested in their fortunes, that\r\nsomething was going on of a character, which, however, supernatural it\r\nmight seem to be, still seemed to have some human and ordinary objects\r\nfor its ends.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney thought over all this before he proceeded, according\r\nto his promise, to the dungeon of the prisoner; but it would seem as if\r\nthere was considerable difficulty, even to an individual of his long\r\npractice in all kinds of chicanery and deceit, in arriving at any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, as to a means of making Charles Holland\'s\r\nrelease a matter of less danger to himself, than it would be likely to\r\nbe, if, unfettered by obligation, he was at once set free.\r\n\r\nAt the solemn hour of midnight, while all was still, that is, to say, on\r\nthe night succeeding the one, on which he had had the interview with\r\nMarchdale, we have recorded, Sir Francis Varney alone sought the silent\r\nruins. He was attired, as usual, in his huge cloak, and, indeed, the\r\nchilly air of the evening warranted such protection against its numerous\r\ndiscomforts.\r\n\r\nHad any one seen him, however, that evening, they would have observed an\r\nair of great doubt, and irresolution upon his brow, as if he were\r\nstruggling with some impulses which he found it extremely difficult to\r\nrestrain.\r\n\r\n"I know well," he muttered, as he walked among the shadow of the ruins,\r\n"that Marchdale\'s reasoning is coldly and horribly correct, when he says\r\nthat there is danger in setting this youth free; but, I am about to\r\nleave this place, and not to show myself for some time, and I cannot\r\nreconcile myself to inflicting upon him the horror of a death by\r\nstarvation, which must ensue."\r\n\r\nIt was a night of more than usual dullness, and, as Sir Francis Varney\r\nremoved the massy stone, which hid the narrow and tortuous entrance to\r\nthe dungeons, a chilly feeling crept over him, and he could not help\r\nsupposing, that even then Marchdale might have played him false, and\r\nneglected to supply the prisoner food, according to his promise.\r\n\r\nHastily he descended to the dungeons, and with a step, which had in it\r\nfar less of caution, than had usually characterised his proceedings, he\r\nproceeded onwards until he reached that particular dungeon, in which our\r\nyoung friend, to whom we wished so well, had been so long confined from\r\nthe beautiful and cheering light of day, and from all that his heart\'s\r\nbest affections most cling to.\r\n\r\n"Speak," said Sir Francis Varney, as he entered the dungeon--"If the\r\noccupant of this dreary place live, let him answer one who is as much\r\nhis friend as he has been his enemy."\r\n\r\n"I have no friend," said Charles Holland, faintly; "unless it be one who\r\nwould come and restore me to liberty."\r\n\r\n"And how know you that I am not he?"\r\n\r\n"Your voice sounds like that of one of my persecutors. Why do you not\r\nplace the climax to your injuries by at once taking away life. I should\r\nbe better pleased that you would do so, than that I should wear out the\r\nuseless struggle of existence in so dreary and wretched an abode as\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Young man," said Sir Francis Varney, "I have come to you on a greater\r\nerrand of mercy than, probably, you will ever give me credit for. There\r\nis one who would too readily have granted your present request, and who\r\nwould at once have taken that life of which you profess to be so\r\nwearied; but which may yet present to you some of its sunniest and most\r\nbeautiful aspects."\r\n\r\n"Your tones are friendly," said Charles; "but yet I dread some new\r\ndeception. That you are one of those who consigned me by stratagem, and\r\nby brute force, to this place of durance, I am perfectly well assured,\r\nand, therefore, any good that may be promised by you, presents itself to\r\nme in a very doubtful character."\r\n\r\n"I cannot be surprised," said Sir Francis Varney, "at such sentiments\r\narising from your lips; but, nevertheless, I am inclined to save you.\r\nYou have been detained here because it was supposed by being so, a\r\nparticular object would be best obtained by your absence. That object,\r\nhowever has failed, notwithstanding, and I do not feel further inclined\r\nto protract your sufferings. Have you any guess as to the parties who\r\nhave thus confined you?"--"I am unaccustomed to dissemble, and,\r\ntherefore I will say at once that I have a guess."\r\n\r\n"In which way does it tend?"--\r\n\r\n"Against Sir Francis Varney, called the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Does it not strike you that this may be a dangerous candour?"--"It may,\r\nor it may not be; I cannot help it. I know I am at the mercy of my foes,\r\nand I do not believe that anything I can say or do will make my\r\nsituation worse or better."\r\n\r\n"You are much mistaken there. In other hands than mine, it might make it\r\nmuch worse; but it happens to be one of my weaknesses, that I am charged\r\nwith candour, and that I admire boldness of disposition."--"Indeed! and\r\nyet can behave in the manner you have done towards me."\r\n\r\n"Yes. There are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in\r\nyour philosophy. I am the more encouraged to set you free, because, if I\r\nprocure from you a promise, which I intend to attempt, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that you will keep it."--"I shall assuredly keep whatever\r\npromise I may make. Propound your conditions, and if they be such as\r\nhonour and honesty will permit me to accede to, I will do so willingly\r\nand at once. Heaven knows I am weary enough of this miserable\r\nimprisonment."\r\n\r\n"Will you promise me then, if I set you free, not to mention your\r\nsuspicions that it is to Sir Francis Varney you owe this ill turn, and\r\nnot to attempt any act of vengeance against him as a retaliation for\r\nit."--"I cannot promise so much as that. Freedom, indeed, would be a\r\npoor boon, if I were not permitted freely to converse of some of the\r\ncircumstances connected with my captivity."\r\n\r\n"You object?"--"I do to the former of your propositions, but not to the\r\nlatter. I will promise not to go at all out of my way to execute any\r\nvengeance upon you; but I will not promise that I will not communicate\r\nthe circumstances of my forced absence from them, to those friends whose\r\nopinion I so much value, and to return to whom is almost as dear to me\r\nas liberty itself."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney was silent for a few moments, and then he said, in a\r\ntone of deep solemnity,--\r\n\r\n"There are ninety-nine persons out of a hundred who would take your life\r\nfor the independence of your tongue; but I am as the hundredth one, who\r\nlooks with a benevolent eye at your proceedings. Will you promise me, if\r\nI remove the fetters which now bind your limbs, that you will make no\r\npersonal attack upon me; for I am weary of personal contention, and I\r\nhave no disposition to endure it. Will you make me this promise?"--"I\r\npromise?"--"I will."\r\n\r\nWithout another word, but trusting implicitly to the promise which had\r\nbeen given to him, Sir Francis Varney produced a small key from his\r\npocket, and unlocked with it a padlock which confined the chains about\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\nWith ease, Charles Holland was then enabled to shake them off, and then,\r\nfor the first time, for some weeks, he rose to his feet, and felt all\r\nthe exquisite relief of being comparatively free from bondage.\r\n\r\n"This is delightful, indeed," he said.\r\n\r\n"It is," said Sir Francis Varney--"it is but a foretaste of the\r\nhappiness you will enjoy when you are entirely free. You see that I have\r\ntrusted you."\r\n\r\n"You have trusted me as you might trust me, and you perceive that I have\r\nkept my word."\r\n\r\n"You have; and since you decline to make me the promise which I would\r\nfain have from you, to the effect that you would not mention me as one\r\nof the authors of your calamity, I must trust to your honour not to\r\nattempt revenge for what you have suffered."\r\n\r\n"That I will promise. There can be but little difficulty to any generous\r\nmind in giving up such a feeling. In consequence of your sparing me what\r\nyou might still further have inflicted, I will let the past rest, and as\r\nif it had never happened really to me; and speak of it to others, but as\r\na circumstance which I wish not to revert to, but prefer should be\r\nburied in oblivion."\r\n\r\n"It is well; and now I have a request to make of you, which, perhaps,\r\nyou will consider the hardest of all."\r\n\r\n"Name it. I feel myself bound to a considerable extent to comply with\r\nwhatever you may demand of me, that is not contrary to honourable\r\nprinciple."\r\n\r\n"Then it is this, that, comparatively free as you are, and in a\r\ncondition, as you are, to assert your own freedom, you will not do so\r\nhastily, or for a considerable period; in fact, I wish and expect that\r\nyou should wait yet awhile, until it shall suit me to say that it is my\r\npleasure that you shall be free."\r\n\r\n"That is, indeed, a hard condition to man who feels, as you yourself\r\nremark, that he can assert his freedom. It is one which I have still a\r\nhope you will not persevere in.\r\n\r\n"Nay, young man, I think that I have treated you with generosity, to\r\nmake you feel that I am not the worst of foes you could have had. All I\r\nrequire of you is, that you should wait here for about an hour. It is\r\nnow nearly one o\'clock; will you wait until you hear it strike two\r\nbefore you actually make a movement to leave this place?"\r\n\r\nCharles Holland hesitated for some moments, and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"Do not fancy that I am not one who appreciates the singular trust you\r\nhave reposed in me; and, however repugnant to me it may be to remain\r\nhere, a voluntary prisoner, I am inclined to do so, if it be but to\r\nconvince you that the trust you have reposed in me is not in vain, and\r\nthat I can behave with equal generosity to you as you can to me."\r\n\r\n"Be it so," said Sir Francis Varney; "I shall leave you with a full\r\nreliance that you will keep your word; and now, farewell. When you think\r\nof me, fancy me rather one unfortunate than criminal, and tell yourself\r\nthat even Varney the vampyre had some traits in his character, which,\r\nalthough they might not raise your esteem, at all events did not loudly\r\ncall for your reprobation."\r\n\r\n"I shall do so. Oh! Flora, Flora, I shall look upon you once again,\r\nafter believing and thinking that I had bidden you a long and last\r\nadieu. My own beautiful Flora, it is joy indeed to think that I shall\r\nlook upon that face again, which, to my perception, is full of all the\r\nmajesty of loveliness."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney looked coldly on while Charles uttered this\r\nenthusiastic speech.\r\n\r\n"Remember," he said, "till two o\'clock;" and he walked towards the door\r\nof the dungeon. "You will have no difficulty in finding your way out\r\nfrom this place. Doubtless you already perceive the entrance by which I\r\ngained admission."\r\n\r\n"Had I been free," said Charles, "and had the use of my limbs, I should,\r\nlong ere this, have worked my way to life and liberty."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well. Goodnight."\r\n\r\nVarney walked from the place, and just closed the door behind him. With\r\na slow and stately step he left the ruins, and Charles Holland found\r\nhimself once more alone, but in a much more enviable condition than for\r\nmany weeks he could have called his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nFLORA BANNERWORTH\'S APPARENT INCONSISTENCY.--THE ADMIRAL\'S CIRCUMSTANCES\r\nAND ADVICE.--MR. CHILLINGWORTH\'S MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor a brief space let us return to Flora Bannerworth, who had suffered\r\nso much on account of her affections, as well as on account of the\r\nmysterious attack that had been made upon her by the reputed vampyre.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Bannerworth Hall for a short time, she seemed to recover\r\nher spirits; but this was a state of things which did not last, and only\r\nshowed how fallacious it was to expect that, after the grievous things\r\nthat had happened, she would rapidly recover her equanimity.\r\n\r\nIt is said, by learned physiologists, that two bodily pains cannot\r\nendure at the same space of time in the system; and, whether it be so or\r\nnot, is a question concerning which it would be foreign to the nature of\r\nour work, to enter into anything like an elaborate disquisition.\r\n\r\nCertainly, however, so far as Flora Bannerworth was concerned, she\r\nseemed inclined to show that, mentally, the observation was a true one,\r\nfor that, now she became released from a continued dread of the visits\r\nof the vampyre, her mind would, with more painful interest than ever,\r\nrecur to the melancholy condition, probably, of Charles Holland, if he\r\nwere alive, and to soul-harrowing reflections concerning him, if he were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nShe could not, and she did not, believe, for one moment, that his\r\ndesertion of her had been of a voluntary character. She knew, or fancied\r\nshe knew, him by far too well for that; and she more than once expressed\r\nher opinion, to the effect that she was perfectly convinced his\r\ndisappearance was a part and parcel of all that train of circumstances\r\nwhich had so recently occurred, and produced such a world of unhappiness\r\nto her, as well as to the whole of the Bannerworth family.\r\n\r\n"If he had never loved me," she said to her brother Henry, "he would\r\nhave been alive and well; but he has fallen a victim to the truth of a\r\npassion, and to the constancy of an affection which, to my dying day, I\r\nwill believe in."\r\n\r\nNow that Mr. Marchdale had left the place there was no one to dispute\r\nthis proposition with Flora, for all, as well as she, were fully\r\ninclined to think well of Charles Holland.\r\n\r\nIt was on the very morning which preceded that evening when Sir Francis\r\nVarney called upon Charles Holland in the manner we have related, with\r\nthe gratifying news that, upon certain conditions, he might be released,\r\nthat Flora Bannerworth, when the admiral came to see them, spoke to him\r\nof Charles Holland, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, that I am away from Bannerworth Hall, I do not, and cannot\r\nfeel satisfied; for the thought that Charles may eventually come back,\r\nand seek us there, still haunts me. Fancy him, sir, doing so, and seeing\r\nthe place completely deserted."\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s something in that," said the admiral; "but, however, he\'s\r\nhardly such a goose, if it were so to happen, to give up the chase--he\'d\r\nfind us out somehow."\r\n\r\n"You think he would, sir? or, do you not think that despair would seize\r\nupon him, and that, fancying we had all left the spot for ever, he might\r\nlikewise do so; so that we should lose him more effectually than we have\r\ndone at present?"\r\n\r\n"No; hardly," said the admiral; "he couldn\'t be such a goose as that.\r\nWhy, when I was of his age, if I had secured the affections of a young\r\ngirl like you, I\'d have gone over all the world, but I\'d have found out\r\nwhere she was; and what I mean to say is, if he\'s half such a goose as\r\nyou think him, he deserves to lose you."\r\n\r\n"Did you not tell me something, sir, of Mr. Chillingworth talking of\r\ntaking possession of the Hall for a brief space of time?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, I did; and I expect he is there now; in fact, I\'m sure he\'s\r\nthere, for he said he would be."\r\n\r\n"No, he ain\'t," said Jack Pringle, at that moment entering the room;\r\n"you\'re wrong again, as you always are, somehow or other."\r\n\r\n"What, you vagabond, are you here, you mutinous rascal?"--"Ay, ay, sir;\r\ngo on; don\'t mind me. I wonder what you\'d do, sir, if you hadn\'t\r\nsomebody like me to go on talking about."\r\n\r\n"Why, you infernal rascal, I wonder what you\'d do if you had not an\r\nindulgent commander, who puts up even with real mutiny, and says nothing\r\nabout it. But where have you been? Did you go as I directed you, and\r\ntake some provisions to Bannerworth Hall?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did; but I brought them back again; there\'s nobody there, and\r\ndon\'t seem likely to be, except a dead body."\r\n\r\n"A dead body! Whose body can that be!"--"Tom somebody; for I\'m d----d if\r\nit ain\'t a great he cat."\r\n\r\n"You scoundrel, how dare you alarm me in such a way? But do you mean to\r\ntell me that you did not see Dr. Chillingworth at the Hall?"--"How could\r\nI see him, if he wasn\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"But he was there; he said he would be there."--"Then he\'s gone again,\r\nfor there\'s nobody there that I know of in the shape of a doctor. I went\r\nthrough every part of the ship--I mean the house--and the deuce a soul\r\ncould I find; so as it was rather lonely and uncomfortable, I came away\r\nagain. \'Who knows,\' thought I, \'but some blessed vampyre or another may\r\ncome across me.\'"\r\n\r\n"This won\'t do," said the old admiral, buttoning up his coat to the\r\nchin; "Bannerworth Hall must not be deserted in this way. It is quite\r\nclear that Sir Francis Varney and his associates have some particular\r\nobject in view in getting possession of the place. Here, you\r\nJack."--"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Just go back again, and stay at the Hall till somebody comes to you.\r\nEven such a stupid hound as you will be something to scare away\r\nunwelcome visitors. Go back to the Hall, I say. What are you staring\r\nat?"--"Back to Bannerworth Hall!" said Jack. "What! just where I\'ve come\r\nfrom; all that way off, and nothing to eat, and, what\'s worse, nothing\r\nto drink. I\'ll see you d----d first."\r\n\r\nThe admiral caught up a table-fork, and made a rush at Jack; but Henry\r\nBannerworth interfered.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he said, "admiral; no, no--not that. You must recollect that\r\nyou yourself have given this, no doubt, faithful fellow of your\'s\r\nliberty to do and say a great many things which don\'t look like good\r\nservice; but I have no doubt, from what I have seen of his disposition,\r\nthat he would risk his life rather than, that you should come to any\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," said Jack; "he quite forgets when the bullets were scuttling\r\nour nobs off Cape Ushant, when that big Frenchman had hold of him by the\r\n_skirf_ of his neck, and began pummelling his head, and the lee scuppers\r\nwere running with blood, and a bit of Joe Wiggins\'s brains had come slap\r\nin my eye, while some of Jack Marling\'s guts was hanging round my neck\r\nlike a nosegay, all in consequence of grape-shot--then he didn\'t say as\r\nI was a swab, when I came up, and bored a hole in the Frenchman\'s back\r\nwith a pike. Ay, it\'s all very well now, when there\'s peace, and no\r\ndanger, to call Jack Pringle a lubberly rascal, and mutinous. I\'m\r\nblessed if it ain\'t enough to make an old pair of shoes faint away."\r\n\r\n"Why, you infernal scoundrel," said the admiral, "nothing of the sort\r\never happened, and you know it. Jack, you\'re no seaman."--"Werry good,"\r\nsaid Jack; "then, if I ain\'t no seaman, you are what shore-going people\r\ncalls a jolly fat old humbug."\r\n\r\n"Jack, hold your tongue," said Henry Bannerworth; "you carry these\r\nthings too far. You know very well that your master esteems you, and you\r\nshould not presume too much upon that fact."--"My master!" said Jack;\r\n"don\'t call him my master. I never had a master, and don\'t intend. He\'s\r\nmy admiral, if you like; but an English sailor don\'t like a master."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is, Jack," said the admiral; "you\'ve got your good\r\nqualities, I admit."--"Ay, ay, sir--that\'s enough; you may as well leave\r\noff well while you can."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll just tell you what you resemble more than anything\r\nelse."--"Chew me up! what may that be, sir?"\r\n\r\n"A French marine."--"A what! A French marine! Good-bye. I wouldn\'t say\r\nanother word to you, if you was to pay me a dollar a piece. Of all the\r\nblessed insults rolled into one, this here\'s the worstest. You might\r\nhave called me a marine, or you might have called me a Frenchman, but to\r\nmake out that I\'m both a marine and a Frenchman, d--me, if it isn\'t\r\nenough to make human nature stand on an end! Now, I\'ve done with you."\r\n\r\n"And a good job, too," said the admiral. "I wish I\'d thought of it\r\nbefore. You\'re worse than a third day\'s ague, or a hot and a cold fever\r\nin the tropics."--"Very good," said Jack; "I only hope Providence will\r\nhave mercy upon you, and keep an eye upon you when I\'m gone, otherwise,\r\nI wonder what will become of you? It wasn\'t so when young Belinda, who\r\nyou took off the island of Antiggy, in the Ingies, jumped overboard, and\r\nI went after her in a heavy swell. Howsomdever, never mind, you shook\r\nhands with me then; and while a bushel of the briny was weeping out of\r\nthe corner of each of your blinkers, you says, says you,--"\r\n\r\n"Hold!" cried the admiral, "hold! I know what I said, Jack. It\'s cut a\r\nfathom deep in my memory. Give us your fist, Jack, and--and--"--"Hold\r\nyourself," said Jack; "I know what you\'re going to say, and I won\'t hear\r\nyou say it--so there\'s an end of it. Lor bless you! I knows you. I ain\'t\r\na going to leave you. Don\'t be afraid; I only works you up, and works\r\nyou down again, just to see if there\'s any of that old spirit in you\r\nwhen we was aboard the Victory. Don\'t you recollect, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes; enough, Jack."--"Why, let me see--that was a matter of forty\r\nyears ago, nearly, when I was a youngster."\r\n\r\n"There--there, Jack--that\'ll do. You bring the events of other years\r\nfresh upon my memory. Peace--peace. I have not forgotten; but still, to\r\nhear what you know of them, if recited, would give the old man a\r\npang."--"A pang," said Jack; "I suppose that\'s some dictionary word for\r\na punch in the eye. That would be mutiny with a vengeance; so I\'m off."\r\n\r\n"Go, go."--"I\'m a going; and just to please you, I\'ll go to the Hall, so\r\nyou sha\'n\'t say that you told me to do anything that I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nAway went Jack, whistling an air, that might have been popular when he\r\nand the admiral were young, and Henry Bannerworth could not but remark\r\nthat an appearance of great sadness came over the old man, when Jack was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"I fear, sir," he said, "that heedless sailor has touched upon some\r\nepisode in your existence, the wounds of which are still fresh enough to\r\ngive you pain."--"It is so," said the old admiral; "just look at me,\r\nnow. Do I look like the hero of a romantic love story?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, I admit."--"Well, notwithstanding that, Jack Pringle has\r\ntouched a chord that vibrates in my heart yet," replied the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Have you any objection to tell me of it?"--"None, whatever; and\r\nperhaps, by the time I have done, the doctor may have found his way back\r\nagain, or Jack may bring us some news of him. So here goes for a short,\r\nbut a true yarn."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMIRAL\'S STORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL BELINDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Flora Bannerworth stole into the room from whence\r\nshe had departed a short time since; but when she saw that old Admiral\r\nBell was looking so exceedingly serious, and apparently about to address\r\nHenry upon some very important subject, she would have retired, but he\r\nturned towards her, and said,--\r\n\r\n"My story, my dear, I\'ve no objection to your hearing, and, like all\r\nwomen folks, a love story never comes amiss to you; so you may as well\r\nstay and hear it."--"A love story," said Flora; "you tell a love story,\r\nsir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, and not only tell it, but be the hero of it, likewise;\r\nain\'t you astonished?"--"I am, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll be more astonished then before I\'ve done; so just listen.\r\nAs Jack Pringle says, it was the matter of about somewhere forty years\r\nago, that I was in command of the Victory frigate, which was placed upon\r\nthe West Indian station, during a war then raging, for the protection of\r\nour ports and harbours in that vicinity. We\'d not a strong force in that\r\nquarter, therefore, I had to cut about from place to place, and do the\r\nbest I could. After a time, though, I rather think that we frightened\r\noff the enemy, during which time I chiefly anchored off the island of\r\nAntigua, and was hospitably received at the house of a planter, of the\r\nname of Marchant, who, in fact, made his house my home, and introduced\r\nme to all the _elite_ of the society of the island. Ah! Miss Flora,\r\nyou\'ve no idea, to look at me now, what I was then; I held a captain\'s\r\ncommission, and was nearly the youngest man in the service, with such a\r\nrank. I was as slender, ay, as a dancing master. These withered and\r\nbleached locks were black as the raven\'s plume. Ay, ay, but no matter:\r\nthe planter had a daughter."\r\n\r\n"And you loved her?" said Flora--"Loved her," said the old man, and the\r\nflush of youthful animation come to his countenance; "loved her, do you\r\nsay! I adored her; I worshipped her; she was to me--but what a d----d\r\nold fool, I am; we\'ll skip that if you please."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said Flora; "that is what I want to hear."--"I haven\'t the\r\nleast doubt of that, in the world; but that\'s just what you won\'t hear;\r\nnone of your nonsense, Miss Flora; the old man may be a fool, but he\r\nisn\'t quite an idiot."\r\n\r\n"He\'s neither," said Flora; "true feelings can never disgrace any\r\none."--"Perhaps not; but, however, to make a long story short, somehow\r\nor other, one day, Belinda was sitting alone, and I rudely pounced upon\r\nher; I rather think then I must have said something that I oughtn\'t to\r\nhave said, for it took her so aback; I was forced, somehow or other, to\r\nhold her up, and then I--I--yes; I\'m sure I kissed her; and so, I told\r\nher I loved her; and then, what do you think she said?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Flora, "that she reciprocated the passion."--"D--n my rags,"\r\nsaid Jack, who at the moment came into the room, "I suppose that\'s the\r\nname of some shell or other."\r\n\r\n"You here, you villain!" said the admiral; "I thought you were\r\ngone."--"So I was," said Jack, "but I came back for my hat, you see."\r\n\r\nAway he went again, and the admiral resumed his story.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Flora," he said, "you haven\'t made a good guess, as she\r\ndidn\'t say anything at all, she only clung to me like some wild bird to\r\nits mother\'s breast, and cried as if her heart would break."--"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I didn\'t know the cause of her emotion, but at last I got it out\r\nof her."--"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a mere trifle; she was already married to somebody else, that\'s\r\nall; some d----d fellow, who had gone trading about the islands, a\r\nfellow she didn\'t care a straw about, that was old enough to be her\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"And you left her?"--"No, I didn\'t. Guess again. I was a mad-headed\r\nyoungster. I only felt--I didn\'t think. I persuaded her to come away\r\nwith me. I took her aboard my ship, and set sail with her. A few weeks\r\nflew like hours; but one day we were hailed by a vessel, and when we\r\nneared her, she manned a boat and brought a letter on board, addressed\r\nto Belinda. It was from her father, written in his last moments. It\r\nbegan with a curse and ended with a blessing. There was a postscript in\r\nanother hand, to say the old man died of grief. She read it by my side\r\non the quarter-deck. It dropped from her grasp, and she plunged into the\r\nsea. Jack Pringle went after her; but I never saw her again."\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heavens! what a tragedy!"--"Yes, tolerable," said the old man.\r\n\r\nHe arose and took his hat and placed it on his head. He gave the crown\r\nof it a blow that sent it nearly over his eyes. He thrust his hands deep\r\ninto his breeches pockets, clenched his teeth, and muttered something\r\ninaudible as he strode from the apartment.\r\n\r\n"Who would have thought, Henry," said Flora, "that such a man as Admiral\r\nBell had been the hero of such an adventure?"--"Ay, who indeed; but it\r\nshows that we never can judge from appearances, Flora; and that those\r\nwho seem to us the most heart-whole may have experienced the wildest\r\nvicissitudes of passion."\r\n\r\n"And we must remember, likewise, that this was forty years ago, Henry,\r\nwhich makes a material difference in the state of the case as regards\r\nAdmiral Bell."\r\n\r\n"It does indeed--more than half a lifetime; and yet how evident it was\r\nthat his old feelings clung to him. I can well imagine the many hours of\r\nbitter regret which the memory of this his lost love must have given\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"True--true. I can feel something for him; for have I not lost one who\r\nloved me--a worse loss, too, than that which Admiral Bell relates; for\r\nam I not a prey to all the horrors of uncertainty? Whereas he knew the\r\nworst, and that, at all events, death had claimed its victim, leaving\r\nnothing to conjecture in the shape of suffering, so that the mind had\r\nnothing to do but to recover slowly, but surely, as it would from the\r\nshock which it had received."\r\n\r\n"That is worse than you, Flora; but rather would I have you cherish hope\r\nof soon beholding Charles Holland, probably alive and well, than fancy\r\nany great disaster has come over him."\r\n\r\n"I will endeavour to do so," replied Flora.\r\n\r\n"I long to hear what has become of Dr. Chillingworth. His disappearance\r\nis most singular; for I fully suspected that he had some particular\r\nobject in view in getting possession for a short time of Bannerworth\r\nHall; but now, from Jack Pringle\'s account, he appears not to be in it,\r\nand, in fact, to have disappeared completely from the sight of all who\r\nknew him."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Flora; "but he may have done that, brother, still in\r\nfurtherance of his object."\r\n\r\n"It may be so, and I will hope that it is so. Keep yourself close,\r\nsister, and see no one, while I proceed to his house to inquire if they\r\nhave heard anything of him. I will return soon, be assured; and, in the\r\nmeantime, should you see my brother, tell him I shall be at home in an\r\nhour or so, and not to leave the cottage; for it is more than likely\r\nthat the admiral has gone to Bannerworth Hall, so that you may not see\r\nanything of him for some time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nMARCHDALE\'S ATTEMPTED VILLANY, AND THE RESULT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVarney the vampyre left the dungeon of Charles Holland amid the grey\r\nruins, with a perfect confidence the young man would keep his word, and\r\nnot attempt to escape from that place until the time had elapsed which\r\nhe had dictated to him.\r\n\r\nAnd well might he have that confidence, for having once given his word\r\nthat he would remain until he heard the clock strike two from a\r\nneighbouring church, Charles Holland never dreamt for a moment of\r\nbreaking it.\r\n\r\nTo be sure it was a weary time to wait when liberty appeared before him;\r\nbut he was the soul of honour, and the least likely man in all the world\r\nto infringe in the slightest upon the condition which he had, of his own\r\nfree will, acceded to.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney walked rapidly until he came nearly to the outskirts\r\nof the town, and then he slackened his pace, proceeding more cautiously,\r\nand looking carefully about him, as if he feared to meet any one who\r\nmight recognise him.\r\n\r\nHe had not proceeded far in this manner, when he became conscious of the\r\ncautious figure of a man gliding along in the opposite direction to that\r\nwhich he was taking.\r\n\r\nA suspicion struck him, from the general appearance, that it was\r\nMarchdale, and if so he wondered to see him abroad at such a time. Still\r\nhe would not be quite certain; but he hurried forward, so as to meet the\r\nadvancing figure, and then his suspicions were confirmed; and Marchdale,\r\nwith some confusion in his looks and manners, accosted him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Sir Francis Varney," he said, "you are out late."--\r\n\r\n"Why, you know I should be out late," said Varney, "and you likewise\r\nknow the errand upon which I was to be out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I recollect; you were to release your prisoner."--\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was."\r\n\r\n"And have you done so?"--\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed. I--I am glad you have taken better thoughts of it. Good\r\nnight--good night; we shall meet to-morrow."--\r\n\r\n"Adieu," said Sir Francis Varney; and he watched the retreating figure\r\nof Marchdale, and then he added, in a low tone to himself,--\r\n\r\n"I know his object well. His craven spirit shrinks at the notion, a\r\nprobable enough one, I will admit, that Charles Holland has recognised\r\nhim, and that, if once free, he would denounce him to the Bannerworths,\r\nholding him up to scorn in his true colours, and bringing down upon his\r\nhead, perhaps, something more than detestation and contempt. The\r\nvillain! he is going now to take the life of the man whom he considers\r\nchained to the ground. Well, well, they must fight it out together.\r\nCharles Holland is sufficiently free to take his own part, although\r\nMarchdale little thinks that such is the case."\r\n\r\nMarchdale walked on for some little distance, and then he turned and\r\nlooked after Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" he said; "so you have not released him to-night, but I know\r\nwell will do so soon. I do not, for my part, admire this romantic\r\ngenerosity which sets a fox free at the moment that he\'s the most\r\ndangerous. It\'s all very well to be generous, but it is better to be\r\njust first, and that I consider means looking after one\'s self first. I\r\nhave a poniard here which will soon put an end to the troubles of the\r\nprisoner in his dungeon--its edge is keen and sharp, and will readily\r\nfind a way to his heart."\r\n\r\nHe walked on quite exultingly and carelessly now, for he had got into\r\nthe open country, and it was extremely unlikely that he would meet\r\nanybody on his road to the ruins.\r\n\r\nIt did not take many minutes, sharp walking now to bring him close to\r\nthe spot which he intended should become such a scene of treacherous\r\nslaughter, and just then he heard from afar off something like the\r\nmuttering of thunder, as if Heaven itself was proclaiming its vengeance\r\nagainst the man who had come out to slay one of its best and noblest\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n"What is that\'" said Marchdale, shrinking back a moment; "what is\r\nthat--an approaching storm? It must be so, for, now I recollect me, the\r\nsun set behind a bank of clouds of a fiery redness, and as the evening\r\ndrew in there was every appearance in the heavens of some ensuing strife\r\nof the elements."\r\n\r\nHe listened for a few moments, and fixed his eyes intently in the\r\ndirection of the horizon from where the muttering sounds had proceeded.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wait before he saw a bright flash of blue lightning,\r\nwhich for one instant illumined the sky; then by the time he could have\r\ncounted twelve there came the thunder which the flash preceded, and he\r\nfelt terribly anxious to complete his enterprize, so that he might get\r\nback to the town and be safely housed before the storm, which was\r\nevidently approaching, should burst upon him.\r\n\r\n"It is sweeping on apace," he said; "why did I not come earlier?"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he plunged among the recesses of the ruins, and\r\nsearching about for the old stone which covered the entrance to the\r\ndungeon, he was surprised to find it rolled from its place, and the\r\naperture open.\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of this?" he said; "how negligent of Sir Francis\r\nVarney; or perhaps, after all, he was only jesting with me, and let the\r\nprisoner go. If that should be the case, I am foiled indeed; but surely\r\nhe could not be so full of indiscretion."\r\n\r\nAgain came a dazzling flash of lightning, which now, surrounded by the\r\nruins as he was, made him shrink back and cover his eyes for a moment;\r\nand then followed a peal of thunder with not half the duration of time\r\nbetween it and the flash which had characterized the previous electric\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n"The storm approaches fast," said Marchdale; "I must get my work done\r\nquickly, if indeed my victim be here, which I begin seriously to doubt."\r\n\r\nHe descended the intricate winding passage to the vault below, which\r\nserved the purpose of a dungeon, and when he got very nearly into the\r\ndepth of its recesses, he called aloud, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Ho! what ho! is there any one here?"--"Yes," said Charles Holland, who\r\nfancied it might be his former visitor returned. "Have you come to\r\nrepent of your purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Marchdale to himself, "Sir Francis, after all, has told me\r\nthe truth--the prisoner is still here."\r\n\r\nThe light from without was not near sufficient to send the least ray\r\ninto the depths of that dungeon; so that Marchdale, when he entered the\r\nplace, could see nothing but an absolute blackness.\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however, with Charles Holland, whose eyes had been now so\r\nlong accustomed to the place that he could see in it as if a dim\r\ntwilight irradiated it, and he at once, in his visitor, saw his worst\r\nfoe, and not the man who had comparatively set him free.\r\n\r\nHe saw, too, that the hand of his visitor grasped a weapon, which\r\nMarchdale thought that, favoured by the darkness, he might carry openly\r\nin perfect security.\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" said Marchdale; "I cannot see you."--"Here!" said\r\nCharles, "you may feel my grip;" and he sprung upon him in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe attack was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, that Marchdale was\r\nthrown backwards, and the dagger wrested from his grasp, during the\r\nfirst impulse which Charles Holland had thrown into his attack.\r\n\r\nMoreover, his head struck with such violence against the earthern floor,\r\nthat it produced a temporary confusion of his faculties, so that, had\r\nCharles Holland been so inclined, he might, with Marchdale\'s own weapon,\r\nhave easily taken his life.\r\n\r\nThe young man did, on the impulse of the moment, raise it in his hand,\r\nbut, on the impulse of another thought, he cast it from him,\r\nexclaiming--\r\n\r\n"No, no! not that; I should be as bad as he, or nearly so. This villain\r\nhas come to murder me, but yet I will not take his life for the deed.\r\nWhat shall I do with him? Ha! a lucky thought--chains!"\r\n\r\nHe dragged Marchdale to the identical spot of earth on which he had lain\r\nso long; and, as Sir Francis Varney had left the key of the padlock\r\nwhich bound the chains together in it, he, in a few moments, had\r\nsucceeded in placing the villain Marchdale in the same durance from\r\nwhich he had himself shortly since escaped.\r\n\r\n"Remain there," he said, "until some one comes to rescue you. I will not\r\nlet you starve to death, but I will give you a long fast; and, when I\r\ncome again, it shall be along with some of the Bannerworth family, to\r\nshow them what a viper they have fostered in their hearts."\r\n\r\nMarchdale was just sufficiently conscious now to feel all the realities\r\nof his situation. In vain he attempted to rise from his prostrate\r\nposition. The chains did their duty, keeping down a villain with the\r\nsame means that they had held in ignominious confinement a true man.\r\n\r\nHe was in a perfect agony, inasmuch as he considered that he would be\r\nallowed to remain there to starve to death, thus achieving for himself a\r\nmore horrible death than any he had ever thought of inflicting.\r\n\r\n"Villain!" exclaimed Charles Holland, "you shall there remain; and, let\r\nyou have what mental sufferings you may, you richly deserve them."\r\n\r\nHe heeded not the cries of Marchdale--he heeded not his imprecations any\r\nmore than he did his prayers; and the arch hypocrite used both in\r\nabundance. Charles was but too happy once more to look upon the open\r\nsky, although it was then in darkness, to heed anything that Marchdale,\r\nin the agony to which he was now reduced, might feel inclined to say;\r\nand, after glancing around him for some few moments, when he was free of\r\nthe ruins, and inhaling with exquisite delight the free air of the\r\nsurrounding meadows, he saw, by the twinkling of the lights, in which\r\ndirection the town lay, and knowing that by taking a line in that path,\r\nand then after a time diverging a little to the right, he should come to\r\nBannerworth Hall, he walked on, never in his whole life probably feeling\r\nsuch an enjoyment of the mere fact of existence as at such a moment as\r\nthat of exquisite liberty.\r\n\r\nOur readers may with us imagine what it is to taste the free, fresh air\r\nof heaven, after being long pent up, as he, Charles Holland, had been,\r\nin a damp, noisome dungeon, teeming with unwholesome exhalations. They\r\nmay well suppose with what an amount of rapture he now found himself\r\nunrestrained in his movements by those galling fetters which had hung\r\nfor so long a period upon his youthful limbs, and which, not\r\nunfrequently in the despair of his heart, he had thought he should\r\nsurely die in.\r\n\r\nAnd last, although not least in his dear esteem, did the rapturous\r\nthought of once more looking in the sweet face of her he loved come\r\ncross him with a gush of delight.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" he exclaimed, as he quickened his pace; "yes! I shall be able to\r\ntell Flora Bannerworth how well and how truly I love her. I shall be\r\nable to tell her that, in my weary and hideous imprisonment, the thought\r\nalone of her has supported me."\r\n\r\nAs he neared the Hall, he quickened his pace to such an extent, that\r\nsoon he was forced to pause altogether, as the exertion he had\r\nundertaken pretty plainly told him that the imprisonment, scanty diet,\r\nand want of exercise, which had been his portion for some time past, had\r\nmost materially decreased his strength.\r\n\r\nHis limbs trembled, and a profuse perspiration bedewed his brow,\r\nalthough the night was rather cold than otherwise.\r\n\r\n"I am very weak," he said; "and much I wonder now that I succeeded in\r\novercoming that villain Marchdale; who, if I had not done so, would most\r\nassuredly have murdered me."\r\n\r\nAnd it was a wonder; for Marchdale was not an old man, although he might\r\nbe considered certainly as past the prime of life, and he was of a\r\nstrong and athletic build. But it was the suddenness of his attack upon\r\nhim which had given Charles Holland the great advantage, and had caused\r\nthe defeat of the ruffian who came bent on one of the most cowardly and\r\ndastardly murders that could be committed--namely, upon an unoffending\r\nman, whom he supposed to be loaded with chains, and incapable of making\r\nthe least efficient resistance.\r\n\r\nCharles soon again recovered sufficient breath and strength to proceed\r\ntowards the Hall, and now warned, by the exhaustion which had come over\r\nhim that he had not really anything like strength enough to allow him to\r\nproceed rapidly, he walked with slow and deliberate steps.\r\n\r\nThis mode of proceeding was more favourable to reflection than the wild,\r\nrapid one which he had at first adopted, and in all the glowing colours\r\nof youthful and ingenious fancy did he depict to himself the surprise\r\nand the pleasure that would beam in the countenance of his beloved Flora\r\nwhen she should find him once again by her side.\r\n\r\nOf course, he, Charles, could know nothing of the contrivances which had\r\nbeen resorted to, and which the reader may lay wholly to the charge of\r\nMarchdale, to blacken his character, and to make him appear faithless to\r\nthe love he had professed.\r\n\r\nHad he known this, it is probable that indignation would have added\r\nwings to his progress, and he would not have been able to proceed at the\r\nleisurely pace he felt that his state of physical weakness dictated to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd now he saw the topmost portion at Bannerworth Hall pushing out from\r\namongst the trees with which the ancient pile was so much surrounded,\r\nand the sight of the home of his beloved revived him, and quickened the\r\ncirculation of the warm blood in his veins.\r\n\r\n"I shall behold her now," he said--"I shall behold her how! A few\r\nminutes more, and I shall hold her to my heart--that heart which has\r\nbeen ever hers, and which carried her image enshrined in its deepest\r\nrecesses, even into the gloom of a dungeon!"\r\n\r\nBut let us, while Charles Holland is indulging in these delightful\r\nanticipations--anticipations which, we regret, in consequence of the\r\ndeparture of the Bannerworths from the Hall, will not be realized so\r\nsoon as he supposes--look back upon the discomfited hypocrite and\r\nvillain, Marchdale, who occupies his place in the dungeon of the old\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nUntil Charles Holland actually had left the strange, horrible, and\r\ncell-like place, he could scarcely make up his mind that the young man\r\nentertained a serious intention of leaving him there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he did not think any one could be so cruel and so wicked as he\r\nhimself; for the reader will no doubt recollect that his, Marchdale\'s,\r\ncounsel to Varney, was to leave Charles Holland to his fate, chained\r\ndown as he was in the dungeon, and that fate would have been the\r\nhorrible one of being starved to death in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nWhen now, however, he felt confident that he was deserted--when he heard\r\nthe sound of Charles Holland\'s retreating footsteps slowly dying away in\r\nthe distance, until not the faintest echo of them reached his ears, he\r\ndespaired indeed; and the horror he experienced during the succeeding\r\nten minutes, might be considered an ample atonement for some of his\r\ncrimes. His brain was in a complete whirl; nothing of a tangible nature,\r\nbut that he was there, chained down, and left to starve to death, came\r\nacross his intellect. Then a kind of madness, for a moment or two, took\r\npossession of him; he made a tremendous effort to burst asunder the\r\nbands that held him.\r\n\r\nBut it was in vain. The chains--which had been placed upon Charles\r\nHolland during the first few days of his confinement, when he had a\r\nlittle recovered from the effects of the violence which had been\r\ncommitted upon him at the time when he was captured--effectually\r\nresisted Marchdale.\r\n\r\nThey even cut into his flesh, inflicting upon him some grievous wounds;\r\nbut that was all he achieved by his great efforts to free himself, so\r\nthat, after a few moments, bleeding and in great pain, he, with a deep\r\ngroan, desisted from the fruitless efforts he had better not have\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThen he remained silent for a time, but it was not the silence of\r\nreflection; it was that of exhaustion, and, as such, was not likely to\r\nlast long; nor did it, for, in the course of another five minutes, he\r\ncalled out loudly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he thought there might be a remote chance that some one\r\ntraversing the meadows would hear him; and yet, if he had duly\r\nconsidered the matter, which he was not in a fitting frame of mind to\r\ndo, he would have recollected that, in choosing a dungeon among the\r\nunderground vaults of these ruins, he had, by experiment, made certain\r\nthat no cry, however loud, from where he lay, could reach the upper air.\r\nAnd thus had this villain, by the very precautions which he had himself\r\ntaken to ensure the safe custody of another, been his own greatest\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n"Help! help! help!" he cried frantically "Varney! Charles Holland! have\r\nmercy upon me, and do not leave me here to starve! Help, oh, Heaven!\r\nCurses on all your heads--curses! Oh, mercy--mercy--mercy!"\r\n\r\nIn suchlike incoherent expressions did he pass some hours, until, what\r\nwith exhaustion and a raging thirst that came over him, he could not\r\nutter another word, but lay the very picture of despair and discomfited\r\nmalice and wickedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nFLORA BANNERWORTH AND HER MOTHER.--THE EPISODE OF CHIVALRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGladly we turn from such a man as Marchdale to a consideration of the\r\nbeautiful and accomplished Flora Bannerworth, to whom we may, without\r\ndestroying in any way the interest of our plot, predict a much happier\r\ndestiny than, probably, at that time, she considers as at all likely to\r\nbe hers.\r\n\r\nShe certainly enjoyed, upon her first removal from Bannerworth Hall,\r\ngreater serenity of mind than she had done there; but, as we have\r\nalready remarked of her, the more her mind was withdrawn, by change of\r\nscene, from the horrible considerations which the attack of the vampyre\r\nhad forced upon her, the more she reverted to the fate of Charles\r\nHolland, which was still shrouded in so much gloom.\r\n\r\nShe would sit and converse with her mother upon that subject until she\r\nworked up her feelings to a most uncomfortable pitch of excitement, and\r\nthen Mrs. Bannerworth would get her younger brother to join them, who\r\nwould occasionally read to her some compositions of his own, or of some\r\nfavourite writer whom he thought would amuse her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was on the very evening when Sir Francis Varney had made up his mind\r\nto release Charles Holland, that young Bannerworth read to his sister\r\nand his mother the following little chivalric incident, which he told\r\nthem he had himself collated from authentic sources:--\r\n\r\n"The knight with the green shield," exclaimed one of a party of\r\nmen-at-arms, who were drinking together at an ancient hostel, not far\r\nfrom Shrewsbury--"the knight with the green shield is as good a knight\r\nas ever buckled on a sword, or wore spurs."--"Then how comes it he is\r\nnot one of the victors in the day\'s tournament?" exclaimed another.--"By\r\nthe bones of Alfred!" said a third, "a man must be judged of by his\r\ndeserts, and not by the partiality of his friends. That\'s my opinion,\r\nfriends."--"And mine, too," said another.\r\n\r\n"That is all very true, and my opinion would go with yours, too; but not\r\nin this instance. Though you may accuse me of partiality, yet I am not\r\nso; for I have seen some of the victors of to-day by no means forward in\r\nthe press of battle-men who, I will not say feared danger, but who liked\r\nit not so well but they avoided it as much as possible."\r\n\r\n"Ay, marry, and so have I. The reason is, \'tis much easier to face a\r\nblunted lance, than one with a spear-head; and a man may practise the\r\none and thrive in it, but not the other; for the best lance in the\r\ntournament is not always the best arm in the battle."\r\n\r\n"And that is the reason of my saying the knight with the green shield\r\nwas a good knight. I have seen him in the midst of the melee, when men\r\nand horses have been hurled to the ground by the shock; there he has\r\nbehaved himself like a brave knight, and has more than once been noticed\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n"But how canne he to be so easily overthrown to-day? That speaks\r\nsomething."--"His horse is an old one."\r\n\r\n"So much the better," said another; "he\'s used to his work, and as\r\ncunning as an old man."--"But he has been wounded more than once, and is\r\nweakened very much: besides, I saw him lose his footing, else he had\r\noverthrown his opponent.\r\n\r\n"He did not seem distressed about his accident, at all events, but sat\r\ncontented in the tent."--"He knows well that those who know him will\r\nnever attribute his misadventure either to want of courage or conduct;\r\nmoreover, he seems to be one of those who care but little for the\r\nopinion of men who care nothing for him."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s right. Well, dear comrades, the health of Green Knight, or the\r\nKnight with a Green Shield, for that\'s his name, or the designation he\r\nchooses to go by."--"A health to the Knight with the Green Shield!"\r\nshouted the men-at-arms, as they lifted their cups on high.\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" inquired one of the men-at-arms, of him who had spoken\r\nfavourably of the stranger.--"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And yet you spoke favourably of him a few seconds back, and said what a\r\nbrave knight he was!"--"And so I uphold him to be; but, I tell you what,\r\nfriend, I would do as much for the greatest stranger I ever met. I have\r\nseen him fight where men and horses have bit the dust in hundreds; and\r\nthat, in my opinion, speaks out for the man and warrior; he who cannot,\r\nthen, fight like a soldier, had better tilt at home in the castle-yard,\r\nand there win ladies\' smiles, but not the commendation of the leader of\r\nthe battle."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true: I myself recollect very well Sir Hugh de Colbert, a very\r\naccomplished knight in the castle-yard; but his men were as fine a set\r\nof fellows as ever crossed a horse, to look at, but they proved\r\ndeficient at the moment of trial; they were broken, and fled in a\r\nmoment, and scarce one of them received a scratch."\r\n\r\n"Then they hadn\'t stood the shock of the foeman?"--"No; that\'s certain."\r\n\r\n"But still I should like to know the knight,--to know his name very\r\nwell."--"I know it not; he has some reason for keeping it secret, I\r\nsuppose; but his deeds will not shame it, be it what it may. I can bear\r\nwitness to more than one foeman falling beneath his battle-axe."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"--"Yes; and he took a banner from the enemy in the last battle\r\nthat was fought."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well! he deserves a better fortune to-morrow. Who is to be the\r\nbridegroom of the beautiful Bertha, daughter of Lord de Cauci?"--"That\r\nwill have to be decided: but it is presumed that Sir Guthrie de Beaumont\r\nis the intended."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but should he not prove the victor?"--"It\'s understood; because\r\nit\'s known he is intended by the parents of the lady, and none would be\r\nungallant enough to prevail against him,--save on such conditions as\r\nwould not endanger the fruits of victory."\r\n\r\n"No?"--"Certainly not; they would lay the trophies at the foot of the\r\nbeauty worshipped by the knights at the tournament."\r\n\r\n"So, triumphant or not, he\'s to be the bridegroom; bearing off the prize\r\nof valour whether or no,--in fact, deserve her or not,--that\'s the\r\nfact."--"So it is, so it is."\r\n\r\n"And a shame, too, friends; but so it is now; but yet, if the knight\'s\r\nhorse recovers from the strain, and is fit for work to-morrow, it\r\nstrikes me that the Green Shield will give some work to the holiday\r\nknight."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere had been a grand tournament held near Shrewsbury Castle, in honour\r\nof the intended nuptials of the beautiful Lady Bertha de Cauci. She was\r\nthe only daughter of the Earl de Cauci, a nobleman of some note; he was\r\none of an ancient and unblemished name, and of great riches.\r\n\r\nThe lady was beautiful, but, at the same time, she was an unwilling\r\nbride,--every one could see that; but the bridegroom cared not for that.\r\nThere was a sealed sorrow on her brow,--a sorrow that seemed sincere and\r\nlasting; but she spoke not of it to any one,--her lips were seldom\r\nparted. She loved another. Yes; she loved one who was far away, fighting\r\nin the wars of his country,--one who was not so rich in lands as her\r\npresent bridegroom.\r\n\r\nWhen he left her, she remembered his promise; it was, to fight on till\r\nhe earned a fortune, or name that should give him some right to claim\r\nher hand, even from her imperious father. But alas! he came not; and\r\nwhat could she do against the commands of one who would be obeyed? Her\r\nmother, too, was a proud, haughty woman, one whose sole anxiety was to\r\nincrease the grandeur and power of her house by such connections.\r\n\r\nThus it was pressed on by circumstances, she could no longer hold out,\r\nmore especially as she heard nothing of her knight. She knew not where\r\nhe was, or indeed if he were living or dead. She knew not he was never\r\nnamed. This last circumstance, indeed, gave her pain; for it assured her\r\nthat he whom she loved had been unable to signalize himself from among\r\nother men. That, in fact, he was unknown in the annals of fame, as well\r\nas the probability that he had been slain in some of the earlier\r\nskirmishes of the war. This, if it had happened, caused her some pain to\r\nthink upon; not but such events were looked upon with almost\r\nindifference by females, save in such cases where their affections were\r\nengaged, as on this occasion. But the event was softened by the fact\r\nthat men were continually falling by the hand of man in such encounters,\r\nbut at the same time it was considered an honourable and praiseworthy\r\ndeath for a soldier. He was wounded, but not with the anguish we now\r\nhear of; for the friends were consoled by the reflection that the\r\ndeceased warrior died covered with glory.\r\n\r\nBertha, however, was young, and as yet she knew not the cause of her\r\nabsent knight\'s silence, or why he had not been heard of among the most\r\nforward in the battle.\r\n\r\n"Heaven\'s will be done," she exclaimed; "what can I do? I must submit to\r\nmy father\'s behests; but my future life will be one of misery and\r\nsorrow."\r\n\r\nShe wept to think of the past, and to dream of the future; both alike\r\nwere sorrowful to think upon--no comfort in the past and no joy in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThus she wept and sorrowed on the night of the first tournament; there\r\nwas to be a second, and that was to be the grand one, where her intended\r\nbridegroom was to show himself off in her eyes, and take his part in the\r\nsport.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBertha sat late--she sat sorrowing by the light of the lamps and the\r\nflickering flame of the fire, as it rose and fell on the hearth and\r\nthrew dancing shadows on the walls.\r\n\r\n"Oh, why, Arthur Home, should you thus be absent? Absent, too, at such a\r\ntime when you are more needed than ever. Alas, alas! you may no longer\r\nbe in the land of the living. Your family is great and your name\r\nknown--your own has been spoken with commendation from the lips of your\r\nfriend; what more of fame do you need? but I am speaking without\r\npurpose. Heaven have mercy on me."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she looked up and saw one of her women in waiting standing\r\nby.\r\n\r\n"Well, what would you?"--"My lady, there is one who would speak with\r\nyou," said the hand-maiden.\r\n\r\n"With me?"--"Yes, my lady; he named you the Lady Bertha de Cauci."\r\n\r\n"Who and what is he?" she inquired, with something like trepidation, of\r\nthe maiden.--"I know not, my lady."\r\n\r\n"But gave he not some token by which I might know who I admit to my\r\nchamber?"--"None," replied the maiden.\r\n\r\n"And what does he bear by way of distinguishing himself? What crest or\r\ndevice doth he bear?"--"Merely a green shield."\r\n\r\n"The unsuccessful knight in the tournament to-day. Heaven\'s! what can he\r\ndesire with me; he is not--no, no, it cannot be--it cannot be."--"Will\r\nyou admit him, lady?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I know not what to do; but yet he may have some intelligence to\r\ngive me. Yes, yes, admit him; but first throw some logs on the fire."\r\n\r\nThe attendant did as she was desired, and then quitted the room for the\r\npurpose of admitting the stranger knight with the green shield. In a few\r\nmoments she could hear the stride of the knight as he entered the\r\napartment, and she thought the step was familiar to her ear--she thought\r\nit was the step of Sir Arthur Home, her lover. She waited anxiously to\r\nsee the door open, and then the stranger entered. His form and bearing\r\nwas that of her lover, but his visor was down, and she was unable to\r\ndistinguish the features of the stranger.\r\n\r\nHis armour was such as had seen many a day\'s hard wear, and there were\r\nplenty of marks of the battle about him. His travel-worn accoutrements\r\nwere altogether such as bespoke service in the field.\r\n\r\n"Sir, you desired to see me; say wherefore you do so, and if it is news\r\nyou bring." The knight answered not, but pointed to the female\r\nattendant, as if he desired she would withdraw. "You may retire," said\r\nBertha; "be within call, and let me know if I am threatened with\r\ninterruption."\r\n\r\nThe attendant retired, and then the knight and lady were left alone. The\r\nformer seemed at a loss how to break silence for some moments, and then\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"Lady ----" "Oh, Heavens! \'tis he!" exclaimed Bertha, as she sprang to\r\nher feet; "it is Sir Arthur Home!"\r\n\r\n"It is," exclaimed the knight, pulling up his visor, and dropping on one\r\nknee he encircled his arm round the waist of the lady, and at the same\r\nmoment he pressed her lips to his own.\r\n\r\nThe first emotion of joy and surprise over, Bertha checked her\r\ntransports, and chid the knight for his boldness.\r\n\r\n"Nay, chide me not, dear Bertha; I am what I was when I left you, and\r\nhope to find you the same."\r\n\r\n"Am I not?" said Bertha.--"Truly I know not, for you seem more beautiful\r\nthan you were then; I hope that is the only change."\r\n\r\n"If there be a change, it is only such as you see. Sorrow and regret\r\nform the principal causes."--"I understand you."\r\n\r\n"My intended nuptials ----" "Yes, I have heard all. I came here but\r\nlate in the morning; and my horse was jaded and tired, and my impatience\r\nto attend the tournament caused me a disaster which it is well it came not\r\non the second day."\r\n\r\n"It is, dear Arthur. How is it I never heard your name mentioned, or\r\nthat I received no news from any one about you during the wars that have\r\nended?"--"I had more than one personal enemy, Bertha; men who would have\r\nbeen glad to see me fall, and who, in default of that, would not have\r\nminded bribing an assassin to secure my death for them at any risk\r\nwhatever."\r\n\r\n"Heavens! and how did you escape such a death from such people,\r\nArthur?"--"By adopting such a device as that I wear. The Knight of the\r\nGreen Shield I\'m called."\r\n\r\n"I saw you to-day in the tournament."--"And there my tired and jaded\r\nhorse gave way; but to-morrow I shall have, I hope, a different\r\nfortune."\r\n\r\n"I hope so too."--"I will try; my arm has been good in battle, and I\r\nsee not why it should be deficient in peaceful jousts."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. What fortune have you met with since you left\r\nEngland?"--"I was of course known but to a few; among those few were the\r\ngeneral under whom I served and my more immediate officers, who I knew\r\nwould not divulge my secret."\r\n\r\n"And they did not?"--"No; kept it nobly, and kept their eyes upon me in\r\nbattle; and I have reaped a rich harvest in force, honour, and riches, I\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" said Bertha.--"Bertha, if I be conqueror, may I claim\r\nyou in the court-yard before all the spectators?"\r\n\r\n"You may," said Bertha, and she hung her head.--"Moreover," said Sir\r\nArthur, "you will not make a half promise, but when I demand you, you\r\nwill at once come down to me and accept me as your husband; if I be the\r\nvictor then he cannot object to the match."\r\n\r\n"But he will have many friends, and his intended bride will have many\r\nmore, so that you may run some danger among so many enemies."--"Never\r\nfear for me, Bertha, because I shall have many friends of distinction\r\nthere too--many old friends who are tried men in battle, and whose deeds\r\nare a glory and honour to them; besides, I shall have my commander and\r\nseveral gentlemen who would at once interfere in case any unfair\r\nadvantage was attempted to be taken of my supposed weakness."\r\n\r\n"Have you a fresh horse?" inquired Bertha.--"I have, or shall have by\r\nthe morning; but promise me you will do what I ask you, and then my arm\r\nwill be nerved to its utmost, and I am sure to be victorious."\r\n\r\n"I do promise," said Bertha; "I hope you may be as successful as you\r\nhope to be, Arthur; but suppose fortune should declare against you;\r\nsuppose an accident of any kind were to happen, what could be done\r\nthen?"--"I must be content to hide myself for ever afterwards, as a\r\ndefeated knight; how can I appear before your friends as the claimant of\r\nyour hand?"\r\n\r\n"I will never have any other."--"But you will be forced to accept this\r\nGuthrie de Beaumont, your father\'s chosen son-in-law."\r\n\r\n"I will seek refuge in a cloister."--"Will you fly with me, Bertha, to\r\nsome sequestered spot, where we can live in each others society?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bertha, "anything, save marriage with Guthrie de\r\nBeaumont."--"Then await the tournament of to-morrow," said Sir Arthur,\r\n"and then this may be avoided; in the meantime, keep up a good heart and\r\nremember I am at hand."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese two lovers parted for the present, after a protracted interview,\r\nBertha to her chamber, and the Knight of the Green Shield to his tent.\r\n\r\nThe following morning was one of great preparation; the lists had been\r\nenlarged, and the seats made more commodious, for the influx of visitors\r\nappeared to be much greater than had been anticipated.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were many old warriors of distinction to be present,\r\nwhich made the bridegroom look pale and feel uncomfortable as to the\r\nresults of the tournament. The tilting was to begin at an early hour,\r\nand then the feasting and revelry would begin early in the evening,\r\nafter the tilting had all passed off.\r\n\r\nIn that day\'s work there were many thrown from their saddles, and many\r\nbroke their lances. The bridegroom tilted with several knights, and came\r\noff victorious, or without disadvantage to either.\r\n\r\nThe green knight, on the contrary, tilted with but few, and always\r\nvictorious, and such matches were with men who had been men of some name\r\nin the wars, or at least in the tilt yard.\r\n\r\nThe sports drew to a close, and when the bridegroom became the\r\nchallenger, the Knight of the Green Shield at once rode out quietly to\r\nmeet him. The encounter could not well be avoided, and the bridegroom\r\nwould willingly have declined the joust with a knight who had disposed\r\nof his enemies so easily, and so unceremoniously as he had.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter was enough; the bridegroom was thrown to a great\r\ndistance, and lay insensible on the ground, and was carried out of the\r\nfield. There was an immediate sensation among the friends of the\r\nbridegroom, several of whom rode out to challenge the stranger knight\r\nfor his presumption.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, they had misreckoned the chances, for the challenged\r\naccepted their challenges with alacrity and disposed of them one by one\r\nwith credit to himself until the day was concluded. The stranger was\r\nthen asked to declare who he was, upon which he lifted his visor, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n"I am Sir Arthur Home, and claim the Lady Bertha as my bride, by the\r\nlaws of arms, and by those of love."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the tent was felled, and again the hostelry was tenanted by the\r\nsoldier, who declared for one side and then for the other, as the cups\r\nclanged and jingled together.\r\n\r\n"Said I not," exclaimed one of the troopers, "that the knight with a\r\ngreen shield was a good knight?"--"You did," replied the other.\r\n\r\n"And you knew who he was?" said another of the troopers.--"Not I,\r\ncomrades; I had seen him fight in battle, and, therefore, partly guessed\r\nhow it would be if he had any chance with the bridegroom. I\'m glad he\r\nhas won the lady."\r\n\r\nIt was true, the Lady Bertha was won, and Sir Arthur Home claimed his\r\nbride, and then they attempted to defeat his claim; yet Bertha at once\r\nexpressed herself in his favour, to strongly that they were, however\r\nreluctantly compelled, to consent at last.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a loud shout as from a multitude of persons came upon\r\ntheir ears and Flora started from her seat in alarm. The cause of the\r\nalarm we shall proceed to detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNERAL OF THE STRANGER OF THE INN.--THE POPULAR COMMOTION, AND MRS.\r\nCHILLINGWORTH\'S APPEAL TO THE MOB.--THE NEW RIOT.--THE HALL IN DANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs yet the town was quiet; and, though there was no appearance of riot\r\nor disturbance, yet the magistracy had taken every precaution they\r\ndeemed needful, or their position and necessities warranted, to secure\r\nthe peace of the town from the like disturbance to that which had been,\r\nof late, a disgrace and terror of peaceably-disposed persons.\r\n\r\nThe populace were well advertised of the fact, that the body of the\r\nstranger was to be buried that morning in their churchyard; and that, to\r\nprotect the body, should there be any necessity for so doing, a large\r\nbody of constables would be employed.\r\n\r\nThere was no disposition to riot; at least, none was visible. It looked\r\nas if there was some event about to take place that was highly\r\ninteresting to all parties, who were peaceably assembling to witness the\r\ninterment of nobody knew who.\r\n\r\nThe early hour at which persons were assembling, at different points,\r\nclearly indicated that there was a spirit of curiosity about the town,\r\nso uncommon that none would have noticed it but for the fact of the\r\ncrowd of people who hung about the streets, and there remained, listless\r\nand impatient.\r\n\r\nThe inn, too, was crowded with visitors, and there were many who, not\r\nbeing blessed with the strength of purse that some were, were hanging\r\nabout in the distance, waiting and watching the motions of those who\r\nwere better provided.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said one of the visitors, "this is a disagreeable job in your\r\nhouse, landlord."--"Yes, sir; I\'d sooner it had happened elsewhere, I\r\nassure you. I know it has done me no good."\r\n\r\n"No; no man could expect any, and yet it is none the less unfortunate\r\nfor that."--"I would sooner anything else happen than that, whatever it\r\nmight be. I think it must be something very bad, at all events; but I\r\ndare say I shall never see the like again."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for the town," said another; "for, what with\r\nvampyres and riots, there has been but little else stirring than\r\nmischief and disturbances of one kind and another."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and, what between Varneys and Bannerworths, we have had but little\r\npeace here."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. Do you know it\'s my opinion that the least thing would upset\r\nthe whole town. Any one unlucky word would do it, I am sure," said a\r\ntall thin man.\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt of it," said another; "but I hope the military would do\r\ntheir duty under such circumstances, for people\'s lives and property are\r\nnot safe in such a state of things."--"Oh, dear no."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what has become of Varney, or where he can have gone\r\nto."--"Some thought he must have been burned when they burned his\r\nhouse," replied the landlord.\r\n\r\n"But I believe it generally understood he\'s escaped, has he not? No\r\ntraces of his body were found in the ruins."--"None. Oh! he\'s escaped,\r\nthere can be no doubt of that. I wish I had some fortune depending upon\r\nthe fact; it would be mine, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Well, the lord keep us from vampyres and suchlike cattle," said an old\r\nwoman. "I shall never sleep again in my bed with any safety. It\r\nfrightens one out of one\'s life to think of it. What a shame the men\r\ndidn\'t catch him and stake him!"\r\n\r\nThe old woman left the inn as soon as she had spoke this Christian\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n"Humane!" said a gentleman, with a sporting coat on. "The old woman is\r\nno advocate for half measures!"\r\n\r\n"You are right, sir," said the landlord; "and a very good look-out she\r\nkeeps upon the pot, to see it\'s full, and carefully blows the froth\r\noff!"--"Ah! I thought as much."\r\n\r\n"How soon will the funeral take place, landlord?" inquired a person, who\r\nhad at that moment entered the inn.--"In about an hour\'s time, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the town seems pretty full, though it is very quiet. I suppose it\r\nis more as a matter of curiosity people congregate to see the funeral of\r\nthis stranger?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so, sir."\r\n\r\n"The time is wearing on, and if they don\'t make a dust, why then the\r\nmilitary will not be troubled."\r\n\r\n"I do not expect anything more, sir," said the landlord; "for you see\r\nthey must have had their swing out, as the saying is, and be fully\r\nsatisfied. They cannot have much more to do in the way of exhibiting\r\ntheir anger or dislike to vampyres--they all have done enough."\r\n\r\n"So they have--so they have."\r\n\r\n"Granted," said an old man with a troublesome cough; "but when did you\r\never know a mob to be satisfied? If they wanted the moon and got it,\r\nthey\'d find out it would be necessary to have the stars also."\r\n\r\n"That\'s uncommonly true," said the landlord. "I shouldn\'t be surprised\r\nif they didn\'t do something worse than ever."--"Nothing more likely,"\r\nsaid the little old man. "I can believe anything of a mob--anything--no\r\nmatter what."\r\n\r\nThe inn was crowded with visitors, and several extra hands were employed\r\nto wait upon the customers, and a scene of bustle and activity was\r\ndisplayed that was never before seen. It would glad the heart of a\r\nlandlord, though he were made of stone, and landlords are usually of\r\nmuch more malleable materials than that.\r\n\r\nHowever, the landlord had hardly time to congratulate himself, for the\r\nbearers were come now, and the undertaker and his troop of\r\ndeath-following officials.\r\n\r\nThere was a stir among the people, who began now to awaken from the\r\nlethargy that seemed to have come over them while they were waiting for\r\nthe moment when it should arrive, that was to place the body under the\r\ngreen sod, against which so much of their anger had been raised. There\r\nwas a decent silence that pervaded the mob of individuals who had\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nDeath, with all its ghastly insignia, had an effect even upon the\r\nunthinking multitude, who were ever ready to inflict death or any\r\nviolent injury upon any object that came in their way--they never\r\nhesitated; but even these, now the object of their hatred was no more,\r\nfelt appalled.\r\n\r\n\'Tis strange what a change comes over masses of men as they gaze upon a\r\ndead body. It may be that they all know that to that complexion they\r\nmust come at last. This may be the secret of the respect offered to the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe undertakers are men, however, who are used to the presence of\r\ndeath--it is their element; they gain a living by attending upon the\r\nlast obsequies of the dead; they are used to dead bodies, and care not\r\nfor them. Some of them are humane men, that is, in their way; and even\r\namong them are men who wouldn\'t be deprived of the joke as they screwed\r\ndown the last screw. They could not forbear, even on this occasion, to\r\nhold their converse when left alone.\r\n\r\n"Jacobs," said one who was turning a long screw, "Jacobs, my boy, do you\r\ntake the chair to-night?"--"Yes," said Jacobs who was a long\r\nlugubrious-looking man, "I do take the chair, if I live over this\r\nblessed event."\r\n\r\n"You are not croaking, Jacobs, are you? Well, you are a lively customer,\r\nyou are."--"Lively--do you expect people to be lively when they are full\r\ndressed for a funeral? You are a nice article for your profession. You\r\ndon\'t feel like an undertaker, you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Jacobs, my boy. As long as I look like one when occasion\r\ndemands; when I have done my job I puts my comfort in my pocket, and\r\nthinks how much more pleasanter it is to be going to other people\'s\r\nfunerals than to our own, and then only see the difference as regards\r\nthe money."\r\n\r\n"True," said Jacobs with a groan; "but death\'s a melancholy article, at\r\nall events."--"So it is."\r\n\r\n"And then when you come to consider the number of people we have\r\nburied--how many have gone to their last homes--and how many more will\r\ngo the same way."--"Yes, yes; that\'s all very well, Jacob. You are\r\nprecious surly this morning. I\'ll come to-night. You\'re brewing a\r\nsentimental tale as sure as eggs is eggs."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is pretty certain; but as I was saying how many more are\r\nthere--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t bother yourself with calculations that have neither beginning\r\nnor end, and which haven\'t one point to go. Come, Jacob, have you\r\nfinished yet?"--"Quite," said Jacob.\r\n\r\nThey now arranged the pall, and placed all in readiness, and returned to\r\na place down stairs where they could enjoy themselves for an odd half\r\nhour, and pass that time away until the moment should arrive when his\r\nreverence would be ready to bury the deceased, upon consideration of the\r\nfees to be paid upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe tap-room was crowded, and there was no room for the men, and they\r\nwere taken into the kitchen, where they were seated, and earnestly at\r\nwork, preparing for the ceremony that had so shortly to be performed.\r\n\r\n"Any better, Jacobs?"--"What do you mean?" inquired Jacobs, with a\r\ngroan. "It\'s news to me if I have been ill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you were doleful up stairs, you know."--"I\'ve a proper regard\r\nfor my profession--that\'s the difference between you and I, you know."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wager you what you like, now, that I\'ll handle a corpse and drive\r\na screw in a coffin as well as you, now, although you are so solid and\r\nmiserable."--"So you may--so you may."\r\n\r\n"Then what do you mean by saying I haven\'t a proper regard for my\r\nprofession?"--"I say you haven\'t, and there\'s the thing that shall prove\r\nit--you don\'t look it, and that\'s the truth."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t look like an undertaker! indeed I dare say I don\'t if I ain\'t\r\ndressed like one."--"Nor when you are," reiterated Jacob.\r\n\r\n"Why not, pray?"--"Because you have always a grin on your face as broad\r\nas a gridiron--that\'s why."\r\n\r\nThis ended the dispute, for the employer of the men suddenly put his\r\nhead in, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Come, now, time\'s up; you are wanted up stairs, all of you. Be quick;\r\nwe shall have his reverence waiting for us, and then we shall lose his\r\nrecommendation."\r\n\r\n"Ready sir," said the round man, taking up his pint and finishing it off\r\nat a draught, at the same moment he thrust the remains of some bread and\r\ncheese into his pocket.\r\n\r\nJacob, too, took his pot, and, having finished it, with great gravity\r\nfollowed the example of his more jocose companion, and they all left the\r\nkitchen for the room above, where the corpse was lying ready for\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nThere was an unusual bustle; everybody was on the tip-top of\r\nexpectation, and awaiting the result in a quiet hurry, and hoped to have\r\nthe first glimpse of the coffin, though why they should do so it was\r\ndifficult to define. But in this fit of mysterious hope and expectation\r\nthey certainly stood.\r\n\r\n"Will they be long?" inquired a man at the door of one inside,--"will\r\nthey be long before they come?"--"They are coming now," said the man.\r\n"Do you all keep quiet; they are knocking their heads against the top of\r\nthe landing. Hark! There, I told you so."\r\n\r\nThe man departed, hearing something, and being satisfied that he had got\r\nsome information.\r\n\r\n"Now, then," said the landlord, "move out of the way, and allow the\r\ncorpse to pass out. Let me have no indecent conduct; let everything be\r\nas it should be."\r\n\r\nThe people soon removed from the passage and vicinity of the doorway,\r\nand then the mournful procession--as the newspapers have it--moved\r\nforward. They were heard coming down stairs, and thence along the\r\npassage, until they came to the street, and then the whole number of\r\nattendants was plainly discernible.\r\n\r\nHow different was the funeral of one who had friends. He was alone; none\r\nfollowed, save the undertaker and his attendants, all of whom looked\r\nsolemn from habit and professional motives. Even the jocose man was as\r\nsupernaturally solemn as could be well imagined; indeed, nobody knew he\r\nwas the same man.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the landlord, as he watched them down the street, as they\r\nslowly paced their way with funereal, not sorrowful, solemnity--"well, I\r\nam very glad that it is all over."\r\n\r\n"It has been a sad plague to you," said one.\r\n\r\n"It has, indeed; it must be to any one who has had another such a job as\r\nthis. I don\'t say it out of any disrespect to the poor man who is dead\r\nand gone--quite the reverse; but I would not have such another affair on\r\nmy hands for pounds."\r\n\r\n"I can easily believe you, especially when we come to consider the\r\ndisagreeables of a mob."\r\n\r\n"You may say that. There\'s no knowing what they will or won\'t do,\r\nconfound them! If they\'d act like men, and pay for what they have, why,\r\nthen I shouldn\'t care much about them; but it don\'t do to have other\r\npeople in the bar."\r\n\r\n"I should think not, indeed; that would alter the scale of your profits,\r\nI reckon."\r\n\r\n"It would make all the difference to me. Business," added the landlord,\r\n"conducted on that scale, would become a loss; and a man might as well\r\nwalk into a well at once."\r\n\r\n"So I should say. Have many such occurrences as these been usual in this\r\npart of the country?" inquired the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Not usual at all," said the landlord; "but the fact is, the whole\r\nneighbourhood has run distracted about some superhuman being they call a\r\nvampyre."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"--"Yes; and they suspected the unfortunate man who has been\r\nlying up-stairs, a corpse, for some days."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the man they have just taken in the coffin to bury?" said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, the same."\r\n\r\n"Well, I thought perhaps somebody of great consequence had suddenly\r\nbecome defunct."--"Oh, dear no; it would not have caused half the\r\nsensation; people have been really mad."\r\n\r\n"It was a strange occurrence, altogether, I believe, was it?" inquired\r\nthe stranger.--"Indeed it was, sir. I hardly know the particulars, there\r\nhave been so many tales afloat; though they all concur in one point, and\r\nthat is, it has destroyed the peace of one family."\r\n\r\n"Who has done so?"--"The vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I never heard of such an animal, save as a fable, before; it\r\nseems to me extraordinary."\r\n\r\n"So it would do to any one, sir, as was not on the spot, to see it; I\'m\r\nsure I wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the procession, short as it was of itself, moved along\r\nin slow time through a throng of people who ran out of their houses on\r\neither side of the way, and lined the whole length of the town.\r\n\r\nMany of these closed in behind, and followed the mourners until they\r\nwere near the church, and then they made a rush to get into the\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\nAs yet all had been conducted with tolerable propriety, the funeral met\r\nwith no impediment. The presence of death among so many of them seemed\r\nsome check upon the licence of the mob, who bowed in silence to the\r\nmajesty of death.\r\n\r\nWho could bear ill-will against him who was now no more? Man, while he\r\nis man, is always the subject of hatred, fear, or love. Some one of\r\nthese passions, in a modified state, exists in all men, and with such\r\nfeelings they will regard each other; and it is barely possible that any\r\none should not be the object of some of these, and hence the stranger\'s\r\ncorpse was treated with respect.\r\n\r\nIn silence the body proceeded along the highway until it came to the\r\nchurchyard, and followed by an immense multitude of people of all\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nThe authorities trembled; they knew not what all this portended. They\r\nthought it might pass off; but it might become a storm first; they hoped\r\nand feared by turns, till some of them fell sick with apprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence observed by all those in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the coffin, but those farther in the rear found full expression for\r\ntheir feelings.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," said an old man to another, "that he will come to life\r\nagain, eh?"--"Oh, yes, vampyres always do, and lay in the moonlight, and\r\nthen they come to life again. Moonlight recovers a vampyre to life\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"And yet the moonlight is cold."--"Ah, but who\'s to tell what may happen\r\nto a vampyre, or what\'s hot or what\'s cold?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; oh, dear, no."--"And then they have permission to suck\r\nthe blood of other people, to live themselves, and to make other people\r\nvampyres, too."\r\n\r\n"The lord have mercy upon us!"--"Ay, but they have driven a stake\r\nthrough this one, and he can\'t get in moonlight or daylight; it\'s all\r\nover--he\'s certainly done for; we may congratulate ourselves on this\r\npoint."\r\n\r\n"So we may--so we may."\r\n\r\nThey now neared the grave, the clergyman officiating as usual on such\r\noccasions. There was a large mob of persons on all sides, with serious\r\nfaces, watching the progress of the ceremony, and who listened in\r\nquietness.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of any disturbance amongst the people, and the\r\nauthorities were well pleased; they congratulated themselves upon the\r\nquietness and orderliness of the assemblage.\r\n\r\nThe service was ended and the coffin lowered, and the earth was thrown\r\non the coffin-lid with a hollow sound. Nobody could hear that sound\r\nunmoved. But in a short while the sound ceased as the grave became\r\nfilled; it was then trodden carefully down.\r\n\r\nThere were no relatives there to feel affected at the last scene of all.\r\nThey were far away, and, according to popular belief upon the subject,\r\nthey must have been dead some ages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mob watched the last shovel-full of earth thrown upon the coffin,\r\nand witnessed the ramming down of the soil, and the heaping of it over\r\nat top to make the usual monument; for all this was done speedily and\r\ncarefully, lest there should be any tendency to exhume the body of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nThe people were now somewhat relieved, as to their state of solemnity\r\nand silence. They would all of them converse freely on the matter that\r\nhad so long occupied their thoughts.\r\n\r\nThey seemed now let loose, and everybody found himself at liberty to say\r\nor do something, no matter if it were not very reasonable; that is not\r\nalways required of human beings who have souls, or, at least it is\r\nunexpected; and were it expected, the expectation would never be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThe day was likely to wear away without a riot, nay, even without a\r\nfight; a most extraordinary occurrence for such a place under the\r\nexisting circumstances; for of late the populace, or, perhaps, the\r\ntownspeople, were extremely pugnacious, and many were the disputes that\r\nwere settled by the very satisfactory application of the knuckles to the\r\nhead of the party holding a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nThus it was they were ready to take fire, and a hubbub would be the\r\nresult of the slightest provocation. But, on the present occasion, there\r\nwas a remarkable dearth of, all subjects of the nature described.\r\n\r\nWho was to lead Israel out to battle? Alas! no one on the present\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nSuch a one, however, appeared, at least, one who furnished a ready\r\nexcuse for a disturbance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Mrs Chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse\r\nof people. She had just left her house, which was close at hand, her\r\neyes red with weeping, and her children around her on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe crowd made way for her, and gathered round her to see what was going\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\n"Friends and neighbours," she said "can any of you relieve the tears of\r\na distressed wife and mother, have any of you seen anything of my\r\nhusband, Mr. Chillingworth?"\r\n\r\n"What the doctor?" exclaimed one.--"Yes; Mr. Chillingworth, the surgeon.\r\nHe has not been home two days and a night. I\'m distracted!--what can\r\nhave become of him I don\'t know, unless--"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Chillingworth paused, and some person said,--\r\n\r\n"Unless what, Mrs Chillingworth? there are none but friends here, who\r\nwish the doctor well, and would do anything to serve him--unless what?\r\nspeak out."\r\n\r\n"Unless he\'s been destroyed by the vampyre. Heaven knows what we may all\r\ncome to! Here am I and my children deprived of our protector by some\r\nmeans which we cannot imagine. He never, in all his life, did the same\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"He must have been spirited away by some of the vampyres. I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat, friend," said one to another, "that something must be done;\r\nnobody\'s safe in their bed."\r\n\r\n"No; they are not, indeed. I think that all vampyres ought to be burned\r\nand a stake run through them, and then we should be safe."\r\n\r\n"Ay; but you must destroy all those who are even suspected of being\r\nvampyres, or else one may do all the mischief."--"So he might."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob. "Chillingworth for ever! We\'ll find the\r\ndoctor somewhere, if we pull down the whole town."\r\n\r\nThere was an immense commotion among the populace, who began to start\r\nthrowing stones, and do all sorts of things without any particular\r\nobject, and some, as they said, to find the doctor, or to show how\r\nwilling they were to do so if they knew how.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chillingworth, however, kept on talking to the mob, who continued\r\nshouting; and the authorities anticipated an immediate outbreak of\r\npopular opinion, which is generally accompanied by some forcible\r\ndemonstration, and on this occasion some one suggested the propriety of\r\nburning down Bannerworth Hall; because they had burned down the\r\nvampyre\'s home, and they might as well burn down that of the injured\r\nparty, which was carried by acclamation; and with loud shouts they\r\nstarted on their errand.\r\n\r\nThis was a mob\'s proceeding all over, and we regret very much to say,\r\nthat it is very much the characteristic of English mobs. What an\r\nuncommonly strange thing it is that people in multitudes seem completely\r\nto get rid of all reason--all honour--all common ordinary honesty;\r\nwhile, if you were to take the same people singly, you would find that\r\nthey were reasonable enough, and would shrink with a feeling quite\r\napproaching to horror from anything in the shape of very flagrant\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nThis can only be accounted for by a piece of cowardice in the human\r\nrace, which induces them when alone, and acting with the full\r\nresponsibility of their actions, to shrink from what it is quite evident\r\nthey have a full inclination to do, and will do when, having partially\r\nlost their individuality in a crowd, they fancy, that to a certain\r\nextent they can do so with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe burning of Sir Francis Varney\'s house, although it was one of those\r\nproceedings which would not bear the test of patient examination, was\r\nyet, when we take all the circumstances into consideration, an act\r\nreally justifiable and natural in comparison with the one which was now\r\nmeditated.\r\n\r\nBannerworth Hall had never been the residence even of anyone who had\r\ndone the people any injury or given them any offence, so that to let it\r\nbecome a prey to the flames was but a gratuitous act of mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, or seemed to be, doomed, for all who have had any\r\nexperience in mobs, must know how extremely difficult it is to withdraw\r\nthem from any impulse once given, especially when that impulse, as in\r\nthe present instance, is of a violent character.\r\n\r\n"Down with Bannerworth Hall!" was the cry. "Burn it--burn it," and\r\naugmented by fresh numbers each minute, the ignorant, and, in many\r\nrespects, ruffianly assemblage, soon arrived within sight of what had\r\nbeen for so many years the bane of the Bannerworths, and whatever may\r\nhave been the fault of some of that race, those faults had been of a\r\ndomestic character, and not at all such as would interfere with the\r\npublic weal.\r\n\r\nThe astonished, and almost worn-out authorities, hastily, now, after\r\nhaving disposed of their prisoners, collected together what troops they\r\ncould, and by the time the misguided, or rather the not guided at all\r\npopulace, had got halfway to Bannerworth Hall, they were being\r\noutflanked by some of the dragoons, who, by taking a more direct route,\r\nhoped to reach Bannerworth Hall first, and so perhaps, by letting the\r\nmob see that it was defended, induce them to give up the idea of its\r\ndestruction on account of the danger attendant upon the proceeding by\r\nfar exceeding any of the anticipated delight of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE MEETING AT THE HALL BETWEEN MR. CHILLINGWORTH AND THE\r\nMYSTERIOUS FRIEND OF VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen we praise our friend Mr. Chillingworth for not telling his wife\r\nwhere he was going, in pursuance of a caution and a discrimination so\r\nhighly creditable to him, we are quite certain that he has no such\r\nexcuse as regards the reader. Therefore we say at once that he had his\r\nown reasons now for taking up his abode at Bannerworth Hall for a time.\r\nThese reasons seemed to be all dependant upon the fact of having met the\r\nmysterious man at Sir Francis Varney\'s; and although we perhaps would\r\nhave hoped that the doctor might have communicated to Henry Bannerworth\r\nall that he knew and all that he surmised, yet have we no doubt that\r\nwhat he keeps to himself he has good reasons for so keeping, and that\r\nhis actions as regards it are founded upon some very just conclusions.\r\n\r\nHe has then made a determination to take possession of, and remain in,\r\nBannerworth Hall according to the full and free leave which the admiral\r\nhad given him so to do. What results he anticipated from so lonely and\r\nso secret a watch we cannot say, but probably they will soon exhibit\r\nthemselves. It needed no sort of extraordinary discrimination for any\r\none to feel it once that not the least good, in the way of an ambuscade,\r\nwas likely to be effected by such persons as Admiral Bell or Jack\r\nPringle. They were all very well when fighting should actually ensue,\r\nbut they both were certainly remarkably and completely deficient in\r\ndiplomatic skill, or in that sort of patience which should enable them\r\nat all to compete with the cunning, the skill, and the nice\r\ndiscrimination of such a man as Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nIf anything were to be done in that way it was unquestionably to be done\r\nby some one alone, who, like the doctor, would, and could, remain\r\nprofoundly quiet and await the issue of events, be they what they might,\r\nand probably remain a spy and attempt no overt act which should be of a\r\nhostile character. This unquestionably was the mode, and perhaps we\r\nshould not be going too far when we say it was the only mode which could\r\nbe with anything like safety relied upon as one likely to lead really to\r\na discovery of Sir Francis Varney\'s motives in making such determined\r\nexertions to get possession of Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\nThat night was doomed to be a very eventful one, indeed; for on it had\r\nCharles Holland been, by a sort of wild impulsive generosity of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, rescued from the miserable dungeon in which he had been\r\nconfined, and on that night, too, he, whom we cannot otherwise describe\r\nthan as the villain Marchdale, had been, in consequence of the evil that\r\nhe himself meditated, and the crime with which he was quite willing to\r\nstain his soul, been condemned to occupy Charles\'s position.\r\n\r\nOn that night, too, had the infuriated mob determined upon the\r\ndestruction of Bannerworth Hall, and on that night was Mr. Chillingworth\r\nwaiting with what patience he could exert, at the Hall, for whatever in\r\nthe chapter of accidents might turn up of an advantageous character to\r\nthat family in whose welfare and fortunes he felt so friendly and so\r\ndeep an interest.\r\n\r\nLet us look, then, at the worthy doctor as he keeps his solitary watch.\r\n\r\nHe did not, as had been the case when the admiral shared the place with\r\nhim in the hope of catching Varney on that memorable occasion when he\r\ncaught only his boot, sit in a room with a light and the means and\r\nappliances for making the night pass pleasantly away; but, on the\r\ncontrary, he abandoned the house altogether, and took up a station in\r\nthat summer-house which has been before mentioned as the scene of a\r\nremarkable interview between Flora Bannerworth and Varney the vampyre.\r\n\r\nAlone and in the dark, so that he could not be probably seen, he watched\r\nthat one window of the chamber where the first appearance of the hideous\r\nvampyre had taken place, and which seemed ever since to be the special\r\nobject of his attack.\r\n\r\nBy remaining from twilight, and getting accustomed to the gradually\r\nincreasing darkness of the place, no doubt the doctor was able to see\r\nwell enough without the aid of any artificial light whether any one was\r\nin the place besides himself.\r\n\r\n"Night after night," he said, "will I watch here until I have succeeded\r\nin unravelling this mystery; for that there is some fearful and undreamt\r\nof mystery at the bottom of all these proceedings I am well convinced."\r\n\r\nWhen he made such a determination as this, Dr. Chillingworth was not at\r\nall a likely man to break it, so there, looking like a modern statue in\r\nthe arbour, he sat with his eyes fixed upon the balcony and the window\r\nof what used to be called Flora\'s room for some hours.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a contemplative man, and therefore he did not so acutely\r\nfeel the loneliness of his position as many persons would have done;\r\nmoreover, he was decidedly not of a superstitious turn of mind, although\r\ncertainly we cannot deny an imagination to him. However, if he really\r\nhad harboured some strange fears and terrors they would have been\r\nexcusable, when we consider how many circumstances had combined to make\r\nit almost a matter of demonstration that Sir Francis Varney was\r\nsomething more than mortal.\r\n\r\nWhat quantities of subjects the doctor thought over during his vigil in\r\nthat garden it is hard to say, but never in his whole life, probably,\r\nhad he such a glorious opportunity for the most undisturbed\r\ncontemplation of subjects requiring deep thought to analyze, than as he\r\nhad then. At least he felt that since his marriage he had never been so\r\nthoroughly quiet, and left so completely to himself.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that he succeeded in settling any medical points of a\r\nknotty character that might be hovering in his brain, and certain it is\r\nthat he had become quite absorbed in an abstruse matter connected with\r\nphysiology, when his ears were startled, and he was at once aroused to a\r\nfull consciousness of where he was, and why he had come there, by the\r\ndistant sound of a man\'s footstep.\r\n\r\nIt was a footstep which seemed to be that of a person who scarcely\r\nthought it at all necessary to use any caution, and the doctor\'s heart\r\nleaped within him as in the lowest possible whisper he said to\r\nhimself,--\r\n\r\n"I am successful--I am successful. It is believed now that the Hall is\r\ndeserted, and no doubt that is Sir Francis Varney come with confidence,\r\nto carry out his object in so sedulously attacking it, be that object\r\nwhat it may."\r\n\r\nElated with this idea, the doctor listened intently to the advancing\r\nfootstep, which each moment sounded more clearly upon his ears.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently approaching from the garden entrance towards the house,\r\nand he thought, by the occasional deadened sound of the person\'s feet,\r\nbe he whom he might, that he could not see his way very well, and,\r\nconsequently, frequently strayed from the path, on to some of the\r\nnumerous flower-beds which were in the way.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor, exultingly, "it must be Varney; and now I have\r\nbut to watch him, and not to resist him; for what good on earth is it to\r\nstop him in what he wishes to do, and, by such means, never wrest his\r\nsecret from him. The only way is to let him go on, and that will I do,\r\nmost certainly."\r\n\r\nNow he heard the indistinct muttering of the voice of some one, so low\r\nthat he could not catch what words were uttered; but he fancied that, in\r\nthe deep tones, he recognised, without any doubt, the voice of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney.\r\n\r\n"It must be he," he said, "it surely must be he. Who else would come\r\nhere to disturb the solitude of an empty house? He comes! he comes!"\r\n\r\nNow the doctor could see a figure emerge from behind some thick beeches,\r\nwhich had before obstructed his vision, and he looked scrutinisingly\r\nabout, while some doubts stole slowly over his mind now as to whether it\r\nwas the vampyre or not. The height was in favour of the supposition that\r\nit was none other than Varney; but the figure looked so much stouter,\r\nthat Mr. Chillingworth felt a little staggered upon the subject, and\r\nunable wholly to make up his mind upon it.\r\n\r\nThe pausing of this visitor, too, opposite that window where Sir Francis\r\nVarney had made his attempts, was another strong reason why the doctor\r\nwas inclined to believe it must be him, and yet he could not quite make\r\nup his mind upon the subject, so as to speak with certainty.\r\n\r\nA very short time, however, indeed, must have sufficed to set such a\r\nquestion as that at rest; and patience seemed the only quality of mind\r\nnecessary under those circumstances for Mr. Chillingworth to exert.\r\n\r\nThe visitor continued gazing either at that window, or at the whole\r\nfront of the house, for several minutes, and then he turned away from a\r\ncontemplation of it, and walked slowly along, parallel with the windows\r\nof that dining-room, one of which had been broken so completely on the\r\noccasion of the admiral\'s attempt to take the vampyre prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe moment the stranger altered his position, from looking at the\r\nwindow, and commenced walking away from it, Mr. Chillingworth\'s mind was\r\nmade up. It was not Varney--of that he felt now most positively assured,\r\nand could have no doubt whatever upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe gait, the general air, the walk, all were different; and then arose\r\nthe anxious question of who could it be that had intruded upon that\r\nlonely place, and what could be the object of any one else but Varney\r\nthe vampyre to do so.\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked a powerful man, and walked with a firm tread, and,\r\naltogether he was an opponent that, had the doctor been ever so\r\nbelligerently inclined, it would have been the height of indiscretion\r\nfor him to attempt to cope with.\r\n\r\nIt was a very vexatious thing, too, for any one to come there at such a\r\njuncture, perhaps only from motives of curiosity, or possibly just to\r\nendeavour to commit some petty depredations upon the deserted building,\r\nif possible; and most heartily did the doctor wish that, in some way, he\r\ncould scare away the intruder.\r\n\r\nThe man walked along very slowly, indeed, and seemed to be quite taking\r\nhis time in making his observations of the building; and this was the\r\nmore provoking, as it was getting late, and if having projected a visit\r\nat all, it would surely soon be made, and then, when he found any one\r\nthere, of course, he would go.\r\n\r\nAmazed beyond expression, the doctor felt about on the ground at his\r\nfeet, until he found a tolerably large stone, which he threw at the\r\nstranger with so good an aim, that it hit him a smart blow on the back,\r\nwhich must have been anything but a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nThat it was a surprise, and that, too, a most complete one, was evident\r\nfrom the start which the man gave, and then he uttered a furious oath,\r\nand rubbed his back, as he glanced about him to endeavour to ascertain\r\nfrom whence the missile had come.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try him again with that," thought the doctor; "it may succeed in\r\nscaring him away;" and he stooped to watch for another stone.\r\n\r\nIt was well that he did so at that precise moment; for, before he rose\r\nagain, he heard the sharp report of a pistol, and a crashing sound among\r\nsome of the old wood work of which the summer-house was composed, told\r\nhim that a shot had there taken effect. Affairs were now getting much\r\ntoo serious; and, accordingly, Dr. Chillingworth thought that, rather\r\nthan stay there to be made a target of, he would face the intruder.\r\n\r\n"Hold--hold!" he cried. "Who are you, and what do you mean by\r\nthat?"--"Oh! somebody is there," cried the man, as he advanced. "My\r\nfriend, whoever you are, you were very foolish to throw a stone at me."\r\n\r\n"And, my friend, whoever you are," responded the doctor, "you were very\r\nspiteful to fire a pistol bullet at me in consequence."--\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\n"But I say yes; for, probably, I can prove a right to be here, which you\r\ncannot."--"Ah!" said the stranger, "that voice--why--you are Dr.\r\nChillingworth?"\r\n\r\n"I am; but I don\'t know you," said the doctor, as he emerged now from\r\nthe summer-house, and confronted the stranger who was within a few paces\r\nof the entrance to it. Then he started, as he added,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do know you, though. How, in the name of Heaven, came you here,\r\nand what purpose have you in so coming?"\r\n\r\n"What purpose have you? Since we met at Varney\'s, I have been making\r\nsome inquiries about this neighbourhood, and learn strange\r\nthings."--"That you may very easily do here; and, what is more\r\nextraordinary, the strange things are, for the most part, I can assure\r\nyou, quite true."\r\n\r\nThe reader will, from what has been said, now readily recognise this man\r\nas Sir Francis Varney\'s mysterious visitor, to whom he gave, from some\r\nhidden cause or another, so large a sum of money, and between whom and\r\nDr. Chillingworth a mutual recognition had taken place, on the occasion\r\nwhen Sir Francis Varney had, with such cool assurance, invited the\r\nadmiral to breakfast with him at his new abode.\r\n\r\n"You, however," said the man, "I have no doubt, are fully qualified to\r\ntell me of more than I have been able to learn from other people; and,\r\nfirst of all, let me ask you why you are here?"--"Before I answer you\r\nthat question, or any other," said the doctor, "let me beg of you to\r\ntell me truly, is Sir Francis Varney--"\r\n\r\nThe doctor whispered in the ear of the stranger some name, as if he\r\nfeared, even there, in the silence of that garden, where everything\r\nconspired to convince him that he could not be overheard, to pronounce\r\nit in an audible tone.\r\n\r\n"He is," said the other.--"You have no manner of doubt of it?"\r\n\r\n"Doubt?--certainly not. What doubt can I have? I know it for a positive\r\ncertainty, and he knows, of course, that I do know it, and has purchased\r\nmy silence pretty handsomely, although I must confess that nothing but\r\nmy positive necessities would have induced me to make the large demands\r\nupon him that I have, and I hope soon to be able to release him\r\naltogether from them."\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head repeatedly, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"I suspected it; I suspected it, do you know, from the first moment that\r\nI saw you there in his house. His face haunted me ever since--awfully\r\nhaunted me; and yet, although I felt certain that I had once seen it\r\nunder strange circumstances, I could not identify it with--but no\r\nmatter, no matter. I am waiting here for him."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"--"Ay, that I am; and I flung a stone at you, not knowing you,\r\nwith hope that you would be, by such means, perhaps, scared away, and so\r\nleave the coast clear for him."\r\n\r\n"Then you have an appointment with him?"--"By no means; but he has made\r\nsuch repeated and determined attacks upon this house that the family who\r\ninhabited it were compelled to leave it, and I am here to watch him, and\r\nascertain what can possibly be his object."\r\n\r\n"It is as I suspected, then," muttered this man. "Confound him! Now can\r\nI read, as if in a book, most clearly, the game that he is playing!"\r\n\r\n"Can you?" cried the doctor, energetically--"can you? What is it? Tell\r\nme, for that is the very thing I want to discover."--"You don\'t say so?"\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed; and I assure you that it concerns the peace of a whole\r\nfamily to know it. You say you have made inquiries about this\r\nneighbourhood, and, if you have done so, you have discovered how the\r\nfamily of the Bannerworths have been persecuted by Varney, and how, in\r\nparticular, Flora Bannerworth, a beautiful and intelligent girl, has\r\nbeen most cruelly made to suffer."\r\n\r\n"I have heard all that, and I dare say with many exaggerations."--"It\r\nwould be difficult for any one really to exaggerate the horrors that\r\nhave taken place in this house, so that any information which you can\r\ngive respecting the motives of Varney will tend, probably, to restore\r\npeace to those who have been so cruelly persecuted, and be an act of\r\nkindness which I think not altogether inconsistent with your nature."\r\n\r\n"You think so, and yet know who I am."--"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And what I am. Why, if I were to go into the market-place of yon town,\r\nand proclaim myself, would not all shun me--ay, even the very lowest and\r\nvilest; and yet you talk of an act of kindness not being altogether\r\ninconsistent with my nature!"--"I do, because I know something more of\r\nyou than many."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of some moments\' duration, and then the stranger\r\nspoke in a tone of voice which looked as if he were struggling with some\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n"Sir, you do know more of me than many. You know what I have been, and\r\nyou know how I left an occupation which would have made me loathed. But\r\nyou--even you--do not know what made me take to so terrible a\r\ntrade."--"I do not."\r\n\r\n"Would it suit you for me now to tell you?"--"Will you first promise me\r\nthat you will do all you can for this persecuted family of the\r\nBannerworths, in whom I take so strange an interest?"\r\n\r\n"I will. I promise you that freely. Of my own knowledge, of course, I\r\ncan say but little concerning them, but, upon that warranting, I well\r\nbelieve they deserve abundant sympathy, and from me they shall have it."\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks! With your assistance, I have little doubt of being\r\nable to extricate them from the tangled web of dreadful incidents which\r\nhas turned them from their home; and now, whatever you may choose to\r\ntell me of the cause which drove you to be what you became, I shall\r\nlisten to with abundant interest. Only let me beseech you to come into\r\nthis summer-house, and to talk low."\r\n\r\n"I will, and you can pursue your watch at the same time, while I beguile\r\nits weariness."--"Be it so."\r\n\r\n"You knew me years ago, when I had all the chances in the world of\r\nbecoming respectable and respected. I did, indeed; and you may,\r\ntherefore, judge of my surprise when, some years since, being in the\r\nmetropolis, I met you, and you shunned my company."--"Yes; but, at last,\r\nyou found out why it was that I shunned your company."\r\n\r\n"I did. You yourself told me once that I met you, and would not leave\r\nyou, but insisted upon your dining with me. Then you told me, when you\r\nfound that I would take no other course whatever, that you were no other\r\nthan the--the----"--\r\n\r\n"Out with it! I can bear to hear it now better than I could then! I told\r\nyou that I was the common hangman of London!"\r\n\r\n"You did, I must confess, to my most intense surprise."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and yet you kept to me; and, but that I respected you too much to\r\nallow you to do so, you would, from old associations, have countenanced\r\nme; but I could not, and I would not, let you do so. I told you then\r\nthat, although I held the terrible office, that I had not been yet\r\ncalled upon to perform its loathsome functions. Soon--soon--come the\r\nfirst effort--it was the last!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed! You left the dreadful trade?"\r\n\r\n"I did--I did. But what I want to tell you, for I could not then, was\r\nwhy I went ever to it. The wounds my heart had received were then too\r\nfresh to allow me to speak of them, but I will tell you now. The story\r\nis a brief one, Mr. Chillingworth. I pray you be seated."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE STORY.--THE ARRIVAL OF THE MOB AT THE HALL, AND THEIR\r\nDISPERSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"You will find that the time which elapsed since I last saw you in\r\nLondon, to have been spent in an eventful, varied manner."--"You were in\r\ngood circumstances then," said Mr. Chillingworth.--"I was, but many\r\nevents happened after that which altered the prospect; made it even more\r\ngloomy than you can well imagine: but I will tell you all candidly, and\r\nyou can keep watch upon Bannerworth Hall at the same time. You are well\r\naware that I was well to do, and had ample funds, and inclination to\r\nspend them."--"I recollect: but you were married then, surely?"--"I\r\nwas," said the stranger, sadly, "I was married then."--"And now?"--"I am\r\na widower." The stranger seemed much moved, but, after a moment or so,\r\nhe resumed--"I am a widower now; but how that event came about is partly\r\nmy purpose to tell you. I had not married long--that is very long--for I\r\nhave but one child, and she is not old, or of an age to know much more\r\nthan what she may be taught; she is still in the course of education. I\r\nwas early addicted to gamble; the dice had its charms, as all those who\r\nhave ever engaged in play but too well know; it is perfectly\r\nfascinating."--"So I have heard," said Mr. Chillingworth; "though, for\r\nmyself, I found a wife and professional pursuits quite incompatible with\r\nany pleasure that took either time or resources."--\r\n\r\n"It is so. I would I had never entered one of those houses where men are\r\ndeprived of their money and their own free will, for at the\r\ngambling-table you have no liberty, save that in gliding down the stream\r\nin company with others. How few have ever escaped destruction--none, I\r\nbelieve--men are perfectly fascinated; it is ruin alone that enables a\r\nman to see how he has been hurried onwards without thought or\r\nreflection; and how fallacious were all the hopes he ever entertained!\r\nYes, ruin, and ruin alone, can do this; but, alas! \'tis then too\r\nlate--the evil is done. Soon after my marriage I fell in with a\r\nChevalier St. John. He was a man of the world in every sense of the\r\nword, and one that was well versed in all the ways of society. I never\r\nmet with any man who was so perfectly master of himself, and of perfect\r\nease and self-confidence as he was. He was never at a loss, and, come\r\nwhat would, never betrayed surprise or vexation--two qualities, he\r\nthought, never ought to be shown by any man who moved in society."--\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"--"He was a strange man--a very strange man."--\r\n\r\n"Did he gamble?"--\r\n\r\n"It is difficult to give you a correct and direct answer. I should say\r\nhe did, and yet he never lost or won much; but I have often thought he\r\nwas more connected with those who did than was believed."--\r\n\r\n"Was that a fact?" inquired Mr. Chillingworth.--\r\n\r\n"You shall see as we go on, and be able to judge for yourself. I have\r\nthought he was. Well, he first took me to a handsome saloon, where\r\ngambling was carried on. We had been to the opera. As we came out, he\r\nrecommended that we should sup at a house where he was well known, and\r\nwhere he was in the habit of spending his evenings after the opera, and\r\nbefore he retired. I agreed to this. I saw no reason why I should not.\r\nWe went there, and bitterly have I repented of so doing for years since,\r\nand do to this day."--\r\n\r\n"Your repentance has been sincere and lasting," said Mr. Chillingworth;\r\n"the one proves the other."--"It does; but I thought not so then. The\r\nplace was glittering, and the wine good. It was a kind of earthly\r\nparadise; and when we had taken some wine, the chevalier said to me,--\r\n\r\n"\'I am desirous of seeing a friend backwards; he is at the hazard-table.\r\nWill you go with me?\'--I hesitated. I feared to see the place where a\r\nvice was carried on. I knew myself inclined to prudential motives. I\r\nsaid to him,--\'No, St. John, I\'ll wait here for you; it may be as\r\nwell--the wine is good, and it will content me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do so,\' he said, smiling; \'but remember I seldom or never play myself,\r\nnor is there any reason why you should.\'--\'I\'ll go, but I will not\r\nplay.\'--\'Certainly not; you are free alike to look on, play, or quit the\r\nplace at any moment you please, and not be noticed, probably, by a\r\nsingle soul.\'\r\n\r\n"I arose, and we walked backwards, having called one of the men who were\r\nwaiting about, but who were watchers and door-keepers of the \'hell.\' We\r\nwere led along the passage, and passed through the pair of doors, which\r\nwere well secured and rendered the possibility of a surprise almost\r\nimpossible. After these dark places, we were suddenly let into a place\r\nwhere we were dazzled by the light and brilliancy of the saloon. It was\r\nnot so large as the one we left, but it was superior to it in all its\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\n"At first I could not well see who was, or who was not, in the room\r\nwhere we were. As soon, however, as I found the use of my eyes, I\r\nnoticed many well-dressed men, who were busily engaged in play, and who\r\ntook no notice of any one who entered. We walked about for some minutes\r\nwithout speaking to any one, but merely looking on. I saw men engaged in\r\nplay; some with earnestness, others again with great nonchalance, and\r\nmoney changed hands without the least remark. There were but few who\r\nspoke, and only those in play. There was a hum of conversation; but you\r\ncould not distinguish what was said, unless you paid some attention to,\r\nand was in close vicinity with, the individual who spoke.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' said St. John, \'what do you think of this place?\'--\'Why,\' I\r\nreplied, \'I had no notion of seeing a place fitted up as this is.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No; isn\'t it superb?\'--\'It is beautifully done. They have many\r\nvisitors,\' said I, \'many more than I could have believed.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, they are all _bona fide_ players; men of stamp and rank--none of\r\nyour seedy legs who have only what they can cheat you out\r\nof.\'--\'Ah!\'--\'And besides,\' he added, \'you may often form friendships\r\nhere that lead to fortune hereafter. I do not mean in play, because\r\nthere is no necessity for your doing so, or, if you do so, in going\r\nabove a stake which you know won\'t hurt you.\'--\'Exactly.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Many men can never approach a table like this, and sit down to an\r\nhour\'s play, but, if they do, they must stake not only more than they\r\ncan afford, but all their property, leaving themselves beggars.\' \'They\r\ndo?" said I.\r\n\r\n"\'But men who know themselves, their resources, and choose to indulge\r\nfor a time, may often come and lay the foundation to a very pretty\r\nfortune.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you see your friend?\' I inquired.--\'No, I do not; but I will\r\ninquire if he has been here--if not, we will go.\'\r\n\r\n"He left me for a moment or two to make some inquiry, and I stood\r\nlooking at the table, where there were four players, and who seemed to\r\nbe engaged at a friendly game; and when one party won they looked grave,\r\nand when the other party lost they smiled and looked happy. I walked\r\naway, as the chevalier did not return immediately to me; and then I saw\r\na gentleman rise up from a table. He had evidently lost. I was standing\r\nby the seat, unconsciously holding the back in my hand. I sat down\r\nwithout thinking or without speaking, and found myself at the hazard\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you play, sir?\'--\'Yes,\' I said. I had hardly uttered the words when\r\nI was sorry for them; but I could not recall them. I sat down, and play\r\nat once commenced.\r\n\r\n"In about ten or fifteen minutes, often losing and then winning, I found\r\nmyself about a hundred and twenty pounds in pocket, clear gain by the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah!\' said the chevalier, who came up at that moment, \'I thought you\r\nwouldn\'t play.\'--\'I really don\'t know how it happened,\' said I, \'but I\r\nsuddenly found myself here without any previous intention.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You are not a loser, I hope?\'--\'Indeed I am not,\' I replied; \'but not\r\nmuch a gainer.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Nor need you desire to be. Do you desire to give your adversary his\r\nrevenge now, or take another opportunity.\'--\'At another time,\' I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"\'You will find me here the day after to-morrow, when I shall be at your\r\nservice;\' then bowing, he turned away.\r\n\r\n"\'He is a very rich man whom you have been playing with,\' said the\r\nchevalier.--"\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, and I have known him to lose for three days together; but you may\r\ntake his word for any amount; he is a perfect gentleman and man of\r\nhonour.\'--\'\'Tis well to play with such,\' I replied; \'but I suppose you\r\nare about to leave.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, it grows late, and I have some business to transact to-morrow, so\r\nI must leave.\'--\'I will accompany you part of the way home,\' said I,\r\n\'and then I shall have finished the night.\'\r\n\r\n"I did leave with him, and accompanied him home, and then walked to my\r\nown home."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"This was my first visit, and I thought a propitious beginning, but it\r\nwas the more dangerous. Perhaps a loss might have effectually deterred\r\nme, but it is doubtful to tell how certain events might have been\r\naltered. It is just possible that I might have been urged on by my\r\ndesire to retrieve any loss I might have incurred, and so made myself at\r\nonce the miserable being it took months to accomplish in bringing me to.\r\n\r\n"I went the day but one after this, to meet the same individual at the\r\ngambling-table, and played some time with varied success, until I left\r\noff with a trifling loss upon the night\'s play, which was nothing of any\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Thus matters went on; I sometimes won and sometimes lost, until I won a\r\nfew hundreds, and this determined me to play for higher stakes than any\r\nI had yet played for.\r\n\r\n"It was no use going on in the peddling style I had been going on; I had\r\nwon two hundred and fifty pounds in three months, and had I been less\r\nfearful I might have had twenty-five thousand pounds. Ah! I\'ll try my\r\nfortune at a higher game.\r\n\r\n"Having once made this resolution, I was anxious to begin my new plan,\r\nwhich I hoped would have the effect of placing me far above my then\r\npresent position in society, which was good, and with a little attention\r\nit would have made me an independent man; but then it required patience,\r\nand nothing more. However, the other method was so superior since it\r\nmight all be done with good luck in a few months. Ah! good luck; how\r\nuncertain is good luck; how changeful is fortune; how soon is the best\r\nprospect blighted by the frosts of adversity. In less than a month I had\r\nlost more than I could pay, and then I gambled on for a living.\r\n\r\n"My wife had but one child; her first and only one; an infant at her\r\nbreast; but there was a change came over her; for one had come over\r\nme--a fearful one it was too--one not only in manner but in fortune too.\r\nShe would beg me to come home early; to attend to other matters, and\r\nleave the dreadful life I was then leading.\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy,\' said I, \'we are ruined.\'--\'Ruined!\' she exclaimed, and\r\nstaggered back, until she fell into a seat. \'Ruined!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Ay, ruined. It is a short word, but expressive.\'--\'No, no, we are not\r\nruined. I know what you mean, you would say, we cannot live as we have\r\nlived; we must retrench, and so we will, right willingly.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You must retrench most wonderfully,\' I said, with desperate calmness,\r\n\'for the murder must out.\'--\'And so we will; but you will be with us;\r\nyou will not go out night after night, ruining your health, our\r\nhappiness, and destroying both peace and prospects.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No, no, Lizzy, we have no chance of recovering ourselves; house and\r\nhome--all gone--all, all.\'--\'My God!\' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"\'Ay, rail on,\' said I; \'you have cause enough; but, no matter--we have\r\nlost all.\'--\'How--how?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It is useless to ask how; I have done, and there is an end of the\r\nmatter; you shall know more another day; we must leave this house for a\r\nlodging.\'--\'It matters little,\' she said; \'all may be won again, if you\r\nwill but say you will quit the society of those who have ruined you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No one,\' said I, \'has ruined me; I did it; it was no fault of any one\r\nelse\'s; I have not that excuse.\'--\'I am sure you can recover.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I may; some day fortune will shower her favours upon me, and I live on\r\nin that expectation.\'--\'You cannot mean that you will chance the\r\ngaming-table? for I am sure you must have lost all there?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I have.\'--\'God help me,\' she said; \'you have done your child a wrong,\r\nbut you may repair it yet.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Never!\'--\'\'Tis a long day! let me implore you, on my knees, to leave\r\nthis place, and adopt some other mode of life; we can be careful; a\r\nlittle will do, and we shall, in time, be equal to, and better than what\r\nwe have been.\'\r\n\r\n"\'We never can, save by chance.\'--\'And by chance we never shall,\' she\r\nreplied; \'if you will exert yourself, we may yet retrieve ourselves.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And exert myself I will.\'--\'And quit the gaming-table?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Ask me to make no promises,\' said I; \'I may not be able to keep them;\r\ntherefore, ask me to make none.\'--\'I do ask you, beg of, entreat of you\r\nto promise, and solemnly promise me that you will leave that fearful\r\nplace, where men not only lose all their goods, but the feelings of\r\nnature also.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Say no more, Lizzy; if I can get a living elsewhere I will, but if\r\nnot, I must get it there.\'\r\n\r\n"She seemed to be cast down at this, and she shed tears. I left the\r\nroom, and again went to the gambling-house, and there that night, I won\r\na few pounds, which enabled me to take my wife and child away from the\r\nhouse they had so long lived in, and took them afterwards to a miserable\r\nplace,--one room, where, indeed, there were a few articles of furniture\r\nthat I had saved from the general wreck of my own property.\r\n\r\n"She took things much less to heart than I could have anticipated; she\r\nseemed cheerful and happy,--she endeavoured to make my home as\r\ncomfortable as she could.\r\n\r\n"Her whole endeavour was to make me as much as possible, forget the\r\npast. She wanted, as much as possible, to wean me away from my gambling\r\npursuits, but that was impossible. I had no hope, no other prospect.\r\n\r\n"Thus she strove, but I could see each day she was getting paler, and\r\nmore pale; her figure, before round, was more thin, and betrayed signs\r\nof emaciation. This preyed upon me; and, when fortune denied me the\r\nmeans of carrying home that which she so much wanted, I could never\r\nreturn for two days at a time. Then I would find her shedding tears, and\r\nsighing; what could I say? If I had anything to take her, then I used to\r\nendeavour to make her forget that I had been away.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah!\' she would exclaim, \'you will find me dead one of these days; what\r\nyou do now for one or two days, you will do by-and-bye for many days,\r\nperhaps weeks.\'--\'Do not anticipate evil.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I cannot do otherwise; were you in any other kind of employment but\r\nthat of gambling,\' she said, \'I should have some hope of you; but, as it\r\nis, there is none.\'--\'Speak not of it; my chances may turn out\r\nfavourable yet, and you may be again as you were.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Never.\'--\'But fortune is inconstant, and may change in my favour as\r\nmuch as she has done in others.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Fortune is indeed constant, but misfortune is as inconstant.\'--\'You\r\nare prophetic of evil."\r\n\r\n"\'Ah! I would to Heaven I could predict good; but who ever yet heard of\r\na ruined gambler being able to retrieve himself by the same means that\r\nhe was ruined?\'\r\n\r\n"Thus we used to converse, but our conversation was usually of but\r\nlittle comfort to either of us, for we could give neither any comfort to\r\nthe other; and as that was usually the case, our interviews became less\r\nfrequent, and of less duration. My answer was always the same.\r\n\r\n"\'I have no other chance; my prospects are limited to that one place;\r\ndeprive me of that, and I never more should be able to bring you a\r\nmouthful of bread.\'\r\n\r\n"Day after day,--day after day, the same result followed, and I was as\r\nfar from success as ever I was, and ever should be; I was yet a beggar.\r\n\r\n"The time flew by; my little girl was nearly four years old, but she\r\nknew not the misery her father and mother had to endure. The poor little\r\nthing sometimes went without more than a meal a day; and while I was\r\nliving thus upon the town, upon the chances of the gaming-table, many a\r\npang did she cause me, and so did her mother. My constant consolation\r\nwas this,--\r\n\r\n"\'It is bad luck now,\' I would say; \'but will be better by-and-bye;\r\nthings cannot always continue thus. It is all for them--all for them.\'\r\n\r\n"I thought that by continuing constantly in one course, I must be at\r\nland at the ebb of the tide. \'It cannot always flow one way,\' I thought.\r\nI had often heard people say that if you could but have the resolution\r\nto play on, you must in the end seize the turn of fortune.\r\n\r\n"\'If I could but once do that, I would never enter a hell again as long\r\nas I drew breath.\'\r\n\r\n"This was a resolve I could not only make but keep, because I had\r\nsuffered so much that I would never run through the same misery again\r\nthat I had already gone through. However, fortune never seemed inclined\r\nto take the turn I had hoped for; fortune was as far off as ever, and\r\nhad in no case given me any opportunity of recovering myself.\r\n\r\n"A few pounds were the utmost I could at any time muster, and I had to\r\nkeep up something of an appearance, and seem as if I had a thousand a\r\nyear; when, God knows, I could not have mustered a thousandth part of\r\nthat sum, were all done and paid for.\r\n\r\n"Day after day passed on, and yet no change. I had almost given myself\r\nup to despair, when one night when I went home I saw my wife was more\r\nthan usually melancholy and sad, and perhaps ill; I didn\'t look at\r\nher--I seldom did, because her looks were always a reproach to me; I\r\ncould not help feeling them so.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' said I, \'I have come home to you because I have something to\r\nbring you; not what I ought--but what I can--you must be satisfied!\'--\'I\r\nam,\' she said.\r\n\r\n"\'I know also you want it; how is the child, is she quite well?\'--\'Yes,\r\nquite.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Where is she?\' inquired I, looking round the room, but I didn\'t see\r\nher; she used to be up.--\'She has gone to bed,\' she said.\r\n\r\n"\'It is very early.\'--\'Yes, but she cried so for food that I was obliged\r\nto get her to sleep to forget her hunger: poor thing, she has wanted\r\nbread very badly.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Poor thing!\' I said, \'let her be awakened and partake of what I have\r\nbrought home.\'\r\n\r\n"With that my wife waked her up, and the moment she opened her eyes she\r\nagain began to cry for food, which I immediately gave her and saw her\r\ndevour with the utmost haste and hunger. The sight smote my heart, and\r\nmy wife sat by watching, and endeavouring to prevent her from eating so\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n"\'This is bad,\' I said.--\'Yes, but I hope it may be the worst,\' she\r\nreplied, in a deep and hollow voice.\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy,\' I exclaimed, \'what is the matter--are you ill?\'--\'Yes, very\r\nill.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What is the matter with you? For God\'s sake tell me,\' I said, for I\r\nwas alarmed.--\'I am very ill,\' she said, \'very ill indeed; I feel my\r\nstrength decreasing every day. I must drink.\'\r\n\r\n"You, too, want food?\'--\'I have and perhaps do, though the desire to eat\r\nseems almost to have left me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'For Heaven\'s sake eat,\' said I; \'I will bring you home something more\r\nby to-morrow; eat and drink Lizzy. I have suffered; but for you and your\r\nchild\'s sake, I will do my best.\'--\'Your best,\' she said, \'will kill us\r\nboth; but, alas, there is no other aid at hand. You may one day,\r\nhowever, come here too late to find us living.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Say no more, Lizzy, you know not my feelings when you speak thus;\r\nalas, I have no hope--no aid--no friend.\'--\'No,\' she replied, \'your love\r\nof gaming drove them from you, because they would not aid a gambler.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Say no more, Lizzy,\' I said; \'if there be not an end to this life\r\nsoon, there will be an end to me. In two days more I shall return to\r\nyou. Good bye; God bless you. Keep up your heart and the child.\'--\'Good\r\nbye,\' she said, sorrowfully. She shed tears, and wrung her hands\r\nbitterly. I hastened away--my heart was ready to burst, and I could not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"I walked about to recover my serenity, but could not do so sufficiently\r\nwell to secure anything like an appearance that would render me fit to\r\ngo to the gaming-house. That night I remained away, but I could not\r\navoid falling into a debauch to drown my misfortunes, and shift the\r\nscene of misery that was continually before my eyes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The next night I was at the gaming-house. I went there in better than\r\nusual spirits. I saw, I thought, a change in fortune, and hailed that as\r\nthe propitious moment of my life, when I was to rise above my present\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n"I played and won--played and lost--played and won, and then lost again;\r\nthus I went on, fluctuating more and more, until I found I was getting\r\nmoney in my pocket. I had, at one moment more than three hundred pounds\r\nin my pocket, and I felt that then was my happy moment--then the tide of\r\nfortune was going in my favour. I ought to have left off with that--to\r\nhave been satisfied with such an amount of money; but the demon of\r\navarice seemed to have possessed me, and I went on and on with\r\nfluctuating fortune, until I lost the whole of it.\r\n\r\n"I was mad--desperate, and could have destroyed myself; but I thought of\r\nthe state my wife and child were in; I thought that that night they\r\nwould want food; but they could not hurt for one day--they must have\r\nsome, or would procure some.\r\n\r\n"I was too far gone to be able to go to them, even if I were possessed\r\nof means; but I had none, and daylight saw me in a deep sleep, from\r\nwhich I awoke not until the next evening let in, and then I once more\r\ndetermined that I would make a desperate attempt to get a little money.\r\nI had always paid, and thought my word would be taken for once; and, if\r\nI won, all well and good; if not, then I was no worse off than before.\r\n\r\n"This was easy to plan, but not to execute. I went there, but there were\r\nnone present in whom I had sufficient interest to dare make the attempt.\r\nI walked about, and felt in a most uncomfortable state. I feared I\r\nshould not succeed at all, then what was to become of me--of my wife and\r\nchild? This rendered me almost mad. I could not understand what I was to\r\ndo, what to attempt, or where to go. One or two persons came up, and\r\nasked me if I were ill. My answers were, that I was well enough. Good\r\nGod! how far from the truth was that; but I found I must place more\r\ncontrol on my feelings, else I should cause much conversation, and then\r\nI should lose all hope of recovering myself, and all prospect of living,\r\neven.\r\n\r\n"At length some one did come in, and I remarked I had been there all the\r\nevening and had not played. I had an invitation to play with him, which\r\nended, by a little sleight of hand, in my favour; and on that I had\r\ncalculated as much as on any good fortune I might meet. The person I\r\nplayed with observed it not, and, when we left off playing, I had some\r\nsix or seven pounds in pocket. This, to me, was a very great sum; and,\r\nthe moment I could decently withdraw myself, I ran off home.\r\n\r\n"I was fearful of the scene that awaited me. I expected something; worse\r\nthan I had yet seen. Possibly Lizzy might be angry, and scold as well\r\nas complain. I therefore tapped at the door gently, but heard no one\r\nanswer; but of this I took no notice, as I believed that they might be,\r\nand were, most probably, fast asleep. I had provided myself with a\r\nlight, and I therefore opened the door, which was not fastened.\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy!\' said I, \'Lizzy!\' There was no answer given, and I paused.\r\nEverything was as still as death. I looked on the bed--there lay my wife\r\nwith her clothes on.\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy! Lizzy!\' said I. But still she did not answer me.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' said I, \'she sleeps sound;\' and I walked towards the bed, and\r\nplaced my hand upon her shoulder, and began to shake her, saying, as I\r\ndid so,--\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy! Lizzy! I\'m come home.\' But still no answer, or signs of\r\nawaking.\r\n\r\n"I went on the other side of the bed to look at her face, and some\r\nmisgivings overtook me. I trembled much. She lay on the bed, with her\r\nback towards the spot where I stood.\r\n\r\n"I came towards her face. My hand shook violently as I endeavoured to\r\nlook at her. She had her eyes wide open, as if staring at me.\r\n\r\n"\'Lizzy,\' said I. No answer was returned. I then placed my hand upon her\r\ncheek. It was enough, and I started back in great horror. She was dead!\r\n\r\n"This was horror itself. I staggered back and fell into a chair. The\r\nlight I placed down, Heaven knows how or why; but there I sat staring at\r\nthe corpse of my unfortunate wife. I can hardly tell you the tremendous\r\neffect this had upon me. I could not move. I was fascinated to the spot.\r\nI could not move and could not turn."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"It was morning, and the rays of the sun illumined the apartment; but\r\nthere sat I, still gazing upon the face of my unfortunate wife, I saw, I\r\nknew she was dead; but yet I had not spoken, but sat looking at her.\r\n\r\n"I believe my heart was as cold as she was; but extreme horror and dread\r\nhad dried up all the warm blood in my body, and I hardly think there was\r\na pulsation left. The thoughts of my child never once seemed to cross my\r\nmind. I had, however, sat there long--some hours before I was\r\ndiscovered, and this was by the landlady.\r\n\r\n"I had left the door open behind me, and she, in passing down, had the\r\ncuriosity to peep, and saw me sitting in what she thought to be a very\r\nstrange attitude, and could hear no sounds.\r\n\r\n"After some time she discovered my wife was dead, and, for some time,\r\nshe thought me so, too. However, she was convinced to the contrary, and\r\nthen began to call for assistance. This awoke the child, which was\r\nnearly famished. The landlady, to become useful, and to awaken me from\r\nmy lethargy, placed the child in my hands, telling me I was the best\r\nperson now to take care of it.\r\n\r\n"And so I was; there was no doubt of the truth of that, and I was\r\ncompelled to acknowledge it. I felt much pride and pleasure in my\r\ndaughter, and determined she should, if I starved, have the benefit of\r\nall I could do for her in the way of care, &c."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The funeral over, I took my child and carried it to a school, where I\r\nleft her, and paid in advance, promising to do so as often as the\r\nquarter came round. My wife I had seen buried by the hands of man, and I\r\nswore I would do the best for my child, and to keep this oath was a work\r\nof pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I determined also I would never more enter a gaming-house, be the\r\nextremity what it might; I would suffer even death before I would permit\r\nmyself to enter the house in which it took place.\r\n\r\n"\'I will,\' I thought, \'obtain some employment of some kind or other. I\r\ncould surely obtain that. I have only to ask and I have it,\r\nsurely--something, however menial, that would keep me and my child. Yes,\r\nyes--she ought, she must have her charges paid at once."\r\n\r\n"The effect of my wife\'s death was a very great shock to me, and such a\r\none I could not forget--one I shall ever remember, and one that at least\r\nmade a lasting impression upon me."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Strange, but true, I never entered a gambling-house; it was my horror\r\nand my aversion. And yet I could obtain no employment. I took my\r\ndaughter and placed her at a boarding-school, and tried hard to obtain\r\nbread by labour; but, do what would, none could be had; if my soul\r\ndepended upon it, I could find none. I cared not what it was--anything\r\nthat was honest.\r\n\r\n"I was reduced low--very low; gaunt starvation showed itself in my\r\ncheeks; but I wandered about to find employment; none could be found,\r\nand the world seemed to have conspired together to throw me back to the\r\ngaming-table.\r\n\r\n"But this I would not. At last employment was offered; but what was it?\r\nThe situation of common hangman was offered me. The employment was\r\ndisgusting and horrible; but, at the same time, it was all I could get,\r\nand that was a sufficient inducement for me to accept of it. I was,\r\ntherefore, the common executioner; and in that employment for some time\r\nearned a living. It was terrible; but necessity compelled me to accept\r\nthe only thing I could obtain. You now know the reason why I became what\r\nI have told you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT OF THE VAMPIRE.--THE GENERAL MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mysterious friend of Mr. Chillingworth finished his narrative, and\r\nthen the doctor said to him,--\r\n\r\n"And that, then, is the real cause why you, a man evidently far above\r\nthe position of life which is usually that of those who occupy the\r\ndreadful post of executioner, came to accept of it."--"The real reason,\r\nsir. I considered, too, that in holding such a humiliating situation\r\nthat I was justly served for the barbarity of which I had been guilty;\r\nfor what can be a greater act of cruelty than to squander, as I did, in\r\nthe pursuit of mad excitement, those means which should have rendered my\r\nhome happy, and conduced to the welfare of those who were dependant upon\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to say that your self-reproaches are unjust altogether,\r\nbut--What noise is that? do you hear anything?"--\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"What do you take it to be?"--"It seemed like the footsteps of a number\r\nof persons, and it evidently approaches nearer and nearer. I know not\r\nwhat to think."\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you?" said a deep-toned voice, and some one, through the\r\norifice in the back of the summer-house, which, it will be recollected,\r\nsustained some damage at the time that Varney escaped from it, laid a\r\nhand upon Mr. Chillingworth\'s shoulder. "God bless me!" exclaimed the\r\ndoctor; "who\'s that?" and he sprang from his seat with the greatest\r\nperturbation in the world.\r\n\r\n"Varney, the vampyre!" added the voice, and then both the doctor and his\r\ncompanion recognised it, and saw the strange, haggard features, that now\r\nthey knew so well, confronting them. There was a pause of surprise, for\r\na moment or two, on the part of the doctor, and then he said, "Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, what brings you here? I conjure you to tell me, in the\r\nname of common justice and common feeling, what brings you to this house\r\nso frequently? You have dispossessed the family, whose property it is,\r\nof it, and you have caused great confusion and dismay over a whole\r\ncounty. I implore you now, not in the language of menace or as an enemy,\r\nbut as the advocate of the oppressed, and one who desires to see justice\r\ndone to all, to tell me what it is you require."\r\n\r\n"There is no time now for explanation," said Varney, "if explanations\r\nwere my full and free intent. You wished to know what noise was that you\r\nheard?"\r\n\r\n"I did; can you inform me?"--"I can. The wild and lawless mob which you\r\nand your friends first induced to interfere in affairs far beyond their\r\nor your control, are now flushed with the desire of riot and of plunder.\r\nThe noise you hear is that of their advancing footsteps; they come to\r\ndestroy Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"Can that be possible? The Bannerworth family are the sufferers from all\r\nthat has happened, and not the inflictors of suffering."--"Ay, be it so;\r\nbut he who once raises a mob has raised an evil spirit, which, in the\r\nmajority of cases, it requires a far more potent spell than he is master\r\nof to quell again."\r\n\r\n"It is so. That is a melancholy truth; but you address me, Sir Francis\r\nVarney, as if I led on the mob, when in reality I have done all that lay\r\nin my power, from the very first moment of their rising on account of\r\nthis affair, which, in the first instance, was your work, to prevent\r\nthem from proceeding to acts of violence."--"It may be so; but if you\r\nhave now any regard for your own safety you will quit this place. It\r\nwill too soon become the scene of a bloody contention. A large party of\r\ndragoons are even now by another route coming towards it, and it will be\r\ntheir duty to resist the aggressions of the mob; then should the rioters\r\npersevere, you can guess the result."--"I can, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Retire then while you may, and against the bad deeds of Sir Francis\r\nVarney at all events place some of his good ones, that he may not seem\r\nwholly without one redeeming trait."--"I am not accustomed," said the\r\ndoctor, "to paint the devil blacker than he really is; but yet the cruel\r\npersecutions that the Bannerworth family have endured call aloud for\r\njustice. You still, with a perseverance which shows you regardless of\r\nwhat others suffer so that you compass your own ends, hover round a spot\r\nwhich you have rendered desolate."\r\n\r\n"Hark, sir; do you not hear the tramp of horses\' feet?"--"I do."\r\n\r\nThe noise made by the feet of the insurgents was now almost drowned in\r\nthe louder and more rapid tramp of the horses\' feet of the advancing\r\ndragoons, and, in a few moments more, Sir Francis Varney waved his arm,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"They are here. Will you not consult your safety by flight?"--"No," said\r\nMr. Chillingworth\'s companion; "we prefer remaining here at the risk\r\neven of whatever danger may accrue to us."\r\n\r\n"Fools, would you die in a chance _melee_ between an infuriated populace\r\nand soldiery?"--"Do not leave," whispered the ex-hangman to Mr.\r\nChillingworth; "do not leave, I pray you. He only wants to have the Hall\r\nto himself."\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt now of the immediate appearance of the cavalry,\r\nand, before Sir Francis Varney could utter another word, a couple of the\r\nforemost of the soldiers cleared the garden fence at a part where it was\r\nlow, and alighted not many feet from the summer-house in which this\r\nshort colloquy was taking place. Sir Francis Varney uttered a bitter\r\noath, and immediately disappeared in the gloom.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do?" said the hangman.--"You can do what you like, but I\r\nshall avow my presence to the military, and claim to be on their side in\r\nthe approaching contest, if it should come to one, which I sincerely\r\nhope it will not."\r\n\r\nThe military detachment consisted of about twenty-five dragoons, who now\r\nwere all in the gardens. An order was given by the officer in command\r\nfor them to dismount, which was at once obeyed, and the horses were\r\nfastened by their bridles to the various trees with which the place\r\nabounded.\r\n\r\n"They are going to oppose the mob on foot, with their carbines," said\r\nthe hangman; "there will be sad work here I am afraid."--"Well, at all\r\nevents," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I shall decline acting the part of a\r\nspy here any longer; so here goes."\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! a friend,--a friend here, in the summer-house!"\r\n\r\n"Make it two friends," cried the hangman, "if you please, while you are\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nA couple of the dragoons immediately appeared, and the doctor, with his\r\ncompanion, were marched, as prisoners, before the officer in command.\r\n\r\n"What do you do here?" he said; "I was informed that the Hall was\r\ndeserted. Here, orderly, where is Mr. Adamson, the magistrate, who came\r\nwith me?"--"Close at hand sir, and he says he\'s not well."\r\n\r\n"Well, or ill, he must come here, and do something with these people."\r\n\r\nA magistrate of the district who had accompanied the troops, and been\r\naccommodated with a seat behind one of the dragoons, which seemed very\r\nmuch to have disagreed with him, for he was as pale as death, now\r\nstepped forward.\r\n\r\n"You know me, Mr. Adamson?" said the doctor; "I am Mr.\r\nChillingworth."--"Oh! yes; Lord bless you! how came you here?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that just now; you can vouch for my having no connection\r\nwith the rioters."--"Oh! dear, yes; certainly. This is a respectable\r\ngentleman, Captain Richardson, and a personal friend of mine."\r\n\r\n"Oh! very good."--"And I," said the doctor\'s companion, "am likewise a\r\nrespectable and useful member of society, and a great friend of Mr.\r\nChillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen," said the captain in command, "you may remain here, if\r\nyou like, and take the chances, or you may leave."\r\n\r\nThey intimated that they preferred remaining, and, almost at the moment\r\nthat they did so, a loud shout from many throats announced the near\r\napproach of the mob.--"Now, Mr. Magistrate, if you please," said the\r\nofficer; "you will be so good as to tell the mob that I am here with my\r\ntroop, under your orders, and strongly advise them to be off while they\r\ncan, with whole skins, for if they persevere in attacking the place, we\r\nmust persevere in defending it; and, if they have half a grain of sense\r\namong them, they can surely guess what the result of that will be."\r\n\r\n"I will do the best I can, as Heaven is, my judge," said the magistrate,\r\n"to produce a peaceable recall,--more no man can do."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! hurrah!"\' shouted the mob, "down with the Vampyre! down with\r\nthe Hall!" and then one, more candid than his fellows, shouted,--"Down\r\nwith everything and everybody!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" remarked the officer; "that fellow now knows what he came about."\r\n\r\nA great number of torches and links were lighted by the mob, but the\r\nmoment the glare of light fell upon the helmets and accoutrements of the\r\nmilitary, there was a pause of consternation on the part of the\r\nmultitude, and Mr. Adamson, urged on by the officer, who, it was\r\nevident, by no means liked the service he was on, took advantage of the\r\nopportunity, and, stepping forward, he said,--\r\n\r\n"My good people, and fellow townsmen, let me implore you to listen to\r\nreason, and go to your homes in peace. If you do not, but, on the\r\ncontrary, in defiance of law and good order, persist in attacking this\r\nhouse, it will become my painful duty to read the riot act, and then the\r\nmilitary and you will have to fight it out together, which I beg you\r\nwill avoid, for you know that some of you will be killed, and a lot more\r\nof you receive painful wounds. Now disperse, let me beg of you, at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nThere seemed for a moment a disposition among the mob to give up the\r\ncontest, but there were others among them who were infuriated with\r\ndrink, and so regardless of all consequences. Those set up a shout of\r\n"Down with the red coats; we are Englishmen, and will do what we like."\r\nSome one then threw a heavy stone, which struck one of the soldiers, and\r\nbrought blood from his cheek. The officer saw it, but he said at once,--\r\n\r\n"Stand firm, now, stand firm. No anger--steady."\r\n\r\n"Twenty pounds for the man who threw that stone," said the\r\nmagistrate.--"Twenty pound ten for old Adamson, the magistrate," cried a\r\nvoice in the crowd, which, no doubt came from him who had cast the\r\nmissile.\r\n\r\nThen, at least fifty stones were thrown, some of which hit the\r\nmagistrate, and the remainder came rattling upon the helmets of the\r\ndragoons, like a hail shower.\r\n\r\n"I warn you, and beg of you to go," said Mr. Adamson; "for the sake of\r\nyour wives and families, I beg of you not to pursue this desperate\r\ngame."\r\n\r\nLoud cries now arose of "Down with the soldiers; down with the vampyre.\r\nHe\'s in Bannerworth Hall. Smoke him out." And then one or two links were\r\nhurled among the dismounted dragoons. All this was put up with\r\npatiently; and then again the mob were implored to leave, which being\r\nanswered by fresh taunts, the magistrate proceeded to read the riot act,\r\nnot one word of which was audible amid the tumult that prevailed.\r\n\r\n"Put out all the lights," cried a voice among the mob. The order was\r\nobeyed, and the same voice added; "they dare not fire on us. Come on:"\r\nand a rush was made at the garden wall.\r\n\r\n"Make ready--present," cried the officer. And then he added, in an under\r\ntone, "above their heads, now--fire."\r\n\r\nThere was a blaze of light for a moment, a stunning noise, a shout of\r\ndismay from the mob, and in another moment all was still.\r\n\r\n"There," said Dr. Chillingworth, "that this is, at all events, a\r\nbloodless victory."\r\n\r\n"You may depend upon that," said his companion; "but is not there some\r\none yet remaining? Look there, do you not see a figure clambering over\r\nthe fence?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do, indeed. Ah, they have him a prisoner, at all events. Those\r\ntwo dragoons have him, fast enough; we shall now, perhaps, hear from\r\nthis fellow who is the actual ringleader in such an affair, which, but\r\nfor the pusillanimity of the mob, might have turned out to be really\r\nmost disastrous."\r\n\r\nIt was strange how one man should think it expedient to attack the\r\nmilitary post after the mob had been so completely routed at the first\r\ndischarge of fire-arms, but so it was. One man did make an attempt to\r\nenter the garden, and it was so rapid and so desperate an one, that he\r\nrather seemed to throw himself bodily at the fence, which separated it\r\nfrom the meadows without, than to clamber over it, as any one under\r\nordinary circumstances, who might wish to effect an entrance by that\r\nmeans, would have done.\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner, however, perceived, than a couple of the dismounted\r\nsoldiers stepped forward and made a prisoner of him.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" exclaimed Mr. Chillingworth, as they approached nearer with\r\nhim. "Good God! what is the meaning of that? Do my eyes deceive me, or\r\nare they, indeed, so blessed?"\r\n\r\n"Blessed by what?" exclaimed the hangman.\r\n\r\n"By a sight of the long lost, deeply regretted Charles Holland.\r\nCharles--Charles, is that indeed you, or some unsubstantial form in your\r\nlikeness?"\r\n\r\nCharles Holland, for it was, indeed, himself, heard the friendly voice\r\nof the doctor, and he called out to him.\r\n\r\n"Speak to me of Flora. Oh, speak to me of Flora, if you would not have\r\nme die at once of suspense, and all the torture of apprehension."\r\n\r\n"She lives and is well."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven. Do with me what you please."\r\n\r\nDr. Chillingworth sprang forward, and addressing the magistrate, he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Sir, I know this gentleman. He is no one of the rioters, but a dear\r\nfriend of the family of the Bannerworths. Charles Holland, what in the\r\nname of Heaven had become of you so long, and what brought you here at\r\nsuch a juncture as this?"\r\n\r\n"I am faint," said Charles; "I--I only arrived as the crowd did. I had\r\nnot strength to fight my way through them, and was compelled to pause\r\nuntil they had dispersed Can--can you give me water?"\r\n\r\n"Here\'s something better," said one of the soldiers, as he handed a\r\nflask to Charles, who partook of some of the contents, which greatly\r\nrevived him, indeed.\r\n\r\n"I am better now," he said. "Thank you kindly. Take me into the house.\r\nGood God! why is it made a point of attack? Where are Flora and Henry?\r\nAre they all well? And my uncle? Oh! what must you all have thought of\r\nmy absence! But you cannot have endured a hundredth part of what I have\r\nsuffered. Let me look once again upon the face of Flora. Take me into\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\n"Release him," said the officer, as he pointed to his head, and looked\r\nsignificantly, as much as to say, "Some mad patient of yours, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"You are much mistaken, sir," said Dr. Chillingworth; "this gentleman\r\nhas been cruelly used, I have no doubt. He has, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve, been made the victim, for a time, of the intrigues of that very\r\nSir Francis Varney, whose conduct has been the real cause of all the\r\nserious disturbances that have taken place in the country."\r\n\r\n"Confound Sir Francis Varney," muttered the officer; "he is enough to\r\nset a whole nation by the ears. However, Mr. Magistrate, if you are\r\nsatisfied that this young man is not one of the rioters, I have, of\r\ncourse, no wish to hold him a prisoner."\r\n\r\n"I can take Mr. Chillingworth\'s word for more than that," said the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland was accordingly released, and then the doctor, in\r\nhurried accents, told him the principal outlines of what had occurred.\r\n\r\n"Oh! take me to Flora," he said; "let me not delay another moment in\r\nseeking her, and convincing her that I could not have been guilty of the\r\nbaseness of deserting her."\r\n\r\n"Hark you, Mr. Holland, I have quite made up my mind that I will not\r\nleave Bannerworth Hall yet; but you can go alone, and easily find them\r\nby the directions which I will give you; only let me beg of you not to\r\ngo abruptly into the presence of Flora. She is in an extremely delicate\r\nstate of health, and although I do not take upon myself to say that a\r\nshock of a pleasurable nature would prove of any paramount bad\r\nconsequence to her, yet it is as well not to risk it."\r\n\r\n"I will be most careful, you may depend."\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a loud ringing at the garden bell, and, when it\r\nwas answered by one of the dragoons, who was ordered to do so by his\r\nofficer, he came back, escorting no other than Jack Pringle, who had\r\nbeen sent by the admiral to the Hall, but who had solaced himself so\r\nmuch on the road with divers potations, that he did not reach it till\r\nnow, which was a full hour after the reasonable time in which he ought\r\nto have gone the distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJack was not to say dumb, but he had had enough to give him a very jolly\r\nsort of feeling of independence, and so he came along quarrelling with\r\nthe soldier all the way, the latter only laughing and keeping his temper\r\nadmirably well, under a great deal of provocation.\r\n\r\n"Why, you land lubbers," cried Jack, "what do you do here, all of you, I\r\nwonder! You are all wamphighers, I\'ll be bound, every one of you. You\r\nmind me of marines, you do, and that\'s quite enough to turn a proper\r\nseaman\'s stomach, any day in the week."\r\n\r\nThe soldier only laughed, and brought Jack up to the little group of\r\npersons consisting of Dr. Chillingworth, the hangman, Charles Holland,\r\nand the officer.\r\n\r\n"Why, Jack Pringle," said Dr. Chillingworth, stepping before Charles, so\r\nthat Jack should not see him,--"why, Jack Pringle, what brings you\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"A slight squall, sir, to the nor\'west. Brought you something to eat."\r\n\r\nJack produced a bottle.\r\n\r\n"To drink, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s all one; only in this here shape, you see, it goes down\r\nbetter, I\'m thinking, which does make a little difference somehow."\r\n\r\n"How is the admiral?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s as stupid as ever; Lord bless you, he\'d be like a ship without\r\na rudder without me, and would go swaying about at the mercy of winds\r\nand waves, poor old man. He\'s bad enough as it is, but if so be I wasn\'t\r\nto give the eye to him as I does, bless my heart if I thinks as he\'d be\r\nabove hatches long. Here\'s to you all."\r\n\r\nJack took the cork from the bottle he had with him, and there came from\r\nit a strong odour of rum. Then he placed it to his lips, and was\r\nenjoying the pleasant gurgle of the liquor down his throat, when Charles\r\nstepped up to him, and laying hold of the lower end of the bottle, he\r\ndragged it from his mouth, saying,--\r\n\r\n"How dare you talk in the way you have of my uncle, you drunken,\r\nmutinous rascal, and behind his back too!"\r\n\r\nThe voice of Charles Holland was as well known to Jack Pringle as that\r\nof the admiral, and his intense astonishment at hearing himself so\r\nsuddenly addressed by one, of whose proximity he had not the least idea,\r\nmade some of the rum go, what is popularly termed, the wrong way, and\r\nnearly choked him.\r\n\r\nHe reeled back, till he fell over some obstruction, and then down he sat\r\non a flower bed, while his eyes seemed ready to come out of his head.\r\n\r\n"Avast heavings," he cried, "Who\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said Charles Holland, "don\'t pretend you don\'t know me; I\r\nwill not have my uncle spoken of in a disrespectful manner by you."\r\n\r\n"Well, shiver my timbers, if that ain\'t our nevey. Why, Charley, my boy,\r\nhow are you? Here we are in port at last. Won\'t the old commodore pipe\r\nhis eye, now. Whew! here\'s a go. I\'ve found our nevey, after all."\r\n\r\n"You found him," said Dr. Chillingworth; "now, that is as great a piece\r\nof impudence as ever I heard in all my life. You mean that he has found\r\nyou, and found you out, too, you drunken fellow. Jack, you get worse and\r\nworse every day."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir."\r\n\r\n"What, you admit it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir. Now, Master Charley, I tell you what it is, I shall take\r\nyou off to your old uncle, you shore going sneak and you\'ll have to\r\nreport what cruise you\'ve been upon all this while, leaving the ship to\r\nlook after itself. Lord love you all, if it hadn\'t been for me I don\'t\r\nknow what anybody would have done."\r\n\r\n"I only know of the result," said Dr Chillingworth, "that would ensue,\r\nif it were not for you, and that would consist in a great injury to the\r\nrevenue, in consequence of the much less consumption of rum and other\r\nstrong liquors."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged up at the yard if I understands what you mean," said\r\nJack; "as if I ever drunk anything--I, of all people in the world. I am\r\nashamed of you. You are drunk."\r\n\r\nSeveral of the dragoons had to turn aside to keep themselves from\r\nlaughing, and the officer himself could not forbear from a smile as he\r\nsaid to the doctor,--\r\n\r\n"Sir, you seem to have many acquaintances, and by some means or another\r\nthey all have an inclination to come here to-night. If, however, you\r\nconsider that you are bound to remain here from a feeling that the Hall\r\nis threatened with any danger, you may dismiss that fear, for I shall\r\nleave a picquet here all night."\r\n\r\n"No, sir," replied Dr. Chillingworth, "it is not that I fear now, after\r\nthe manner in which they have been repulsed, any danger to the Hall from\r\nthe mob; but I have reasons for wishing to be in it or near it for some\r\ntime to come."\r\n\r\n"As you please."\r\n\r\n"Charles, do not wait for or accept the guidance of that drunken fellow,\r\nbut go yourself with a direction which I will write down for you in a\r\nleaf of my pocket-book."\r\n\r\n"Drunken fellow," exclaimed Jack, who had now scrambled to his feet,\r\n"who do you call a drunken fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Why you, unquestionably."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, that is hard. Come along, nevey; I\'ll shew you where they\r\nall are. I could walk a plank on any deck with any man in the service, I\r\ncould. Come along, my boy, come along."\r\n\r\n"You can accept of him as a guide if you like, of course," said the\r\ndoctor; "he may be sober enough to conduct you."\r\n\r\n"I think he can," said Charles. "Lead on, Jack; but mark me, I shall\r\ninform my uncle of this intemperance, as well as of the manner in which\r\nyou let your tongue wag about him behind his back, unless you promise to\r\nreform."\r\n\r\n"He is long past all reformation," remarked Dr. Chillingworth; "it is\r\nout of the question."\r\n\r\n"And I am afraid my uncle will not have courage to attempt such an\r\nungrateful task, when there is so little chance of success," replied\r\nCharles Holland, shaking the worthy doctor by the hand. "Farewell, for\r\nthe present, sir; the next time I see you, I hope we shall both be more\r\npleasantly situated."\r\n\r\n"Come along, nevey," interrupted Jack Pringle; "now you\'ve found your\r\nway back, the first thing you ought to do, is to report yourself as\r\nhaving come aboard. Follow me, and I\'ll soon show yer the port where the\r\nold hulk\'s laid hisself up."\r\n\r\nJack walked on first, tolerably steady, if one may take into account his\r\ndivers deep potations, and Charles Holland, anticipating with delight\r\nagain looking upon the face of his much loved Flora, followed closely\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nWe can well imagine the world of delightful thoughts that came crowding\r\nupon him when Jack, after rather a long walk, announced that they were\r\nnow very near the residence of the object of his soul\'s adoration.\r\n\r\nWe trust that there is not one of our readers who, for one moment, will\r\nsuppose that Charles Holland was the sort of man to leave even such a\r\nvillain and double-faced hypocrite as Marchdale, to starve amid the\r\ngloomy ruins where he was immured.\r\n\r\nFar from Charles\'s intentions was any such thing; but he did think that\r\na night passed there, with no other company than his own reflections,\r\nwould do him a world of good, and was, at all events, no very great\r\nmodicum of punishment for the rascality with which he had behaved.\r\n\r\nBesides, even during that night there were refreshments in the shape of\r\nbread and water, such as had been presented to Charles himself, within\r\nMarchdale\'s reach as they had been within his.\r\n\r\nThat individual now, Charles thought, would have a good opportunity of\r\ntesting the quality of that kind of food, and of finding out what an\r\nextremely light diet it was for a strong man to live upon.\r\n\r\nBut in the morning it was Charles\'s intention to take Henry Bannerworth\r\nand the admiral with him to the ruins, and then and there release the\r\nwretch from his confinement, on condition that he made a full confession\r\nof his villanies before those persons.\r\n\r\nOh, how gladly would Marchdale have exchanged the fate which actually\r\nbefell him for any amount of personal humiliation, always provided that\r\nit brought with it a commensurate amount of personal safety.\r\n\r\nBut that fate was one altogether undreamt of by Charles Holland, and\r\nwholly without his control.\r\n\r\nIt was a fate which would have been his, but for the murderous purpose\r\nwhich had brought Marchdale to the dungeon, and those happy accidents\r\nwhich had enabled Charles to change places with him, and breathe the\r\nfree, cool, fresh air; while he left his enemy loaded with the same\r\nchains that had encumbered his limbs so cruelly, and lying on that same\r\ndamp dungeon floor, which he thought would be his grave.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned that as Charles left the ruins, the storm, which had been\r\ngiving various indications of its coming, seemed to be rapidly\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these extremely local tempests which expend all their\r\nprincipal fury over a small space of country; and, in this instance, the\r\nspace seemed to include little more than the river, and the few meadows\r\nwhich immediately surrounded it, and lent it so much of its beauty.\r\n\r\nMarchdale soon found that his cries were drowned by the louder voices of\r\nthe elements. The wailing of the wind among the ancient ruins was much\r\nmore full of sound than his cries; and, now and then, the full-mouthed\r\nthunder filled the air with such a volume of roaring, and awakened so\r\nmany echoes among the ruins, that, had he possessed the voices of fifty\r\nmen, he could not have hoped to wage war with it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, although we know that Charles Holland would have encountered\r\ndeath himself, rather than he would have willingly left anything human\r\nto expire of hunger in that dungeon, yet Marchdale, judging of others by\r\nhimself, felt by no means sure of any such thing, and, in his horror of\r\napprehension, fancied that that was just the sort of easy, and pleasant,\r\nand complete revenge that it was in Charles Holland\'s power to take, and\r\njust the one which would suggest itself, under the circumstances, to his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nCould anything be possibly more full of horror than such a thought?\r\nDeath, let it come in any shape it may, is yet a most repulsive and\r\nunwelcome guest; but, when it comes, so united with all that can add to\r\nits terrors, it is enough to drive reason from its throne, and fill the\r\nmind with images of absolute horror.\r\n\r\nTired of shrieking, for his parched lips and clogged tongue would\r\nscarcely now permit him to utter a sound higher than a whisper.\r\nMarchdale lay, listening to the furious storm without, in the last\r\nabandonment of despair.\r\n\r\n"Oh! what a death is this," he groaned. "Here, alone--all alone--and\r\nstarvation to creep on me by degrees, sapping life\'s energies one by\r\none. Already do I feel the dreadful sickening weakness growing on me.\r\nHelp, oh! help me Heav--no, no! Dare I call on Heaven to help me? Is\r\nthere no fiend of darkness who now will bid me a price for a human soul?\r\nIs there not one who will do so--not one who will rescue me from the\r\nhorror that surrounds me, for Heaven will not? I dare not ask mercy\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nThe storm continued louder and louder. The wind, it is true, was nearly\r\nhushed, but the roar and the rattle of the echo-awakening thunder fully\r\nmade up for its cessation, while, now and then, even there, in that\r\nunderground abode, some sudden reflection of the vivid lightning\'s light\r\nwould find its way, lending, for a fleeting moment, sufficient light to\r\nMarchdale, wherewith he could see the gloomy place in which he was.\r\n\r\nAt times he wept, and at times he raved, while ever and anon he made\r\nsuch frantic efforts to free himself from the chains that were around\r\nhim, that, had they not been strong, he must have succeeded; but, as it\r\nwas, he only made deep indentations into his flesh, and gave himself\r\nmuch pain.\r\n\r\n"Charles Holland!" he shouted; "oh! release me! Varney! Varney! why do\r\nyou not come to save me? I have toiled for you most unrequitedly--I have\r\nnot had my reward. Let it all consist in my release from this dreadful\r\nbondage. Help! help! oh, help!"\r\n\r\nThere was no one to hear him. The storm continued, and now, suddenly, a\r\nsudden and a sharper sound than any awakened by the thunder\'s roar came\r\nupon his startled ear, and, in increased agony, he shouted,--\r\n\r\n"What is that? oh! what is that? God of heaven, do my fears translate\r\nthat sound aright? Can it be, oh! can it be, that the ruins which have\r\nstood for so many a year are now crumbling down before the storm of\r\nto-night?"\r\n\r\nThe sound came again, and he felt the walls of the dungeon in which he\r\nwas shake. Now there could be no doubt but that the lightning had struck\r\nsome part of the building, and so endangered the safety of all that was\r\nabove ground. For a moment there came across his brain such a rush of\r\nagony, that he neither spoke nor moved. Had that dreadful feeling\r\ncontinued much longer, he must have lapsed into insanity; but that\r\namount of mercy--for mercy it would have been--was not shown to him. He\r\nstill felt all the accumulating horrors of his situation, and then, with\r\nsuch shrieks as nothing but a full appreciation of such horrors could\r\nhave given him strength to utter, he called upon earth, upon heaven and\r\nupon all that was infernal, to save him from his impending doom.\r\n\r\nAll was in vain. It was an impending doom which nothing but the direct\r\ninterposition of Heaven could have at all averted; and it was not likely\r\nthat any such perversion of the regular laws of nature would take place\r\nto save such a man as Marchdale.\r\n\r\nAgain came the crashing sound of falling stones, and he was certain that\r\nthe old ruins, which had stood for so many hundred years the storm, and\r\nthe utmost wrath of the elements, was at length yielding, and crumbling\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWhat else could he expect but to be engulphed among the\r\nfragments--fragments still weighty and destructive, although in decay.\r\nHow fearfully now did his horrified imagination take in at one glance,\r\nas it were, a panoramic view of all his past life, and how absolutely\r\ncontemptible, at that moment, appeared all that he had been striving\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nBut the walls shake again, and this time the vibration is more fearful\r\nthan before. There is a tremendous uproar above him--the roof yields to\r\nsome superincumbent pressure--there is one shriek, and Marchdale lies\r\ncrushed beneath a mass of masonry that it would take men and machinery\r\ndays to remove from off him.\r\n\r\nAll is over now. That bold, bad man--that accomplished hypocrite--that\r\nmendacious, would-be murderer was no more. He lies but a mangled,\r\ncrushed, and festering corpse.\r\n\r\nMay his soul find mercy with his God!\r\n\r\nThe storm, from this moment, seemed to relax in its violence, as if it\r\nhad accomplished a great purpose, and, consequently, now, need no longer\r\n"vex the air with its boisterous presence." Gradually the thunder died\r\naway in the distance. The wind no longer blew in blustrous gusts, but,\r\nwith a gentle murmuring, swept around the ancient pile, as if singing\r\nthe requiem of the dead that lay beneath--that dead which mortal eyes\r\nwere never to look upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF CHARLES AND FLORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles Holland followed Jack Pringle for some time in silence from\r\nBannerworth Hall; his mind was too full of thought concerning the past\r\nto allow him to indulge in much of that kind of conversation in which\r\nJack Pringle might be fully considered to be a proficient.\r\n\r\nAs for Jack, somehow or another, he had felt his dignity offended in the\r\ngarden of Bannerworth Hall, and he had made up his mind, as he\r\nafterwards stated in his own phraseology, not to speak to nobody till\r\nsomebody spoke to him.\r\n\r\nA growing anxiety, however, to ascertain from one who had seen her\r\nlately, how Flora had borne his absence, at length induced Charles\r\nHolland to break his self-imposed silence.\r\n\r\n"Jack," he said, "you have had the happiness of seeing her lately, tell\r\nme, does Flora Bannerworth look as she was wont to look, or have all the\r\nroses faded from her cheeks?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as for the roses," said Jack, "I\'m blowed if I can tell, and\r\nseeing as how she don\'t look at me much, I doesn\'t know nothing about\r\nher; I can tell you something, though, about the old admiral that will\r\nmake you open your eyes."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Jack, and what may that be?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s took to drink, and gets groggy about every day of his life,\r\nand the most singular thing is, that when that\'s the case with the old\r\nman, he says it\'s me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Jack! taken to drinking has my poor old uncle, from grief, I\r\nsuppose, Jack, at my disappearance."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think it\'s grief," said Jack; "it strikes me it\'s\r\nrum-and-water."\r\n\r\n"Alas, alas, I never could have imagined he could have fallen into that\r\nhabit of yours; he always seemed so far from anything of this kind."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, "I know\'d you\'d be astonished. It will be the\r\ndeath of him, that\'s my opinion; and the idea, you know, Master Charles,\r\nof accusing me when he gets drunk himself."\r\n\r\n"I believe that is a common delusion of intemperate persons," said\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n"Is it, sir; well, it\'s a very awkward I thing, because you know, sir,\r\nas well as most people, that I\'m not the fellow to take a drop too\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say, Jack, that I know so much, for I have certainly heard my\r\nuncle accuse you of intoxication."\r\n\r\n"Lor\', sir, that was all just on account of his trying it hisself; he\r\nwas a thinking on it then, and wanted to see how I\'d take it."\r\n\r\n"But tell me of Flora; are you quite certain that she has had no more\r\nalarms from Varney?"\r\n\r\n"What, that ere vampyre fellow? not a bit of it, your honour. Lor\' bless\r\nyou, he must have found out by some means or another that I was on the\r\nlook out, and that did the business. He\'ll never come near Miss Flora\r\nagain, I\'ll be bound, though to be sure we moved away from the Hall on\r\naccount of him; but not that I saw the good of cruising out of one\'s own\r\nlatitude, but somehow or another you see the doctor and the admiral got\r\nit into their heads to establish a sort of blockade, and the idea of the\r\nthing was to sail away in the night quite quiet, and after that take up\r\na position that would come across the enemy on the larboard tack, if so\r\nbe as he made his appearance."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you allude to watching the Hall, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir, just so; but would you believe it, Master Charlie, the\r\nadmiral and the doctor got so blessed drunk that I could do nothing with\r\n\'em."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they did indeed, and made all kinds of queer mistakes, so that the\r\nend of all that was, that the vampyre did come; but he got away again."\r\n\r\n"He did come then; Sir Francis Varney came again after the house was\r\npresumed to be deserted?"\r\n\r\n"He did, sir."\r\n\r\n"That is very strange; what on earth could have been his object? This\r\naffair is most inexplicably mysterious. I hope the distance, Jack, is\r\nnot far that you\'re taking me, for I\'m incapable of enduring much\r\nfatigue."\r\n\r\n"Not a great way, your honour; keep two points to the westward, and sail\r\nstraight on; we\'ll soon come to port. My eye, won\'t there be a squall\r\nwhen you get in. I expect as Miss Flora will drop down as dead as a\r\nherring, for she doesn\'t think you\'re above the hatches."\r\n\r\n"A good thought, Jack; my sudden appearance may produce alarm. When we\r\nreach the place of abode of the Bannerworths, you shall precede me, and\r\nprepare them in some measure for my reception."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir; do you see that there little white cottage a-head,\r\nthere in the offing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; is that the place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your honour, that\'s the port to which we are bound."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Jack, you hasten a-head, and see Miss Flora, and be sure\r\nyou prepare her gently and by degrees, you know, Jack, for my\r\nappearance, so that she shall not be alarmed."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir, I understand; you wait here, and I\'ll go and do it; there\r\nwould be a squall if you were to make your appearance, sir, all at once.\r\nShe looks upon you as safely lodged in Davy\'s locker; she minds me, all\r\nthe world, of a girl I knew at Portsmouth, called Bet Bumplush. She was\r\none of your delicate little creatures as don\'t live long in this here\r\nworld; no, blow me; when I came home from a eighteen months\' cruise,\r\nonce I seed her drinking rum out of a quart pot, so I says, \'Hilloa,\r\nwhat cheer?\' And only to think now of the wonderful effect that there\r\nhad upon her; with that very pot she gives the fellow as was standing\r\ntreat a knobber on the head as lasted him three weeks. She was too good\r\nfor this here world, she was, and too rummantic. \'Go to blazes,\' she\r\nsays to him, \'here\'s Jack Pringle come home.\'"\r\n\r\n"Very romantic indeed," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe you, sir; and that puts me in mind of Miss Flora and\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"An extremely flattering comparison. Of course I feel much obliged."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t name it, sir. The British tar as can\'t oblige a feller-cretor\r\nis unworthy to tread the quarter-deck, or to bear a hand to the distress\r\nof a woman."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Charles. "Now, as we are here, precede me, if you\r\nplease, and let me beg of you to be especially cautious in your manner\r\nof announcing me."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack: and away he walked towards the cottage,\r\nleaving Charles some distance behind.\r\n\r\nFlora and the admiral were sitting together conversing. The old man, who\r\nloved her as if she had been a child of his own, was endeavouring, to\r\nthe extent of his ability, to assuage the anguish of her thoughts, which\r\nat that moment chanced to be bent upon Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"Nevermind, my dear," he said; "he\'ll turn up some of these days, and\r\nwhen he does, I sha\'n\'t forget to tell him that it was you who stood out\r\nfor his honesty and truth, when every one else was against him,\r\nincluding myself, an old wretch that I was."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, how could you for one moment believe that those letters could\r\nhave been written by your nephew Charles? They carried, sir, upon the\r\nface of them their own refutation; and I\'m only surprised that for one\r\ninstant you, or any one who knew him, could have believed him capable of\r\nwriting them."\r\n\r\n"Avast, there," said the admiral; "that\'ll do. I own you got the better\r\nof the old sailor there. I think you and Jack Pringle were the only two\r\npersons who stood out from the first."\r\n\r\n"Then I honour Jack for doing so."\r\n\r\n"And here he is," said the admiral, "and you\'d better tell him. The\r\nmutinous rascal! he wants all the honour he can get, as a set-off\r\nagainst his drunkenness and other bad habits."\r\n\r\nJack walked into the room, looked about him in silence for a moment,\r\nthrust his hands in his breeches pockets, and gave a long whistle.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"D--me, if Charles Holland ain\'t outside, and I\'ve come to prepare you\r\nfor the blessed shock," said Jack. "Don\'t faint either of you, because\r\nI\'m only going to let you know it by degrees, you know."\r\n\r\nA shriek burst from Flora\'s lips, and she sprung to the door of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n"What!" cried the admiral, "my nephew--my nephew Charles! Jack, you\r\nrascal, if you\'re joking, it\'s the last joke you shall make in this\r\nworld; and if it\'s true, I--I--I\'m an old fool, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack; "didn\'t you know that afore?"\r\n\r\n"Charles--Charles!" cried Flora. He heard the voice. Her name escaped\r\nhis lips, and rang with a pleasant echo through the house.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was in the room, and had clasped her to his breast.\r\n\r\n"My own--my beautiful--my true!"\r\n\r\n"Charles, dear Charles!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Flora, what have I not endured since last we met; but this repays\r\nme--more than repays me for all."\r\n\r\n"What is the past now," cried Flora--"what are all its miseries placed\r\nagainst this happy, happy moment?"\r\n\r\n"D--me, nobody thinks of me," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle," said Charles, looking over Flora\'s shoulder, as he\r\nstill held her in his arms, "is that you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, swab, it is me, and you know it; but give us your five, you\r\nmutinous vagabond; and I tell you what, I\'ll do you the greatest favour\r\nI\'ve had an opportunity of doing you some time--I\'ll leave you alone,\r\nyou dog. Come along, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," said Jack; and away they went out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nAnd now those two loving hearts were alone--they who had been so long\r\nseparated by malignant destiny, once again were heart to heart, looking\r\ninto each other\'s faces with all the beaming tenderness of an affection\r\nof the truest, holiest character.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had done a favour to them both to leave them alone, although\r\nwe much doubt whether his presence, or the presence of the whole world,\r\nwould have had the effect of controlling one generous sentiment of noble\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThey would have forgotten everything but that they were together, and\r\nthat once again each looked into the other\'s eyes with all the\r\ntenderness of a love purer and higher than ordinarily belongs to mortal\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nLanguage was weak to give utterance to the full gust of happy feelings\r\nthat now were theirs. It was ecstasy enough to feel, to know that the\r\nevil fortune which had so long separated them, depriving each existence\r\nof its sunniest aspect, was over. It was enough for Charles Holland to\r\nfeel that she loved him still. It was enough for Flora Bannerworth to\r\nknow, as she looked into his beaming countenance, that that love was not\r\nmisplaced, but was met by feelings such as she herself would have\r\ndictated to be the inhabitants of the heart of him whom she would have\r\nchosen from the mass of mankind as her own.\r\n\r\n"Flora--dear Flora," said Charles, "and you have never doubted me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never doubted, Charles, Heaven or you. To doubt one would have\r\nbeen, to doubt both."\r\n\r\n"Generous and best of girls, what must you have thought of my enforced\r\nabsence! Oh! Flora, I was unjust enough to your truth to make my\r\ngreatest pang the thought that you might doubt me, and cast me from your\r\nheart for ever."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Charles, you ought to have known me better. I stood amid sore\r\ntemptation to do so much. There were those who would have urged me on to\r\nthink that you had cast me from your heart for ever. There were those\r\nready and willing to place the worst construction upon your conduct, and\r\nwith a devilish ingenuity to strive to make me participate in such a\r\nfeeling; but, no, Charles, no--I loved you, and I trusted you, and I\r\ncould not so far belie my own judgment as to tell you other than what\r\nyou always seemed to my young fancy."\r\n\r\n"And you are right, my Flora, right; and is it not a glorious triumph to\r\nsee that love--that sentiment of passion--has enabled you to have so\r\nenduring and so noble a confidence in aught human?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Charles, it is the sentiment of passion, for our love has been more\r\na sentiment than a passion. I would fain think that we had loved each\r\nother with an affection not usually known, appreciated, or understood,\r\nand so, in the vanity of my best affections, I would strive to think\r\nthem something exclusive, and beyond the common feelings of humanity."\r\n\r\n"And you are right, my Flora; such love as yours is the exception; there\r\nmay be preferences, there may be passions, and there may be sentiments,\r\nbut never, never, surely, was there a heart like yours."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Charles, now you speak from a too poetical fancy; but is it\r\npossible that I have had you here so long, with your hand clasped in\r\nmine, and asked you not the causes of your absence?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Flora, I have suffered much--much physically, but more mentally. It\r\nwas the thought of you that was at once the bane and the antidote of my\r\nexistence."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Charles! Did I present myself in such contradictory colours to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dearest, as thus. When I thought of you, sometimes, in the deep\r\nseclusion of a dungeon, that thought almost goaded me to madness,\r\nbecause it brought with it the conviction--a conviction peculiar to a\r\nlover--that none could so effectually stand between you and all evil as\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Charles; most true."\r\n\r\n"It seemed to me as if all the world in arms could not have protected\r\nyou so well as this one heart, clad in the triple steel of its\r\naffections, could have shielded you from evil."\r\n\r\n"Ay, Charles; and then I was the bane of your existence, because I\r\nfilled you with apprehension?"\r\n\r\n"For a time, dearest; and then came the antidote; for when exhausted\r\nalike in mind and body--when lying helpless, with chains upon my\r\nlimbs--when expecting death at every visit of those who had dragged me\r\nfrom light and from liberty, and from love; it was but the thought of\r\nthy beauty and thy affection that nerved me, and gave me a hope even\r\namidst the cruellest disaster."\r\n\r\n"And then--and then, Charles?"\r\n\r\n"You were my blessing, as you have ever been--as you are, and as you\r\nwill ever be--my own Flora, my beautiful--my true!"\r\n\r\nWe won\'t go so far as to say it is the fact; but, from a series of\r\nsingular sounds which reached even to the passage of the cottage, we\r\nhave our own private opinion to the effect, that Charles began kissing\r\nFlora at the top of her forehead, and never stopped, somehow or another,\r\ntill he got down to her chin--no, not her chin--her sweet lips--he could\r\nnot get past them. Perhaps it was wrong; but we can\'t help it--we are\r\nfaithful chroniclers. Reader, if you be of the sterner sex, what would\r\nyou have done?--if of the gentler, what would you have permitted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nMUTUAL EXPLANATIONS, AND THE VISIT TO THE RUINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring the next hour, Charles informed Flora of the whole particulars of\r\nhis forcible abduction; and to his surprise he heard, of course, for the\r\nfirst time, of those letters, purporting to be written by him, which\r\nendeavoured to give so bad an aspect to the fact of his sudden\r\ndisappearance from Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\nFlora would insist upon the admiral, Henry, and the rest of the family,\r\nhearing all that Charles had to relate concerning Mr. Marchdale; for\r\nwell she knew that her mother, from early associations, was so far\r\nimpressed in the favour of that hypocritical personage, that nothing but\r\ndamning facts, much to his prejudice, would suffice to convince her of\r\nthe character he really was.\r\n\r\nBut she was open to conviction, and when she really found what a villain\r\nshe had cherished and given her confidence to, she shed abundance of\r\ntears, and blamed herself exceedingly as the cause of some of the\r\nmisfortunes which had fallen upon her children.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said the admiral; "I ain\'t surprised a bit. I knew he was a\r\nvagabond from the first time I clapped eyes upon him. There was a down\r\nlook about the fellow\'s figure-head that I didn\'t like, and be hanged to\r\nhim, but I never thought he would have gone the length he has done. And\r\nso you say you\'ve got him safe in the ruins, Charles?"\r\n\r\n"I have, indeed, uncle."\r\n\r\n"And then there let him remain, and a good place, too, for him."\r\n\r\n"No, uncle, no. I\'m sure you speak without thought. I intend to release\r\nhim in a few hours, when I have rested from my fatigues. He could not\r\ncome to any harm if he were to go without food entirely for the time\r\nthat I leave him; but even that he will not do, for there is bread and\r\nwater in the dungeon."\r\n\r\n"Bread and water! that\'s too good for him. But, however, Charles, when\r\nyou go to let him out, I\'ll go with you, just to tell him what I think\r\nof him, the vagabond."\r\n\r\n"He must suffer amazingly, for no doubt knowing well, as he does, his\r\nown infamous intentions, he will consider that if I were to leave him to\r\nstarve to death, I should be but retailing upon him the injuries he\r\nwould have inflicted upon me."\r\n\r\n"The worst of it is," said the admiral, "I can\'t think what to do with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Do nothing, uncle, but just let him go; it will be a sufficient\r\npunishment for such a man to feel that, instead of succeeding in his\r\ndesigns, he has only brought upon himself the bitterest contempt of\r\nthose whom he would fain have injured. I can have no desire for revenge\r\non such a man as Marchdale."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Charles," said Flora; "let him go, and let him go with a\r\nfeeling that he has acquired the contempt of those whose best opinions\r\nmight have been his for a far less amount of trouble than he has taken\r\nto acquire their worst."\r\n\r\nExcitement had kept up Charles to this point, but now, when he arose and\r\nexpressed his intention of going to the ruins, for the purpose of\r\nreleasing Marchdale, he exhibited such unequivocal symptoms of\r\nexhaustion and fatigue that neither his uncle nor Flora would permit him\r\nto go, so, in deference to them, he gave up the point, and commissioned\r\nthe admiral and Jack, with Henry, to proceed to the place, and give the\r\nvillain his freedom; little suspecting what had occurred since he had\r\nhimself left the neighbourhood of those ruins.\r\n\r\nOf course Charles Holland couldn\'t be at all accountable for the work of\r\nthe elements, and it was not for him to imagine that when he left\r\nMarchdale in the dungeon that so awful a catastrophe as that we have\r\nrecorded to the reader was to ensue.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the ruins was not so great from this cottage even as it\r\nwas from Bannerworth Hall, provided those who went knew the most direct\r\nand best road to take; so that the admiral was not gone above a couple\r\nof hours, and when he returned he sat down and looked at Charles with\r\nsuch a peculiar expression, that the latter could not for the life of\r\nhim tell what to make of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Something has happened, uncle," he said, "I am certain; tell me at once\r\nwhat it is."\r\n\r\n"Oh! nothing, nothing," said the admiral, "of any importance."\r\n\r\n"Is that what you call your feelings?" said Jack Pringle. "Can\'t you\r\ntell him as there came on a squall last night, and the ruins have come\r\nin with a dab upon old Marchdale, crushing his guts, so that we smelt\r\nhim as soon as we got nigh at hand?"\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said Charles, "has such a catastrophe occurred?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Charles, that\'s just about the catastrophe that has occurred. He\'s\r\ndead; and rum enough it is that it should happen on the very night that\r\nyou escaped."\r\n\r\n"Rum!" said Jack, suddenly; "my eye, who mentions rum? What a singular\r\nsort of liquor rum must be. I heard of a chap as used to be fond of it\r\nonce on board a ship; I wonder if there\'s any in the house."\r\n\r\n"No!" said the admiral; "but there\'s a fine pump of spring water outside\r\nif you feel a little thirsty, Jack; and I\'ll engage it shall do you more\r\ngood than all the rum in the world."\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said Charles, "I\'m glad to hear you make that observation."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"Why, to deal candidly with you, uncle, Jack informed me that you had\r\nlately taken quite a predilection for drinking."\r\n\r\n"Me!" cried the admiral; "why the infernal rascal, I\'ve had to threaten\r\nhim with his discharge a dozen times, at least, on that very ground, and\r\nno other."\r\n\r\n"There\'s somebody calling me," said Jack. "I\'m a coming! I\'m a coming!"\r\nand, so he bolted out of the room, just in time to escape an inkstand,\r\nwhich the admiral caught up and flung after him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll strike that rascal off the ship\'s books this very day," muttered\r\nAdmiral Bell. "The drunken vagabond, to pretend that I take anything,\r\nwhen all the while it\'s himself!"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I ought certainly to have suspected the quarter from whence\r\nthe intelligence came; but he told it to me so circumstantially, and\r\nwith such an apparent feeling of regret for the weakness into which he\r\nsaid you had fallen, that I really thought there might be some truth in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"The rascal! I\'ve done with him from this moment; I have put up with too\r\nmuch from him for years past."\r\n\r\n"I think now that you have given him a great deal of liberty, and that,\r\nwith a great deal more he has taken, makes up an amount which you find\r\nit difficult to endure."\r\n\r\n"And I won\'t endure it."\r\n\r\n"Let me talk to him, and I dare say I shall be able to convince him that\r\nhe goes too far, and when he finds that such is the case he will mend."\r\n\r\n"Speak to him, if you like, but I have done with such a mutinous rascal,\r\nI have. You can take him into your service, if you like, till you get\r\ntired of him; and that won\'t be very long."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we shall see. Jack will apologise to you I have no doubt;\r\nand then I shall intercede for him, and advise you to give him another\r\ntrial."\r\n\r\n"If you get him into the apology, then there\'s no doubt about me giving\r\nhim another trial. But I know him too well for that; he\'s as obstinate\r\nas a mule, he is, and you won\'t get a civil word out of him; but never\r\nmind that, now. I tell you what, Master Charley, it will take a good lot\r\nof roast beef to get up your good looks again."\r\n\r\n"It will, indeed, uncle; and I require, now, rest, for I am thoroughly\r\nexhausted. The great privations I have undergone, and the amount of\r\nmental excitement which I have experienced, in consequence of the sudden\r\nand unexpected release from a fearful confinement, have greatly weakened\r\nall my energies. A few hours\' sleep will make quite a different being of\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, you know best," returned the admiral; "and I\'ll take\r\ncare, if you sleep till to-morrow, that you sha\'n\'t be disturbed. So now\r\nbe off to bed at once."\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his uncle\'s hand in a cordial manner, and then\r\nrepaired to the apartment which had been provided for him.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland did, indeed, stand in need of repose; and for the first\r\ntime now for many days he laid down with serenity at his heart, and\r\nslept for many hours. And was there not now a great and a happy change\r\nin Flora Bannerworth! As if by magic, in a few short hours, much of the\r\nbloom of her before-fading beauty returned to her. Her step again\r\nrecovered its springy lightness; again she smiled upon her mother, and\r\nsuffered herself to talk of a happy future; for the dread even of the\r\nvampyre\'s visitations had faded into comparative insignificance against\r\nthe heart\'s deep dejection which had come over her at the thought that\r\nCharles Holland must surely be murdered, or he would have contrived to\r\ncome to her.\r\n\r\nAnd what a glorious recompense she had now for the trusting confidence\r\nwith which she had clung to a conviction of his truth! Was it not great,\r\nnow, to feel that when he was condemned by others, and when strong and\r\nunimpeachable evidence seemed to be against him, she had clung to him\r\nand declared her faith in his honour, and wept for him instead of\r\ncondemning?\r\n\r\nYes, Flora; you were of that order of noble minds that, where once\r\nconfidence is given, give it fully and completely, and will not harbour\r\na suspicion of the faith of the loved one, a happy disposition when\r\nverified, as in this instance, by an answering truthfulness.\r\n\r\nBut when such a heart trusts not with judgment--when that pure, exalted,\r\nand noble confidence is given to an object unworthy of it--then comes,\r\nindeed, the most fearful of all mental struggles; and if the fond heart,\r\nthat has hugged to its inmost core so worthless a treasure, do not break\r\nin the effort to discard it, we may well be surprised at the amount of\r\nfortitude that has endured so much.\r\n\r\nAlthough the admiral had said but little concerning the fearful end\r\nMarchdale had come to, it really did make some impression upon him; and,\r\nmuch as he held in abhorrence the villany of Marchdale\'s conduct, he\r\nwould gladly in his heart have averted the fate from him that he had\r\nbrought upon himself.\r\n\r\nOn the road to the ruins, he calculated upon taking a different kind of\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got some distance from the cottage, Admiral Bell made a\r\nproposal to Henry to be his second while he fought Marchdale, but Henry\r\nwould not hear of it for a moment.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," he said, "could I, do you think, stand by and see a\r\nvaluable, revered, and a respected life like yours exposed to any hazard\r\nmerely upon the chance of punishing a villain? No, no; Marchdale is too\r\nbase now to be met in honourable encounter. If he is dealt with in any\r\nway let it be by the laws."\r\n\r\nThis was reasonable enough, and after some argument the admiral\r\ncoincided in it, and then they began to wonder how, without Charles,\r\nthey should be able to get an entrance to the dungeons, for it had been\r\nhis intention originally, had he not felt so fatigued, to go with them.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as they got tolerably near to the ruins, they saw what\r\nhad happened. Neither spoke, but they quickened their pace, and soon\r\nstood close to the mass of stone-work which now had assumed so different\r\na shape to what it had a few short hours before.\r\n\r\nIt needed little examination to let them feel certain that whoever might\r\nhave been in any of the underground dungeons must have been crushed to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n"Heaven have mercy upon his soul!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Amen!" said the admiral.\r\n\r\nThey both turned away, and for some time they neither of them spoke, for\r\ntheir thoughts were full of reflection upon the horrible death which\r\nMarchdale must have endured. At length the admiral said--\r\n\r\n"Shall we tell this or not?"\r\n\r\n"Tell it at once," said Henry; "let us have no secrets."\r\n\r\n"Good. Then I will not make one you may depend. I only wish that while\r\nhe was about it, Charley could have popped that rascal Varney as well in\r\nthe dungeon, and then there would have been an end and a good riddance\r\nof them both."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND NIGHT-WATCH OF MR. CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe military party in the morning left Bannerworth Hall, and the old\r\nplace resumed its wonted quiet. But Dr. Chillingworth found it difficult\r\nto get rid of his old friend, the hangman, who seemed quite disposed to\r\nshare his watch with him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, without being at all accused of being a prejudiced man,\r\nmight well object to the continued companionship of one, who, according\r\nto his own account, was decidedly no better than he should be, if he\r\nwere half so good.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it materially interfered with the proceedings of our medical\r\nfriend, whose object was to watch the vampyre with all imaginable\r\nquietness and secrecy, in the event of his again visiting Bannerworth\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n"Sir," he said, to the hangman, "now that you have so obligingly related\r\nto me your melancholy history, I will not detain you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are not detaining me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I shall probably remain here for a considerable time."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do; and one place is about the same as another to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if I must speak plainly, allow me to say, that as I came\r\nhere upon a very important and special errand, I desire most\r\nparticularly to be left alone. Do you understand me now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! ah!--I understand; you want me to go?"\r\n\r\n"Just so."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Dr. Chillingworth, allow me to tell you, I have come here\r\non a very special errand likewise."\r\n\r\n"You have?"\r\n\r\n"I have. I have been putting one circumstance to another, and drawing a\r\nvariety of conclusions from a variety of facts, so that I have come to\r\nwhat I consider an important resolve, namely, to have a good look at\r\nBannerworth Hall, and if I continue to like it as well as I do now, I\r\nshould like to make the Bannerworth family an offer for the purchase of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"The devil you would! Why all the world seems mad upon the project of\r\nbuying this old building, which really is getting into such a state of\r\ndilapidation, that it cannot last many years longer."\r\n\r\n"It is my fancy."\r\n\r\n"No, no; there is something more in this than meets the eye. The same\r\nreason, be it what may, that has induced Varney the vampyre to become so\r\ndesirous of possessing the Hall, actuates you."\r\n\r\n"Possibly."\r\n\r\n"And what is that reason? You may as well be candid with me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will, and am. I like the picturesque aspect of the place."\r\n\r\n"No, you know that that is a disingenuous answer, that you know well. It\r\nis not the aspect of the old Hall that has charms for you. But I feel,\r\nonly from your conduct, more than ever convinced, that some plot is\r\ngoing on, having the accomplishment of some great object as its climax,\r\na something of which you have guessed."\r\n\r\n"How much you are mistaken!"\r\n\r\n"No, I am certain I am right; and I shall immediately advise the\r\nBannerworth family to return, and to take up their abode again here, in\r\norder to put an end to the hopes which you, or Varney, or any one else\r\nmay have, of getting possession of the place."\r\n\r\n"If you were a man," said the hangman, "who cared a little more for\r\nyourself, and a little less for others, I would make a confidant of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I mean, candidly, that you are not selfish enough to be entitled\r\nto my confidence."\r\n\r\n"That is a strange reason for withholding confidence from any man."\r\n\r\n"It is a strange reason; but, in this case, a most abundantly true one.\r\nI cannot tell you what I would tell you, because I cannot make the\r\nagreement with you that I would fain make."\r\n\r\n"You talk in riddles."\r\n\r\n"To explain which, then, would be to tell my secret."\r\n\r\nDr. Chillingworth was, evidently, much annoyed, and yet he was in an\r\nextremely helpless condition; for as to forcing the hangman to leave the\r\nHall, if he did not feel disposed to do so, that was completely out of\r\nthe question, and could not be done. In the first place, he was a much\r\nmore powerful man than the doctor, and in the second, it was quite\r\ncontrary to all Mr. Chillingworth\'s habits, to engage in anything like\r\npersonal warfare.\r\n\r\nHe could only, therefore, look his vexation, and say,--\r\n\r\n"If you are determined upon remaining, I cannot help it; but, when some\r\none, as there assuredly will, comes from the Bannerworths, here, to me,\r\nor I shall be under the necessity of stating candidly that you are\r\nintruding."\r\n\r\n"Very good. As the morning air is keen, and as we now are not likely to\r\nbe as good company to each other as we were, I shall go inside the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nThis was a proposition which the doctor did not like, but he was\r\ncompelled to submit to it; and he saw, with feelings of uneasiness, the\r\nhangman make his way into the Hall by one of the windows.\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Chillingworth sat down to think. Much he wondered what could be\r\nthe secret of the great desire which Varney, Marchdale, and even this\r\nman had, all of them to be possessors of the old Hall.\r\n\r\nThat there was some powerful incentive he felt convinced, and he longed\r\nfor some conversation with the Bannerworths, or with Admiral Bell, in\r\norder that he might state what had now taken place. That some one would\r\nsoon come to him, in order to bring fresh provisions for the day, he was\r\ncertain, and all he could do, in the interim, was, to listen to what the\r\nhangman was about in the Hall.\r\n\r\nNot a sound, for a considerable time, disturbed the intense stillness of\r\nthe place; but, now, suddenly, Mr. Chillingworth thought he heard a\r\nhammering, as if some one was at work in one of the rooms of the Hall.\r\n\r\n"What can be the meaning of that?" he said, and he was about to proceed\r\nat once to the interior of the building, through the same window which\r\nhad enabled the hangman to gain admittance, when he heard his own name\r\npronounced by some one at the back of the garden fence, and upon casting\r\nhis eyes in that direction, he, to his great relief, saw the admiral and\r\nHenry Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"Come round to the gate," said the doctor. "I am more glad to see you\r\nthan I can tell you just now. Do not make more noise than you can help;\r\nbut, come round to the gate at once."\r\n\r\nThey obeyed the injunction with alacrity, and when the doctor had\r\nadmitted them, the admiral said, eagerly,--\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to tell us that he is here?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, not Varney; but he is not the only one who has taken a great\r\naffection for Bannerworth Hall; you may have another tenant for it, and\r\nI believe at any price you like to name."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Hush! creep along close to the house, and then you will not be seen.\r\nThere! do you hear that noise in the hall?"\r\n\r\n"Why it sounds," said the admiral, "like the ship\'s carpenter at work."\r\n\r\n"It does, indeed, sound like a carpenter; it\'s only the new tenant\r\nmaking, I dare say, some repairs."\r\n\r\n"D--n his impudence!"\r\n\r\n"Why, it certainly does look like a very cool proceeding, I must admit."\r\n\r\n"Who, and what is he?"\r\n\r\n"Who he is now, I cannot tell you, but he was once the hangman of\r\nLondon, at a time when I was practising in the metropolis, and so I\r\nbecame acquainted with him. He knows Sir Francis Varney, and, if I\r\nmistake not, has found out the cause of that mysterious personage\'s\r\ngreat attachment to Bannerworth Hall, and has found the reasons so\r\ncogent, that he has got up an affection for it himself."\r\n\r\n"To me," said Henry, "all this is as incomprehensible as anything can\r\npossibly be. What on earth does it all mean?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Henry," said the doctor, "will you be ruled by me?"\r\n\r\n"I will be ruled by any one whom I know I can trust; for I am like a man\r\ngroping his way in the dark."\r\n\r\n"Then allow this gentleman who is carpentering away so pleasantly within\r\nthe house, to do so to his heart\'s content, but don\'t let him leave it.\r\nShow yourselves now in the garden, he has sufficient prudence to know\r\nthat three constitute rather fearful odds against one, and so he will be\r\ncareful, and remain where he is. If he should come out, we need not let\r\nhim go until we thoroughly ascertain what he has been about."\r\n\r\n"You shall command the squadron, doctor," said the admiral, "and have it\r\nall your own way, you know, so here goes! Come along, Henry, and let\'s\r\nshow ourselves; we are both armed too!"\r\n\r\nThey walked out into the centre of the garden, and they were soon\r\nconvinced that the hangman saw them, for a face appeared at the window,\r\nand was as quickly withdrawn again.\r\n\r\n"There," said the doctor, "now he knows he is a prisoner, and we may as\r\nwell place ourselves in some position which commands a good view of the\r\nhouse, as well as of the garden gate, and so see if we cannot starve him\r\nout, though we may be starved out ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Not at all!" said Admiral Bell, producing from his ample pockets\r\nvarious parcels,--"we came to bring you ample supplies."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; we have been as far as the ruins."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to release Marchdale. Charles told me how the villain had fallen\r\ninto the trap he had laid for him."\r\n\r\n"He has, indeed, fallen into the trap, and it\'s one he won\'t easily get\r\nout of again. He\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"Dead!--dead!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; in the storm of last night the ruins have fallen, and he is by\r\nthis time as flat as a pancake."\r\n\r\n"Good God! and yet it is but a just retribution upon him. He would have\r\nassassinated poor Charles Holland in the cruelest and most cold-blooded\r\nmanner, and, however we may shudder at the manner of his death, we\r\ncannot regret it."\r\n\r\n"Except that he has escaped your friend the hangman," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call him my friend, if you please," said Dr. Chillingworth, "but,\r\nhark how he is working away, as if he really intended to carry the house\r\naway piece by piece, as opportunity may serve, if you will not let it to\r\nhim altogether, just as it stands."\r\n\r\n"Confound him! he is evidently working on his own account," said the\r\nadmiral, "or he would not be half so industrious."\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, a tremendous amount of hammering and noise, of one\r\nsort and another, from the house, and it was quite clear that the\r\nhangman was too heart and soul in his work, whatever may have been the\r\nobject of it, to care who was listening to him, or to what conjecture he\r\ngave rise.\r\n\r\nHe thought probably that he could but he stopped in what he was about,\r\nand, until he was so, that he might as well go on.\r\n\r\nAnd on he went, with a vengeance, vexing the admiral terribly, who\r\nproposed so repeatedly to go into the house and insist upon knowing what\r\nhe was about, that his, wishes were upon the point of being conceded to\r\nby Henry, although they were combatted by the doctor, when, from the\r\nwindow at which he had entered, out stepped the hangman.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, gentlemen! good morning," he said, and he moved towards\r\nthe garden gate. "I will not trouble you any longer. Good morning!"\r\n\r\n"Not so fast," said the admiral, "or we may bring you up with a round\r\nturn, and I never miss my mark when I can see it, and I shall not let it\r\nget out of sight, you may depend."\r\n\r\nHe drew a pistol from his pocket, as he spoke, and pointed it at the\r\nhangman, who, thereupon paused and said:--\r\n\r\n"What! am I not to be permitted to go in peace? Why it was but a short\r\ntime since the doctor was quarrelling with me because I did not go, and\r\nnow it seems that I am to be shot if I do."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the admiral, "that\'s it."\r\n\r\n"Well! but,--"\r\n\r\n"You dare," said he, "stir another inch towards the gate, and you are a\r\ndead man!"\r\n\r\nThe hangman hesitated a moment, and looked at Admiral Bell; apparently\r\nthe result of the scrutiny was, that he would keep his word, for he\r\nsuddenly turned and dived in at the window again without saying another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"Well; you have certainly stopped him from leaving," said Henry; "but\r\nwhat\'s to be done now?"\r\n\r\n"Let him be, let him be," said the doctor; "he must come out again, for\r\nthere are no provisions in the place, and he will be starved out."\r\n\r\n"Hush! what is that?" said Henry.\r\n\r\nThere was a very gentle ring at the bell which hung over the garden\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n"That\'s an experiment, now, I\'ll be bound," said the doctor, "to\r\nascertain if any one is here; let us hide ourselves, and take no\r\nnotice."\r\n\r\nThe ring in a few moments was repeated, and the three confederates hid\r\nthemselves effectually behind some thick laurel bushes and awaited with\r\nexpectation what might next ensue.\r\n\r\nNot long had they occupied their place of concealment, before they heard\r\na heavy fall upon the gravelled pathway, immediately within the gate, as\r\nif some one had clambered to the top from the outside, and then jumped\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThat this was the case the sound of footsteps soon convinced them, and\r\nto their surprise as well as satisfaction, they saw through the\r\ninterstices of the laurel bush behind which they were concealed, no less\r\na personage that Sir Francis Varney himself.\r\n\r\n"It is Varney," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," whispered the doctor. "Let him be, do not move for any\r\nconsideration, for the first time let him do just what he likes."\r\n\r\n"D--n the fellow!" said the admiral; "there are some points about him\r\nthat like, after all, and he\'s quite an angel compared to that rascal\r\nMarchdale."\r\n\r\n"He is,--he saved Charles."\r\n\r\n"He did, and not if I know it shall any harm come to him, unless he were\r\nterribly to provoke it by becoming himself the assailant."\r\n\r\n"How sad he looks!"\r\n\r\n"Hush! he comes nearer; it is not safe to talk. Look at him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nVARNEY IN THE GARDEN.--THE COMMUNICATION OF DR. CHILLINGWORTH TO THE\r\nADMIRAL AND HENRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nKind reader, it was indeed Varney who had clambered over the garden\r\nwall, and thus made his way into the garden of Bannerworth Hall; and\r\nwhat filled those who looked at him with the most surprise was, that he\r\ndid not seem in any particular way to make a secret of his presence, but\r\nwalked on with an air of boldness which either arose from a feeling of\r\nabsolute impunity, from his thinking there was no one there, or from an\r\naudacity which none but he could have compassed.\r\n\r\nAs for the little party that was there assembled, and who looked upon\r\nhim, they seemed thunderstricken by his presence; and Henry, probably,\r\nas well as the admiral, would have burst out into some sudden\r\nexclamation, had they not been restrained by Dr. Chillingworth, who,\r\nsuspecting that they might in some way give an alarm, hastened to speak\r\nfirst, saying in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, be still, fortune, you see, favours us most\r\nstrangely. Leave Varney alone. You have no other mode whatever of\r\ndiscovering what he really wants at Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have spoken," said Henry, as he drew a long breath. "If\r\nyou had not, I feel convinced that in another moment I should have\r\nrushed forward and confronted this man who has been the very bane of my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"And so should I," said the admiral; "although I protest against any\r\nharm being done to him, on account of some sort of good feeling that he\r\nhas displayed, after all, in releasing Charles from that dungeon in\r\nwhich Marchdale has perished."\r\n\r\n"At the moment," said Henry, "I had forgotten that; but I will own that\r\nhis conduct has been tinctured by a strange and wild kind of generosity\r\nat times, which would seem to bespeak, at the bottom of his heart, some\r\ngood feelings, the impulses of which were only quenched by\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"That is my firm impression of him, I can assure you," said Dr.\r\nChillingworth.\r\n\r\nThey watched Varney now from the leafy covert in which they were\r\nsituated, and, indeed, had they been less effectually concealed, it did\r\nnot seem likely that the much dreaded vampyre would have perceived them;\r\nfor not only did he make no effort at concealment himself, but he took\r\nno pains to see if any one was watching him in his progress to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHis footsteps were more rapid than they usually were, and there was\r\naltogether an air and manner about him, as if he were moved to some\r\npurpose which of itself was sufficiently important to submerge in its\r\nconsequences all ordinary risks and all ordinary cautions.\r\n\r\nHe tried several windows of the house along that terrace of which we\r\nhave more than once had occasion to speak, before he found one that\r\nopened; but at length he did succeed, and stepped at once into the Hall,\r\nleaving those, who now for some moments in silence had regarded his\r\nmovements, to lose themselves in a fearful sea of conjecture as to what\r\ncould possibly be his object.\r\n\r\n"At all events," said the admiral, "I\'m glad we are here. If the vampyre\r\nshould have a fight with that other fellow, that we heard doing such a\r\nlot of carpentering work in the house, we ought, I think, to see fair\r\nplay."\r\n\r\n"I, for one," said the doctor, "would not like to stand by and see the\r\nvampyre murdered; but I am inclined to think he is a good match for any\r\nmortal opponent."\r\n\r\n"You may depend he is," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"But how long, doctor, do you purpose that we should wait here in such a\r\nstate of suspense as to what is going on within the house?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not long; but that something will occur to make us have food for\r\naction. Hark! what is that?"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud crash within the building, as of broken glass. It\r\nsounded as if some window had been completely dashed in; but although\r\nthey looked carefully over the front of the building, they could see no\r\nevidences of such a thing having happened, and were compelled,\r\nconsequently, to come to the opinion that Varney and the other man must\r\nhave met in one of the back rooms, and that the crash of glass had\r\narisen from some personal conflict in which they had engaged.\r\n\r\n"I cannot stand this," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said the doctor; "be still, and I will tell you something,\r\nthan which there can be no more fitting time than this to reveal it."\r\n\r\n"Refers it to the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"It does--it does."\r\n\r\n"Be brief, then; I am in an agony of impatience."\r\n\r\n"It is a circumstance concerning which I can be brief; for, horrible as\r\nit is, I have no wish to dress it in any adventitious colours. Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, although under another name, is an old acquaintance of\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"Acquaintance!" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t mean to say you are a vampyre?" said the admiral; "or\r\nthat he has ever visited you?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I knew him. From the first moment that I looked upon him in\r\nthis neighbourhood, I thought I knew him; but the circumstance which\r\ninduced me to think so was of so terrific a character, that I made some\r\nefforts to chase it from my mind. It has, however, grown upon me day by\r\nday, and, lately, I have had proof sufficient to convince me of his\r\nidentity with one whom I first saw under most singular circumstances of\r\nromance."\r\n\r\n"Say on,--you are agitated."\r\n\r\n"I am, indeed. This revelation has several times, within the last few\r\ndays, trembled on my lips, but now you shall have it; because you ought\r\nto know all that it is possible for me to tell you of him who has caused\r\nyou so serious an amount of disturbance."\r\n\r\n"You awaken, doctor," said Henry, "all my interest."\r\n\r\n"And mine, too," remarked the admiral. "What can it be all about? and\r\nwhere, doctor, did you first see this Varney the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"In his coffin."\r\n\r\nBoth the admiral and Henry gave starts of surprise as, with one accord,\r\nthey exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Did you say coffin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: I tell you, on my word of honour, that the first time in my life I\r\nsaw ever Sir Francis Varney, was in his coffin."\r\n\r\n"Then he is a vampyre, and there can be no mistake," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Go on, I pray you, doctor, go on," said Henry, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I will. The reason why he became the inhabitant of a coffin was simply\r\nthis:--he had been hanged,--executed at the Old Bailey, in London,\r\nbefore ever I set eyes upon that strange countenance of his. You know\r\nthat I was practising surgery at the London schools some years ago, and\r\nthat, consequently, as I commenced the profession rather late in life, I\r\nwas extremely anxious to do the most I could in a very short space of\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes."\r\n\r\n"Arrived, then, with plenty of resources, which I did not, as the young\r\nmen who affected to be studying in the same classes as myself, spend in\r\nthe pursuit of what they considered life in London, I was\r\nindefatigable in my professional labours, and there was nothing\r\nconnected with them which I did not try to accomplish.\r\n\r\n"At that period, the difficulty of getting a subject for anatomization\r\nwas very great, and all sorts of schemes had to be put into requisition\r\nto accomplish so desirable, and, indeed, absolutely necessary a purpose.\r\n\r\n"I became acquainted with the man who, I have told you, is in the Hall,\r\nat present, and who then filled the unenviable post of public\r\nexecutioner. It so happened, too, that I had read a learned treatise, by\r\na Frenchman, who had made a vast number of experiments with galvanic and\r\nother apparatus, upon persons who had come to death in different ways,\r\nand, in one case, he asserted that he had actually recovered a man who\r\nhad been hanged, and he had lived five weeks afterwards.\r\n\r\n"Young as I then was, in comparison to what I am now, in my profession,\r\nthis inflamed my imagination, and nothing seemed to me so desirable as\r\ngetting hold of some one who had only recently been put to death, for\r\nthe purpose of trying what I could do in the way of attempting a\r\nresuscitation of the subject. It was precisely for this reason that I\r\nsought out the public executioner, and made his acquaintance, whom every\r\none else shunned, because I thought he might assist me by handing over\r\nto me the body of some condemned and executed man, upon whom I could try\r\nmy skill.\r\n\r\n"I broached the subject to him, and found him not averse. He said, that\r\nif I would come forward and claim, as next of kin and allow the body to\r\nbe removed to his house, the body of the criminal who was to be executed\r\nthe first time, from that period, that he could give me a hint that I\r\nshould have no real next of kin opponents, he would throw every facility\r\nin my way.\r\n\r\n"This was just what I wanted; and, I believe, I waited with impatience\r\nfor some poor wretch to be hurried to his last account by the hands of\r\nmy friend, the public executioner.\r\n\r\n"At length a circumstance occurred which favoured my designs most\r\neffectually,--A man was apprehended for a highway robbery of a most\r\naggravated character. He was tried, and the evidence against him was so\r\nconclusive, that the defence which was attempted by his counsel, became\r\na mere matter of form.\r\n\r\n"He was convicted, and sentenced. The judge told him not to flatter\r\nhimself with the least notion that mercy would be extended to him. The\r\ncrime of which he had been found guilty was on the increase it was\r\nhighly necessary to make some great public example, to show evil doers\r\nthat they could not, with impunity, thus trample upon the liberty of the\r\nsubject, and had suddenly, just as it were, in the very nick of time,\r\ncommitted the very crime, attended with all the aggravated circumstances\r\nwhich made it easy and desirable to hang him out of hand.\r\n\r\n"He heard his sentence, they tell me unmoved. I did not see him, but he\r\nwas represented to me as a man of a strong, and well-knit frame, with\r\nrather a strange, but what some would have considered a handsome\r\nexpression of countenance, inasmuch as that there was an expression of\r\nmuch haughty resolution depicted on it.\r\n\r\n"I flew to my friend the executioner.\r\n\r\n"\'Can you,\' I said, \'get me that man\'s body, who is to be hanged for the\r\nhighway robbery, on Monday?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' he said; \'I see nothing to prevent it. Not one soul has offered\r\nto claim even common companionship with him,--far less kindred. I think\r\nif you put in your claim as a cousin, who will bear the expense of his\r\ndecent burial, you will have every chance of getting possession of the\r\nbody.\'\r\n\r\n"I did not hesitate, but, on the morning before the execution, I called\r\nupon one of the sheriffs.\r\n\r\n"I told him that the condemned man, I regretted to say, was related to\r\nme; but as I knew nothing could be done to save him on the trial, I had\r\nabstained from coming forward; but that as I did not like the idea of\r\nhis being rudely interred by the authorities, I had come forward to ask\r\nfor the body, after the execution should have taken place, in order that\r\nI might, at all events, bestow upon it, in some sequestered spot, a\r\ndecent burial, with all the rites of the church.\r\n\r\n"The sheriff was a man not overburthened with penetration. He applauded\r\nmy pious feelings, and actually gave me, without any inquiry, a written\r\norder to receive the body from the hands of the hangman, after it had\r\nhung the hour prescribed by the law.\r\n\r\n"I did not, as you may well suppose, wish to appear more in the business\r\nthan was absolutely necessary; but I gave the executioner the sheriff\'s\r\norder for the body, and he promised that he would get a shell ready to\r\nplace it in, and four stout men to carry it at once to his house, when\r\nhe should cut it down.\r\n\r\n"\'Good!\' I said; \'and now as I am not a little anxious for the success\r\nof my experiment, do you not think that you can manage so that the fall\r\nof the criminal shall not be so sudden as to break his neck?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I have thought of that,\' he said, \'and I believe that I can manage to\r\nlet him down gently, so that he shall die of suffocation, instead of\r\nhaving his neck put out of joint. I will do my best."\r\n\r\n"\'If you can but succeed in that,\' said I, for I was quite in a state of\r\nmania upon the subject, \'I shall be much indebted to you, and will\r\ndouble the amount of money which I have already promised.\'\r\n\r\n"This was, as I believed it would be, a powerful stimulus to him to do\r\nall in his power to meet my wishes, and he took, no doubt, active\r\nmeasures to accomplish all that I desired.\r\n\r\n"You can imagine with what intense impatience I waited the result. He\r\nresided in an old ruinous looking house, a short distance on the Surrey\r\nside of the river, and there I had arranged all my apparatus for making\r\nexperiments upon the dead man, in an apartment the windows of which\r\ncommanded a view of the entrance."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I was completely ready by half-past eight, although a moment\'s\r\nconsideration of course told me that at least another hour must elapse\r\nbefore there could be the least chance of my seeing him arrive, for whom\r\nI so anxiously longed.\r\n\r\n"I can safely say so infatuated was I upon the subject, that no fond\r\nlover ever looked with more nervous anxiety for the arrival of the\r\nchosen object of his heart, than I did for that dead body, upon which I\r\nproposed to exert all the influences of professional skill, to recall\r\nback the soul to its earthly dwelling-place.\r\n\r\n"At length I heard the sound of wheels. I found that my friend the\r\nhangman had procured a cart, in which he brought the coffin, that being\r\na much quicker mode of conveyance than by bearers so that about a\r\nquarter past nine o\'clock the vehicle, with its ghastly content, stopped\r\nat the door of his house.\r\n\r\n"In my impatience I ran down stairs to meet that which ninety-nine men\r\nout of a hundred would have gone some distance to avoid the sight of,\r\nnamely, a corpse, livid and fresh from the gallows. I, however, heralded\r\nit as a great gift, and already, in imagination I saw myself imitating\r\nthe learned Frenchman, who had published such an elaborate treatise on\r\nthe mode of restoring life under all sorts of circumstances, to those\r\nwho were already pronounced by unscientific persons to be dead.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, a sort of feeling had come over me at times, knowing as I\r\ndid that the French are a nation that do not scruple at all to sacrifice\r\ntruth on the altar of vanity, that it might be after all a mere\r\nrhodomontade; but, however, I could only ascertain so much by actually\r\ntrying, so the suspicion that such might, by a possibility, be the end\r\nof the adventure, did not deter me.\r\n\r\n"I officiously assisted in having the coffin brought into the room where\r\nI had prepared everything that was necessary in the conduction of my\r\ngrand experiment; and then, when no one was there with me but my friend\r\nthe executioner, I, with his help, the one of us taking the head and the\r\nother the feet, took the body from the coffin and laid it upon a table.\r\n\r\n"Hastily I placed my hand upon the region of the heart, and to my great\r\ndelight I found it still warm. I drew off the cap that covered the face,\r\nand then, for the first time, my eyes rested upon the countenance of him\r\nwho now calls himself--Heaven only knows why--Sir Francis Varney."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said Henry, "are you certain?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\n"It may have been some other rascal like him," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"No, I am quite sure now; I have, as I have before mentioned to you,\r\ntried to get out of my own conviction upon the subject, but I have been\r\nactually assured that he is the man by the very hangman himself."\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on! Your tale certainly is a strange one, and I do not say it\r\neither to compliment you or to cast a doubt upon you, but, except from\r\nthe lips of an old, and valued friend, such as you yourself are, I\r\nshould not believe it.\'\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised to hear you say that," replied the doctor; "nor\r\nshould I be offended even now if you were to entertain a belief that I\r\nmight, after all, be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"No, no; you would not be so positive upon the subject, I well know, if\r\nthere was the slightest possibility of an error."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I should not."\r\n\r\n"Let us have the sequel, then."\r\n\r\n"It is this. I was most anxious to effect an immediate resuscitation, if\r\nit were possible, of the hanged man. A little manipulation soon\r\nconvinced me that the neck was not broken, which left me at once every\r\nthing to hope for. The hangman was more prudent than I was, and before I\r\ncommenced my experiments, he said,--\r\n\r\n"\'Doctor, have you duly considered what you mean to do with this fellow,\r\nin case you should be successful in restoring him to life?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not I,\' said I.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' he said, \'you can do as you like; but I consider that it is\r\nreally worth thinking of.\'\r\n\r\n"I was headstrong on the matter, and could think of nothing but the\r\nsuccess or the non-success, in a physiological point of view, of my plan\r\nfor restoring the dead to life; so I set about my experiments without\r\nany delay, and with a completeness and a vigour that promised the most\r\ncompletely successful results, if success could at all be an ingredient\r\nin what sober judgment would doubtless have denominated a mad-headed and\r\nwild scheme.\r\n\r\n"For more than half an hour I tried in vain, by the assistance of the\r\nhangman, who acted under my directions. Not the least symptom of\r\nvitality presented itself; and he had a smile upon his countenance, as\r\nhe said in a bantering tone,--\r\n\r\n"\'I am afraid, sir, it is much easier to kill than to restore their\r\npatients with doctors.\'\r\n\r\n"Before I could make him any reply, for I felt that his observation had\r\na good amount of truth in it, joined to its sarcasm the hanged man\r\nuttered a loud scream, and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I must own I was myself rather startled; but I for some moments longer\r\ncontinued the same means which had produced such an effect, when\r\nsuddenly he sprang up and laid hold of me, at the same time\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"\'Death, death, where is the treasure?\'\r\n\r\n"I had fully succeeded--too fully; and while the executioner looked on\r\nwith horror depicted in his countenance, I fled from the room and the\r\nhouse, taking my way home as fast as I possibly could.\r\n\r\n"A dread came over me, that the restored man would follow me if he\r\nshould find out, to whom it was he was indebted for the rather\r\nquestionable boon of a new life. I packed up what articles I set the\r\ngreatest store by, bade adieu to London, and never have I since set foot\r\nwithin that city."\r\n\r\n"And you never met the man you had so resuscitated?"\r\n\r\n"Not till I saw Varney, the vampyre; and, as I tell you, I am now\r\ncertain that he is the man."\r\n\r\n"That is the strangest yarn that ever I heard," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"A most singular circumstance," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"You may have noticed about his countenance," said Dr. Chillingworth, "a\r\nstrange distorted look?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, that has arisen from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles, in\r\nconsequence of his having been hanged. He will never lose it, and it has\r\nnot a little contributed to give him the horrible look he has, and to\r\ninvest him with some of the seeming outward attributes of the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"And that man who is now in the hall with him, doctor," said Henry, "is\r\nthe very hangman who executed him?"\r\n\r\n"The same. He tells me that after I left, he paid attention to the\r\nrestored man, and completed what I had nearly done. He kept him in his\r\nhouse for a time, and then made a bargain with him, for a large sum of\r\nmoney per annum, all of which he has regularly been paid, although he\r\ntells me he has no more idea where Varney gets it, than the man in the\r\nmoon."\r\n\r\n"It is very strange; but, hark! do you not hear the sound of voices in\r\nangry altercation?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, they have met. Let us approach the windows now. We may chance\r\nto hear something of what they say to each other."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERCATION BETWEEN VARNEY AND THE EXECUTIONER IN THE HALL.--THE\r\nMUTUAL AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was certainly a loud wrangling in the Hall, just as the doctor\r\nfinished his most remarkable revelation concerning Sir Francis Varney, a\r\nrevelation which by no means attacked the fact of his being a vampyre or\r\nnot; but rather on the contrary, had a tendency to confirm any opinion\r\nthat might arise from the circumstance of his being restored to life\r\nafter his execution, favourable to that belief.\r\n\r\nThey all three now carefully approached the windows of the Hall, to\r\nlisten to what was going on, and after a few moments they distinctly\r\nheard the voice of the hangman, saying in loud and rather angry\r\naccents,--\r\n\r\n"I do not deny but that you have kept your word with me--our bargain has\r\nbeen, as you say, a profitable one: but, still I cannot see why that\r\ncircumstance should give you any sort of control over my actions."\r\n\r\n"But what do you here?" said Varney, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"What do you?" cried the other.\r\n\r\n"Nay, to ask another question, is not to answer mine. I tell you that I\r\nhave special and most important business in this house; you can have no\r\nmotive but curiosity."\r\n\r\n"Can I not, indeed? What, too, if I have serious and important business\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible."\r\n\r\n"Well, I may as easily use such a term as regards what you call\r\nimportant business, but here I shall remain."\r\n\r\n"Here you shall not remain."\r\n\r\n"And will you make the somewhat hazardous attempt to force me to leave?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, much as I dislike lifting my hand against you, I must do so; I\r\ntell you that I must be alone in this house. I have most special\r\nreasons--reasons which concern my continued existence.\r\n\r\n"Your continued existence you talk of.--Tell me, now, how is it that you\r\nhave acquired so frightful a reputation in this neighbourhood? Go where\r\nI will, the theme of conversation is Varney, the vampyre! and it is\r\nimplicitly believed that you are one of those dreadful characters that\r\nfeed upon the life-blood of others, only now and then revisiting the\r\ntomb to which you ought long since to have gone in peace."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; what, in the name of all that\'s inexplicable, has induced you to\r\nenact such a character?"\r\n\r\n"Enact it! you say. Can you, then, from all you have heard of me, and\r\nfrom all you know of me, not conceive it possible that I am not enacting\r\nany such character? Why may it not be real? Look at me. Do I look like\r\none of the inhabitants of the earth?"\r\n\r\n"In sooth, you do not."\r\n\r\n"And yet I am, as you see, upon it. Do not, with an affected philosophy,\r\ndoubt all that may happen to be in any degree repugnant to your usual\r\nexperiences."\r\n\r\n"I am not one disposed to do so; nor am I prepared to deny that such\r\ndreadful beings may exist as vampyres. However, whether or not you\r\nbelong to so frightful a class of creatures, I do not intend to leave\r\nhere; but, I will make an agreement with you."\r\n\r\nVarney was silent; and after a few moments\' pause, the other\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"There are people, even now, watching the place, and no doubt you have\r\nbeen seen coming into it."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I was satisfied no one was here but you."\r\n\r\n"Then you are wrong. A Doctor Chillingworth, of whom you know something,\r\nis here; and him, you have said, you would do no harm to, even to save\r\nyour life."\r\n\r\n"I do know him. You told me that it was to him that I was mainly\r\nindebted for my mere existence; and although I do not consider human\r\nlife to be a great boon, I cannot bring myself to raise my hand against\r\nthe man who, whatever might have been the motives for the deed, at all\r\nevents, did snatch me from the grave."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," whispered the admiral, "there is something about that\r\nfellow that I like, after all."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Henry, "listen to them. This would all have been\r\nunintelligible to us, if you had not related to us what you have."\r\n\r\n"I have just told you in time," said Chillingworth, "it seems."\r\n\r\n"Will you, then," said the hangman, "listen to proposals?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Come along, then, and I will show you what I have been about; and I\r\nrather think you have already a shrewd guess as to my motive. This\r\nway--this way."\r\n\r\nThey moved off to some other part of the mansion, and the sound of their\r\nvoices gradually died away, so that after all, the friends had not got\r\nthe least idea of what that motive was, which still induced the vampyre\r\nand the hangman, rather than leave the other on the premises, to make an\r\nagreement to stay with each other.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done now?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Wait," said Dr. Chillingworth, "wait, and watch still. I see nothing\r\nelse that can be done with any degree of safety."\r\n\r\n"But what are we to wait for?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"By waiting, we shall, perhaps, find out," was the doctor\'s reply; "but\r\nyou may depend that we never shall by interfering."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, be it so. It seems that we have no other resource. And when\r\neither or both of those fellows make their appearance, and seem about to\r\nleave, what is to be done with them?"\r\n\r\n"They must be seized then, and in order that that may be done without\r\nany bloodshed, we ought to have plenty of force here. Henry, could you\r\nget your brother, and Charles, if he be sufficiently recovered, to\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, and Jack Pringle."\r\n\r\n"No," said the admiral, "no Jack Pringle for me; I have done with him\r\ncompletely, and I have made up my mind to strike him off the ship\'s\r\nbooks, and have nothing more to do with him."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," added the doctor, "we will not have him, then; and it is\r\njust as well, for, in all likelihood, he would come drunk, and we shall\r\nbe--let me see--five strong without him, which ought to be enough to\r\ntake prisoners two men."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry, "although one of them may be a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"That makes no difference," said the admiral. "I\'d as soon take a ship\r\nmanned with vampyres as with Frenchmen."\r\n\r\nHenry started off upon his errand, certainly leaving the admiral and the\r\ndoctor in rather a critical situation while he was gone; for had Varney\r\nthe vampyre and the hangman chosen, they could certainly easily have\r\novercome so inefficient a force.\r\n\r\nThe admiral would, of course, have fought, and so might the doctor, as\r\nfar as his hands would permit him; but if the others had really been\r\nintent upon mischief, they could, from their downright superior physical\r\npower, have taken the lives of the two that were opposed to them.\r\n\r\nBut somehow the doctor appeared to have a great confidence in the\r\naffair. Whether that confidence arose from what the vampyre had said\r\nwith regard to him, or from any hidden conviction of his own that they\r\nwould not yet emerge from the Hall, we cannot say; but certain it is, he\r\nwaited the course of events with great coolness.\r\n\r\nNo noise for some time came from the house; but then the sounds, as if\r\nworkmen were busy within it, were suddenly resumed, and with more vigour\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before Henry made the private signal which had\r\nbeen agreed upon as that which should proclaim his return; and then he\r\nand his brother, with Charles, who, when he heard of the matter, would,\r\nnotwithstanding the persuasions of Flora to the contrary, come, got\r\nquietly over the fence at a part of the garden which was quite hidden\r\nfrom the house by abundant vegetation, and the whole three of them took\r\nup a position that tolerably well commanded a view of the house, while\r\nthey were themselves extremely well hidden behind a dense mass of\r\nevergreens.\r\n\r\n"Did you see that rascal, Jack Pringle?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry; "he is drunk."\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"And we had no little difficulty in shaking him off. He suspected where\r\nwe were going; but I think, by being peremptory, we got fairly rid of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"The vagabond! if he comes here, I\'ll brain him, I will, the swab. Why,\r\nlately he\'s done nothing but drink. That\'s the way with him. He\'ll go on\r\nsometimes for a year and more, and not take more than enough to do him\r\ngood, and then all at once, for about six or eight weeks, he does\r\nnothing but drink."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we can do without him," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Without him! I should think so. Do you hear those fellows in the Hall\r\nat work? D--n me, if I haven\'t all of a sudden thought what the reason\r\nof it all is."\r\n\r\n"What--what?" said the doctor, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Why, that rascal Varney, you know, had his house burnt down."\r\n\r\n"Yes; well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, well. I dare say he didn\'t think it well. But, however, he no\r\ndoubt wants another; so, you see, my idea is, that he\'s stealing the\r\nmaterial from Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is that your notion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and a very natural one, I think, too, Master Doctor, whatever you\r\nmay think of it. Come, now, have you a better?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no, certainly not; but I have a notion that something to eat\r\nwould comfort the inward man much."\r\n\r\n"And so would something to drink, blow me if it wouldn\'t," said Jack\r\nPringle, suddenly making his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe admiral made a rush upon him; but he was restrained by the others,\r\nand Jack, with a look of triumph, said,--\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s amiss with you now? I ain\'t drunk now. Come, come, you have\r\nsomething dangerous in the wind, I know, so I\'ve made up my mind to be\r\nin it, so don\'t put yourself out of the way. If you think I don\'t know\r\nall about it, you are mistaken, for I do. The vampyre is in the house\r\nyonder, and I\'m the fellow to tackle him, I believe you, my boys."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said the doctor, "what shall we do?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Jack, as he took a bottle from his pocket and applied\r\nthe neck of it to his lips--"nothing--nothing at all."\r\n\r\n"There\'s something to begin with," said the admiral, as with his stick\r\nhe gave the bottle a sudden blow that broke it and spilt all its\r\ncontents, leaving Jack petrified, with the bit of the neck of it still\r\nin his mouth.\r\n\r\n"My eye, admiral," he said, "was that done like a British seaman? My\r\neye--was that the trick of a lubber, or of a thorough-going first-rater?\r\nfirst-rater? My eye--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise, will you; you are not drunk yet, and I was determined\r\nthat you should not get so, which you soon would with that rum-bottle,\r\nif I had not come with a broadside across it. Now you may stay; but,\r\nmark me, you are on active service now, and must do nothing without\r\norders."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, your honour," said Jack, as he dropped the neck of the bottle,\r\nand looked ruefully upon the ground, from whence arose the aroma of\r\nrum--"ay, ay; but it\'s a hard case, take it how you will, to have your\r\ngrog stopped; but, d--n it, I never had it stopped yet when it was in my\r\nmouth."\r\n\r\nHenry and Charles could not forbear a smile at Jack\'s discomfiture,\r\nwhich, however, they were very glad of, for they knew full well his\r\nfailing, and that in the course of another half hour he would have been\r\ndrunk, and incapable of being controlled, except, as on some former\r\noccasions, by the exercise of brute force.\r\n\r\nBut Jack was evidently displeased, and considered himself to be\r\ngrievously insulted, which, after all, was the better, inasmuch as,\r\nwhile he was brooding over his wrongs, he was quiet; when, otherwise, it\r\nmight have been a very difficult matter to make him so.\r\n\r\nThey partook of some refreshments, and, as the day advanced, the\r\nbrothers Bannerworth, as well as Charles Holland, began to get very\r\nanxious upon the subject of the proceedings of Sir Francis Varney in the\r\nHall.\r\n\r\nThey conversed in low tones, exhausting every, as they considered,\r\npossible conjecture to endeavour to account for his mysterious\r\npredilection for that abode, but nothing occurred to them of a\r\nsufficiently probable motive to induce them to adopt it as a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThey more than suspected Dr. Chillingworth, because he was so silent,\r\nand hazarded no conjecture at all of knowing something, or of having\r\nformed to himself some highly probable hypothesis upon the subject; but\r\nthey could not get him to agree that such was the case.\r\n\r\nWhen they challenged him upon the subject, all he would say was,--\r\n\r\n"My good friends, you perceive that, there is a great mystery somewhere,\r\nand I do hope that to-night it will be cleared up satisfactorily."\r\n\r\nWith this they were compelled to be satisfied; and now the soft and\r\nsombre shades of evening began to creep over the scene, enveloping all\r\nobjects in the dimness and repose of early night.\r\n\r\nThe noise from the house had ceased, and all was profoundly still. But\r\nmore than once Henry fancied he heard footsteps outside the garden.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned his suspicions to Charles Holland, who immediately said,--\r\n\r\n"The same thing has come to my ears."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Then it must be so; we cannot both of us have merely imagined\r\nsuch a thing. You may depend that this place is beleaguered in some way,\r\nand that to-night will be productive of events which will throw a great\r\nlight upon the affairs connected with this vampyre that have hitherto\r\nbaffled conjecture."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Charles; "there, again; I am quite confident I heard a\r\nsound as of a broken twig outside the garden-wall. The doctor and the\r\nadmiral are in deep discussion about something,--shall we tell them?"\r\n\r\n"No; let us listen, as yet."\r\n\r\nThey bent all their attention to listening, inclining their ears towards\r\nthe ground, and, after a few moments, they felt confident that more than\r\none footstep was creeping along, as cautiously as possible, under the\r\ngarden wall. After a few moments\' consultation, Henry made up his\r\nmind--he being the best acquainted with the localities of the place--to\r\ngo and reconnoitre, so he, without saying anything to the doctor or the\r\nadmiral, glided from where he was, in the direction of a part of the\r\nfence which he knew he could easily scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VAMPYRE\'S DANGER.--THE LAST REFUGE.--THE RUSE OF HENRY BANNERWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYet knowing to what deeds of violence the passions of a lawless mob will\r\nsometimes lead them, and having the experience of what had been\r\nattempted by the alarmed and infuriated populace on a former occasion,\r\nagainst the Hall, Henry Bannerworth was, reasonably enough, not without\r\nhis fears that something might occur of a nature yet highly dangerous to\r\nthe stability of his ancient house.\r\n\r\nHe did not actually surmount the fence, but he crept so close to it,\r\nthat he could get over in a moment, if he wished; and, if any one should\r\nmove or speak on the other side, he should be quite certain to hear\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments all was still, and then suddenly he heard some one\r\nsay, in a low voice,\r\n\r\n"Hist! hist! did you hear nothing?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I did," said another; "but I now am doubtful."\r\n\r\n"Listen again."\r\n\r\n"What," thought Henry, "can be the motives of these men lying secreted\r\nhere? It is most extraordinary what they can possibly want, unless they\r\nare brewing danger for the Hall."\r\n\r\nMost cautiously now he raised himself, so that his eyes could just look\r\nover the fence, and then, indeed, he was astonished.\r\n\r\nHe had expected to see two or three persons, at the utmost; what was his\r\nsurprise! to find a compact mass of men crouching down under the garden\r\nwall, as far as his eye could reach.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments, he was so surprised, that he continued to gaze on,\r\nheedless of the danger there might be from a discovery that he was\r\nplaying the part of a spy upon them.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, his first sensations of surprise were over, he cautiously\r\nremoved to his former position, and, just as he did, so, he heard those\r\nwho had before spoken, again, in low tones, breaking the stillness of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n"I am resolved upon it," said one; "I am quite determined. I will,\r\nplease God, rid the country of that dreadful man."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call him a man," said the oilier.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; it is a wrong name to apply to a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"It is Varney, after all, then," said Henry. Bannerworth, to\r\nhimself;--"it is his life that they seek. What can be done to save\r\nhim?--for saved he shall be if I can compass such an object. I feel that\r\nthere is yet a something in his character which is entitled to\r\nconsideration, and he shall not be savagely murdered while I have an arm\r\nto raise in his defence. But if anything is now to be done, it must be\r\ndone by stratagem, for the enemy are, by far, in too great force to be\r\npersonally combatted with."\r\n\r\nHenry resolved to take the advice of his friends, and with that view he\r\nwent silently and quietly back to where they were, and communicated to\r\nthem the news that he had so unexpectedly discovered.\r\n\r\nThey were all much surprised, and then the doctor said,\r\n\r\n"You may depend, that since the disappointment of the mob in the\r\ndestruction of this place, they have had their eye upon Varney. He has\r\nbeen dogged here by some one, and then by degrees that assemblage has\r\nsought the spot."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a doomed man, then," remarked the admiral; "for what can save him\r\nfrom a determined number of persons, who, by main force, will overcome\r\nus, let us make what stand we may in his defence."\r\n\r\n"Is there no hiding-place in the house," said Charles, "where you might,\r\nafter warning him of his danger, conceal him?"\r\n\r\n"There are plenty, but of what avail would that be, if they burn down\r\nthe Hall, which in all probability they will!"\r\n\r\n"None, certainly."\r\n\r\n"There is but one chance," said Henry, "and that is to throw them off\r\nthe scent, and induce them to think that he whom they seek is not here;\r\nI think that may possibly be done by boldness."\r\n\r\n"But how!"\r\n\r\n"I will go among them and make the effort."\r\n\r\nHe at once left the friends, for he felt that there might be no time to\r\nlose, and hastening to the same part of the wall, over which he had\r\nlooked so short a time before, he clambered over it, and cried, in a\r\nloud voice,\r\n\r\n"Stop the vampyre! stop the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Where, where?" shouted a number of persons at once, turning their eyes\r\neagerly towards the spot where Henry stood.\r\n\r\n"There, across the fields," cried Henry. "I have lain in wait for him\r\nlong; but he has eluded me, and is making his way again towards the old\r\nruins, where I am sure he has some hiding-place that he thinks will\r\nelude all search. There, I see his dusky form speeding onwards."\r\n\r\n"Come on," cried several; "to the ruins! to the ruins! We\'ll smoke him\r\nout if he will not come by fair means: we must have him, dead or alive."\r\n\r\n"Yes, to the ruins!" shouted the throng of persons, who up to this time\r\nhad preserved so cautious a silence, and, in a few moments more, Henry\r\nBannerworth had the satisfaction of finding that his ruse had been\r\nperfectly successful, for Bannerworth Hall and its vicinity were\r\ncompletely deserted, and the mob, in a straggling mass, went over hedge\r\nand ditch towards those ruins in which there was nothing to reward the\r\nexertions they might choose to make in the way of an exploration of\r\nthem, but the dead body of the villain Marchdale, who had come there to\r\nso dreadful, but so deserved a death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF MARCHDALE IN THE RUINS BY THE MOB.--THE\r\nBURNING OF THE CORPSE.--THE MURDER OF THE HANGMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mob reached the ruins of Bannerworth Hall, and crowded round it on\r\nall sides, with the view of ascertaining if a human creature, dead or\r\nalive, were there; various surmises were afloat, and some were for\r\nconsidering that everybody but themselves, or their friends, must be\r\nnothing less than vampyres. Indeed, a strange man, suddenly appearing\r\namong them, would have caused a sensation, and a ring would no doubt\r\nhave been formed round him, and then a hasty council held, or, what was\r\nmore probable, some shout, or word uttered by some one behind, who could\r\nnot understand what was going on in front, would have determined them to\r\ncommit some desperate outrage, and the sacrifice of life would have been\r\nthe inevitable result of such an unfortunate concurrence of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before anyone ventured among the ruins; the walls were\r\ncarefully looked to, and in more than one instance, but they were found\r\ndangerous, what were remaining; some parts had been so completely\r\ndestroyed, that there were nothing but heaps of rubbish.\r\n\r\nHowever, curiosity was exerted to such an extraordinary pitch that it\r\novercame the fear of danger, in search of the horrible; for they\r\nbelieved that if there were any one in the ruins he must be a vampyre,\r\nof course, and they were somewhat cautious in going near such a\r\ncreature, lest in so doing they should meet with some accident, and\r\nbecome vampyres too.\r\n\r\nThis was a dreadful reflection, and one that every now and then\r\nimpressed itself upon the individuals composing the mob; but at the same\r\ntime any new impulse, or a shout, and they immediately became insensible\r\nto all fear; the mere impulse is the dominant one, and then all is\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe scene was an impressive one; the beautiful house and grounds looked\r\ndesolate and drear; many of the trees were stripped and broken down, and\r\nmany scorched and burned, while the gardens and flower beds, the delight\r\nof the Bannerworth family, were rudely trodden under foot by the rabble,\r\nand all those little beauties so much admired and tended by the\r\ninhabitants, were now utterly destroyed, and in such a state that their\r\nsite could not even be detected by the former owners.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad sight to see such a sacrilege committed,--such violence\r\ndone to private feelings, as to have all these places thrown open to the\r\nscrutiny of the brutal and vulgar, who are incapable of appreciating or\r\nunderstanding the pleasures of a refined taste.\r\n\r\nThe ruins presented a remarkable contrast to what the place had been but\r\na very short time before; and now the scene of desolation was complete,\r\nthere was no one spot in which the most wretched could find shelter.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, under the lee of some broken and crumbling wall, that\r\ntottered, rather than stood, a huddled wretch might have found shelter\r\nfrom the wind, but it would have been at the risk of his life, and not\r\nthere complete.\r\n\r\nThe mob became quiet for some moments, but was not so long; indeed, a\r\nmob of people,--which is, in fact, always composed of the most\r\ndisorderly characters to be found in a place, is not exactly the\r\nassembly that is most calculated for quietness; somebody gave a shout,\r\nand then somebody else shouted, and the one wide throat of the whole\r\nconcourse was opened, and sent forth a mighty yell.\r\n\r\nAfter this exhibition of power, they began to run about like\r\nmad,--traverse the grounds from one end to the other, and then the ruins\r\nwere in progress of being explored.\r\n\r\nThis was a tender affair, and had to be done with some care and caution\r\nby those who were so engaged; and they walked over crumbling and decayed\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nIn one or two places, they saw what appeared to be large holes, into\r\nwhich the building materials had been sunk, by their own weight, through\r\nthe flooring, that seemed as roofs to some cellars or dungeons.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, they knew not how soon some other part might sink in, and\r\ncarry their precious bodies down with the mass of rubbish; this gave an\r\ninterest to the scene,--a little danger is a sort of salt to an\r\nadventure, and enables those who have taken part in it to talk of their\r\nexploits, and of their dangers, which is pleasant to do, and to hear in\r\nthe ale-house, and by the inglenook in the winter.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a few had gone some distance, others followed, when they\r\nsaw them enter the place in safety: and at length the whole ruins were\r\ncovered with living men, and not a few women, who seemed necessary to\r\nmake up the elements of mischief in this case.\r\n\r\nThere were some shouting and hallooing from one to the other as they\r\nhurried about the ruins.\r\n\r\nAt length they had explored the ruins nearly all over, when one man, who\r\nhad stood a few minutes upon a spot, gazing intently upon something,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! hurrah! here we are, altogether,--come on,--I\'ve found\r\nhim,--I\'ve found--recollect it\'s me, and nobody else has\r\nfound,--hurrah!"\r\n\r\nThen, with a wild kind of frenzy, he threw his hat up into the air, as\r\nif to attract attention, and call others round him, to see what it was\r\nhe had found.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Bill?" exclaimed one who came up to him, and who had\r\nbeen close at hand.\r\n\r\n"The matter? why, I\'ve found him; that\'s the matter, old man," replied\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n"What, a whale?\r\n\r\n"No, a wampyre; the blessed wampyre! there he is,--don\'t you see him\r\nunder them ere bricks?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s not him; he got away."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," replied the other, "who got away, or who didn\'t; I know\r\nthis much, that he\'s a wampyre,--he wouldn\'t be there if he warn\'t."\r\n\r\nThis was an unanswerable argument, and nobody could deny it;\r\nconsequently, there was a cessation of talk, and the people then came\r\nup, as the two first were looking at the body.\r\n\r\n"Whose is it?" inquired a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Not Sir Francis Varney\'s!" said the second speaker; "the clothes are not\r\nhis--"\r\n\r\n"No, no; not Sir Francis\'s"\r\n\r\n"But I tell you what, mates," said the first speaker; "that if it isn\'t\r\nSir Francis Varney\'s, it is somebody else\'s as bad. I dare say, now,\r\nhe\'s a wictim."\r\n\r\n"A what!"\r\n\r\n"A wictim to the wampyre; and, if he sees the blessed moonlight, he will\r\nbe a wampyre hisself, and so shall we be, too, if he puts his teeth into\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"So we shall,--so we shall," said the mob, and their flesh begin to run\r\ncold, and there was a feeling of horror creeping over the whole body of\r\npersons within hearing.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is; our only plan will be to get him out of the\r\nruins, then, remarked another.\r\n\r\n"What!" said one; "who\'s going to handle such cattle? if you\'ve a sore\r\nabout you, and his blood touches you, who\'s to say you won\'t be a\r\nvampyre, too!"\r\n\r\n"No, no you won\'t," said an old woman.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t try," was the happy rejoinder; "I ain\'t a-going to carry a\r\nwampyre on my two legs home to my wife and small family of seven\r\nchildren, and another a-coming."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause for a few moments, and then one man more adventurous\r\nthan the rest, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Well, vampyre, or no vampyre, his dead body can harm no one; so here\r\ngoes to get it out, help me who will; once have it out, and then we can\r\nprevent any evil, by burning it, and thus destroying the whole body.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted three or four more, as they jumped down into the hole\r\nformed by the falling in of the materials which had crushed Marchdale to\r\ndeath, for it was his body they had discovered.\r\n\r\nThey immediately set to work to displace such of the materials as lay on\r\nthe body, and then, having cleared it of all superincumbent rubbish,\r\nthey proceeded to lift it up, but found that it had got entangled, as\r\nthey called it, with some chains: with some trouble they got them off,\r\nand the body was lifted out to a higher spot.\r\n\r\n"Now, what\'s to be done?" inquired one.\r\n\r\n"Burn it," said another.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted a female voice; "we\'ve got the wampyre! run a stake\r\nthrough his body, and then place him upon some dry wood,--there\'s plenty\r\nto be had about here, I am sure,--and then burn him to a cinder."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, old woman,--that\'s right," said a man; "nothing better:\r\nthe devil must be in him if he come to life after that, I should say."\r\n\r\nThere might be something in that, and the mob shouted its approbation,\r\nas it was sure to do as anything stupid or senseless, and the proposal\r\nmight be said to have been carried by acclamation, and it required only\r\nthe execution.\r\n\r\nThis was soon done. There were plenty of laths and rafters, and the\r\nadjoining wood furnished an abundant supply of dry sticks, so there was\r\nno want of fuel.\r\n\r\nThere was a loud shout as each accession of sticks took place, and, as\r\neach individual threw his bundle into the heap, each man felt all the\r\nself-devotion to the task as the Scottish chieftain who sacrificed\r\nhimself and seven sons in the battle for his superior; and, when one son\r\nwas cut down, the man filled up his place with the exclamation,--"Another\r\nfor Hector," until he himself fell as the last of his race.\r\n\r\nSoon now the heap became prodigious, and it required an effort to get\r\nthe mangled corpse upon this funeral bier; but it was then a shout from\r\nthe mob that rent the air announced, both the fact and their\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be done was to light the pile--this was no easy task;\r\nbut like all others, it was accomplished, and the dead body of the\r\nvampyre\'s victim was thrown on to prevent that becoming a vampyre too,\r\nin its turn.\r\n\r\n"There, boys," said one, "he\'ll not see the moonlight, that\'s certain,\r\nand the sooner we put a light to this the better; for it may be, the\r\nsoldiers will be down upon us before we know anything of it; so now,\r\nwho\'s got a light?"\r\n\r\nThis was a question that required a deal of searching; but, at length\r\none was found by one of the mob coming forward, and after drawing his\r\npipe vigorously for some moments, he collected some scraps of paper upon\r\nwhich he emptied the contents of the pipe, with the hope they would take\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was doomed to disappointment; for it produced\r\nnothing but a deal of smoke, and the paper burned without producing any\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nThis act of disinterestedness, however was not without its due\r\nconsequences, for there were several who had pipes, and, fired with the\r\nhope of emulating the first projector of the scheme for raising the\r\nflame, they joined together, and potting the contents of their pipes\r\ntogether on some paper, straw, and chips, they produced, after some\r\nlittle trouble, a flame.\r\n\r\nThen there was a shout, and the burning mass was then placed in a\r\nfavourable position nearer the pile of materials collected for burning,\r\nand then, in a few moments, it began to take light; one piece\r\ncommunicated the fire to another, until the whole was in a blaze.\r\n\r\nWhen the first flame fairly reached the top, a loud and tremendous shout\r\narose from the mob, and the very welkin re-echoed with its fulness.\r\n\r\nThen the forked flames rushed through the wood, and hissed and crackled\r\nas they flew, throwing up huge masses of black smoke, and casting a\r\npeculiar reflection around. Not a sound was heard save the hissing and\r\nroaring of the flames, which seemed like the approaching of a furious\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nAt length there was nothing to be seen but the blackened mass; it was\r\nenveloped in one huge flame, that threw out a great heat, so much so,\r\nthat those nearest to it felt induced to retire from before it.\r\n\r\n"I reckon," said one, "that he\'s pretty well done by this time--he\'s had\r\na warm berth of it up there."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said another, "farmer Walkings\'s sheep he roasted whole at last\r\nharvest-home hadn\'t such a fire as this, I\'ll warrant; there\'s no such\r\nfire in the county--why, it would prevent a frost, I do believe it\r\nwould."\r\n\r\n"So it would, neighbour," answered another.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied a third, "but you\'d want such a one corner of each field\r\nthough."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was much talk and joking going on among the men who stood around,\r\nin the midst of which, however, they were disturbed by a loud shout, and\r\nupon looking in the quarter whence it came, they saw stealing from among\r\nthe ruins, the form of a man.\r\n\r\nHe was a strange, odd looking man, and at the time it was very doubtful\r\namong the mob as to whom it was--nobody could tell, and more than one\r\nlooked at the burning pile, and then at the man who seemed to be so\r\nmysteriously present, as if they almost imagined that the body had got\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n"Danged if I knows," said another, looking very hard, and very white at\r\nthe same time;--"I hope it ain\'t the chap what we\'ve burned here jist\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"No," said the female, "that you may be sure of, for he\'s had a stake\r\nthrough his body, and as you said, he can never get over that, for as\r\nthe stake is consumed, so are his vitals, and that\'s a sure sign he\'s\r\ndone for."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, she\'s right--a vampyre may live upon blood, but cannot do\r\nwithout his inside."\r\n\r\nThis was so obvious to them all, that it was at once conceded, and a\r\ngeneral impression pervaded the mob that it might be Sir Francis Varney:\r\na shout ensued.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!--After him--there\'s a vampyre--there he goes!--after him--catch\r\nhim--burn him!"\r\n\r\nAnd a variety of other exclamations were uttered, at the same time; the\r\nvictim of popular wrath seemed to be aware that he was now discovered,\r\nand made off with all possible expedition, towards some wood.\r\n\r\nAway went the mob in pursuit, hooting and hallooing like demons, and\r\ndenouncing the unfortunate being with all the terrors that could be\r\nimagined, and which naturally added greater speed to the unfortunate\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHowever, some among the mob, seeing that there was every probability of\r\nthe stranger\'s escaping at a mere match of speed, brought a little\r\ncunning to bear upon matter, and took a circuit round, and thus\r\nintercepted him.\r\n\r\nThis was not accomplished without a desperate effort, and by the best\r\nrunners, who thus reached the spot he made for, before he could get\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhen the stranger saw himself thus intercepted, he endeavoured to fly in\r\na different direction; but was soon secured by the mob, who made\r\nsomewhat free with his person, and commenced knocking him about.\r\n\r\n"Have mercy on me," said the stranger. "What do you want? I am not rich;\r\nbut take all I have."\r\n\r\n"What do you do here?" inquired twenty voices. "Come, tell us that--what\r\ndo you do here, and who are you?"\r\n\r\n"A stranger, quite a stranger to these parts."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! he\'s a stranger; but that\'s all the worse for him--he\'s a\r\nvampyre--there\'s no doubt about that."\r\n\r\n"Good God," said the man, "I am a living and breathing man like\r\nyourselves. I have done no wrong, and injured no man--be merciful unto\r\nme; I intend no harm."\r\n\r\n"Of course not; send him to the fire--take him back to the ruins--to the\r\nfire."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and run a stake through his body, and then he\'s safe for life. I am\r\nsure he has something to do with the vampyre; and who knows, if he ain\'t\r\na vampyre, how soon he may become one?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s very true; bring him back to the fire, and we\'ll try the\r\neffects of the fire upon his constitution."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, neighbour, it\'s my opinion, that as one fool makes\r\nmany, so one vampyre makes many."\r\n\r\n"So it does, so it does; there\'s much truth and reason in that\r\nneighbour; I am decidedly of that opinion, too."\r\n\r\n"Come along then," cried the mob, cuffing and pulling the unfortunate\r\nstranger with them.\r\n\r\n"Mercy, mercy!"\r\n\r\nBut it was useless to call for mercy to men whose superstitious feelings\r\nurged them on; for when the demon of superstition is active, no matter\r\nwhat form it may take, it always results in cruelty and wickedness to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nVarious were the shouts and menaces of the mob, and the stranger saw no\r\nhope of life unless he could escape from the hands of the people who\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nThey had now nearly reached the ruins, and the stranger, who was\r\ncertainly a somewhat odd and remarkable looking man, and who appeared in\r\ntheir eyes the very impersonation of their notions of a vampyre, was\r\nthrust from one to the other, kicked by one, and then cuffed by the\r\nother, as if he was doomed to run the gauntlet.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" said the mob.\r\n\r\n"I am no vampyre," said the stranger; "I am new to these parts, and I\r\npray you have mercy upon me. I have done you no wrong. Hear me,--I know\r\nnothing of these people of whom you speak."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do; you\'ve come here to see what you can do, I dare say;\r\nand, though you may have been hurt by the vampyre, and may be only your\r\nmisfortune, and not your fault, yet the mischief is as great as ever it\r\nwas or can be, you become, in spite of yourself, a vampyre, and do the\r\nsame injury to others that has been done to you--there\'s no help for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"No help,--we can\'t help it," shouted the mob; "he must die,--throw him\r\non the pile."\r\n\r\n"Put a stake through him first, though," exclaimed the humane female;\r\n"put a stake through him, and then he\'s safe."\r\n\r\nThis horrible advice had an electric effect on the stranger, who jumped\r\nup, and eluded the grasp of several hands that were stretched forth to\r\nseize him.\r\n\r\n"Throw him upon the burning wood!" shouted one.\r\n\r\n"And a stake through his body," suggested the humane female again, who\r\nseemed to have this one idea in her heart, and no other, and, upon every\r\navailable opportunity, she seemed to be anxious to give utterance to the\r\ncomfortable notion.\r\n\r\n"Seize him!" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n"Never let him go," said another; "we\'ve gone too far to hang back now;\r\nand, if he escape, he will visit us in our sleep, were it only out of\r\nspite."\r\n\r\nThe stranger made a dash among the ruins, and, for a moment,\r\nout-stripped his pursuers; but a few, more adventurous than the rest,\r\nsucceeded in driving him into an angle formed by two walls, and the\r\nconsequence was, he was compelled to come to a stand.\r\n\r\n"Seize him--seize him!" exclaimed all those at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, seeing he was now nearly surrounded, and had no chance of\r\nescape, save by some great effort, seized a long piece of wood, and\r\nstruck two of his assailants down at once, and then dashed through the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nHe immediately made for another part of the ruins, and succeeded in\r\nmaking his escape for some short distance, but was unable to keep up the\r\nspeed that was required, for his great exertion before had nearly\r\nexhausted him, and the fear of a cruel death before his eyes was not\r\nenough to give him strength, or lend speed to his flight. He had\r\nsuffered too much from violence, and, though he ran with great speed,\r\nyet those who followed were uninjured, and fresher,--he had no chance.\r\n\r\nThey came very close upon him at the corner of a field, which he\r\nendeavoured to cross, and had succeeded in doing, and he made a\r\ndesperate attempt to scramble up the bank that divided the field from\r\nthe next, but he slipped back, almost exhausted, into the ditch, and the\r\nwhole mob came up.\r\n\r\nHowever, he got on the bank, and leaped into the next field, and then he\r\nwas immediately surrounded by those who pursued him, and he was struck\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!--kill him,--he\'s one of \'em,--run a stake\r\nthrough him!" were a few of the cries of the infuriated mob of people,\r\nwho were only infuriated because he attempted to escape their murderous\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nIt was strange to see how they collected in a ring as the unfortunate\r\nman lay on the ground, panting for breath, and hardly able to\r\nspeak--their infuriated countenances plainly showing the mischief they\r\nwere intent upon.\r\n\r\n"Have mercy upon me!" he exclaimed, as he lay on the earth; "I have no\r\npower to help myself."\r\n\r\nThe mob returned no answer, but stood collecting their numbers as they\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\n"Have mercy on me! it cannot be any pleasure to you to spill my blood. I\r\nam unable to resist--I am one man among many,--you surely cannot wish to\r\nbeat me to death?"\r\n\r\n"We want to hurt no one, except in our own defence, and we won\'t be made\r\nvampyres of because you don\'t like to die."\r\n\r\n"No, no; we won\'t be vampyres," exclaimed the mob, and there arose a\r\ngreat shout from the mob.\r\n\r\n"Are you men--fathers?--have you families? if so, I have the same ties\r\nas you have; spare me for their sakes,--do not murder me,--you will\r\nleave one an orphan if you do; besides, what have I done? I have injured\r\nno one."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, friends, if we listen to him we shall all be vampyres,\r\nand all our children will all be vampyres and orphans."\r\n\r\n"So we shall, so we shall; down with him!"\r\n\r\nThe man attempted to get up, but, in doing so, he received a heavy blow\r\nfrom a hedge-stake, wielded by the herculean arm of a peasant. The sound\r\nof the blow was heard by those immediately around, and the man fell\r\ndead. There was a pause, and those nearest, apparently fearful of the\r\nconsequences, and hardly expecting the catastrophe, began to disperse,\r\nand the remainder did so very soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE VAMPYRE\'S FLIGHT.--HIS DANGER, AND THE LAST PLACE OF REFUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLeaving the disorderly and vicious mob, who were thus sacrificing human\r\nlife to their excited passions, we return to the brothers Bannerworth\r\nand the doctor, who together with Admiral Bell, still held watch over\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nNo indication of the coming forth of Varney presented itself for some\r\ntime longer, and then, at least they thought, they heard a window open;\r\nand, turning their eyes in the direction whence the sound proceeded,\r\nthey could see the form of a man slowly and cautiously emerging from it.\r\n\r\nAs far as they could judge, from the distance at which they were, that\r\nform partook much of the appearance and the general aspect of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, and the more they looked and noticed its movements, the\r\nmore they felt convinced that such was the fact.\r\n\r\n"There comes your patient, doctor," said the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call him my patient," said the doctor, "if you please."\r\n\r\n"Why you know he is; and you are, in a manner of speaking, bound to look\r\nafter him. Well, what is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"He must not, on any account," said Dr. Chillingworth, "be allowed to\r\nleave the place. Believe me, I have the very strongest reasons for\r\nsaying so."\r\n\r\n"He shall not leave it then," said Henry.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, Henry Bannerworth darted forward, and Sir Francis\r\nVarney dropped from the window, out of which he had clambered, close to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n"Hold!" cried Henry, "you are my prisoner."\r\n\r\nWith the most imperturbable coolness in the world, Sir Francis Varney\r\nturned upon him, and replied,--\r\n\r\n"And pray, Henry Bannerworth, what have I done to provoke your wrath?"\r\n\r\n"What have you done?--have you not, like a thief, broken into my house?\r\nCan you ask what you have done?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the vampyre, "like a thief, perchance, and yet no thief. May\r\nI ask you, what there is to steal, in the house?"\r\n\r\nBy the time this short dialogue had been uttered, the rest of the party\r\nhad come up, and Varney was, so far as regarded numbers, a prisoner.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen," he said, with that strange contortion of countenance\r\nwhich, now they all understood, arose from the fact of his having been\r\nhanged, and restored to life again. "Well, gentlemen, now that you have\r\nbeleaguered me in such a way, may I ask you what it is about?"\r\n\r\n"If you will step aside with me, Sir Francis Varney, for a moment," said\r\nDr. Chillingworth, "I will make to you a communication which will enable\r\nyou to know what it is all about."\r\n\r\n"Oh, with pleasure," said the vampyre. "I am not ill at present; but\r\nstill, sir, I have no objection to hear what you have to say."\r\n\r\nHe stepped a few paces on one side with the doctor, while the others\r\nwaited, not without some amount of impatience for the result of the\r\ncommunication. All that they could hear was, that Varney said,\r\nsuddenly--\r\n\r\n"You are quite mistaken."\r\n\r\nAnd then the doctor appeared to be insisting upon something, which the\r\nvampyre listened to patiently; and, at the end, burst out with,--\r\n\r\n"Why, doctor, you must be dreaming."\r\n\r\nAt this, Dr. Chillingworth at once left him, and advancing to his\r\nfriends, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney denies in toto all that I have related to you\r\nconcerning him; therefore, I can say no more than that I earnestly\r\nrecommend you, before you let him go, to see that he takes nothing of\r\nvalue with him."\r\n\r\n"Why, what can you mean?" said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Search him," said the doctor; "I will tell you why, very shortly."\r\n\r\n"Indeed--indeed!" said Sir Francis Varney. "Now, gentlemen, I will give\r\nyou a chance of behaving justly and quietly, so saving yourself the\r\ndanger of acting otherwise. I have made repeated offers to take this\r\nhouse, either as a tenant or as a purchaser, all of which offers have\r\nbeen declined, upon, I dare say, a common enough principle, namely, one\r\nwhich induces people to enhance the value of anything they have for\r\ndisposal, if it be unique, by making it difficult to come at. Seeing\r\nthat you had deserted the place, I could make no doubt but that it was\r\nto be had, so I came here to make a thorough examination of its\r\ninterior, to see if it would suit me. I find that it will not;\r\ntherefore, I have only to apologise for the intrusion, and to wish you a\r\nremarkably good evening."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"What won\'t do, sir?"\r\n\r\n"This excuse will not do, Sir Francis Varney. You are, although you deny\r\nit, the man who was hanged in London some years ago for a highway\r\nrobbery."\r\n\r\nVarney laughed, and held up his hands, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas! our good friend, the doctor, has studied too hard; his\r\nwits, probably, at the best of times, none of the clearest, have become\r\nhopelessly entangled."\r\n\r\n"Do you deny," said Henry, "then, that you are that man?"\r\n\r\n"Most unequivocally."\r\n\r\n"I assert it," said the doctor, "and now, I will tell you all, for I\r\nperceive you hesitate about searching, Sir Francis Varney, I tell you\r\nall why it is that he has such an affection for Bannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"Before you do," said Varney, "there is a pill for you, which you may\r\nfind more nauseous and harder of digestion, than any your shop can\r\nfurnish."\r\n\r\nAs Varney uttered these words, he suddenly drew from his pocket a\r\npistol, and, levelling it at the unfortunate doctor, he fired it full at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe act was so sudden, so utterly unexpected, and so stunning, that it\r\nwas done before any one could move hand or foot to prevent it. Henry\r\nBannerworth and his brother were the furthest off from the vampyre; and,\r\nunhappily, in the rush which they, as soon us possible, made towards\r\nhim, they knocked down the admiral, who impeded them much; and, before\r\nthey could spring over, or past him, Sir Francis Varney was gone.\r\n\r\nSo sudden, too, had been his departure, that they had not the least idea\r\nin which direction he had gone; so that to follow him would have been a\r\nwork of the greatest possible difficulty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, both the difficulty and the danger, for no\r\ndoubt the vampyre was well enough armed, Henry and his brother both\r\nrushed after the murderer, as they now believed him to be, in the route\r\nwhich they thought it was most probable he would take, namely, that\r\nwhich led towards the garden gate.\r\n\r\nThey reached that spot in a few moments, but all was profoundly still.\r\nNot the least trace of any one could be seen, high or low, and they were\r\ncompelled, after a cursory examination, to admit that Sir Francis Varney\r\nhad again made his escape, despite the great odds that were against him\r\nin point of numbers.\r\n\r\n"He has gone," said Henry. "Let us go back, and see into the state of\r\npoor Dr. Chillingworth, who, I fear, is a dead man."\r\n\r\nThey hurried back to the spot, and there they found the admiral looking\r\nas composed as possible, and solacing himself with a pinch of snuff, as\r\nhe gazed upon the apparently lifeless form at his feet.\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I should say he was," replied the admiral; "such a shot as that was\r\ndon\'t want to be repeated. Well, I liked the doctor with all his faults.\r\nHe only had one foolish way with him, and that was, that he shirked his\r\ngrog."\r\n\r\n"This is an awful catastrophe," said Henry, as he knelt down by the side\r\nof the body. "Assist me, some of you. Where is Charles?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged," said the admiral, "if I know. He disappeared\r\nsomewhere."\r\n\r\n"This is a night of mystery as well as terror. Alas! poor Dr.\r\nChillingworth! I little thought that you would have fallen a victim to\r\nthe man whom you preserved from death. How strange it is that you should\r\nhave snatched from the tomb the very individual who was, eventually, to\r\ntake your own life."\r\n\r\nThe brothers gently raised the body of the doctor, and carried it on to\r\nthe glass plot, which was close at hand.\r\n\r\n"Farewell, kind and honest-hearted Chillingworth," said Henry; "I shall,\r\nmany and many a time, feel your loss; and now I will rest not until I\r\nhave delivered up to justice your murderer. All consideration, or\r\nfeeling, for what seemed to be latent virtues in that strange and\r\ninexplicable man, Varney, shall vanish, and he shall reap the\r\nconsequences of the crime he has now committed."\r\n\r\n"It was a cold blooded, cowardly murder," said his brother.\r\n\r\n"It was; but you may depend the doctor was about to reveal something to\r\nus, which Varney so much dreaded, that he took his life as the only\r\neffectual way, at the moment, of stopping him."\r\n\r\n"It must be so," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"And now," said the admiral, "it\'s too late, and we shall not know it at\r\nall. That\'s the way. A fellow saves up what he has got to tell till it\r\nis too late to tell it, and down he goes to Davy Jones\'s locker with all\r\nhis secrets aboard."\r\n\r\n"Not always," said Dr. Chillingworth, suddenly sitting bolt\r\nupright--"not always."\r\n\r\nHenry and his brother started back in amazement, and the admiral was so\r\ntaken by surprise, that had not the resuscitated doctor suddenly\r\nstretched out his hand and laid hold of him by the ankle, he would have\r\nmade a precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa! murder!" he cried. "Let me go! How do I know but you may be a\r\nvampyre by now, as you were shot by one."\r\n\r\nHenry soonest recovered from the surprise of the moment, and with the\r\nmost unfeigned satisfaction, he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Thank God you are unhurt, Dr. Chillingworth! Why he must have missed\r\nyou by a miracle."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said the doctor. "Help me up--thank you--all right. I\'m\r\nonly a little singed about the whiskers. He hit me safe enough."\r\n\r\n"Then how have you escaped?"\r\n\r\n"Why from the want of a bullet in the pistol, to be sure. I can\r\nunderstand it all well enough. He wanted to create sufficient confusion\r\nto cover a desperate attempt to escape, and he thought that would be\r\nbest done by seeming so shoot me. The suddenness of the shock, and the\r\nfull belief, at the moment, that he had sent a bullet into my brains,\r\nmade me fall, and produced a temporary confusion of ideas, amounting to\r\ninsensibility."\r\n\r\n"From which you are happily recovered. Thank Heaven that, after all, he\r\nis not such a villain as this act would have made him."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the admiral, "it takes people who have lived a little in\r\nthese affairs to know the difference in sound between a firearm with a\r\nbullet in it, and one without. I knew it was all right."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you not say so, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"What was the use? I thought the doctor might be amused to know what you\r\nshould say of him, so you see I didn\'t interfere; and, as I am not a\r\ngood hand at galloping after anybody, I didn\'t try that part of the\r\nbusiness, but just remained where I was."\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas!" cried the doctor, "I much fear that, by his going, I have\r\nlost all that I expected to be able to do for you, Henry. It\'s of not\r\nthe least use now telling you or troubling you about it. You may now\r\nsell or let Bannerworth Hall to whomever you please, for I am afraid it\r\nis really worthless."\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you mean?" said Henry. "Why, doctor, will you keep up\r\nthis mystery among us? If you have anything to say, why not say it at\r\nonce?"\r\n\r\n"Because, I tell you it\'s of no use now. The game is up, Sir Francis\r\nVarney has escaped; but still I don\'t know that I need exactly\r\nhesitate."\r\n\r\n"There can be no reason for your hesitating about making a communication\r\nto us," said Henry. "It is unfriendly not to do so."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, you will excuse me for saying that you don\'t know what you\r\nare talking about."\r\n\r\n"Can you give any reason?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; respect for the living. I should have to relate something of the\r\ndead which would be hurtful to their feelings."\r\n\r\nHenry was silent for a few moments, and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"What dead? And who are the living?"\r\n\r\n"Another time," whispered the doctor to him; "another time, Henry. Do\r\nnot press me now. But you shall know all another time."\r\n\r\n"I must be content. But now let us remember that another man yet lingers\r\nin Bannerworth Hall. I will endure suspense on his account no longer. He\r\nis an intruder there; so I go at once to dislodge him."\r\n\r\nNo one made any opposition to this move, not even the doctor; so Henry\r\npreceded them all to the house. They passed through the open window into\r\nthe long hall, and from thence into every apartment of the mansion,\r\nwithout finding the object of their search. But from one of the windows\r\nup to which there grew great masses of ivy, there hung a rope, by which\r\nany one might easily have let himself down; and no doubt, therefore,\r\nexisted in all their minds that the hangman had sufficiently profited by\r\nthe confusion incidental to the supposed shooting of the doctor, to make\r\ngood his escape from the place.\r\n\r\n"And so, after all," said Henry, "we are completely foiled?"\r\n\r\n"We may be," said Dr. Chillingworth; "but it is, perhaps, going too far\r\nto say that we actually are. One thing, however, is quite clear; and\r\nthat is, no good can be done here."\r\n\r\n"Then let us go home," said the admiral. "I did not think from the first\r\nthat any good would be done here."\r\n\r\nThey all left the garden together now; so that almost for the first\r\ntime, Bannerworth Hall was left to itself, unguarded and unwatched by\r\nany one whatever. It was with an evident and a marked melancholy that\r\nthe doctor proceeded with the party to the cottage-house of the\r\nBannerworths; but, as after what he had said, Henry forbore to question\r\nhim further upon those subjects which he admitted he was keeping secret;\r\nand as none of the party were much in a cue for general conversation,\r\nthe whole of them walked on with more silence than usually characterised\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nCHARLES HOLLAND\'S PURSUIT OF THE VAMPYRE.--THE DANGEROUS INTERVIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the admiral had made a remark about Charles\r\nHolland having suddenly disappeared; and it is for us now to account for\r\nthat disappearance and to follow him to the pathway he had chosen.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that he, when Varney fired the shot at the doctor, or what\r\nwas the supposed shot, was the farthest from the vampyre; and he, on\r\nthat very account, had the clearest and best opportunity of marking\r\nwhich route he took when he had discharged the pistol.\r\n\r\nHe was not confused by the smoke, as the others were; nor was he stunned\r\nby the noise of the discharge; but he distinctly saw Varney dart across\r\none of the garden beds, and make for the summer-house, instead of for\r\nthe garden gate, as Henry had supposed was the most probable path he had\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nNow, Charles Holland either had an inclination, for some reasons of his\r\nown, to follow the vampyre alone; or, on the spur of the moment, he had\r\nnot time to give an alarm to the others; but certain it is that he did,\r\nunaided, rush after him. He saw him enter the summer-house, and pass out\r\nof it again at the back portion of it, as he had once before done, when\r\nsurprised in his interview with Flora.\r\n\r\nBut the vampyre did not now, as he had done on the former occasion, hide\r\nimmediately behind the summer-house. He seemed to be well aware that\r\nthat expedient would not answer twice; so he at once sped onwards,\r\nclearing the garden fence, and taking to the meadows.\r\n\r\nIt formed evidently no part of the intentions of Charles Holland to come\r\nup with him. He was resolved upon dogging his footsteps, to know where\r\nhe should go; so that he might have a knowledge of his hiding-place, if\r\nhe had one.\r\n\r\n"I must and will," said Charles to himself, "penetrate the mystery that\r\nhangs about this most strange and inexplicable being. I will have an\r\ninterview with him, not in hostility, for I forgive him the evil he has\r\ndone me, but with a kindly spirit; and I will ask him to confide in me."\r\n\r\nCharles, therefore, did not keep so close upon the heels of the vampyre\r\nas to excite any suspicions of his intention to follow him; but he\r\nwaited by the garden paling long enough not only for Varney to get some\r\ndistance off, but long enough likewise to know that the pistol which had\r\nbeen fired at the doctor had produced no real bad effects, except\r\nsinging some curious tufts of hair upon the sides of his face, which the\r\ndoctor was pleased to call whiskers.\r\n\r\n"I thought as much," was Charles\'s exclamation when he heard the\r\ndoctor\'s voice. "It would have been strikingly at variance with all\r\nVarney\'s other conduct, if he had committed such a deliberate and\r\nheartless murder."\r\n\r\nThen, as the form of the vampyre could be but dimly seen, Charles ran on\r\nfor some distance in the direction he had taken, and then paused again;\r\nso that if Varney heard the sound of footsteps, and paused to listen\r\nthey had ceased again probably, and nothing was discernible.\r\n\r\nIn this manner he followed the mysterious individual, if we may really\r\ncall him such, for above a mile; and then Varney made a rapid detour,\r\nand took his way towards the town.\r\n\r\nHe went onwards with wonderful precision now in a right line, not\r\nstopping at any obstruction, in the way of fences, hedges, or ditches,\r\nso that it took Charles some exertion, to which, just then, he was\r\nscarcely equal, to keep up with him.\r\n\r\nAt length the outskirts of the town were gained, and then Varney paused,\r\nand looked around him, scarcely allowing Charles, who was now closer to\r\nhim than he had been, time to hide himself from observation, which,\r\nhowever, he did accomplish, by casting himself suddenly upon the ground,\r\nso that he could not be detected against the sky, which then formed a\r\nback ground to the spot where he was.\r\n\r\nApparently satisfied that he had completely now eluded the pursuit, if\r\nany had been attempted, of those whom he had led in such a state of\r\nconfusion, the vampyre walked hastily towards a house that was to let,\r\nand which was only to be reached by going up an avenue of trees, and\r\nthen unlocking a gate in a wall which bounded the premises next to the\r\navenue. But the vampyre appeared to be possessed of every facility for\r\neffecting an entrance to the place and, producing from his pocket a key,\r\nhe at once opened the gate, and disappeared within the precincts of\r\nthose premises.\r\n\r\nHe, no doubt, felt that he was hunted by the mob of the town, and hence\r\nhis frequent change of residence, since his own had been burnt down,\r\nand, indeed, situated as he was, there can be no manner of doubt that he\r\nwould have been sacrificed to the superstitious fury of the populace, if\r\nthey could but have got hold of him.\r\n\r\nHe had, from his knowledge, which was no doubt accurate and complete, of\r\nwhat had been done, a good idea of what his own fate would be, were he\r\nto fall into the hands of that ferocious multitude, each individual\r\ncomposing which, felt a conviction that there would be no peace, nor\r\nhope of prosperity or happiness, on the place, until he, the arch\r\nvampyre of all the supposed vampyres, was destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles did pause for a few moments, after having thus become roused, to\r\nconsider whether he should then attempt to have the interview he had\r\nresolved upon having by some means or another, or defer it, now that he\r\nknew where Varney was to be found, until another time.\r\n\r\nBut when he came to consider how extremely likely it was that, even in\r\nthe course of a few hours, Varney might shift his abode for some good\r\nand substantial reasons, he at once determined upon attempting to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut how to accomplish such a purpose was not the easiest question in the\r\nworld to answer. If he rung the bell that presented itself above the\r\ngarden gate, was it at all likely that Varney, who had come there for\r\nconcealment, would pay any attention to the summons?\r\n\r\nAfter some consideration, he did, however, think of a plan by which, at\r\nall events, he could ensure effecting an entrance into the premises, and\r\nthen he would take his chance of finding the mysterious being whom he\r\nsought, and who probably might have no particular objection to meeting\r\nwith him, Charles Holland, because their last interview in the ruins\r\ncould not be said to be otherwise than of a peaceable and calm enough\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHe saw by the board, which was nailed in the front of the house, that\r\nall applications to see it were to be made to a Mr. Nash, residing close\r\nat hand; and, as Charles had the appearance of a respectable person, he\r\nthought he might possibly have the key entrusted to him, ostensibly to\r\nlook at the house, preparatory possibly to taking it, and so he should,\r\nat all events, obtain admission.\r\n\r\nHe, accordingly, went at once to this Mr. Nash, and asked about the\r\nhouse; of course he had to affect an interest in its rental and\r\naccommodations, which he did not feel, in order to lull any suspicion,\r\nand, finally, he said,--\r\n\r\n"I should like to look over it if you will lend me the key, which I will\r\nshortly bring back to you."\r\n\r\nThere was an evident hesitation about the agent when this proposal was\r\ncommunicated by Charles Holland, and he said,--\r\n\r\n"I dare say, sir, you wonder that I don\'t say yes, at once; but the fact\r\nis there came a gentleman here one day when I was out, and got a key,\r\nfor we have two to open the house, from my wife, and he never came back\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nThat this was the means by which Varney, the vampyre, had obtained the\r\nkey, by the aid of which Charles had seen him effect so immediate an\r\nentrance to the house, there could be no doubt.\r\n\r\n"How long ago were you served that trick?" he said.\r\n\r\n"About two days ago, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, it only shows how, when one person acts wrongly, another is at\r\nonce suspected of a capability to do so likewise. There is my name and\r\nmy address; I should like rather to go alone to see the house, because I\r\nalways fancy I can judge better by myself of the accommodation, and I\r\ncan stay as long as I like, and ascertain the sizes of all the rooms\r\nwithout the disagreeable feeling upon my mind, which no amount of\r\ncomplaisance on your part, could ever get me over, that I was most\r\nunaccountably detaining somebody from more important business of their\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I assure you, sir," said Mr. Nash, "that I should not be at all\r\nimpatient. But if you would rather go alone--"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I would."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, sir, there is the key. A gentleman who leaves his name and\r\naddress, of course, we can have no objection to. I only told you of what\r\nhappened, sir, in the mere way of conversation, and I hope you won\'t\r\nimagine for a moment that I meant to insinuate that you were going to\r\nkeep the key."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly not--certainly not," said Charles, who was only too glad\r\nto get the key upon any terms. "You are quite right, and I beg you will\r\nsay no more about it; I quite understand."\r\n\r\nHe then walked off to the empty house again, and, proceeding to the\r\navenue, he fitted the key to the lock, and had the satisfaction of\r\nfinding the gate instantly yield to him.\r\n\r\nWhen he passed through it, and closed the door after him, which he did\r\ncarefully, he found himself in a handsomely laid-out garden, and saw the\r\nhouse a short distance in front of him, standing upon a well got-up\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nHe cared not if Varney should see him before he reached the house,\r\nbecause the fact was sufficiently evident to himself that after all he\r\ncould not actually enforce an interview with the vampyre. He only hoped\r\nthat as he had found him out it would be conceded to him.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, walked up the lawn without making the least attempt at\r\nconcealment, and when he reached the house he allowed his footsteps to\r\nmake what noise they would upon the stone steps which led up to it. But\r\nno one appeared; nor was there, either by sight or by sound, any\r\nindication of the presence of any living being in the place besides\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nInsensibly, as he contemplated the deserted place around him, the solemn\r\nsort of stillness began to have its effect upon his imagination, and,\r\nwithout being aware that he did so, he had, with softness and caution,\r\nglided onwards, as if he were bent on some errand requiring the utmost\r\namount of caution and discrimination in the conduction of it.\r\n\r\nAnd so he entered the hall of the house, where he stood some time, and\r\nlistened with the greatest attention, without, however, being able to\r\nhear the least sound throughout the whole of the house.\r\n\r\n"And yet he must be here," thought Charles to himself; "I was not gone\r\nmany minutes, and it is extremely unlikely that in so short a space of\r\ntime he has left, after taking so much trouble, by making such a detour\r\naround the meadows to get here, without being observed. I will examine\r\nevery room in the place, but I will find him."\r\n\r\nCharles immediately commenced going from room to room of that house in\r\nhis search for the vampyre. There were but four apartments upon the\r\nground floor, and these, of course, he quickly ran through. Nothing\r\nwhatever at all indicative of any one having been there met his gaze,\r\nand with a feeling of disappointment creeping over him, he commenced the\r\nascent of the staircase.\r\n\r\nThe day had now fairly commenced, so that there was abundance of light,\r\nalthough, even for the country, it was an early hour, and probably Mr.\r\nNash had been not a little surprised to have a call from one whose\r\nappearance bespoke no necessity for rising with the lark at such an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations, however, sank into insignificance in Charles\'s\r\nmind, compared with the object he had in view, namely, the unravelling\r\nthe many mysteries that hung around that man. He ascended to the landing\r\nof the first story, and then, as he could have no choice, he opened the\r\nfirst door that his eyes fell upon, and entered a tolerably large\r\napartment. It was quite destitute of furniture, and at the moment\r\nCharles was about to pronounce it empty; but then his eyes fell upon a\r\nlarge black-looking bundle of something, that seemed to be lying jammed\r\nup under the window on the floor--that being the place of all others in\r\nthe room which was enveloped in the most shadow.\r\n\r\nHe started back involuntarily at the moment, for the appearance was one\r\nso shapeless, that there was no such thing as defining, from even that\r\ndistance, what it really was.\r\n\r\nThen he slowly and cautiously approached it, as we always approach that\r\nof the character of which we are ignorant, and concerning the powers of\r\nwhich to do injury we can consequently have no defined idea.\r\n\r\nThat it was a human form there, was the first tangible opinion he had\r\nabout it; and from its profound stillness, and the manner in which it\r\nseemed to be laid close under the window, he thought that he was surely\r\nupon the point of finding out that some deed of blood had been\r\ncommitted, the unfortunate victim of which was now lying before him.\r\n\r\nUpon a nearer examination, he found that the whole body, including the\r\ngreater part of the head and face, was wrapped in a large cloak; and\r\nthere, as he gazed, he soon found cause to correct his first opinion at\r\nto the form belonging to the dead, for he could distinctly hear the\r\nregular breathing, as of some one in a sound and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nCloser he went, and closer still. Then, as he clasped his hands, he\r\nsaid, in a voice scarcely above a whisper,--\r\n\r\n"It is--it is the vampyre."\r\n\r\nYes, there could be no doubt of the fact. It was Sir Francis Varney who\r\nlay there, enveloped in the huge horseman\'s cloak, in which, on two or\r\nthree occasions during the progress of this narrative, he had figured.\r\nThere he lay, at the mercy completely of any arm that might be raised\r\nagainst him, apparently so overcome by fatigue that no ordinary noise\r\nwould have awakened him.\r\n\r\nWell might Charles Holland gaze at him with mingled feelings. There lay\r\nthe being who had done almost enough to drive the beautiful Flora\r\nBannerworth distracted--the being who had compelled the Bannerworth\r\nfamily to leave their ancient house, to which they had been bound by\r\nevery description of association. The same mysterious existence, too,\r\nwho, the better to carry on his plots and plans, had, by dint of\r\nviolence, immured him, Charles, in a dungeon, and loaded him with\r\nchains. There he lay sleeping, and at his mercy.\r\n\r\n"Shall I awaken him," said Charles, "or let him sleep off the fatigue,\r\nwhich, no doubt, is weighing down his limbs, and setting heavily on his\r\neyelids. No, my business with him is too urgent."\r\n\r\nHe then raised his voice, and cried,--\r\n\r\n"Varney, Varney, awake!"\r\n\r\nThe sound disturbed, without altogether breaking up, the deep slumber of\r\nthe vampyre, and he uttered a low moan, and moved one hand restlessly.\r\nThen, as if that disturbance of the calm and deep repose which had sat\r\nupon him, had given at once the reins to fancy, he begin to mutter\r\nstrange words in his sleep, some of which could be heard by Charles\r\ndistinctly, while others were too incoherently uttered to be clearly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?" he said; "where--where hidden?--Pull the house\r\ndown!--Murder! No, no, no! no murder!--I will not, I dare not. Blood\r\nenough is upon my hands.--The money!--the money! Down, villains! down!\r\ndown! down!"\r\n\r\nWhat these incoherent words alluded to specifically, Charles, of course,\r\ncould not have the least idea, but he listened attentively, with a hope\r\nthat something might fall from his lips that would afford a key to some\r\nof the mysterious circumstances with which he was so intimately\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nNow, however, there was a longer silence than before, only broken\r\noccasionally by low moans; but suddenly, as Charles was thinking of\r\nagain speaking, he uttered some more disjointed sentences.\r\n\r\n"No harm," he said, "no harm,--Marchdale is a villain!--Not a hair of\r\nhis head injured--no, no. Set him free--yes, I will set him free.\r\nBeware! beware, Marchdale! and you Mortimer. The scaffold! ay, the\r\nscaffold! but where is the bright gold? The memory of the deed of blood\r\nwill not cling to it. Where is it hidden? The gold! the gold! the gold!\r\nIt is not in the grave--it cannot be there--no, no, no!--not there, not\r\nthere! Load the pistols. There, there! Down, villain, down!--down,\r\ndown!"\r\n\r\nDespairing, now, of obtaining anything like tangible information from\r\nthese ravings, which, even if they did, by accident, so connect\r\nthemselves together as to seem to mean something, Charles again cried\r\naloud,--\r\n\r\n"Varney, awake, awake!"\r\n\r\nBut, as before, the sleeping man was sufficiently deaf to the cry to\r\nremain, with his eyes closed, still in a disturbed slumber, but yet a\r\nslumber which might last for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n"I have heard," said Charles, "that there are many persons whom no noise\r\nwill awaken, while the slightest touch rouses them in an instant. I will\r\ntry that upon this slumbering being."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he advanced close to Sir Francis Varney, and touched him\r\nslightly with the toe of his boot.\r\n\r\nThe effect was as startling as it was instantaneous. The vampyre sprang\r\nto his feet, as he had been suddenly impelled up by some powerful\r\nmachinery; and, casting his cloak away from his arms, so as to have them\r\nat liberty, he sprang upon Charles Holland, and hurled him to the\r\nground, where he held him with a giant\'s gripe, as he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Rash fool! be you whom you may. Why have you troubled me to rid the\r\nworld of your intrusive existence?"\r\n\r\nThe attack was so sudden and so terrific, that resistance to it, even if\r\nCharles had had the power, was out of the question. All he could say,\r\nwas,--\r\n\r\n"Varney, Varney! do you not know me? I am Charles Holland. Will you now,\r\nin your mad rage, take the life you might more easily have taken when I\r\nlay in the dungeon from which you released me?"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice at once convinced Sir Francis Varney of his\r\nidentity; and it was with a voice that had some tones of regret in it,\r\nthat he replied,--\r\n\r\n"And wherefore have you thought proper, when you were once free and\r\nunscathed, to cast yourself into such a position of danger as to follow\r\nme to my haunt?"\r\n\r\n"I contemplated no danger," said Charles, "because I contemplated no\r\nevil. I do not know why you should kill me."\r\n\r\n"You came here, and yet you say you do not know why I should kill you.\r\nYoung man, have you a dozen lives that you can afford to tamper with\r\nthem thus? I have, at much chance of imminence to myself, already once\r\nsaved you, when another, with a sterner feeling, would have gladly taken\r\nyour life; but now, as if you were determined to goad me to an act which\r\nI have shunned committing, you will not let me close my eyes in peace."\r\n\r\n"Take your hand from off my throat, Varney, and I will then tell you\r\nwhat brought me here."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney did so.\r\n\r\n"Rise," he said--"rise; I have seen blood enough to be sickened at the\r\nprospect of more; but you should not have come here and tempted me."\r\n\r\n"Nay, believe me, I came here for good and not for evil. Sir Francis\r\nVarney, hear me out, and then judge for yourself whether you can blame\r\nthe perseverance which enabled me to find out this secret place of\r\nrefuge; but let me first say that now it is as good a place of\r\nconcealment to you as before it was, for I shall not betray you."\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on. What is it you desire?"\r\n\r\n"During the long and weary hours of my captivity, I thought deeply, and\r\npainfully too, as may be well imagined, of all the circumstances\r\nconnected with your appearance at Bannerworth Hall, and your subsequent\r\nconduct. Then I felt convinced that there was something far more than\r\nmet the eye, in the whole affair, and, from what I have been informed of\r\nsince, I am the more convinced that some secret, some mystery, which it\r\nis in your power only perhaps to explain, lurks at the bottom of all\r\nyour conduct."\r\n\r\n"Well, proceed," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Have I not said enough now to enable you to divine the object of my\r\nvisit? It is that you should shake off the trammels of mystery in which\r\nyou have shrouded yourself, and declare what it is you want, what it is\r\nyou desire, that has induced you to set yourself up as such a determined\r\nfoe of the Bannerworth family."\r\n\r\n"And that, you say, is the modest request that brings you here?"\r\n\r\n"You speak as if you thought it was idle curiosity that prompts me, but\r\nyou know it is not. Your language and manner are those of a man of too\r\nmuch sagacity not to see that I have higher notions."\r\n\r\n"Name them."\r\n\r\n"You have yourself, in more than one instance, behaved with a strange\r\nsort of romantic generosity, as if, but for some great object which you\r\nfelt impelled to seek by any means, and at any sacrifice, you would be a\r\nsomething in character and conduct very different from what you are. One\r\nof my objects, then, is to awaken that better nature which is slumbering\r\nwithin you, only now and then rousing itself to do some deed which\r\nshould be the character of all your actions--for your own sake I have\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"But not wholly?"\r\n\r\n"Not wholly, as you say. There is another than whom, the whole world is\r\nnot so dear to me. That other one was serene as she was beautiful.\r\nHappiness danced in her eyes, and she ought--for not more lovely is the\r\nmind that she possesses than the glorious form that enshrines it--to be\r\nhappy. Her life should have passed like one long summer\'s day of beauty,\r\nsunshine, and pure heavenly enjoyment. You have poisoned the cup of joy\r\nthat the great God of nature had permitted her to place to her lips and\r\ntaste of mistrustingly. Why have you done this? I ask you--why have you\r\ndone this?"\r\n\r\n"Have you said all that you came to say?"\r\n\r\n"I have spoken the substance of my message. Much could I elaborate upon\r\nsuch a theme; but it is not one, Varney, which is congenial to my heart;\r\nfor your sake, however, and for the sakes of those whom I hold most\r\ndear, let me implore you to act in this matter with a kindly\r\nconsideration. Proclaim your motives; you cannot say that they are not\r\nsuch as we may aid you in."\r\n\r\nVarney was silent for several moments; he seemed perceptibly moved by\r\nthe manner of the young man, as well as by the matter of his discourse.\r\nIn fact, one would suppose that Charles Holland had succeeded in\r\ninvesting what he said with some sort of charm that won much upon the\r\nfancy of Sir Francis Varney, for when he ceased to speak, the latter\r\nsaid in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on; you have surely much more to say."\r\n\r\n"No, Varney; I have said enough, and not thus much would I have said had\r\nI not been aware, most certainly and truly aware, without the shadow of\r\na doubt, by your manner, that you were most accessible to human\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\n"I accessible to human feeling! know you to whom you speak? Am I not he\r\nbefore whom all men shudder, whose name has been a terror and a\r\ndesolation; and yet you can talk of my human feelings. Nay, if I had had\r\nany, be sure they would have been extinguished by the persecutions I\r\nhave endured from those who, you know, with savage ferocity have sought\r\nmy life."\r\n\r\n"No, Varney; I give you credit for being a subtler reasoner than thus to\r\nargue; you know well that you were the aggressor to those parties who\r\nsought your life; you know well that with the greatest imaginable pains\r\nyou held yourself up to them as a thing of great terror."\r\n\r\n"I did--I did."\r\n\r\n"You cannot, then, turn round upon ignorant persons, and blame them\r\nbecause your exertions to make yourself seem what you wish were but too\r\nsuccessful."\r\n\r\n"You use the word _seem_," said Varney, with a bitterness of aspect, "as\r\nif you would imply a doubt that I am that which thousands, by their\r\nfears, would testify me to be."\r\n\r\n"Thousands might," said Charles Holland; "but not among them am I,\r\nVarney; I will not be made the victim of superstition. Were you to enact\r\nbefore my very eyes some of those feats which, to the senses of others,\r\nwould stamp you as the preternatural being you assume to be, I would\r\ndoubt the evidence of my own senses ere I permitted such a bugbear to\r\noppress my brain."\r\n\r\n"Go," said Sir Francis Varney, "go: I have no more words for you; I have\r\nnothing to relate to you."\r\n\r\n"Nay, you have already listened sufficiently to me to give me a hope\r\nthat I had awakened some of the humanity that was in your nature. Do\r\nnot, Sir Francis Varney, crush that hope, even as it was budding forth;\r\nnot for my own sake do I ask you for revelations; that may,\r\nperhaps--must be painful for you; but for the sake of Flora Bannerworth,\r\nto whom you owe abundance of reparation."\r\n\r\n"No, no."\r\n\r\n"In the name of all that is great, and good, and just, I call upon you\r\nfor justice."\r\n\r\n"What have I to do with such an invocation? Utter such a sentiment to\r\nmen who, like yourself, are invested with the reality as well as the\r\noutward show of human nature."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Sir Francis Varney, now you belie yourself. You have passed\r\nthrough a long, and, perchance, a stormy life. Can you look back upon\r\nyour career, and find no reminiscences of the past that shall convince\r\nyou that you are of the great family of man, and have had abundance of\r\nhuman feelings and of human affections?"\r\n\r\n"Peace, peace!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Sir Francis Varney, I will take your word, and if you will lay\r\nyour hand upon your heart, and tell me truly that you never felt what it\r\nwas to love--to have all feeling, all taste, and all hope of future joy,\r\nconcentrated in one individual, I will despair, and leave you. If you\r\nwill tell me that never, in your whole life, you have felt for any fair\r\nand glorious creature, as I now feel for Flora Bannerworth, a being for\r\nwhom you could have sacrificed not only existence, but all the hopes of\r\na glorious future that bloom around it--if you will tell me, with the\r\ncalm, dispassionate aspect of truth, that you have held yourself aloof\r\nfrom such human feelings, I will no longer press you to a disclosure\r\nwhich I shall bring no argument to urge."\r\n\r\nThe agitation of Sir Francis Varney\'s countenance was perceptible, and\r\nCharles Holland was about to speak again, when, striking him upon the\r\nbreast with his clinched hand, the vampyre checked him, saying--\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to drive me mad, that you thus, from memory\'s hidden cells,\r\nconjure up images of the past?"\r\n\r\n"Then there are such images to conjure up--there are such shadows only\r\nsleeping, but which require only, as you did even now, but a touch to\r\nawaken them to life and energy. Oh, Sir Francis Varney, do not tell me\r\nthat you are not human."\r\n\r\nThe vampyre made a furious gesture, as if he would have attacked Charles\r\nHolland; but then he sank nearly to the floor, as if soul-stricken by\r\nsome recollection that unnerved his arm; he shook with unwonted emotion,\r\nand, from the frightful livid aspect of his countenance, Charles dreaded\r\nsome serious accession of indisposition, which might, if nothing else\r\ndid, prevent him from making the revelation he so much sought to hear\r\nfrom his lips.\r\n\r\n"Varney," he cried, "Varney, be calm! you will be listened to by one who\r\nwill draw no harsh--no hasty conclusions; by one, who, with that\r\ncharity, I grieve to say, is rare, will place upon the words you utter\r\nthe most favourable construction. Tell me all, I pray you, tell me all."\r\n\r\n"This is strange," said the vampyre. "I never thought that aught human\r\ncould thus have moved me. Young man, you have touched the chords of\r\nmemory; they vibrate throughout my heart, producing cadences and sounds\r\nof years long past. Bear with me awhile."\r\n\r\n"And you will speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\n"Having your promise, then, I am content, Varney."\r\n\r\n"But you must be secret; not even in the wildest waste of nature, where\r\nyou can well presume that naught but Heaven can listen to your\r\nwhisperings, must you utter one word of that which I shall tell to you."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Charles, "I dare not take such a confidence; I have said\r\nthat it is not for myself; I seek such knowledge of what you are, and\r\nwhat you have been, but it is for another so dear to me, that all the\r\ncharms of life that make up other men\'s delights, equal not the witchery\r\nof one glance from her, speaking as it does of the glorious light from\r\nthat Heaven which is eternal, from whence she sprung."\r\n\r\n"And you reject my communication," said Varney, "because I will not give\r\nyou leave to expose it to Flora Bannerworth?"\r\n\r\n"It must be so."\r\n\r\n"And you are most anxious to hear that which I have to relate?"\r\n\r\n"Most anxious, indeed--indeed, most anxious."\r\n\r\n"Then have I found in that scruple which besets your mind, a better\r\nargument for trusting you, than had ye been loud in protestation. Had\r\nyour promises of secrecy been but those which come from the lip, and not\r\nfrom the heart, my confidence would not have been rejected on such\r\ngrounds. I think that I dare trust you."\r\n\r\n"With leave to tell to Flora that which you shall communicate."\r\n\r\n"You may whisper it to her, but to no one else, without my special leave\r\nand licence."\r\n\r\n"I agree to those terms, and will religiously preserve them."\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt you for one moment; and now I will tell to you what\r\nnever yet has passed my lips to mortal man. Now will I connect together\r\nsome matters which you may have heard piecemeal from others."\r\n\r\n"What others are they?"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Chillingworth, and he who once officiated as a London hangman."\r\n\r\n"I have heard something from those quarters."\r\n\r\n"Listen then to me, and you shall better understand that which you have\r\nheard. Some years ago, it matters not the number, on a stormy night,\r\ntowards the autumn of the year, two men sat alone in poverty, and that\r\nspecies of distress which beset the haughty, profligate, daring man, who\r\nhas been accustomed all his life to its most enticing enjoyments, but\r\nnever to that industry which alone ought to produce them, and render\r\nthem great and magnificent."\r\n\r\n"Two men; and who were they?"\r\n\r\n"I was one. Look upon me! I was of those men; and strong and evil\r\npassions were battling in my heart."\r\n\r\n"And the other!"\r\n\r\n"Was Marmaduke Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven! the father of her whom I adore; the suicide."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the same; that man stained with a thousand vices--blasted by a\r\nthousand crimes--the father of her who partakes nothing of his nature,\r\nwho borrows nothing from his memory but his name--was the man who there\r\nsat with me, plotting and contriving how, by fraud or violence, we were\r\nto lead our usual life of revelry and wild audacious debauch."\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on; believe me, I am deeply interested."\r\n\r\n"I can see as much. We were not nice in the various schemes which our\r\nprolific fancies engendered. If trickery, and the false dice at the\r\ngaming-table, sufficed not to fill our purses, we were bold enough for\r\nviolence. If simple robbery would not succeed, we could take a life."\r\n\r\n"Murder?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, call it by its proper name, a murder. We sat till the midnight hour\r\nhad passed, without arriving at a definite conclusion; we saw no plan of\r\npracticable operation, and so we wandered onwards to one of those deep\r\ndens of iniquity, a gaming-house, wherein we had won and lost thousands.\r\n\r\n"We had no money, but we staked largely, in the shape of a wager, upon\r\nthe success of one of the players; we knew not, or cared not, for the\r\nconsequence, if we had lost; but, as it happened, we were largely\r\nsuccessful, and beggars as we had walked into that place, we might have\r\nleft it independent men.\r\n\r\n"But when does the gambler know when to pause in his career? If defeat\r\nawakens all the raging passions of humanity within his bosom, success\r\nbut feeds the great vice that has been there engendered. To the dawn of\r\nmorn we played; the bright sun shone in, and yet we played--the midday\r\ncame, and went--the stimulant of wine supported us, and still we played;\r\nthen came the shadows of evening, stealing on in all their beauty. But\r\nwhat were they to us, amid those mutations of fortune, which, at one\r\nmoment, made us princes, and placed palaces at our control, and, at\r\nanother, debased us below the veriest beggar, that craves the stinted\r\nalms of charity from door to door.\r\n\r\n"And there was one man who, from the first to the last, stayed by us\r\nlike a very fiend; more than man, I thought he was not human. We won of\r\nall, but of him. People came and brought their bright red gold, and laid\r\nit down before us, but for us to take it up, and then, by a cruel stroke\r\nof fortune, he took it from us.\r\n\r\n"The night came on; we won, and he won of us; the clock struck\r\ntwelve--we were beggars. God knows what was he.\r\n\r\n"We saw him place his winnings about his person--we saw the smile that\r\ncurved the corners of his lips; he was calm, and we were maddened. The\r\nblood flowed temperately through his veins, but in ours it was burning\r\nlava, scorching as it went through every petty artery, and drying up all\r\nhuman thought--all human feeling.\r\n\r\n"The winner left, and we tracked his footsteps. When he reached the open\r\nair, although he had taken much less than we of the intoxicating\r\nbeverages that are supplied gratis to those who frequent those haunts of\r\ninfamy, it was evident that some sort of inebriation attacked him; his\r\nsteps were disordered and unsteady, and, as we followed him, we could\r\nperceive, by the devious track that he took, that he was somewhat\r\nuncertain of his route.\r\n\r\n"We had no fixed motive in so pursuing this man. It was but an impulsive\r\nproceeding at the best; but as he still went on and cleared the streets,\r\ngetting into the wild and open country, and among the hedge-rows, we\r\nbegan to whisper together, and to think that what we did not owe to\r\nfortune, we might to our own energy and courage at such a moment.\r\n\r\n"I need not hesitate to say so, since, to hide the most important\r\nfeature of my revelation from you, would be but to mock you; we resolved\r\nupon robbing him.\r\n\r\n"And was that all?"\r\n\r\n"It was all that our resolution went to. We were not anxious to spill\r\nblood; but still we were resolved that we would accomplish our purpose,\r\neven if it required murder for its consummation. Have you heard enough?"\r\n\r\n"I have not heard enough, although I guess the rest."\r\n\r\n"You may well guess it, from its preface. He turned down a lonely\r\npathway, which, had we chosen it ourselves, could not have been more\r\nsuitable for the attack we meditated.\r\n\r\n"There were tall trees on either side, and a hedge-row stretching high\r\nup between them. We knew that that lane led to a suburban village,\r\nwhich, without a doubt, was the object of his destination.\r\n\r\n"Then Marmaduke Bannerworth spoke, saying,--\r\n\r\n"\'What we have to do, must be done now or never. There needs not two in\r\nthis adventure. Shall you or I require him to refund what he has won\r\nfrom us?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I care not,\' I said; \'but if we are to accomplish our purpose without\r\narousing even a shadow of resistance, it is better to show him its\r\nfutility by both appearing, and take a share in the adventure.\'\r\n\r\n"This was agreed upon, and we hastened forward. He heard footsteps\r\npursuing him and quickened his pace. I was the fleetest runner, and\r\novertook him. I passed him a pace or two, and then turning, I faced him,\r\nand impeded his progress.\r\n\r\n"The lane was narrow, and a glance behind him showed him Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth; so that he was hemmed in between two enemies, and could\r\nmove neither to the right nor to the left, on account of the thick\r\nbrushwood that intervened between the trees.\r\n\r\n"Then, with an assumed courage, that sat but ill upon him, he demanded\r\nof us what we wanted, and proclaimed his right to pass despite the\r\nobstruction we placed in his way.\r\n\r\n"The dialogue was brief. I, being foremost, spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"\'Your money,\' I said; \'your winnings at the gaming-table. We cannot,\r\nand we will not lose it.\'\r\n\r\n"So suddenly, that he had nearly taken my life, he drew a pistol from\r\nhis pocket, and levelling it at my head, he fired upon me.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, had I moved, it might have been my death; but, as it was, the\r\nbullet furrowed my cheek, leaving a scar, the path of which is yet\r\nvisible in a white cicatrix.\r\n\r\n"I felt a stunning sensation, and thought myself a dead man. I cried\r\naloud to Marmaduke Bannerworth, and he rushed forward. I knew not that\r\nhe was armed, and that he had the power about him to do the deed which\r\nhe then accomplished; but there was a groan, a slight struggle, and the\r\nsuccessful gamester fell upon the green sward, bathed in his blood."\r\n\r\n"And this is the father of her whom I adore?"\r\n\r\n"It is. Are you shocked to think of such a neat relationship between so\r\nmuch beauty and intelligence and a midnight murderer? Is your philosophy\r\nso poor, that the daughter\'s beauty suffers from the commission of a\r\nfather\'s crime?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, It is not so. Do not fancy that, for one moment, I can\r\nentertain such unworthy opinions. The thought that crossed me was that I\r\nshould have to tell one of such a gentle nature that her father had done\r\nsuch a deed."\r\n\r\n"On that head you can use your own discretion. The deed was done; there\r\nwas sufficient light for us to look upon the features of the dying man.\r\nGhastly and terrific they glared upon us; while the glazed eyes, as they\r\nwere upturned to the bright sky, seemed appealing to Heaven for\r\nvengeance against us, for having done the deed.\r\n\r\n"Many a day and many an hour since at all times and all seasons, I have\r\nseen those eyes, with the glaze of death upon them, following me, and\r\ngloating over the misery they had the power to make. I think I see them\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; look--look--see how they glare upon me--with what a fixed and\r\nfrightful stare the bloodshot pupils keep their place--there, there! oh!\r\nsave me from such a visitation again. It is too horrible. I dare not--I\r\ncannot endure it; and yet why do you gaze at me with such an aspect,\r\ndread visitant? You know that it was not my hand that did the deed--who\r\nlaid you low. You know that not to me are you able to lay the heavy\r\ncharge of your death!"\r\n\r\n"Varney, you look upon vacancy," said Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"No, no; vacancy it may be to you, but to me \'tis full of horrible\r\nshapes."\r\n\r\n"Compose yourself; you have taken me far into your confidence already; I\r\npray you now to tell me all. I have in my brain no room for horrible\r\nconjectures such as those which might else torment me."\r\n\r\nVarney was silent for a few minutes, and then he wiped from his brow the\r\nheavy drops of perspiration that had there gathered, and heaved a deep\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n"Speak to me," added Charles; "nothing will so much relieve you from the\r\nterrors of this remembrance as making a confidence which reflection will\r\napprove of, and which you will know that you have no reason to repent."\r\n\r\n"Charles Holland," said Varney, "I have already gone too far to\r\nretract--much too far, I know, and can well understand all the danger of\r\nhalf confidence. You already know so much, that it is fit you should\r\nknow more."\r\n\r\n"Go on then, Varney, I will listen to you."\r\n\r\n"I know not if, at this juncture, I can command myself to say more. I\r\nfeel that what next has to be told will be most horrible for me to\r\ntell--most sad for you to hear told."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe, Varney, from your manner of speech, and from the\r\nwords you use, that you have some secret to relate beyond this simple\r\nfact of the murder of this gamester by Marmaduke Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"You are right--such is the fact; the death of that man could not have\r\nmoved me as you now see me moved. There is a secret connected with his\r\nfate which I may well hesitate to utter--a secret even to whisper to the\r\nwinds of heaven--I--although I did not do the deed, no, no--I--I did not\r\nstrike the blow--not I--not I!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Varney, it is astonishing to me the pains you take to assure yourself\r\nof your innocence of this deed; no one accuses you, but still, were it\r\nnot that I am impressed with a strong conviction that you\'re speaking to\r\nme nothing but the truth, the very fact of your extreme anxiety to\r\nacquit yourself, would engender suspicion."\r\n\r\n"I can understand that feeling, Charles Holland; I can fully understand\r\nit. I do not blame you for it--it is a most natural one; but when you\r\nknow all, you will feel with me how necessary it must have been to my\r\npeace to seize upon every trivial circumstance that can help me to a\r\nbelief in my own innocence."\r\n\r\n"It may be so; as yet, you well know, I speak in ignorance. But what\r\ncould there have been in the character of that gambler, that has made\r\nyou so sympathetic concerning his decease?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--nothing whatever in his character. He was a bad man; not one\r\nof those free, open spirits which are seduced into crime by\r\nthoughtlessness--not one of those whom we pity, perchance, more than we\r\ncondemn; but a man without a redeeming trait in his disposition--a man\r\nso heaped up with vices and iniquities, that society gained much by his\r\ndecease, and not an individual could say that he had lost a friend."\r\n\r\n"And yet the mere thought of the circumstances connected with his death\r\nseems almost to drive you to the verge of despair."\r\n\r\n"You are right; the mere thought has that effect."\r\n\r\n"You have aroused all my curiosity to know the causes of such a\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\nVarney paced the apartment in silence for many minutes. He seemed to be\r\nenduring a great mental struggle, and at length, when he turned to\r\nCharles Holland and spoke, there were upon his countenance traces of\r\ndeep emotion.\r\n\r\n"I have said, young man, that I will take you into my confidence. I have\r\nsaid that I will clear up many seeming mysteries, and that I will enable\r\nyou to understand what was obscure in the narrative of Dr.\r\nChillingworth, and of that man who filled the office of public\r\nexecutioner, and who has haunted me so long."\r\n\r\n"It is true, then, as the doctor states, that you were executed in\r\nLondon?"\r\n\r\n"I was."\r\n\r\n"And resuscitated by the galvanic process, put into operation by Dr.\r\nChillingworth?"\r\n\r\n"As he supposed; but there are truths connected with natural philosophy\r\nwhich he dreamed not of. I bear a charmed life, and it was but accident\r\nwhich produced a similar effect upon the latent springs of my existence\r\nin the house to which the executioner conducted me, to what would have\r\nbeen produced had I been sufficed, in the free and open air, to wait\r\nuntil the cool moonbeams fell upon me."\r\n\r\n"Varney, Varney," said Charles Holland, "you will not succeed in\r\nconvincing me of your supernatural powers. I hold such feelings and\r\nsensations at arm\'s length. I will not--I cannot assume you to be what\r\nyou affect."\r\n\r\n"I ask for no man\'s belief. I know that which I know, and, gathering\r\nexperience from the coincidences of different phenomena, I am compelled\r\nto arrive at certain conclusions. Believe what you please, doubt what\r\nyou please; but I say again that I am not as other men."\r\n\r\n"I am in no condition to depute your proposition; I wish not to dispute\r\nit; but you are wandering, Varney, from the point. I wait anxiously for\r\na continuation of your narrative."\r\n\r\n"I know that I am wandering from it--I know well that I am wandering\r\nfrom it, and that the reason I do so is that I dread that continuation."\r\n\r\n"That dread will nor be the less for its postponement."\r\n\r\n"You are right; but tell me, Charles Holland, although you are young you\r\nhave been about in the great world sufficiently to form correct\r\nopinions, and to understand that which is related to you, drawing proper\r\ndeductions from certain facts, and arriving possibly at more correct\r\nconclusions than some of maturer years with less wisdom."\r\n\r\n"I will freely answer, Varney, any question you may put to me."\r\n\r\n"I know it; tell me then what measure of guilt you attach to me in the\r\ntransaction I have noticed to you."\r\n\r\n"It seems then to me that, not contemplating the man\'s murder, you\r\ncannot be accused of the act, although a set of fortuitous circumstances\r\nmade you appear an accomplice to its commission."\r\n\r\n"You think I may be acquitted?"\r\n\r\n"You can acquit yourself, knowing that you did not contemplate the\r\nmurder."\r\n\r\n"I did not contemplate it. I know not what desperate deed I should have\r\nstopped short at then, in the height of my distress, but I neither\r\ncontemplated taking that man\'s life, nor did I strike the blow which\r\nsent him from existence."\r\n\r\n"There is even some excuse as regards the higher crime for Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Think you so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he thought that you were killed, and impulsively he might have\r\nstruck the blow that made him a murderer."\r\n\r\n"Be it so. I am willing, extremely willing that anything should occur\r\nthat should remove the odium of guilt from any man. Be it so, I say,\r\nwith all my heart; but now, Charles Holland, I feel that we must meet\r\nagain ere I can tell you all; but in the meantime let Flora Bannerworth\r\nrest in peace--she need dread nothing from me. Avarice and revenge, the\r\ntwo passions which found a home in my heart, are now stifled for ever."\r\n\r\n"Revenge! did you say revenge?"\r\n\r\n"I did; whence the marvel, am I not sufficiently human for that?"\r\n\r\n"But you coupled it with the name of Flora Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"I did, and that is part of my mystery."\r\n\r\n"A mystery, indeed, to imagine that such a being as Flora could awaken\r\nany such feeling in your heart--a most abundant mystery."\r\n\r\n"It is so. I do not affect to deny it: but yet it is true, although so\r\ngreatly mysterious, but tell her that although at one time I looked upon\r\nher as one whom I cared not if I injured, her beauty and distress\r\nchanged the current of my thoughts, and won upon me greatly, From the\r\nmoment I found I had the power to become the bane of her existence, I\r\nceased to wish to be so, and never again shall she experience a pang of\r\nalarm from Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Your message shall be faithfully delivered, and doubt not that it will\r\nbe received with grateful feelings. Nevertheless I should have much\r\nwished to have been in a position to inform her of more particulars."\r\n\r\n"Come to me here at midnight to-morrow, and you shall know all. I will\r\nhave no reservation with you, no concealments; you shall know whom I\r\nhave had to battle against, and how it is that a world of evil passions\r\ntook possession of my heart and made me what I am."\r\n\r\n"Are you firm in this determination, Varney--will you indeed tell me no\r\nmore to-night?"\r\n\r\n"No more, I have said it. Leave me now. I have need of more repose, for\r\nof late sleep has seldom closed my eyelids."\r\n\r\nCharles Holland was convinced, from the positive manner in which he\r\nspoke, that nothing more in the shape of information, at that time, was\r\nto be expected from Varney; and being fearful that if he urged this\r\nstrange being too far, at a time when he did not wish it, he might\r\nrefuse all further communication, he thought it prudent to leave him, so\r\nhe said to him,--\r\n\r\n"Be assured, Varney, I shall keep the appointment you have made, with an\r\nexpectation when we do meet of being rewarded by a recital of some full\r\nparticulars."\r\n\r\n"You shall not be disappointed; farewell, farewell!"\r\n\r\nCharles Holland bade him adieu, and left the place.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had now acquired all the information he hoped to take away\r\nwith him when Varney first began to be communicative, yet, when he came\r\nto consider how strange and unaccountable a being he had been in\r\ncommunication with, Charles could not but congratulate himself that he\r\nhad heard so much, for, from the manner of Varney, he could well suppose\r\nthat that was, indeed, the first time he had been so communicative upon\r\nsubjects which evidently held so conspicuous a place in his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd he had abundance of hope, likewise, from what had been said by\r\nVarney, that he would keep his word, and communicate to him fully all\r\nelse that he required to know; and when he recollected those words which\r\nVarney had used, signifying that he knew the danger of half confidences,\r\nthat hope grew into a certainty, and Charles began to have no doubt but\r\nthat on the next evening all that was mysterious in the various affairs\r\nconnected with the vampyre would become clear and open to the light of\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHe strolled down the lane in which the lone house was situated,\r\nrevolving these matters in his mind, and when he arrived at its\r\nentrance, he was rather surprised to see a throng of persons hastily\r\nmoving onward, with come appearance of dismay about them, and anxiety\r\ndepicted upon their countenances.\r\n\r\nHe stopped a lad, and inquired of him the cause of the seeming tumult.\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, the fact is," said the boy, "a crowd from the town\'s been\r\nburning down Bannerworth Hall, and they\'ve killed a man."\r\n\r\n"Bannerworth Hall! you must be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I ought not to call it Bannerworth Hall, because I mean the\r\nold ruins in the neighbourhood that are supposed to have been originally\r\nBannerworth Hall before the house now called such was built; and,\r\nmoreover, as the Bannerworths have always had a garden there, and two or\r\nthree old sheds, the people in the town called it Bannerworth Hall in\r\ncommon with the other building."\r\n\r\n"I understand. And do you say that all have been destroyed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. All that was capable of being burnt has been burnt, and, what\r\nis more, a man has been killed among the ruins. We don\'t know who he is,\r\nbut the folks said he was a vampyre, and they left him for dead."\r\n\r\n"When will these terrible outrages cease? Oh! Varney, Varney, you have\r\nmuch to answer for; even if in your conscience you succeed in acquitting\r\nyourself of the murder, some of the particulars concerning which you\r\nhave informed me of."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS ARRIVAL AT THE INN.--THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN.--THE LETTER\r\nTO VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhile these affairs are proceeding, and when there seems every\r\nappearance of Sir Francis Varney himself quickly putting an end to some\r\nof the vexatious circumstances connected with himself and the\r\nBannerworth family, it is necessary that we should notice an occurrence\r\nwhich took place at the same inn which the admiral had made such a scene\r\nof confusion upon the occasion of his first arrival in the town.\r\n\r\nNot since the admiral had arrived with Jack Pringle, and so disturbed\r\nthe whole economy of the household, was there so much curiosity excited\r\nas on the morning following the interview which Charles Holland had had\r\nwith Varney, the vampyre.\r\n\r\nThe inn was scarcely opened, when a stranger arrived, mounted on a\r\ncoal-black horse, and, alighting, he surrendered the bridle into the\r\nhands of a boy who happened to be at the inn-door, and stalked slowly\r\nand solemnly into the building.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, and of a cadaverous aspect; in attire he was plainly\r\napparelled, but there was no appearance of poverty about him; on the\r\ncontrary, what he really had on was of a rich and costly character,\r\nalthough destitute of ornament.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in the first room that presented itself, and awaited the\r\nappearance of the landlord, who, upon being informed that a guest of\r\napparently ample means, and of some consequence, had entered the place,\r\nhastily went to him to receive his commands.\r\n\r\nWith a profusion of bows, our old friend, who had been so obsequious to\r\nAdmiral Bell, entered the room, and begged to know what orders the\r\ngentleman had for him.\r\n\r\n"I presume," said the stranger, in a deep, solemn voice, "I presume that\r\nyou have no objection, for a few days that I shall remain in this town,\r\nto board and lodge me for a certain price which you can name to me at\r\nonce?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir," said the landlord; "any way you please; without wine,\r\nsir, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"As you please; make your own arrangements."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, as we can\'t tell, of course, what wine a gentleman may\r\ndrink, but when we come to consider breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper,\r\nand a bed, and all that sort of thing, and a private sitting-room, I\r\nsuppose, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"You would not, then, think, sir, a matter of four guineas a week will\r\nbe too much, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I told you to name your own charge. Let it be four guineas; if you had\r\nsaid eight I should have paid it."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said the publican, "here\'s a damned fool that I am. I beg\r\nyour pardon, sir, I didn\'t mean you. Now I could punch my own head--will\r\nyou have breakfast at once, sir, and then we shall begin regular, you\r\nknow, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Have what?"\r\n\r\n"Breakfast, breakfast, you know, sir; tea, coffee, cocoa, or chocolate;\r\nham, eggs, or a bit of grilled fowl, cold sirloin of roast beef, or a\r\nred herring--anything you like, sir."\r\n\r\n"I never take breakfast, so you may spare yourself the trouble of\r\nproviding anything for me."\r\n\r\n"Not take breakfast, sir! not take breakfast! Would you like to take\r\nanything to drink then, sir? People say it\'s an odd time, at eight\r\no\'clock in the morning, to drink; but, for my part, I always have\r\nthought that you couldn\'t begin a good thing too soon."\r\n\r\n"I live upon drink," said the stranger; "but you have none in the cellar\r\nthat will suit me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I am certain."\r\n\r\n"Why, we\'ve got some claret now, sir," said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"Which may look like blood, and yet not be it."\r\n\r\n"Like what, sir?--damn my rags!"\r\n\r\n"Begone, begone."\r\n\r\nThe stranger uttered these words so peremptorily that the landlord\r\nhastily left the room, and going into his own bar, he gave himself so\r\nsmall a tap on the side of the head, that it would not have hurt a fly,\r\nas he said,--\r\n\r\n"I could punch myself into bits, I could tear my hair out by the roots;"\r\nand then he pulled a little bit of his hair, so gently and tenderly that\r\nit showed what a man of discretion he was, even in the worst of all his\r\nagony of passion.\r\n\r\n"The idea," he added, "of a fellow coming here, paying four guineas a\r\nweek for board and lodging, telling me he would not have minded eight,\r\nand then not wanting any breakfast; it\'s enough to aggravate half a\r\ndozen saints; but what an odd fish he looks."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the ostler came in, and, standing at the bar, he wiped\r\nhis mouth with his sleeve, as he said,--\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll stand a quart for that, master?"\r\n\r\n"A quart for what, you vagabond? A quart because I\'ve done myself up in\r\nheaps; a quart because I\'m fit to pull myself into fiddlestrings?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the ostler; "because I\'ve just put up the gentleman\'s horse."\r\n\r\n"What gentleman\'s horse?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the big-looking fellow with the white face, now in the parlour."\r\n\r\n"What, did he come on a horse, Sam? What sort of a looking creature is\r\nit? you may judge of a man from the sort of horse-company he keeps."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, sir, I hardly know. It\'s coal black, and looks as knowing\r\nas possible; it\'s tried twice to get a kick at me, but I was down upon\r\nhim, and put the bucket in his way. Howsomdever, I don\'t think it\'s a\r\nbad animal, as a animal, mind you, sir, though a little bit wicious or\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the publican, as he drew the ostler half a pint instead of\r\na quart, "you\'re always drinking; take that."\r\n\r\n"Blow me," said the ostler, "half a pint, master!"\r\n\r\n"Plague take you, I can\'t stand parleying with you, there\'s the parlour\r\nbell; perhaps, after all, he will have some breakfast."\r\n\r\nWhile the landlord was away the ostler helped himself to a quart of the\r\nstrongest ale, which, by a singular faculty that he had acquired, he\r\npoured down his throat without any effort at swallowing, holding his\r\nhead back, and the jug at a little distance from his mouth.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished this feat, he reversed the jug, giving it a knowing\r\ntap with his knuckles as though he would have signified to all the world\r\nthat it was empty, and that he had accomplished what he desired.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the landlord had made his way to his strange guest, who\r\nsaid to him, when he came into the room,\r\n\r\n"Is there not one Sir Francis Varney residing in this town?"\r\n\r\n"The devil!" thought the landlord; "this is another of them, I\'ll bet a\r\nguinea. Sir Francis Varney, sir, did you say? Why, sir, there was a Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, but folks seem to think as how he\'s no better than he\r\nshould be--a sort of vampyre, sir, if you know what that is."\r\n\r\n"I have, certainly, heard of such things; but can you not tell me\r\nVarney\'s address? I wish to see him."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, sir, I cannot tell it to you, for there\'s really been such\r\na commotion and such a riot about him that he\'s taken himself off, I\r\nthink, altogether, and we can hear nothing of him. Lord bless you, sir,\r\nthey burnt down his house, and hunted him about so, that I don\'t think\r\nthat he\'ll ever show his face here again."\r\n\r\n"And cannot you tell me where he was seen last?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot, sir; but, if anybody knows anything about him, it\'s Mr.\r\nHenry Bannerworth, or perhaps Dr. Chillingworth, for they have had more\r\nto do with him than anybody else."\r\n\r\n"Indeed; and can you tell me the address of the former individual?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t, sir, for the Bannerworths have left the Hall. As for the\r\ndoctor, sir, you\'ll see his house in the High-street, with a large brass\r\nplate on the door, so that you cannot mistake it. It\'s No. 9, on the\r\nother side of the way."\r\n\r\n"I thank you for so much information," said the stranger, and rising, he\r\nwalked to the door. Before, however, he left, he turned, and\r\nadded,--"You can say, if you should by chance meet Mr. Bannerworth, that\r\na Hungarian nobleman wishes to speak to him concerning Sir Francis\r\nVarney, the vampyre?"\r\n\r\n"A what, sir?"\r\n\r\n"A nobleman from Hungary," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" said the landlord, as he looked after him. "He don\'t seem\r\nat all hungry here, not thirsty neither. What does he mean by a nobleman\r\nfrom Hungary? The idea of a man talking about hungry, and not taking any\r\nbreakfast. He\'s queering me. I\'ll be hanged if I\'ll stand it. Here I\r\nclearly lose four guineas a week, and then get made game of besides. A\r\nnobleman, indeed! I think I see him. Why, he isn\'t quite so big as old\r\nSlaney, the butcher. It\'s a do. I\'ll have at him when he comes back."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the unconscious object of this soliloquy passed down the\r\nHigh-street, until he came to Dr. Chillingworth\'s, at whose door he\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Chillingworth had been waiting the whole night for the return\r\nof the doctor, who had not yet made his appearance, and, consequently,\r\nthat lady\'s temper had become acidulated to an uncommon extent and when\r\nshe heard a knock at the door, something possessed her that it could be\r\nno other than her spouse, and she prepared to give him that warm\r\nreception which she considered he had a right, as a married man, to\r\nexpect after such conduct.\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly filled a tolerably sized hand-basin with not the cleanest\r\nwater in the world, and then, opening the door hurriedly with one hand,\r\nshe slouced the contents into the face of the intruder, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve caught it!"\r\n\r\n"D--n!" said the Hungarian nobleman, and then Mrs. Chillingworth uttered\r\na scream, for she feared she had made a mistake.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! I\'m very sorry: but I thought it was my husband."\r\n\r\n"But if you did," said the stranger, "there was no occasion to drown him\r\nwith a basin of soap-suds. It is your husband I want, madam, if he be\r\nDr. Chillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Then, indeed, you must go on wanting him, sir, for he\'s not been to his\r\nown home for a day and a night. He takes up all his time in hunting\r\nafter that beastly vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Sir Francis Varney, you mean."\r\n\r\n"I do; and I\'d Varney him if I caught hold of him."\r\n\r\n"Can you give me the least idea of where he can be found?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I can."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! where?" said the stranger, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"In some churchyard, to be sure, gobbling up the dead bodies."\r\n\r\nWith this Mrs. Chillingworth shut the door with a bang that nearly\r\nflattened the Hungarian\'s nose with his face, and he was fain to walk\r\naway, quite convinced that there was no information to be had in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the inn, and having told the landlord that he would give\r\na handsome reward to any one who would discover to him the retreat of\r\nSir Francis Varney, he shut himself up in an apartment alone, and was\r\nbusy for a time in writing letters.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sum which the stranger offered was an indefinite one, the\r\nlandlord mentioned the matter across the bar to several persons; but all\r\nof them shook their heads, believing it to be a very perilous adventure\r\nindeed to have anything to do with so troublesome a subject as Sir\r\nFrancis Varney. As the day advanced, however, a young lad presented\r\nhimself, and asked to see the gentleman who had been inquiring for\r\nVarney.\r\n\r\nThe landlord severely questioned and cross-questioned him, with the hope\r\nof discovering if he had any information: but the boy was quite\r\nobdurate, and would speak to no one but the person who had offered the\r\nreward, so that mine host was compelled to introduce him to the\r\nHungarian nobleman, who, as yet, had neither eaten nor drunk in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe boy wore upon his countenance the very expression of juvenile\r\ncunning, and when the stranger asked him if he really was in possession\r\nof any information concerning the retreat of Sir Francis Varney, he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"I can tell you where he is, but what are you going to give?"\r\n\r\n"What sum do you require?" said the stranger.\r\n\r\n"A whole half-crown."\r\n\r\n"It is your\'s; and, if your information prove correct, come to-morrow,\r\nand I\'ll add another to it, always provided, likewise, you keep the\r\nsecret from any one else."\r\n\r\n"Trust me for that," said the boy. "I live with my grandmother; she\'s\r\nprecious old, and has got a cottage. We sell milk and cakes, sticky\r\nstuff, and pennywinkles."\r\n\r\n"A goodly collection. Go on."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, this morning, there comes a man in with a bottle, and he\r\nbuys a bottle full of milk and a loaf. I saw him, and I knew it was\r\nVarney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"You followed him?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I did, sir; and he\'s staying at the house that\'s to let down\r\nthe lane, round the corner, by Mr. Biggs\'s, and past Lee\'s garden,\r\nleaving old Slaney\'s stacks on your right hand, and so cutting on till\r\nyou come to Grants\'s meadow, when you\'ll see old Madhunter a brick-field\r\nstaring of you in the face; and, arter that--"\r\n\r\n"Peace--peace!--you shall yourself conduct me. Come to this place at\r\nsunset; be secret, and, probably, ten times the reward you have already\r\nreceived may be yours," said the stranger.\r\n\r\n"What, ten half-crowns?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will keep my word with you."\r\n\r\n"What a go! I know what I\'ll do. I\'ll set up as a show man, and what a\r\nglorious treat it will be, to peep through one of the holes all day\r\nmyself, and get somebody to pull the strings up and down, and when I\'m\r\ntired of that, I can blaze away upon the trumpet like one o\'clock. I\r\nthink I see me. Here you sees the Duke of Marlborough a whopping of\r\neverybody, and here you see the Frenchmen flying about like parched peas\r\nin a sifter."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCITED POPULACE.--VARNEY HUNTED.--THE PLACE OF REFUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere seemed, now a complete lull in the proceedings as connected with\r\nVarney, the vampyre. We have reason to believe that the executioner who\r\nhad been as solicitous as Varney to obtain undisputed possession of\r\nBannerworth Hall, has fallen a victim to the indiscriminating rage of\r\nthe mob. Varney himself is a fugitive, and bound by the most solemn ties\r\nto Charles Holland, not only to communicate to him such particulars of\r\nthe past, as will bring satisfaction to his mind, but to abstain from\r\nany act which, for the future, shall exercise a disastrous influence\r\nupon the happiness of Flora.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the admiral, with Henry, had betaken themselves from the\r\nHall as we had recorded, and, in due time, reached the cottage where\r\nFlora and her mother had found a temporary refuge.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bannerworth was up; but Flora was sleeping, and, although the\r\ntidings they had to tell were of a curious and mixed nature, they would\r\nnot have her disturbed to listen to them.\r\n\r\nAnd, likewise, they were rather pleased than otherwise, since they knew\r\nnot exactly what had become of Charles Holland, to think that they would\r\nprobably be spared the necessity of saying they could not account for\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nThat he had gone upon some expedition, probably dangerous, and so one\r\nwhich he did not wish to communicate the particulars of to his friends,\r\nlest they should make a strong attempt to dissuade him from it, they\r\nwere induced to believe.\r\n\r\nBut yet they had that confidence in his courage and active intellectual\r\nresources, to believe that he would come through it unscathed, and,\r\nprobably, shortly show himself at the cottage.\r\n\r\nIn this hope they were not disappointed, for in about two hours Charles\r\nmade his appearance; but, until he began to be questioned concerning his\r\nabsence by the admiral, he scarcely considered the kind of dilemma he\r\nhad put himself into by the promise of secrecy he had given to Varney,\r\nand was a little puzzled to think how much he might tell, and how much\r\nhe was bound in honour to conceal.\r\n\r\n"Avast there!" cried the admiral; "what\'s become of your tongue,\r\nCharles? You\'ve been on some cruize, I\'ll be bound. Haul over the ship\'s\r\nbooks, and tell us what\'s happened."\r\n\r\n"I have been upon an adventure," said Charles, "which I hope will be\r\nproductive of beneficial results to us all; but, the fact is, I have\r\nmade a promise, perhaps incautiously, that I will not communicate what I\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Whew!" said the admiral, "that\'s awkward; but, however, if a man said\r\nunder sealed instructions, there\'s an end of it. I remember when I was\r\noff Candia once---"\r\n\r\n"Ha!" interposed Jack, "that was the time you tumbled over the blessed\r\nbinnacle, all in consequence of taking too much Madeira. I remember it,\r\ntoo--it\'s an out and out good story, that \'ere. You took a rope\'s end,\r\nyou know, and laid into the bowsprit; and, says you, \'Get up, you\r\nlubber,\' says you, all the while a thinking, I supposes, as it was long\r\nJack Ingram, the carpenter\'s mate, laying asleep. What a lark!"\r\n\r\n"This scoundrel will be the death of me," said the admiral; "there isn\'t\r\none word of truth in what he says. I never got drunk in all my life, as\r\neverybody knows. Jack, affairs are getting serious between you and I--we\r\nmust part, and for good. It\'s a good many times that I\'ve told you\r\nyou\'ve forgot the difference between the quarter-deck and the caboose.\r\nNow, I\'m serious--you\'re off the ship\'s books, and there\'s an end of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Jack; "I\'m willing I\'ll leave you. Do you think I want\r\nto keep you any longer? Good bye, old bloak--I\'ll leave you to repent,\r\nand when old grim death comes yard-arm and yard-arm with you, and you\r\ncan\'t shake off his boarding-tackle, you\'ll say, \'Where\'s Jack Pringle?\'\r\nsays you; and then what\'s his mane--oh ah! echo you call it--echo\'ll\r\nsay, it\'s d----d if it knows."\r\n\r\nJack turned upon his heel, and, before the admiral could make any reply\r\nhe left the place.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the rascal up to now?" said the admiral. "I really didn\'t think\r\nhe\'d have taken me at my word."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, after all, you didn\'t mean it, uncle?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you, you lubber, whether I mean it, or not, you\r\nshore-going squab? Of course I expect everybody to desert an old hulk,\r\nrats and all--and now Jack Pringle\'s gone; the vagabond, couldn\'t he\r\nstay, and get drunk as long as he liked! Didn\'t he say what he pleased,\r\nand do what he pleased, the mutinous thief? Didn\'t he say I run away\r\nfrom a Frenchman off Cape Ushant, and didn\'t I put up with that?"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear uncle, you sent him away yourself."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t, and you know I didn\'t; but I see how it is, you\'ve disgusted\r\nJack among you. A better seaman never trod the deck of a man-of-war."\r\n\r\n"But his drunkenness, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie. I don\'t believe he ever got drunk. I believe you all\r\ninvented it, and Jack\'s so good-natured, he tumbled about just to keep\r\nyou in countenance."\r\n\r\n"But his insolence, uncle; his gross insolence towards you--his\r\ninventions, his exaggerations of the truth?"\r\n\r\n"Avast, there--avast, there--none of that, Master Charlie; Jack couldn\'t\r\ndo anything of the sort; and I means to say this, that if Jack was here\r\nnow, I\'d stick up for him, and say he was a good seaman.\r\n\r\n"Tip us your fin, then," said Jack, darting into the room; "do you think\r\nI\'d leave you, you d----d old fool? What would become of you, I wonder,\r\nif I wasn\'t to take you in to dry nurse? Why, you blessed old babby,\r\nwhat do you mean by it?"\r\n\r\n"Jack, you villain!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! go on and call me a villain as much as you like. Don\'t you remember\r\nwhen the bullets were scuttling our nobs?"\r\n\r\n"I do, I do, Jack; tip us your fin, old fellow. You\'ve saved my life\r\nmore than once."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t. You did, I say."\r\n\r\n"You bed----d!"\r\n\r\nAnd thus was the most serious misunderstanding that these two worthies\r\never had together made up. The real fact is, that the admiral could as\r\nlittle do without Jack, as he could have done without food; and as for\r\nPringle, he no more thought of leaving the old commodore, than of--what\r\nshall we say? forswearing him. Jack himself could not have taken a\r\nstronger oath.\r\n\r\nBut the old admiral had suffered so much from the idea that Jack had\r\nactually left him, that although he abused him as usual often enough, he\r\nnever again talked of taking him off the ship\'s books; and, to the\r\ncredit of Jack be it spoken, he took no advantage of the circumstance,\r\nand only got drunk just as usual, and called his master an old fool\r\nwhenever it suited him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN GETS INTO DANGER.--HE IS FIRED AT, AND SHOWS SOME\r\nOF HIS QUALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nConsiderably delighted was the Hungarian, not only at the news he had\r\nreceived from the boy, but as well for the cheapness of it. Probably he\r\ndid not conceive it possible that the secret of the retreat of such a\r\nman as Varney could have been attained so easily.\r\n\r\nHe waited with great impatience for the evening, and stirred not from\r\nthe inn for several hours; neither did he take any refreshment,\r\nnotwithstanding he had made so liberal an arrangement with the landlord\r\nto be supplied.\r\n\r\nAll this was a matter of great excitement and speculation in the inn, so\r\nmuch so, indeed, that the landlord sent for some of the oldest customers\r\nof his house, regular topers, who sat there every evening, indulging in\r\nstrong drinks, and pipes and tobacco, to ask their serious advice as to\r\nwhat he should do, as if it were necessary he should do anything at all.\r\n\r\nBut, somehow or another, these wiseacres who assembled at the landlord\'s\r\nbidding, and sat down, with something strong before them, in the bar\r\nparlour, never once seemed to think that a man might, if he choosed,\r\ncome to an inn, and agree to pay four guineas a week for board and\r\nlodging, and yet take nothing at all.\r\n\r\nNo; they could not understand it, and therefore they would not have it.\r\nIt was quite monstrous that anybody should attempt to do anything so\r\ncompletely out of the ordinary course of proceeding. It was not to be\r\nborne; and as in this country it happens, free and enlightened as we\r\nare, that no man can commit a greater social offence than doing\r\nsomething that his neighbours never thought of doing themselves, the\r\nHungarian nobleman was voted a most dangerous character, and, in fact,\r\nnot to be put up with.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have thought so much of it" said the landlord; "but only\r\nlook at the aggravation of the thing. After I have asked him four\r\nguineas a week, and expected to be beaten down to two, to be then told\r\nthat he would not have cared if it had been eight. It is enough to\r\naggravate a saint."\r\n\r\n"Well, I agree with you there," said another; "that\'s just what it is,\r\nand I only wonder that a man of your sagacity has not quite understood\r\nit before."\r\n\r\n"Understood what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that he is a vampyre. He has heard of Sir Francis Varney, that\'s\r\nthe fact, and he\'s come to see him. Birds of a feather, you know, flock\r\ntogether, and now we shall have two vampyres in the town instead of\r\none."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe party looked rather blank at this suggestion, which, indeed, seemed\r\nrather uncomfortable probably. The landlord had just opened his mouth to\r\nmake some remark, when he was stopped by the violent ringing of what he\r\nnow called the vampyre\'s bell, since it proceeded from the room where\r\nthe Hungarian nobleman was.\r\n\r\n"Have you an almanack in the house?" was the question of the mysterious\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n"An almanack, sir? well, I really don\'t know. Let me see, an almanack."\r\n\r\n"But, perhaps, you can tell me. I was to know the moon\'s age."\r\n\r\n"The devil!" thought the landlord; "he\'s a vampyre, and no mistake. Why,\r\nsir, as to the moon\'s age, it was a full moon last night, very bright\r\nand beautiful, only you could not see it for the clouds."\r\n\r\n"A full moon last night," said the mysterious guest, thoughtfully; "it\r\nmay shine, then, brightly, to-night, and if so, all will be well. I\r\nthank you,--leave the room."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say, sir, you don\'t want anything to eat now?"\r\n\r\n"What I want I\'ll order."\r\n\r\n"But you have ordered nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then presume that I want nothing."\r\n\r\nThe discomfited landlord was obliged to leave the room, for there was no\r\nsuch a thing as making any answer to this, and so, still further\r\nconfirmed in his opinion that the stranger was a vampyre that came to\r\nsee Sir Francis Varney from a sympathetic feeling towards him, he again\r\nreached the bar-parlour.\r\n\r\n"You may depend," he said, "as sure as eggs is eggs, that he is a\r\nvampyre. Hilloa! he\'s going off,--after him--after him; he thinks we\r\nsuspect him. There he goes--down the High-street."\r\n\r\nThe landlord ran out, and so did those who were with him, one of whom\r\ncarried his brandy and water in his hand, which, being too hot for him\r\nto swallow all at once, he still could not think of leaving behind.\r\n\r\nIt was now gelling rapidly dark, and the mysterious stranger was\r\nactually proceeding towards the lane to keep his appointment with the\r\nboy who had promised to conduct him to the hiding-place of Sir Francis\r\nVarney.\r\n\r\nHe had not proceeded far, however, before he began to suspect that he\r\nwas followed, as it was evident on the instant that he altered his\r\ncourse; for, instead of walking down the lane, where the boy was waiting\r\nfor him, he went right on, and seemed desirous of making his way into\r\nthe open country between the town and Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\nHis pursuers--for they assumed that character--when they saw this became\r\nanxious to intercept him; and thinking that the greater force they had\r\nthe better, they called out aloud as they passed a smithy, where a man\r\nwas shoeing a horse,--\r\n\r\n"Jack Burdon, here is another vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"The deuce there is!" said the person who was addressed. "I\'ll soon\r\nsettle him. Here\'s my wife gets no sleep of a night as it is, all owing\r\nto that Varney, who has been plaguing us so long. I won\'t put up with\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he snatched from a hook on which it hung, an old\r\nfowling-piece, and joined the pursuit, which now required to be\r\nconducted with some celerity, for the stranger had struck into the open\r\ncountry, and was getting on at good speed.\r\n\r\nThe last remnants of the twilight were fading away, and although the\r\nmoon had actually risen, its rays were obscured by a number of light,\r\nfleecy clouds, which, although they did not promise to be of long\r\ncontinuance, as yet certainly impeded the light.\r\n\r\n"Where is he going?" said the blacksmith. "He seems to be making his way\r\ntowards the mill-stream."\r\n\r\n"No," said another; "don\'t you see he is striking higher up towards the\r\nold ford, where the stepping-stones are!"\r\n\r\n"He is--he is," cried the blacksmith. "Run on--run on; don\'t you see he\r\nis crossing it now? Tell me, all of you, are you quite sure he is a\r\nvampyre, and no mistake? He ain\'t the exciseman, landlord, now, is he?"\r\n\r\n"The exciseman, the devil! Do you think I want to shoot the exciseman?"\r\n\r\n"Very good--then here goes," exclaimed the Smith.\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and just as the brisk night air blew aside the clouds from\r\nbefore the face of the moon, and as the stranger was crossing the\r\nslippery stones, he fired at him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow silently and sweetly the moon\'s rays fall upon the water, upon the\r\nmeadows, and upon the woods. The scenery appeared the work of\r\nenchantment, some fairy land, waiting the appearance of its inhabitants.\r\nNo sound met the ear; the very wind was hushed; nothing was there to\r\ndistract the sense of sight, save the power of reflection.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, would aid the effect of such a scene. A cloudless sky, the\r\nstars all radiant with beauty, while the moon, rising higher and higher\r\nin the heavens, increasing in the strength and refulgence of her light,\r\nand dimming the very stars, which seemed to grow gradually invisible as\r\nthe majesty of the queen of night became more and more manifest.\r\n\r\nThe dark woods and the open meadows contrasted more and more strongly;\r\nlike light and shade, the earth and sky were not more distinct and\r\napart; and the ripling stream, that rushed along with all the\r\nimpetuosity of uneven ground.\r\n\r\nThe banks are clothed with verdure; the tall sedges, here and there,\r\nlined the sides; beds of bulrushes raised their heads high above all\r\nelse, and threw out their round clumps of blossoms like tufts, and\r\nlooked strange in the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nHere and there, too, the willows bent gracefully over the stream, and\r\ntheir long leaves were wafted and borne up and down by the gentler force\r\nof the stream.\r\n\r\nBelow, the stream widened, and ran foaming over a hard, stony bottom,\r\nand near the middle is a heap of stones--of large stones, that form the\r\nbed of the river, from which the water has washed away all earthy\r\nparticles, and left them by themselves.\r\n\r\nThese stones in winter could not be seen, they were all under water, and\r\nthe stream washed over in a turbulent and tumultuous manner. But now,\r\nwhen the water was clear and low, they are many of them positively out\r\nof the water, the stream running around and through their interstices;\r\nthe water-weeds here and there lying at the top of the stream, and\r\nblossoming beautifully.\r\n\r\nThe daisy-like blossoms danced and waved gently on the moving flood, at\r\nthe same time they shone in the moonlight, like fairy faces rising from\r\nthe depths of the river, to receive the principle of life from the\r\nmoon\'s rays.\r\n\r\n\'Tis sweet to wander in the moonlight at such an hour, and it is sweet\r\nto look upon such a scene with an unruffled mind, and to give way to the\r\nfeelings that are engendered by a walk by the river side.\r\n\r\nSee, the moon is rising higher and higher, the shadows grow shorter and\r\nshorter; the river, which in places was altogether hidden by the tall\r\nwillow trees, now gradually becomes less and less hidden, and the water\r\nbecomes more and more lit up.\r\n\r\nThe moonbeams play gracefully on the rippling surface, here and there\r\nappearing like liquid silver, that each instant changed its position and\r\nsurface exposed to the light.\r\n\r\nSuch a moment--such a scene, were by far too well calculated to cause\r\nthe most solemn and serious emotions of the mind, and he must have been\r\nbut at best insensible, who could wander over meadow and through grove,\r\nand yet remain untouched by the scene of poetry and romance in which he\r\nbreathed and moved.\r\n\r\nAt such a time, and in such a place, the world is alive with all the\r\nfiner essences of mysterious life. \'Tis at such an hour that the spirits\r\nquit their secret abodes, and visit the earth, and whirl round the\r\nenchanted trees.\r\n\r\n\'Tis now the spirits of earth and air dance their giddy flight from\r\nflower to flower. \'Tis now they collect and exchange their greetings;\r\nthe wood is filled with them, the meadows teem with them, the hedges at\r\nthe river side have them hidden among the deep green leaves and blades.\r\n\r\nBut what is that yonder, on the stones, partially out of the water--what\r\ncan it be? The more it is looked at, the more it resembles the human\r\nform--and yet it is still and motionless on the hard stones--and yet it\r\nis a human form. The legs are lying in the water, the arms appear to be\r\npartially in and partially out, they seem moved by the stream now and\r\nthen, but very gently--so slightly, indeed, that it might well be\r\nquestioned if it moved at all.\r\n\r\nThe moon\'s rays had not yet reached it; the bank on the opposite side of\r\nthe stream was high, and some tall trees rose up and obscured the moon.\r\nBut she was rising higher and higher each moment, and, finally, when it\r\nhas reached the tops of those trees, then the rays will reach the middle\r\nof the river, and then, by degrees, it will reach the stones in the\r\nriver, and, finally, the body that lies there so still and so\r\nmysteriously.\r\n\r\nHow it came there it would be difficult to say. It appeared as though,\r\nwhen the waters were high, the body had floated down, and, at the\r\nsubsidence of the waters, it had been left upon the stones, and now it\r\nwas exposed to view.\r\n\r\nIt was strange and mysterious, and those who might look upon such a\r\nsight would feel their blood chill, and their body creep, to contemplate\r\nthe remains of humanity in such a place, and in such a condition as that\r\nmust be in.\r\n\r\nA human life had been taken! How? Who could tell? Perhaps accident alone\r\nwas the cause of it; perhaps some one had taken a life by violent means,\r\nand thrown the body in the waters to conceal the fact and the crime.\r\n\r\nThe waters had brought it down, and deposited it there in the middle of\r\nthe river, without any human creature being acquainted with the fact.\r\n\r\nBut the moon rises--the beams come trembling through the tree tops and\r\nstraggling branches, and fall upon the opposite bank, and there lies the\r\nbody, mid stream, and in comparative darkness.\r\n\r\nBy the time the river is lit up by the moon\'s rays, then the object on\r\nthe stones will be visible, then it can be ascertained what appears now\r\nonly probable, namely, is the dark object a human form or not?\r\n\r\nIn the absence of light it appears to be so, but when the flood of\r\nsilver light falls upon it, it would be placed then beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe time is approaching--the moon each moment approaches her meridian,\r\nand each moment do the rays increase in number and in strength, while\r\nthe shadows shorten.\r\n\r\nThe opposite bank each moment becomes more and more distinct, and the\r\nside of the stream, the green rushes and sedges, all by degrees come\r\nfull into view.\r\n\r\nNow and then a fish leaps out of the stream, and just exhibits itself,\r\nas much as to say, "There are things living in the stream, and I am one\r\nof them."\r\n\r\nThe moment is one of awe--the presence of that mysterious and\r\ndreadful-looking object, even while its identity remains doubt, chills\r\nthe heart--it contracts the expanding thoughts to that one object--all\r\ninterest in the scene lies centered in that one point.\r\n\r\nWhat could it be? What else but a human body? What else could assume\r\nsuch a form? But see, nearly half the stream is lit by the moonbeams\r\nstruggling through the tree tops, and now rising above them. The light\r\nincreases, and the shadows shorten.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the bed of stones now becomes lit up by the moonlight; the\r\nrippling stream, the bubbles, and the tiny spray that was caused by the\r\nrush of water against the stones, seemed like sparkling flashes of\r\nsilver fire.\r\n\r\nThen came the moonbeams upon the body, for it was raised above the level\r\nof the water, and shewed conspicuously; for the moonbeams reached the\r\nbody before they fell on the surrounding water; for that reason then it\r\nwas the body presented a strange and ghastly object against a deep, dark\r\nbackground, by which it was surrounded.\r\n\r\nBut this did not last long--the water in another minute was lit up by\r\nthe moon\'s pale beams, and then indeed could be plainly enough seen the\r\nbody of a man lying on the heap of stones motionless and ghastly.\r\n\r\nThe colourless hue of the moonlight gave the object a most horrific and\r\nterrible appearance! The face of the dead man was turned towards the\r\nmoon\'s rays, and the body seemed to receive all the light that could\r\nfall upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible object to look upon, and one that added a new and\r\nsingular interest to the scene! The world seemed then to be composed\r\nalmost exclusively of still life, and the body was no impediment to the\r\nstillness of the scene.\r\n\r\nIt was, all else considered, a calm, beautiful scene, lovely the night,\r\ngorgeous the silvery rays that lit up the face of nature; the hill and\r\ndale, meadow, and wood, and river, all afforded contrasts strong,\r\nstriking, and strange.\r\n\r\nBut strange, and more strange than any contrast in nature, was that\r\nafforded to the calm beauty of the night and place by the deep stillness\r\nand quietude imposed upon the mind by that motionless human body.\r\n\r\nThe moon\'s rays now fell upon its full length; the feet were lying in\r\nthe water, the head lay back, with its features turned towards the\r\nquarter of the heavens where the moon shone from; the hair floated on\r\nthe shallow water, while the face and body were exposed to all\r\ninfluences, from its raised and prominent position.\r\n\r\nThe moonbeams had scarcely settled upon it--scarce a few minutes--when\r\nthe body moved. Was it the water that moved it? it could not be, surely,\r\nthat the moonbeams had the power of recalling life into that inanimate\r\nmass, that lay there for some time still and motionless as the very\r\nstones on which it lay.\r\n\r\nIt was endued with life; the dead man gradually rose up, and leaned\r\nhimself upon his elbow; he paused a moment like one newly recalled to\r\nlife; he seemed to become assured he did live. He passed one hand\r\nthrough his hair, which was wet, and then rose higher into a sitting\r\nposture, and then he leaned on one hand, inclining himself towards the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nHis breast heaved with life, and a kind of deep inspiration, or groan,\r\ncame from him, as he first awoke to life, and then he seemed to pause\r\nfor a few moments. He turned gradually over, till his head inclined down\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nJust below, the water deepened, and ran swiftly and silently on amid\r\nmeads and groves of trees. The vampyre was revived; he awoke again to a\r\nghastly life; he turned from the heap of stones, he gradually allowed\r\nhimself to sink into deep water, and then, with a loud plunge, he swam\r\nto the centre of the river.\r\n\r\nSlowly and surely did he swim into the centre of the river, and down the\r\nstream he went. He took long, but easy strokes, for he was going down\r\nthe stream, and that aided him.\r\n\r\nFor some distance might he be heard and seen through the openings in the\r\ntrees, but he became gradually more and more indistinct, till sound and\r\nsight both ceased, and the vampyre had disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of this singular scene, not one word had passed\r\nbetween the landlord and his companions. When the blacksmith fired the\r\nfowling-piece, and saw the stranger fall, apparently lifeless, upon the\r\nstepping-stones that crossed the river, he became terrified at what he\r\nhad done, and gazed upon the seeming lifeless form with a face on which\r\nthe utmost horror was depicted.\r\n\r\nThey all seemed transfixed to the spot, and although each would have\r\ngiven worlds to move away, a kind of nightmare seemed to possess them,\r\nwhich stunned all their faculties, and brought over them a torpidity\r\nfrom which they found it impossible to arouse themselves.\r\n\r\nBut, when the apparently dead man moved again, and when, finally, the\r\nbody, which appeared so destitute of life, rolled into the stream, and\r\nfloated away with the tide, their fright might be considered to have\r\nreached its climax. The absence of the body, however, had seemingly, at\r\nall events, the effect of releasing them from the mental and physical\r\nthraldom in which they were, and they were enabled to move from the\r\nspot, which they did immediately, making their way towards the town with\r\ngreat speed.\r\n\r\nAs they got near, they held a sort of council of war as to what they\r\nshould do under the circumstances, the result of which was, that they\r\ncame to a conclusion to keep all that they had done and seen to\r\nthemselves; for, if they did not, they might be called upon for some\r\nvery troublesome explanations concerning the fate of the supposed\r\nHungarian nobleman whom they had taken upon themselves to believe was a\r\nvampyre, and to shoot accordingly, without taking the trouble to inquire\r\ninto the legality of such an act.\r\n\r\nHow such a secret was likely to be kept, when it was shared amongst\r\nseven people, it is hard to say; but, if it were so kept, it could only\r\nbe under the pressure of a strong feeling of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nThey were forced individually, of course, to account for their absence\r\nduring the night at their respective homes, and how they managed to do\r\nthat is best known to themselves.\r\n\r\nAs to the landlord, he felt compelled to state that, having his\r\nsuspicions of his guest aroused, he followed him on a walk that he\r\npretended to take, and he had gone so far, that at length he had given\r\nup the chase, and lost his own way in returning.\r\n\r\nThus was it, then, that this affair still preserved all its mystery,\r\nwith a large superadded amount of fear attendant upon it; for, if the\r\nmysterious guest were really anything supernatural, might he not come\r\nagain in a much more fearful shape, and avenge the treatment he had\r\nreceived?\r\n\r\nThe only person who fell any disappointment in the affair, or whose\r\nexpectations were not realised, was the boy who had made the appointment\r\nwith the supposed vampyre at the end of the lane, and who was to have\r\nreceived what he considered so large a reward for pointing out the\r\nretreat of Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\nHe waited in vain for the arrival of the Hungarian nobleman, and, at\r\nlast, indignation got the better of him, and he walked away. Feeling\r\nthat he had been jilted, he resolved to proceed to the public-house and\r\ndemand the half-crowns which had been so liberally promised him; but\r\nwhen he reached there he found that the party whom he sought was not\r\nwithin, nor the landlord either, for that was the precise time when that\r\nworthy individual was pursuing his guest over meadow and bill, through\r\nbrake and through briar, towards the stepping stones on the river.\r\n\r\nWhat the boy further did on the following day, when he found that he was\r\nto reap no more benefit for the adventure, we shall soon perceive.\r\n\r\nAs for the landlord, he did endeavour to catch a few hours\' brief\r\nrepose; but as he dreamed that the Hungarian nobleman came in the\r\nlikeness of a great toad, and sat upon his chest, feeling like the\r\nweight of a mountain, while he, the landlord, tried to scream and cry\r\nfor help, but found that he could neither do one thing nor the other, we\r\nmay guess that his repose did not at all invigorate him.\r\n\r\nAs he himself expressed it, he got up all of a shake, with a strong\r\nimpression that he was a very ill-used individual, indeed, to have had\r\nthe nightmare in the day time.\r\n\r\nAnd now we will return to the cottage where the Bannerworth family were\r\nat all events, making themselves quite as happy as they did at their\r\nancient mansion, in order to see what is there passing, and how Dr.\r\nChillingworth made an effort to get up some evidence of something that\r\nthe Bannerworth family knew nothing of, therefore could not very well be\r\nexpected to render him much assistance. That he did, however, make what\r\nhe considered an important discovery, we shall perceive in the course of\r\nthe ensuing chapter, in which it will be seen that the best hidden\r\nthings will, by the merest accident, sometimes come to light, and that,\r\ntoo, when least expected by any one at all connected with the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE POCKET BOOK OF MARMADUKE BANNERWORTH.--ITS\r\nMYSTERIOUS CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe little episode had just taken place which we have recorded between\r\nthe old admiral and Jack Pringle, when Henry Bannerworth and Charles\r\nHolland stepped aside to converse.\r\n\r\n"Charles," said Henry, "it has become absolutely necessary that I should\r\nput an end to this state of dependence in which we all live upon your\r\nuncle. It is too bad to think, that because, through fighting the\r\nbattles of his country, he has amassed some money, we are to eat it up."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Charles, "does it not strike you, that it would\r\nbe a great deal worse than too bad, if my uncle could not do what he\r\nliked with his own?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but, Charles, that is not the question."\r\n\r\n"I think it is, though I know not what other question you can make of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"We have all talked it over, my mother, my brother, and Flora; and my\r\nbrother and I have determined, if this state of things should last much\r\nlonger, to find out some means of honourable exertion by which we may,\r\nat all events, maintain ourselves without being burdensome to any."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we will talk of that another time."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but hear me; we were thinking that if we went into some branch of\r\nthe public service, your uncle would have the pleasure, such we are\r\nquite sure it would be to him, of assisting us greatly by his name and\r\ninfluence."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Henry, that\'s all very well; but for a little time do not\r\nthrow up the old man and make him unhappy. I believe I am his only\r\nrelative in the world, and, as he has often said, he intended leaving me\r\nheir to all he possesses, you see there is no harm done by you receiving\r\na small portion of it beforehand."\r\n\r\n"And," said Henry, "by that line of argument, we are to find an excuse\r\nfor robbing your uncle; in the fact, that we are robbing you likewise."\r\n\r\n"No, no; indeed, you do not view the matter rightly."\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is, Charles, that while I feel, and while we all\r\nfeel, the deepest debt of gratitude towards your uncle, it is our duty\r\nto do something. In a box which we have brought with us from the Hall,\r\nand which has not been opened since our father\'s death, I have stumbled\r\nover some articles of ancient jewellery and plate, which, at all events,\r\nwill produce something."\r\n\r\n"But which you must not part with."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but, Charles, these are things I knew not we possessed, and most\r\nill-suited do they happen to be to our fallen fortunes. It is money we\r\nwant, not the gewgaws of a former state, to which we can have now no\r\nsort of pretension."\r\n\r\n"Nay, I know you have all the argument; but still is there something sad\r\nand uncomfortable to one\'s feelings in parting with such things as those\r\nwhich have been in families for many years."\r\n\r\n"But we knew not that we had them; remember that, Charles. Come and look\r\nat them. Those relics of a bygone age may amuse you, and, as regards\r\nmyself, there are no circumstances whatever associated with them that\r\ngive them any extrinsic value; so laugh at them or admire them, as you\r\nplease, I shall most likely be able to join with you in either feeling."\r\n\r\n"Well, be it so--I will come and look at them; but you must think better\r\nof what you say concerning my uncle, for I happen to know--which you\r\nought likewise by this time--how seriously the old man would feel any\r\nrejection on your part of the good he fancies he is doing you. I tell\r\nyou, Henry, it is completely his hobby, and let him have earned his\r\nmoney with ten times the danger he has, he could not spend it with\r\nanything like the satisfaction that he does, unless he were allowed to\r\ndispose of it in this way."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; be it so for a time."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, his attachment to Flora is so great--which is a most\r\nfortunate circumstance for me--that I should not be at all surprised\r\nthat she cuts me out of one half my estate, when the old man dies. But\r\ncome, we will look at your ancient bijouterie."\r\n\r\nHenry led Charles into an apartment of the cottage where some of the few\r\nthings had been placed that were brought from Bannerworth Hall, which\r\nwere not likely to be in constant and daily use.\r\n\r\nAmong these things happened to be the box which Henry had mentioned, and\r\nfrom which he had taken a miscellaneous assortment of things of an\r\nantique and singular character.\r\n\r\nThere were old dresses of a season and of a taste long gone by; ancient\r\narticles of defence; some curiously wrought daggers; and a few\r\nornaments, pretty, but valueless, along with others of more sterling\r\npretensions, which Henry pointed out to Charles.\r\n\r\n"I am almost inclined to think," said the latter, "that some of these\r\nthings are really of considerable value; but I do not I profess to be an\r\naccurate judge, and, perhaps, I am more taken with the beauty of an\r\narticle, than the intrinsic worth. What is that which you have just\r\ntaken from the box?"\r\n\r\n"It seems a half-mask," said Henry, "made of silk; and here are initial\r\nletters within it--M. B."\r\n\r\n"To what do they apply?"\r\n\r\n"Marmaduke Bannerworth, my father."\r\n\r\n"I regret I asked you."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Charles, you need not. Years have now elapsed since that misguided\r\nman put a period to his own existence, in the gardens of Bannerworth\r\nHall. Of course, the shock was a great one to us all, although I must\r\nconfess that we none of us knew much of a father\'s affections. But time\r\nreconciles one to these dispensations, and to a friend, like yourself, I\r\ncan talk upon these subjects without a pang."\r\n\r\nHe laid down the mask, and proceeded further in his search in the old\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nTowards the bottom of it there were some books, and, crushed in by the\r\nside of them, there was an ancient-looking pocket-book, which Charles\r\npointed out, saying,--\r\n\r\n"There, Henry, who knows but you may find a fortune when you least\r\nexpect it?"\r\n\r\n"Those who expect nothing," said Henry, "will not be disappointed. At\r\nall events, as regards this pocket-book, you see it is empty."\r\n\r\n"Not quite. A card has fallen from it."\r\n\r\nCharles took up the card, and read upon it the name of Count Barrare.\r\n\r\n"That name," he said, "seems familiar to me. Ah! now I recollect, I have\r\nread of such a man. He flourished some twenty, or five-and-twenty years\r\nago, and was considered a _roue_ of the first water--a finished\r\ngamester; and, in a sort of brief memoir I read once of him, it said\r\nthat he disappeared suddenly one day, and was never again heard of."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I\'m not puzzled to think how his card came into my father\'s\r\npocket-book. They met at some gaming-house; and, if some old pocket-book\r\nof the Count Barrare\'s were shaken, there might fall from it a card,\r\nwith the name of Mr. Marmaduke Bannerworth upon it."\r\n\r\n"Is there nothing further in the pocket-book--no memoranda?"\r\n\r\n"I will look. Stay! here is something upon one of the leaves--let me\r\nsee--\'Mem., twenty-five thousand pounds! He who robs the robber, steals\r\nlittle; it was not meant to kill him: but it will be unsafe to use the\r\nmoney for a time--my brain seems on fire--the remotest hiding-place in\r\nthe house is behind the picture."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of that?" said Charles.\r\n\r\n"I know not what to think. There is one thing though, that I do know."\r\n\r\n"And what is that?"\r\n\r\n"It is my father\'s handwriting. I have many scraps of his, and his\r\npeculiar hand is familiar to me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very strange, then, what it can refer to."\r\n\r\n"Charles--Charles! there is a mystery connected with our fortunes, that\r\nI never could unravel; and once or twice it seemed as if we were upon\r\nthe point of discovering all; but something has ever interfered to\r\nprevent us, and we have been thrown back into the realms of conjecture.\r\nMy father\'s last words were, \'The money is hidden;\' and then he tried to\r\nadd something; but death stopped his utterance. Now, does it not almost\r\nseem that this memorandum alluded to the circumstance?"\r\n\r\n"It does, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And then, scarcely had my father breathed his last, when a man comes\r\nand asks for him at the garden-gate, and, upon hearing that he is dead,\r\nutters some imprecations, and walks away."\r\n\r\n"Well, Henry, you must trust to time and circumstances to unravel these\r\nmysteries. For myself, I own that I cannot do so; I see no earthly way\r\nout of the difficulty whatever. But still it does appear to me as if Dr.\r\nChillingworth knew something or had heard something, with which he\r\nreally ought to make you acquainted."\r\n\r\n"Do not blame the worthy doctor; he may have made an error of judgment,\r\nbut never one of feeling; and you may depend, if he is keeping anything\r\nfrom me, that he is doing so from some excellent motive: most probably\r\nbecause he thinks it will give me pain, and so will not let me endure\r\nany unhappiness from it, unless he is quite certain as regards the\r\nfacts. When he is so, you may depend he will be communicative, and I\r\nshall know all that he has to relate. But, Charles, it is evident to me\r\nthat you, too, are keeping something."\r\n\r\n"I!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you acknowledge to having had an interview, and a friendly one,\r\nwith Varney; and you likewise acknowledge that he had told you things\r\nwhich he has compelled you to keep secret."\r\n\r\n"I have promised to keep them secret, and I deeply regret the promise\r\nthat I have made. There cannot be anything to my mind more essentially\r\ndisagreeable than to have one\'s tongue tied in one\'s interview with\r\nfriends. I hate to hear anything that I may not repeat to those whom I\r\ntake into my own confidence."\r\n\r\n"I can understand the feeling; but here comes the worthy doctor."\r\n\r\n"Show him the memorandum."\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Chillingworth entered the apartments Henry handed him the\r\nmemorandum that had been found in the old pocket-book, saying as he did\r\nso,--\r\n\r\n"Look at that, doctor, and give us your candid opinion upon it."\r\n\r\nDr. Chillingworth fitted on his spectacles, and read the paper\r\ncarefully. At its conclusion, he screwed up his mouth into an extremely\r\nsmall compass, and doubling up the paper, he put it into his capacious\r\nwaistcoat pocket, saying as he did so,--\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! oh! oh! hum!"\r\n\r\n"Well, doctor," said Henry; "we are waiting for your opinion."\r\n\r\n"My opinion! Well, then, my dear boy, I must say, my opinion, to the\r\nbest of my belief is, that I really don\'t know anything about it."\r\n\r\n"Then, perhaps, you\'ll surrender us the memorandum," said Charles;\r\n"because, if you don\'t know anything, we may as well make a little\r\ninquiry."\r\n\r\n"Ha!" said the worthy doctor; "we can\'t put old heads upon young\r\nshoulders, that\'s quite clear. Now, my good young men, be patient and\r\nquiet; recollect, that what you know you\'re acquainted with, and that\r\nthat which is hidden from you, you cannot very well come to any very\r\ncorrect conclusion upon. There\'s a right side and a wrong one you may\r\ndepend, to every question; and he who walks heedlessly in the dark, is\r\nvery apt to run his head against a post. Good evening, my boys--good\r\nevening."\r\n\r\nAway bustled the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Charles, "what do you think of that, Mr. Henry?"\r\n\r\n"I think he knows what he\'s about."\r\n\r\n"That may be; but I\'ll be hanged if anybody else does. The doctor is by\r\nno means favourable to the march of popular information; and I really\r\nthink he might have given us some food for reflection, instead of\r\nleaving us so utterly and entirely at fault as he has; and you know he\'s\r\ntaken away your memorandum even."\r\n\r\n"Let him have it, Charles--let him have it; it is safe with him. The old\r\nman may be, and I believe is, a little whimsical and crotchety; but he\r\nmeans abundantly well, and he\'s just one of those sort of persons, and\r\nalways was, who will do good his own way, or not at all; so we must take\r\nthe good with the bad in those cases, and let Dr. Chillingworth do as he\r\npleases."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say it is nothing to me, although those words were rising to\r\nmy lips, because you know, Henry, that everything which concerns you or\r\nyours is something to me; and therefore it is that I feel extremely\r\nanxious for the solution of all this mystery. Before I hear the sequel\r\nof that which Varney, the vampyre, has so strongly made me a confidant\r\nof, I will, at all events, make an effort to procure his permission to\r\ncommunicate it to all those who are in any way beneficially interested\r\nin the circumstances. Should he refuse me that permission, I am almost\r\ninclined myself to beg him to withhold his confidence."\r\n\r\n"Nay, do not do so, Charles--do not do that, I implore you. Recollect,\r\nalthough you cannot make us joint recipients with you in your knowledge,\r\nyou can make use of it, probably, to our advantage, in saving us,\r\nperchance, from the different consequences, so that you can make what\r\nyou know in some way beneficial to us, although not in every way."\r\n\r\n"There is reason in that, and I give in at once. Be it so, Henry. I will\r\nwait on him, and if I cannot induce him to change his determination, and\r\nallow me to tell some other as well as Flora, I must give in, and take\r\nthe thing as a secret, although I shall not abandon a hope, even after\r\nhe has told me all he has to tell, that I may induce him to permit me to\r\nmake a general confidence, instead of the partial one he has empowered\r\nme to do."\r\n\r\n"It may be so; and, at all events, we must not reject a proffered good\r\nbecause it is not quite so complete as it might be."\r\n\r\n"You are right; I will keep my appointment with him, entertaining the\r\nmost sanguine hope that our troubles and disasters--I say our, because I\r\nconsider myself quite associated in thought, interest, and feelings with\r\nyour family--may soon be over."\r\n\r\n"Heaven grant it may be so, for your\'s and Flora\'s sake; but I feel that\r\nBannerworth Hall will never again be the place it was to us. I should\r\nprefer that we sought for new associations, which I have no doubt we may\r\nfind, and that among us we get up some other home that would be happier,\r\nbecause not associated with so many sad scenes in our history."\r\n\r\n"Be it so; and I am sure that the admiral would gladly give way to such\r\nan arrangement. He has often intimated that he thought Bannerworth Hall\r\na dull place; consequently, although he pretends to have purchased it of\r\nyou, I think he will be very glad to leave it."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Be it so, then. If it should really happen that we are upon the eve of\r\nany circumstances that will really tend to relieve us from our misery\r\nand embarrassments, we will seek for some pleasanter abode than the\r\nHall, which you may well imagine, since it became the scene of that\r\ndreadful tragedy that left us fatherless, has borne but a distasteful\r\nappearance to all our eyes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder at that, and am only surprised that, after such a thing\r\nhad happened any of you liked to inhabit the place."\r\n\r\n"We did not like, but our poverty forced us. You have no notion of the\r\ndifficulties through which we have struggled; and the fact that we had a\r\nhome rent free was one of so much importance to us, that had it been\r\nsurrounded by a thousand more disagreeables than it was, we must have\r\nput up with it; but now that we owe so much to the generosity of your\r\nuncle, I suppose we can afford to talk of what we like and of what we\r\ndon\'t like."\r\n\r\n"You can, Henry, and it shall not be my fault if you do not always\r\nafford to do so; and now, as the time is drawing on, I think I will\r\nproceed at once to Varney, for it is better to be soon than late, and\r\nget from him the remainder of his story."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were active influences at work, to prevent Sir Francis Varney from\r\nso quickly as he had arranged to do, carrying out his intention of\r\nmaking Charles Holland acquainted with the history of the eventful\r\nperiod of his life, which had been associated with Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth.\r\n\r\nOne would have scarcely thought it possible that anything now would have\r\nprevented Varney from concluding his strange narrative; but that he was\r\nprevented, will appear.\r\n\r\nThe boy who had been promised such liberal payment by the Hungarian\r\nnobleman, for betraying the place of Varney\'s concealment, we have\r\nalready stated, felt bitterly the disappointment of not being met,\r\naccording to promise, at the corner of the lane, by that individual.\r\n\r\nIt not only deprived him of the half-crowns, which already in\r\nimagination he had laid out, but it was a great blow to his own\r\nimportance, for after his discovery of the residence of the vampyre, he\r\nlooked upon himself as quite a public character, and expected great\r\napplause for his cleverness.\r\n\r\nBut when the Hungarian nobleman came not, all these dreams began to\r\nvanish into thin air, and, like the unsubstantial fabric of a vision, to\r\nleave no trace behind them.\r\n\r\nHe got dreadfully aggravated, and his first thought was to go to Varney,\r\nand see what he could get from him, by betraying the fact that some one\r\nwas actively in search of him.\r\n\r\nThat seemed, however, a doubtful good, and perhaps there was some\r\npersonal dread of the vampyre mixed up with the rejection of this\r\nproposition. But reject it he did, and then he walked moodily into the\r\ntown without any fixed resolution of what he should do.\r\n\r\nAll that he thought of was a general idea that he should like to create\r\nsome mischief, if possible--what it was he cared not, so long as it made\r\na disturbance.\r\n\r\nNow, he knew well that the most troublesome and fidgetty man in the town\r\nwas Tobias Philpots, a saddler, who was always full of everybody\'s\r\nbusiness but his own, and ever ready to hear any scandal of his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n"I have a good mind," said the boy, "to go to old Philpots, and tell him\r\nall about it, that I have."\r\n\r\nThe good mind soon strengthened itself into a fixed resolution, and full\r\nof disdain and indignation at the supposed want of faith of the\r\nHungarian nobleman, he paused opposite the saddler\'s door.\r\n\r\nCould he but for a moment have suspected the real reason why the\r\nappointment had not been kept with him, all his curiosity would have\r\nbeen doubly aroused, and he would have followed the landlord of the inn\r\nand his associate upon the track of the second vampyre that had visited\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nBut of this he knew nothing, for that proceeding had been conducted with\r\namazing quietness; and the fact of the Hungarian nobleman, when he found\r\nthat he was followed, taking a contrary course to that in which Varney\r\nwas concealed, prevented the boy from knowing anything of his movements.\r\n\r\nHence the thing looked to him like a piece of sheer neglect and\r\ncontemptuous indifference, which he felt bound to resent.\r\n\r\nHe did not pause long at the door of the saddler\'s, but, after a few\r\nmoments, he walked boldly in, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Master Philpots, I have got something extraordinary to tell you, and\r\nyou may give me what you like for telling you."\r\n\r\n"Go on, then," said the saddler, "that\'s just the price I always likes\r\nto pay for everything."\r\n\r\n"Will you keep it secret?" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Of course I will. When did you ever hear of me telling anything to a\r\nsingle individual?"\r\n\r\n"Never to a single individual, but I have heard you tell things to the\r\nwhole town."\r\n\r\n"Confound your impudence. Get out of my shop directly."\r\n\r\n"Oh! very good. I can go and tell old Mitchell, the pork-butcher."\r\n\r\n"No, I say--stop; don\'t tell him. If anybody is to know, let it be me,\r\nand I\'ll promise you I\'ll keep it secret."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said the boy, returning, "you shall know it; and, mind, you\r\nhave promised me to keep it secret, so that if it gets known, you know\r\nit cannot be any fault of mine."\r\n\r\nThe fact was, the boy was anxious it should be known, only that in case\r\nsome consequences might arise, he thought he would quiet his own\r\nconscience, by getting a promise of secrecy from Tobias Philpots, which\r\nhe well knew that individual would not think of keeping.\r\n\r\nHe then related to him the interview he had had with the Hungarian\r\nnobleman at the inn, how he had promised a number of half-crowns, but a\r\nvery small instalment of which he had received.\r\n\r\nAll this Master Philpots cared very little for, but the information that\r\nthe dreaded Varney, the vampyre, was concealed so close to the town was\r\na matter of great and abounding interest, and at that part of the story\r\nhe suddenly pricked up his ears amazingly.\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t mean to say that?" he exclaimed. "Are you sure it was\r\nhe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am quite certain. I have seen I him more than once. It was Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, without any mistake."\r\n\r\n"Why, then you may depend he\'s only waiting until it\'s very dark, and\r\nthen he will walk into somebody, and suck his blood. Here\'s a horrid\r\ndiscovery! I thought we had had enough of Master Varney, and that he\r\nwould hardly show himself here again, and now you tell me he is not ten\r\nminutes\' walk off."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fact," said the boy. "I saw him go in, and he looks thinner and\r\nmore horrid than ever. I am sure he wants a dollop of blood from\r\nsomebody."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder."\r\n\r\n"Now there is Mrs. Philpots, you know, sir; she\'s rather big, and seems\r\nmost ready to burst always; I shouldn\'t wonder if the vampyre came to\r\nher to-night."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you?" said Mrs. Philpots, who had walked into the shop, and\r\noverheard the whole conversation; "wouldn\'t you, really? I\'ll vampyre\r\nyou, and teach you to make these remarks about respectable married\r\nwomen. You young wretch, take that, will you!"\r\n\r\nShe gave the boy such a box on the ears, that the place seemed to spin\r\nround with him. As soon as he recovered sufficiently to be enabled to\r\nwalk, he made his way from the shop with abundance of precipitation,\r\nmuch regretting that he had troubled himself to make a confidant of\r\nMaster Philpots.\r\n\r\nBut, however, he could not but tell himself that if his object was to\r\nmake a general disturbance through the whole place, he had certainly\r\nsucceeded in doing so.\r\n\r\nHe slunk home perhaps with a feeling that he might be called upon to\r\ntake part in something that might ensue, and at all events be compelled\r\nto become a guide to the place of Sir Francis Varney\'s retreat, in which\r\ncase, for all he knew, the vampyre might, by some more than mortal\r\nmeans, discover what a hand he had had in the matter, and punish him\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe moment he hid left the saddler\'s Mrs. Philpots, after using some\r\nbitter reproaches to her husband for not at once sacrificing the boy\r\nupon the spot for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of\r\nher, hastily put on her bonnet and shawl, and the saddler, although it\r\nwas a full hour before the usual time, began putting up the shutters of\r\nhis shop.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear," he said to Mrs. Philpots, when she came down stairs\r\nequipped for the streets, "why, my dear, where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"And pray, sir, what are you shutting up the shop for at this time of\r\nthe evening!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! why, the fact is, I thought I\'d just go to the Rose and Crown, and\r\nmention that the vampyre was so near at hand."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Philpots, and in that case there can be no harm in my calling\r\nupon some of my acquaintance and mentioning it likewise."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t suppose there would be much harm; only remember, Mrs.\r\nPhilpots, remember if you please---"\r\n\r\n"Remember what?"\r\n\r\n"To tell everybody to keep it secret."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course I will; and mind you do it likewise."\r\n\r\n"Most decidedly."\r\n\r\nThe shop was closed, Mr. Philpots ran off to the Rose and Crown, and\r\nMrs, Philpots, with as much expedition as she could, purposed making the\r\ngrand tour of all her female acquaintance in the town, just to tell\r\nthem, as a great secret, that the vampyre, Sir Francis Varney, as he\r\ncalled himself, had taken refuge at the house that was to let down the\r\nlane leading to Higgs\'s farm.\r\n\r\n"But by no means," she said, "let it go no further, because it is a very\r\nwrong thing to make any disturbance, and you will understand that it\'s\r\nquite a secret."\r\n\r\nShe was listened to with breathless attention, as may well be supposed,\r\nand it was a singular circumstance that at every house she left some\r\nother lady put on her bonnet and shawl, and ran out to make the circle\r\nof her acquaintance, with precisely the same story, and precisely the\r\nsame injunctions to secrecy.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Mr. Philpots pursued an extremely similar course, we are not\r\nsurprised that in the short space of one hour the news should have\r\nspread through all the town, and that there was scarcely a child old\r\nenough to understand what was being talked about, who was ignorant of\r\nthe fact, that Sir Francis Varney was to be found at the empty house\r\ndown the lane.\r\n\r\nIt was an unlucky time, too, for the night was creeping on, a period at\r\nwhich people\'s apprehension of the supernatural becomes each moment\r\nstronger and more vivid--a period at which a number of idlers are let\r\nloose for different employments, and when anything in the shape of a row\r\nor a riot presents itself in pleasant colours to those who have nothing\r\nto lose and who expect, under the cover of darkness, to be able to\r\ncommit outrages they would be afraid to think of in the daytime, when\r\nrecognition would be more easy.\r\n\r\nThus was it that Sir Francis Varney\'s position, although he knew it not,\r\nbecame momentarily one of extreme peril, and the danger he was about to\r\nrun, was certainly greater than any he had as yet experienced. Had\r\nCharles Holland but known what was going on, he would undoubtedly have\r\ndone something to preserve the supposed vampyre from the mischief that\r\nthreatened him, but the time had not arrived when he had promised to pay\r\nhim a second visit, so he had no idea of anything serious having\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, Mr. and Mrs. Philpots scarcely anticipated creating so\r\nmuch confusion, but when they found that the whole place was in an\r\nuproar, and that a tumultuous assemblage of persons called aloud for\r\nvengeance upon Varney, the vampyre, they made their way home again in no\r\nsmall fright.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, what was the result of all these proceedings will be best\r\nknown by our introducing the reader to the interior of the house in\r\nwhich Varney had found a temporary refuge, and following in detail his\r\nproceedings as he waited for the arrival of Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNT FOR VARNEY.--THE HOUSE-TOPS.--THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE.--THE LAST\r\nPLACE OF REFUGE.--THE COTTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the tree tops the moon shines brightly, and the long shadows are\r\nshooting its rays down upon the waters, and the green fields appear\r\nclothed in a flood of silver light; the little town was quiet and\r\ntranquil--nature seemed at rest.\r\n\r\nThe old mansion in which Sir Francis Varney had taken refuge, stood\r\nempty and solitary; it seemed as though it were not associated with the\r\nothers by which it was surrounded. It was gloomy, and in the moonlight\r\nit reminded one of things long gone by, existences that had once been,\r\nbut now no longer of this present time--a mere memento of the past.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney reclined upon the house-top; he gazed upon the sky,\r\nand upon the earth; he saw the calm tranquillity that reigned around,\r\nand could not but admire what he saw; he sighed, he seemed to sigh, from\r\na pleasure he felt in the fact of his security; he could repose there\r\nwithout fear, and breathe the balmy air that fanned his cheek.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he muttered, "things might have been worse, but not much\r\nworse; however, they might have been much better; the ignorant are\r\naway--the most to be feared, because they have no guide and no control,\r\nsave what can be exerted over them by their fears and their passions."\r\n\r\nHe paused to look again over the scene, and, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, and that, moonlight as it was, was many miles, the country was\r\ndiversified with hill and dale, meadow and ploughed land; the open\r\nfields, and the darker woods, and the silvery stream that ran at no\r\ngreat distance, all presented a scene that was well calculated to warm\r\nthe imagination, and to give the mind that charm which a cultivated\r\nunderstanding is capable of receiving.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing wanted to make such a scene one of pure\r\nhappiness, and that was all absence of care of fears for the future and\r\nthe wants of life.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a slight sound that came from the town. It was very\r\nslight, but the ears of Sir Francis Varney were painfully acute of late;\r\nthe least sound that came across him was heard in a moment, and his\r\nwhole visage was changed to one of listening interest.\r\n\r\nThe sound was hushed; but his attention was not lulled, for he had been\r\nplaced in circumstances that made all his vigilance necessary for his\r\nown preservation. Hence it was, what another would have passed over, or\r\nnot heard at all, he both heard and noticed. He was not sure of the\r\nnature of the sound, it was so slight and so indistinct.\r\n\r\nThere it was again! Some persons were moving about in the town. The\r\nsounds that came upon the night air seemed to say that there was an\r\nunusual bustle in the town, which was, to Sir Francis Varney, ominous in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nWhat could people in such a quiet, retired place require out at such an\r\nhour at night? It must be something very unusual--something that must\r\nexcite them to a great degree; and Sir Francis began to feel very\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n"They surely," he muttered to himself--"they surely cannot have found\r\nout my hiding place, and intend to hunt me from it, the blood-thirsty\r\nhounds! they are never satisfied. The mischief they are permitted to do\r\non one occasion is but the precursor to another. The taste has caused\r\nthe appetite for more, and nothing short of his blood can satisfy it."\r\n\r\nThe sounds increased, and the noise came nearer and nearer, and it\r\nappeared as though a number of men had collected together and were\r\ncoming towards him. Yes, they were coming down the lane towards the\r\ndeserted mansion where he was.\r\n\r\nFor once in his life, Sir Francis Varney trembled; he felt sick at\r\nheart, though no man was less likely to give up hope and to despair than\r\nhe; yet this sign of unrelenting hatred and persecution was too\r\nunequivocal and too stern not to produce its effect upon even his mind;\r\nfor he had no doubt but that they were coming with the express purpose\r\nof seeking him.\r\n\r\nHow they could have found him out was a matter he could not imagine. The\r\nBannerworths could not have betrayed him--he was sure of that; and yet\r\nwho could have seen him, so cautious and so careful as he had been, and\r\nso very sparing had he lived, because he would not give the slightest\r\ncause for all that was about to follow. He hoped to have hidden himself;\r\nbut now he could hear the tramp of men distinctly, and their voices came\r\nnow on the night air, though it was in a subdued tone, as if they were\r\ndesirous of approaching unheard and unseen by their victim.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney stirred not from his position. He remained silent and\r\nmotionless. He appeared not to heed what was going on; perhaps he hoped\r\nto see them go by--to be upon some false scent; or, if they saw no signs\r\nof life, they might leave the place, and go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHark! they stop at the house--they go not by; they seem to pause, and\r\nthen a thundering knock came at the door, which echoed and re-echoed\r\nthrough the empty and deserted house, on the top of which sat, in silent\r\nexpectation, the almost motionless Sir Francis Varney, the redoubted\r\nvampyre.\r\n\r\nThe knock which came so loud and so hard upon the door caused Sir\r\n\r\nFrancis to start visibly, for it seemed his own knell. Then, as if the\r\nmob were satisfied with their knowledge of his presence, and of their\r\nvictory, and of his inability to escape them, they sent up a loud shout\r\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with its sound.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to come from below and around the house; it rose from all\r\nsides, and that told Sir Francis Varney that the house was surrounded\r\nand all escape was cut off; there was no chance of his being able to\r\nrush through such a multitude of men as that which now encircled him.\r\n\r\nWith the calmest despair, Sir Francis Varney lay still and motionless on\r\nthe house-top, and listened to the sounds that proceeded from below.\r\nShout after shout arose on the still, calm air of the night; knock after\r\nknock came upon the stout old door, which awakened responsive echoes\r\nthroughout the house that had for many years lain dormant, and which now\r\nseemed disturbed, and resounded in hollow murmurs to the voices from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nThen a loud voice shouted from below, as if to be heard by any one who\r\nmight be within,--\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre, come out and give yourself up at\r\ndiscretion! If we have to search for you, you may depend it will be to\r\npunish you; you will suffer by burning. Come out and give yourself up."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then a loud shout.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney paid no attention to this summons, but sat,\r\nmotionless, on the house-top, where he could hear all that passed below\r\nin the crowd.\r\n\r\n"He will not come out," said one.\r\n\r\n"Ah! he\'s much too cunning to be caught in such a trap. Why, he knows\r\nwhat you would do with him; he knows you would stake him, and make a\r\nbonfire about him."\r\n\r\n"So he has no taste for roasting," remarked another; "but still, it\'s no\r\nuse hiding; we have too many hands, and know the house too well to be\r\neasily baffled."\r\n\r\n"That may be; and, although he don\'t like burning, yet we will unearth\r\nthe old fox, somehow or other; we have discovered his haunt at last, and\r\ncertainly we\'ll have him out."\r\n\r\n"How shall we get in?"\r\n\r\n"Knock in the door--break open the door! the front door--that is the\r\nbest, because it leads to all parts of the house, and we can secure any\r\none who attempts to move from one to the other, as they come down."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted several men in the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" echoed the mob, with one accord, and the shout rent the air,\r\nand disturbed the quietude and serenity that scarce five minutes before\r\nreigned through the place.\r\n\r\nThen, as if actuated by one spirit, they all set to work to force the\r\ndoor in. It was strong, and capable of great defence, and employed them,\r\nwith some labour, for fifteen or twenty minutes, and then, with a loud\r\ncrash, the door fell in.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" again shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\nThese shouts announced the fall of the door, and then, and not until\r\nthen, did Sir Francis Varney stir.\r\n\r\n"They have broken in the door," he muttered, "well, if die I must, I\r\nwill sell my life dearly. However, all is not yet lost, and, in the\r\nstruggle for life, the loss is not so much felt."\r\n\r\nHe got up, and crept towards the trap that led into the house, or out of\r\nit, as the occasion might require.\r\n\r\n"The vampyre! the vampyre!" shouted a man who stood on a garden wall,\r\nholding on by the arm of an apple-tree.\r\n\r\n"Varney, the vampyre!" shouted a second.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! boys, we are on the right scent; now for a hunt; hurrah! we\r\nshall have him now."\r\n\r\nThey rushed in a tumultuous riot up the stone steps, and into the hall.\r\nIt was a large, spacious place, with a grand staircase that led up to\r\nthe upper floor, but it had two ends, and then terminated in a gallery.\r\n\r\nIt could not be defended by one man, save at the top, where it could not\r\nlong be held, because the assailants could unite, and throw their whole\r\nweight against the entrance, and thus storm it. This actually happened.\r\n\r\nThey looked up, and, seeing nobody, they rushed up, some by one stair,\r\nand some by the other; but it was dark; there were but few of the moon\'s\r\nrays that pierced the gloom of that place, and those who first reached\r\nthe place which we have named, were seized with astonishment, staggered,\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney had met them; he stood there with a staff--something\r\nhe had found about the house--not quite so long as a broom-handle, but\r\nsomewhat thicker and heavier, being made of stout ash.\r\n\r\nThis formidable weapon, Sir Francis Varney wielded with strength and\r\nresolution; he was a tall man, and one of no mean activity and personal\r\nstrength, and such a weapon, in his hands, was one of a most fearful\r\ncharacter, and, for the occasion, much better than his sword.\r\n\r\nMan after man fell beneath the fearful brace of these blows, for though\r\nthey could not see Sir Francis, yet he could see them, or the\r\nhall-lights were behind them at the time, while he stood in the dark,\r\nand took advantage of this to deal murderous blows upon his assailants.\r\n\r\nThis continued for some minutes, till they gave way before such a\r\nvigorous defence, and paused.\r\n\r\n"On, neighbours, on," cried one; "will you be beaten off by one man?\r\nRush in at once and you must force him from his position--push him hard,\r\nand he must give way."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said one fellow who sat upon the ground rubbing his head; "it\'s\r\nall very well to say push him hard, but if you felt the weight of that\r\nd----d pole on your head, you wouldn\'t be in such a blessed hurry."\r\n\r\nHowever true that might be, there was but little attention paid to it,\r\nand a determined rush was made at the entrance to the gallery, and they\r\nfound that it was unoccupied; and that was explained by the slamming of\r\na door, and its being immediately locked upon them; and when the mob\r\ncame to the door, they found they had to break their way through another\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThis did not take long in effecting; and in less than five minutes they\r\nhad broken through that door which led into another room; but the first\r\nman who entered it fell from a crashing blow on the head from the ashen\r\nstaff of Sir Francis Varney, who hurried and fled, closely pursued,\r\nuntil he came to another door, through which he dashed.\r\n\r\nHere he endeavoured to make a stand and close it, but was immediately\r\nstruck and grappled with; but he threw his assailant, and turned and\r\nfled again.\r\n\r\nHis object had been to defend each inch of the ground as long as he was\r\nable; but he found they came too close upon his steps, and prevented his\r\nturning in time to try the strength of his staff upon the foremost.\r\n\r\nHe dashed up the first staircase with surprising rapidity, leaving his\r\npursuers behind; and when he had gained the first landing, he turned\r\nupon those who pursued him, who could hardly follow him two abreast.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" shouted the first, who rushed up heedless of\r\nthe staff.\r\n\r\n"Down with a fool!" thundered Varney, as he struck the fellow a terrific\r\nblow, which covered his face with blood, and he fell back into the arms\r\nof his companions.\r\n\r\nA bitter groan and execration arose from them below, and again they\r\nshouted, and rushed up headlong.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" was again shouted, and met by a corresponding,\r\nbut deep guttural sound of--\r\n\r\n"Down with a fool!"\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough the first again came to the earth without any\r\npreparation, save the application of an ashen stick to his skull, which,\r\nby-the-bye, no means aided the operation of thinking.\r\n\r\nSeveral more shared a similar fate; but they pressed hard, and Sir\r\nFrancis was compelled to give ground to keep them at the necessary\r\nlength from him, as they rushed on regardless of his blows, and if he\r\nhad not he would soon have been engaged in a personal struggle, for they\r\nwere getting too close for him to use the staff.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" was the renewed cry, as they drove him from\r\nspot to spot until he reached the roof of the house, and then he ran up\r\nthe steps to the loft, which he had just reached when they came up to\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nVarney attempted to draw the ladder up but four or five stout men held\r\nthat down; then by a sudden turn, as they were getting up, he turned it\r\nover, threw those on it down, and the ladder too, upon the heads of\r\nthose who were below.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!" shouted the mob, as they, with the most\r\nuntiring energy, set the ladder, or steps, against the loft, and as many\r\nas could held it, while others rushed up to attack Varney with all the\r\nferocity and courage of so many bull dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, but the more they were baffled the more enraged and\r\ndetermined they rushed on to a new attack, with greater resolution than\r\never.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, however, they were met with a new kind of missile, for\r\nSir Francis had either collected and placed there for the occasion, or\r\nthey had been left there for years, a number of old bricks, which lay\r\nclose at hand. These he took, one by one, and deliberately took aim at\r\nthem, and flung them with great force, striking down every one they hit.\r\n\r\nThis caused them to recoil; the bricks caused fearful gashes in their\r\nheads, and the wounds were serious, the flesh being, in many places,\r\ntorn completely off. They however, only paused, for one man said,--\r\n\r\n"Be of good heart, comrades, we can do as he does; he has furnished us\r\nwith weapons, and we can thus attack him in two ways, and he must give\r\nway in the end."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! down with the vampyre!" sounded from all sides, and the shout\r\nwas answered by a corresponding rush.\r\n\r\nIt was true; Sir Francis had furnished them with weapons to attack\r\nhimself, for they could throw them back at him, which they did, and\r\nstruck him a severe blow on the head, and it covered his face with blood\r\nin a moment.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the assailants; "another such a blow, and all will be\r\nover with the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got--"\r\n\r\n"Press him sharp, now," cried another man, as he aimed another blow with\r\na brick, which struck Varney on the arm, causing him to drop the brick\r\nhe held in his hand. He staggered back, apparently in great pain.\r\n\r\n"Up! up! we have him now; he cannot get away; he\'s hurt; we have him--we\r\nhave him."\r\n\r\nAnd up they went with all the rapidity they could scramble up the steps;\r\nbut this had given Varney time to recover himself; and though his right\r\narm was almost useless, yet he contrived, with his left, to pitch the\r\nbricks so as to knock over the first three or four, when, seeing that he\r\ncould not maintain his position to advantage, he rushed to the outside\r\nof the house, the last place he had capable of defence.\r\n\r\nThere was a great shout by those outside, when they saw him come out and\r\nstand with his staff, and those who came first got first served, for the\r\nblows resounded, while he struck them, and sent them over below.\r\n\r\nThen came a great shout from within and without, and then a desperate\r\nrush was made at the door, and, in the next instant, Varney was seen\r\nflying, followed by his pursuers, one after the other, some tumbling\r\nover the tiles, to the imminent hazard of their necks.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney rushed along with a speed that appeared by far too\r\ngreat to admit of being safely followed, and yet those who followed\r\nappeared infected by his example, and appeared heedless of all\r\nconsequences by which their pursuit might be attended to themselves.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob below.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" answered the mob on the tiles.\r\n\r\nThen, over several housetops might be seen the flying figure of Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, pursued by different men at a pace almost equal to his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThey, however, could keep up the same speed, and not improve upon it,\r\nwhile he kept the advantage he first obtained in the start.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the spectators below that he had dropped through a house,\r\nand they immediately surrounded the house, as well as they could, and\r\nthen set up another shout.\r\n\r\nThis took place several times, and as often was the miserable man hunted\r\nfrom his place of refuge only to seek another, from which he was in like\r\nmanner hunted by those who thirsted for his blood.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, they drove him into a house which was surrounded, save\r\nat one point, which had a long room, or building in it, that ran some\r\ndistance out, and about twenty feet high.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the roof of this place, or leads, he stood and\r\ndefended himself for some moments with success; but having received a\r\nblow himself, he was compelled to retire, while the mob behind forced\r\nthose in front forward faster than he could by any exertion wield the\r\nstaff that had so much befriended him on this occasion.\r\n\r\nHe was, therefore, on the point of being overwhelmed by numbers, when he\r\nfled; but, alas! there was no escape; a bare coping stone and rails ran\r\nround the top of that.\r\n\r\nThere was not much time for hesitation, but he jumped over the rails and\r\nlooked below. It was a great height, but if he fell and hurt himself, he\r\nknew he was at the mercy of the bloodhounds behind him, who would do\r\nanything but show him any mercy, or spare him a single pang.\r\n\r\nHe looked round and beheld his pursuers close upon him, and one was so\r\nclose to him that he seized upon his arm, saying, as he shouted to his\r\ncompanions,--\r\n\r\n"Hurrah, boys! I have him."\r\n\r\nWith an execration, Sir Francis wielded his staff with such force, that\r\nhe struck the fellow on the head, crushing in his hat as if it had been\r\nonly so much paper. The man fell, but a blow followed from some one else\r\nwhich caused Varney to relax his hold, and finding himself falling, he,\r\nto save himself, sprang away.\r\n\r\nThe rails, at that moment, were crowded with men who leaned over to\r\nascertain the effect of the leap.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be killed," said one.\r\n\r\n"He\'s sure to be smashed," said another.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll lay any wager he\'ll break a limb!" said a third.\r\n\r\nVarney came to the earth--for a moment he lay stunned, and not able to\r\nmove hand or foot.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" shouted the mob.\r\n\r\nTheir triumph was short, for just as they shouted Varney arose, and\r\nafter a moment or two\'s stagger he set off at full speed, which produced\r\nanother shout from the mob; and just at that moment, a body of his\r\npursuers were seen scaling the walls after him.\r\n\r\nThere was now a hunt through all the adjoining fields--from cover after\r\ncover they pursued him until he found no rest from the hungry wolves\r\nthat beset him with cries, resembling beasts of prey rather than any\r\nhuman multitude.\r\n\r\nSir Francis heard them, at the same time, with the despair of a man who\r\nis struggling for life, and yet knows he is struggling in vain; he knew\r\nhis strength was decaying--his immense exertions and the blows he had\r\nreceived, all weakened him, while the number and strength of his foes\r\nseemed rather to increase than to diminish.\r\n\r\nOnce more he sought the houses, and for a moment he believed himself\r\nsafe, but that was only a momentary deception, for they had traced him.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at a garden wall, over which he bounded, and then he rushed\r\ninto the house, the door of which stood open, for the noise and\r\ndisturbance had awakened most of the inhabitants, who were out in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nHe took refuge in a small closet on the stairs, but was seen to do so by\r\na girl, who screamed out with fear and fright,\r\n\r\n"Murder! murder!--the wampyre!--the wampyre!" with all her strength, and\r\nin the way of screaming that was no little, and then she went off into a\r\nfit.\r\n\r\nThis was signal enough, and the house was at once entered, and beset on\r\nall sides by the mob, who came impatient of obtaining their victim who\r\nhad so often baffled them.\r\n\r\n"There he is--there he is," said the girl, who came to as soon as other\r\npeople came up.\r\n\r\n"Where?--where?"\r\n\r\n"In that closet," she said, pointing to it with her finger. "I see\'d him\r\ngo in the way above."\r\n\r\nSir Francis, finding himself betrayed, immediately came out of the\r\ncloset, just as two or three were advancing to open it, and dealt so\r\nhard a blow on the head of the first that came near him that he fell\r\nwithout a groan, and a second shared the same fate; and then Sir Francis\r\nfound himself grappled with, but with a violent effort he relieved\r\nhimself and rushed up stairs.\r\n\r\n"Oh! murder--the wampyre! what shall I do--fire--fire!"\r\n\r\nThese exclamations were uttered in consequence of Varney in his haste to\r\nget up stairs, having inadvertently stepped into the girl\'s lap with one\r\nfoot, while he kicked her in the chin with the other, besides scratching\r\nher nose till it bled.\r\n\r\n"After him--stick to him," shouted the mob, but the girl kicked and\r\nsprawled so much they were impeded, till, regardless of her cries, they\r\nran over her and pursued Varney, who was much distressed with the\r\nexertions he had made.\r\n\r\nAfter about a minute\'s race he turned upon the head of the stair, not so\r\nmuch with the hope of defending it as of taking some breathing time: but\r\nseeing his enemies so close, he drew his sword, and stood panting, but\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n"Never mind his toasting-fork," said one bulky fellow, and, as he spoke,\r\nhe rushed on, but the point of the weapon entered his heart and he fell\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful execration uttered by those who came up after him,\r\nand there was a momentary pause, for none liked to rush on to the bloody\r\nsword of Sir Francis Varney, who stood so willing and so capable of\r\nusing it with the most deadly effect. They paused, as well they might,\r\nand this pause was the most welcome thing next to life to the\r\nunfortunate fugitive, for he was dreadfully distressed and bleeding.\r\n\r\n"On to him boys! He can hardly stand. See how he pants. On to him, I\r\nsay--push him hard."\r\n\r\n"He pushes hard, I tell you," said another. "I felt the point of his\r\nsword, as it came through Giles\'s back.".\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try my luck, then," said another, and he rushed up; but he was met\r\nby the sword of Sir Francis, who pierced it through his side, and he\r\nfell back with a groan.\r\n\r\nSir Francis, fearful of stopping any longer to defend that point,\r\nappeared desirous of making good his retreat with some little advantage,\r\nand he rushed up stairs before they had recovered from the momentary\r\nconsternation into which they had been thrown by the sudden disaster\r\nthey had received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut they were quickly after him, and before he, wearied as he was, could\r\ngain the roof, they were up the ladder after him.\r\n\r\nThe first man who came through the trap was again set upon by Varney,\r\nwho made a desperate thrust at him, and it took effect; but the sword\r\nsnapped by the handle.\r\n\r\nWith an execration, Sir Francis threw the hilt at the head of the next\r\nman he saw; then rushing, with headlong speed, he distanced his pursuers\r\nfor some house tops.\r\n\r\nBut the row of houses ended at the one he was then at, and he could go\r\nno further. What was to be done? The height was by far too great to be\r\njumped; death was certain. A hideous heap of crushed and mangled bones\r\nwould be the extent of what would remain of him, and then, perhaps, life\r\nnot extinct for some hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nHe turned round; he saw them coming hallooing over the house tops, like\r\na pack of hounds. Sir Francis struck his hands together, and groaned. He\r\nlooked round, and perceived some ivy peeping over the coping-stone. A\r\nthought struck him, and he instantly ran to the spot and leaned over.\r\n\r\n"Saved--saved!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen, placing his hand over, he felt for the ivy; then he got over, and\r\nhung by the coping-stone, in a perilous position, till he found a spot\r\non which he could rest his foot, and then he grasped the ivy as low down\r\nas he could, and thus he lowered himself a short way, till he came to\r\nwhere the ivy was stronger and more secure to the wall, as the upper\r\npart was very dangerous with his weight attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe mob came on, very sure of having Sir Francis Varney in their power,\r\nand they did not hurry on so violently, as their position was dangerous\r\nat that hour of the night.\r\n\r\n"Easy, boys, easy," was the cry. "The bird is our own; he can\'t get\r\naway, that\'s very certain."\r\n\r\nThey, however, came on, and took no time about it hardly; but what was\r\ntheir amazement and rage at finding he had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" was the universal inquiry, and "I don\'t know," an almost\r\nuniversal answer.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, while they searched around; but they saw no\r\nvestige of the object of their search.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no trap door open," remarked one; "and I don\'t think he could\r\nhave got in at any one."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, finding he could not get away, he has taken the desperate\r\nexpedient of jumping over, and committing suicide, and so escape the\r\ndoom he ought to be subjected to."\r\n\r\n"Probably he has; but then we can run a stake through him and burn him\r\nall the same."\r\n\r\nThey now approached the extreme verge of the houses, and looked over the\r\nsides, but they could see nothing. The moon was up, and there was light\r\nenough to have seen him if he had fallen to the earth, and they were\r\nquite sure that he could not have got up after such a fall as he must\r\nhave received.\r\n\r\n"We are beaten after all, neighbours."\r\n\r\n"I am not so sure of that," was the reply. "He may now be hidden about,\r\nfor he was too far spent to be able to go far; he could not do that, I\r\nam sure."\r\n\r\n"I think not either."\r\n\r\n"Might he not have escaped by means of that ivy, yonder?" said one of\r\nthe men, pointing to the plant, as it climbed over the coping-stones of\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it may be possible," said one; "and yet it is very dangerous, if\r\nnot certain destruction to get over."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; there is no possibility of escape that way. Why, it wouldn\'t\r\nbear a cat, for there are no nails driven into the wall at this height."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said another, "we may as well leave no stone unturned, as\r\nthe saying is, but at once set about looking out for him."\r\n\r\nThe individual who spoke now leant over the coping stone, for some\r\nmoments, in silence. He could see nothing, but yet he continued to gaze\r\nfor some moments.\r\n\r\n"Do you see him?" inquired one.\r\n\r\n"No," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, I thought as much," was the reply. "He might as well have got\r\nhold of a corner of the moon, which, I believe, is more likely--a great\r\ndeal more likely."\r\n\r\n"Hold still a moment," said the man, who was looking over the edge of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now? A gnat flew into your eye?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I see him--by Jove, I see him!"\r\n\r\n"See who--see who?"\r\n\r\n"Varney, the vampyre!" shouted the man. "I see him about half-way down\r\nclinging, like a fly, to the wall. Odd zounds! I never saw the like\r\nafore!"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! after him then, boys!"\r\n\r\n"Not the same way, if you please. Go yourself, and welcome; but I won\'t\r\ngo that way."\r\n\r\n"Just as you please," said the man; "but what\'s good for the goose is\r\ngood for the gander is an old saying, and so is Jack as good as his\r\nmaster."\r\n\r\n"So it may be; but cuss me if you ain\'t a fool if you attempt that!"\r\n\r\nThe man made no reply, but did as Varney had done before, got over the\r\ncoping stone, and then laid hold of the ivy; but, whether his weight was\r\nheavier than Varney\'s, or whether it was that the latter had loosened\r\nthe hold of the ivy or not, but he had no sooner left go of the coping\r\nstone than the ivy gave way, and he was precipitated from the height of\r\nabout fifty feet to the earth--a dreadful fall!\r\n\r\nThere was a pause--no one spoke. The man lay motionless and dead--he had\r\ndislocated his neck!\r\n\r\nThe fall had not, however, been without its effect upon Varney, for the\r\nman\'s heels struck him so forcibly on his head as he fell, that he was\r\nstunned, and let go his hold, and he, too, fell to the earth, but not\r\nmany feet.\r\n\r\nHe soon recovered himself, and was staggering away, when he was assailed\r\nby those above with groans, and curses of all kinds, and then by stones,\r\nand tiles, and whatever the mob could lay their hands upon.\r\n\r\nSome of these struck him, and he was cut about in various places, so\r\nthat he could hardly stand.\r\n\r\nThe hoots and shouts of the mob above had now attracted those below to\r\nthe spot where Sir Francis Varney was trying to escape, but he had not\r\ngone far before the loud yells of those behind him told him that he was\r\nagain pursued.\r\n\r\nHalf dead, and almost wholly spent, unarmed, and defenceless, he scarce\r\nknew what to do; whether to fly, or to turn round and die as a refuge\r\nfrom the greater evil of endeavouring to prolong a struggle which seemed\r\nhopeless. Instinct, however, urged him on, at all risks, and though he\r\ncould not go very far, or fast, yet on he went, with the crowd after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Down with the vampyre!--seize him--hold him--burn him! he must be down\r\npresently, he can\'t stand!"\r\n\r\nThis gave them new hopes, and rendered Varney\'s fate almost certain.\r\nThey renewed their exertions to overtake him, while he exerted himself\r\nanew, and with surprising agility, considering how he had been employed\r\nfor more than two hours.\r\n\r\nThere were some trees and hedges now that opposed the progress of both\r\nparties. The height of Sir Francis Varney gave him a great advantage,\r\nand, had he been fresh, he might have shown it to advantage in vaulting\r\nover the hedges and ditches, which he jumped when obliged, and walked\r\nthrough when he could.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, the party in pursuit, who had been behind him some\r\ndistance, now they gained on him; however, they kept, every now and\r\nthen, losing sight of him among the trees and shrubs, and he made direct\r\nfor a small wood, hoping that when there, he should to be able to\r\nconceal himself for some time, so as to throw his pursuers off the\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThey were well aware of this, for they increased their speed, and one or\r\ntwo swifter of foot than the others, got a-head of them and cried out\r\naloud as they ran,--\r\n\r\n"Keep up! keep up! he\'s making for the wood."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t stop there long; there are too many of us to beat that cover\r\nwithout finding our game. Push, lads, he\'s our own now, as sure as we\r\nknow he\'s on a-head."\r\n\r\nThey did push on, and came in full sight as they saw Sir Francis enter\r\nthe wood, with what speed he could make; but he was almost spent. This\r\nwas a cheering sight to them, and they were pretty certain he would not\r\nleave the wood in the state he was then--he must seek concealment.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were mistaken, for Sir Francis Varney, as soon as he got\r\ninto the wood, plunged into the thickest of it, and then paused to gain\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"So far safe," he muttered; "but I have had a narrow escape; they are\r\nnot yet done, though, and it will not be safe here long. I must away,\r\nand seek shelter and safety elsewhere, if I can;--curses on the hounds\r\nthat run yelping over the fields!"\r\n\r\nHe heard the shouts of his pursuers, and prepared to quit the wood when\r\nhe thought the first had entered it.\r\n\r\n"They will remain here some time in beating about," he muttered; "that\r\nis the only chance I have had since the pursuit; curse them! I say\r\nagain. I may now get free; this delay must save my life, but nothing\r\nelse will."\r\n\r\nHe moved away, and, at a slow and lazy pace, left the wood, and then\r\nmade his way across some fields, towards some cottages, that lay on the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe moon yet shone on the fields; he could hear the shouts of the mob,\r\nas various parties went through the wood from one covert to another, and\r\nyet unable to find him.\r\n\r\nThen came a great shout upon his ears, as though they had found out he\r\nhad left the wood. This caused him to redouble his speed, and, fearful\r\nlest he should be seen in the moonlight, he leaped over the first fence\r\nthat he came to, with almost the last effort he could make, and then\r\nstaggered in at an open door--through a passage--into a front parlour,\r\nand there fell, faint, and utterly spent and speechless, at the feet of\r\nFlora Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECEPTION OF THE VAMPYRE BY FLORA.--VARNEY SUBDUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe must say that the irruption into the house of the Bannerworths by Sir\r\nFrancis Varney, was certainly unpremeditated by him, for he knew not\r\ninto whose house he had thus suddenly rushed for refuge from the\r\nnumerous foes who were pursuing him with such vengeful ire. It was a\r\nstrange and singular incident, and one well calculated to cause the mind\r\nto pause before it passed it by, and consider the means to an end which\r\nare sometimes as wide of the mark, as it is in nature possible to be.\r\n\r\nBut truth is stronger than fiction by far, and the end of it was, that,\r\npressed on all sides by danger, bleeding, faint, and exhausted, he\r\nrushed into the first house he came to, and thus placed himself in the\r\nvery house of those whom he had brought to such a state of misfortune.\r\n\r\nFlora Bannerworth was seated at some embroidery, to pass away an hour or\r\nso, and thus get over the tedium of time; she was not thinking, either,\r\nupon the unhappy past; some trifling object or other engaged her\r\nattention. But what was her anguish when she saw a man staggering into\r\nthe room bleeding, and bearing the marks of a bloody contest, and\r\nsinking at her feet.\r\n\r\nHer astonishment was far greater yet, when she recognised that man to be\r\nSir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"Save me!--save me! Miss Bannerworth, save me!--only you can save me\r\nfrom the ruthless multitude which follows, crying aloud for my blood."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he sank down speechless. Flora was so much amazed, not to\r\nsay terrified, that she knew not what to do. She saw Sir Francis a\r\nsuppliant at her feet, a fugitive from his enemies, who would show him\r\nno mercy--she saw all this at a moment\'s glance; and yet she had not\r\nrecovered her speech and presence of mind enough to enable her to make\r\nany reply to him.\r\n\r\n"Save me! Miss Flora Bannerworth, save me!" he again said, raising\r\nhimself on his hands. "I am beset, hunted like a wild beast--they seek\r\nmy life--they have pursued me from one spot to another, and I have\r\nunwittingly intruded upon you. You will save me: I am sure your kindness\r\nand goodness of heart will never permit me to be turned out among such a\r\ncrew of blood-thirsty butchers as those who pursue me are."\r\n\r\n"Rise, Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, after a moment\'s hesitation; "in\r\nsuch an extremity as that which you are in, it would be inhuman indeed\r\nto thrust you out among your enemies."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it would," said Varney. "I had thought, until now, I could have\r\nfaced such a mob, until I was in this extremity; and then, disarmed and\r\nthrown down, bruised, beaten, and incapable of stemming such a torrent,\r\nI fled from one place to another, till hunted from each, and then\r\ninstinct alone urged me to greater exertion than before, and here I\r\nam--this is now my last and only hope."\r\n\r\n"Rise, Sir Francis."\r\n\r\n"You will not let me be torn out and slaughtered like an ox. I am sure\r\nyou will not."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis, we are incapable of such conduct; you have sought refuge\r\nhere, and shall find it as far as we are able to afford it to you."\r\n\r\n"And your brother--and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--all who are here will do the same; but here they come to\r\nspeak for themselves."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Bannerworth entered, also Charles Holland, who both\r\nstarted on seeing the vampyre present, Sir Francis Varney, who was too\r\nweak to rise without assistance.\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, speaking to them as they entered, "has\r\nsought refuge here; his life is in peril, and he has no other hope left;\r\nyou will, I am sure, do what can be done for him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Holland," said Sir Francis, "I am, as you may see by my condition,\r\na fugitive, and have been beaten almost to death; instinct alone urged\r\nme on to save my life, and I, unknowingly, came in here."\r\n\r\n"Rise, Sir Francis," said Charles Holland; "I am not one who would feel\r\nany pleasure in seeing you become the victim of any brutal mob. I am\r\nsure there are none amongst us who would willingly do so. You have\r\ntrusted to those who will not betray you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Sir Francis, faintly. "I thank you; your conduct is\r\nnoble, and Miss Bannerworth\'s especially so."\r\n\r\n"Are you much hurt, Sir Francis?" inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n"I am much hurt, but not seriously or dangerously; but I am weak and\r\nexhausted."\r\n\r\n"Let me assist you to rise," said Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Sir Francis, as he accepted of the assistance, and\r\nwhen he stood up, he found how incapable he really was, for a child\r\nmight have grappled with him.\r\n\r\n"I have been sore beset, Mrs. Bannerworth," he said, endeavouring to bow\r\nto that lady; "and I have suffered much ill-usage. I am not in such a\r\nplight as I could wish to be seen in by ladies; but my reasons for\r\ncoming will be an excuse for my appearance in such disorder."\r\n\r\n"We will not say anything about that," said Charles Holland; "under the\r\ncircumstances, it could not be otherwise."\r\n\r\n"It could not," said Sir Francis, as he took the chair Miss Flora\r\nBannerworth placed for him.\r\n\r\n"I will not ask you for any explanation as to how this came about; but\r\nyou need some restorative and rest."\r\n\r\n"I think I suffer more from exhaustion than anything else. The bruises I\r\nhave, of course, are not dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Can you step aside a few moments?" said Mrs. Bannerworth. "I will show\r\nyou where you can remove some of those stains, and make yourself more\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, madam--thank you. It will be most welcome to me, I assure\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nSir Francis rose up, and, with the aid of Charles Holland, he walked to\r\nthe next room, where he washed himself, and arranged his dress as well\r\nas it would admit of its being done.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Holland," he said, "I cannot tell you how grateful I feel for this.\r\nI have been hunted from the house where you saw me. From what source\r\nthey learned my abode--my place of concealment--I know not; but they\r\nfound me out."\r\n\r\n"I need hardly say, Sir Francis, that it could not have occurred through\r\nme," said Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"My young friend," said Sir Francis, "I am quite sure you were not; and,\r\nmoreover, I never, for one moment, suspected you. No, no; some\r\naccidental circumstance alone has been the cause. I have been very\r\ncautious--I may say extremely so--but at the same time, living, as I\r\nhave, surrounded by enemies on all sides, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat I should be seen by some one, and thus traced to my lair, whither\r\nthey followed me at their leisure."\r\n\r\n"They have been but too troublesome in this matter. When they become a\r\nlittle reasonable, it will be a great miracle; for, when their passions\r\nand fears are excited, there is no end to the extremes they will\r\nperpetrate."\r\n\r\n"It is so," said Varney, "as the history of these last few days amply\r\ntestifies to me. I could never have credited the extent to which popular\r\nexcitement could be carried, and the results it was likely to produce."\r\n\r\n"It is an engine of very difficult control," pursued Charles Holland;\r\n"but what will raise it will not allay it, but add fuel to the fire that\r\nburns so fiercely already."\r\n\r\n"True enough," said Sir Francis.\r\n\r\n"If you have done, will you again step this way?"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney followed Charles Holland into the sitting-room, and\r\nsat down with them, and before him was spread a light supper, with some\r\ngood wine.\r\n\r\n"Eat, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Bannerworth. "Such a state as that in\r\nwhich you are, must, of necessity, produce great exhaustion, and you\r\nmust require food and drink."\r\n\r\nSir Francis bowed as well as he was able, and even then, sore and\r\nbruised as he was, fugitive as he had been, he could not forget his\r\ncourtesy; but it was not without an effort. His equanimity was, however,\r\nmuch disturbed, by finding himself in the midst of the Bannerworths.\r\n\r\n"I owe you a relation," he said, "of what occurred to drive me from my\r\nplace of concealment."\r\n\r\n"We should like to hear it, if you are not too far fatigued to relate\r\nit," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"I will. I was sitting at the top of that house in which I sought to\r\nhide myself, when I heard sounds come that were of a very suspicious\r\nnature; but did not believe that it could happen that they had\r\ndiscovered my lurking-place; far from it; though, of late, I had been\r\nhabitually cautious and suspicious, yet I thought I was safe, till I\r\nheard the noise of a multitude coming towards me. I could not be\r\nmistaken in it, for the sounds are so peculiar that they are like\r\nnothing else. I heard them coming.\r\n\r\n"I moved not; and when they surrounded the house as far as was\r\npracticable, they gave an immense shout, and made the welkin ring with\r\nthe sound."\r\n\r\n"I heard a confused noise at a distance," remarked Flora; "but I had no\r\nidea that anything serious was contemplated. I imagined it was some\r\nfestival among some trade, or portion of the townspeople, who were\r\nshouting from joy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no," said Sir Francis; "but I am not surprised at the mistake,\r\nbecause there are such occurrences occasionally; but whenever the mob\r\ngained any advantage upon me they shouted, and when I was able to oppose\r\nthem with effect, they groaned at me most horribly."\r\n\r\n"The deuce," said Charles; "the sound, suppose, serves to express their\r\nfeelings, and to encourage each other."\r\n\r\n"Something of the sort, I dare say," said Varney: "but at length, after\r\ndefending the house with all the desperation that despair imparted to\r\nme, I was compelled to fly from floor to floor, until I had reached the\r\nroof; there they followed me, and I was compelled again to fly. House\r\nafter house they followed me to, until I could go no farther," said\r\nVarney.\r\n\r\n"How did you escape?"\r\n\r\n"Fortunately I saw some ivy growing and creeping over the coping-stones,\r\nand by grasping that I got over the side, and so let myself down by\r\ndegrees, as well as I was able."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! what a dreadful situation," exclaimed Flora; "it is\r\nreally horrible!"\r\n\r\n"I could not do it again, under, I think, any circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Not the same?" said Mrs. Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"I really doubt if I could," said Varney. "The truth is, the excitement\r\nof the moment was great, and I at that moment thought of nothing but\r\ngetting away.\r\n\r\n"The same circumstances, the same fear of death, could hardly be\r\nproduced in me again, and I am unable to account for the phenomenon on\r\nthis occasion."\r\n\r\n"Your escape was very narrow indeed," said Flora; "it makes me shudder\r\nto think of the dangers you have gone through; it is really terrible to\r\nthink of it."\r\n\r\n"You," said Sir Francis, "are young and susceptible, and generous in\r\nyour disposition, You can feel for me, and do; but how little I could\r\nhave expected it, it is impossible to say; but your sympathy sinks into\r\nmy mind and causes such emotions as never can be erased from my soul.\r\n\r\n"But to proceed. You may guess how dreadful was my position, by the fact\r\nthat the first man who attempted to get over tore the ivy away and fell,\r\nstriking me in his fall; he was killed, and I thrown down and stunned. I\r\nthen made for the wood, closely pursued and got into it; then I baffled\r\nthem: they searched the wood, and I went through it. I then ran across\r\nthe country to these houses here; I got over the fence, and in at the\r\nback door."\r\n\r\n"Did they see you come?" inquired Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say, but I think that they did not; I heard them give a loud\r\nshout more than once when on this side of the wood."\r\n\r\n"You did? How far from here were you when you heard the shouts?"\r\ninquired Mrs. Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"I was close here; and, as I jumped over the fence, I heard them shout\r\nagain; but I think they cannot see so far; the night was moonlight, to\r\nbe sure, but that is all; the shadow of the hedge, and the distance\r\ntogether, would make it, if not impossible, at least very improbable."\r\n\r\n"That is very likely," said Mrs. Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"In that case," said Charles Holland, "you are safe here; for none will\r\nsuspect your being concealed here."\r\n\r\n"It is the last place I should myself have thought of," said Varney;\r\n"and I may say the last place I would knowingly have come to; but had I\r\nbefore known enough of you, I should have been well assured of your\r\ngenerosity, and have freely come to claim your aid and shelter, which\r\naccident has so strangely brought me to be a candidate for, and which you\r\nhave so kindly awarded me."\r\n\r\n"The night is wearing away," said Flora, "and Sir Francis is doubtless\r\nfatigued to an excess; sleep, I dare say, will be most welcome to him."\r\n\r\n"It will indeed, Miss Bannerworth," said Varney; "but I can do that\r\nunder any circumstances; do not let me put you to any inconvenience; a\r\nchair, and at any hour, will serve me for sleep."\r\n\r\n"We cannot do for you what we would wish," said Flora, looking at her\r\nmother; "but something better than that, at all events, we can and will\r\nprovide for you."\r\n\r\n"I know not how to thank you," said Sir Francis Varney; "I assure you,\r\nof late I have not been luxuriously lodged, and the less trouble I give\r\nyou the greater I shall esteem the favour."\r\n\r\nThe hour was late, and Sir Francis Varney, before another half hour had\r\nelapsed, was consigned to his own reflections, in a small but neat room,\r\nthere to repose his bruised and battered carcass, and court the\r\nrefreshing influence of sleep.\r\n\r\nHis reflections were, for nearly an hour, of the most contradictory\r\ncharacter; some one passion was trying to overcome the other; but he\r\nseemed quite subdued.\r\n\r\n"I could not have expected this," he muttered; "Flora Bannerworth has\r\nthe soul of a heroine. I deserved not such a reception from them; and\r\nyet, in my hour of utmost need, they have received me like a favoured\r\nfriend; and yet all their misfortunes have taken their origin from me; I\r\nam the cause of all."\r\n\r\nFilled with these thoughts, he fell asleep; he slept till morning broke.\r\nHe was not disturbed; it seemed as though the influence of sleep was\r\nsweeter far there, in the cottage of the Bannerworths, than ever he had\r\nbefore received.\r\n\r\nIt was late on that morning before Sir Francis rose, and then only\r\nthrough hearing the family about, and, having performed his toilet, so\r\nfar as circumstances permitted, he descended, and entered the\r\nfront-parlour, the room he had been in the night before.\r\n\r\nFlora Bannerworth was already there; indeed, breakfast was waiting the\r\nappearance of Sir Francis Varney.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Miss Bannerworth," said Sir Francis, bowing with his\r\nusual dignified manner, but in the kindest and sincerest way he was able\r\nto assume.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Sir Francis," said Flora, rising to receive him; and she\r\ncould not avoid looking at him as he entered the room. "I hope you have\r\nhad a pleasant night?"\r\n\r\n"It has been the best night\'s rest I have had for some time, Miss\r\nBannerworth. I assure you I have to express my gratitude to you for so\r\nmuch kindness. I have slept well, and soundly."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I think yet I shall escape the search of these people who have hunted\r\nme from so many places."\r\n\r\n"I hope you may, indeed, Sir Francis."\r\n\r\n"You, Miss Bannerworth! and do you hope I may escape the vengeance of\r\nthese people--the populace?"\r\n\r\n"I do, Sir Francis, most sincerely hope so. Why should I wish evil to\r\nyou, especially at their hands?"\r\n\r\nSir Francis did not speak for a minute or two, and then he said, turning\r\nfull upon Flora--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why, Miss Bannerworth, that I should think so, but perhaps\r\nit is because there are peculiar circumstances connected with myself,\r\nthat have made me feel conscious that I have not deserved so much\r\ngoodness at your hands."\r\n\r\n"You have not deserved any evil. Sir Francis, we could not do that if it\r\nwere in our power; we would do you a service at any time."\r\n\r\n"You have done so, Miss Bannerworth--the greatest that can be performed.\r\nYou have saved my life."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Charles Holland entered, and Sir Francis bowed, as he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"I hope you, Mr. Holland, have slept as well, and passed as good a night\r\nas I have passed?"\r\n\r\n"I am glad you, at least, have passed a quiet one," said Charles\r\nHolland; "you, I dare say, feel all the better for it? How do you feel\r\nyourself? Are you much hurt?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, not at all," said Sir Francis Varney. "Only a few bruises,\r\nand so forth, some of which, as you may perceive, do not add to one\'s\r\npersonal appearance. A week or two\'s quiet would rid me of them. At all\r\nevents, I would it may do the same with my enemies."\r\n\r\n"I wish they were as easily gotten rid of myself," said Charles; "but as\r\nthat cannot be, we must endeavour to baffle them in the best way we\r\nmay."\r\n\r\n"I owe a debt to you I shall never be able to repay; but where there is\r\na will, they say there is a way; and if the old saying be good for\r\nanything, I need not despair, though the way is by no means apparent at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"Time is the magician," said Flora, "whose wand changes all things--the\r\nyoung to the aged, and the aged to nothing."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, that is true," said Varney, "and many such changes have I\r\nseen. My mind is stored with such events; but this is sadness, and I\r\nhave cause to rejoice."\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was passed off in pleasing conversation, and Varney found\r\nhimself much at home with the Bannerworths, whose calm and even tenour\r\nwas quite new to him.\r\n\r\nHe could not but admit the charms of such a life as that led by the\r\nBannerworths; but what it must have been when they were supplied by\r\nample means, with nothing to prey upon their minds, and no fearful\r\nmystery to hang on and weigh down their spirits, he could scarcely\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nThey were amiable, accomplished; they were in the same mind at all times,\r\nand nothing seemed to ruffle them; and when night came, he could not but\r\nacknowledge to himself that he had never formed half the opinion of them\r\nthey were deserving of.\r\n\r\nOf course during that day he was compelled to lie close, so as not to be\r\nseen by any one, save the family. He sat in a small room, which was\r\noverlooked by no other in the neighbourhood, and he remained quiet,\r\nsometimes conversing, and sometimes reading, but at the same time ever\r\nattentive to the least sound that appeared at all of a character to\r\nindicate the approach of persons for any purpose whatever.\r\n\r\nAt supper time he spoke to Flora and to Charles Holland, saying,--\r\n\r\n"There are certain matters connected with myself--I may say with you\r\nnow--sure all that has happened will make it so--of which you would be\r\nglad to hear some thing."\r\n\r\n"You mean upon the same subject upon which I had some conversation with\r\nyou a day or two back?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the same. Allow me one week, and you shall know all. I will then\r\nrelate to you that which you so much desire to know--one week, and all\r\nshall be told."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Charles Holland, "this has not been exacted from you as the\r\nprice of your safety, but you can choose your own time, of course; what\r\nyou promise is most desired, for it will render those happy who now are\r\nmuch worse than they were before these occurrences took place."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of all that; grant me but one week, and then you shall be\r\nmade acquainted with all."\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied, Sir Francis," said Flora; "but while here under our\r\nroof, we should never have asked you a question."\r\n\r\n"Of this, Miss Bannerworth, the little I have seen of you assures me you\r\nwould not do so; however, I am the more inclined to make it--I am under\r\nso deep an obligation to you all, that I can never repay it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney retired to rest that night--his promise to the\r\nBannerworths filled his mind with many reflections--the insecurity of\r\nhis own position, and the frail tenure which he even held in the hands\r\nof those whom he had most injured.\r\n\r\nThis produced a series of reflections of a grave and melancholy nature,\r\nand he sat by his window, watching the progress of the clouds, as they\r\nappeared to chase each other over the face of the scene--now casting a\r\nshade over the earth, and then banishing the shadows, and throwing a\r\ngentle light over the earth\'s surface, which was again chased away, and\r\nshadows again fell upon the scene below.\r\n\r\nHow long he had sat there in melancholy musing he knew not; but suddenly\r\nhe was aroused from his dreams by a voice that shook the skies, and\r\ncaused him to start to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!--hurrah!--hurrah!" shouted the mob, which had silently\r\ncollected around the cottage of the Bannerworths.\r\n\r\n"Curses!" muttered Sir Francis, as he again sank in his chair, and\r\nstruck his head with his hand. "I am hunted to death--they will not\r\nleave me until my body has graced a cross-road."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!--down with the vampyre--pull him out!"\r\n\r\nThen came an instant knocking at the doors, and the people on the\r\noutside made so great a din, that it seemed as though they contemplated\r\nknocking the house down at once, without warning the inmates that they\r\nwaited there.\r\n\r\nThere was a cessation for about a minute, when one of the family\r\nhastened to the door, and inquired what was wanted.\r\n\r\n"Varney, the vampyre," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"You must seek him elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"We will search this place before we go further," replied a man.\r\n\r\n"But he is not here."\r\n\r\n"We have reason to believe otherwise. Open the door, and let us in--no\r\none shall be hurt, or one single object in the house; but we must come\r\nin, and search for the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Come to-morrow, then."\r\n\r\n"That will not do," said the voice; "open, or we force our way in\r\nwithout more notice."\r\n\r\nAt the same a tremendous blow was bestowed upon the door, and then much\r\nforce was used to thrust it in. A consultation was suddenly held among\r\nthe inmates, as to what was to be done, but no one could advise, and\r\neach was well aware of the utter impossibility of keeping the mob out.\r\n\r\n"I do not see what is to become of me," said Sir Francis Varney,\r\nsuddenly appearing before them. "You must let them in; there is no\r\nchance of keeping them off, neither can you conceal me. You will have no\r\nplace, save one, that will be sacred from their profanation."\r\n\r\n"And which is that?"\r\n\r\n"Flora\'s own room."\r\n\r\nAll started at the thought that Flora\'s chamber could in any way be\r\nprofaned by any such presence as Sir Francis Varney\'s.\r\n\r\nHowever, the doors below were suddenly burst open, amid loud cries from\r\nthe populace, who rushed in in great numbers, and began to search the\r\nlower rooms, immediately.\r\n\r\n"All is lost!" said Sir Francis Varney, as he dashed away and rushed to\r\nthe chamber of Flora, who, alarmed at the sounds that were now filling\r\nthe house, stood listening to them.\r\n\r\n"Miss Bannerworth--" began Varney.\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is indeed I, Miss Bannerworth; hear me, for one moment."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I am again in peril--in more imminent peril than before; my life is not\r\nworth a minute\'s purchase, unless you save me. You, and you alone, can\r\nnow save me. Oh! Miss Bannerworth, if ever pity touched your heart, save\r\nme from those only whom I now fear. I could meet death in any shape but\r\nthat in which they will inflict it upon me. Hear their execrations\r\nbelow!"\r\n\r\n"Death to the vampyre! death to Varney! burn him! run a stake through\r\nhis body!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"What can I do, Sir Francis?"\r\n\r\n"Admit me to your chamber."\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis, are you aware of what you are saying?"\r\n\r\n"I am well. It is a request which you would justly scorn to reply to,\r\nbut now my life--recollect you have saved me once--my life,--do not now\r\nthrow away the boon you have so kindly bestowed. Save me, Miss\r\nBannerworth."\r\n\r\n"It is not possible. I--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Miss Bannerworth, do you imagine this is a time for ceremony, or\r\nthe observances of polished life! On my honour, you run no risk of\r\ncensure."\r\n\r\n"Where is Varney? Where is the vampyre? He ain\'t far off."\r\n\r\n"Hear--hear them, Miss Bannerworth. They are now at the foot of the\r\nstairs. Not a moment to lose. One minute more, and I am in the hands of\r\na crew that has no mercy."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! upstairs! He\'s not below. Upstairs, neighbours, we shall have\r\nhim yet!"\r\n\r\nThese words sounded on the stairs: half-a-dozen more steps, and Varney\r\nwould be seen. It was a miracle he was not heard begging for his life.\r\n\r\nVarney cast a look of despair at the stairhead and felt for his sword,\r\nbut it was not there, he had lost it. He struck his head with his\r\nclenched hand, and was about to rush upon his foes, when he heard the\r\nlock turn; he looked, and saw the door opened gently, and Flora stood\r\nthere; he passed in, and sank cowering into a chair, at the other end of\r\nthe room, behind some curtains.\r\n\r\nThe door was scarcely shut ere some tried to force it, and then a loud\r\nknocking came at the door.\r\n\r\n"Open! open! we want Varney, the vampyre. Open! or we will burst it\r\nopen."\r\n\r\nFlora did open it, but stood resolutely in the opening, and held up her\r\nhand to impose silence.\r\n\r\n"Are you men, that you can come thus to force yourselves upon the\r\nprivacy of a female? Is there nothing in the town or house, that you\r\nmust intrude in numbers into a private apartment? Is no place sacred\r\nfrom you?"\r\n\r\n"But, ma\'am--miss--we only want Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"And can you find him nowhere but in a female\'s bedroom? Shame on you!\r\nshame on you! Have you no sisters, wives, or mothers, that you act\r\nthus?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s not there, you may be sure of that, Jack," said a gruff voice.\r\n"Let the lady be in quiet; she\'s had quite enough trouble with him to\r\nsicken her of a vampyre. You may be sure that\'s the last place to find\r\nhim in."\r\n\r\nWith this they all turned away, and Flora shut the door and locked it\r\nupon them, and Varney was safe.\r\n\r\n"You have saved me," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Flora. "Speak not; there maybe some one listening."\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney stood in the attitude of one listening most anxiously\r\nto catch some sounds; the moon fell across his face, and gave it a\r\nghastly hue, that, added to his natural paleness and wounds, gave him an\r\nalmost unearthly aspect.\r\n\r\nThe sounds grew more and more distant; the shouts and noise of men\r\ntraversing the apartments subsided, and gradually the place became\r\nrestored to its original silence. The mob, after having searched every\r\nother part of the house, and not finding the object of their search,\r\nthey concluded that he was not there, but must have made his escape\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis most desperate peril of Sir Francis Varney seemed to have more\r\neffect upon him than anything that had occurred during his most strange\r\nand most eventful career.\r\n\r\nWhen he was assured that the riotous mob that had been so intent upon\r\nhis destruction was gone, and that he might emerge from his place of\r\nconcealment, he did so with an appearance of such utter exhaustion that\r\nthe Bannerworth family could not but look upon him as a being who was\r\nnear his end.\r\n\r\nAt any time his countenance, as we long have had occasion to remark, was\r\na strange and unearthly looking one; but when we come to superadd to the\r\nstrangeness of his ordinary appearance the traces of deep mental\r\nemotion, we may well say that Varney\'s appearance was positively of the\r\nmost alarming character.\r\n\r\nWhen he was seated in the ordinary sitting apartment of the\r\nBannerworths, he drew a long sighing breath, and placing his hand upon\r\nhis heart, he said, in a faint tone of voice,--\r\n\r\n"It beats now laboriously, but it will soon cease its pulsations for\r\never."\r\n\r\nThese words sounded absolutely prophetic, there was about them such a\r\nsolemn aspect, and he looked at the same time that he uttered them so\r\nmuch like one whose mortal race was run, and who was now a candidate for\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\n"Do not speak so despairingly," said Charles Holland; "remember, that if\r\nyour life has been one of errors hitherto, how short a space of time may\r\nsuffice to redeem some of them at least, and the communication to me\r\nwhich you have not yet completed may to some extent have such an\r\neffect."\r\n\r\n"No, no. It may contribute to an act of justice, but it can do no good\r\nto me. And yet do not suppose that because such is my impression that I\r\nmean to hesitate in finishing to you that communication."\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear you say so, and if you would, now that you must be\r\naware of what good feelings towards you we are all animated with, remove\r\nthe bar of secrecy from the communication, I should esteem it a great\r\nfavour."\r\n\r\nVarney appeared to be considering for a few moments, and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, well. Let the secrecy no longer exist. Have it removed at once. I\r\nwill no longer seek to maintain it. Tell all, Charles Holland--tell\r\nall."\r\n\r\nThus empowered by the mysterious being, Charles Holland related briefly\r\nwhat Varney had already told him, and then concluded by saying,--\r\n\r\n"That is all that I have myself as yet been made aware of, and I now\r\ncall upon Sir Francis Varney to finish his narration."\r\n\r\n"I am weak," said Varney, "and scarcely equal to the task; but yet I\r\nwill not shrink from the promise that I have made. You have been the\r\npreservers of my life, and more particularly to you, Flora Bannerworth,\r\nam I indebted for an existence, which otherwise must have been\r\nsacrificed upon the altar of superstition."\r\n\r\n"But you will recollect, Master Varney," said the admiral, who had sat\r\nlooking on for some time in silent wonder, "you must recollect, Master\r\nVarney, that the people are, after all, not so much to blame for their\r\nsuperstition, because, whether you are a vampyre or not, and I don\'t\r\npretend to come to a positive opinion now, you took good care to\r\npersuade them you were."\r\n\r\n"I did," said Varney, with a shudder; "but why did I?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know best."\r\n\r\n"It was, then, because I did believe, and do believe, that there is\r\nsomething more than natural about my strangely protracted existence; but\r\nwe will waive that point, and, before my failing strength, for it\r\nappears to me to be failing, completely prevents me from doing so, let\r\nme relate to you the continued particulars of the circumstances that\r\nmade me what I am."\r\n\r\nFlora Bannerworth, although she had heard before from the lips of\r\nCharles Holland the to her dreadful fact, that her father, in addition\r\nto having laid violent hands upon his own life, was a murderer, now that\r\nthat fearful circumstance was related more publicly, felt a greater pang\r\nthan she had done when it was whispered to her in the accents of pure\r\naffection, and softened down by a gentleness of tone, which Charles\r\nHolland\'s natural delicacy would not allow him to use even to her whom\r\nhe loved so well in the presence of others.\r\n\r\nShe let her beautiful face be hidden by her hands, and she wept as she\r\nlistened to the sad detail.\r\n\r\nVarney looked inquiringly in the countenance of Charles Holland,\r\nbecause, having given him leave to make Flora acquainted with the\r\ncircumstance, he was rather surprised at the amount of emotion which it\r\nproduced in her.\r\n\r\nCharles Holland answered the appealing look by saying,--\r\n\r\n"Flora is already aware of the facts, but it naturally affects her much\r\nto hear them now repeated in the presence of others, and those too,\r\ntowards whom she cannot feel--"\r\n\r\nWhat Charles Holland was going to say was abruptly stopped short by the\r\nadmiral, who interposed, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you mean, you son of a sea cook? The presence of who do\r\nyou mean? Do you mean to say that I don\'t feel for Miss Flora, bless her\r\nheart! quite as much as a white-faced looking swab like you? Why, I\r\nshall begin to think you are only fit for a marine."\r\n\r\n"Nay, uncle, now do not put yourself out of temper. You must be well\r\naware that I could not mean anything disrespectful to you. You should\r\nnot suppose such a state of things possible; and although, perhaps, I\r\ndid not express myself so felicitously as I might, yet what I intended\r\nto say, was--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother what you intended to say. You go on, Mr. Vampyre, with your\r\nstory. I want to know what became of it all; just you get on as quick as\r\nyou can, and let us know what you did after the man was murdered."\r\n\r\n"When the dreadful deed was committed," said Varney, "and our victim lay\r\nweltering in his blood, and had breathed his last, we stood like men who\r\nfor the first time were awakened to the frightful consequences of what\r\nthey had done.\r\n\r\n"I saw by the dim light that hovered round us a great change come over\r\nthe countenance of Marmaduke Bannerworth, and he shook in every limb.\r\n\r\n"This soon passed away, however, and the powerful and urgent necessity\r\nwhich arose of avoiding the consequences of the deed that we had done,\r\nrestored us to ourselves. We stooped and took from the body the\r\nill-gotten gains of the gambler. They amounted to an immense sum, and I\r\nsaid to Marmaduke Bannerworth,--\r\n\r\n"\'Take you the whole of this money and proceed to your own home with it,\r\nwhere you will be least suspected. Hide it in some place of great\r\nsecrecy, and to-morrow I will call upon you, when we will divide it, and\r\nwill consider of some means of safely exchanging the notes for gold.\'\r\n\r\n"He agreed to this, and placed the money in his pocket, after which it\r\nbecame necessary that we should dispose of the body, which, if we did\r\nnot quickly remove, must in a few hours be discovered, and so,\r\nperchance, accompanied by other criminating circumstances, become a\r\nfrightful evidence against us, and entail upon us all those consequences\r\nof the deed which we were so truly anxious to escape from.\r\n\r\n"It is ever the worst part of the murderer\'s task, that after he has\r\nstruck the blow that has deprived his victim of existence, it becomes\r\nhis frightful duty to secrete the corpse, which, with its dead eyes,\r\never seems to be glaring upon him such a world of reproach.\r\n\r\n"That it is which should make people pause ere they dipped their hands\r\nin the blood of others, and that it is which becomes the first\r\nretribution that the murderer has to endure for the deep crime that he\r\nhas committed.\r\n\r\n"We tore two stakes from a hedge, and with their assistance we contrived\r\nto dig a very superficial hole, such a hole as was only sufficient, by\r\nplacing a thin coating of earth over it, to conceal the body of the\r\nmurdered man.\r\n\r\n"And then came the loathsome task of dragging him into it--a task full\r\nof horror, and from which we shrunk aghast; but it had to be done, and,\r\ntherefore, we stooped, and grasping the clothes as best we might, we\r\ndragged the body into the chasm we had prepared for its reception. Glad\r\nwere we then to be enabled to throw the earth upon it and to stamp upon\r\nit with such vehemence as might well be supposed to actuate men deeply\r\nanxious to put out of sight some dangerous and loathsome object.\r\n\r\n"When we had completed this, and likewise gathered handsfull of dust\r\nfrom the road, and dry leaves, and such other matter, to sprinkle upon\r\nthe grave, so as to give the earth an appearance of not having been\r\ndisturbed, we looked at each other and breathed from our toil.\r\n\r\n"Then, and not till then, was it that we remembered that among other\r\nthings which the gambler had won of Marmaduke were the deeds belonging\r\nto the Dearbrook property."\r\n\r\n"The Dearbrook property!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth; "I know that\r\nthere was a small estate going by that name, which belonged to our\r\nfamily, but I always understood that long ago my father had parted with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it was mortgaged for a small sum--a sum not a fourth part of its\r\nvalue--and it had been redeemed by Marmaduke Bannerworth, not for the\r\npurpose of keeping it, but in order that he might sell it outright, and\r\nso partially remedy his exhausted finances."\r\n\r\n"I was not aware of that," returned Henry.\r\n\r\n"Doubtless you were not, for of late--I mean for the twelve months or so\r\npreceding your father\'s death--you know he was much estranged from all\r\nthe family, so that you none of you knew much of what he was doing,\r\nexcept that he was carrying on a very wild and reckless career, such as\r\nwas sure to end in dishonour and poverty; but I tell you he had the\r\ntitle deeds of the Dearbrook property, and that they were only got from\r\nhim, along with everything else of value that he possessed, at the\r\ngaming-table, by the man who paid such a fearful penalty for his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n"It was not until after the body was completely buried, and we had\r\ncompleted all our precautions for more effectually hiding it from\r\nobservation, that we recollected the fact of those important papers\r\nbeing in his possession. It was Marmaduke Bannerworth who first\r\nremembered it, and he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"\'By Heaven, we have buried the title deeds of the property, and we\r\nshall have again to exhume the corpse for the purpose of procuring\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n"Now those deeds were nothing to me, and repugnant as I had felt from\r\nthe first to having anything whatever to do with the dead body, it was\r\nnot likely that I would again drag it from the earth for such an object.\r\n\r\n"\'Marmaduke Bannerworth,\' I said, \'you can do what you please, and take\r\nthe consequences of what you do, but I will not again, if I can help it,\r\nlook upon the face of that corpse. It is too fearful a sight to\r\ncontemplate again. You have a large sum of money, and what need you care\r\nnow for the title deeds of a property comparatively insignificant?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, well,\' he said, \'I will not, at the present time, disturb the\r\nremains; I will wait to see if anything should arise from the fact of\r\nthe murder; if it should turn out that no suspicion of any kind is\r\nexcited, but that all is still and quiet, I can then take measures to\r\nexhume the corpse, and recover those papers, which certainly are\r\nimportant.\'\r\n\r\n"By this time the morning was creeping on apace, and we thought it\r\nprudent to leave the spot. We stood at the end of the lane for a few\r\nmoments conversing, and those moments were the last in which I ever saw\r\nMarmaduke Bannerworth."\r\n\r\n"Answer me a question," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"I will; ask me what you please, I will answer it."\r\n\r\n"Was it you that called at Bannerworth Hall, after my father\'s\r\nmelancholy death, and inquired for him?"\r\n\r\n"I did; and when I heard of the deed that he had done, I at once left,\r\nin order to hold counsel with myself as to what I should do to obtain at\r\nleast a portion of the property, one-half of which, it was understood,\r\nwas to have been mine. I heard what had been the last words used by\r\nMarmaduke Bannerworth on the occasion of his death, and they were amply\r\nsufficient to let me know what had been done with the money--at all\r\nevents, so far as regards the bestowal of it in some secret place; and\r\nfrom that moment the idea of, by some means or another, getting the\r\nexclusive possession of it, never forsook my mind.\r\n\r\n"I thought over the matter by day and, by night; and with the exception\r\nof having a knowledge of the actual hiding-place of the money, I could\r\nsee, in the clearest possible manner, how the whole affair had been\r\ntransacted. There can be no doubt but that Marmaduke Bannerworth had\r\nreached home safely with the large sum of which he had become possessed,\r\nand that he had hidden it securely, which was but an ordinary measure of\r\nprecaution, when we come to consider how the property had been obtained.\r\n\r\n"Then I suspect that, being alone, and left to the gloom of his own\r\nmiserable thoughts, they reverted so painfully to the past that he was\r\ncompelled to drink deeply for the purpose of drowning reflection.\r\n\r\n"The natural consequence of this, in his state, was, that partial\r\ninsanity supervened, and at a moment when frenzy rose far above\r\nreflection, he must have committed the dreadful act which hurried him\r\ninstantaneously to eternity."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry; "it must have been so; you have guessed truly. He did\r\non that occasion drink an immense quantity of wine; but instead of\r\nstilling the pangs of remorse it must have increased them, and placed\r\nhim in such a frenzied condition of intellect, that he found it\r\nimpossible to withstand the impulse of it, unless by the terrific act\r\nwhich ended his existence."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and which at once crushed all my expectations of the large fortune\r\nwhich was to have been mine; for even the one-half of the sum which had\r\nbeen taken from the gamester\'s pocket would have been sufficient to have\r\nenabled me to live for the future in affluence.\r\n\r\n"I became perfectly maddened at the idea that so large a sum had passed\r\nout of my hands. I constantly hovered about Bannerworth Hall, hoping and\r\nexpecting that something might arise which would enable me to get\r\nadmittance to it, and make an active search through its recesses for the\r\nhidden treasure.\r\n\r\n"All my exertions were in vain. I could hit upon no scheme whatever; and\r\nat length, wearied and exhausted, I was compelled to proceed to London\r\nfor the sake of a subsistence. It is only in that great metropolis that\r\nsuch persons as myself, destitute of real resources, but infinitely\r\nreckless as regards the means by which they acquire a subsistence, can\r\nhope to do so. Once again, therefore, I plunged into the vortex of\r\nLondon life, and proceeded, heedless of the criminality of what I was\r\nabout, to cater for myself by robbery, or, indeed, in any manner which\r\npresented a prospect of success. It was during this career of mine, that\r\nI became associated with some of the most desperate characters of the\r\ntime; and the offences we committed were of that daring character that\r\nit could not be wondered at eventually so formidable a gang of\r\ndesperadoes must be by force broken up.\r\n\r\n"It so occurred, but unknown to us, that the police resolved upon making\r\none of the most vigorous efforts to put an end to the affair, and in\r\nconsequence a watch was set upon every one of our movements.\r\n\r\n"The result of this was, as might have been expected, our complete\r\ndispersion, and the arrest of some our members, and among them myself.\r\n\r\n"I knew my fate almost from the first. Our depredations had created such\r\na sensation, that the legislature, even, had made it a matter of\r\nimportance that we should be suppressed, and it was an understood thing\r\namong the judges, that the severest penalties of the law should be\r\ninflicted upon any one of the gang who might be apprehended and\r\nconvicted.\r\n\r\n"My trial scarcely occupied an hour, and then I was convicted and\r\nsentenced to execution, with an intimation from the judge that it would\r\nbe perfectly absurd of me to dream, for one moment, of a remission of\r\nthat sentence.\r\n\r\n"In this state of affairs, and seeing nothing but death before me, I\r\ngave myself up to despair, and narrowly missed cheating the hangman of\r\nhis victim.\r\n\r\n"More dead than alive, I was, however, dragged out to be judicially\r\nmurdered, and I shall never forget the crowd of frightful sensations\r\nthat came across my mind upon that terrific occasion.\r\n\r\n"It seemed as if my fate had then reached its climax, and I have really\r\nbut a dim recollection of the terrible scene.\r\n\r\n"I remember something of the confused murmur arising from an immense\r\nthrong of persons. I remember looking about me, and seeing nothing but\r\nwhat appeared to me an immense sea of human heads, and then suddenly I\r\nheard a loud roar of execration burst from the multitude.\r\n\r\n"I shrunk back terrified, and it did, indeed, seem to me a brutal thing\r\nthus to roar and shout at a man who was brought out to die. I soon,\r\nhowever, found that the mob who came to see such a spectacle was not so\r\ndebased as I imagined, but that it was at the hangman, who had suddenly\r\nmade his appearance on the scaffold, at whom they raised that fearful\r\nyell.\r\n\r\n"Some one--I think it was one of the sheriffs--must have noticed that I\r\nwas labouring under the impression that the cry from the mob was\r\nlevelled at me, for he spoke, saying,--\r\n\r\n"\'It is at the hangman they shout,\' and he indicated with his finger\r\nthat public functionary. In my mind\'s eye I think I see him now, and I\r\nam certain that I shall never forget the expression of his face. It was\r\nperfectly fearful; and afterwards, when I learned who and what he was, I\r\nwas not surprised that he should feel so acutely the painfully degrading\r\noffice which he had to perform.\r\n\r\n"The fatal rope was in a few minutes adjusted to my neck. I felt its\r\npressure, and I heard the confused sounds of the monotonous voice of the\r\nclergyman, as he muttered some prayers, that I must confess sounded to\r\nme at the time like a mockery of human suffering.\r\n\r\n"Then suddenly there was a loud shout--I felt the platform give way\r\nbeneath my feet--I tried to utter a yell of agony, but could not--it\r\nseemed to me as if I was encompassed by fire, and then sensation left\r\nme, and I knew no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The next feelings of existence that came over me consisted in a\r\nfrightful tingling sensation throughout my veins, and I felt myself\r\nmaking vain efforts to scream. All the sensations of a person suffering\r\nfrom a severe attack of nightmare came across me, and I was in such an\r\nagony, that I inwardly prayed for death to release me from such a cruel\r\nstate of suffering. Then suddenly the power to utter a sound came to me,\r\nand I made use of it well, for the piercing shriek I uttered, must have\r\nstruck terror into the hearts of all who heard it, since it appalled\r\neven myself.\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose I must have fainted, but when I recovered consciousness\r\nagain, I found myself upon a couch, and a man presenting some stimulus\r\nto me in a cup. I could not distinguish objects distinctly, but I heard\r\nhim say, \'Drink, and you will be better.\'\r\n\r\n"I did drink, for a raging thirst consumed me, and then I fell into a\r\nsound sleep, which, I was afterwards told, lasted nearly twenty-four\r\nhours, and when I recovered from that, I heard again the same voice that\r\nhad before spoken to me, asking me how I was.\r\n\r\n"I turned in the direction of the sound, and, as my vision was now\r\nclearer, I could see that it was the hangman, whose face had made upon\r\nthe scaffold such an impression upon me--an impression which I then\r\nconsidered my last in this world, but which turned out not to be such by\r\nmany a mingled one of pain and pleasure since.\r\n\r\n"It was some time before I could speak, and when I did, it was only in a\r\nfew muttered words, to ask what had happened, and where I was.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you not remember,\' he said, \'that you were hanged?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I do--I do,\' was my reply. \'Is this the region of damned souls?\'\r\n\r\n"\'No; you are still in this world, however strange you may think it.\r\nListen to me, and I will briefly tell you how it is that you have come\r\nback again, as it were, from the very grave, to live and walk about\r\namong the living."\r\n\r\n"I listened to him with a strange and rapt attention, and then he told\r\nhow a young and enthusiastic medical man had been anxious to try some\r\nexperiments with regard to the restoration of persons apparently dead,\r\nand he proceeded to relate how it was that he had given ear to the\r\nsolicitations of the man, and had consented to bring my body after it\r\nwas hung for him to experiment upon. He related how the doctor had been\r\nsuccessful, but how he was so terrified at his own success, that he\r\nhastily fled, and had left London, no one knowing whither he had gone.\r\n\r\n"I listened to this with the most profound attention, and then he\r\nconcluded, by saying to me,--\r\n\r\n"\'There can be no doubt but my duty requires of me to give you up again\r\nto the offended laws of your country. I will not, however, do that, if\r\nyou will consent to an arrangement that I shall propose to you.\'\r\n\r\n"I asked him what the arrangement was, and he said that if I would\r\nsolemnly bind myself to pay to him a certain sum per annum, he would\r\nkeep my secret, and forsaking his calling as hangman, endeavour to do\r\nsomething that should bring with it pleasanter results. I did so\r\nsolemnly promise him, and I have kept my word. By one means or another I\r\nhave succeeded in procuring the required amount, and now he is no more."\r\n\r\n"I believe," cried Henry, "that he has fallen a victim to the blind fury\r\nof the populace."\r\n\r\n"You are right, he has so, and accordingly I am relieved from the burden\r\nof those payments; but it matters little, for now I am so near the tomb\r\nmyself, that, together with all my obligations, I shall soon be beyond\r\nthe reach of mortal cavilling."\r\n\r\n"You need not think so, Varney; you must remember that you are at\r\npresent suffering from circumstances, the pressure of which will soon\r\npass away, and then you will resume your wonted habits."\r\n\r\n"What did you do next?" said the admiral.--"Let\'s know all while you are\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"I remained at the hangman\'s house for some time, until all fear of\r\ndiscovery was over, and then he removed me to a place of greater\r\nsecurity, providing me from his own resources with the means of\r\nexistence, until I had fully recovered my health, and then he told me to\r\nshift for myself.\r\n\r\n"During my confinement though, I had not been idle mentally, for I\r\nconcocted a plan, by which I should be enabled not only to live well\r\nmyself, but to pay to the hangman, whose name was Mortimore, the annual\r\nsum I had agreed upon. I need not go into the details of this plan. Of\r\ncourse it was neither an honest nor respectable one, but it succeeded,\r\nand I soon found myself in a position to enable me thereby to keep my\r\nengagement, as well as to supply me with means of plotting and planning\r\nfor my future fortunes.\r\n\r\n"I had never for a moment forgotten that so large a sum of money was\r\nsomewhere concealed about Bannerworth Hall, and I still looked forward\r\nto obtaining it by some means or another.\r\n\r\n"It was in this juncture of affairs, that one night I was riding on\r\nhorseback through a desolate part of England. The moon was shining\r\nsweetly, as I came to a broad stream of water, across which, about a\r\nmile further on, I saw that there was a bridge, but being unwilling to\r\nwaste time by riding up to it, and fancying, by the lazy ripple of the\r\nwaters, that the river was not shallow, I plunged my horse boldly into\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\n"When we reached its centre, some sudden indisposition must have seized\r\nthe horse, for instead of swimming on well and gallantly as it had done\r\nbefore, it paused for a moment, and then plunged headlong into the\r\ntorrent.\r\n\r\n"I could not swim, and so, for a second time, death, with all its\r\nterrors, appeared to be taking possession of me. The waters rolled over\r\nmy head, gurgling and hissing in my ears, and then all was past. I know\r\nno more, until I found myself lying upon a bright green meadow, and the\r\nfull beams of the moon shining upon me.\r\n\r\n"I was giddy and sick, but I rose, and walked slowly away, each moment\r\ngathering fresh strength, and from that time to this, I never discovered\r\nhow I came to be rescued from the water, and lying upon that green bank.\r\nIt has ever been a mystery to me, and I expect it ever will.\r\n\r\n"Then from that moment the idea that I had a sort of charmed life came\r\nacross me, and I walked about with an impression that such was the case,\r\nuntil I came across a man who said that he was a Hungarian, and who was\r\nfull of strange stories of vampyres. Among other things, he told me that\r\na vampyre could not be drowned, for that the waters would cast him upon\r\nits banks, and, if the moonbeams fell upon him, he would be restored to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"This was precisely my story, and from that moment I believed myself to\r\nbe one of those horrible, but charmed beings, doomed to such a\r\nprotracted existence. The notion grew upon me day by day, and hour by\r\nhour, until it became quite a fixed and strong belief, and I was\r\ndeceiving no one when I played the horrible part that has been\r\nattributed to me."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say that you believe you are a vampyre now?" said\r\nthe admiral.\r\n\r\n"I say nothing, and know not what to think. I am a desperate man, and\r\nwhat there is at all human in me, strange to say, all of you whom I\r\nsought to injure, have awakened."\r\n\r\n"Heed not that," said Henry, "but continue your narrative. We have\r\nforgiven everything, and that ought to suffice to quiet your mind upon\r\nsuch a subject."\r\n\r\n"I will continue; and, believe me, I will conceal nothing from you. I\r\nlook upon the words I am now uttering as a full, candid, and free\r\nconfession; and, therefore, it shall be complete.\r\n\r\n"The idea struck me that if, by taking advantage of my supposed\r\npreternatural gifts, I could drive you from Bannerworth Hall, I should\r\nhave it to myself to hunt through at my leisure, and possibly find the\r\ntreasure. I had heard from Marmaduke Bannerworth some slight allusion to\r\nconcealing the money behind a picture that was in a bed-room called the\r\npanelled chamber. By inquiry, I ascertained that in that bed-room slept\r\nFlora Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"I had resolved, however, at first to try pacific measures, and\r\naccordingly, as you are well aware, I made various proposals to you to\r\npurchase or to rent Bannerworth Hall, the whole of which you rejected;\r\nso that I found myself compelled to adopt the original means that had\r\nsuggested themselves to me, and endeavour to terrify you from the house.\r\n\r\n"By prowling about, I made myself familiar with the grounds, and with\r\nall the plan of the residence, and then one night made my appearance in\r\nFlora\'s chamber by the window."\r\n\r\n"But how do you account," said Charles Holland, "for your extraordinary\r\nlikeness to the portrait?"\r\n\r\n"It is partly natural, for I belong to a collateral branch of the\r\nfamily; and it was previously arranged. I had seen the portrait in\r\nMarmaduke Bannerworth\'s time, and I knew some of its peculiarities and\r\ndress sufficiently well to imitate them. I calculated upon producing a\r\nmuch greater effect by such an imitation; and it appears that I was not\r\nwrong, for I did produce it to the full."\r\n\r\n"You did, indeed," said Henry; "and if you did not bring conviction to\r\nour minds that you were what you represented yourself to be, you at\r\nleast staggered our judgments upon the occasion, and left us in a\r\nposition of great doubt and difficulty."\r\n\r\n"I did; I did all that, I know I did; and, by pursuing that line of\r\nconduct, I, at last, I presume, entirely forced you from the house."\r\n\r\n"That you did."\r\n\r\n"Flora fainted when I entered her chamber; and the moment I looked upon\r\nher sweet countenance my heart smote me for what I was about; but I\r\nsolemnly aver, that my lips never touched her, and that, beyond the\r\nfright, she suffered nothing from Varney, the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"And have you succeeded," said Henry, "in your object now?"\r\n\r\n"No; the treasure has yet to be found. Mortimore, the hangman, followed\r\nme into the house, guessing my intention, and indulging a hope that he\r\nwould succeed in sharing with me its proceeds. But he, as well as\r\nmyself, was foiled, and nothing came of the toilsome and anxious search\r\nbut disappointment and bitterness."\r\n\r\n"Then it is supposed that the money is still concealed?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so; I hope, as well, that it will be discovered by you and\r\nyours; for surely none can have a better right to it than you, who have\r\nsuffered so much on its account."\r\n\r\n"And yet," remarked Henry, "I cannot help thinking it is too securely\r\nhidden from us. The picture has been repeatedly removed from its place,\r\nand produced no results; so that I fear we have little to expect from\r\nany further or more protracted research."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Varney, "that you have everything to expect. The words\r\nof the dying Marmaduke Bannerworth, you may depend, were not spoken in\r\nvain; and I have every reason to believe that, sooner or later, you\r\nmust, without question, become the possessors of that sum."\r\n\r\n"But ought we rightly to hold it?"\r\n\r\n"Who ought more rightly to hold it?" said Varney; "answer me that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a sensible enough idea of your\'s," said the admiral; "and if you\r\nwere twice over a vampyre, I would tell you so. It\'s a very sensible\r\nidea; I should like to know who has more right to it than those who have\r\nhad such a world of trouble about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Henry, "we must not dispute, as yet, about a sum of\r\nmoney that may really never come to hand. For my own part, I have little\r\nto hope for in the matter; but, certainly, nothing shall be spared, on\r\nmy part, to effect such a thorough search of the Hall as shall certainly\r\nbring it to light, if it be in existence."\r\n\r\n"I presume, Sir Francis Varney," said Charles Holland, "that you have\r\nnow completed your narrative?"\r\n\r\n"I have. After events are well known to you. And, now, I have but to lie\r\ndown and die, with the hope of finding that rest and consolation in the\r\ntomb which has been denied me hitherto in this world. My life has been a\r\nstormy one, and full of the results of angry passions. I do hope now,\r\nthat, for the short time I have to live, I shall know something like\r\nserenity, and die in peace."\r\n\r\n"You may depend, Varney, that, as long as you have an asylum with us,"\r\nsaid the admiral--"and that you may have as long as you like,--you may\r\nbe at peace. I consider that you have surrendered at discretion, and,\r\nunder such circumstances, an enemy always deserves honourable treatment,\r\nand always gets it on board such a ship as this."\r\n\r\n"There you go again," said Jack, "calling the house a ship."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you, if I were to call it a bowsprit? Ain\'t I your\r\ncaptain, you lubber, and so, sure to be right, while you are wrong, in\r\nthe natural order of things? But you go and lay down, Master Varney, and\r\nrest yourself, for you seem completely done up."\r\n\r\nVarney did look fearfully exhausted; and, with the assistance of Henry\r\nand Charles, he went into another apartment, and laid down upon a couch,\r\nshowing great symptoms of debility and want of power.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was a calm; Varney\'s stay at the cottage of the Bannerworths\r\nwas productive of a different mood of mind than ever he had possessed\r\nbefore. He looked upon them in a very different manner to what he had\r\nbeen used to. He had, moreover, considerably altered prospects; there\r\ncould not be the same hopes and expectations that he once had. He was an\r\naltered man. He saw in the Bannerworths those who had saved his life,\r\nand who, without doubt, had possessed an opinion, not merely obnoxious\r\nto him, but must have had some fearful misgivings concerning his\r\ncharacter, and that, too, of a nature that usually shuts out all hope of\r\nbeing received into any family.\r\n\r\nBut, in the hour of his need, when his life was in danger, no one else\r\nwould have done what they had done for him, especially when so\r\nrelatively placed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he had been concealed, when to do so was both dangerous and\r\ndifficult; and then it was done by Flora Bannerworth herself.\r\n\r\nTime flew by. The mode of passing time at the cottage was calm and\r\nserene. Varney had seldom witnessed anything like it; but, at the same\r\ntime, he felt more at ease than ever he had; he was charmed with the\r\nsociety of Flora--in fact, with the whole of the little knot of\r\nindividuals who there collected together; from what he saw he was\r\ngratified in their society; and it seemed to alleviate his mental\r\ndisquiet, and the sense he must feel of his own peculiar position. But\r\nVarney became ill. The state of mind and body he had been in for some\r\ntime past might be the cause of it. He had been much harassed, and\r\nhunted from place to place. There was not a moment in which his life was\r\nnot in danger, and he had, moreover, more than one case, received some\r\nbodily injuries, bruises, and contusions of a desperate character; and\r\nyet he would take no notice of them, but allow them to get well again,\r\nas best they could.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis escapes and injuries had made a deep impression upon his mind, and\r\nhad no doubt a corresponding effect upon his body, and Varney became\r\nvery ill.\r\n\r\nFlora Bannerworth did all that could be done for one in his painful\r\nposition, and this greatly added to the depths of thought that\r\noccasionally beset him, and he could scarcely draw one limb after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe walked from room to room in the twilight, at which time he had more\r\nliberty permitted him than at any other, because there was not the same\r\ndanger in his doing so; for, if once seen, there could be no manner of\r\ndoubt but he would have been pursued until he was destroyed, when no\r\nother means of escape were at hand; and Varney himself felt that there\r\ncould be no chance of his again escaping from them, for his physical\r\npowers were fast decaying; he was not, in fact, the same man.\r\n\r\nHe came out into the parlour from the room in which he had been seated\r\nduring the day. Flora and her mother were there, while Charles Holland\r\nand Henry Bannerworth had both at that moment entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Miss Bannerworth," said Sir Francis, bowing to her, and\r\nthen to her mother, Mrs. Bannerworth; "and you, Mr. Holland, I see, have\r\nbeen out enjoying the free breeze that plays over the hot fields. It\r\nmust be refreshing."\r\n\r\n"It is so, sir," said Charles. "I wish we could make you a partaker in\r\nour walks."\r\n\r\n"I wish you could with all my heart," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"Sir Francis," said Flora, "must be a prisoner for some short time\r\nlonger yet."\r\n\r\n"I ought not to consider it in any such light. It is not imprisonment. I\r\nhave taken sanctuary. It is the well spring of life to me," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"I hope it may prove so; but how do you find yourself this evening, Sir\r\nFrancis Varney?"\r\n\r\n"Really, it is difficult to say--I fluctuate. At times, I feel as though\r\nI should drop insensible on the earth, and then I feel better than I\r\nhave done for some time previously."\r\n\r\n"Doctor Chillingworth will be here bye and bye, no doubt; and he must\r\nsee what he can do for you to relieve you of these symptoms," said\r\nFlora.\r\n\r\n"I am much beholden to you--much beholden to you; but I hope to be able\r\nto do without the good doctor\'s aid in this instance, though I must\r\nadmit I may appear ungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Not at all--not at all."\r\n\r\n"Have you heard any news abroad to-day?" inquired Varney.\r\n\r\n"None, Sir Francis--none; there is nothing apparently stirring; and now,\r\ngo out when you would, you would find nothing but what was old, quiet,\r\nand familiar."\r\n\r\n"We cannot wish to look upon anything with mere charms for a mind at\r\nease, than we can see under such circumstances; but I fear there are\r\nsome few old and familiar features that I should find sad havoc in."\r\n\r\n"You would, certainly, for the burnings and razings to the ground of\r\nsome places, have made some dismal appearances; but time may efface\r\nthat, and then the evil may die away, and the future will become the\r\npresent, should we be able to allay popular feeling."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Sir Francis; "but popular prejudices, or justice, or\r\nfeeling, are things not easily assuaged. The people when once aroused go\r\non to commit all kinds of excess, and there is no one point at which\r\nthey will step short of the complete extirpation of some one object or\r\nother that they have taken a fancy to hunt."\r\n\r\n"The hubbub and excitement must subside."\r\n\r\n"The greater the ignorance the more persevering and the more brutal they\r\nare," said Sir Francis; "but I must not complain of what is the\r\nnecessary consequence of their state."\r\n\r\n"It might be otherwise."\r\n\r\n"So it might, and no mischief arise either; but as we cannot divert the\r\nstream, we may as well bend to the force of a current too strong to\r\nresist."\r\n\r\n"The moon is up," said Flora, who wished to turn the conversation from\r\nthat to another topic. "I see it yonder through the trees; it rises red\r\nand large--it is very beautiful--and yet there is not a cloud about to\r\ngive it the colour and appearance it now wears."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," said Sir Francis Varney; "but the reason is the air is\r\nfilled with a light, invisible vapour, that has the effect you perceive.\r\nThere has been much evaporation going on, and now it shows itself in\r\ngiving the moon that peculiar large appearance and deep colour."\r\n\r\n"Ay, I see; it peeps through the trees, the branches of which cut it up\r\ninto various portions. It is singular, and yet beautiful, and yet the\r\nearth below seems dark."\r\n\r\n"It is dark; you would be surprised to find it so if you walked about.\r\nIt will soon be lighter than it is at this present moment."\r\n\r\n"What sounds are those?" inquired Sir Francis Varney, as he listened\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n"Sounds! What sounds?" returned Henry.\r\n\r\n"The sounds of wheels and horses\' feet," said Varney.\r\n\r\n"I cannot even hear them, much less can I tell what they are," said\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n"Then listen. Now they come along the road. Cannot you hear them now?"\r\nsaid Varney.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can," said Charles Holland; "but I really don\'t know what they\r\nare, or what it can matter to us; we don\'t expect any visitors."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said Varney. "I am somewhat apprehensive of the\r\napproach of strange sounds."\r\n\r\n"You are not likely to be disturbed here," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Indeed; I thought so when I had succeeded in getting into the house\r\nnear the town, and so far from believing it was likely I should be\r\ndiscovered, that I sat on the house-top while the mob surrounded it."\r\n\r\n"Did you not hear them coming?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"And yet you did not attempt to escape from them?"\r\n\r\n"No, I could not persuade them I was not there save by my utter silence.\r\nI allowed them to come too close to leave myself time to\r\nescape--besides, I could hardly persuade myself there could be any\r\nnecessity for so doing."\r\n\r\n"It was fortunate it was as it happened afterwards, that you were able\r\nto reach the wood, and get out of it unperceived by the mob."\r\n\r\n"I should have been in an unfortunate condition had I been in their\r\nhands long. A man made of iron would not be able to resist the brutality\r\nof those people."\r\n\r\nAs they were speaking, a gig, with two men, drove up, followed by one on\r\nhorseback. They stopped at the garden-gate, and then tarried to consult\r\nwith each other, as they looked at the house.\r\n\r\n"What can they want, I wonder?" inquired Henry; "I never saw them\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Charles Holland.\r\n\r\n"Do you not know them at all?" inquired Varney.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Flora; "I never saw them, neither can I imagine what is\r\ntheir object in coming here."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see them before?" inquired Henry of his mother, who held\r\nup her hand to look more carefully at the strangers; then, shaking her\r\nhead, she declared she had never seen such persons as those.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," said Charles Holland. "They certainly are not\r\ngentlemen; but here they come; there is some mistake, I daresay--they\r\ndon\'t want to come here."\r\n\r\nAs they spoke, the two strangers got down; after picking up a topcoat\r\nthey had let fall, they turned round, and deliberately put it into the\r\nchaise again; they walked up the path to the door, at which they\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by the old woman, when the two men entered.\r\n\r\n"Does Francis Beauchamp live here?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said the old woman, who was a little deaf, and she put her hand\r\nbehind her ear to catch the sounds more distinctly--"eh?--who did you\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Varney started as the sounds came upon his ear, but he sat\r\nstill an attentive listener.\r\n\r\n"Are there any strangers in the house?" inquired the other officer,\r\nimpatiently. "Who is here?"\r\n\r\n"Strangers!" said the old woman; "you are the only strangers that I have\r\nseen here."\r\n\r\n"Come," said the officer to his companion, "come this way; there are\r\npeople in this parlour. Our business must be an apology for any rudeness\r\nwe may commit."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he stepped by the old woman, and laying his hand upon the\r\nhandle of the door, entered the apartment, at the same time looking\r\ncarefully around the room as if he expected some one.\r\n\r\n"Ladies," said the stranger, with an off-hand politeness that had\r\nsomething repulsive in it, though it was meant to convey a notion that\r\ncivility was intended; "ladies, I beg pardon for intruding, but I am\r\nlooking for a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"You shall hear from me again soon," said Sir Francis, in an almost\r\nimperceptible whisper.\r\n\r\n"What is the object of this intrusion?" demanded Henry Bannerworth,\r\nrising and confronting the stranger. "This is a strange introduction."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not an unusual one," said the stranger, "in these cases--being\r\nunavoidable, at the least."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Charles Holland, "if you cannot explain quickly your\r\nbusiness here, we will proceed to take those measures which will at\r\nleast rid ourselves of your company."\r\n\r\n"Softly, sir. I mean no offence--not the least; but I tell you I do not\r\ncome for any purpose that is at all consonant to my wishes. I am a\r\nBow-street officer in the execution of my duty--excuse me, therefore."\r\n\r\n"Whom do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Francis Beauchamp; and, from the peculiarity of the appearance of this\r\nindividual here, I think I may safely request the pleasure of his\r\ncompany."\r\n\r\nVarney now rose, and the officer made a rush at him, when he saw him do\r\nso, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Surrender in the king\'s name."\r\n\r\nVarney, however, paid no attention to that, but rushed past, throwing\r\nhis chair down to impede the officer, who could not stay himself, but\r\nfell over it, while Varney made a rush towards the window, which he\r\ncleared at one bound, and crossing the road, was lost to sight in a few\r\nseconds, in the trees and hedges on the other side.\r\n\r\n"Accidents will happen," said the officer, as he rose to his feet; "I\r\ndid not think the fellow would have taken the window in that manner; but\r\nwe have him in view, and that will be enough."\r\n\r\n"In heaven\'s name," said Henry, "explain all about this; we cannot\r\nunderstand one word of it--I am at a loss to understand one word of it."\r\n\r\n"We will return and do so presently," said the officer as he dashed out\r\nof the house after the fugitive at a rapid and reckless speed, followed\r\nby his companion.\r\n\r\nThe man who had been left with the chaise, however, was the first in the\r\nchase; seeing an escape from the window, he immediately guessed that he\r\nwas the man wanted, and, but for an accident, he would have met Varney\r\nat the gate, for, as he was getting out in a hurry, his foot became\r\nentangled with the reins, and he fell to the ground, and Varney at the\r\nsame moment stepped over him.\r\n\r\n"Curse his infernal impudence, and d--n these reins!" muttered the man\r\nin a fury at the accident, and the aggravating circumstance of the\r\nfugitive walking over him in such a manner, and so coolly too--it was\r\nvexing.\r\n\r\nThe man, however, quickly released himself, and rushed after Varney\r\nacross the road, and kept on his track for some time. The moon was still\r\nrising, and shed but a gloomy light around. Everything was almost\r\ninvisible until you came close to it. This was the reason why Varney and\r\nhis pursuer met with several severe accidents--fumbles and hard knocks\r\nagainst impediments which the light and the rapid flight they were\r\ntaking did not admit of their avoiding very well.\r\n\r\nThey went on for some time, but it was evident Varney knew the place\r\nbest, and could avoid what the man could not, and that was the trees and\r\nthe natural impediments of the ground, which Varney was acquainted with.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at full speed across a meadow, a hollow would suddenly\r\npresent itself, and to an accustomed eye the moonlight might enable it\r\nto be distinguished at a glance what it was, while to one wholly\r\nunaccustomed to it, the hollow would often look like a hillock by such a\r\nlight. This Varney would clear at a bound, which a less agile and\r\nheavier person would step into, lifting up his leg to meet an\r\nimpediment, when he would find it come down suddenly some six or eight\r\ninches lower than he anticipated, almost dislocating his leg and neck,\r\nand producing a corresponding loss of breath, which was not regained by\r\nthe muttered curse upon such a country where the places were so uneven.\r\n\r\nHaving come to one of these places, which was a little more perceptible\r\nthan the others, he made a desperate jump, but he jumped into the middle\r\nof the hole with such force that he sprained his ankle, besides sinking\r\ninto a small pond that was almost dry, being overgrown with rushes and\r\naquatic plants.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the other officer coming up--"well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, indeed!" said the one who came first; "it\'s anything but well.\r\nD--n all country excursions say I."\r\n\r\n"Why, Bob, you don\'t mean to say as how you are caught in a rat-trap?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you be d----d! I am, ain\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but are you going to stop there, or coming out, eh? You\'ll catch\r\ncold."\r\n\r\n"I have sprained my ankle."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t well, I tell you; here have I a sprained foot, and my wind\r\nbroken for a month at least. Why were you not quicker? If you had been\r\nsharper we should have had the gentleman, I\'ll swear!"\r\n\r\n"I tumbled down over the chair, and he got out of the window, and I come\r\nout of the door."\r\n\r\n"Well, I got entangled in the reins; but I got off after him, only his\r\nlong legs carried him over everything. I tell you what, Wilkinson, if I\r\nwere to be born again, and intended to be a runner, I would bespeak a\r\npair of long legs."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I should be able to get along better. You have no idea of how\r\nhe skimmed along the ground; it was quite beautiful, only it wasn\'t good\r\nto follow it."\r\n\r\n"A regular sky scraper!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, or something of that sort; he looked like a patent flying shadow."\r\n\r\n"Well, get up and lead the way; we\'ll follow you."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you will--when I lead the way back there; for as to going\r\nout yonder, it is quite out of the question. I want supper to-night and\r\nbreakfast to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, what has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Just this much: if you follow any farther, you\'ll get into the woods,\r\nand there you\'ll be, going round and round, like a squirrel in a cage,\r\nwithout being able to get out, and you will there get none of the good\r\nthings included under the head of those meals."\r\n\r\n"I think so too," said the third.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let\'s go back; we needn\'t run, though it might be as well\r\nto do so."\r\n\r\n"It would be anything but well. I don\'t gallop back, depend upon it."\r\n\r\nThe three men now slowly returned from their useless chase, and re-trod\r\nthe way they had passed once in such a hurry that they could hardly\r\nrecognize it.\r\n\r\n"What a dreadful bump I came against that pole standing there," said\r\none.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I came against a hedge-stake, that was placed so as the moon\r\ndidn\'t show any light on it. It came into the pit of my stomach. I never\r\nrecollect such a pain in my life; for all the world like a hot coal\r\nbeing suddenly and forcibly intruded into your stomach."\r\n\r\n"Well, here\'s the road. I must go up to the house where I started him\r\nfrom. I promised them some explanation. I may as well go and give it to\r\nthem at once."\r\n\r\n"Do as you will. I will wait with the horse, else, perhaps, that\r\nBeauchamp will again return and steal him."\r\n\r\nThe officer who had first entered the house now returned to the\r\nBannerworths, saying,\r\n\r\n"I promised you I would give you some explanation as to what you have\r\nwitnessed."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henry; "we have been awaiting your return with some anxiety\r\nand curiosity. What is the meaning of all this? I am, as we are all, in\r\nperfect ignorance of the meaning of what took place."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you. The person whom you have had here, and goes by the\r\nname of Varney, is named Francis Beauchamp."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Are you assured of this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, perfectly assured of it; I have it in my warrant to apprehend him\r\nby either name."\r\n\r\n"What crime had he been guilty of?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you: he has been _hanged_."\r\n\r\n"Hanged!" exclaimed all present.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?" added Henry; "I am at a loss to understand\r\nwhat you can mean by saying he was hanged."\r\n\r\n"What I say is literally true."\r\n\r\n"Pray tell us all about it. We are much interested in the fact; go on,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, then I believe it was for murder that Francis Beauchamp was\r\nhanged--yes, hanged; a common execution, before a multitude of people,\r\ncollected to witness such an exhibition."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth. "And was--but that is\r\nimpossible. A dead man come to life again! You must be amusing yourself\r\nat our expense."\r\n\r\n"Not I," replied the officer. "Here is my warrant; they don\'t make these\r\nout in a joke."\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, he produced the warrant, when it was evident the\r\nofficer spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n"How was this?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you, sir. You see that this Varney was a regular scamp,\r\ngamester, rogue, and murderer. He was hanged, and hung about the usual\r\ntime; he was cut down and the body was given to some one for dissection,\r\nwhen a surgeon, with the hangman, one Montgomery, succeeded in restoring\r\nthe criminal to life."\r\n\r\n"But I always thought they broke the neck when they were hanged; the\r\nweight of the body would alone do that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no, sir," said the officer; "that is one of the common every\r\nday mistakes; they don\'t break the neck once in twenty times."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"No; they die of suffocation only; this man, Beauchamp, was hanged thus,\r\nbut they contrived to restore him, and then he assumed a new name, and\r\nleft London."\r\n\r\n"But how came you to know all this?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it came to us, as many things usually do, in a very extraordinary\r\nmanner, and in a manner that appears most singular and out of the way;\r\nbut such it was.\r\n\r\n"The executioner who was the means of his being restored, or one of\r\nthem, wished to turn him to account, and used to draw a yearly sum of\r\nmoney from him, as hush money, to induce them to keep the secret; else,\r\nthe fact of his having escaped punishment would subject him to a\r\nrepetition of the same punishment; when, of course, a little more care\r\nwould be taken that he did not escape a second time."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, Varney, or rather Beauchamp, was to pay a heavy sum to\r\nthis man to keep him quiet, and to permit him to enjoy the life he had\r\nso strangely become possessed of."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Holland.\r\n\r\n"Well, this man, Montgomery, had always some kind of suspicion that\r\nVarney would murder him."\r\n\r\n"Murder him! and be the means of saving his life; surely he could not be\r\nso bad as that."\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, sir, this hangman drew a heavy sum yearly from him; thus\r\nmaking him only a mine of wealth to himself; this, no doubt, would\r\nrankle in the other\'s heart, to think he should be so beset, and hold\r\nlife upon such terms."\r\n\r\n"I see, now."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and then came the consideration that he did not do it from any\r\ngood motive, merely a selfish one, and he was consequently under no\r\nobligation to him for what he had done; besides, self-preservation might\r\nurge him on, and tell him to do the deed.\r\n\r\n"However that may be, Montgomery dreaded it, and was resolved to punish\r\nthe deed if he could not prevent it. He, therefore, left general orders\r\nwith his wife, whenever he went on a journey to Varney, if he should be\r\ngone beyond a certain time, she was to open a certain drawer, and take\r\nout a sealed packet to the magistrate at the chief office, who would\r\nattend to it.\r\n\r\n"He has been missing, and his wife did as she was desired, and now we\r\nhave found what he there mentioned to be true; but, now, sir, I have\r\nsatisfied you and explained to you why we intruded upon you, we must now\r\nleave and seek for him elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"It is most extraordinary, and that is the reason why his complexion is\r\nso singular."\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\nThey poured out some wine, which was handed to the officers, who drank\r\nand then quitted the house, leaving the inmates in a state of\r\nstupefaction, from surprise and amazement at what they had heard from\r\nthe officers.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange feeling came over them when they recollected the\r\nmany occurrences they had witnessed, and even the explanation of the\r\nofficers; it seemed as if some mist had enveloped objects and rendered\r\nthem indistinct, but which was fast rising, and they were becoming\r\nplainer and more distinct every moment in which they were regarded.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, and Flora was about to speak, when suddenly\r\nthere came the sound of a footstep across the garden. It was slow but\r\nunsteady, and paused between whiles until it came close beneath the\r\nwindows. They remained silent, and then some one was heard to climb up\r\nthe rails of the veranda, and then the curtains were thrust aside, but\r\nnot till after the person outside had paused to ascertain who was there.\r\n\r\nThen the curtains were opened, and the visage of Sir Francis Varney\r\nappeared, much altered; in fact, completely worn and exhausted.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to deny it, but he looked ghastly--terrific; his singular\r\nvisage was as pallid as death; his eyes almost protruding, his mouth\r\nopened, and his breathing short, and laboured in the extreme.\r\n\r\nHe climbed over with much difficulty, and staggered into the room, and\r\nwould have spoken, but he could not; befell senseless upon the floor,\r\nutterly exhausted and motionless.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, and each one present looked at each other, and\r\nthen they gazed upon the inanimate body of Sir Francis Varney, which lay\r\nsupine and senseless in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nThe importance of the document, said to be on the dead body, was such\r\nthat it would admit of no delay before it was obtained, and the party\r\ndetermined that it should be commenced instanter. Lost time would be an\r\nobject to them; too much haste could hardly be made; and now came the\r\nquestion of, "should it be to-night, or not?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Henry Bannerworth; "the sooner we can get it, the\r\nsooner all doubt and distress will be at an end; and, considering the\r\nturn of events, that will be desirable for all our sakes; besides, we\r\nknow not what unlucky accident may happen to deprive us of what is so\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n"There can be none," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but there is this to be\r\nsaid, this has been such an eventful history, that I cannot say what\r\nmight or what might not happen."\r\n\r\n"We may as well go this very night," said Charles Holland. "I give my\r\nvote for an immediate exhumation of the body. The night is somewhat\r\nstormy, but nothing more; the moon is up, and there will be plenty of\r\nlight."\r\n\r\n"And rain," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Little or none," said Charles Holland. "A few gusts of wind now and\r\nthen drive a few heavy plashes of rain against the windows, and that\r\ngives a fearful sound, which is, in fret, nothing, when you have to\r\nencounter it; but you will go, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, most certainly. We must have some tools."\r\n\r\n"Those may be had from the garden," said Henry. "Tools for the\r\nexhumation, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; pickaxe, mattocks, and a crowbar; a lantern, and so forth," said\r\nthe doctor. "You see I am at home in this; the fact is, I have had more\r\nthan one affair of this kind on my hands before now, and whilst a\r\nstudent I have had more than one adventure of a strange character."\r\n\r\n"I dare say, doctor," said Charles Holland, "you have some sad pranks to\r\nanswer for; you don\'t think of it then, only when you find them\r\naccumulated in a heap, so that you shall not be able to escape them;\r\nbecause they come over your senses when you sleep at night."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Chillingworth; "you are mistaken in that. I have long\r\nsince settled all my accounts of that nature; besides, I never took a\r\ndead body out of a grave but in the name of science, and never for my\r\nown profit, seeing I never sold one in my life, or got anything by it."\r\n\r\n"That is not the fact," said Henry; "you know, doctor, you improved your\r\nown talents and knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I did."\r\n\r\n"Well, but you profited by such improvements?"\r\n\r\n"Well, granted, I did. How much more did the public not benefit then,"\r\nsaid the doctor, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, we won\'t argue the question," said Charles; "only it strikes\r\nme that the doctor could never have been a doctor if he had not\r\ndetermined upon following a profession."\r\n\r\n"There may be a little truth in that," said Chillingworth; "but now we\r\nhad better quit the house, and make the best of our way to the spot\r\nwhere the unfortunate man lies buried in his unhallowed grave."\r\n\r\n"Come with me into the garden," said Henry Bannerworth; "we shall there\r\nbe able to suit ourselves to what is required. I have a couple of\r\nlanterns."\r\n\r\n"One is enough," said Chillingworth; "we had better not burden ourselves\r\nmore than we are obliged to do; and we shall find enough to do with the\r\ntools."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are not light; and the distance is by far too great to make\r\nwalking agreeable and easy; the wind blows strong, and the rain appears\r\nto be coming up afresh, and, by the time we have done, we shall find the\r\nground will become slippy, and bad for walking."\r\n\r\n"Can we have a conveyance?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the doctor; "we could, but we must trouble the turnpike\r\nman; besides, there is a shorter way across some fields, which will be\r\nbetter and safer."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Charles Holland; "I do not mind which way it is, as\r\nlong as you are satisfied yourselves. The horse and cart would have\r\nsettled it all better, and done it quicker, besides carrying the tools."\r\n\r\n"Very true, very true," said the doctor; "all that is not without its\r\nweight, and you shall choose which way you would have it done; for my\r\npart, I am persuaded the expedition on foot is to be preferred for two\r\nreasons."\r\n\r\n"And what are they?"\r\n\r\n"The first is, we cannot obtain a horse and cart without giving some\r\ndetail as to what you want it for, which is awkward, on account of the\r\nhour. Moreover, you could not get one at this moment in time."\r\n\r\n"That ought to settle the argument," said Henry Bannerworth; "an\r\nimpossibility, under the circumstances, at once is a clincher, and one\r\nthat may be allowed to have some weight."\r\n\r\n"You may say that," said Charles.\r\n\r\n"Besides which, you must go a greater distance, and that, too, along the\r\nmain road, which is objectionable."\r\n\r\n"Then we are agreed," said Charles Holland, "and the sooner we are off\r\nthe better; the night grows more and more gloomy every hour, and more\r\ninclement."\r\n\r\n"It will serve our purpose the better," said Chillingworth. "What we do,\r\nwe may as well do now."\r\n\r\n"Come with me to the garden," said Henry, "and we will take the tools.\r\nWe can go out the back way; that will preclude any observation being\r\nmade."\r\n\r\nThey all now left the apartment, wrapped up in great overcoats, to\r\nsecure themselves against the weather, and also for the purpose of\r\nconcealing themselves from any chance passenger.\r\n\r\nIn the garden they found the tools they required, and having chosen\r\nthem, they took a lantern, with the mean of getting a light when they\r\ngot to their journey\'s end, which they would do in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nAfter having duly inspected the state of their efficiency, they started\r\naway on their expedition.\r\n\r\nThe night had turned gloomy and windy; heavy driving masses of clouds\r\nobscured the moon, which only now and then was to be seen, when the\r\nclouds permitted her to peep out. At the same time, there were many\r\ndrifting showers, which lasted but a few minutes, and then the clouds\r\nwere carried forwards by some sudden gust of wind so that, altogether,\r\nit was a most uncomfortable night as well could be imagined.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no time to lose, and, under all circumstances, they\r\ncould not have chosen a better night for their purpose than the one they\r\nhad; indeed, they could not desire another night to be out on such a\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThey spoke not while they were within sight of the houses, though at the\r\ndistance of many yards, and, at the same time, there was a noise through\r\nthe trees that would have carried their voices past every object,\r\nhowever close; but they would make assurance doubly sure.\r\n\r\n"I think we are fairly away now," said Henry, "from all fear of being\r\nrecognized."\r\n\r\n"To be sure you are. Who would recognize us now, if we were met?"\r\n\r\n"No one."\r\n\r\n"I should think not; and, moreover, there would be but small chance of\r\nany evil coming from it, even if it were to happen that we were to be\r\nseen and known. Nobody knows what we are going to do, and, if they did,\r\nthere is no illegality in the question."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; but we wish the matter to be quite secret, therefore, we\r\ndon\'t wish to be seen by any one while upon this adventure."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Chillingworth; "and, if you\'ll follow my guidance, you\r\nshall meet nobody."\r\n\r\n"We will trust you, most worthy doctor. What have you to say for our\r\nconfidence?"\r\n\r\n"That you will find it is not misplaced."\r\n\r\nJust as the doctor had uttered the last sound, there came a hearty laugh\r\nupon the air, which, indeed, sounded but a few paces in advance of them.\r\nThe wind blew towards them, and would, therefore, cause the sounds to\r\ncome to them, but not to go away in the direction they were going.\r\n\r\nThe whole party came to a sudden stand still; there was something so\r\nstrange in hearing a laugh at that moment, especially as Chillingworth\r\nwas, at that moment, boasting of his knowledge of the ground and the\r\ncertainty of their meeting no one.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" inquired Henry.\r\n\r\n"Some one laughing, I think," said Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Of that there can be little or no doubt," said Charles Holland; "and,\r\nas people do not usually laugh by themselves so heartily, it may be\r\npresumed there are, at least, two."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it."\r\n\r\n"And, moreover, their purpose cannot be a very good one, at this hour of\r\nthe night, and of such a night, too. I think we had better be cautious."\r\n\r\n"Hush! Follow me silently," said Henry.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he moved cautiously from the spot where he stood, and, at\r\nthe same time, he was followed by the whole party, until they came to\r\nthe hedge which skirted a lane, in which were seated three men.\r\n\r\nThey had a sort of tent erected, and that was hung upon a part of the\r\nhedge which was to windward of them, so that it sheltered them from wind\r\nand rain.\r\n\r\nHenry and Chillingworth both peeped over the bank, and saw them seated\r\nbeneath this kind of canopy. They were shabby, gipsy-looking men, who\r\nmight be something else--sheep-stealers, or horse-stealers, in fact,\r\nanything, even to beggars.\r\n\r\n"I say, Jack," said one; "it\'s no bottle to-night."\r\n\r\n"No; there\'s nobody about these parts to-night. We are safe, and so are\r\nthey."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"Besides, you see, those who do happen to be out are not worth talking\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"No cash."\r\n\r\n"None, not enough to pay turnpike for a walking-slick, at the most."\r\n\r\n"Besides, it does us no good to take a few shillings from a poor wretch,\r\nwho has more in family than he has shillings in pocket."\r\n\r\n"Ay, you are right, quite right. I don\'t like it myself, I don\'t;\r\nbesides that, there\'s fresh risk in every man you stop, and these poor\r\nfellows will fight hard for a few shillings, and there is no knowing\r\nwhat an unlucky blow may do for a man."\r\n\r\n"That is very true. Has anything been done to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said one.\r\n\r\n"Only three half crowns," said the other; "that is the extent of the\r\ncommon purse to-night."\r\n\r\n"And I," said the third, "I have got a bottle of bad gin from the Cat\r\nand Cabbage-stump."\r\n\r\n"How did you manage it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, this way. I went in, and had some beer, and you know I can give a\r\nlong yarn when I want; but it wants only a little care to deceive these\r\nknowing countrymen, so I talked and talked, until they got quite chatty,\r\nand then I put the gin in my pocket."\r\n\r\n"Good."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, the loaf and beef I took out of the safe as I came by, and\r\nI dare say they know they have lost it by this time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so do we. I expect the gin will help to digest the beef, so we\r\nmustn\'t complain of the goods."\r\n\r\n"No; give us another glass, Jim."\r\n\r\nJim held the glass towards him, when the doctor, animated by the spirit\r\nof mischief, took a good sized pebble, and threw it into the glass,\r\nsmashing it, and spilling the contents.\r\n\r\nIn a moment there was a change of scene; the men were all terrified, and\r\nstarted to their feet, while a sudden gust of wind caused their light to\r\ngo out; at the same time their tent-cloth was thrown down by the wind,\r\nand fell across their heads.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThere was no need of saying so, for in a moment the three were as if\r\nanimated by one spirit, and away they scudded across the fields, with\r\nthe speed of a race horse.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they were better than half a mile away from the spot.\r\n\r\n"In absence of all authentic information," said the doctor, speaking as\r\nwell as he could, and blowing prodigiously between each word, as though\r\nhe were fetching breath all the way from his heels, "I think we may\r\nconclude we are safe from them. We ought to thank our stars we came\r\nacross them in the way we did."\r\n\r\n"But, doctor, what in the name of Heaven induced you to make such a\r\nnoise, to frighten them, in fact, and to tell them some one was about?"\r\n\r\n"They were too much terrified to tell whether it was one, or fifty. By\r\nthis time they are out of the county; they knew what they were talking\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps we may meet them on the road where we are going, thinking\r\nit a rare lonely spot where they can hide, and no chance of their being\r\nfound out."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"No," said the doctor; "they will not go to such a place; it has by far\r\ntoo bad a name for even such men as those to go near, much less stop\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly think that," said Charles Holland, "for these fellows are\r\ntoo terrified for their personal safety, to think of the superstitious\r\nfears with which a place may be regarded; and these men, in such a place\r\nas the one you speak of, they will be at home."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, rather than be done, we must fight for it; and when you\r\ncome to consider we have one pick and two shovels, we shall be in full\r\nforce."\r\n\r\n"Well said, doctor; how far have we to go?"\r\n\r\n"Not more than a quarter of a mile."\r\n\r\nThey pursued their way through the fields, and under the hedge-rows,\r\nuntil they came to a gate, where they stopped awhile, and began to\r\nconsult and to listen.\r\n\r\n"A few yards up here, on the left," said the doctor; "I know the spot;\r\nbesides, there is a particular mark. Now, then, are you all ready?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, all."\r\n\r\n"Here," said the doctor, pointing out the marks by which the spot might\r\nbe recognized; "here is the spot, and I think we shall not be half a\r\nfoot out of our reckoning."\r\n\r\n"Then let us begin instanter," said Henry, as he seized hold of the\r\npickaxe, and began to loosen the earth by means of the sharp end.\r\n\r\n"That will do for the present," said Chillingworth; "now let me and\r\nCharles take a turn with our shovels, and you will get on again\r\npresently. Throw the earth up on the bank in one heap, so that we can\r\nput it on again without attracting any attention to the spot by its\r\nbeing left in clods and uneven."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Henry, "else the body will be discovered."\r\n\r\nThey began to shovel away, and continued to do so, after it had been\r\npicked up, working alternately, until at length Charles stuck his\r\npick-axe into something soft, and upon pulling it up, he found it was\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nA dreadful odour now arose from the spot, and they were at no loss to\r\ntell where the body lay. The pick-axe had stuck into the deceased\'s ribs\r\nand clothing, and thus lifted it out of its place.\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said the doctor; "but I needn\'t tell you that; the\r\ncharnel-house smell is enough to convince you of the fact of where it\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"I think so; just show a light upon the subject, doctor, and then we can\r\nsee what we are about--do you mind, doctor--you have the management of\r\nthe lantern, you know?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Chillingworth; "I see you have it--don\'t be in a hurry,\r\nbut do things deliberately and coolly whatever you do--you will not be\r\nso liable to make mistakes, or to leave anything undone."\r\n\r\n"There will be nothing of any use to you here, doctor, in the way of\r\ndissection, for the flesh is one mass of decay. What a horrible sight,\r\nto be sure!"\r\n\r\n"It is; but hasten the search."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must; though, to confess the truth, I\'d sooner handle anything\r\nthan this."\r\n\r\n"It is not the most pleasant thing in the world, for there is no knowing\r\nwhat may be the result--what creeping thing has made a home of it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention anything about it."\r\n\r\nHenry and Charles Holland now began to search the pockets of the clothes\r\nof the dead body, in one of which was something hard, that felt like a\r\nparcel.\r\n\r\n"What have you got there?" said Chillingworth, as he held his lantern up\r\nso that the light fell upon the ghastly object that they were handling.\r\n\r\n"I think it is the prize," said Charles Holland; "but we have not got it\r\nout yet, though I dare say it won\'t be long first, if this wind will but\r\nhold good for about five minutes, and keep the stench down."\r\n\r\nThey now tore open the packet and pulled out the papers, which appeared\r\nto have been secreted upon his person.\r\n\r\n"Be sure there are none on any other part of the body," said\r\nChillingworth, "because what you do now, you had better do well, and\r\nleave nothing to after thought, because it is frequently impracticable."\r\n\r\n"The advice is good," said Henry, who made a second search, but found\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n"We had better re-bury him," said the doctor; "it had better be done\r\ncleanly. Well, it is a sad hole for a last resting-place, and yet I do\r\nnot know that it matters--it is all a matter of taste--the fashion of\r\nthe class, or the particular custom of the country."\r\n\r\nThere was but little to be said against such an argument, though the\r\ncustom of the age had caused them to look upon it more as a matter of\r\nfeeling than in such a philosophical sense as that in which the doctor\r\nhad put it.\r\n\r\n"Well, there he is now--shovel the earth in, Charles," said Henry\r\nBannerworth, as he himself set the example, which was speedily and\r\nvigorously followed by Charles Holland, when they were not long before\r\nthe earth was thrown in and covered up with care, and trodden down so\r\nthat it should not appear to be moved.\r\n\r\n"This will do, I think," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is not quite the same, but I dare say no one will try to make\r\nany discoveries in this place; besides, if the rain continues to come\r\ndown very heavy, why, it will wash much of it away, and it will make it\r\nlook all alike."\r\n\r\nThere was little inducement to hover about the spot, but Henry could not\r\nforbear holding up the papers to the light of the lantern to ascertain\r\nwhat they were.\r\n\r\n"Are they all right?" inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Henry, "yes. The Dearbrook estate. Oh! yes; they are the\r\npapers I am in want of."\r\n\r\n"It is singularly fortunate, at least, to be successful in securing\r\nthem. I am very glad a living person has possession of them, else it\r\nwould have been very difficult to have obtained it from them."\r\n\r\n"So it would; but now homeward is the word, doctor; and on my word there\r\nis reason to be glad, for the rain is coming on very fast now, and there\r\nis no moon at all--we had better step out."\r\n\r\nThey did, for the three walked as fast as the nature of the soil would\r\npermit them, and the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nTELLS WHAT BECAME OF THE SECOND VAMPYRE WHO SOUGHT VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe left the Hungarian nobleman swimming down the stream; he swam slowly,\r\nand used but little exertion in doing so. He appeared to use his hands\r\nonly as a means of assistance.\r\n\r\nThe stream carried him onwards, and he aided himself so far that he kept\r\nthe middle of the stream, and floated along.\r\n\r\nWhere the stream was broad and shallow, it sometimes left him a moment\r\nor two, without being strong enough to carry him onwards; then he would\r\npause, as if gaining strength, and finally he would, when he had rested,\r\nand the water came a little faster, and lifted him, make a desperate\r\nplunge, and swim forward, until he again came in deep water, and then he\r\nwent slowly along with the stream, as he supported himself.\r\n\r\nIt was strange thus to see a man going down slowly, and without any\r\neffort whatever, passing through shade and through moonlight--now lost\r\nin the shadow of the tall trees, and now emerging into that part of the\r\nstream which ran through meadows and cornfields, until the stream\r\nwidened, and then, at length, a ferry-house was to be seen in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThen came the ferryman out of his hut, to look upon the beautiful\r\nmoonlight scene. It was cold, but pure, and brilliantly light. The\r\nchaste moon was sailing through the heavens, and the stars diminished in\r\ntheir lustre by the power of the luminous goddess of night.\r\n\r\nThere was a small cottage--true, it was somewhat larger than was\r\ngenerally supposed by any casual observer who might look at it. The\r\nplace was rambling, and built chiefly of wood; but in it lived the\r\nferryman, his wife, and family; among these was a young girl about\r\nseventeen years of age, but, at the same time, very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThey had been preparing their supper, and the ferryman himself walked\r\nout to look at the river and the shadows of the tall trees that stood on\r\nthe hill opposite.\r\n\r\nWhile thus employed, he heard a plashing in the water, and on turning\r\ntowards the quarter whence the sound proceeded for a few yards, he came\r\nto the spot where he saw the stranger struggling in the stream.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" he muttered to himself, as he saw the struggle continued;\r\n"good God! he will sink and drown."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he jumped into his boat and pushed it off, for the purpose\r\nof stopping the descent of the body down the stream, and in a moment or\r\ntwo it came near to him. He muttered,--\r\n\r\n"Come, come--he tries to swim; life is not gone yet--he will do now, if\r\nI can catch hold of him. Swimming with one\'s face under the stream\r\ndoesn\'t say much for his skill, though it may account for the fact that\r\nhe don\'t cry out."\r\n\r\nAs the drowning man neared, the ferryman held on by the boat-hook, and\r\nstooping down, he seized the drowning man by the hair of the head, and\r\nthen paused.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, he lifted him up, and placed him across the edge of the\r\nboat, and then, with some struggling of his own, he was rolled over into\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n"You are safe now," muttered the ferryman.\r\n\r\nThe stranger spoke not, but sat or leaned against the boat\'s head,\r\nsobbing and catching at his breath, and spitting off his stomach the\r\nwater it might be presumed he had swallowed.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman put back to the shore, when he paused, and secured his\r\nboat, and then pulled the stranger out, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Do you feel any better now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the stranger; "I feel I am living--thanks to you, my good\r\nfriend; I owe you my life."\r\n\r\n"You are welcome to that," replied the ferryman; "it costs me nothing;\r\nand, as for my little trouble, I should be sorry to think of that, when\r\na fellow-being\'s life was in danger."\r\n\r\n"You have behaved very well--very well, and I can do little more now\r\nthan thank you, for I have been robbed of all I possessed about me at\r\nthe moment."\r\n\r\n"Oh! you have been robbed?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, truly, I have, and have been thrown into the water, and thus I\r\nhave been nearly murdered."\r\n\r\n"It is lucky you escaped from them without further injury," said the\r\nferryman; "but come in doors, you must be mad to stand here in the\r\ncold."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; your hospitality is great, and, at this moment, of the\r\ngreatest importance to me."\r\n\r\n"Such as we have," said the honest ferryman, "you shall be welcome to.\r\nCome in--come in."\r\n\r\nHe turned round and led the way to the house, which he entered,\r\nsaying--as he opened the small door that led into the main apartment,\r\nwhere all the family were assembled, waiting for the almost only meal\r\nthey had had that day, for the ferryman had not the means, before the\r\nsun had set, of sending for food, and then it was a long way before it\r\ncould be found, and then it was late before they could get it,--\r\n\r\n"Wife, we have a stranger to sleep with us to-night, and for whom we\r\nmust prepare a bed."\r\n\r\n"A stranger!" echoed the wife--"a stranger, and we so poor!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; one whose life I have saved, and who was nearly drowned. We cannot\r\nrefuse hospitality upon such an occasion as that, you know, wife."\r\n\r\nThe wife looked at the stranger as he entered the room, and sat down by\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," he said, "to intrude upon you; but I will make you amends\r\nfor the interruption and inconvenience I may cause you; but it is too\r\nlate to apply elsewhere, and yet I am doubtful, if there were, whether I\r\ncould go any further."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the ferryman; "I am sure a man who has been beaten and\r\nrobbed, and thrown into a rapid and, in some parts, deep stream, is not\r\nfit to travel at this time of night."\r\n\r\n"You are lonely about here," said the stranger, as he shivered by the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n"Yes, rather; but we are used to it."\r\n\r\n"You have a family, too; that must help to lighten the hours away, and\r\nhelp you over the long evenings."\r\n\r\n"So you may think, stranger, and, at times, so it is; but when food runs\r\nshort, it is a long while to daylight, before any more money can be had.\r\nTo be sure, we have fish in the river, and we have what we can grow in\r\nthe garden; but these are not all the wants that we feel, and those\r\nothers are sometimes pinching. However, we are thankful for what we\r\nhave, and complain but little when we can get no more; but sometimes we\r\ndo repine--though I cannot say we ought--but I am merely relating the\r\nfact, whether it be right or wrong."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. How old is your daughter?"\r\n\r\n"She is seventeen come Allhallow\'s eve."\r\n\r\n"That is not far hence," said the stranger. "I hope I may be in this\r\npart of the country--and I think I shall--I will on that eve pay you a\r\nvisit; not one on which I shall be a burden to you, but one more useful\r\nto you, and more consonant to my character."\r\n\r\n"The future will tell us all about that," said the ferryman; "at present\r\nwe will see what we can do, without complaining, or taxing anybody."\r\n\r\nThe stranger and the ferryman sat conversing for some time before the\r\nfire, and then the latter pointed out to him which was his bed--one made\r\nup near the fire, for the sake of its warmth; and then the ferryman\r\nretired to the next room, a place which was merely divided by an\r\nimperfect partition.\r\n\r\nHowever, they all fell soundly asleep. The hours on that day had been\r\nlonger than usual; there was not that buoyancy of spirit; when they\r\nretired, they fell off into a heavy, deep slumber.\r\n\r\nFrom this they were suddenly aroused by loud cries and piercing screams\r\nfrom one of the family.\r\n\r\nSo loud and shrill were the cries, that they all started up, terrified\r\nand bewildered beyond measure, unable to apply their faculties to any\r\none object.\r\n\r\n"Help--help, father!--help!" shrieked the voice of the young girl whom\r\nwe have before noticed.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman jumped up, and rushed to the spot where his daughter lay.\r\n\r\n"Fanny," he said--"Fanny, what ails thee--what ails thee? Tell me, my\r\ndear child."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she exclaimed, almost choked--"oh, father! are we all alone? I am\r\nterrified."\r\n\r\n"What ails thee--what ails thee? Tell me what caused you to scream out\r\nin such a manner?"\r\n\r\n"I--I--that is I, father, thought--but no, I am sure it was reality.\r\nWhere is the stranger?"\r\n\r\n"A light--a light!" shouted the fisherman.\r\n\r\nIn another moment a light was brought him, and he discovered the\r\nstranger reclining in his bed, but awake, and looking around him, as if\r\nin the utmost amazement.\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" he said--"what has happened?"\r\n\r\n"That is more than I know as yet," the man replied. "Come, Fanny," he\r\nadded, "tell me what it is you fear. What caused you to scream out in\r\nthat dreadful manner?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, father--the vampyre!"\r\n\r\n"Great God! what do you mean, Fanny, by that?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know, father. I was fast asleep, when I thought I felt\r\nsomething at my throat; but being very sound asleep, I did not\r\nimmediately awake. Presently I felt the sharp pang of teeth being driven\r\ninto the flesh of my neck--I awoke, and found the vampyre at his repast.\r\nOh, God! oh, God! what shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"Stay, my child, let us examine the wound," said the fisherman, and he\r\nheld the candle to the spot where the vampyre\'s teeth had been applied.\r\nThere, sure enough, were teeth marks, such as a human being\'s would make\r\nwere they applied, but no blood had been drawn therefrom.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Fanny; so far, by divine Providence, you are not injured;\r\nanother moment, and the mischief would have been done entire and\r\ncomplete, and you would have been his victim."\r\n\r\nThen turning to the stranger, he said,--\r\n\r\n"You have had some hand in this. No human being but you could come into\r\nthis place. The cottage door is secured. You must be the vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; who else could?"\r\n\r\n"I!--As Heaven\'s my judge--but there, it\'s useless to speak of it; I\r\nhave not been out of my bed. In this place, dark as it is, and less used\r\nto darkness than you, I could not even find my way about.--It is\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"Get out of your bed, and let me feel," said the ferryman,\r\nperemptorily--"get out, and I will soon tell."\r\n\r\nThe stranger arose, and began to dress himself, and the ferryman\r\nimmediately felt the bed on which he had been lying; but it was ice\r\ncold--so cold that he started upon his legs in an instant, exclaiming\r\nwith vehemence,--\r\n\r\n"It is you, vile wretch! that has attempted to steal into the cottage of\r\nthe poor man, and then to rob him of his only child, and that child of\r\nher heart\'s blood, base ingrate!"\r\n\r\n"My friend, you are wrong, entirely wrong. I am not the creature you\r\nbelieve me. I have slept, and slept soundly, and awoke not until your\r\ndaughter screamed."\r\n\r\n"Scoundrel!--liar!--base wretch! you shall not remain alive to injure\r\nthose who have but one life to lose."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the ferryman made a desperate rush at the vampyre, and\r\nseized him by the throat, and a violent struggle ensued, in which the\r\nsuperior strength of the ferryman prevailed, and he brought his\r\nantagonist to the earth, at the same time bestowing upon him some\r\ndesperate blows.\r\n\r\n"Thou shall go to the same element from which I took thee," said the\r\nferryman, "and there swim or sink as thou wilt until some one shall drag\r\nthee ashore, and when they do, may they have a better return than I."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he dragged along the stranger by main force until they came\r\nto the bank of the river, and then pausing, to observe the deepest part,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n"Here, then, you shall go."\r\n\r\nThe vampyre struggled, and endeavoured to speak, but he could not; the\r\ngrasp at his throat prevented all attempts at speech; and then, with a\r\nsudden exertion of his strength, the ferryman lifted the stranger up,\r\nand heaved him some distance into the river.\r\n\r\nThen in deep water sank the body.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman watched for some moments, and farther down the stream he\r\nsaw the body again rise upon the current and struggling slightly, as for\r\nlife--now whirled around and around, and then carried forward with the\r\nutmost velocity.\r\n\r\nThis continued as far as the moonlight enabled the ferryman to see, and\r\nthen, with a slow step and clouded brow, he returned to his cottage,\r\nwhich he entered, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\n\r\nDR. CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL.--THE ENCOUNTER OF MYSTERY.--THE\r\nCONFLICT.--THE RESCUE, AND THE PICTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere have been many events that have passed rapidly in this our\r\nnarrative; but more have yet to come before we can arrive at that point\r\nwhich will clear up much that appears to be most mysterious and\r\nunaccountable.\r\n\r\nDoctor Chillingworth, but ill satisfied with the events that had yet\r\ntaken place, determined once more upon visiting the Hall, and there to\r\nattempt a discovery of something respecting the mysterious apartment in\r\nwhich so much has already taken place.\r\n\r\nHe communicated his design to no one; he resolved to prosecute the\r\ninquiry alone. He determined to go there and await whatever might turn\r\nup in the shape of events. He would not for once take any companion;\r\nsuch adventures were often best prosecuted alone--they were most easily\r\nbrought to something like an explanatory position, one person can often\r\nconsider matters more coolly than more. At all events, there is more\r\nsecrecy than under any other circumstances.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this often is of greater consequence than many others; and,\r\nmoreover, when there is more than one, something is usually overdone.\r\nWhere one adventurous individual will rather draw back in a pursuit,\r\nmore than one would induce them to urge each other on.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one in such a case could act the part of a spy--a secret\r\nobserver; and in that case can catch people at times when they could not\r\nunder any other circumstances be caught or observed at all.\r\n\r\n"I will go," he muttered; "and should I be compelled to run away again,\r\nwhy, nobody knows anything about it and nobody will laugh at me."\r\n\r\nThis was all very well; but Mr. Chillingworth was not the man to run\r\naway without sufficient cause. But there was so much mystery in all this\r\nthat he felt much interested in the issue of the affair. But this issue\r\nhe could not command; at the same time he was determined to sit and\r\nwatch, and thus become certain that either something or nothing was to\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nEven the knowledge of that much--that some inexplicable action was still\r\ngoing on--was far preferable to the uncertainty of not knowing whether\r\nwhat had once been going on was still so or not, because, if it had\r\nceased, it was probable that nothing more would ever be known concerning\r\nit, and the mystery would still be a mystery to the end of time.\r\n\r\n"It shall be fathomed if there be any possibility of its being\r\ndiscovered," muttered Chillingworth. "Who would have thought that so\r\nquiet and orderly a spot as this, our quiet village, would have suffered\r\nso much commotion and disturbance? Far from every cause of noise and\r\nstrife, it is quite as great a matter of mystery as the vampyre business\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n"I have been so mixed up in this business that I must go through with\r\nit. By the way, of the mysteries, the greatest that I have met with is\r\nthe fact of the vampyre having anything to do with so quiet a family as\r\nthe Bannerworths."\r\n\r\nMr. Chillingworth pondered over the thought; but yet he could make\r\nnothing of it. It in no way tended to elucidate anything connected with\r\nthe affair, and it was much too strange and singular in all its parts to\r\nbe submitted to any process of thought, with any hope of coming to\r\nanything like a conclusion upon the subject--that must remain until some\r\nfacts were ascertained, and to obtain them Mr. Chillingworth now\r\ndetermined to try.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what was most desirable in the present state of\r\naffairs; while things remained in the present state of uncertainty,\r\nthere would be much more of mystery than could ever be brought to light.\r\n\r\nOne or two circumstances cleared up, the minor ones would follow in the\r\nsame train, and they would be explained by the others; and if ever that\r\nhappy state of things were to come about, why, then there would be a\r\nperfect calm in the town.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Chillingworth was going along, he thought he observed two men\r\nsitting inside a hedge, close to a hay-rick, and thinking neither of\r\nthem had any business there, he determined to listen to their\r\nconversation, and ascertain if it had any evil tendency, or whether it\r\nconcerned the late event.\r\n\r\nHaving approached near the gate, and they being on the other side, he\r\ngot over without any noise, and, unperceived by either of them, crept\r\nclose up to them.\r\n\r\n"So you haven\'t long come from sea?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have just landed."\r\n\r\n"How is it you have thrown aside your seaman\'s clothes and taken to\r\nthese?"\r\n\r\n"Just to escape being found out."\r\n\r\n"Found out! what do you mean by that? Have you been up to anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have, Jack. I have been up to something, worse luck to me; but\r\nI\'m not to be blamed either."\r\n\r\n"What is it all about?" inquired his companion. "I always thought you\r\nwere such a steady-going old file that there was no going out of the\r\neven path with you."\r\n\r\n"Nor would there have been, but for one simple circumstance."\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you, Jack--I will tell you; you will never betray me, I am\r\nsure."\r\n\r\n"Never, by heavens!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, listen--it was this. I had been some time aboard our\r\nvessel. I had sailed before, but the captain never showed any signs of\r\nbeing a bad man, and I was willing enough to sail with him again.\r\n\r\n"He knew I was engaged to a young woman in this country, and that I was\r\nwilling to work hard to save money to make up a comfortable home for us\r\nboth, and that I would not sail again, but that I intended to remain\r\nashore, and make up my mind to a shore life."\r\n\r\n"Well, you would have a house then?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly; and that\'s what I wished to do. Well, I made a small venture\r\nin the cargo, and thought, by so doing, that I should have a chance of\r\nrealizing a sum of money that would put us both in a comfortable line of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n"Well, we went on very smoothly until we were coming back. We had\r\ndisposed of the cargo, and I had received some money, and this seemed to\r\ncause our captain to hate me, because I had been successful; but I\r\nthought there was something else in it than that, but I could not tell\r\nwhat it was that made him so intolerably cross and tyrannous.\r\n\r\n"Well, I found out, at length, he knew my intended wife. He knew her\r\nvery well, and at the same time he made every effort he could to induce\r\nme to commit some act of disobedience and insubordination; but I would\r\nnot, for it seemed to me he was trying all he could to prevent my doing\r\nmy duty with anything like comfort.\r\n\r\n"However, I learned the cause of all this afterwards. It was told me by\r\none of the crew.\r\n\r\n"\'Bill,\' said my mate, \'look out for yourself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s in the wind?\' said I.\r\n\r\n"\'Only the captain has made a dead set at you, and you\'ll be a lucky man\r\nif you escape.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s it all about?\' said I. \'I cannot understand what he means. I\r\nhave done nothing wrong. I don\'t see why I should suddenly be treated in\r\nthis way.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s all about your girl, Bill.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Indeed!\' said I. \'What can that have to do with the captain? he knows\r\nnothing of her.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, yes, he does,\' he said. \'If it were not for you he would have the\r\ngirl himself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I see now,\' said I.\r\n\r\n"\'Ay, and so can a blind man if you open his eyes; but he wants to make\r\nyou do wrong--to goad you on to do something that will give him the\r\npower of disgracing you, and, perhaps, of punishing you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He won\'t do that,\' said I.\r\n\r\n"\'I am glad to hear you say so, Bill; for, to my mind, he has made up\r\nhis mind to go the whole length against you. I can\'t make it out, unless\r\nhe wishes you were dead.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I dare say he does,\' said I; \'but I will take care I will live to\r\nexact a reckoning when he comes ashore.\'\r\n\r\n"\'That is the best; and when we are paid off, Bill, if you will take it\r\nout of him, and pay him off, why, I don\'t care if I lend you a hand.\'\r\n\r\n"\'We\'ll say more about that, Dick,\' said I, \'when we get ashore and are\r\npaid off. If we are overheard now, it will be said that we are\r\nconspiring, or committing mutiny, or something of that sort.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You are right, Bill,\' he said--\'you are right. We\'ll say no more about\r\nthis now, but you may reckon upon me when we are no longer under his\r\norders.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Then there\'s no danger, you know.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, we said nothing about this, but I thought of it, and I had cause\r\nenough, too, to think of it; for each day the captain grew more and more\r\ntyrannous and brutal. I knew not what to do, but kept my resolution of\r\ndoing my duty in spite of all he could do, though I don\'t mind admitting\r\nI had more than one mind to kill him and myself afterwards.\r\n\r\n"However, I contrived to hold out for another week or two, and then we\r\ncame into port, and were released from his tyranny. I got paid off, and\r\nthen I met my messmate, and we had some talk about the matter.\r\n\r\n"\'The worst of it is,\' said I, \'we shall have some difficulty to catch\r\nhim; and, if we can, I\'ll be sworn we shall give him enough to last him\r\nfor at least a voyage or two.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He ought to have it smart,\' said my messmate; \'and I know where he is\r\nto be found.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you?--at what hour?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Late at night, when he may be met with as he comes from a house where\r\nhe spends his evenings."\r\n\r\n"\'That will be the best time in the world, when we shall have less\r\ninterference than at any other time in the day. But we\'ll have a turn\r\nto-night if you will be with me, as he will be able to make too good a\r\ndefence to one. It will be a fight, and not a chastisement.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It will. I will be with you; you know where to meet me. I shall be at\r\nthe old spot at the usual time, and then we will go.\'\r\n\r\n"We parted; and, in the evening, we both went together, and sought the\r\nplace where we should find him out, and set upon him to advantage.\r\n\r\n"He was nearly two hours before he came; but when he did come, we\r\nsaluted him with a rap on the head, that made him hold his tongue; and\r\nthen we set to, and gave him such a tremendous drubbing, that we left\r\nhim insensible; but he was soon taken away by some watchmen, and we\r\nheard that he was doing well; but he was dreadfully beaten; indeed, it\r\nwould take him some weeks before he could be about in his duties.\r\n\r\n"He was fearfully enraged, and offered fifty pounds reward to any one\r\nwho could give him information as to who it was that assaulted him.\r\n\r\n"I believe he had a pretty good notion of who it was; but he could not\r\nswear to me; but still, seeing he was busying himself too much about me,\r\nI at once walked away, and went on my way to another part of the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"To get married?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and to get into business."\r\n\r\n"Then, things are not quite so bad as I thought for at first."\r\n\r\n"No--no, not so bad but what they might have been worse a great deal;\r\nonly I cannot go to sea any more, that\'s quite certain."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t regret that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Why not know? Are you not going to be married?--ain\'t that much\r\nbetter?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say," replied the sailor; "there\'s no knowing how my bargain\r\nmay turn out; if she does well, why, then the cruising is over; but\r\nnothing short of that will satisfy me; for if my wife is at all not what\r\nI wish her to be, why, I shall be off to sea."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t blame you, either; I would do so too, if it were possible; but\r\nyou see, we can\'t do so well on land as you do at sea; we can be\r\nfollowed about from pillar to post, and no bounds set to our\r\npersecution."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough," said the other; "we can cut and run when we have\r\nhad enough of it. However, I must get to the village, as I shall sleep\r\nthere to-night, if I find my quarters comfortable enough."\r\n\r\n"Come on, then, at once," said his companion; "it\'s getting dark now;\r\nand you have no time to lose."\r\n\r\nThese two now got up, and walked away towards the village; and\r\nChillingworth arose also, and pursued his way towards the Hall, while he\r\nremarked to himself,--\r\n\r\n"Well--well, they have nothing to do with that affair at all events.\r\nBy-the-bye, I wonder what amount of females are deserted in the navy;\r\nthey certainly have an advantage over landsmen, in the respect of being\r\ntied to tiresome partners; they can, at least, for a season, get a\r\nrelease from their troubles, and be free at sea."\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Chillingworth got to the Hall, and unobserved, for he had\r\nbeen especially careful not to be seen; he had watched on all sides, and\r\nno signs of a solitary human being had he seen, that could in any way\r\nmake the slightest observation upon him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he had sheltered himself from observation at every point of his\r\nroad, especially so when near Bannerworth Hall, where there were plenty\r\nof corners to enable him to do so; and when he arrived there, he entered\r\nat the usual spot, and then sat down a few moments in the bower.\r\n\r\n"I will not sit here," he muttered. "I will go and have a watch at that\r\nmysterious picture; there is the centre of attraction, be it what it\r\nmay."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he arose and walked into the house, and entered the same\r\napartment which has been so often mentioned to the reader.\r\n\r\nHere he took a chair, and sat down full before the picture, and began to\r\ncontemplate it.\r\n\r\n"Well, for a good likeness, I cannot say I ever saw anything more\r\nunprepossessing. I am sure such a countenance as that could never have\r\nwon a female heart. Surely, it is more calculated to terrify the\r\nimagination, than to soothe the affections of the timid and shrinking\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n"However, I will have an inspection of the picture, and see if I can\r\nmake anything of it."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he put his hand upon the picture with the intention of\r\nremoving it, when it suddenly was thrust open, and a man stepped down.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was for a moment completely staggered, it was so utterly\r\nunexpected, and he stepped back a pace or two in the first emotion of\r\nhis surprise; but this soon passed by, and he prepared to close with his\r\nantagonist, which he did without speaking a word.\r\n\r\nThere was a fair struggle for more than two or three minutes, during\r\nwhich the doctor struggled and fought most manfully; but it was evident\r\nthat Mr. Chillingworth had met with a man who was his superior in point\r\nof strength, for he not only withstood the utmost force that\r\nChillingworth could bring against him, but maintained himself, and\r\nturned his strength against the doctor.\r\n\r\nChillingworth panted with exertion, and found himself gradually losing\r\nground, and was upon the point of being thrown down at the mercy of his\r\nadversary, who appeared to be inclined to take all advantages of him,\r\nwhen an occurrence happened that altered the state of affairs\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nWhile they were struggling, the doctor borne partially to the earth--but\r\nyet struggling, suddenly his antagonist released his hold, and staggered\r\nback a few paces.\r\n\r\n"There, you swab--take that; I am yard-arm and yard-arm with you, you\r\npiratical-looking craft--you lubberly, buccaneering son of a fish-fag."\r\n\r\nBefore, however, Jack Pringle, for it was he who came so opportunely to\r\nthe rescue of Doctor Chillingworth, could find time to finish the\r\nsentence, he found himself assailed by the very man who, but a minute\r\nbefore, he had, as he thought, placed _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA desperate fight ensued, and the stranger made the greatest efforts to\r\nescape with the picture, but found he could not get off without a\r\ndesperate struggle. He was, at length, compelled to relinquish the hope\r\nof carrying that off, for both Mr. Chillingworth and Jack Pringle were\r\nengaged hand to hand; but the stranger struck Jack so heavy a blow on\r\nthe head, that made him reel a few yards, and then he escaped through\r\nthe window, leaving Jack and Mr. Chillingworth masters of the field, but\r\nby no means unscathed by the conflict in which they had been engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CONSULTATION BROKEN UP BY MRS. CHILLINGWORTH, AND THE\r\nDISAPPEARANCE OF VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRemarkable was the change that had taken place in the circumstances of\r\nthe Bannerworth family. From a state of great despondency, and, indeed,\r\nabsolute poverty, they had suddenly risen to comfort and independence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the clouds that had obscured their destiny, had now,\r\nwith one accord, dissipated, and that a brighter day was dawning. Not\r\nonly had the circumstances of mental terror which had surrounded them\r\ngiven way in a great measure to the light of truth and reflection, but\r\nthose pecuniary distresses which had pressed upon them for a time, were\r\nlikewise passing away, and it seemed probable that they would be in a\r\nprosperous condition.\r\n\r\n_The acquisition of the title deeds of the estate_, which they thought\r\nhad passed away from the family for ever, became to them, in their\r\npresent circumstances, an immense acquisition, and brought to their\r\nminds a feeling of great contentment.\r\n\r\nMany persons in their situation would have been extremely satisfied at\r\nhaving secured so strong an interest in the mind of the old admiral, who\r\nwas very wealthy, and who, from what he had already said and done, no\r\ndoubt fully intended to provide handsomely for the Bannerworth family.\r\n\r\nAnd not only had they this to look forward to, if they had chosen to\r\nregard it as an advantage, but they knew that by the marriage of Flora\r\nwith Charles Holland she would have a fortune at her disposal, while he\r\n(Charles) would be the last man in the world to demur at any reasonable\r\namount of it being lavished upon her mother and her brothers.\r\n\r\nBut all this did not suit the high and independent spirit of Henry\r\nBannerworth. He was one who would rather have eaten the dust that he\r\nprocured for himself by some meritorious exertion, than have feasted on\r\nthe most delicate viands placed before him from the resources of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut now that he knew this small estate, the title deeds of which had\r\nbeen so singularly obtained, had once really belonged to the family, but\r\nhad been risked and lost at the gaming-table, he had no earthly scruple\r\nin calling such property again his own.\r\n\r\nAs to the large sum of money which Sir Francis Varney in his confessions\r\nhad declared to have found its way into the possession of Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth, Henry did not expect, and scarcely wished to become\r\npossessed of wealth through so tainted a source.\r\n\r\n"No," he said to himself frequently; "no--I care not if that wealth be\r\nnever forthcoming, which was so badly got possession of. Let it sink\r\ninto the earth, if, indeed, it be buried there; or let it rot in some\r\nunknown corner of the old mansion. I care not for it."\r\n\r\nIn this view of the case he was not alone, for a family more unselfish,\r\nor who cared so little for money, could scarcely have been found; but\r\nAdmiral Bell and Charles Holland argued now that they had a right to the\r\namount of money which Marmaduke Bannerworth had hidden somewhere, and\r\nthe old admiral reasoned upon it rather ingeniously, for he said,--\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t mean to dispute that the money belongs to somebody,\r\nand in that case I should like to know who else it belonged to, if not\r\nto you? How do you get over that, master Henry?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t attempt to get over it at all," said Henry; "all I say is, that\r\nI do dislike the whole circumstances connected with it, and the manner\r\nin which it was come by; and, now that we have a small independence, I\r\nhope it will not be found. But, admiral, we are going to hold a family\r\nconsultation as to what we shall do, and what is to become of Varney. He\r\nhas convinced me of his relationship to our family, and, although his\r\nconduct has certainly been extremely equivocal, he has made all the\r\namends in his power; and now, as he is getting old, I do not like to\r\nthrow him upon the wide world for a subsistence."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t contemplate," said the admiral, "letting him remain with you,\r\ndo you?"\r\n\r\n"No; that would be objectionable for a variety of reasons; and I could\r\nnot think of it for a moment."\r\n\r\n"I should think not. The idea of sitting down to breakfast, dinner, tea,\r\nand supper with a vampyre, and taking your grog with a fellow that sucks\r\nother people\'s blood!"\r\n\r\n"Really, admiral, you do not really still cling to the idea that Sir\r\nFrancis Varney is a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know; he clings to it himself, that\'s all I can say; and\r\nI think, under those circumstances, I might as well give him the benefit\r\nof his own proposition, and suppose that he is a vampyre."\r\n\r\n"Really, uncle," said Charles Holland, "I did think that you had\r\ndiscarded the notion."\r\n\r\n"Did you? I have been thinking of it, and it ain\'t so desirable to be a\r\nvampyre, I am sure, that any one should pretend to it who is not;\r\ntherefore, I take the fellow upon his own showing. He is a vampyre in\r\nhis own opinion, and so I don\'t see, for the life of me, why he should\r\nnot be so in ours."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Henry, "waving all that, what are we to do with him?\r\nCircumstances seem to have thrown him completely at our mercy. What are\r\nwe to do with him, and what is to become of him for the future?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," said the admiral. "If he were ten times a\r\nvampyre, there is some good in the fellow; and I will give him enough to\r\nlive upon if he will go to America and spend it. They will take good\r\ncare there that he sucks no blood out of them; for, although an American\r\nwould always rather lose a drop of blood than a dollar, they keep a\r\npretty sharp look out upon both."\r\n\r\n"The proposal can be made to him," said Henry, "at all events. It is one\r\nwhich I don\'t dislike, and probably one that he would embrace at once;\r\nbecause he seems, to me, to have completely done with ambition, and to\r\nhave abandoned those projects concerning which, at one time, he took\r\nsuch a world of trouble."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you trust to that," said the admiral. "What\'s bred in the bone\r\ndon\'t so easily get out of the flesh; and once or twice, when Master\r\nVarney has been talking, I have seen those odd looking eyes of his flash\r\nup for a moment, as if he were quite ready to begin his old capers\r\nagain, and alarm the whole country side."\r\n\r\n"I must confess," said Charles Holland, "that I myself have had the\r\nimpression once or twice that Varney was only subdued for a time, and\r\nthat, with a proper amount of provocation, he would become again a very\r\nserious fellow, and to the full as troublesome as he has been."\r\n\r\n"Do you doubt his sincerity?" said Henry.\r\n\r\n"No, I do not do that, Henry: I think Varney fully means what he says;\r\nbut I think, at the same time, that he has for so long lead a strange,\r\nwild, and reckless life, that he will find it very far from easy, if\r\nindeed possible, to shake off his old habits and settle down quietly, if\r\nnot to say comfortably."\r\n\r\n"I regret," said Henry, "that you have such an impression; but, while I\r\ndo so, I cannot help admitting that it is, to a considerable extent, no\r\nmore than a reasonable one; and perhaps, after all, my expectation that\r\nVarney will give us no more trouble, only amounts to a hope that he will\r\nnot do so, and nothing more. But let us consider; there seems to be some\r\nslight difference of opinion among us, as to whether we should take up\r\nour residence at this new house of ours, which we did not know we owned,\r\nat Dearbrook, or proceed to London, and there establish ourselves, or\r\nagain return to Bannerworth Hall, and, by a judicious expenditure of\r\nsome money, make that a more habitable place than it has been for the\r\nlast twenty years."\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you what," said the admiral, "I would do. It\'s quite out\r\nof the question for any body to live long unless they see a ship; don\'t\r\nyou think so, Miss Flora?"\r\n\r\n"Why, how can you ask Flora such a question, uncle," said Charles\r\nHolland, "when you know she don\'t care a straw about ships, and only\r\nlooks upon admirals as natural curiosities?"\r\n\r\n"Excepting one," said Flora, "and he is an admiral who is natural but no\r\ncuriosity, unless it be that you, can call him such because he is so\r\njust and generous, and, as for ships, who can help admiring them; and if\r\nAdmiral Bell proposes that we live in some pleasant, marine villa by the\r\nsea-coast, he shall have my vote and interest for the proceeding."\r\n\r\n"Bravo! Huzza!" cried the admiral. "I tell you what it is, Master\r\nCharley--you horse marine,--I have a great mind to cut you out, and have\r\nMiss Flora myself."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, uncle," said Charles; "that would be so very cruel, after she\r\nhas promised me so faithfully. How do you suppose I should like it; come\r\nnow, be merciful."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and before any one could make another remark, there came\r\nrather a sharp ring at the garden-gate bell, and Henry exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"That\'s Mr. Chillingworth, and I am glad he has come in time to join our\r\nconference. His advice is always valuable; and, moreover, I rather think\r\nhe will bring us some news worth the hearing."\r\n\r\nThe one servant who they had to wait upon them looked into the room, and\r\nsaid,--"If you please, here is Mrs. Chillingworth."\r\n\r\n"Mistress? you mean Mr."\r\n\r\n"No; it is Mrs. Chillingworth and her baby."\r\n\r\n"The devil!" said the admiral; "what can she want?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come and let you know," said Mrs. Chillingworth, "what I want;"\r\nand she darted into the room past the servant. "I\'ll soon let you know,\r\nyou great sea crab. I want my husband; and what with your vampyre, and\r\none thing and another, I haven\'t had him at home an hour for the past\r\nthree weeks. What am I to do? There is all his patients getting well as\r\nfast as they can without him; and, when they find that out, do you think\r\nthey will take any more filthy physic? No, to be sure not; people ain\'t\r\nsuch fools as to do anything of the sort."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what we will do, ma\'am," said the admiral; "we\'ll all get\r\nill at once, on purpose to oblige ye; and I\'ll begin by having the\r\nmeasles."\r\n\r\n"You are an old porpoise, and I believe it all owing to you that my\r\nhusband neglects his wife and family. What\'s vampyres to him, I should\r\nlike to know, that he should go troubling about them? I never heard of\r\nvampyres taking draughts and pills."\r\n\r\n"No, nor any body else that had the sense of a goose," said the admiral;\r\n"but if it\'s your husband you want, ma\'am, it\'s no use your looking for\r\nhim here, for here he is not."\r\n\r\n"Then where is he? He is running after some of your beastly vampyres\r\nsomewhere, I\'ll be bound, and you know where to send for him."\r\n\r\n"Then you are mistaken; for, indeed, we don\'t. We want him ourselves,\r\nma\'am, and can\'t find him--that\'s the fact."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well talking, sir, but if you were a married woman, with\r\na family about you, and the last at the breast, you\'d feel very\r\ndifferent from what you do now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m d----d if I don\'t suppose I should," said the admiral; "but as for\r\nthe last, ma\'am, I\'d soon settle that. I\'d wring its neck, and shove it\r\noverboard."\r\n\r\n"You would, you brute? It\'s quite clear to me you never had a child of\r\nyour own."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Chillingworth," said Henry, "I think you have no right to complain\r\nto us of your domestic affairs. Where your husband goes, and what he\r\ndoes, is at his own will and pleasure, and, really, I don\'t see that we\r\nare to be made answerable as to whether he is at home or abroad; to say\r\nnothing of the bad taste--and bad taste it most certainly is, of talking\r\nof your private affairs to other people."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" said Mrs. Chillingworth; "that\'s your idea, is it, you\r\nno-whiskered puppy?"\r\n\r\n"Really, madam, I cannot see what my being destitute of whiskers has to\r\ndo with the affair; and I am inclined to think my opinion is quite as\r\ngood without them as with them."\r\n\r\n"I will speak," said Flora, "to the doctor, when I see him."\r\n\r\n"Will you, Miss Doll\'s-eyes? Oh, dear me! you\'ll speak to the doctor,\r\nwill you?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you want?" said Henry. "For your husband\'s sake, whom\r\nwe all respect, we wish to treat you with every imaginable civility; but\r\nwe tell you, candidly, that he is not here, and, therefore, we cannot\r\nconceive what more you can require of us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a row," said the admiral; "that\'s what she wants--woman like.\r\nD----d a bit do they care what it\'s about as long as there\'s a\r\ndisturbance. And now, ma\'am, will you sit down and have a glass of\r\ngrog?"\r\n\r\n"No, I will not sit down; and all I can say is, that I look upon this\r\nplace as a den full of snakes and reptiles. That\'s my opinion; so I\'ll\r\nnot stay any longer; but, wishing that great judgments may some day come\r\nhome to you all, and that you may know what it is to be a mother, with\r\nfive babies, and one at the breast, I despise you all and leave you."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mrs. Chillingworth walked from the place, feeling herself\r\nhighly hurt and offended at what had ensued; and they were compelled to\r\nlet her go just as she was, without giving her any information, for they\r\nhad a vivid recollection of the serious disturbance she had created on a\r\nformer occasion, when she had actually headed a mob, for the purpose of\r\nhunting out Varney, the vampyre, from Bannerworth Hall, and putting an\r\nend consequently, as she considered, to that set of circumstances which\r\nkept the doctor so much from his house, to the great detriment of a not\r\nvery extensive practice.\r\n\r\n"After all," said Flora, "Mrs. Chillingworth, although she is not the\r\nmost refined person in the world, is to be pitied."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried the admiral; "Miss Doll\'s-eyes, are you taking her part?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s nothing. She may call me what she likes."\r\n\r\n"I believe she is a good wife to the doctor," said Henry,\r\n"notwithstanding his little eccentricities; but suppose we now at once\r\nmake the proposal we were thinking of to Sir Francis Varney, and so get\r\nhim to leave England as quickly as possible and put an end to the\r\npossibility of his being any more trouble to anybody."\r\n\r\n"Agreed--agreed. It\'s the best thing that can be done, and it will be\r\nsomething gained to get his consent at once."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run up stairs to him," said Charles, "and call him down at once. I\r\nscarcely doubt for a moment his acquiescence in the proposal."\r\n\r\nCharles Holland rose, and ran up the little staircase of the cottage to\r\nthe room which, by the kindness of the Bannerworth family, had been\r\ndevoted to the use of Varney. He had not been gone above two minutes,\r\nwhen he returned, hastily, with a small scrap of paper in his hand,\r\nwhich he laid before Henry, saying,--\r\n\r\n"There, what think you of that?"\r\n\r\nHenry, upon taking up the paper, saw written upon it the words,--\r\n\r\n"_The Farewell of Varney the Vampyre_."\r\n\r\n"He is gone," said Charles Holland. "The room is vacant. I saw at a\r\nglance that he had removed his hat, and cloak, and all that belonged to\r\nhim. He\'s off, and at so short a warning, and in so abrupt a manner,\r\nthat I fear the worst."\r\n\r\n"What can you fear?"\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know what; but we have a right to fear everything and\r\nanything from his most inexplicable being, whose whole conduct has been\r\nof that mysterious nature, as to put him past all calculation as regards\r\nhis motives, his objects, or his actions. I must confess that I would\r\nhave hailed his departure from England with feelings of satisfaction;\r\nbut what he means now, by this strange manoeuvre, Heaven, and his own\r\nsingular intellect, can alone divine."\r\n\r\n"I must confess," said Flora, "I should not at all have thought this of\r\nVarney. It seems to me as if something new must have occurred to him.\r\nAltogether, I do not feel any alarm concerning his actions as regards\r\nus. I am convinced of his sincerity, and, therefore, do not view with\r\nsensations of uneasiness this new circumstance, which appears at present\r\nso inexplicable, but for which we may yet get some explanation that will\r\nbe satisfactory to us all."\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive," said Henry, "what new circumstances could have\r\noccurred to produce this effect upon Varney. Things remain just as they\r\nwere; and, after all, situated as he is, if any change had taken place\r\nin matters out of doors, I do not see how he could become acquainted\r\nwith them, so that his leaving must have been a matter of mere\r\ncalculation, or of impulse at the moment--Heaven knows which--but can\r\nhave nothing to do with actual information, because it is quite evident\r\nhe could not get it."\r\n\r\n"It is rather strange," said Charles Holland, "that just as we were\r\nspeculating upon the probability of his doing something of this sort, he\r\nshould suddenly do it, and in this singular manner too."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the old admiral, "I told you I saw his eye, that was enough\r\nfor me. I knew he would do something, as well as I know a mainmast from\r\na chain cable. He can\'t help it; it\'s in the nature of the beast, and\r\nthat\'s all you can say about it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII.\r\n\r\nTHE MISADVENTURE OF THE DOCTOR WITH THE PICTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation of Dr. Chillingworth and Jack Pringle was not of that\r\ncharacter that permitted much conversation or even congratulation. They\r\nwere victors it was true, and yet they had but little to boast of\r\nbesides the victory.\r\n\r\nVictory is a great thing; it is like a gilded coat, it bewilders and\r\ndazzles. Nobody can say much when you are victorious. What a sound! and\r\nyet how much misery is there not hidden beneath it.\r\n\r\nThis victory of the worthy doctor and his aid amounted to this, they\r\nwere as they were before, without being any better, but much the worse,\r\nseeing they were so much buffetted that they could hardly speak, but sat\r\nfor some moments opposite to each other, gasping for breath, and staring\r\neach other in the face without speaking.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight came in through the window and fell upon the floor, and\r\nthere were no sounds that came to disturb the stillness of the scene,\r\nnor any object that moved to cast a shadow upon the floor. All was still\r\nand motionless, save the two victors, who were much distressed and\r\nbruised.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Jack Pringle, with a hearty execration, as he wiped his\r\nface with the back of his hand; "saving your presence, doctor, we are\r\nmasters of the field, doctor; but it\'s plaguey like capturing an empty\r\nbandbox after a hard fight."\r\n\r\n"But we have got the picture, Jack--we have got the picture, you see,\r\nand that is something. I am sure we saved that."\r\n\r\n"Well, that may be; and a pretty d----d looking picture it is after all.\r\nWhy, it\'s enough to frighten a lady into the sulks. I think it would be\r\na very good thing if it were burned."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the doctor, "I would sooner see it burned than in the hands\r\nof that--"\r\n\r\n"What?" exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but thief I should say, for it\r\nwas somewhat thief-like to break into another man\'s house and carry off\r\nthe furniture."\r\n\r\n"A pirate--a regular land shark."\r\n\r\n"Something that is not the same as an honest man, Jack; but, at all\r\nevents, we have beaten him back this time."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack, "the ship\'s cleared; no company is better than bad\r\ncompany, doctor."\r\n\r\n"So it is, and yet it don\'t seem clear in terms. But, Jack, it you\r\nhadn\'t come in time, I should have been but scurvily treated. He was too\r\npowerful for me; I was as nigh being killed as ever I have been; but you\r\nwere just in time to save me."\r\n\r\n"Well, he was a large, ugly fellow, sure enough, and looked like an old\r\ntree."\r\n\r\n"Did you see him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure I did."\r\n\r\n"Well, I could not catch a glimpse of his features. In fact, I was too\r\nmuch employed to see anything, and it was much too dark to notice\r\nanything particular, even if I had had leisure."\r\n\r\n"Why, you had as much to do as you could well manage, I must say that,\r\nat all events. I didn\'t see much of him myself; only he was a tall,\r\nout-of-the-way sort of chap--a long-legged shark. He gave me such a dig\r\nor two as I haven\'t had for a long while, nor don\'t want to get again;\r\nthough I don\'t care if I face the devil himself. A man can\'t do more\r\nthan do his best, doctor."\r\n\r\n"No, Jack; but there are very few who do do their best, and that\'s the\r\ntruth. You have, and have done it to some purpose too. But I have had\r\nenough for one day; he was almost strong enough to contend against us\r\nboth."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so he was."\r\n\r\n"And, besides that, he almost carried away the picture--that was a great\r\nhindrance to him. Don\'t you think we could have held him if we had not\r\nbeen fighting over the picture?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure we could; we could have gone at him bodily, and held\r\nhim. He would not have been able to use his hands. We could have hung on\r\nhim, and I am sure if I came to grapple yard-arm and yard-arm, he would\r\nhave told a different tale; however, that is neither here nor there. How\r\nlong had you been here?"\r\n\r\n"Not very long," replied the doctor, whose head was a little confused by\r\nthe blows which he had received. "I can\'t now tell how long, but only a\r\nshort time, I think."\r\n\r\n"Where did he come from?" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n"Come from, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, doctor, where did he came from?--the window, I suppose--the same\r\nway he went out, I dare say--it\'s most likely."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no; he come down from behind the picture. There\'s some mystery\r\nin that picture, I\'ll swear to it; it\'s very strange he should make such\r\na desperate attempt to carry it away."\r\n\r\n"Yes; one would think," said Jack, "there was more in it than we can\r\nsee--that it is worth more than we can believe; perhaps somebody sets\r\nparticular store by it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Mr. Chillingworth, shaking his head, "I don\'t know\r\nhow that may be; but certain it is, the picture was the object of his\r\nvisit here--that is very certain."\r\n\r\n"It was; he was endeavouring to carry it off," said Jack; "it would be a\r\nvery good ornament to the black hole at Calcutta."\r\n\r\n"The utility of putting it where it cannot be seen," remarked Mr.\r\nChillingworth, "I cannot very well see; though I dare say it might be\r\nall very well."\r\n\r\n"Yes--its ugly features would be no longer seen; so far, it would be a\r\ngood job. But are you going to remain here all night, and so make a long\r\nwatch of it, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Jack," said the doctor, "I did intend watching here; but now the\r\ngame is disturbed, it is of no use remaining here. We have secured the\r\npicture, and now there will be no need of remaining in the house; in\r\nfact, there is no fear of robbery now."\r\n\r\n"Not so long as we are here," said Jack Pringle; "the smugglers won\'t\r\nshow a head while the revenue cutter is on the look out."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "I think we have scared\r\nthem away--the picture is safe."\r\n\r\n"Yes--so long as we are here."\r\n\r\n"And longer, too, I hope."\r\n\r\nJack shook his head, as much as to intimate that he had many doubts upon\r\nsuch a point, and couldn\'t be hurried into any concession of opinion of\r\nthe safety of such a picture as that--much as he disliked it, and as\r\npoor an opinion as he had of it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it will be safe?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Mr. Chillingworth, willing to hear what Jack could\r\nadvance against the opinion he had expressed, especially as he had\r\ndisturbed the marauder in the very act of robbery.\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'ll be watched by this very man; and when you are gone, he will\r\nreturn in safety, and take this plaguey picture away with him."\r\n\r\n"Well, he might do so," said Mr. Chillingworth, after some thought; "he\r\neven endangered his own escape for the purpose of carrying it off."\r\n\r\n"He wants it," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"What, the picture?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, to be sure; do you think anybody would have tried so hard to get\r\naway with it? He wants it; and the long and the short of it is, he will\r\nhave it, despite all that can be done to prevent it; that\'s my opinion."\r\n\r\n"Well, there is much truth in that; but what to do I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Take it to the cottage," suggested Jack. "The picture must be more than\r\nwe think for; suppose we carry it along."\r\n\r\n"That is no bad plan of yours, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "and,\r\nthough a little awkward, yet it is not the worst I have heard;\r\nbut--but--what will they say, when they see this frightful face in that\r\nquiet, yet contented house?"\r\n\r\n"Why, they\'ll say you brought it," said Jack; "I don\'t see what else\r\nthey can say, but that you have done well; besides, when you come to\r\nexplain, you will make the matter all right to \'em."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Chillingworth; "and, as the picture now seems to be the\r\nincomprehensible object of attack, I will secure that, at all events."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Jack; your aid will be welcome; at least, it was so just\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"All right, doctor," said Jack. "I may be under your hands some day."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll physic you for nothing," said Mr. Chillingworth. "You saved my\r\nlife. One good turn deserves another; I\'ll not forget."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Jack, as he made a wry face. "I hope you won\'t have\r\noccasion. I\'d sooner have a can of grog than any bottle of medicine you\r\ncan give me; I ain\'t ungrateful, neither."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t name it; I am getting my breath again. I suppose we had\r\nbetter leave this place, as soon as we conveniently can."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. The sooner the better; we can take it the more leisurely as we\r\ngo."\r\n\r\nThe moon was up; there were no clouds now, but there was not a very\r\nstrong light, because the moon was on the wane. It was one of those\r\nnights during which an imperceptible vapour arises, and renders the moon\r\nsomewhat obscure, or, at least, it robs the earth of her rays; and then\r\nthere were shadows cast by the moon, yet they grew fainter, and those\r\ncast upon the floor of the apartment were less distinct than at first.\r\n\r\nThere seemed scarce a breath of air stirring; everything was quiet and\r\nstill; no motion--no sound, save that of the breathing of the two who\r\nsat in that mysterious apartment, who gazed alternately round the place,\r\nand then in each other\'s countenances. Suddenly, the silence of the\r\nnight was disturbed by a very slight, but distinct noise, which struck\r\nupon them with peculiar distinctness; it was a gentle tap, tap, at the\r\nwindow, as if some one was doing it with their fingernail.\r\n\r\nThey gazed on each other, for some moments, in amazement, and then at\r\nthe window, but they saw nothing; and yet, had there been anything, they\r\nmust have seen it, but there was not even a shadow.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, after he had listened to the tap, tap,\r\nseveral times, without being able to find out or imagine what it could\r\narise from, "what on earth can it be?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," said Jack, very composedly, squinting up at the window.\r\n"Can\'t see anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, but it must be something," persisted Mr. Chillingworth; "it must\r\nbe something."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it is; but I don\'t see anything. I can\'t think what it can\r\nbe, unless--"\r\n\r\n"Unless what? Speak out," said the doctor, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Why, unless it is Davy Jones himself, tapping with his long\r\nfinger-nails, a-telling us as how we\'ve been too long already here."\r\n\r\n"Then, I presume, we may as well go; and yet I am more disposed to deem\r\nit some device of the enemy to dislodge us from this place, for the\r\npurpose of enabling them to effect some nefarious scheme or other they\r\nhave afloat."\r\n\r\n"It may be, and is, I dare say, a do of some sort or other," said Jack;\r\n"but what\' can it be?"\r\n\r\n"There it is again," said the doctor; "don\'t you hear it? I can, as\r\nplain as I can hear myself."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack; "I can hear it plain enough, and can see it, too; and\r\nthat is more. Yes, yes, I can tell all about it plain enough."\r\n\r\n"You can? Well, then, shew me," said the doctor, as he strode up to the\r\nwindow, before which Jack was standing gazing upon one particular spot\r\nof the shattered window with much earnestness.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Look there," said Jack, pointing with his finger to a particular spot,\r\nto which the doctor directed his attention, expecting to see a long,\r\nskinny hand tapping against the glass; but he saw nothing.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Do you see that twig of ivy, or something of the sort?" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do."\r\n\r\n"Very well, watch that; and when the wind catches it--and there is but\r\nvery little--it lifts it up, and then, falling down again, it taps the\r\nglass."\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke, there came a slight gust of wind; and it gave a\r\npractical illustration to his words; for the tapping was heard as often\r\nas the plant was moved by the wind.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "however simple and unimportant the\r\nmatter may be, yet I cannot but say I am always well pleased to find a\r\npractical explanation of it, so that there will be no part left in\r\ndoubt."\r\n\r\n"There is none about that," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"None. Well, we are not beset, then. We may as well consider of the\r\nmanner of our getting clear of this place. What sort of burthen this\r\npicture may be I know not; but I will make the attempt to carry it."\r\n\r\n"Avast, there," said Jack; "I will carry it: at all events, I\'ll take\r\nthe first spell, and, if I can\'t go on, we\'ll turn and turn about."\r\n\r\n"We can divide the weight from the first, and then neither of us will be\r\ntired at all."\r\n\r\n"Just as you please, sir," said Jack Pringle. "I am willing to obey\r\norders; and, if we are to get in to-night before they are all a-bed, we\r\nhad better go at once; and then we shall not disturb them."\r\n\r\n"Good, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "very good: let us begin to beat\r\nour retreat at once."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Jack.\r\n\r\nThey both rose and approached the picture, which stood up in one corner,\r\nhalf reclining against the wall; the light, at least so much as there\r\nwas, fell upon it, and gave it a ghastly and deathly hue, which made Mr.\r\nChillingworth feel an emotion he could not at all understand; but, as\r\nsoon as he could, he withdrew his eyes from off the picture, and they\r\nproceeded to secure it with some cord, so that they might carry it\r\nbetween them the easier--with less trouble and more safety.\r\n\r\nThese preparations did not take long in making, and, when completed,\r\nthey gave another inquiring look round the chamber, and Mr.\r\nChillingworth again approached the window, and gazed out upon the garden\r\nbelow, but saw nothing to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nTurning away, he came to the picture, with which Jack Pringle had been\r\nstanding. They proceeded towards the stairs, adopting every precaution\r\nthey could take to prevent any surprise and any attempt upon the object\r\nof their solicitude.\r\n\r\nThen they came to the great hall, and, having opened the door, they\r\ncarried it out; then shutting the door, they both stood outside of\r\nBannerworth Hall; and, before taking the picture up in their hands, they\r\nonce more looked suspiciously around them.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be seen, and so, shouldering the ominous portrait,\r\nthey proceeded along the garden till they conveyed it into the roadway.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Jack, "we are off; we can scud along under press of sail,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"I would rather not," said the doctor, "for two reasons; one of which\r\nis, I can\'t do it myself, and the other is, we should run the risk of\r\ninjuring the picture; besides this, there is no reason for so doing."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Jack, "make it agreeable to yourself, doctor. See you,\r\nJack\'s alive, and I am willing to do all I can to help you."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad of your aid," said Mr. Chillingworth; "so we will\r\nproceed slowly. I shall be glad when we are there; for there are few\r\nthings more awkward than this picture to carry."\r\n\r\n"It is not heavy," said Jack, giving it a hitch up, that first pulled\r\nthe doctor back, and then pushed him forward again.\r\n\r\n"No; but stop, don\'t do that often, Jack, or else I shall be obliged to\r\nlet go, to save myself from falling," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Very sorry," said Jack; "hope it didn\'t inconvenience you; but I could\r\ncarry this by myself."\r\n\r\n"And so could I," returned Mr. Chillingworth; "but the probability is\r\nthere would be some mischief done to it, and then we should be doing\r\nmore harm than good."\r\n\r\n"So we should," said Jack.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded along with much care and caution. It was growing late\r\nnow, and no one was about--at least, they met none. People did not roam\r\nabout much after dark, especially since the reports of the vampyre\r\nbecame current, for, notwithstanding all their bravery and violence\r\nwhile in a body, yet to meet and contend with him singly, and unseen,\r\nwas not at all a popular notion among them; indeed, they would sooner go\r\na mile out of their way, or remain in doors, which they usually did.\r\n\r\nThe evening was not precisely dark, there was moonlight enough to save\r\nit from that, but there was a mist hanging about, that rendered objects,\r\nat a short distance, very indistinct.\r\n\r\nTheir walk was uninterrupted by any one, and they had got through half\r\nthe distance without any disturbance or interruption whatever.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the precincts of the village, Jack Pringle said to\r\nDr. Chillingworth, "Do you intend going through the village, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? there will be nobody about, and if there should be, we shall\r\nbe safe enough from any molestation, seeing there are none here who\r\nwould dare to harm us; it is the shortest way, too."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Jack; "I am agreeable, and as for any one harming me,\r\nthey know better; but, at all events, there\'s company, and there\'s less\r\ndanger, you know, doctor; though I\'m always company to myself, but\r\nhaven\'t any objection to a messmate, now and then."\r\n\r\nThey pursued their way in silence, for some distance, the doctor not\r\ncaring about continuing the talk of Jack, which amounted to nothing;\r\nbesides, he had too much to do, for, notwithstanding the lightness of\r\nthe picture, which Jack had endeavoured to persuade the doctor of, he\r\nfound it was heavy and ungainly; indeed, had he been by himself he would\r\nhave had some trouble to have got it away.\r\n\r\n"We are nearly there," said Jack, putting down his end of the picture,\r\nwhich brought Doctor Chillingworth to a standstill.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we are; but what made you stop?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you see," said Jack, giving his trowsers a hitch, "as I said\r\nbefore, we are nearly there."\r\n\r\n"Well, what of that? we intended to go there, did we not?" inquired\r\nChillingworth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly; that is, you intended to do so, I know, but I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?" inquired Chillingworth; "you are a complete\r\nriddle to-night, Jack; what is the matter with you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; only, you see, I don\'t want to go into the cottage, \'cause,\r\nyou see, the admiral and I have had what you may call a bit of a growl,\r\nand I am in disgrace there a little, though I don\'t know why, or\r\nwherefore; I always did my duty by him, as I did by my country. The ould\r\nman, however, takes fits into his head; at the same time I shall take\r\nsome too; Jack\'s as good as his master, ashore, at all events."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you object to go in?" said Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n"That is the state of the case; not that I\'m afraid, or have any cause\r\nto be ashamed of myself; but I don\'t want to make anybody else\r\nuncomfortable, by causing black looks."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Jack," said the doctor. "I am much obliged to you, and, if\r\nyou don\'t like to come, I won\'t press you against your inclination."\r\n\r\n"I understand, doctor. I will leave you here, if you can manage the rest\r\nof the way by yourself; there are not two hundred yards now to go, so\r\nyou are all safe; so good bye."\r\n\r\n"Good bye, Jack," said Doctor Chillingworth, who stood wiping his\r\nforehead, whilst the picture was standing up against the poles.\r\n\r\n"Do you want a hand up first?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; I can get it up very well without any trouble--it\'s not\r\nso heavy."\r\n\r\n"Good bye, then," said Jack; and, in a few moments more, Jack Pringle\r\nwas out of sight, and the doctor was alone with the ominous picture. He\r\nhad not far to go, and was within hail of the cottage; but it was late,\r\nand yet he believed he should find them up, for the quietude and\r\ncalmness of the evening hour was that which most chimed with their\r\nfeelings. At such a time they could look out upon the face of nature,\r\nand the freedom of thought appeared the greater, because there was no\r\nhuman being to clash with the silence and stillness of the scene.\r\n\r\n"Well," muttered Chillingworth, "I\'ll go at once to the cottage with my\r\nburthen. How they will look at me, and wonder what could induce me to\r\nbring this away. I can hardly help smiling at the thought of how they\r\nwill look at the apparition I shall make."\r\n\r\nThus filled with notions that appeared to please him, the doctor\r\nshouldered the picture, and walked slowly along until he reached the\r\ndead wall that ran up to the entrance, or nearly so, of the gardens.\r\n\r\nThere was a plantation of young trees that overhung the path, and cast a\r\ndeep shadow below--a pleasant spot in hot weather.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had been carrying the picture, resting the side of it on the\r\nsmall of his arm, and against his shoulder; but this was an inconvenient\r\nposture, because the weight of the picture cut his arm so much, that he\r\nwas compelled to pause, and shift it more on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"There," he muttered, "that will do for the present, and last until I\r\nreach the cottage garden."\r\n\r\nHe was proceeding along at a slow and steady pace, bestowing all his\r\ncare and attention to the manner of holding the picture, when he was\r\nsuddenly paralysed by the sound of a great shout of such a peculiar\r\ncharacter, that he involuntarily stopped, and the next moment, something\r\nheavy came against him with great force, just as if a man had jumped\r\nfrom the wall on to him.\r\n\r\nThis was the truth, for, in another moment, and before he could recover\r\nhimself, he found that there was an attempt to deprive him of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThis at once aroused him, and he made an instant and a vigorous defence;\r\nbut he was compelled to let go his hold of the picture, and turn to\r\nresist the infuriated attack that was now commenced upon himself.\r\n\r\nFor some moments it was doubtful who would be the victor; but the wind\r\nand strength of the doctor were not enough to resist the powerful\r\nadversary against whom he had to contend, and the heavy blows that were\r\nshowered down upon him.\r\n\r\nAt first he was enabled to bear up against this attack; and then he\r\nreturned many of the blows with interest; but the stunning effect of the\r\nblows he received himself, was such that he could not help himself, and\r\nfelt his senses gradually failing, his strength becoming less and less.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, he received such a blow, that he was laid senseless on\r\nthe earth in an instant.\r\n\r\nHow long he remained thus he could not say; but it could not have been\r\nlong, for all around him seemed just as it was before he was attacked.\r\n\r\nThe moon had scarcely moved, and the shadows, such as they were, were\r\nfalling in the same direction as before.\r\n\r\n"I have not been long here," he muttered, after a few moments\'\r\nreflection; "but--but--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short; for, on looking around him, he saw the object of his\r\nsolicitude was gone. The picture was nowhere to be seen. It had been\r\ncarried off the instant he had been vanquished.\r\n\r\n"Gone!" he said, in a low, disconsolate tone; "and after all I have\r\ndone!"\r\n\r\nHe wiped his hand across his brow, and finding it cut, he looked at the\r\nback of his hand, and saw by the deep colour that it was blood, indeed,\r\nhe could now feel it trickle down his face.\r\n\r\nWhat to do he hardly knew; he could stand, and after having got upon his\r\nfeet, he staggered back against the wall, against which he leaned for\r\nsupport, and afterwards he crept along with the aid of its support,\r\nuntil he came to the door.\r\n\r\nHe was observed from the window, where Henry and Charles Holland, seeing\r\nhim come up with such an unsteady gait, rushed to the door to ascertain\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n"What, doctor!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth; "what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I am almost dead, I think," said Chillingworth. "Lend me your arm,\r\nHenry."\r\n\r\nHenry and Charles Holland immediately stepped out, and took him between\r\nthem into the parlour, and placed him upon a couch.\r\n\r\n"What on earth has happened, doctor?--have you got into disgrace with\r\nthe populace?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; give me some drink--some water, I am very faint--very faint."\r\n\r\n"Give him some wine, or, what\'s better, some grog," said the admiral.\r\n"Why, he\'s been yard-arm with some pirate or other, and he\'s damaged\r\nabout the figure-head. You ain\'t hurt in your lower works, are you,\r\ndoctor?" said the admiral.\r\n\r\nBut the doctor took no notice of the inquiry; but eagerly sipped the\r\ncontents of a glass that Charles Holland had poured out of a bottle\r\ncontaining some strong Hollands, and which appeared to nerve him much.\r\n\r\n"There!" said the admiral, "that will do you good. How did all this\r\ndamage to your upper works come about, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Let him wash his face and hands first; he will be better able to talk\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you," said Chillingworth. "I am much better; but I have had\r\nsome hard bruises."\r\n\r\n"How did it happen?"\r\n\r\n"I went by myself to watch in the room where the picture was in\r\nBannerworth Hall."\r\n\r\n"Where the picture was!" said Henry; "where it is, you mean, do you not,\r\ndoctor?"\r\n\r\n"No; where it was, and where it is not now."\r\n\r\n"Gone!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, gone away; I\'ll tell you all about it. I went there to watch, but\r\nfound nobody or nothing there; but suddenly a man stepped out from\r\nbehind the picture, and we had a fight over it; after which, just as I\r\nwas getting the worst of it, Jack Pringle came in."\r\n\r\n"The dog!" muttered the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came in just in time, I believe, to save my life; for the man,\r\nwhoever he was, would not have hesitated about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, Jack is a good man," said the admiral; "there may be worse, at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"Well, we had a desperate encounter for some minutes, during which this\r\nfellow wanted to carry off the picture."\r\n\r\n"Carry off the picture?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; we had a struggle for that; but we could not capture him; he was\r\nso violent that he broke away and got clear off."\r\n\r\n"With the picture?"\r\n\r\n"No, he left the picture behind. Well, we were very tired and bruised,\r\nand we sat down to recover ourselves from our fatigue, and to consider\r\nwhat was best to be done; but we were some time before we could leave,\r\nand then we determined that we would take the picture away with us, as\r\nit seemed to be coveted by the robber, for what object we cannot tell."\r\n\r\n"Well, well--where is the picture?"\r\n\r\n"You shall hear all about it in a minute, if you\'ll let me take my time.\r\nI am tired and sore. Well, we brought the picture out, and Jack helped\r\nme carry it till he came within a couple of hundred yards of the\r\ncottage, and there left me."\r\n\r\n"The lubber!" said the admiral, interjectionally.\r\n\r\n"Well, I rested awhile, and then taking the picture on my shoulders, I\r\nproceeded along with it until I came to the wall, when suddenly I heard\r\na great shout, and then down came something heavy upon me, just as if a\r\nman had jumped down upon me."\r\n\r\n"And--and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor, "it was--"\r\n\r\n"Was what?" inquired the admiral.\r\n\r\n"Just what you all seemed to anticipate; you are all before me, but that\r\nwas it."\r\n\r\n"A man?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I had a struggle with him, and got nearly killed, for I am not\r\nequal to him in strength. I was sadly knocked about, and finally all the\r\nsenses were knocked out of me, and I was, I suppose, left for dead."\r\n\r\n"And what became of the picture?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but I suppose it was taken away, as, when I came to\r\nmyself, it was gone; indeed, I have some faint recollection of seeing\r\nhim seize the portrait as I was falling."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some moments, during which all the party appeared\r\nto be employed with their own thoughts, and the whole were silent.\r\n\r\n"Do you think it was the same man who attacked you in the house that\r\nobtained the picture?" at last inquired Henry Bannerworth.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say, but I think it most probable that it was the same;\r\nindeed, the general appearance, as near as I could tell in the dark, was\r\nthe same; but what I look upon as much stronger is, the object appears\r\nto be the same in both cases."\r\n\r\n"That is very true," said Henry Bannerworth--"very true; and I think it\r\nmore than probable myself. But come, doctor, you will require rest and\r\nnursing after your dangers."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ALARM AT ANDERBURY.--THE SUSPICIONS OF THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY, AND\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles to the southward of Bannerworth Hall was a good-sized\r\nmarket-town, called Anderbury. It was an extensive and flourishing\r\nplace, and from the beauty of its situation, and its contiguity to the\r\nsouthern coast of England, it was much admired; and, in consequence,\r\nnumerous mansions and villas of great pretension had sprang up in its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBetides, there were some estates of great value, and one of these,\r\ncalled Anderbury-on-the-Mount, in consequence of the mansion itself,\r\nwhich was of an immense extent, being built upon an eminence, was to be\r\nlet, or sold.\r\n\r\nThis town of Anderbury was remarkable not only for the beauty of its\r\naspect, but likewise for the quiet serenity of its inhabitants, who were\r\na prosperous, thriving race, and depended very much upon their own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThere were some peculiar circumstances why Anderbury-on-the-Mount was to\r\nlet. It had been for a great number of years in possession of a family\r\nof the name of Milltown, who had resided there in great comfort and\r\nrespectability, until an epidemic disorder broke out, first among the\r\nservants, and then spreading to the junior branches of the family, and\r\nfrom them to their seniors, produced such devastation, that in the\r\ncourse of three weeks there was but one young man left of the whole\r\nfamily, and he, by native vigour of constitution, had baffled the\r\ndisorder, and found himself alone in his ancestral halls, the last of\r\nhis race.\r\n\r\nSoon a settled melancholy took possession of him, and all that had\r\nformerly delighted him now gave him pain, inasmuch as it brought to his\r\nmind a host of recollections of the most agonising character.\r\n\r\nIn vain was it that the surrounding gentry paid him every possible\r\nattention, and endeavoured to do all that was in their power to\r\nalleviate the unhappy circumstances in which he was placed. If he\r\nsmiled, it was in a sad sort, and that was very seldom; and at length he\r\nannounced his intention of leaving the neighbourhood, and seeking\r\nabroad, and in change of scene, for that solace which he could not\r\nexpect to find in his ancestral home, after what had occurred within its\r\nancient walls.\r\n\r\nThere was not a chamber but which reminded him of the past--there was\r\nnot a tree or a plant of any kind or description but which spoke to him\r\nplainly of those who were now no more, and whose merry laughter had\r\nwithin his own memory made that ancient place echo with glee, filling\r\nthe sunny air with the most gladsome shouts, such as come from the lips\r\nof happy youth long before the world has robbed it of any of its romance\r\nor its beauty.\r\n\r\nThere was a general feeling of regret when this young man announced the\r\nfact of his departure to a foreign land; for he was much respected, and\r\nthe known calamities which he had suffered, and the grief under which he\r\nlaboured, invested his character with a great and painful interest.\r\n\r\nAn entertainment was given to him upon the eve of his departure, and on\r\nthe next day he was many miles from the place, and the estate of\r\nAnderbury-on-the-Mount was understood to be sold or let.\r\n\r\nThe old mansion had remained, then, for a year or two vacant, for it was\r\na place of too much magnitude, and required by far too expensive an\r\nestablishment to keep it going, to enable any person whose means were\r\nnot very large to think of having anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nSo, therefore, it remained unlet, and wearing that gloomy aspect which a\r\nlarge house, untenanted, so very quickly assumes.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a melancholy thing to look upon it, and to think what it\r\nmust have once been, and what it might be still, compared to what it\r\nactually was; and the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had made up their\r\nminds that Anderbury-on-the-Mount would remain untenanted for many a\r\nyear to come, and, perhaps, ultimately fall into ruin and decay.\r\n\r\nBut in this they were doomed to be disappointed, for, on the evening of\r\na dull and gloomy day, about one week after the events we have recorded\r\nas taking place at Bannerworth Hall and its immediate neighbourhood, a\r\ntravelling carriage, with four horses and an out-rider, came dashing\r\ninto the place, and drew up at the principal inn in the town, which was\r\ncalled the Anderbury Arms.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of such an equipage, although not the most unusual thing\r\nin the world, in consequence of the many aristocratic families who\r\nresided in the neighbourhood, caused, at all events, some sensation,\r\nand, perhaps, the more so because it drove up to the inn instead of to\r\nany of the mansions of the neighbourhood, thereby showing that the\r\nstranger, whoever he was, came not as a visitor, but either merely\r\nbaited in the town, being on his road somewhere else, or had some\r\nspecial business in it which would soon be learned.\r\n\r\nThe out-rider, who was in handsome livery, had gallopped on in advance\r\nof the carriage a short distance, for the purpose of ordering the best\r\napartments in the inn to be immediately prepared for the reception of\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" asked the landlord.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Baron Stolmuyer Saltsburgh."\r\n\r\n"Bless my heart, I never heard of him before; where did he come\r\nfrom--somewhere abroad I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you anything of him further than that he is immensely\r\nrich, and is looking for a house. He has heard that there is one to let\r\nin this immediate neighbourhood, and that\'s what has brought him from\r\nLondon, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is one; and it is called Anderbury-on-the-Mount."\r\n\r\n"Well, he will very likely speak to you about it himself, for here he\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\nBy this time the carriage had halted at the door of the hotel, and, the\r\ndoor being opened, and the steps lowered, there alighted from it a tall\r\nman attired in a kind of pelisse, or cloak, trimmed with rich fur, the\r\nbody of it being composed of velvet. Upon his head he wore a travelling\r\ncap, and his fingers, as he grasped the cloak around him, were seen to\r\nbe covered with rings of great value.\r\n\r\nSuch a personage, coming in such style, was, of course, likely to be\r\nhonoured in every possible way by the landlord of the inn, and\r\naccordingly he was shown most obsequiously to the handsomest apartment\r\nin the house, and the whole establishment was put upon the alert to\r\nattend to any orders he might choose to give.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long in the place when he sent for the landlord, who,\r\nhastily scrambling on his best coat, and getting his wife to arrange the\r\ntie of his neckcloth, proceeded to obey the orders of his illustrious\r\nguest, whatever they might chance to be.\r\n\r\nHe found the Baron Stolmuyer reclining upon a sofa, and having thrown\r\naside his velvet cloak, trimmed with rich fur, he showed that underneath\r\nit he wore a costume of great richness and beauty, although, certainly,\r\nthe form it covered was not calculated to set it off to any great\r\nadvantage, for the baron was merely skin and bone, and looked like a man\r\nwho had just emerged from a long illness, for his face was ghastly pale,\r\nand the landlord could not help observing that there was a strange\r\npeculiarity about his eyes, the reason of which he could not make out.\r\n\r\n"You are the landlord of this inn, I presume," said the baron, "and,\r\nconsequently, no doubt well acquainted with the neighbourhood?"\r\n\r\n"I have the honour to be all that, sir. I have been here about sixteen\r\nyears, and in that time I certainly ought to know something of the\r\nneighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well; some one told me there was a little cottage sort of place to\r\nlet here, and as I am simple and retired in my habits I thought that it\r\nmight possibly suit me."\r\n\r\n"A little cottage, sir! There are certainly little cottages to let, but\r\nnot such as would suit you; and if I might have presumed, sir, to think,\r\nI should have considered Anderbury-on-the-Mount, which is now to let,\r\nwould have been the place for you. It is a large place, sir, and\r\nbelonged to a good family, although they are now all dead and gone,\r\nexcept one, and it\'s he who wants to let the old place."\r\n\r\n"Anderbury-on-the-Mount," said the baron, "was the name of the place\r\nmentioned to me; but I understood it was a little place."\r\n\r\n"Oh! sir, that is quite a mistake; who told you so? It\'s the largest\r\nplace about here; there are a matter of twenty-seven rooms in it, and it\r\nstands altogether upon three hundred acres of ground."\r\n\r\n"And have you the assurance," said the baron, "to call that anything but\r\na cottage, when the castle of the Stolmuyers, at Saltzburgh, has one\r\nsuite of reception rooms thirty in number, opening into each other, and\r\nthe total number of apartments in the whole building is two hundred\r\nand sixty, it is surrounded by eight miles of territory."\r\n\r\n"The devil!" said the landlord. "I beg your pardon, sir, but when I am\r\nastonished, I generally say the devil. They want eight hundred pounds a\r\nyear for Anderbury-on-the-Mount."\r\n\r\n"A mere trifle. I will sleep here to-night, and in the morning I will go\r\nand look at the place. It is near the sea?"\r\n\r\n"Half a mile, sir, exactly, from the beach; and one of the most curious\r\ncircumstances of all connected with it is, that there is a subterranean\r\npassage from the grounds leading right away down to the sea-coast. A\r\nmost curious place, sir, partly cut out of the cliff, with cellars in it\r\nfor wine, and other matters, that in the height of summer are kept as\r\ncool as in the deep winter time. It\'s more for curiosity than use, such\r\na place; and the old couple, that now take care of the house, make a\r\npretty penny, I\'ll be bound, though they won\'t own it, by showing that\r\npart of the place."\r\n\r\n"It may suit me, but I shall be able to give a decisive answer when I\r\nsee it on the morrow. You will let my attendants have what they require,\r\nand see that my horses be well looked to."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, oh! certainly, sir, of course; you might go far, indeed,\r\nsir, before you found an inn where everything would be done as things\r\nare done here. Is there anything in particular, sir, you would like for\r\ndinner?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell that, idiot, until the dinner time arrives?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but, sir, in that case, you know, we scarcely know what to do,\r\nbecause you see, sir, you understand--"\r\n\r\n"It is very strange to me that you can neither see nor understand your\r\nduty. I am accustomed to having the dinner tables spread with all that\r\nmoney can procure; then I choose, but not before, what it suits me to\r\npartake of."\r\n\r\n"Wil, sir, that is a very good way, and perhaps we ain\'t quite so used\r\nto that sort of thing as we ought to be in these parts; but another\r\ntime, sir, we shall know better what we are about, without a doubt, and\r\nI only hope, sir, that we shall have you in the neighbourhood for a long\r\ntime; and so, sir, putting one thing to another, and then drawing a\r\nconclusion from both of them, you see, sir, you will be able to\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"Peace! begone! what is the use of all this bellowing to me--I want it\r\nnot--I care not for it."\r\n\r\nThe baron spoke these words so furiously, that the landlord was rather\r\nterrified than otherwise, and left the room hastily, muttering to\r\nhimself that he had never come across such a tiger, and wondering where\r\nthe baron could have possibly come from, and what amount of wealth he\r\ncould be possessed of, that would enable him to live in such a princely\r\nstyle as he mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had wished ever so much to impress\r\nupon the minds of all persons in the neighbourhood the fact of his\r\nwealth and importance, he could not have adopted a better plan to\r\naccomplish that object than by first of all impressing such facts upon\r\nthe mind of the landlord of the Anderbury Arms, for in the course of\r\nanother hour it was tolerably well spread all over the town, that never\r\nhad there been such a guest at the Anderbury Arms; and that he called\r\nAnderbury-on-the-Mount, with all its rooms--all its outbuildings, and\r\nits three hundred acres of ground, a cottage.\r\n\r\nThis news spread like wildfire, awaking no end of speculation, and\r\ngiving rise to the most exaggerated rumours, so that a number of persons\r\ncame to the inn on purpose to endeavour to get a look at the baron; but\r\nhe did not stir from his apartments, so that these wondermongers were\r\ndisappointed, and even forced to go away as wise as they came; but in\r\nthe majority of cases they made up their minds that in the morning they\r\nshould surely be able to obtain a glimpse of him, which was considered a\r\ngreat treat, for a man with an immense income is looked upon in England\r\nas a natural curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe landlord took his guest at his word as regards the dinner, and\r\nprovided such a repast as seldom, indeed, graced the board at the\r\nAnderbury Arms--a repast sufficient for twenty people, and certainly\r\nwhich was a monstrous thing to set before one individual.\r\n\r\nThe baron, however, made no remark, but selected a portion from some of\r\nthe dishes, and those dishes that he did select from, were of the\r\nsimplest kind, and not such as the landlord expected him to take, so\r\nthat he really paid about one hundred times the amount he ought to have\r\ndone for what actually passed his lips.\r\n\r\nAnd then what a fidget the landlord was in about his wines, for he\r\ndoubted not but such a guest would be extremely critical and hard to\r\nplease; but, to his great relief, the baron declined taking any wine,\r\nmerely washing down his repast with a tumbler of cool water; and then,\r\nalthough the hour was very early, he retired at once to rest.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was not disposed to disregard the injunction which the\r\nbaron had given him to attend carefully on his servants and horses, and\r\nafter giving orders that nothing should be stinted as regarded the\r\nlatter, he himself looked to the creature-comforts of the former, and he\r\ndid this with a double motive, for not only was he anxious to make the\r\nmost he could out of the baron in the way of charges, but he was\r\npositively panting with curiosity to know more about so singular a\r\npersonage, and he thought that surely the servants must be able to\r\nfurnish him with some particulars regarding their eccentric master.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was mistaken, for although they told him all they\r\nknew, that amounted to so little as really not to be worth the learning.\r\n\r\nThey informed him that they had been engaged all in the last week, and\r\nthat they knew nothing of the baron whatever, or where he came from, or\r\nwhat he was, excepting that he paid them most liberal wages, and was not\r\nvery exacting in the service he required of them.\r\n\r\nThis was very unsatisfactory, and when the landlord started on a\r\nmission, which he considered himself bound to perform, to a Mr. Leek, in\r\nthe town, who had the letting of Anderbury-on-the-Mount, he was quite\r\nvexed to think what a small amount of information he was able to carry\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"I can tell him," he said to himself as he went quickly towards the\r\nagent\'s residence; "I can tell him the baron\'s name, and that in the\r\nmorning he wants to look at Anderbury-on-the-Mount; but that\'s all I\r\nknow of him, except that he is a most extraordinary man--indeed, the\r\nmost extraordinary that I ever came near."\r\n\r\nMr. Leek, the house agent, notwithstanding the deficiency of the facts\r\ncontained in the landlord\'s statement, was well enough satisfied to hear\r\nthat any one of apparent wealth was inquiring after the large premises\r\nto let, for, as he said truly to the landlord,--\r\n\r\n"The commission on letting and receiving the rentals of such a property\r\nis no joke to me."\r\n\r\n"Precisely," said the landlord. "I thought it was better to come and\r\ntell you at once, for there can be no doubt that he is enormously rich."\r\n\r\n"If that be satisfactorily proved, it\'s of no consequence what he is, or\r\nwho he is, and you may depend I shall be round to the inn early in the\r\nmorning to attend upon him; and in that case, perhaps, if you have any\r\nconversation with him, you will be so good as to mention that I will\r\nshow him over the premises at his own hour, and you shall not be\r\nforgotten, you may depend, if any arrangement is actually come to. It\r\nwill be just as well for you to tell him what a nice property it is, and\r\nthat it is to be let for eight hundred a year, or sold outright for\r\neight thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"I will, you may depend, Mr. Leek. A most extraordinary man you will\r\nfind him; not the handsomest in the world, I can tell you, but handsome\r\nis as handsome does, say I; and, if he takes Anderbury-on-the-Mount, I\r\nhave no doubt but he will spend a lot of money in the neighbourhood, and\r\nwe shall all be the better of that, of course, as you well know, sir."\r\n\r\nThis then was thoroughly agreed upon between these high contracting\r\npowers, and the landlord returned home very well satisfied, indeed, with\r\nthe position in which he had put the affair, and resolved upon urging on\r\nthe baron, as far as it lay within his power so to do, to establish\r\nhimself in the neighbourhood, and to allow him to be purveyor-in-general\r\nto his household, which, if the baron continued in his liberal humour,\r\nwould be unquestionably a very pleasant post to occupy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV.\r\n\r\nTHE VISITOR, AND THE DEATH IN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbout an hour and a half after the baron had retired to rest, and while\r\nthe landlord was still creeping about enjoining silence on the part of\r\nthe establishment, so that the slumbers of a wealthy and, no doubt,\r\nillustrious personage should not be disturbed, there arrived a horseman\r\nat the Anderbury Arms.\r\n\r\nHe was rather a singular-looking man, with a shifting, uneasy-looking\r\nglance, as if he were afraid of being suddenly pounced upon and\r\nsurprised by some one; and although his apparel was plain, yet it was\r\ngood in quality, and his whole appearance was such as to induce\r\nrespectful attention.\r\n\r\nThe only singular circumstance was, that such a traveller, so well\r\nmounted, should be alone; but that might have been his own fancy, so\r\nthat the absence of an attendant went for nothing. Doubtless, if the\r\nwhole inn had not been in such a commotion about the illustrious and\r\nwealthy baron, this stranger would have received more consideration and\r\nattention than he did.\r\n\r\nUpon alighting, he walked at once into what is called the coffee-room of\r\nthe hotel, and after ordering some refreshments, of which he partook but\r\nsparingly, he said, in a mild but solemn sort of tone, to the waiter who\r\nattended upon him,--\r\n\r\n"Tell the Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh, that there is one here who\r\nwants to see him."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, sir," said the waiter, "but the baron is gone to\r\nbed."\r\n\r\n"It matters not to me. If you nor no one else in this establishment will\r\ndeliver the message I charge you with, I must do so myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll speak to my master, sir; but the baron is a very great gentleman\r\nindeed, and I don\'t think my master would like to have him disturbed."\r\n\r\nThe stranger hesitated for a time, and then he said,--\r\n\r\n"Show me the baron\'s apartment. Perhaps I ought not to ask any one\r\nperson connected with this establishment to disturb him, when I am quite\r\nwilling to do so myself. Show me the way."\r\n\r\n"Well, but, sir, the baron may get in a rage, and say, very naturally,\r\nthat we had no business to let anybody walk up to his room and disturb\r\nhim, because we wouldn\'t do so ourselves. So that you see, sir, when you\r\ncome to consider, it hardly seems the right sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Since," said the stranger, rising, "I cannot procure even the common\r\ncourtesy of being shown to the apartment of the person whom I seek, I\r\nmust find him myself."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he walked out of the room, and began ascending the\r\nstaircase, despite the remonstrances of the waiter, who called after him\r\nrepeatedly, but could not induce him to stop; and when he found that\r\nsuch was the case, he made his way to the landlord, to give the alarm\r\nthat, for all he knew to the contrary, some one had gone up stairs to\r\nmurder the baron.\r\n\r\nThis information threw the landlord into such a fix, that he knew not\r\nwhat to be at. At one moment he was for rushing up stairs and\r\nendeavouring to interfere, and at another he thought the best plan would\r\nbe to pretend that he knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this state of uncertainty, the stranger succeeded in\r\nmaking his way up stairs to the floor from which proceeded the bedrooms,\r\nand, apparently, having no fear whatever of the Baron Stolmuyer\'s\r\nindignation before his eyes, he opened door after door, until he came to\r\none which led him into the apartment occupied by that illustrious\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe baron, half undressed only, lay in an uneasy slumber upon the bed,\r\nand the stranger stood opposite to him for some minutes, as if\r\nconsidering what he should do.\r\n\r\n"It would be easy," he said, "to kill him; but it will pay me better to\r\nspare him. I may be wrong in supposing that he has the means which I\r\nhope he has; but that I shall soon discover by his conversation."\r\n\r\nStretching out, his hand, he tapped the baron lightly on the shoulder,\r\nwho thereupon opened his eyes and sprang to his feet instantly, glancing\r\nwith fixed earnestness at the intruder, upon whose face shone the light\r\nof a lamp which was burning in the apartment.\r\n\r\nThen the baron shrunk back, and the stranger, folding his arms, said,--\r\n\r\n"You know me. Let our interview be as brief as possible. There needs no\r\nexplanations between us, for we both know all that could be said. By\r\nsome accident you have become rich, while I continue quite otherwise. It\r\nmatters not how this has occurred, the fact is everything. I don\'t know\r\nthe amount of your possessions; but, from your style of living, they\r\nmust be great, and therefore it is that I make no hesitation in asking\r\nof you, as a price for not exposing who and what you are, a moderate\r\nsum."\r\n\r\n"I thought that you were dead."\r\n\r\n"I know you did; but you behold me here, and, consequently, that\r\ndelusion vanishes."\r\n\r\n"What sum do you require, and what assurance can I have that, when you\r\nget it, the demand will not be repeated on the first opportunity?"\r\n\r\n"I can give you no such assurance, perhaps, that would satisfy you\r\nentirely; but, for more reasons than I choose to enter into, I am\r\nextremely anxious to leave England at once and forever. Give me the\r\npower to do so that I require, and you will never hear of me again."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe baron hesitated for some few seconds, during which he looked\r\nscrutinizingly at his companion, and then he said, in a tone of voice\r\nthat seemed as if he were making the remark to himself rather than to\r\nthe other,--\r\n\r\n"You look no older than you did when last we parted, and that was years\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"Why should I look older? You know as well as I that I need not. But, to\r\nbe brief, I do not wish to interfere with any plans or projects you may\r\nhave on hand. I do not wish to be a hindrance to you. Let me have five\r\nthousand pounds, and I am off at once and forever, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"Five thousand! the man raves--five thousand pounds! Say one thousand,\r\nand it is yours."\r\n\r\n"No; I have fixed my price; and if you do not consent, I now tell you\r\nthat I will blazon forth, even in this house, who and what you are; and,\r\nlet your schemes of ambition or of cupidity be what they may, you may be\r\nassured that I will blast them all."\r\n\r\n"This is no place in which to argue such a point; come out into the open\r\nair; \'walls have ears;\' but come out, and I will give you such special\r\nreasons why you should not now press your claim at all, that you shall\r\nfeel much beholden to me for them, and not regret your visit."\r\n\r\n"If that we come to terms, I no more desire than you can do that any one\r\nshould overhear our conversation. I prefer the open air for any\r\nconference, be it whatever it may--much prefer it; and therefore most\r\nwillingly embrace your proposition. Come out."\r\n\r\nThe baron put on his travelling cap, and the rich velvet cloak, edged\r\nwith fur, that he possessed, and leaving his chamber a few paces in\r\nadvance of his strange visitor, he descended the staircase, followed by\r\nhim. In the hall of the hotel they found the landlord and almost the\r\nwhole of the establishment assembled, in deep consultation as to whether\r\nor not any one was to go up stairs and ascertain if the stranger who had\r\nsought the baron\'s chamber was really a friend or an enemy.\r\n\r\nBut when they saw the two men coming down, at all events apparently\r\namicably, it was a great relief, and the landlord rushed forward and\r\nopened the door, for which piece of service he got a very stately bow\r\nfrom the baron, and a slight inclination of the head from his visitor,\r\nand then they both passed out.\r\n\r\n"I have ascertained," said the man who came on horseback, "that for the\r\nlast week in London you have lived in a style of the most princely\r\nmagnificence, and that you came down here, attended as if you were one\r\nof the first nobles of the land."\r\n\r\n"These things amuse the vulgar," said the baron. "I do not mind\r\nadmitting to you that I contemplate residing on this spot, and perhaps\r\ncontracting a marriage."\r\n\r\n"Another marriage?"\r\n\r\n"And why not? If wives will die suddenly, and no one knows why, who is\r\nto help it. I do not pretend to control the fates."\r\n\r\n"This, between us, is idle talk indeed--most idle; for we know there are\r\ncertain circumstances which account for the strangest phenomena; but\r\nwhat roaring sound is that which comes so regularly and steadily upon\r\nthe ear."\r\n\r\n"It is the sea washing upon the coast. The tide is no doubt advancing,\r\nand, as the eddying surges roll in upon the pebbly shore, they make\r\nwhat, to my mind, is this pleasant music."\r\n\r\n"I did not think we were so near the ocean. The moon is rising; let us\r\nwalk upon the beach, and as that sound is such pleasant music, you shall\r\nhear it while I convince you what unpleasant consequences will arise\r\nfrom a refusal of the modest and moderate terms I offer you."\r\n\r\n"We shall see, we shall see; but I must confess it does seem to me most\r\nextraordinary that you ask of me a positive fortune, for fear you should\r\ndeprive me of a portion of one; but you cannot mean what you say."\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking they reached a long strip of sand which was by\r\nthe seashore, at the base of some cliffs, through which was excavated\r\nthe passage from the coast into the grounds of Anderbury House, and\r\nwhich had been so expatiated upon by the landlord of the inn, in his\r\ndescription of the advantages attendant upon that property.\r\n\r\nThere were some rude steps, leading to a narrow arched door-way, which\r\nconstituted an entrance to this subterraneous region; and as the\r\nmoonlight streamed over the wide waste of waters, and fell upon this\r\nlittle door-way in the face of the cliff, he became convinced that it\r\nwas the entrance to that excavation, and he eyed it curiously.\r\n\r\n"What place is that?" said his companion.\r\n\r\n"It is a private entrance to the grounds of a mansion in this\r\nneighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"Private enough, I should presume; for if there be any other means of\r\nreaching the house, surely no one would go through such a dismal hole as\r\nthat towards it; but come, make up your mind at once. There need be no\r\nquarrelling upon the subject of our conference, but let it be a plain\r\nmatter of yes or no. Is it worth your while to be left alone in peace,\r\nor is it not?"\r\n\r\n"It is worth my while, but not at such a price as that you mentioned;\r\nand I cannot help thinking that some cheaper mode of accomplishing the\r\nsame object will surely present itself very shortly."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you; you talk ambiguously."\r\n\r\n"But my acts," said the baron, "shall be clear and plain enough, as you\r\nshall see. Could you believe it possible that I was the sort of person\r\nto submit tamely to any amount of extortion you chose to practise upon\r\nme. There was a time when I thought you possessed great sense and\r\njudgment when I thought that you were a man who weighed well the chances\r\nof what you were about; but now I know to the contrary; and I think for\r\nless than a thousand pounds I may succeed in ridding myself of you."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you; you had better beware how you tamper with me,\r\nfor I am not one who will be calmly disposed to put up with much. The\r\nsense, tact, and worldly knowledge which you say you have before, from\r\ntime to time, given me credit for, belongs to me still, and I am not\r\nlikely easily to commit myself."\r\n\r\n"Indeed; do you think you bear such a charmed life that nothing can\r\nshake it?"\r\n\r\n"I think nothing of the sort; but I know what I can do--I am armed."\r\n\r\n"And I; and since it comes to this, take the reward of your villany; for\r\nit was you who made me what I am, and would now seek to destroy my every\r\nhope of satisfaction."\r\n\r\nAs the baron spoke he drew from his breast a small pistol, which, with\r\nthe quickness of thought, he held full in the face of his companion, and\r\npulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt on earth that his intention was to commit the\r\nmurder, but the pistol missed fire, and he was defeated in his intention\r\nat that moment. Then the stranger laughed scornfully, and drawing a\r\npistol from his pocket, he presented it at the baron\'s head, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Do I not bear a charmed life? If I had not, should I have escaped death\r\nfrom you now? No, I could not; but you perceive that even a weapon that\r\nmight not fail you upon another occasion is harmless against me; and can\r\nyou expect that I will hesitate now to take full and ample revenge upon\r\nyou for this dastardly attempt?"\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken with great volubility, so much so, indeed, that\r\nthey only occupied a few very brief seconds in delivering; and then,\r\nperhaps, the baron\'s career might have ended, for it seemed to be fully\r\nthe intention of the other to conclude what he said by firing the pistol\r\nin his face; but the wily aspect of the baron\'s countenance was, after\r\nall, but a fair index of the mind, and, just as the last words passed\r\nthe lips of his irritated companion, he suddenly dropped in a crouching\r\nposition to the ground, and, seizing his legs, threw him over his head\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\nThe pistol was discharged, at the same moment, and then, with a shout of\r\nrage and satisfaction, the baron sprang upon his foe, and, kneeling upon\r\nhis breast, he held aloft in his hand a glittering dagger, the\r\nhighly-polished blade of which caught the moonbeams, and reflected them\r\ninto the dazzled eyes of the conquered man, whose fate now appeared to\r\nbe certain.\r\n\r\n"Fool!" said the baron, "you must needs, then, try conclusions with me,\r\nand, not content with the safety of insignificance, you must be absurd\r\nenough to think it possible you could extort from me whatever sums your\r\nfancy dictated, or with any effect threaten me, if I complied not with\r\nyour desires."\r\n\r\n"Have mercy upon me. I meant not to take your life; and, therefore, why\r\nshould you take mine?"\r\n\r\n"You would have taken it, and, therefore, you shall die. Know, too, as\r\nthis is your last moment, that, vampyre as you are, and as I, of all\r\nmen, best know you to be, I will take especial care that you shall be\r\nplaced in some position after death where the revivifying moonbeams may\r\nnot touch you, so that this shall truly be your end, and you shall rot\r\naway, leaving no trace behind of your existence, sufficient to contain\r\nthe vital principle."\r\n\r\n"No--no! you cannot--will not. You will have mercy."\r\n\r\n"Ask the famished tiger for mercy, when you intrude upon his den."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the baron ground his teeth together with rage, and, in an\r\ninstant, buried the poniard in the throat of his victim. The blade went\r\nthrough to the yellow sand beneath, and the murderer still knelt upon\r\nthe man\'s chest, while he who had thus received so fatal a blow tossed\r\nhis arms about with agony, and tried in vain to shriek.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the wound, however, prevented him from uttering anything\r\nbut a low gurgling sound, for he was nearly choked with his own blood,\r\nand soon his eyes became fixed and of a glassy appearance; he stretched\r\nout his two arms, and dug his fingers deep into the sand.\r\n\r\nThe baron drew forth the poniard, and a gush of blood immediately\r\nfollowed it, and then one deep groan testified to the fact, that the\r\nspirit, if there be a spirit, had left its mortal habitation, and winged\r\nits flight to other realms, if there be other realms for it to wing its\r\nflight to.\r\n\r\n"He is dead," said the baron, and, at the same moment, a roll of the\r\nadvancing tide swept over the body, drenching the living, as well as the\r\ndead, with the brine of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe baron stooped and rinsed the dagger in the advancing tide from the\r\nclotted blood which had clung to it, and then, wiping it carefully, he\r\nreturned it to its sheath, which was hidden within the folds of his\r\ndress; and, rising from his kneeling posture upon the body, he stood by\r\nits side, with folded arms, gazing upon it, for some minutes, in\r\nsilence, heedless of the still advancing water, which was already\r\nconsiderably above his feet.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke in his ordinary accents, and evidently caring nothing for\r\nthe fact that he had done such a deed.\r\n\r\n"I must dispose of this carcase," he said, "which now seems so lifeless,\r\nfor the moon is up, and if its beams fall upon it, I know, from former\r\nexperience, what will happen; it will rise again, and walk the earth,\r\nseeking for vengeance upon me, and the thirst for that vengeance will\r\nbecome such a part of its very nature, that it will surely accomplish\r\nsomething, if not all that it desires."\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments\' consideration, he stooped, and, with more strength\r\nthan one would have thought it possible a man reduced almost, as he was,\r\nto a skeleton could have exerted, he lifted the body, and carried it\r\nrapidly up the beach towards the cliffs. He threw it down upon the stone\r\nsteps that led to the small door of the excavation in the cliff, and it\r\nfell upon them with a sickening sound, as if some of the bones were\r\nsurely broken by the fall.\r\n\r\nThe object, then, of the baron seemed to be to get this door open, if he\r\npossibly could; but that was an object easier to be desired than carried\r\ninto effect, for, although he exerted his utmost power, he did not\r\nsucceed in moving it an inch, and he began evidently to think that it\r\nwould be impossible to do so.\r\n\r\nBut yet he did not give up the attempt at once, but looking about upon\r\nthe beach, until he found a large heavy stone, he raised it in his arms,\r\nand, approaching the door, he flung it against it with such tremendous\r\nforce, that it flew open instantly, disclosing within a dark and narrow\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nApparently rejoiced that he had accomplished this much, he stopped\r\ncautiously within the entrance, and then, taking from a concealed pocket\r\nthat was in the velvet cloak which he wore a little box, he produced\r\nfrom it some wax-lights and some chemical matches, which, by the\r\nslightest effort, he succeeded in igniting, and then, with one of the\r\nlights in his hand to guide him on his way, he went on exploring the\r\npassage, and treading with extreme caution as he went, for fear of\r\nfalling into any of the ice-wells which were reported to be in that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding about twenty yards, and finding that there was no\r\ndanger, he became less cautious; but, in consequence of such less\r\ncaution, he very nearly sacrificed his life, for he came upon an\r\nice-well which seemed a considerable depth, and into which he had nearly\r\nplunged headlong.\r\n\r\nHe started back with some degree of horror; but that soon left him, and\r\nthen, after a moment\'s thought, he sought for some little nook in the\r\nwall, in which he might place the candle, and soon finding one that\r\nanswered the purpose well, he there left it, having all the appearance\r\nof a little shrine, while he proceeded again to the mouth of that\r\nsingular and cavernous-looking place. He had, evidently, quite made up\r\nhis mind what to do, for, without a moment\'s hesitation, he lifted the\r\nbody again, and carried it within the entrance, walking boldly and\r\nfirmly, now that he knew there was no danger between him and the light,\r\nwhich shed a gleam through the darkness of the place of a very faint and\r\nflickering character.\r\n\r\nHe reached it rapidly, and when he got to the side of the well, he,\r\nwithout a moment\'s hesitation, flung it headlong down, and, listening\r\nattentively, he heard it fall with a slight plash, as if there was some\r\nwater at the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\nIt was an annoyance, however, for him to find that the distance was not\r\nso deep as he had anticipated, and when he took the light from the niche\r\nwhere he had placed it, and looked earnestly down, he could see the\r\nlivid, ghastly-looking face of the dead man, for the body had\r\naccidentally fallen upon its back, which was a circumstance he had not\r\ncounted upon, and one which increased the chances greatly of its being\r\nseen, should any one be exploring, from curiosity, that not very\r\ninviting place.\r\n\r\nThis was annoyance, but how could it be prevented, unless, indeed, he\r\nchose to descend, and make an alteration in the disposition of the\r\ncorpse? But this was evidently what he did not choose to do; so, after\r\nmuttering to himself a few words expressive of his intention to leave it\r\nwhere it was, he replaced the candle, after extinguishing it, in the box\r\nfrom whence he had taken it, and carefully walked out of the dismal\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe moonbeams were shining very brightly and beautifully upon the face\r\nof the cliffs, when he emerged from the subterranean passage, so that he\r\ncould see the door, the steps, and every object quite distinctly; and,\r\nto his gratification, he found that he had not destroyed any fastening\r\nthat was to the door, but that when it was slammed shut, it struck so\r\nhard and fast, that the strength of one man could not possibly move it,\r\neven the smallest fraction of an inch.\r\n\r\n"I shall be shown all this to-morrow," he said; "and if I take this\r\nhouse I must have an alteration made in this door, so that it may open\r\nwith a lock, instead of by main violence, as at present; but if, in the\r\nmorning, when I view Anderbury House, I can avoid an entrance into this\r\nregion, I will do so, and at my leisure, if I become the possessor of\r\nthe estate, I can explore every nook and cranny of it."\r\n\r\nHe then folded his cloak about him, after pulling the door as closely as\r\nhe could. He walked slowly and thoughtfully back to the inn. It was\r\nquite evident that the idea of the murder he had committed did not annoy\r\nhim in the least, and that in his speculations upon the subject he\r\ncongratulated himself much upon having so far succeeded in getting rid\r\nof certainly a most troublesome acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well, indeed," he said, "that just at this juncture he should\r\nthrow himself in my way, and enable me so easy to feel certain that I\r\nshall never more be troubled with him. Truly, I ran some risk, and when\r\nmy pistol missed fire, it seemed as if my evil star was in its\r\nascendant, and that I was doomed myself to become the victim of him whom\r\nI have laid in so cold a grave. But I have been victorious, and I am\r\nwilling to accept the circumstance as an omen of the past--that my\r\nfortunes are on the change. I think I shall be successful now, and with\r\nthe ample means which I now possess, surely, in this country, where gold\r\nis loved so well, I shall be able to overcome all difficulties, and to\r\nunite myself to some one, who--but no matter, her fate is an after\r\nconsideration."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV.\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE IN THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY ARRANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter the adventure of the doctor with regard to the picture about which\r\nsuch an air of mystery and interest has been thrown, the Bannerworth\r\nfamily began to give up all hopes of ever finding a clue to those\r\ncircumstances concerning which they would certainly have liked to have\r\nknown the truth, but of which it was not likely they would ever hear\r\nanything more.\r\n\r\nDr. Chillingworth now had no reserve, and when he had recovered\r\nsufficiently to feel that he could converse without an effort, he took\r\nan opportunity, while the whole of the family were present, to speak of\r\nwhat had been his hopes and his expectations.\r\n\r\n"You are all aware," he said, "now, of the story of Marmaduke\r\nBannerworth, and what an excessively troublesome person he was, with all\r\ndeference, to you, Henry; first of all, as to spending all his money at\r\nthe gaming-table, and leaving his family destitute; and then, when he\r\ndid get a lump of money which might have done some good to those he left\r\nbehind him--hiding it somewhere where it could not be found at all, and\r\nso leaving you all in great difficulty and distress, when you might have\r\nbeen independent."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough, doctor," said Henry; "but you know the old\r\nproverb,--that ill-gotten wealth never thrives; so that I don\'t regret\r\nnot finding this money, for I am sure we should have been none the\r\nhappier with it, and perhaps not so happy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother the old proverb; thirty or forty thousand pounds is no\r\ntrifle to be talked lightly of, or the loss of which to be quietly put\r\nup with, on account of a musty proverb. It\'s a large sum, and I should\r\nlike to have placed it in your hands."\r\n\r\n"But as you cannot, doctor, there can be no good possibly done by\r\nregretting it."\r\n\r\n"No, certainly; I don\'t mean that; utter regret is always a very foolish\r\nthing; but it\'s questionable whether something might not be done in the\r\nmatter, after all, for you, as it appears, by all the evidence we can\r\ncollect, that it must have been Varney, after all, who jumped down upon\r\nme from the garden-wall in so sudden a manner: and, if the picture be\r\nvaluable to him, it must be valuable to us."\r\n\r\n"But how are we to get it, and if we could, I do not see that it would\r\nbe of much good to anybody, for, after all, it is but a painting."\r\n\r\n"There you go again," said the doctor, "depreciating what you know\r\nnothing about; now, listen to me, Master Henry, and I will tell you.\r\nThat picture evidently had some sort of lining at the back, over the\r\noriginal canvas; and do you think I would have taken such pains to bring\r\nit away with me if that lining had not made me suspect that between it\r\nand the original picture the money, in bank notes, was deposited?"\r\n\r\n"Had you any special reason for supposing such was the case?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; most unquestionably I had; for when I got the picture fairly down,\r\nI found various inequalities in the surface of the back, which led me to\r\nbelieve that rolls of notes were deposited, and that the great mistake\r\nwe had all along made was in looking behind the picture, instead of at\r\nthe picture itself. I meant immediately to have cut it to pieces when I\r\nreached here with it; but now it has got into the hands of somebody\r\nelse, who knows, I suspect, as much I do."\r\n\r\n"It is rather provoking."\r\n\r\n"Rather provoking! is that the way to talk of the loss of Heaven knows\r\nhow many thousands of pounds! I am quite aggravated myself at the idea\r\nof the thing, and it puts me in a perfect fever to think of it, I can\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\n"But what can we do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I propose an immediate crusade against Varney, the vampyre, for who\r\nbut he could have made such an attack upon me, and force me to deliver\r\nup such a valuable treasure?"\r\n\r\n"Never heed it, doctor," said Flora; "let it go; we have never had or\r\nenjoyed that money, so it cannot matter, and it is not to be considered\r\nas the loss of an actual possession, because we never did actually\r\npossess it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," chimed in the admiral; "bother the money! what do we care about\r\nit; and, besides, Charley Holland is going to be very busy."\r\n\r\n"Busy!" said the doctor, "how do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, isn\'t he going to be married directly to Flora, here, and am not I\r\ngoing to settle the whole of my property upon him on condition that he\r\ntakes the name of Bell instead of Holland? for, you see, his mother was\r\nmy sister, and of course her name was Bell. As for his father Holland,\r\nit can\'t matter to him now what Charley is called; and if he don\'t take\r\nthe name of Bell I shall be the last in the family, for I am not likely\r\nto marry, and have any little Bells about me."\r\n\r\n"No," said the doctor; "I should say not; and that\'s the reason why you\r\nwant to ring the changes upon Charles Holland\'s name. Do you see the\r\njoke, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I do--where is it? It\'s all very well to talk of jokes, but\r\nif I was like Charles, going to be married, I shouldn\'t be in any joking\r\nhumour, I can tell you, but quite the reverse; and as for you and your\r\npicture, if you want it, doctor, just run after Varney yourself for it;\r\nor, stay--I have a better idea than that--get your wife to go and ask\r\nhim for it, and if she makes half such a clamour about his ears that she\r\ndid about ours, he will give it her in a minute, to get rid of her."\r\n\r\n"My wife!--you don\'t mean to say she has been here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but she has though. And now, doctor, I can tell you I have seen a\r\ngood deal of service in all parts of the world, and, of course, picked\r\nup a little experience; and, if I were you, some of these days, when\r\nMrs. Chillingworth ain\'t very well, I\'d give her a composing draught\r\nthat would make her quiet enough."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s not my style of practice, admiral; but I am sorry to hear\r\nthat Mrs. Chillingworth has annoyed you so much."\r\n\r\n"Pho, pho, man!--pho, pho! do you think she could annoy me? Why, I have\r\nencountered storms and squalls in all latitudes, and it isn\'t a woman\'s\r\ntongue now that can do anything of an annoying character, I can tell\r\nyou; far from it--very far from it; so don\'t distress yourself upon that\r\nhead. But come, doctor, we are going to have the wedding the day after\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Flora; "the week after next, you mean,"\r\n\r\n"Is it the week after next? I\'ll be hanged if I didn\'t think it was the\r\nday after to-morrow; but of course you know best, as you have settled it\r\nall among you. I have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I shall, with great pleasure," returned the doctor, "be\r\npresent on the interesting occasion; but do you intend taking possession\r\nof Bannerworth Hall again?"\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not," said Henry; "we propose going to the Dearbrook\r\nestate, and there remaining for a time to see how we all like it. We\r\nmay, perchance, enjoy it very much, for I have heard it spoken of as an\r\nattractive little property enough, and one that any one might fancy,\r\nafter being resident a short time upon it."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the admiral; "that is, I believe, settled among us, but I\r\nam sure we sha\'n\'t like it, on account of the want of the sea. Why, I\r\ntell you, I have not seen a ship myself for this eighteen months;\r\nthere\'s a state of things, you see, that won\'t do to last, because one\r\nwould get dry-mouldy: it\'s a shocking thing to see nothing but land,\r\nland, wherever you go."\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding conversation may be gathered what were the designs of\r\nthe Bannerworth family, and what progress had been made in carrying them\r\nout. From the moment they had discovered the title-deeds of the\r\nDearbrook property, they had ceased to care about the large sum of money\r\nwhich Marmaduke Bannerworth had been supposed to have hidden in some\r\nportion of Bannerworth Hall.\r\n\r\nThey had already passed through quite enough of the busy turmoils of\r\nexistence to be grateful for anything that promised ease and competence,\r\nand that serenity of mind which is the dearest possession which any one\r\ncan compass.\r\n\r\nConsequently was it, that, with one accord, they got rid of all yearning\r\nafter the large sum which the doctor was so anxious to procure for them,\r\nand looked forward to a life of great happiness and contentment. On the\r\nwhole, too, when they came to talk the matter over quietly among\r\nthemselves, they were not sorry that Varney had taken himself off in the\r\nway he had, for really it was a great release; and, as he had couched\r\nhis farewell in words which signified it was a final one, they were\r\ninclined to think that he must have left England, and that it was not\r\nlikely they should ever again encounter him, under any circumstances\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIt was to be considered quite as a whim of the old admiral\'s, the\r\nchanging of Charles Holland\'s name to Bell; but, as Charles himself said\r\nwhen the subject was broached to him,--"I am so well content to be\r\ncalled whatever those to whom I feel affection think proper, that I give\r\nup my name of Holland without a pang, willingly adopting in its stead\r\none that has always been hallowed in my remembrance with the best and\r\nkindest recollections."\r\n\r\nAnd thus this affair was settled, much to the satisfaction of Flora, who\r\nwas quite as well content to be called Mrs. Bell as to be called Mrs.\r\nHolland, since the object of her attachment remained the same. The\r\nwedding was really fixed for the week after that which followed the\r\nconversation we have recorded; but the admiral was not at all disposed\r\nto allow Flora and his nephew Charles to get through such an important\r\nperiod of their lives without some greater demonstration and show than\r\ncould be made from the little cottage where they dwelt; and consequently\r\nhe wished that they should leave that and proceed at once to a larger\r\nmansion, which he had his eye upon a few miles off, and which was to be\r\nhad furnished for a time, at the pleasure of any one.\r\n\r\n"And we won\'t shut ourselves up," said the admiral; "but we will find\r\nout all the Christian-like people in the neighbourhood, and invite them\r\nto the wedding, and we will have a jolly good breakfast together, and\r\nlots of music, and a famous lunch; and, after that, a dinner, and then a\r\ndance, and all that sort of thing; so that there shall be no want of\r\nfun."\r\n\r\nAs may be well supposed, both Charles and Flora shrunk from so public an\r\naffair; but, as the old man had evidently set his heart upon it, they\r\ndid not like to say they positively would not; so, after a vain attempt\r\nto dissuade him from removing at all from the cottage until they removed\r\nfor good, they gave up the point to him, and he had it all his own way.\r\n\r\nHe took the house, for one month, which had so taken his fancy, and\r\ncertainly a pretty enough place it was, although they found out\r\nafterwards, that why it was he was so charmed with it consisted in the\r\nfact that it bore the name of a vessel which he had once commanded; but\r\nthis they did not know until a long time afterwards, when it slipped out\r\nby mere accident.\r\n\r\nThey stipulated with the admiral that there should not be more than\r\ntwenty guests at the breakfast which was to succeed the marriage\r\nceremony; and to that he acceded; but Henry whispered to Charles\r\nHolland,--\r\n\r\n"I know this public wedding to be distasteful to you, and most\r\nparticularly do I know it is distasteful to Flora; so, if you do not\r\nmind playing a trick upon the old man, I can very easily put you in the\r\nway of cheating him entirely."\r\n\r\n"Indeed; I should like to hear, and, what is more, I should like to\r\npractise, if you think it will not so entirely offend him as to make him\r\nimplacable."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, not at all; he will laugh himself, when he comes to know\r\nit, as much as any of us; the present difficulty will be to procure\r\nFlora\'s connivance; but that we must do the best way we can by\r\npersuasion."\r\n\r\nWhat this scheme was will ultimately appear; but, certain it is, that\r\nthe old admiral had no suspicion of what was going on, and proceeded to\r\nmake all his arrangements accordingly.\r\n\r\nFrom his first arrival in the market town--in the neighbourhood of which\r\nwas Bannerworth Hall--it will be recollected that he had taken a great\r\nfancy to the lawyer, in whose name a forged letter had been sent him,\r\ninforming him of the fact that his nephew, Charles Holland, intended\r\nmarrying into a family of vampyres.\r\n\r\nIt was this letter, as the reader is aware, which brought the old\r\nadmiral and Jack Pringle into the neighbourhood of the Hall; and,\r\nalthough it was a manoeuvre to get rid of Charles Holland, which failed\r\nmost signally, there can be no doubt but that such a letter was the\r\nproduction of Sir Francis Varney, and that he wrote it for the express\r\npurpose of getting rid of Charles from the Hall, who had begun\r\nmaterially to interfere with his plans and projects there.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation with himself, the admiral thought that this\r\nlawyer would be just the man to recommend the proper sort of people to\r\nbe invited to the wedding of Charles and Flora; so he wrote to him,\r\ninviting himself to dinner, and received back a very gracious reply from\r\nthe lawyer, who declared that the honour of entertaining a gentleman\r\nwhom he so much respected as Admiral Bell, was greater than he had a\r\nright to expect by a great deal, and that he should feel most grateful\r\nfor his company, and await his coming with the greatest impatience.\r\n\r\n"A devilish civil fellow, that attorney," said the admiral, as he put\r\nthe letter in his pocket, "and almost enough to put one in conceit of\r\nlawyers."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack Pringle, who had overheard the admiral read the letter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we will honour him; and I only hope he will have plenty of grog;\r\nbecause, you see, if he don\'t--D--n it! what\'s that? Can\'t you keep\r\nthings to yourself?"\r\n\r\nThis latter exclamation arose from the fact that the admiral was so\r\nindignant at Jack for listening to what he had been saying, as to throw\r\na leaden inkstand, that happened to be upon the table, at his head.\r\n\r\n"You mutinous swab!" he said, "cannot a gentleman ask me to dinner, or\r\ncannot I ask myself, without you putting your spoke in the windlass, you\r\nvagabond?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! well," said Jack, "if you are out of temper about it, I had better\r\nsend my mark to the lawyer, and tell him that we won\'t come, as it has\r\nmade some family differences."\r\n\r\n"Family, you thief!" said the admiral. "What do you mean? What family do\r\nyou think would own you? D--n me, if I don\'t think you came over in some\r\nstrange ship. But, I tell you what it is, if you interfere in this\r\nmatter, I\'ll be hanged if I don\'t blow your brains out."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll be hanged if you do," said Jack, as he walked out of the\r\nroom; "so it\'s all one either way, old fizgig."\r\n\r\n"What!" roared the admiral, as he sprang up and ran after Jack. "Have I\r\nlived all these years to be called names in my own ship--I mean my own\r\nhouse? What does the infernal rascal mean by it?"\r\n\r\nThe admiral, no doubt, would have pursued Jack very closely, had not\r\nFlora intercepted him, and, by gentle violence, got him back to the\r\nroom. No one else could have ventured to have stopped him, but the\r\naffection he had for her was so great that she could really accomplish\r\nalmost anything with him; and, by listening quietly to his complaints of\r\nJack Pringle--which, however, involved a disclosure of the fact which he\r\nhad intended to keep to himself, that he had sought the lawyer\'s\r\nadvice--she succeeded in soothing him completely, so that he forgot his\r\nanger in a very short time.\r\n\r\nBut the old man\'s anger, although easily aroused, never lasted very\r\nlong; and, upon the whole, it was really astonishing what he put up with\r\nfrom Jack Pringle, in the way of taunts and sneers, of all sorts and\r\ndescriptions, and now and then not a little real abuse.\r\n\r\nAnd, probably, he thought likewise that Jack Pringle did not mean what\r\nhe said, on the same principle that he (the admiral), when he called\r\nJack a mutinous swab and a marine, certainly did not mean that Jack was\r\nthose things, but merely used them as expletives to express a great\r\namount of indignation at the moment, because, as may be well supposed,\r\nnothing in the world could be worse, in Admiral Bell\'s estimation, that\r\nto be a mutinous swab or a marine.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a wonder, though, that, in his anger some day, he did not\r\ndo Jack some mischief; for, as we have had occasion to notice in one or\r\ntwo cases, the admiral was not extremely particular as to what sorts of\r\nmissiles he used when he considered it necessary to throw something at\r\nJack\'s head.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been a surprising thing if Jack had really made some\r\ncommunication to the lawyer; but he did stop short at that amount of\r\npleasantry, and, as he himself expressed it, for once in a way he let\r\nthe old man please himself.\r\n\r\nThe admiral soon forgot this little dispute, and then pleased himself\r\nwith the idea that he should pass a pleasant day with the attorney.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well," he said; "who would have thought that ever I should have\r\ngone and taken dinner with a lawyer--and not only done that, but invited\r\nmyself too! It shows us all that there may be some good in all sorts of\r\nmen, lawyers included; and I am sure, after this, I ought to begin to\r\nthink what I never thought before, and that is, that a marine may\r\nactually be a useful person. It shows that, as one gets older, one gets\r\nwiser."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was an immense piece of liberality for a man brought up, as Admiral\r\nBell had been, in decidedly one of the most prejudiced branches of the\r\npublic service, to make any such admissions as these. A very great thing\r\nit was, and showed a liberality of mind such as, even at the present\r\ntime, is not readily found.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing, as well as amusing, to find how the mind assimilates\r\nitself to the circumstances in which it is placed, and how society,\r\nbeing cut up into small sections, imagines different things merely as a\r\nconsequence of their peculiar application. We shall find that even\r\npeople, living at different ends of a city, will look with a sort of\r\npity and contempt upon each other; and it is much to be regretted that\r\npublic writers are found who use what little ability they may possess in\r\npandering to their feelings.\r\n\r\nIt was as contemptible and silly as it was reprehensible for a late\r\ncelebrated novelist to pretend that he believed there was at place\r\ncalled Bloomsbury-square, but he really did not know; because that was\r\nmerely done for the purpose of raising a silly laugh among persons who\r\nwere neither respectable on account of their abilities or their conduct.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression. The admiral, attired in his best\r\nsuit, which always consisted of a blue coat, the exact colour of the\r\nnavy uniform, an immense pale primrose coloured waistcoat, and white\r\nkerseymere continuations, went to the lawyer\'s as had been arranged.\r\n\r\nIf anything at all could flatter the old man\'s vanity successfully, it\r\ncertainly would be the manner in which he was received at the lawyer\'s\r\nhouse, where everything was done that could give him satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA very handsome repast was laid before him, and, when the cloth was\r\nremoved, the admiral broached the subject upon which he wished to ask\r\nthe advice of his professional friend. After telling him of the wedding\r\nthat was to come off, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Now, I have bargained to invite twenty people; and, of course, as that\r\nis exclusive of any of the family, and as I don\'t know any people about\r\nthis neighbourhood except yourself, I want you and your family to come\r\nto start with, and then I want you to find me out some more decent\r\npeople to make up the party."\r\n\r\n"I feel highly flattered," said the attorney, "that, in such a case as\r\nthis, you should have come to me, and my only great fear is, that I\r\nshould not be able to give you satisfaction."\r\n\r\n"Oh! you needn\'t be afraid of that; there is no fear on that head; so I\r\nshall leave it all to you to invite the folks that you think proper."\r\n\r\n"I will endeavour, certainly, admiral, to do my best. Of course, living\r\nin the town, as I have for many years, I know some very nice people as\r\nwell as some very queer ones."\r\n\r\n"Oh! we don\'t want any of the queer ones; but let those who are invited\r\nbe frank, hearty, good-tempered people, such as one will be glad to meet\r\nover and over again without any ceremony--none of your simpering people,\r\nwho are afraid to laugh for fear of opening their mouths too wide, but\r\nwho are so mighty genteel that they are afraid to enjoy anything for\r\nfear it should be vulgar."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, admiral, perfectly, and shall endeavour to obey your\r\ninstructions to the very letter; but, if I should unfortunately invite\r\nanybody you don\'t like, you must excuse me for making such a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course--of course. Never mind that; and, if any disagreeable\r\nfellow comes, we will smother him in some way."\r\n\r\n"It would serve him right, for no one ought to make himself\r\ndisagreeable, after being honoured with an invitation from you; but I\r\nwill be most especially careful, and I hope that such a circumstance\r\nwill not occur."\r\n\r\n"Never mind. If it should, I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do; I\'ll set Jack\r\nPringle upon him, and if he don\'t worry his life out it will be a\r\nstrange thing to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the lawyer, "I am glad you have mentioned him, for it gives\r\nme an opportunity of saying that I have done all in my power to make him\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"All in your power to make him comfortable! What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that I have placed such a dinner before him as will please him;\r\nI told him to ask for just whatever he likes."\r\n\r\nThe admiral looked at the lawyer with amazement, for a few moments, in\r\nsilence, and then he said,\r\n\r\n"D--n it! why, you don\'t mean to tell me, that that rascal is here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; he came about ten minutes I before you arrived, and said you\r\nwere coming, and he has been down stairs feasting all the while since."\r\n\r\n"Stop a bit. Do you happen to have any loaded fire arms in the house?"\r\n\r\n"We have got an old bunderbuss; but what for, admiral?"\r\n\r\n"To shoot that scoundrel, Pringle. I\'ll blow his brains out, as sure as\r\nfate. The impudence of his coming here, directly against my orders,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, calm yourself, and think nothing of it; it\'s of no\r\nconsequence whatever."\r\n\r\n"No consequence; where is that blunderbuss of yours? Do you mean to tell\r\nme that mutiny is of no consequence? Give me the blunderbuss."\r\n\r\n"But, my clear sir, we only keep it _in terrorem_, and have no bullets."\r\n\r\n"Never mind that, we can cram in a handful of nails, or brass buttons,\r\nor hammer up a few halfpence--anything of that sort will do to settle\r\nhis business with."\r\n\r\n"How do you get on, old Tarbarrel?" said Jack, putting his head in at\r\nthe door. "Are you making yourself comfortable? I\'ll be hanged if I\r\ndon\'t think you have a drop too much already, you look so precious red\r\nabout the gills. I have been getting on famous, and I thought I\'d just\r\nhop up for a minute to make your mind easy about me, and tell you so."\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that Jack had done justice to the good cheer of the\r\nlawyer, for he was rather unsteady, and had to hold by the door-post to\r\nsupport himself, while there was such a look of contentment upon his\r\ncountenance as contrasted with the indignation that was manifest upon\r\nthe admiral\'s face that, as the saying is, it would have made a cat\r\nlaugh to see them.\r\n\r\n"Be off with ye, Jack," said the lawyer; "be off with ye. Go down stairs\r\nagain and enjoy yourself. Don\'t you see that the admiral is angry with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he be bothered," said Jack; "I\'ll soon settle him if he comes any\r\nof his nonsense; and mind, Mr. Lawyer, whatever you do, don\'t you give\r\nhim too much to drink."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer ran to the door, and pushed Jack out, for he rightly enough\r\nsuspected that the quietness of the admiral was only that calm which\r\nprecedes a storm of more than usual amount and magnitude, so he was\r\nanxious to part them at once.\r\n\r\nHe then set about appeasing, as well as he could, the admiral\'s anger,\r\nby attributing the perseverance of Jack, in following him wherever he\r\nwent, to his great affection for him, which, combined with his\r\nignorance, might make him often troublesome when he had really no\r\nintention of being so.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly the best way of appeasing the old man; and, indeed,\r\nthe only way in which it could be done successfully, and the proof that\r\nit was so, consisted in the fact, that the admiral did consent, at the\r\nsuggestion of the attorney, to forgive Jack once more for the offence he\r\nhad committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BARON TAKES ANDERBURY HOUSE, AND DECIDES UPON GIVING A GRAND\r\nENTERTAINMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was not considered anything extraordinary that, although the Baron\r\nStolmuyer of Saltzburgh went out with the mysterious stranger who had\r\narrived at the Anderbury Arms to see him, he should return without him\r\nfor certainly he was not bound to bring him back, by any means whatever.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he entered the inn so quietly, and with such an appearance of\r\nperfect composure, that no one could have suspected for a moment that he\r\nhad been guilty really of the terrific crime which had been laid to his\r\ncharge--a crime which few men could have committed in so entirely\r\nunmoved and passionless a manner as he had done it.\r\n\r\nBut he seemed to consider the taking of a human life as a thing not of\r\nthe remotest consequence, and not to be considered at all as a matter\r\nwhich was to put any one out of the way, but as a thing to be done when\r\nnecessity required, with all the ease in the world, without arousing or\r\nawaking any of those feelings of remorse which one would suppose ought\r\nto find a place in the heart of a man who had been guilty of such\r\nmonstrous behaviour.\r\n\r\nHe walked up to his own apartment again, and retired to rest with the\r\nsame feeling, apparently, of calmness, and the same ability to taste of\r\nthe sweets of repose as had before characterized him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger\'s horse, which was a valuable and beautiful animal,\r\nremained in the stable of the inn, and as, of course, that was\r\nconsidered a guarantee for his return, the landlord, when he himself\r\nretired to rest, left one of his establishment sitting up to let in the\r\nman who now lay so motionless and so frightful in appearance in one of\r\nthe ice-wells of the mysterious passage leading from the base of the\r\ncliff, to the grounds of Anderbury House.\r\n\r\nBut the night wore on, and the man who had been left to let the stranger\r\nin, after making many efforts to keep himself awake, dropped into sound\r\nrepose, which he might just as well have done in the first instance,\r\ninasmuch as, although he knew it not, he was engaged in the vain task of\r\nwaiting for the dead.\r\n\r\nThe morning was fresh and beautiful, and, at a far earlier hour than a\r\nperson of his quality was expected to make his appearance, the baron\r\ndescended from his chamber; for, somehow or other, by common consent, it\r\nseems to be agreed that great personages must be late in rising, and\r\nequally late in going to bed.\r\n\r\nBut the baron was evidently not so disposed to turn night into day, and\r\nthe landlord congratulated himself not a little upon the fact that he\r\nwas ready for his illustrious guest when he descended so unexpectedly\r\nfrom his chamber as he did.\r\n\r\nAn ample breakfast was disposed of; that is to say, it was placed upon\r\nthe table, and charged to the baron, who selected from it what he\r\npleased; and when the meal was over the landlord ventured to enter the\r\napartment, and said to him, with all due humility,--\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir, Mr. Leek, who has the letting of\r\nAnderbury-on-the-Mount, that is, Anderbury House, as it is usually\r\ncalled, is here, sir, and would be happy to take your orders as to when\r\nyou would be pleased to look at those premises?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be ready to go in half a hour," said the baron; "and, as the\r\ndistance is not great, I will walk from here to the mansion."\r\n\r\nThis message was duly communicated to Mr. Leek, who thereupon determined\r\nupon waiting until the baron should announce his readiness to depart\r\nupon the expedition; and he was as good as his word, for, in about\r\nhalf-an-hour afterwards, he descended to the hall, and then Mr. Leek was\r\nsummoned, who came out of the bar with such a grand rush, that he fell\r\nover a mat that was before him, and saluted the baron by digging his\r\nhead into his stomach, and then falling sprawling at his feet, and\r\nlaying hold of his ankle.\r\n\r\nThis little incident was duly apologised for, and explained; after which\r\nMr. Leek walked on through the town, towards Anderbury-on-the-Mount,\r\nfollowed by the illustrious personage whom he sincerely hoped he should\r\nbe able to induce to take it.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing to see how they traversed the streets together;\r\nfor while the baron walked right on, and with a solemn and measured\r\nstep, Mr. Leek managed to get along a few paces in front of him,\r\nsideways, so that he could keep up a sort of conversation upon the\r\nmerits of Anderbury House, and the neighbourhood in general, without\r\nmuch effort; to which remarks the baron made such suitable and dignified\r\nreplies as a baron would be supposed to make.\r\n\r\n"You will find, sir," said Mr. Leek, "that everything about Anderbury is\r\nextremely select, and amazingly correct; and I am sure a more delightful\r\nplace to live in could not be found."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the baron; "very likely."\r\n\r\n"It\'s lively, too," continued Mr. Leek; "very lively; and there are two\r\nchapels of ease, besides the church."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a drawback," said the baron.\r\n\r\n"A drawback, sir! well, I am sorry I mentioned it; but perhaps you are a\r\nRoman Catholic, sir, and, in that case, the chapels of ease have no\r\ninterest for you."\r\n\r\n"Not the slightest; but do not, sir, run away with any assumption\r\nconcerning my religious opinions, for I am not a Roman Catholic."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, no, sir; nor more am I; and, as far as I think, and my opinion\r\ngoes, I say, why shouldn\'t a gentleman with a large fortune be what he\r\nlikes, or nothing, if he likes that better? but here we are, sir, close\r\nto one of the entrances of Anderbury House. There are three principal\r\nentrances, you understand, sir, on three sides of the estate, and the\r\nfourth side faces the sea, where there is that mysterious passage that\r\nleads down from the grounds to the beach, which, perhaps, you have heard\r\nof, sir."\r\n\r\n"The landlord of the inn mentioned it."\r\n\r\n"We consider it a great curiosity, sir, I can assure you, in these\r\nparts--a very great curiosity; and it\'s an immense advantage to the\r\nhouse, because, you see, sir, in extremely hot weather, all sorts of\r\nprovisions can be taken down there, and kept at such a very low\r\ntemperature as to be quite delightful."\r\n\r\n"That is an advantage."\r\n\r\nMr. Leek rang the bell that hung over one of the entrances, and his\r\nsummons for admission was speedily answered by the old couple who had\r\ncharge of the premises, and then, with a view of impressing them with a\r\nnotion of the importance of the personage whom he had brought to look at\r\nthe place, he said, aloud,--\r\n\r\n"The Baron Stoltmayor, of Saltsomething, has come to look at the\r\npremises."\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received with all due deference and respect, and\r\nthe task of showing the baron the premises at once fairly commenced.\r\n\r\n"Here you have," said Mr. Leek, assuming an oratorical attitude--"here\r\nyou have the umbrageous trees stooping down to dip their leaves in the\r\npurling waters; here you have the sweet foliage lending a delicious\r\nperfume to the balmy air; here you have the murmuring waterfalls playing\r\nmusic of the spheres to the listening birds, who sit responsive upon the\r\ndancing boughs; here you have all the fragrance of the briny ocean,\r\nmingling with the scent of a bank of violets, and wrapping the senses in\r\nElysium; here you may never tire of an existence that presents\r\nnever-ending charms, and that, in the full enjoyment of which, you may\r\nlive far beyond the allotted span of man."\r\n\r\n"Enough--enough," said the baron.\r\n\r\n"Here you have the choicest exotics taking kindly to a soil gifted by\r\nnature with the most extraordinary powers of production; and all that\r\ncan pamper the appetite or yield delight to the senses, is scattered\r\naround by nature with a liberal hand. It is quite impossible that\r\nroyalty should come near the favoured spot without visiting it as a\r\nthing of course; and I forgot to mention that a revenue is derived from\r\nsome cottages, which, although small, is yet sufficient to pay the tithe\r\non the whole estate."\r\n\r\n"There, there--that will do."\r\n\r\n"Here you have purling rills and cascades, and fish-ponds so redundant\r\nwith the finny tribe, that you have but to wish for sport, and it is\r\nyours; here you have in the mansion, chambers that vie with the\r\naccommodation of a palace--ample dormitories and halls of ancient\r\ngrandeur; here you have--"\r\n\r\n"Stop," said the baron, "stop; I cannot be pestered in this way with\r\nyour description. I have no patience to listen to such mere words--show\r\nme the house at once, and let me judge for myself."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir; oh! certainly; only I thought it right to give you a\r\nslight description of the place as it really was: and now, sir, that we\r\nhave reached the house, I may remark that here we have--"\r\n\r\n"Silence!" said the baron; "if you begin with here we have, I know not\r\nwhen you will leave off. All I require of you is to show me the place,\r\nand to answer any question which I may put to you concerning it. I will\r\ndraw my own conclusions, and nothing you can say, one way or another,\r\nwill affect my imagination."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir, certainly; I shall only be too happy to answer any\r\nquestions that may be put to me by a person of your lordship\'s great\r\nintelligence; and all I can remark is, that when you reach the\r\ndrawing-room floor, any person may truly say, here you have--I really\r\nbeg your pardon, sir--I had not the slightest intention of saying here\r\nyou have, I assure you; but the words came out quite unawares, I assure\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Peace--peace!" cried again the baron; "you disturb me by this incessant\r\nclatter."\r\n\r\nThus admonished, Mr. Leek was now quiet, and allowed the baron in his\r\nown way to make what investigation he pleased concerning Anderbury\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was not one that could be gone over in ten minutes;\r\nfor the house was extremely extensive, and the estate altogether\r\npresented so many features of beauty and interest, that it was\r\nimpossible not to linger over it for a considerable period of time.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were most extensive, and planted with such a regard to order\r\nand regularity, everything being in its proper place, that it was a\r\npleasure to see an estate so well kept. And although the baron was not a\r\nman who said much, it was quite evident, by what little he did utter,\r\nthat he was very well pleased with Anderbury-on-the-Mount.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Mr. Leek, "I will do myself the pleasure, sir, of\r\nshowing your grace the subterranean passage."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a loud ring at one of the entrance gates was heard, and\r\nupon the man who had charge of the house answering the summons for\r\nadmission, he found that it was a gentleman, who gave a card on which\r\nwas the name of Sir John Westlake, and who desired to see the premises.\r\n\r\n"Sir John Westlake," said Mr. Leek; "oh! I recollect he did call at my\r\noffice, and say that he thought of taking Anderbury-on-the-Mount. A\r\ngentleman of great and taste is Sir John, but I must tell him, baron,\r\nthat you have the preference if you choose to embrace it."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the stranger advanced, and when he saw the baron, he\r\nbowed courteously, upon which Mr. Leek said,--\r\n\r\n"I regret, Sir John, that if you should take a fancy to the place, I am\r\ncompelled first of all to give this gentleman the refusal of it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Sir John Westlake; "do not let me interfere with any\r\none. I have nearly made up my mind, and came to look over the property\r\nagain; but of course, if this gentleman is beforehand with me, I must be\r\ncontent. I wish particularly to go down to the subterranean passage to\r\nthe beach, if it is not too much trouble."\r\n\r\n"Trouble! certainly not, sir. Here, Davis, get some links, and we can go\r\nat once; and as this gentleman likewise has seen everything but that\r\nstrange excavation, he will probably descend with us."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the baron; "I shall have great pleasure;" and he said\r\nit with so free and unembarrassed an air, that no one could have\r\nbelieved for a moment in the possibility that such a subject of fearful\r\ninterest to him was there to be found.\r\n\r\nThe entrance from the grounds into this deep cavernous place was in a\r\nsmall but neat building, that looked like a summer-house; and now,\r\ntorches being procured, and one lit, a door was opened, which conducted\r\nat once into the commencement of the excavation; and Mr. Leek heading\r\nthe way, the distinguished party, as that gentleman loved afterwards to\r\ncall it in his accounts of the transaction, proceeded into the very\r\nbowels of the earth, as it were, and quickly lost all traces of the\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nThe place did not descend by steps, but by a gentle slope, which it\r\nrequired some caution to traverse, because, being cut in the chalk,\r\nwhich in some places was worn very smooth, it was extremely slippery;\r\nbut this was a difficulty that a little practice soon overcame, and as\r\nthey went on the place became more interesting every minute.\r\n\r\nEven the baron allowed Mr. Leek to make a speech upon the occasion, and\r\nthat gentleman said,--\r\n\r\n"You will perceive that this excavation must have been made, at a great\r\nexpense, out of the solid cliff, and in making it some of the most\r\ncurious specimens of petrifaction and fossil remains were found. You see\r\nthat the roof is vaulted, and that it is only now and then a lump of\r\nchalk has fallen in, or a great piece of flint; and now we come to one\r\nof the ice-wells."\r\n\r\nThey came to a deep excavation, down which they looked, and when the man\r\nheld the torch beneath its surface, they could dimly see the bottom of\r\nit, where there was a number of large pieces of flint stone, and,\r\napparently, likewise, the remains of broken bottles.\r\n\r\n"There used to be a windlass at the top of this," said Mr. Leek, "and\r\nthe things were let down in a basket. They do say that ice will keep for\r\ntwo years in one of these places."\r\n\r\n"And are there more of these excavations?" said the baron.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes, sir; there are five or six of them for different\r\npurposes; for when the family that used to live in Anderbury House had\r\ngrand entertainments, which they sometimes had in the summer season,\r\nthey always had a lot of men down here, cooling wines, and passing them\r\nup from hand to hand to the house."\r\n\r\nFrom the gradual slope of this passage down to the cliffs, and the\r\nzigzag character of it, it may be well supposed that it was of\r\nconsiderable extent. Indeed, Mr. Leek asserted that it was half a mile\r\nin actual measured length.\r\n\r\nThe baron was not at all anxious to run any risk of a discovery of the\r\ndead body which he had cast into that ice-well which was nearest to the\r\nopening on to the beach, so, as he went on, he negatived the different\r\nproposals that were made to look down into the excavations, and\r\nsucceeded in putting a stop to that species of inquiry in the majority\r\nof instances, but he could not wholly do so.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been better for his purpose if he had encouraged a\r\nlook into every one of the ice-wells; for, in that case, their\r\nsimilarity of appearance might have tired out Sir John Westlake before\r\nthey got to the last one; but as it was, when they reached the one down\r\nwhich the body had been precipitated, he had the mortification to hear\r\nMr. Leek say,--\r\n\r\n"And now, Sir John, and you, my lord baron, as we have looked at the\r\nfirst of these ice wells and at none of the others, suppose we look at\r\nthe last."\r\n\r\nThe baron was afraid to say anything; because, if the body were\r\ndiscovered, and identified as that of the visitor at the inn, and who\r\nhad been seen last with him, any reluctance on his part to have that\r\nice-well examined, might easily afterwards be construed into a very\r\npowerful piece of circumstantial evidence against him.\r\n\r\nHe therefore merely bowed his assent, thinking that the examination\r\nwould be but a superficial one, and that, in consequence, he should\r\nescape easily from any disagreeable consequences.\r\n\r\nBut this the fates ordained otherwise; and there seemed no hope of that\r\nice-well in particular escaping such an investigation as was sure to\r\ninduce some uncomfortable results.\r\n\r\n"Davis," said Mr. Leek, "these places are not deep, you see, and I was\r\nthinking that if you went down one of them, it would be as well; for\r\nthen you would be able to tell the gentlemen what the bottom was fairly\r\ncomposed of, you understand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mind, sir," said Davis. "I have been down one of them\r\nbefore to-day, I can tell you, sir."\r\n\r\n"I do not see the necessity," said Sir John Westlake, "exactly, of such\r\na thing; but still if you please, and this gentleman wishes--"\r\n\r\n"I have no wish upon the occasion," said the baron; "and, like yourself,\r\ncannot see the necessity."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is no trouble," said Mr. Leek; "and it\'s better, now you are\r\nhere, that you see and understand all about it. How can you get down,\r\nDavis?"\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, it ain\'t above fourteen feet altogether; so I sha\'n\'t have\r\nany difficulty, for I can hang by my hands about half the distance, and\r\ndrop the remainder."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took off his coat, and then stuck the link he carried\r\ninto a cleft of the rock, that was beside the brink of the excavation.\r\n\r\nThe baron now saw that there would be no such thing as avoiding a\r\ndiscovery of the fact of the dead body being in that place, and his only\r\nhope was, that in its descent it might have become so injured as to defy\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nBut this was a faint hope, because he recollected that he had himself\r\nseen the face, which was turned upwards, and the period after death was\r\nby far too short for him to have any hope that decomposition could have\r\ntaken place even to the most limited extent.\r\n\r\nThe light, which was stuck in a niche, shed but a few inefficient rays\r\ndown into the pit, and, as the baron stood, with folded arms, looking\r\ncalmly on, he expected each moment a scene of surprise and terror would\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nNor was he wrong; for scarcely had the man plunged down into that deep\r\nplace, than he uttered a cry of alarm and terror, and shouted,--\r\n\r\n"Murder! murder! Lift me out. There is a dead man down here, and I have\r\njumped upon him."\r\n\r\n"A dead man!" cried Mr. Leek and Sir John Westlake in a breath.\r\n\r\n"How very strange!" said the baron.\r\n\r\n"Lend me a hand," cried Davis; "lend me a hand out; I cannot stand this,\r\nyou know. Lend me a hand out, I say, at once."\r\n\r\nThis was easier to speak of than to do, and Mr. Davis began to discover\r\nthat it was easier by far to get into a deep pit, than to get out of\r\none, notwithstanding that his assertion of having been down into those\r\nplaces was perfectly true; but then he had met with nothing alarming,\r\nand had been able perfectly at his leisure to scramble out the best way\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nNow, however, his frantic efforts to release himself from a much more\r\nuncomfortable situation than he had imagined it possible for him to get\r\ninto, were of so frantic a nature, that he only half buried himself in\r\npieces of chalk, which he kept pulling down with vehemence from the\r\nsides of the pit, and succeeded in accomplishing nothing towards his\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the fellow is only joking," said the baron, "and amusing himself at\r\nour expense."\r\n\r\nBut the manner in which the man cried for help, and the marked terror\r\nwhich was in every tone, was quite sufficient to prove that he was not\r\nacting; for if he were, a more accomplished mimic could not have been\r\nfound on the stage than he was.\r\n\r\n"This is serious," said Sir John Westlake, "and cannot be allowed. Have\r\nyou any ropes here by which we can assist him from the pit? Don\'t be\r\nalarmed, my man, for if there be a dead body in the pit, it can\'t harm\r\nyou. Take your time quietly and easily, and you will assuredly get out."\r\n\r\n"Aye," said the baron, "the more haste, the worst speed, is an English\r\nproverb, and in this case it will be fully exemplified. This man would\r\neasily leave the pit, if he would have the patience, with care and\r\nquietness, to clamber up its sides."\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Davis felt the truth of these exhortations, for\r\nalthough he trembled excessively, he did begin to make some progress in\r\nhis ascent, and get so high, that Mr. Leek was enabled to get hold of\r\nhis hand, and give him a little assistance, so that, in another minute\r\nor so, he was rescued from his situation, which was not one of peril,\r\nalthough it was certainly one of fright.\r\n\r\nHe trembled so excessively, and stuttered and stammered, that for some\r\nminutes no one could understand very well what he said; but at length,\r\nupon making himself intelligible, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"There has been a murder! there has been a murder committed, and the\r\nbody thrown into the ice pit. I felt that I jumped down upon something\r\nsoft, and when I put down my hand to feel what it was, it came across a\r\ndead man\'s face, and then, of course, I called out."\r\n\r\n"You certainly did call out."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so would anybody, I think, under such circumstances. I suppose\r\nI shall be hung now, because I had charge of the house?"\r\n\r\n"That did not strike me until this moment," said the baron; "but if\r\nthere be a dead body in that pit, it certainly places this man in a very\r\nawkward position."\r\n\r\n"What the deuce do you mean?" said Davis; "I don\'t know no more about it\r\nthan the child unborn. There is a dead man in the ice-well, and that is\r\nall I know about it; but whether he has been there a long time, or a\r\nshort time, I don\'t know any more than the moon, so it\'s no use\r\nbothering me about it."\r\n\r\n"My good man," said the baron, "it would be very wrong indeed to impute\r\nto you any amount of criminality in this business, since you may be\r\nentirely innocent; and I, for one, believe that you are so, for I cannot\r\nthink that any guilty man would venture into the place where he had put\r\nthe body of his victim, in the way that you ventured into that pit. I\r\nsay I cannot believe it possible, and therefore I think you innocent,\r\nand will take care to see that no injustice is done you; but at the same\r\ntime I cannot help adding, that I think, of course, you will find\r\nyourself suspected in some way."\r\n\r\n"I am very much obliged to you, sir," said Davis; "but as I happen to be\r\nquite innocent, I am very easy about it, and don\'t care one straw what\r\npeople say. I have not been in this excavation for Heaven knows how\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"But what\'s to be done?" said Mr. Leek. "I suppose it\'s our duty to do\r\nsomething, under such circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Unquestionably," said the baron; "and the first thing to be done, is to\r\ninform the police of what has happened, so that the body may be got up;\r\nand as I have now seen enough of the estate to satisfy me as regards its\r\ncapabilities, I decide at once upon taking it, if I can agree upon the\r\nconditions of the tenancy, and I will purchase it, if the price be such\r\nas I think suitable."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Leek, "if anything could reconcile me to the\r\nextraordinary circumstance that has just occurred, it certainly is,\r\nbaron, the having so desirable a tenant for Anderbury-on-the-Mount as\r\nyourself. But we need not traverse all this passage again, for it is\r\nmuch nearer now to get out upon the sea-coast at once, as we are so\r\nclose to the other opening upon the beach. It seems to me that we ought\r\nto proceed at once to the town, and give information to the authorities\r\nof the discovery which we have made."\r\n\r\n"It is absolutely necessary," said the baron, "so to do; so come along\r\nat once. I shall proceed to my inn, and as, of course, I have seen\r\nnothing more than yourselves, and consequently could only repeat your\r\nevidence, I do not see that my presence is called for. Nevertheless, of\r\ncourse, if the justices think it absolutely necessary that I should\r\nappear, I can have no possible objection to so do."\r\n\r\nThis was as straightforward as anything that could be desired, and,\r\nmoreover, it was rather artfully put together, for it seemed to imply\r\nthat he, Mr. Leek, would be slighted, if his evidence was not considered\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Mr. Leek; "I don\'t see at all why, as you, sir, have\r\nonly the same thing to say as myself, I should not be sufficient."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call upon me on any account," said Sir John Westlake.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no," cried Mr. Leek; "there is no occasion. I won\'t, you may\r\ndepend, if it can be helped."\r\n\r\nSir John, in rather a nervous and excited manner, bade them good day,\r\nbefore they got quite into the town, and hurried off; while the baron,\r\nwith a dignified bow, when he reached the door of his hotel, said to Mr.\r\nLeek,--\r\n\r\n"Of course I do not like the trouble of judicial investigations more\r\nthan anybody else, and therefore, unless it is imperatively necessary\r\nthat I should appear, I shall take it as a favour to be released from\r\nsuch a trouble."\r\n\r\n"My lord baron," said Mr. Leek, "you may depend that I shall mention\r\nthat to the magistrates and the coroner, and all those sort of people;"\r\nand then Mr. Leek walked away, but he muttered to himself, as he did so,\r\n"They will have him, as sure as fate, just because he is a baron; and\r\nhis name will look well in the \'County Chronicle.\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Leek then repaired immediately to the house of one of the principal\r\nmagistrates, and related what had occurred, to the great surprise of\r\nthat gentleman, who suggested immediately the propriety of making the\r\nfact known to the coroner of the district, as it was more his business,\r\nthan a magistrate\'s, in the first instance, since nobody was accused of\r\nthe offence.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was immediately followed, and that functionary directed\r\nthat the body should be removed from where it was to the nearest\r\npublic-house, and immediately issued his precept for an inquiry into the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBy this time the matter had begun to get bruited about in the town, and\r\nof course it went from mouth to mouth with many exaggerations; and\r\nalthough it by no means did follow that a murder had been committed\r\nbecause a dead body had been found, yet, such was the universal\r\nimpression; and the matter began to be talked about as the murder in the\r\nsubterranean passage leading to Anderbury House, with all the gusto\r\nwhich the full particulars of some deed of blood was calculated to\r\ninspire. And how it spread about was thus:--\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Mr. Leek was so anxious to let Anderbury-on-the-Mount\r\nto the rich Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh, that he got a friend of his\r\nto come and personate Sir John Westlake, while he, the baron, was\r\nlooking at the premises, in order to drive him at once to a conclusion\r\nupon the matter; so that what made Sir John so very anxious that he\r\nshould not be called forward in the matter, consisted in the simple fact\r\nthat he was nothing else than plain Mr. Brown, who kept a hatter\'s shop\r\nin the town; but he could not keep his own counsel, and, instead of\r\nholding his tongue, as he ought to have done, about the matter, he told\r\nit to every one he met, so that in a short time it was generally known\r\nthat something serious and startling had occurred in the subterranean\r\npassage to Anderbury House, and a great mob of persons thronged the\r\nbeach in anxious expectation of getting more information on the matter.\r\n\r\nThe men, likewise, who had been ordered by the coroner to remove the\r\nbody, soon reached the spot, and they gave an increased impetus to the\r\nproceedings, by opening the door of the subterranean passage, and then\r\nlooking earnestly along the beach as if in expectation of something or\r\nsomebody of importance.\r\n\r\nWhen eagerly questioned by the mob, for the throng of persons now\r\nassembled quite amounted to a mob, to know what they waited for, one of\r\nthem said,--\r\n\r\n"A coffin was to have been brought down to take the body in."\r\n\r\nThis announcement at once removed anything doubtful that might be in the\r\nminds of any of them upon the subject, and at once proclaimed the fact\r\nnot only that there was a dead body, but that if they looked out they\r\nwould see it forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe throng thickened, and by the time two men were observed approaching\r\nwith a coffin on their shoulders, there was scarcely anybody left in the\r\ntown, except a few rare persons, indeed, who were not so curious as\r\ntheir neighbours.\r\n\r\nIt was not an agreeable job, even to those men who were not the most\r\nparticular in the world, to be removing so loathsome a spectacle as that\r\nwhich they were pretty sure to encounter in the ice-well; but they did\r\nnot shrink from it, and, by setting about it as a duty, they got through\r\nit tolerably well.\r\n\r\nThey took with them several large torches, and then, one having\r\ndescended into the pit, fastened a rope under the arms of the dead man,\r\nand so he was hauled out, and placed in the shell that was ready to\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nThey were all surprised at the fresh and almost healthful appearance of\r\nthe countenance, and it was quite evident to everybody that if any one\r\nhad known him in life, they could not have the least possible difficulty\r\nin recognising him now that he was no more.\r\n\r\nAnd the only appearance of injury which he exhibited was in that\r\ndreadful wound which had certainly proved his death, and which was\r\nobservable in his throat the moment they looked upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe crush to obtain a sight of the body was tremendous at the moment it\r\nwas brought out, and a vast concourse of persons followed it in\r\nprocession to the town, where the greatest excitement prevailed. It was\r\neasily discovered that no known person was missing, and some who had\r\ncaught a sight of the body, went so far as to assert that it must have\r\nbeen in the ice-well for years, and that the extreme cold had preserved\r\nit in all its original freshness.\r\n\r\nThe news, of course, came round, although not through the baron, for he\r\ndid not condescend to say one word about it at the inn, and it was the\r\nlandlord who first started the suggestion of--"What suppose it is the\r\ngentleman who left his horse here?"\r\n\r\nThis idea had no sooner got possession of his brain, than it each moment\r\nseemed to him to assume a more reasonable and tangible form, and without\r\nsaying any more to any one else about it, he at once started off to\r\nwhere the body lay awaiting an inquest, to see if his suspicions were\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the public-house and asked to see the body, he was at\r\nonce permitted to do so; for the landlord knew him, and was as curious\r\nas he could be upon the subject by any possibility. One glance, of\r\ncourse, was sufficient, and the landlord at once said,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have seen him before, though I don\'t know his name. He came to\r\nmy house last night, and left his horse there; and, although I only saw\r\nhim for a moment as he passed through the hall, I am certain I am not\r\nmistaken. I dare say all my waiters will recognise him, as well as the\r\nBaron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, who is staying with me, and who no doubt\r\nknows very well who he is, for he went out with him late and came home\r\nalone, and I ordered one of my men to wait up all night in order to let\r\nin this very person who is now lying dead before us."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you did! But you don\'t suppose the baron murdered him, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a mystery to me altogether--quite a profound mystery. It\'s very\r\nunlikely, certainly; and what\'s the most extraordinary part of the whole\r\naffair is, how the deuce could he come into one of the ice-wells\r\nbelonging to Anderbury House. That\'s what puzzles me altogether."\r\n\r\n"Well, it will all come out, I hope, at the inquest, which is to be held\r\nat four o\'clock to day. There must have been foul play somewhere, but\r\nthe mystery is where, and that Heaven only knows, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I shall attend," said the landlord, "of course, to identify him; and I\r\nsuppose, unless anybody claims the horse, I may as well keep possession\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you flatter yourself that you will get the horse out of the\r\ntransaction. Don\'t you know quite well that the government takes\r\npossession of everything as don\'t belong to nobody?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I have got him, and possession, you know, is nine points of\r\nthe law."\r\n\r\n"It may be so; but their tenth point will get the better of you for all\r\nthat. You take my word for it, the horse will be claimed of you; but I\r\ndon\'t mind, as an old acquaintance, putting you up to a dodge."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'ll tell you what happened with a friend of mine; but don\'t think\r\nit was me for if it was I would tell you at once, so don\'t think it. He\r\nkept a country public-house; and, one day, an elderly gentleman came in,\r\nand appeared to be unwell. He just uttered a word or two, and then\r\ndropped down dead. He happened to have in his fob a gold repeater, that\r\nwas worth, at least a hundred guineas, and my friend, before anybody\r\ncame, took it out, and popped in, in its stead, an old watch that he\r\nhad, which was not worth a couple of pounds."\r\n\r\n"It was running a risk."\r\n\r\n"It was; but it turned out very well, because the old gentleman happened\r\nto be a very eccentric person, and was living alone, so that his friends\r\nreally did not know what he had, or what he had not, but took it for\r\ngranted that any watch produced belonged to him. So, if I were you in\r\nthis case, when the gentleman\'s horse is claimed. I\'d get the d--dest\r\nold screw I could, and let them have that."\r\n\r\n"You would?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed would I, and glory in it, too, as the very best thing that could\r\nbe done. Now, a horse is of use to you?"\r\n\r\n"I believe ye, it is."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; but what\'s the use of it to government? and, what\'s more, if\r\nit went to the government, there might be some excuse; but the\r\ngovernment will know no more about it, and make not so much as I shall.\r\nSome Jack-in-office will lay hold of it as a thing of course and a\r\nperquisite, when you might just as well, and a great deal better, too,\r\nkeep it yourself, for it would do you some good, as you say, and none to\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it; it is a good and a happy thought. There is no reason on\r\nearth why I shouldn\'t do it, and I will. I have made up my mind to it\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am glad you have. What do you think now the dead man\'s horse is\r\nworth?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! fifty or sixty guineas value."\r\n\r\n"Then very good. Then, when the affair is all settled, I will trouble\r\nyou for twenty pounds.\r\n\r\n"You?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure. Who else do you suppose is going to interfere with\r\nyou? One is enough, ain\'t it, at a time; and I think, after giving you\r\nsuch advice as I have, that I am entitled, at all events, to something."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said the landlord of the hotel, "taking all things\r\ninto consideration, I have altered my mind rather, and won\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Very good. You need not; only mind, if you do, I am down upon you like\r\na shot."\r\n\r\nThe excitement contingent upon the inquest was very great; indeed, the\r\nlarge room in the public-house, where it was held, was crowded to\r\nsuffocation with persons who were anxious to be present at the\r\nproceedings. When the landlord reached home, of course he told his\r\nguest, the baron, of the discovery he had made, that the murdered man\r\nwas the strange visitor of the previous night; for now, from the\r\nfrightful wound he had received in his throat, the belief that he was\r\nmurdered became too rational a one to admit of any doubts, and was that\r\nwhich was universally adopted in preference to any other suggestion upon\r\nthe occasion; although, no doubt, people would be found who would not\r\nscruple to aver that he had cut his own throat, after making his way\r\ninto the well belonging to Anderbury House.\r\n\r\nThe landlord had his own misgivings concerning his guest, the baron, now\r\nthat something had occurred of such an awful and mysterious a nature to\r\none who was evidently known to him. It did not seem to be a pleasant\r\nthing to have such an intimate friend of a man who had been murdered in\r\none\'s house, especially when it came to be considered that he was the\r\nlast person seen in his company, and that, consequently, he was\r\npeculiarly called upon to give an explanation of how, and under what\r\ncircumstances, he had parted with him.\r\n\r\nThe baron was sitting smoking in the most unconcerned manner in the\r\nworld, when the landlord came to bring him this intelligence, and, when\r\nhe had heard him to an end, the remark he made was,--\r\n\r\n"Really, you very much surprise me; but, perhaps, as you are better\r\nacquainted with the town than I am, you can tell me who he was?"\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, that is what we hoped you would be able to tell us."\r\n\r\n"How should I tell you? He introduced himself to me as a Mr. Mitchell, a\r\nsurveyor, and he said that, hearing I talked of purchasing or renting\r\nAnderbury-on-the-Mount, he came to tell me that the principal side wall,\r\nthat you could see from the beach, was off the perpendicular."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and as this was a very interesting circumstance to me, considering\r\nthat I really did contemplate such a purchase or renting, and do so\r\nstill, as it was a moonlight night, and he said he could show me in a\r\nminute what he meant if I would accompany him, I did so; but when we got\r\nthere, and on the road, I heard quite enough of him to convince me that\r\nhe was a little out of his senses, and, consequently, I paid no more\r\nattention to what he said, but walked home and left him on the beach."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a most extraordinary circumstance, sir; there is no such person, I\r\nassure you, as Mitchell, a surveyor, in the town; so I can\'t make it out\r\nin the least."\r\n\r\n"But, I tell you, I consider the man out of his senses, and perhaps that\r\nmay account for the whole affair."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, sir, that would, certainly; but still, it\'s a very odd thing,\r\nbecause we don\'t know of such a person at all, and it does seem so\r\nextraordinary that he should have made his appearance, all of a sudden,\r\nin this sort of way. I suppose, sir, that you will attend the inquest,\r\nnow, that\'s to be held upon him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I have no objection whatever to that; indeed, I feel myself\r\nbound to do so, because I suppose mine is the latest evidence that can\r\nbe at all produced concerning him."\r\n\r\n"Unquestionably, sir; our coroner is a very clever man, and you will be\r\nglad to know him--very glad to know him, sir, and he will be glad to\r\nknow you, so I am sure it will be a mutual gratification. It\'s at four\r\no\'clock the inquest is to be, and I dare say, sir, if you are there by\r\nhalf-past, it will be time enough."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of that; but I will be punctual."\r\n\r\nWe have already said the room in which the inquest was to be held was\r\ncrowded almost to suffocation, and not only was that the case, but the\r\nlower part of the house was crammed with people likewise; and there can\r\nbe very little doubt but the baron would have shrunk from such an\r\ninvestigation from a number of curious eyes, if he could have done so;\r\nwhile the landlord of the house would have had no objection, as far as\r\nhis profit was concerned in the sale of a great quantity of beer and\r\nspirits, to have had such an occurrence every day in the week, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe body lay still in the shell where it had been originally placed.\r\nAfter it had been viewed by the jury, and almost every one had remarked\r\nupon the extraordinary fresh appearance it wore, they proceeded at once\r\nto the inquiry, and the first witness who appeared was Mr. Leek, who\r\ndeposed to have been in company with some gentlemen viewing Anderbury\r\nHouse, and to have found the body in one of the ice-wells of that\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThis evidence was corroborated by that of Davis, who had so unexpectedly\r\njumped into the well, without being aware that it contained already so\r\ndisagreeable a visitor as it did in the person of the murdered man,\r\nregarding the cause of whose death the present inquiry was instituted.\r\n\r\nThen the landlord identified the body as that of a gentleman who had\r\ncome to his house on horseback, and who had afterwards walked out with\r\nBaron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, who was one of his guests.\r\n\r\n"Is that gentleman in attendance?" said the coroner.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, he is; I told him about it, and he has kindly come forward to\r\ngive all the evidence in his power concerning it."\r\n\r\nThere was a general expression of interest and curiosity when the baron\r\nstepped forward, attired in his magnificent coat, trimmed with fur, and\r\ntendered his evidence to the coroner, which, of course, was precisely\r\nthe same as the statement he had made to the landlord of the house; for,\r\nas he had made up such a well connected story, he was not likely to\r\nprevaricate or to depart from it in the smallest particular.\r\n\r\nHe was listened to with breathless attention, and, when he had\r\nconcluded, the coroner, with a preparatory hem! said to him,\r\n\r\n"And you have reason to suppose, sir, that this person was out of his\r\nsenses?"\r\n\r\n"It seemed to me so; he talked wildly and incoherently, and in such a\r\nmanner as to fully induce such a belief."\r\n\r\n"You left him on the beach?"\r\n\r\n"I did. I found when I got there that it was only a very small portion,\r\nindeed, of Anderbury House that was visible; and, although the moon\r\nshone brightly, I must confess I did not see, myself, any signs of\r\ndeviation from the perpendicular; and, such being the case, I left the\r\nspot at once, because I could have no further motive in staying; and,\r\nmoreover, it was not pleasant to be out at night with a man whom I\r\nthought was deranged. I regretted, after making this discovery, that I\r\nhad come from home on such a fool\'s errand; but as, when one is going to\r\ninvest a considerable sum of money in any enterprise, one is naturally\r\nanxious to know all about it, I went, little suspecting that the man was\r\ninsane."\r\n\r\n"Did you see him after that?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, until to-day, when I recognised in the body that has\r\nbeen exhibited to me the same individual."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said the coroner to the jury, "it appears to me that this\r\nis a most mysterious affair; the deceased person has a wound in his\r\nthroat, which, I have no doubt, you will hear from a medical witness has\r\nbeen the cause of death; and the most singular part of the affair is,\r\nhow, if he inflicted it upon himself, he has managed to dispose of the\r\nweapon with which he did the deed."\r\n\r\n"The last person seen in his company," said one of the jury, "was the\r\nbaron, and I think he is bound to give some better explanation of the\r\naffair."\r\n\r\n"I am yet to discover," said the baron, "that the last person who\r\nacknowledges to having been in the company of a man afterwards murdered,\r\nmust, of necessity, be the murderer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but how do you account, sir, for there being no weapon found by\r\nwhich the man could have done the deed himself?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t account for it at all--how do you?"\r\n\r\n"This is irregular," said the coroner; "call the next witness."\r\n\r\nThis was a medical man, who briefly stated that he had seen the\r\ndeceased, and that the wound in his throat was amply sufficient to\r\naccount for his death; that it was inflicted with a sharp instrument\r\nhaving an edge on each side.\r\n\r\nThis, then, seemed to conclude the case, and the coroner remarked,--\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the jury,--I think this is one of those peculiar cases in\r\nwhich an open verdict is necessary, or else an adjournment without date,\r\nso that the matter can be resumed at any time, if fresh evidence can be\r\nprocured concerning it. There is no one accused of the offence, although\r\nit appears to me impossible that the unhappy man could have committed\r\nthe act himself. We have no reason to throw the least shade of suspicion\r\nor doubt upon the evidence of the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh; for as\r\nfar as we know anything of the matter, the murdered man may have been in\r\nthe company of a dozen people after the baron left him."\r\n\r\nA desultory conversation ensued, which ended in an adjournment of the\r\ninquest, without any future day being mentioned for its re-assembling,\r\nand so the Baron Stolmuyer entirely escaped from what might have been a\r\nvery serious affair to him.\r\n\r\nIt did not, however, appear to shake him in his resolution of taking\r\nAnderbury-on-the-Mount, although Mr. Leek very much feared it would; but\r\nhe announced to that gentleman his intention fully of doing so, and told\r\nhim to get the necessary papers drawn up forthwith.\r\n\r\n"I hope," he said, "within a few weeks\' time to be fairly installed in\r\nthat mansion, and then I will trouble you, Mr. Leek, to give me a list\r\nof the names of all the best families in the neighbourhood; for I intend\r\ngiving an entertainment on a grand scale in the mansion and grounds."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Mr. Leek, "I shall, with the greatest pleasure, attend upon\r\nyou in every possible way in this affair. This is a very excellent\r\nneighbourhood, and you will have no difficulty, I assure you, sir, in\r\ngetting together an extremely capital and creditable assemblage of\r\npersons. There could not be a better plan devised for at once\r\nintroducing all the people who are worth knowing, to you."\r\n\r\n"I thank you," said the baron; "I think the place will suit me well;\r\nand, as the Baroness Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh is dead, I have some idea\r\nof marrying again; and therefore it becomes necessary and desirable that\r\nI should be well acquainted with the surrounding families of distinction\r\nin this neighbourhood."\r\n\r\nThis was a hint not at all likely to be thrown away upon Mr. Leek, who\r\nwas the grand gossip-monger of the place, and he treasured it up in\r\norder to see if he could not make something of it which would be\r\nadvantageous to himself.\r\n\r\nHe knew quite enough of the select and fashionable families in that\r\nneighbourhood, to be fully aware that neither the baron\'s age nor his\r\nugliness would be any bar to his forming a matrimonial alliance.\r\n\r\n"There is not one of them," he said to himself, "who would not marry the\r\nvery devil himself and be called the Countess Lucifer, or any name of\r\nthe kind, always provided there was plenty of money: and that the baron\r\nhas without doubt, so it is equally without doubt he may pick and choose\r\nwhere he pleases."\r\n\r\nThis was quite correct of Mr. Leek, and showed his great knowledge of\r\nhuman nature; and we entertain with him a candid opinion, that if the\r\nBaron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had been ten times as ugly as he was, and\r\nHeaven knows that was needless, he might pick and choose a wife almost\r\nwhen he pleased.\r\n\r\nThis is a general rule; and as, of course, to all general rules there\r\nare exceptions, this one cannot be supposed to be free from them. Under\r\nall circumstances, and in all classes of society, there are\r\nsingle-minded beings who consult the pure dictates of their own hearts,\r\nand who, disdaining those things which make up the amount of the\r\nambition of meaner spirits, stand aloof as bright and memorable examples\r\nto the rest of human nature.\r\n\r\nSuch a being was Flora Bannerworth. She would never have been found to\r\nsacrifice herself to the fancied advantages of wealth and station, but\r\nwould have given her heart and hand to the true object of her affection,\r\nalthough a sovereign prince had made the endeavour to wean her from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Varney the Vampire, by Thomas Preskett Prest\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VARNEY THE VAMPIRE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14833.txt or 14833.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/8/3/14833/\r\n\r\nProduced by Charles Franks, Debra Storr, Sandra Brown and the PG\r\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
