[Translated from the Italian.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo publish a novel, to analyse, to eulogise it, and recommend its\r\nperusal to the good and pious, will appear no doubt very extraordinary,\r\nand offend the prejudices of many who have agreed among themselves to\r\nconsider a novel, whoever may be its author, and whatever may be its\r\nsubject, form, and design, as a pestilent production. If you ask them\r\nwhy? \xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d they will reply\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is a novel!\xe2\x80\x9d The answer is\r\nas wise as it is peremptory and decisive, and we will spare ourselves\r\nthe useless trouble of replying to arguments so profound and powerful.\r\nWe will, however, submit a few serious reflections to minds of a less\r\nelevated order, were it only to prove that we can talk reasonably, even\r\non the subject of novels.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if we are understood to designate by the appellation of\r\n_Novel_, the written dreams and extravagant imaginations of a corrupt\r\nmind and depraved heart, where illusions are substituted for realities,\r\nvice transformed into virtue, crime justified by the passions that lead\r\nto its perpetration, and fallacious pictures presented of an ideal\r\nworld, or criminal apologies for a world too real; if, we say, such are\r\nthe novels to be condemned and proscribed, none more than ourselves will\r\nbe disposed to confirm the sentence. The unhappy influence which\r\nproductions like these have exerted over the minds of youth, and above\r\nall, the ravages which their multiplication has within a few years\r\nproduced, is a fact acknowledged by all, by those who have escaped the\r\ncontagion of their perusal, as well as by those whom that perusal has\r\ninjured. With respect to this, the wise and the good are unanimous in\r\ntheir testimony and their anathemas; it is one of those self-evident\r\ntruths, about which an Englishman or a German might still elaborate many\r\na learned dissertation, but of which we shall take no further notice,\r\ncertain that we should only repeat much less forcibly and eloquently,\r\nthat which a thousand writers or orators have said before us.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point of view under which we must consider novels,\r\nor rather the works so called, but which bear, to those which morals and\r\ngood taste reprobate, no other resemblance than the name. These are, it\r\nis true, unhappily few in number, and therefore have not been classed by\r\nthemselves, but have been comprehended in the common appellation, and\r\nincluded in the general proscription; like an honest man, who, bearing\r\nthe same name as a rogue, partakes with him the odium of his reputation.\r\nBut this is an injustice for which we are disposed to claim reparation.\r\n\r\nEvery work of imagination, in which the author causes ideal personages\r\nto speak, think, and act, according to his pleasure, has been\r\nstigmatised as a _Novel_. But, if we allow this rigorous definition, the\r\napologue, so dear to the moralist, is a _Novel_, and deserving of\r\nproscription. We will go further; the parable, which also creates its\r\ncharacters and invents their words and actions, is a _novel_! But who\r\nwould dare to call them so? Who would dare profane by this name, those\r\nprofound allegories, those holy fables, so excellent in truth, and so\r\nreplete with instruction, which God himself has related to man? Finally,\r\nif we peruse the works of the most austere philosophers, and the most\r\nsevere moralists, without excepting ecclesiastical writers, we shall\r\nfind among them all, pictures of fancy or ideal histories of imaginary\r\npersons, fiction serving as a veil, or rather (we must acknowledge it)\r\nas an apology for truth.\r\n\r\nNow, we ask, by what unjust caprice would we condemn in the novelist\r\nthat which we admire and applaud in the moralist and philosopher; or\r\nrather, by what title do we interdict to the former the right of being\r\nequally philosophical and moral with the latter? If man were without\r\nweaknesses and society without imperfections, truth would prevail of\r\nitself, and in order to be loved and obeyed, it would need only to be\r\nshown in its unadorned purity and undisguised nakedness. But, from the\r\nbeginning of the world, pride has precipitated man into darkness.\r\nCorrupt and blind, a jealous susceptibility is developed in his\r\ncharacter, which continually increases in proportion to his blindness\r\nand corruptions,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the deeper he is plunged in darkness,\r\nthe more he dreads the light, and it is but by degrees, and under\r\nvarious disguises, that we can hope ultimately to make him endure its\r\nfull blaze.\r\n\r\nBesides, fiction, under divers forms, such as fables, apologues, novels,\r\nallegories, and tales, constitutes a large portion of the literature of\r\nevery nation; to this we may add the utility, nay, even the necessity of\r\ndisguising truth, in order to make it acceptable to our imperfection;\r\nand more than all, the good frequently resulting from these modest\r\nproductions ought to stimulate those on whom Heaven has bestowed the\r\nsame kind of talent, to employ it in exposing vice and reforming the\r\ncorruptions of society.\r\n\r\nBut if the imperfection and weakness of our hearts render fiction\r\nnecessary to us, a similar necessity results from the languor and\r\ninaction of our minds: for in proportion to the extent of public\r\ncorruption, individual application of the mind to severe and serious\r\nstudy diminishes. Insensibly all continued exercise of the powers of his\r\nunderstanding becomes irksome to man, and he finally considers thought\r\nand _ennui_ to be synonymous terms. This is, without doubt, a deplorable\r\nand alarming symptom of the decline of society; but we are obliged to\r\nconfess its existence, and, not possessing the power of changing, we\r\nmust submit to its caprices and satisfy its necessities.\r\n\r\nNow, whether from instinct or observation, writers appear for some years\r\npast to have generally understood the demands of the age; and throughout\r\nEurope, men of distinguished talents have employed themselves in\r\nanswering them. It might be said that Germany, England, Switzerland, and\r\nItaly, have formed as it were a literary alliance, which will probably\r\nendure longer than their _political alliance_. As to France, her\r\nattention has for fifteen years been attracted to literature as well as\r\nto politics; but she has thought it sufficient for her glory to\r\ntranslate foreign books, and for her prosperity to translate foreign\r\nconstitutions.[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] In this assertion we do not agree with the critic.\r\n      France, in common with other European nations, has\r\n      unquestionably manifested much curiosity regarding\r\n      foreign literature, and has availed herself of its\r\n      treasures; but, by the original works of her own\r\n      writers, the advantage has been reciprocated,\r\n      particularly in the novels lately produced in Paris by\r\n      such men as M. de Vigny and M. Victor Hugo. The \xe2\x80\x9cNotre\r\n      Dame de Paris\xe2\x80\x9d of the latter has attained an European\r\n      celebrity, and has accordingly been incorporated in\r\n      the present series of \xe2\x80\x9cStandard Novels.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_English\r\n      Ed._\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the new taste for foreign literature is remarkable.\r\nNumerous works of imagination have appeared simultaneously of an\r\nelevated style and uncommon erudition. The choice, and we may add the\r\ngravity, of the subjects, the importance of the action, the extent of\r\nthe developements, and the fidelity of the descriptions, stamp them with\r\na peculiar character, and oblige us to assign to their authors a\r\ndistinct rank among novel writers. Although unequal in merit, they may\r\nbe arranged into two classes. The one, beholding how history was\r\nneglected, has endeavoured to restore its influence by reviving our\r\nancient chronicles, and presenting to us in an elegant undress, the same\r\ncharacters from whom we avert our eyes, in the magnificent and stiff\r\naccompaniments of their historical costume. The other, less numerous,\r\nbut, in our opinion, much more happily inspired, afflicted by the cold\r\nindifference with which the most excellent works on morals and politics\r\nare received, or by the insulting contempt which discards them\r\naltogether, has undertaken to allure and amuse the prejudices of the\r\nage, in order to correct them. In an imaginary picture, they have\r\nspecially devoted themselves to describe the great springs of human\r\naction, and to bring prominently forward those traits of character,\r\nthose inflexible criticisms on society, which under such a form will\r\nattract attention, when every direct and serious admonition would be\r\nrejected. Now, it is to this class of novel writers that Alessandro\r\nManzoni essentially belongs.\r\n\r\nAnd here, a great difficulty presents itself; a work of which the action\r\nis so simple, that an analysis of it might be given in half a page, and\r\nyet so rich in beauties, that a volume might be written in its praise;\r\nbetween these two extremes, the middle path is not easy to find. For, if\r\nwe should content ourselves with stating that two villagers, who were\r\nbetrothed, and about to be united, had been separated by the menaces of\r\na rich and titled robber, calumniated, betrayed by a seeming friend, and\r\naided by the unlooked-for benevolence of an enemy; again persecuted by\r\nthe tyranny of the great, and then almost immolated by the tyranny of\r\nthe people, and finally delivered by the pestilence itself; if, we\r\nrepeat, we confine ourselves to this exposition, we shall have presented\r\nto our readers the abstract of the work; but shall we have given them a\r\nsingle idea of its beauties?\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, we would enter on an examination of the characters,\r\nand follow them in their developement, what a task we impose on\r\nourselves! For here, what beauty! what truth! what originality! The\r\ncharacter of Don Abbondio alone would furnish matter for extensive\r\nremark, as it is assuredly one of the most profoundly comic creations of\r\nthe genius of romance. A coward by nature, and selfish from habit,\r\nentering the ecclesiastical order only to find in it powerful protection\r\nagainst future enemies, and a refuge against present terrors, during his\r\nwhole life he pursues, without a single deviation, the tyrannical\r\nvocation of _fear_. Ever disturbed by the apprehension of being\r\ndisturbed, and giving himself prodigious trouble in order to secure his\r\ntranquillity, the care of his repose takes from him all repose. \xe2\x80\x9c_A\r\nfriend to all_,\xe2\x80\x9d is his device, and \xe2\x80\x9c_Be quiet_,\xe2\x80\x9d his habitual reply.\r\nFor him, the evil committed in secret is preferable to the good which\r\nmight excite dangerous remark. However, at the bottom of his heart, he\r\nstill esteems the good and virtuous; as to the wicked, he caresses, and\r\nwhere there is necessity, flatters them; in every controversy, he deems\r\nthe strongest party to be in the right, but his fear of mistake often\r\nprevents him from deciding which _is_ the strongest. In discussions\r\nwhere he is personally involved, he acts not less prudently; he does not\r\ngrant concessions, he does more, he freely offers them, as by so doing\r\nhe saves the honour of his authority. Indeed, he does not drop a word\r\nnor risk a gesture, of which he has not previously weighed the\r\nconsequences. So that by calculation and foresight, he is prepared for\r\nall, except the performance of duty under circumstances of peril and\r\ndifficulty; to this he closes his ears and his eyes, and thus\r\ncompromises with the world and his conscience.\r\n\r\nAnd here, let us add, that if any of our readers discover, in this\r\ncharacter, the intention, or even the possibility, of an application\r\ninjurious to religion, they understand but little the mind of the\r\nauthor, which is constantly animated by the most ardent faith, and\r\nimbued, we may say, with its highest inspirations. The curate Abbondio\r\nappears before us chiefly to give greater relief to the sublime figures\r\nof the friar Christopher, and the holy archbishop of Milan, and to\r\nfurnish materials for scenes between these three characters, where the\r\nweakness, the cowardice, and the selfishness of the one serves to\r\nbrighten, by contrast, the courage, devotion, and heroism of the others.\r\nIt is an eminently philosophical conception to portray three men\r\nentering the priesthood from such different motives, in the course of\r\ntheir long lives, disclosing faithfully in their actions, the sources of\r\ntheir primitive choice. A lesson indeed! from which we may learn what\r\nreligion can do with men, when they obey its laws and devote themselves\r\nto its service, and what men can do with religion, when they subject it\r\nto their caprices, or prostitute it to their interests.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the conversion of the formidable Unknown, that religion\r\nappears in all its power, and its pontiff in all the majesty of his\r\nbenevolence. The interview between these two persons, the one the\r\nterror, the other the beloved of his country; the proud criminal\r\nhumbling himself before the most humble of the just; the former\r\npreserving in his profound humiliation the traces of his habitual\r\nwickedness and pride, and the latter, with humility equally profound,\r\nthe majestic authority of unsullied virtue. This scene, conceived and\r\nexecuted with equal genius, combines within itself the deepest interest,\r\nand the highest beauty.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the ingenuity and discernment of the author, we\r\nwill offer one remark further; he has placed before us two wicked men;\r\nthe one a subaltern robber, a libertine of the second rank, a swaggerer\r\nin debauch, vainer of his vices than jealous of his pleasures. The other\r\na superior genius, who has measured how far man could descend in crime,\r\nand himself reached its depths, where he governs human corruption as its\r\nsovereign, committing no act of violence without leaving the impression\r\nof his unlimited power and inexorable will. One of these is to be\r\nconverted; which will it be? The least guilty? No; coward in vice, where\r\nwould he find courage to repent? He will die hardened and impenitent. It\r\nis the grand criminal who will be drawn from the abyss, for he has\r\ndescended into it with all his power, and it will need a repentance\r\nproportioned to the measure of his iniquities to restore him to the\r\nfavour of his God. There is evinced in this developement, great\r\nknowledge of the human heart, and a very striking revelation of the\r\nmysterious dealings of a just and compassionate God.\r\n\r\nWe find the same sagacity of observation in other parts of the work; it\r\nappears under an altogether original form in the episode of Gertrude;\r\nirresistibly conducted to the cloister, notwithstanding her\r\ninsurmountable repugnance, when she could by a single word free herself\r\nfrom such a condemnation, dooming her own self to a sacrifice she\r\ndetests; yielding without having been conquered; the slave of her very\r\nliberty, and the victim to a voluntary fatality! It is not in a rapid\r\nsketch that we can give an idea of this singular and altogether novel\r\ncharacter. To appreciate its excellence, we must give an attentive\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\nBut Alessandro Manzoni is not only a skilful painter of individual\r\nportraits, he excels also in grand historical representations. In that\r\nof the plague at Milan, and the famine preceding it, his manner becomes\r\nbolder, his touch more free and majestic, without, however, losing any\r\nof its exquisite delicacy. When he represents an entire people rebelling\r\nagainst hunger, or vanquished by disease and death, we deeply feel the\r\nhorror of the picture, at the same time that an occasional smile is\r\nelicited by the comic genius of the artist, which exercises itself even\r\namidst the agonies of famine and pestilence, so that, through the grand\r\ndesign of the exhibition, the delicate touches of the pencil are still\r\nvisible, and individual character perceptible through the very depths of\r\nbold and general description; it is Van Dyck painting on the reverse of\r\none of Michael Angelo\xe2\x80\x99s pictures.\r\n\r\nWe will not take leave of this interesting production without indulging\r\nourselves in one more observation, which is, that in this succession of\r\nadventures, where appear, by turns or simultaneously, two robber chiefs\r\nand their followers, an unbridled soldiery, a people in rebellion,\r\nfamine, and pestilence, all the evil specially resulting to the\r\nvirtuous, is the consequence of the cowardice of a single man! What a\r\nlesson may we derive from such a _Novel_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BETROTHED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat branch of the Lake of Como, which turns toward the south between\r\ntwo unbroken chains of mountains, presenting to the eye a succession of\r\nbays and gulfs, formed by their jutting and retiring ridges, suddenly\r\ncontracts itself between a headland to the right and an extended sloping\r\nbank on the left, and assumes the flow and appearance of a river. The\r\nbridge by which the two shores are here united, appears to render the\r\ntransformation more apparent, and marks the point at which the lake\r\nceases, and the Adda recommences, to resume, however, the name of _Lake_\r\nwhere the again receding banks allow the water to expand itself anew\r\ninto bays and gulfs. The bank, formed by the deposit of three large\r\nmountain streams, descends from the bases of two contiguous mountains,\r\nthe one called St. Martin, the other by a Lombard name, _Resegone_, from\r\nits long line of summits, which in truth give it the appearance of a\r\nsaw; so that there is no one who would not at first sight, especially\r\nviewing it in front, from the ramparts of Milan that face the north, at\r\nonce distinguish it in all that extensive range from other mountains of\r\nless name and more ordinary form. The bank, for a considerable distance,\r\nrises with a gentle and continual ascent, then breaks into hills and\r\nhollows, rugged or level land, according to the formation of the\r\nmountain rocks, and the action of the floods. Its extreme border,\r\nintersected by the mountain torrents, is composed almost entirely of\r\nsand and pebbles; the other parts of fields and vineyards, scattered\r\nfarms, country seats, and villages, with here and there a wood which\r\nextends up the mountain side. Lecco, the largest of these villages, and\r\nwhich gives its name to the district, is situated at no great distance\r\nfrom the bridge, upon the margin of the lake; nay, often, at the rising\r\nof the waters, is partly embosomed within the lake itself; a large town\r\nat the present day, and likely soon to become a city. At the period of\r\nour story, this village was also fortified, and consequently had the\r\nhonour to furnish quarters to a governor, and the advantage of\r\npossessing a permanent garrison of Spanish soldiers, who gave lessons in\r\nmodesty to the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood, and toward the\r\nclose of summer never failed to scatter themselves through the\r\nvineyards, in order to thin the grapes, and lighten for the rustics the\r\nlabours of the vintage. From village to village, from the heights down\r\nto the margin of the lake, there are innumerable roads and paths: these\r\nvary in their character; at times precipitous, at others level; now sunk\r\nand buried between two ivy-clad walls, from whose depth you can behold\r\nnothing but the sky, or some lofty mountain peak; then crossing high and\r\nlevel tracts, around the edges of which they sometimes wind,\r\noccasionally projecting beyond the face of the mountain, supported by\r\nprominent masses resembling bastions, whence the eye wanders over the\r\nmost varied and delicious landscape. On the one side you behold the blue\r\nlake, with its boundaries broken by various promontories and necks of\r\nland, and reflecting the inverted images of the objects on its banks; on\r\nthe other, the Adda, which, flowing beneath the arches of the bridge,\r\nexpands into a small lake, then contracts again, and holds on its clear\r\nserpentining course to the distant horizon: above, are the ponderous\r\nmasses of the shapeless rocks; beneath, the richly cultivated acclivity,\r\nthe fair landscape, the bridge; in front, the opposite shore of the\r\nlake, and beyond this, the mountain, which bounds the view.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, on the 7th day of November, 1628, Don Abbondio, curate\r\nof one of the villages before alluded to (but of the name of which, nor\r\nof the house and lineage of its curate, we are not informed), was\r\nreturning slowly towards his home, by one of these pathways. He was\r\nrepeating quietly his office; in the pauses of which he held his closed\r\nbreviary in his hand behind his back; and as he went, with his foot he\r\ncast listlessly against the wall the stones that happened to impede his\r\npath; at the same time giving admittance to the idle thoughts that\r\ntempted the spirit, while the lips of the worthy man were mechanically\r\nperforming their function; then raising his head and gazing idly around\r\nhim, he fixed his eyes upon a mountain summit, where the rays of the\r\nsetting sun, breaking through the openings of an opposite ridge,\r\nillumined its projecting masses, which appeared like large and variously\r\nshaped spots of purple light. He then opened anew his breviary, and\r\nrecited another portion at an angle of the lane, after which angle the\r\nroad continued straight for perhaps seventy paces, and then branched\r\nlike the letter Y into two narrow paths; the right-hand one ascended\r\ntowards the mountain, and led to the parsonage (_Cura_); that on the\r\nleft descended the valley towards a torrent, and on this side the wall\r\nrose out to the height of about two feet. The inner walls of the two\r\nnarrow paths, instead of meeting at the angle, ended in a little chapel,\r\nupon which were depicted certain long, sinuous, pointed shapes, which,\r\nin the intention of the artist, and to the eyes of the neighbouring\r\ninhabitants, represented flames, and amidst these flames certain other\r\nforms, not to be described, that were meant for souls in purgatory;\r\nsouls and flames of a brick colour, upon a ground of blackish grey, with\r\nhere and there a bare spot of plaster. The curate, having turned the\r\ncorner, directed, as was his wont, a look toward the little chapel, and\r\nthere beheld what he little expected, and would not have desired to see.\r\nAt the confluence, if we may so call it, of the two narrow lanes, there\r\nwere two men: one of them sitting astride the low wall; his companion\r\nleaning against it, with his arms folded on his breast. The dress, the\r\nbearing, and what the curate could distinguish of the countenance of\r\nthese men, left no doubt as to their profession. They wore upon their\r\nheads a green network, which, falling on the left shoulder, ended in a\r\nlarge tassel, from under which appeared upon the forehead an enormous\r\nlock of hair. Their mustachios were long, and curled at the extremities;\r\nthe margin of their doublets confined by a belt of polished leather,\r\nfrom which were suspended, by hooks, two pistols; a little powder-horn\r\nhung like a locket on the breast; on the right-hand side of the wide and\r\nample breeches was a pocket, out of which projected the handle of a\r\nknife, and on the other side they bore a long sword, of which the great\r\nhollow hilt was formed of bright plates of brass, combined into a\r\ncypher: by these characteristics they were, at a glance, recognised as\r\nindividuals of the class of bravoes.\r\n\r\nThis species, now entirely extinct, flourished greatly at that time in\r\nLombardy. For those who have no knowledge of it, the following are a few\r\nauthentic records, that may suffice to impart an idea of its principal\r\ncharacteristics, of the vigorous efforts made to extirpate it, and of\r\nits obstinate and rank vitality.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 8th of April, 1583, the most illustrious and most\r\nexcellent lord Don Charles of Arragon, Prince of Castelvetrano, Duke of\r\nTerranova, Marquis of Avola, Count of Burgeto, High Admiral and High\r\nConstable of Sicily, Governor of Milan, and Captain General of His\r\nCatholic Majesty in Italy, \xe2\x80\x9cfully informed of the intolerable misery\r\nwhich the city of Milan has endured, and still endures, by reason of\r\nbravoes and vagabonds,\xe2\x80\x9d publishes his decree against them, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclares and\r\ndesignates all those comprehended in this proclamation to be regarded as\r\nbravoes and vagabonds,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94who, whether foreigners or natives, have no\r\ncalling, or, having one, do not follow it,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94but, either with or\r\nwithout wages, attach themselves to any knight, gentleman, officer, or\r\nmerchant,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94to uphold or favour him, or in any manner to molest\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d All such he commands, within the space of six days, to leave\r\nthe country; threatens the refractory with the galleys, and grants to\r\nall officers of justice the most ample and unlimited powers for the\r\nexecution of his commands. But, in the following year, on the 12th of\r\nApril, the said lord, having perceived \xe2\x80\x9cthat this city still continues\r\nto be filled with bravoes, who have again resumed their former mode of\r\nlife; their manners unchanged, and their number undiminished,\xe2\x80\x9d puts\r\nforth another edict still more energetic and remarkable, in which, among\r\nother regulations, he directs \xe2\x80\x9cthat any person whatsoever, whether of\r\nthis city or from abroad, who shall, by the testimony of two witnesses,\r\nbe shown to be regarded and commonly reputed as a bravo, even though no\r\ncriminal act shall have been proved against him, may, nevertheless, upon\r\nthe sole ground of his reputation, be condemned by the said judges to\r\nthe rack for examination; and although he make no confession of guilt,\r\nhe shall, notwithstanding, be sentenced to the galleys for the said term\r\nof three years, solely for that he is regarded as, and called a bravo,\r\nas above-mentioned;\xe2\x80\x9d and this \xe2\x80\x9cbecause His Excellency is resolved to\r\nenforce obedience to his commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that at the sound of such denunciations from so\r\npowerful a source, all the bravoes must have disappeared for ever. But\r\ntestimony, of no less authority, obliges us to believe directly the\r\nreverse. This testimony is the most illustrious and most excellent lord\r\nJuan Fernandez de Velasco, Constable of Castile, High Chamberlain of His\r\nMajesty, Duke of the city of Freas, Count of Haro and Castelnuovo, Lord\r\nof the house of Velasco, and of that of the Seven Infanti of Lara,\r\nGovernor of the State of Milan, &c. On the 5th of June, 1593, he also,\r\nfully informed \xe2\x80\x9chow great an injury to the common weal, and how\r\ninsulting to justice, is the existence of such a class of men,\xe2\x80\x9d requires\r\nthem anew to quit the country within six days, repeating very nearly the\r\nsame threats and injunctions as his predecessor. On the 23d of May,\r\nthen, 1598, \xe2\x80\x9chaving learnt, with no little displeasure, that the number\r\nof bravoes and vagabonds is increasing daily in this state and city, and\r\nthat nothing is heard of them but wounds, murders, robberies, and every\r\nother crime, to the commission of which these bravoes are encouraged by\r\nthe confidence that they will be sustained by their chiefs and\r\nabettors,\xe2\x80\x9d he prescribes again the same remedies, increasing the dose,\r\nas is usual in obstinate disorders. \xe2\x80\x9cLet every one, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he concludes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccarefully beware that he do not, in any wise, contravene this edict;\r\nsince, in place of experiencing the mercy of His Excellency, he shall\r\nprove his rigour and his wrath\xe2\x80\x94he being resolved and determined that\r\nthis shall be a final and peremptory warning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this again did not suffice; and the illustrious and most excellent\r\nlord, the Signor Don Pietro Enriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes,\r\nCaptain and Governor of the State of Milan, \xe2\x80\x9cfully informed of the\r\nwretched condition of this city and state, in consequence of the great\r\nnumber of bravoes that abound therein, and resolved wholly to extirpate\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d publishes, on the 5th of December, 1600, a new decree, full of\r\nthe most rigorous provisions, and \xe2\x80\x9cwith firm purpose that in all rigour,\r\nand without hope of remission, they shall be wholly carried into\r\nexecution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe are obliged, however, to conclude that he did not, in this matter,\r\nexhibit the same zeal which he knew how to employ in contriving plots\r\nand exciting enemies against his powerful foe, Henry IV., against whom\r\nhistory attests that he succeeded in arming the Duke of Savoy, whom he\r\ncaused to lose more towns than one; and in engaging in a conspiracy the\r\nDuke of Biron, whom he caused to lose his head. But as regards the\r\npestilent race of bravoes, it is very certain they continued to increase\r\nuntil the 22d day of September, 1612; on which day the most illustrious\r\nand most excellent lord Don Giovanni de Mendoza, Marchese de la\r\nHynojosa, gentleman, &c., Governor, &c., thought seriously of their\r\nextirpation. He addressed to Pandolfo and Marco Tullio Malatesti,\r\nprinters of the Royal Chamber, the customary edict, corrected and\r\nenlarged, that they might print it, to accomplish that end. But the\r\nbravoes still survived, to experience, on the 24th December, 1618, still\r\nmore terrific denunciations from the most illustrious and most excellent\r\nlord, Don Gomez Suarez de Figueroa, Duke of Feria, Governor, &c.; yet,\r\nas they did not fall even under these blows, the most illustrious and\r\nmost excellent lord Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, under whose government\r\nwe are made acquainted with Don Abbondio, found himself obliged to\r\nrepublish the usual proclamation against the bravoes, on the 5th day of\r\nOctober, 1627, that is, a year, a month, and two days previous to the\r\ncommencement of our story.\r\n\r\nNor was this the last publication; but of those that follow, as of\r\nmatters not falling within the period of our history, we do not think it\r\nproper to make mention. The only one of them to which we shall refer, is\r\nthat of the 13th day of February, 1632, in which the most illustrious\r\nand most excellent lord, the Duke of Feria, for the second time\r\ngovernor, informs us, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the greatest and most heinous crimes are\r\nperpetrated by those styled bravoes.\xe2\x80\x9d This will suffice to prove that,\r\nat the time of which we treat, the bravoes still existed.\r\n\r\nIt appeared evident to Don Abbondio that the two men above mentioned\r\nwere waiting for some one, and he was alarmed at the conviction that it\r\nwas for himself; for on his appearance, they exchanged a look, as if to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis he.\xe2\x80\x9d Rising from the wall, they both advanced to meet him. He\r\nheld his breviary open before him, as though he were employed in reading\r\nit; but, nevertheless, cast a glance upward in order to espy their\r\nmovements. Seeing that they came directly toward him, he was beset by a\r\nthousand different thoughts. He considered, in haste, whether between\r\nthe bravoes and himself there were any outlet from the road, and he\r\nremembered there was none. He took a rapid survey of his conduct, to\r\ndiscover if he had given offence to any powerful or revengeful man; but\r\nin this matter, he was somewhat reassured by the consoling testimony of\r\nhis conscience. The bravoes draw near, and kept their eyes upon him. He\r\nraised his hand to his collar, as if adjusting it, and at the same time\r\nturned his head round, to see if any one were coming; he could discover\r\nno one. He cast a glance across the low stone wall upon the fields; no\r\none! another on the road that lay before him; no one, except the\r\nbravoes! What is to be done? Flight was impossible. Unable to avoid the\r\ndanger, he hastened to encounter it, and to put an end to the torments\r\nof uncertainty. He quickened his pace, recited a stanza in a louder\r\ntone, did his utmost to assume a composed and cheerful countenance, and\r\nfinding himself in front of the two gallants, stopped short. \xe2\x80\x9cSignor\r\nCurate,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, fixing his eyes upon him,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pleasure, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly raising his eyes from his book, which he\r\ncontinued to hold open before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou intend,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other, with the threatening and angry mien of\r\none who has detected an inferior in an attempt to commit some villany,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou intend to-morrow to unite in marriage Renzo Tramaglino and Lucy\r\nMondella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio with a faltering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is to\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94you gentlemen, being men of the world, are very well aware how\r\nthese things are managed: the poor curate neither meddles nor\r\nmakes\xe2\x80\x94they settle their affairs amongst themselves, and then\xe2\x80\x94then,\r\nthey come to us, as if to redeem a pledge; and we\xe2\x80\x94we are the servants\r\nof the public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bravo in a low voice, but in a tone of command,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis marriage is not to take place, neither to-morrow, nor at any other\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my good sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio, with the mild and gentle tone\r\nof one who would persuade an impatient listener, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, my good sirs,\r\ndeign to put yourselves in my situation. If the thing depended on\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94you see plainly, that it does not in the least concern\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bravo, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cthis matter is not to\r\nbe settled by prating. We neither know nor care to know any more about\r\nit. A man once warned\xe2\x80\x94you understand us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, fair sirs, you are too just, too reasonable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the other comrade, who had not before spoken, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthis marriage is not to be performed, or (with an oath) he who performs\r\nit will not repent of it, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll not have time\xe2\x80\x9d (with another\r\noath).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the first orator, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Signor Curate knows the\r\nworld, and we are gentlemen who have no wish to harm him if he conducts\r\nhimself with judgment. Signor Curate, the most illustrious Signor Don\r\nRoderick, our patron, offers you his kind regards.\xe2\x80\x9d As in the height of\r\na midnight storm a vivid flash casts a momentary dazzling glare around\r\nand renders every object more fearful, so did this _name_ increase the\r\nterror of Don Abbondio: as if by instinct, he bowed his head\r\nsubmissively, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it could but be suggested to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! suggested to _you_, who understand Latin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the bravo,\r\nlaughing; \xe2\x80\x9cit is for you to manage the matter. But, above all, be\r\ncareful not to say a word concerning the hint that has been given you\r\nfor your good; for if you do, ehem!\xe2\x80\x94you understand\xe2\x80\x94the consequences\r\nwould be the same as if you performed the marriage ceremony. But say,\r\nwhat answer are we to carry in your name to the most illustrious Signor\r\nDon Roderick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy respects\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak more clearly, Signor Curate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am disposed, ever disposed, to obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d And as he spoke the\r\nwords he was not very certain himself whether he gave a promise, or only\r\nuttered an ordinary compliment. The bravoes took, or _appeared_ to take\r\nthem, in the more serious sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis very well; good night, Signor Curate,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them as he\r\nretired, together with his companion. Don Abbondio, who a few minutes\r\nbefore would have given one of his eyes to avoid the ruffians, was now\r\ndesirous to prolong the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began, as he shut his book. Without again noticing\r\nhim, however, they passed on, singing a loose song, of which we will not\r\ntranscribe the words. Poor Don Abbondio remained for a moment, as if\r\nspell-bound, and then with heavy and lagging steps took the path which\r\nled towards his home. The reader will better understand the state of his\r\nmind, when he shall have learned something more of his disposition, and\r\nof the condition of the times in which it was his lot to live.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio was not (as the reader may have perceived) endowed with the\r\ncourage of a lion. But from his earliest years he had been sensible that\r\nthe most embarrassing situation in those times was that of an animal,\r\nfurnished with neither tusks nor talons, at the same time having no wish\r\nto be devoured. The arm of the law afforded no protection to a man of\r\nquiet, inoffensive habits, who had no means of making himself feared.\r\nNot that laws and penalties were wanting for the prevention of private\r\nviolence: the laws were most express; the offences enumerated, and\r\nminutely particularised; the penalties sufficiently extravagant; and if\r\nthat were not enough, the legislator himself, and, a hundred others to\r\nwhom was committed the execution of the laws, had power to increase\r\nthem. The proceedings were studiously contrived to free the judge from\r\nevery thing that might prevent his passing sentence of condemnation; the\r\npassages we have cited from proclamations against the bravoes, may be\r\ntaken as a faithful specimen of these decrees. Notwithstanding this, or,\r\nit may be, in _consequence_ of this, these proclamations, reiterated and\r\nreinforced from time to time, served only to proclaim in pompous\r\nlanguage the impotence of those who issued them; or, if they produced\r\nany immediate effect, it was _that_ of adding to the vexations which the\r\npeaceful and feeble suffered from the disturbers of society. Impunity\r\nwas organised and effected in so many ways as to render the\r\nproclamations powerless. Such was the consequence of the sanctuaries and\r\nasylums; and of the privileges of certain classes, partly acknowledged\r\nby the legal power, partly tolerated in silence, or feebly opposed; but\r\nwhich, in _fact_, were sustained and guarded by almost every individual\r\nwith interested activity and punctilious jealousy. Now this impunity,\r\nthreatened and assailed, but not destroyed, by these proclamations,\r\nwould naturally, at every new attack, employ fresh efforts and devices\r\nto maintain itself. The proclamations were efficient, it is true, in\r\nfettering and embarrassing the honest man, who had neither power in\r\nhimself nor protection from others; inasmuch as, in order to reach every\r\nperson, they subjected the movements of each private individual to the\r\narbitrary will of a thousand magistrates and executive officers. But he,\r\nwho before the commission of his crime had prepared himself a refuge in\r\nsome convent or palace where bailiffs never dared to enter; or who\r\nsimply wore a livery, which engaged in his defence the vanity or the\r\ninterest of a powerful family; such a one was free in his actions, and\r\ncould laugh to scorn every proclamation. Of those very persons whose\r\npart it was to ensure the execution of these decrees, some belonged by\r\nbirth to the privileged class, others were its clients and dependants;\r\nand as the latter as well as the former had, from education, from habit,\r\nfrom imitation, embraced its maxims, they would be very careful not to\r\nviolate them. Had they however, been bold as heroes, obedient as monks,\r\nand devoted as martyrs, they could never have accomplished the execution\r\nof the laws, inferior as they were in number to _those_ with whom they\r\nmust engage, and with the frequent probability of being abandoned, or\r\neven sacrificed, by him who, in a moment of theoretical abstraction,\r\nmight require them to act. But, in addition to this, their office would\r\nbe regarded as a base one in public opinion, and their name stamped with\r\nreproach. It was therefore very natural that, instead of risking, nay,\r\nthrowing away, their lives in a fruitless attempt, they should sell\r\ntheir inaction, or, rather, their connivance, to the powerful; or, at\r\nleast, exercise their authority only on those occasions when it might be\r\ndone with safety to themselves; that is, in oppressing the peaceable and\r\nthe defenceless.\r\n\r\nThe man who acts with violence, or who is constantly in fear of violence\r\nfrom others, seeks companions and allies. Hence it happened that, during\r\nthese times, individuals displayed so strong a tendency to combine\r\nthemselves into classes, and to advance, as far as each one was able,\r\nthe power of that to which he belonged. The clergy was vigilant in the\r\ndefence and extension of its immunities; the nobility, of its\r\nprivileges; the military, of its exemptions; the merchants and artisans\r\nwere enrolled in companies and fraternities; the lawyers were united in\r\nleagues, and even the physicians formed a corporation. Each of these\r\nlittle oligarchies had its own appropriate power,\xe2\x80\x94in each of them the\r\nindividual found the advantage of employing for himself, in proportion\r\nto his influence and dexterity, the united force of numbers. The more\r\nhonest availed themselves of this advantage merely for their defence;\r\nthe crafty and the wicked profited by it to assure themselves of success\r\nin their rogueries, and impunity from their results. The strength,\r\nhowever, of these various combinations was far from being equal; and,\r\nespecially in the country, the wealthy and overbearing nobleman, with a\r\nband of bravoes, and surrounded by peasants accustomed to regard\r\nthemselves as subjects and soldiers of their lord, exercised an\r\nirresistible power, and set all laws at defiance.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio, neither noble, rich, nor valiant, had from early youth\r\nfound himself alone and unaided in such a state of society, like an\r\nearthen vessel thrown amidst iron jars; he therefore readily obeyed his\r\nparents, who wished him to become a priest. He did, to say the truth,\r\nnot regard the obligations and the noble ends of the ministry to which\r\nhe dedicated himself, but was only desirous to secure the means of\r\nliving, and to connect himself with a powerful and respected class. But\r\nno class provided for the individual, or secured his safety, _further_\r\nthan to a certain point; none rendered it unnecessary for him to adopt\r\nfor himself a system of his own. The system of Don Abbondio consisted\r\nchiefly in shunning all disputes; he maintained an unarmed neutrality in\r\nall the contests that broke out around him;\xe2\x80\x94between the clergy and the\r\ncivil power, between persons in office and nobles and magistrates,\r\nbravoes and soldiers, down to the squabbles of the peasantry themselves,\r\nterminated by the fist or the knife. By keeping aloof from the\r\noverbearing, by affecting not to notice their acts of violence, by\r\nbowing low and with the most profound respect to all whom he met, the\r\npoor man had succeeded in passing over sixty years without encountering\r\nany violent storms; not but that he also had some small portion of gall\r\nin his composition; and this continual exercise of patience exacerbated\r\nit to such a degree, that, if he had not had it in his power\r\noccasionally to give it vent, his health must have suffered. But as\r\nthere were a few persons in the world connected with himself whom he\r\nknew to be powerless, he could, from time to time, discharge on them his\r\nlong pent-up ill-humour. He was, moreover, a severe censor of those who\r\ndid not regulate their conduct by his example, provided he could censure\r\nwithout danger. According to his creed, the poor fellow who had been\r\ncudgelled had been a little imprudent; the murdered man had always been\r\nturbulent; the man who maintained his right against the powerful, and\r\nmet with a broken head, must have been somewhat wrong; which is,\r\nperhaps, true enough, for in all disputes the line can never be drawn\r\nso finely as not to leave a little wrong on both sides. He especially\r\ndeclaimed against those of his confraternity, who, at their own risk,\r\ntook part with the oppressed against a powerful oppressor. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to purchase trouble with ready money, to kick at snarling\r\ndogs, and an intermeddling in profane things that lowered the dignity of\r\nthe sacred ministry.\xe2\x80\x9d He had, in short, a favourite maxim, that an\r\nhonest man, who looked to himself and minded his own affairs, never met\r\nwith any rough encounters.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, we may imagine the effect the meeting just\r\ndescribed must have had upon the mind of poor Don Abbondio. Those fierce\r\ncountenances, the threats of a lord who was well known not to speak\r\nidly, his plan of quiet life and patient endurance disconcerted in an\r\ninstant, a difficulty before him from which he saw no possibility of\r\nextrication; all these thoughts rushed confusedly through his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nRenzo could be quietly dismissed with a refusal, all would be well; but\r\nhe will require reasons\xe2\x80\x94and what can I say to him? he too has a head of\r\nhis own; a lamb, if not meddled with\xe2\x80\x94but once attempt to cross him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nOh!\xe2\x80\x94and raving after that Lucy, as much enamoured as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Young idiots!\r\nwho, for want of something else to do, fall in love, and must be\r\nmarried, forsooth, thinking of nothing else, never concerning themselves\r\nabout the trouble they bring upon an honest man like me. Wretch that I\r\nam! Why should those two scowling faces plant themselves exactly in my\r\npath, and pick a quarrel with me? What have I to do in the matter? Is it\r\nI that mean to wive? Why did they not rather go and speak\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Ah! truly,\r\nthat which is to the purpose always occurs to me after the right time:\r\nif I had but thought of suggesting to them to go and bear their\r\nmessage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But here he was disturbed by the reflection, that to repent\r\nof not having been the counsellor and abettor of evil, was too\r\niniquitous a thing; and he therefore turned the rancour of his thoughts\r\nagainst the individual who had thus robbed him of his tranquillity. He\r\ndid not know Don Roderick, except by sight and by report; his sole\r\nintercourse with him had been to touch chin to breast, and the ground\r\nwith the corner of his hat, the few times he had met him on the road.\r\nHe had, on more than one occasion, defended the reputation of that\r\nSignor against those who, in an under-tone, with sighs and looks raised\r\nto heaven, had execrated some one of his exploits. He had declared a\r\nhundred times that he was a respectable cavalier. But at this moment he,\r\nin his own heart, readily bestowed upon him all those titles to which he\r\nwould never lend an ear from another. Having, amidst the tumult of these\r\nthoughts, reached the entrance of his house, which stood at the end of\r\nthe little glebe, he unlocked the door, entered, and carefully secured\r\nit within. Anxious to find himself in society that he could trust, he\r\ncalled aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua, Perpetua,\xe2\x80\x9d advancing towards the little parlour\r\nwhere she was, doubtless, employed in preparing the table for his\r\nsupper. Perpetua was, as the reader must be aware, the housekeeper of\r\nDon Abbondio; an affectionate and faithful domestic, who knew how to\r\nobey or command as occasion served; to bear the grumbling and whims of\r\nher master at times, and at others to make him bear with hers. These\r\nwere becoming every day more frequent; she had passed the age of forty\r\nin a single state; the consequences, _she_ said, of having refused all\r\nthe offers that had been made her; her _female friends_ asserted that\r\nshe had never found any one willing to take her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, as she set in its usual place on the little\r\ntable the flask of Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s favourite wine, and moved slowly\r\ntoward the parlour door: before she reached it he entered, with steps so\r\ndisordered, looks so clouded, and a countenance so changed, that an eye\r\nless practised than that of Perpetua could have discovered at a glance\r\nthat something unusual had befallen him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on me! What is it ails my master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, as he sank upon his easy chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, nothing! Would you have me believe that, looking as you do? Some\r\ndreadful accident has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for the love of Heaven! When I say nothing, it is either nothing,\r\nor something I cannot tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you cannot tell, not even to me? Who will take care of your\r\nhealth? Who will give you advice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! peace, peace! Do not make matters worse. Give me a glass of my\r\nwine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will still pretend to me that nothing is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPerpetua, filling the glass, but retaining it in her hand, as if\r\nunwilling to present it except as the reward of confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive here, give here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, taking the glass with an\r\nunsteady hand, and hastily swallowing its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you oblige me then to go about, asking here and there what it is\r\nhas happened to my master?\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, standing upright before him,\r\nwith her hands on her sides, and looking him steadfastly in the face, as\r\nif to extract the secret from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of Heaven, do not worry me, do not kill me with your\r\npother; this is a matter that concerns\xe2\x80\x94concerns my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know well, that, when you have frankly confided in me, I have\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, forsooth, as when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerpetua was sensible she had touched a false string; wherefore,\r\nchanging suddenly her note, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear master,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a moving tone\r\nof voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have always had a dutiful regard for you, and if I now wish\r\nto know this affair, it is from zeal, and a desire to assist you, to\r\ngive you advice, to relieve your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s desire to disburden himself of his\r\npainful secret was as great as that of Perpetua to obtain a knowledge of\r\nit; so that, after having repulsed, more and more feebly, her renewed\r\nassaults; after having made her swear many times that she would not\r\nbreathe a syllable of it, he, with frequent pauses and exclamations,\r\nrelated his miserable adventure. When it was necessary to pronounce the\r\ndread name of him from whom the prohibition came, he required from\r\nPerpetua another and more solemn oath: having uttered it, he threw\r\nhimself back on his seat with a heavy sigh, and, in a tone of command,\r\nas well as supplication, exclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perpetua, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a wretch! what a tyrant! Does he\r\nnot fear God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be silent? or do you want to ruin me completely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we are here alone, no one can hear us. But what will my poor master\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, in a peevish tone, \xe2\x80\x9csee the fine\r\nadvice you give me. To ask of me, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do? what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do? as if you\r\nwere the one in difficulty, and it was for me to help you out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I could give you my own poor opinion; but then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but then, let us know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion would be, that, as every one says our archbishop is a saint,\r\na man of courage, and not to be frightened by an ugly phiz, and who will\r\ntake pleasure in upholding a curate against one of these tyrants; I\r\nshould say, and do say, that you had better write him a handsome letter,\r\nto inform him as how\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be silent! will you be silent! Is this advice to offer a poor\r\nman? When I get a pistol bullet in my side\xe2\x80\x94God preserve me!\xe2\x80\x94will the\r\narchbishop take it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! pistol bullets are not given away like sugarplums; and it were\r\nwoful if those dogs should bite every time they bark. If a man knows how\r\nto show his teeth, and make himself feared, they hold him in respect: we\r\nshould not have been brought to such a pass, if you had stood upon your\r\nrights. Now, all come to us (by your good leave) to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be silent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but it is true though, that when the world sees one is\r\nalways ready, in every encounter, to lower\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be silent? Is this a time for such idle talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it to-night; but in the meantime do not be\r\nthe first to harm yourself; to destroy your own health: eat a mouthful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Don Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly I\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it.\r\nI _must_ think of it;\xe2\x80\x9d and he arose, continuing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take nothing,\r\nnothing; I\xe2\x80\x99ve something else to do. But, that this should have fallen\r\nupon me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow at least this other little drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, as she poured\r\nthe wine. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it always restores your stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there wants other medicine than that, other medicine than that,\r\nother medicine than that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took the light, and muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cA pretty business this! To\r\nan honest man like me! And to-morrow, what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d with other\r\nlike exclamations, he went towards his bedchamber. Having reached the\r\ndoor, he stopped a moment, and before he quitted the room, exclaimed,\r\nturning towards Perpetua, with his finger on his lips\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of\r\nHeaven, be silent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related that the Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9 slept soundly the night preceding\r\nthe battle of Rocroi; but then, he was greatly fatigued, and moreover\r\nhad made every arrangement for the morrow. It was not thus with Don\r\nAbbondio; he only knew the morrow would be a day of trouble, and\r\nconsequently passed the night in anxious anticipation. He could not for\r\na moment think of disregarding the menaces of the bravoes, and\r\nsolemnising the marriage. To confide to Renzo the occurrence, and\r\nconsult with him as to the means\xe2\x80\x94God forbid!\xe2\x80\x94He remembered the warning\r\nof the bravo, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to say one word\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94otherwise, _ahem!_ and this\r\ndreadful _ahem_ of the bravo resounded in the ears of Don Abbondio; so\r\nthat he already repented of his communication to Perpetua. To fly was\r\nimpossible\xe2\x80\x94and where _could_ he fly? At the thought, a thousand\r\nobstacles presented themselves.\xe2\x80\x94After long and painful deliberation, he\r\nresolved to endeavour to gain time, by giving Renzo some fanciful\r\nreasons for the postponement of the marriage. He recollected that in a\r\nfew days more the time would arrive, during which marriages were\r\nprohibited. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I can keep this youngster at bay for a few days, I\r\nshall then have two months before me; and in two months who can tell\r\nwhat may happen?\xe2\x80\x9d He thought of various pretexts for his purpose; and\r\nthough they were rather flimsy, he persuaded himself that his authority\r\nwould give them weight, and that his experience would prevail over the\r\nmind of an ignorant youth. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself: \xe2\x80\x9che thinks\r\nof his love, but I think of myself; I am, therefore, the party most\r\ninterested; I must call in all my cunning to assist me. I cannot help\r\nit, young man, if you suffer; I must not be the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d Having somewhat\r\ncomposed his mind with this determination, he at length fell asleep. But\r\nhis dreams, alas! how horrible\xe2\x80\x94bravoes, Don Roderick, Renzo, roads,\r\nrocks, cries, bullets.\r\n\r\nThe arousing from sleep, after a recent misfortune, is a bitter moment;\r\nthe mind at first habitually recurs to its previous tranquillity, but is\r\nsoon depressed by the thought of the contrast that awaits it. When alive\r\nto a sense of his situation, Don Abbondio recapitulated the plans of the\r\nnight, made a better disposal of them, and after having risen, awaited\r\nwith dread and impatience the moment of Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\nLorenzo, or as he was called, Renzo, did not make him wait long; at an\r\nearly hour he presented himself before the curate with the joyful\r\nreadiness of one who was on this day to espouse her whom he loved. He\r\nhad been deprived of his parents in his youth, and now practised the\r\ntrade of a weaver of silk, which was, it might be said, hereditary in\r\nhis family. This trade had once been very lucrative; and although now on\r\nthe decline, a skilful workman might obtain from it a respectable\r\nlivelihood. The continual emigration of the tradesmen, attracted to the\r\nneighbouring states by promises and privileges, left sufficient\r\nemployment for those who remained behind. Besides, Renzo possessed a\r\nsmall farm, which he had cultivated himself when otherwise unoccupied;\r\nso that, for one of his condition, he might be called wealthy: and\r\nalthough the last harvest had been more deficient than the preceding\r\nones, and the evils of famine were beginning to be felt; yet, from the\r\nmoment he had given his heart to Lucy, he had been so economical as to\r\npreserve a sufficiency of all necessaries, and to be in no danger of\r\nwanting bread. He appeared before Don Abbondio gaily dressed, and with a\r\njoyful countenance. The mysterious and perplexed manner of the curate\r\nformed a singular contrast to that of the handsome young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Renzo; but without waiting to answer\r\nhis own question, \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Curate,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to know at what\r\nhour of the day it will be convenient for you that we should be at the\r\nchurch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what day do you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! of what day? do you not remember that this is the day appointed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio, as if he heard it for the first time,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto-day? to-day? be patient, I cannot to-day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot to-day? why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place I am not well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for it; but we shall not detain you long, and you will not\r\nbe much fatigued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then\xe2\x80\x94but then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, what, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifficulties! How can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople should be in our situation, to know how many obstacles there are\r\nto these matters; I am too yielding, I think only of removing\r\nimpediments, of rendering all things easy, and promoting the happiness\r\nof others. To do this I neglect my duty, and am covered with reproaches\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of Heaven, keep me not thus in suspense, but tell me at\r\nonce what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how many formalities are required before the marriage can\r\nbe celebrated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, indeed, know something of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, beginning to grow\r\nangry, \xe2\x80\x9csince you have racked my brains with them abundantly these few\r\ndays back. But are not all things now ready? have you not done all there\r\nwas to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll, all, you expect; but be patient, I tell you. I have been a\r\nblockhead to neglect my duty, that I might not cause pain to others;\xe2\x80\x94we\r\npoor curates\xe2\x80\x94we are, as may be said, ever between a hawk and a buzzard.\r\nI pity you, poor young man! I perceive your impatience, but my\r\nsuperiors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Enough, I have reasons for what I say, but I cannot tell\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94we, however, are sure to suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me what this other formality is, and I will perform it\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how many obstacles stand in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I know any thing of obstacles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cError, conditio, votum, cognatis, crimen, cultus disparitas, vis,\r\nordo.... Si sit affinis....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94how should I understand all this Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe patient, dear Renzo; I am ready to do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94all that depends on me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94I wish to see you satisfied\xe2\x80\x94I wish you well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 And when I think\r\nthat you were so happy, that you wanted nothing when the whim entered\r\nyour head to be married\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat words are these, Signor?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Renzo, with a look of\r\nastonishment and anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, do be patient\xe2\x80\x94I say, I wish to see you happy. In short\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nshort, my dear child, I have not been in fault; I did not make the laws.\r\nBefore concluding a marriage, we are required to search closely that\r\nthere be no obstacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I beseech you, tell me at once what difficulty has occurred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe patient\xe2\x80\x94these are not points to be cleared up in an instant. There\r\n_will_ be nothing, I hope; but whether or not, we must search into the\r\nmatter. The passage is clear and explicit,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98antiquam matrimonium\r\ndenunciet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not hear your Latin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is necessary to explain to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not do this before? Why tell me all was prepared? Why wait\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there now! to reproach me with my kindness! I have hastened every\r\nthing to serve you; but\xe2\x80\x94but there has occurred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94well, well, I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you wish that I should do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe patient for a few days. My dear child, a few days are not eternity;\r\nbe patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long a time then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are coming to a good conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cin fifteen days I will endeavour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen days! Oh! this is something new. To tell me now, on the very\r\nday you yourself appointed for my marriage, that I must wait fifteen\r\ndays! Fifteen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, with a low and angry voice.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio interrupted him, earnestly seizing his hand, and with an\r\nimploring tone beseeching him to be quiet. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry;\r\nfor the love of Heaven! I\xe2\x80\x99ll see, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if in a week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall I say to Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, softening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it has been a mistake of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay also it is my fault; that through too great haste I have made some\r\ngreat blunder: throw all the blame on me. Can I do more than this? Come\r\nin a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then there will be no further difficulties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say a thing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I will be quiet for a week; but be assured, I will be put\r\noff with no further excuses:\xe2\x80\x94for the present, I take my leave.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he departed, making a bow to Don Abbondio less profound than\r\nusual, and giving him a look more expressive than respectful.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart he approached the house of his betrothed, his mind\r\ndwelling on the strange conversation which had just taken place. The\r\ncold and embarrassed reception of Don Abbondio, his constrained and\r\nimpatient air, his mysterious hints, all combined to convince him there\r\nwas still something he had not been willing to communicate. He stopped\r\nfor a moment, debating with himself whether he should not return and\r\ncompel him to be more frank; raising his eyes, however, he beheld\r\nPerpetua entering a little garden a few steps distant from the house. He\r\ncalled to her, quickened his pace, and detaining her at the gate,\r\nendeavoured to enter into discourse with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Perpetua; I expected to have received your congratulations\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it must be as God pleases, my poor Renzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask a favour of you: the Signor Curate has offered reasons I\r\ncannot comprehend; will you explain to me the true cause why he is\r\nunable or unwilling to marry us to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you think then that I know the secrets of my master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right in supposing there was a mystery,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\ncome, Perpetua,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are friends; tell me what you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x94help a poor young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a bad thing to be born poor, my dear Renzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, still more confirmed in his\r\nsuspicions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat is true; but it is not becoming in the clergy to\r\nbehave unjustly to the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Renzo; I can tell you nothing, because\xe2\x80\x94I know nothing. But I\r\ncan assure you my master would not wrong you or any one; and he is not\r\nto blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho then is to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Renzo, carelessly, but listening intently\r\nfor a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you already I know nothing. But I may be allowed to speak\r\nin defence of my master; poor man! if he has erred, it has been through\r\ntoo great kindness. There are in this world men who are overpowerful,\r\nknavish, and who fear not God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverpowerful! knavish!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cthese cannot be his\r\nsuperiors.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with difficulty concealing his increasing\r\nagitation, \xe2\x80\x9ccome, tell me who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you would persuade me to speak, and I must not, because\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nnothing. I will keep silence as faithfully as if I had promised to do\r\nso. You might put me to the torture, and you could not draw any thing\r\nfrom me. Adieu! it is lost time for both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, she re-entered the garden hastily, and shut the gate. Renzo\r\nturned very softly, lest at the noise of his footsteps she might discern\r\nthe road he took: when fairly beyond her hearing, he quickened his\r\nsteps, and in a moment was at the door of Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s house; he\r\nentered, rushed towards the little parlour where he had left him, and\r\nfinding him still there, approached him with a bold and furious manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! eh! what has happened now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this powerful personage?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, with the air of one\r\nresolved to obtain an explicit answer; \xe2\x80\x9cwho is he that forbids me to\r\nmarry Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! what! what!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Don Abbondio, turning pale with surprise.\r\nHe arose from his chair, and made an effort to reach the door. But\r\nRenzo, who expected this movement, was upon his guard; and locking the\r\ndoor, he put the key in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! will you speak now, Signor Curate? Every one knows the affair but\r\nmyself; and, by heavens! I\xe2\x80\x99ll know it too. Who is it, I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRenzo, Renzo, for the love of charity, take care what you do; think of\r\nyour soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must know it at once\xe2\x80\x94this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he placed his hand on\r\nhis dagger, but perhaps without intending it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Abbondio, in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, no more excuses. Speak plainly and quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to know that which I have a right to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I speak, I die. Must I not preserve my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manner of Renzo was so threatening and decided, that Don Abbondio\r\nfelt there was no possibility of disobeying him. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise me\xe2\x80\x94swear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cnever to tell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, tell me quickly his name, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this new adjuration, the poor curate, with the trembling look of a\r\nman who feels the instrument of the dentist in his mouth, feebly\r\narticulated, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, inclining his ear towards him, eager to hear the\r\nrest. \xe2\x80\x9cDon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Roderick!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he hastily, trembling at the sound that escaped\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! dog!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cand how has he done it? what has he said to\r\nyou to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, in an almost contemptuous tone, already\r\ngaining confidence by the sacrifice he had made. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were like\r\nmyself, you would then meddle with nothing, and certainly you would not\r\nhave had so many whims in your head.\xe2\x80\x9d He, however, related in terrible\r\ncolours the ugly encounter; his anger, which had hitherto been subdued\r\nby fear, displayed itself as he proceeded; and perceiving that Renzo,\r\nbetween rage and astonishment, remained motionless, with his head bent\r\ndown, he continued in a lively manner, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made a pretty business\r\nof it, indeed! You have rendered me a notable service. Thus to attack an\r\nhonest man, your curate, in his own house! in a sacred place! You have\r\ndone a fine thing, truly. To wrest from my mouth, that which I\r\nconcealed, from prudence, for your own good. And now that you know it,\r\nwhat will you do? When I gave you good advice this morning, I had\r\njudgment for you and me; but believe me, this is no jesting matter, no\r\nquestion of right or wrong, but superior power. At all events, open the\r\ndoor; give me the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have been to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo with a softened voice, but in\r\nwhich might be perceived smothered anger towards his concealed enemy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmay have been to blame, but if you had been in my situation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndrew the key from his pocket, and advanced towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio with a serious and anxious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have been to blame\xe2\x80\x94forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, moving to depart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, holding him tremblingly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have been to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, freeing himself from his grasp,\r\nand immediately springing out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua! Perpetua!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio, after having in vain called\r\nback the fugitive. Perpetua did not answer. The poor man was so\r\noverwhelmed by his innumerable difficulties, his increasing\r\nperplexities, and so apprehensive of some fresh attack, that he\r\nconceived the idea of securing to himself a safe retreat from them all,\r\nby going to bed and giving out that he had a fever. His malady, indeed,\r\nwas not altogether imaginary; the terror of the past day, the anxious\r\nwatching of the night, the dread of the future, had combined to\r\nproduce really the effect. Weary and stupified, he slumbered in his\r\nlarge chair, muttering occasionally in a feeble but passionate voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Perpetua arrived at last with a great cabbage under her\r\narm, and with as unconcerned a countenance as if nothing had happened.\r\nWe will spare the reader the reproaches, the accusations, and denials\r\nthat passed between them; it is sufficient that Don Abbondio ordered\r\nPerpetua to bolt the door, not to put her foot outside, and if any one\r\nknocked, to reply from the window that the curate was gone to bed with a\r\nfever. He then slowly ascended the stairs and put himself really in bed,\r\nwhere we will leave him.\r\n\r\nRenzo, meanwhile, with hurried steps, and with a mind unsettled and\r\ndistracted as to the course he should pursue, approached his home. Those\r\nwho injure others are guilty, not only of the evils they commit, but\r\nalso of the effects produced by these evils on the characters of the\r\ninjured persons. Renzo was a quiet and peaceful youth, but now his\r\nnature appeared changed, and his thoughts dwelt only on deeds of\r\nviolence. He would have run to the house of Don Roderick to assault him\r\nthere; but he remembered that it was a fortress, furnished with bravoes\r\nwithin, and well guarded without; that only those known to be friends\r\nand servants could enter without the minutest scrutiny; and that not\r\neven a tradesman could be seen there without being examined from head to\r\nfoot; and he, above all, would be, alas! but too well known. He then\r\nimagined himself placed behind a hedge, with his arquebuss in his hand,\r\nwaiting till Roderick should pass by alone; rejoicing internally at the\r\nthought, he pictured to himself an approaching footstep; the villain\r\nappears, he takes aim, fires, and he falls; he exults a moment over his\r\ndying struggles, and then escapes for his life beyond the confines! And\r\nLucy? This name recalled his wiser and better thoughts: he remembered\r\nthe last instructions of his parents; he thought of God, the Holy\r\nVirgin, and the Saints; and he tremblingly rejoiced that he had been\r\nguilty of the deed only in imagination. But how many hopes, promises,\r\nand anticipations did the idea of Lucy suggest? And this day so ardently\r\ndesired! How announce to her the dreadful news? And then, what plan to\r\npursue? How make her his own in spite of the power of this wicked lord?\r\nAnd now a tormenting suspicion passed through his mind. Don Roderick\r\nmust have been instigated to this injury by a brutal passion for Lucy!\r\nAnd she! He could not for a moment endure the maddening thought that she\r\nhad given him the slightest encouragement. But was she not informed of\r\nhis designs? Could he have conceived his infamous purpose, and have\r\nadvanced so far towards its completion, without her knowledge? And Lucy,\r\nhis own beloved, had never uttered a syllable to him concerning it!\r\n\r\nThese reflections prevailing in his mind, he passed by his own house,\r\nwhich was situated in the centre of the village, and arrived at that of\r\nLucy, which was at the opposite extremity. It had a small court-yard in\r\nfront, which separated it from the road, and which was encircled by a\r\nlow wall. Entering the yard, Renzo heard a confused murmur of voices in\r\nthe upper chamber; he rightly supposed it to be the wedding company,\r\nand he could not resolve to appear before them with such a countenance.\r\nA little girl, who was standing at the door, ran towards him, crying\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cThe bridegroom! the bridegroom!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHush, Betsy, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome hither; go to Lucy, and whisper in her ear\xe2\x80\x94but let no one hear\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94whisper in her ear, that I wish to speak with her in the lower\r\nchamber, and that she must come at once.\xe2\x80\x9d The little girl hastily\r\nascended the stairs, proud of having a secret commission to execute.\r\nLucy had just come forth, adorned from the hands of her mother, and\r\nsurrounded by her admiring friends. These were playfully endeavouring to\r\nsteal a look at the blooming bride; while she, with the timidity of\r\nrustic modesty, attempted to conceal her blushing countenance with her\r\nbending arm, from beneath which a smiling mouth nevertheless appeared.\r\nHer black tresses, parted on her white forehead, were folded up in\r\nmultiplied circles on the back of her head, and fastened with pins of\r\nsilver, projecting on every side like the rays of the sun: this is still\r\nthe custom of the Milanese peasantry. Around her throat she had a\r\nnecklace of garnets, alternated with beads of gold filagree; she wore a\r\nboddice embroidered in flowers, the sleeves tied with ribands; a short\r\npetticoat of silk, with numerous minute plaits; crimson stockings, and\r\nembroidered silk slippers. But beyond all these ornaments was the modest\r\nand beautiful joy depicted on her countenance; a joy, however, troubled\r\nby a slight shade of anxiety. The little Betsy intruded herself into the\r\ncircle, managed to approach Lucy, and communicated her message. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nreturn in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy to her friends, as she hastily quitted\r\nthe room. On perceiving the altered and unquiet appearance of Renzo,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, not without a presentiment of evil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9call is at a stand, and God knows whether we\r\nshall ever be man and wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, alarmed. Renzo related briefly the history of the\r\nmorning; she listened with anguish: when he uttered the name of Don\r\nRoderick, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, blushing and trembling, \xe2\x80\x9chas it then come\r\nto this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not make me speak now, do not make me weep! I\xe2\x80\x99ll call my mother and\r\ndismiss the company. We must be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she departed, Renzo whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have never spoken of it to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Renzo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy, turning for a moment to gaze at him.\r\n\r\nHe understood well what this action meant; it was as if she had said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you doubt me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the good Agnes (so the mother of Lucy was called) had\r\ndescended the stairs, to ascertain the cause of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappearance. She remained with Renzo; while Lucy returned to the\r\ncompany, and, assuming all the composure she could, said to them, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nSignor Curate is indisposed, and the wedding cannot take place to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe ladies departed, and lost no time in relating amongst the gossips of\r\nthe neighbourhood all that had occurred, while they made particular\r\nenquiries respecting the reality of Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s sickness. The truth\r\nof this cut short the conjectures which they had already begun to\r\nintimate by brief and mysterious hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy entered the lower room as Renzo was sorrowfully informing Agnes of\r\nthat, to which she as sorrowfully listened. Both turned towards her from\r\nwhom they expected an explanation which could not but be painful; the\r\nsuspicions of both were, however, excited in the midst of their grief,\r\nand the displeasure they felt towards Lucy differed only according to\r\ntheir relative situation. Agnes, although anxious to hear her daughter\r\nspeak, could not avoid reproaching her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo say nothing to thy mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I will tell you all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, wiping her eyes with her apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d cried at once her mother and her lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it should come to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\na voice interrupted by tears, she related that a few days previously, as\r\nshe returned from weaving, and was loitering behind her companions, Don\r\nRoderick came up with her, in company with another gentleman; that the\r\nformer sought to engage her in idle conversation; that she quickened her\r\npace, without lending him an ear, and rejoined her companions; in the\r\nmean while she heard the other gentleman laugh, and Don Roderick say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lay a wager with you.\xe2\x80\x9d The day following, on their return, they\r\nmet them again, but Lucy kept in the midst of her companions, with her\r\nhead down; the other gentleman burst into laughter, and Don Roderick\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see, we will see.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHappily for me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lucy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis day was the last of the weaving. I related the adventure\r\nimmediately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom didst thou relate it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Agnes quickly, indignant at the\r\nidea of any one being preferred before her as a confidant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Father Christopher, in confession, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy, in a tone\r\nof apology. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him all, the last time you and I went to the church\r\nof the convent; you may perhaps recollect my contrivances for delay on\r\nthat morning, until there should pass some villagers in whose company we\r\nmight go into the street; because I was so afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe indignation of Agnes subsided at once, at the mention of a name so\r\nrevered as Father Christopher\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cThou didst well, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said she;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut why not tell it also to thy mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor this, Lucy had had two very good reasons; the one, a desire not to\r\ndisturb and frighten her mother with a circumstance she could not have\r\nprevented; the other, the dread of placing a secret, which she wished to\r\nbe buried in her own bosom in danger of becoming known to all the\r\nvillage: of these two reasons she only alleged the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd could I,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning to Renzo, in a gentle and reproachful\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9ccould I speak to you of this?\xe2\x80\x94Alas! that you should know it\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the Father say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to endeavour to hasten my nuptials, and in the mean while to\r\nkeep myself within doors; to pray much to God; and he hoped that if Don\r\nRoderick should not see me, he would cease to think of me. And it was\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, turning again towards Renzo, without, however,\r\nraising her eyes, and blushing deeply, \xe2\x80\x9cit was then that I compelled\r\nmyself, at the risk of appearing very forward, to request you to\r\nconclude the marriage before the appointed time. Who can tell what you\r\nmust have thought of me? But I did it for the best, and from advice\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis morning I little thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She could articulate no longer, and\r\nburst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the scoundrel! the villain!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Renzo, pacing the room in a\r\nviolent paroxysm of rage. He stopped suddenly before Lucy, regarded her\r\nwith a countenance agitated by various passions, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the\r\nlast wicked deed this wretch will perform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! no, Renzo, for the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cno, no, for the\r\nlove of Heaven! There is a God who watches over the oppressed; but do\r\nyou think he will protect us if we do evil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, for the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRenzo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a more resolved and tranquil air, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a\r\ntrade, and I know how to work: let us go away into some distant place,\r\nthat he may hear of us no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Lucy! but we are not yet man and wife! If we were married, then,\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy relapsed into tears, and all three remained silent; the\r\ndeep despondency of their countenances formed a mournful contrast to the\r\nfestive character of their dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, my children; listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, after a few moments;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came into the world before you, and I know it a little better than\r\nyou do. The devil is not so frightful as they paint him. To us poor\r\npeople the skeins appear more entangled, because we do not know where\r\nto look for the end; but sometimes advice from a learned man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nwhat I mean to say.\xe2\x80\x94Do as I tell you, Renzo; go to Lecco; find the\r\nDoctor _Azzecca Garbugli_[2]; relate to him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But you must not call him\r\nby this name\xe2\x80\x94it is a nick-name. Say to the doctor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94what do they call\r\nhim? Oh dear! I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of his real name, every one calls him\r\n_Azzecca Garbugli_. Well, well, find this tall, stiff, bald doctor, with\r\na red nose, and a face as red\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      [2] Seek quarrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the man by sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a man for you! I have seen\r\nmore than one troubled wretch who did not know which way to turn\r\nhimself; I have known him remain an hour with the Doctor _Azzecca\r\nGarbugli_ (be careful you don\xe2\x80\x99t call him so), and go away laughing at\r\nhimself for his uneasiness. Take with you these fowls; I expected to\r\nhave wrung their necks, poor little things! for the banquet of to-night;\r\nhowever, carry them to him, because one must never go empty-handed to\r\nthese gentlemen. Relate to him all that has happened, and he will tell\r\nyou at once that which would never enter our heads in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo and Lucy approved of this advice; Agnes, proud of having given it,\r\nwith great complacency took the poor fowls one by one from the coop,\r\ntied their legs together as if she were making a nosegay, and consigned\r\nthem to his hands. After having exchanged words of hope, he departed,\r\navoiding the high road and crossing the fields, so as not to attract\r\nnotice. As he went along, he had leisure to dwell on his misfortunes,\r\nand revolve in his mind his anticipated interview with the Doctor\r\n_Azzecca Garbugli_. I leave the reader to imagine the condition of the\r\nunfortunate fowls swinging by the legs with their heads downwards in the\r\nhands of a man agitated by all the tumults of passion; and whose arm\r\nmoved more in accordance with the violence of his feelings, than with\r\nsympathy for the unhappy animals whose heads became conscious of sundry\r\nterrific shocks, which they resented by pecking at one another,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npractice too frequent with companions in misfortune.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the village, asked for the house of the doctor, which\r\nbeing pointed out to him, he proceeded thither. On entering, he\r\nexperienced the timidity so common to the poor and illiterate at the\r\nnear approach to the learned and noble; he forgot all the speeches he\r\nhad prepared, but giving a glance at the fowls, he took courage. He\r\nentered the kitchen, and demanded of the maid servant, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he could\r\nspeak with the Signor Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d As if accustomed to similar gifts, she\r\nimmediately took the fowls out of his hand, although Renzo drew them\r\nback, wishing the doctor to know that it was he who brought them. The\r\ndoctor entered as the maid was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGive here, and pass into the\r\nstudy.\xe2\x80\x9d Renzo bowed low to him; he replied with a kind \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, my\r\nson,\xe2\x80\x9d and led the way into an adjoining chamber. This was a large room,\r\non the three walls of which were distributed portraits of the twelve\r\nC\xc3\xa6sars, while the fourth was covered with a large bookcase of old and\r\ndusty books; in the middle stood a table laden with memorials, libels,\r\nand proclamations, with three or four seats around; on one side of it\r\nwas a large arm-chair with a high and square back, terminated at each\r\ncorner by ornaments of wood in the fashion of horns; the nails which had\r\nfallen out here and there from its leathern covering, left the corners\r\nof it at liberty to roll themselves up in all directions. The doctor was\r\nin his morning gown, that is, enveloped in a faded toga, which had\r\nserved him long since to appear in at Milan, on some great occasion. He\r\nclosed the door, and encouraged the young man with these words: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\r\ntell me your case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to speak a word to you in confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, say on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, as he seated himself in the\r\narm-chair. Renzo stood before the table twirling his hat in his hand,\r\nand began, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know from one as learned as yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the affair just as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cin as few\r\nwords as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must pardon me, Signor Doctor; we poor people know not how to speak\r\nto such as you are. I wish then to know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the people! they are all alike; instead of relating facts, they\r\nask questions; and that because their own opinions are already settled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Signor Doctor. I wish, then, to know if there is a\r\npunishment for threatening a curate, to prevent him from performing a\r\nmarriage ceremony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, who in truth had _not_ understood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly assuming an air of seriousness and importance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA serious case, my son\xe2\x80\x94a case contemplated. You have done well to come\r\nto me; it is a clear case, noticed in a hundred proclamations, and in\r\none, of the year just elapsed, by the actual governor. You shall see,\r\nyou shall see! Where can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, plunging his hand amidst the\r\nchaos of papers; \xe2\x80\x9cit must surely be here, as it is a decree of great\r\nimportance. Ah! here it is, here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d He unfolded it, looked at the\r\ndate, and with a serious face exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cFifteenth of October, 1627.\r\nYes, yes, this is it; a new edict; these are those which cause\r\nterror\xe2\x80\x94Do you know how to read, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little, Signor Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, come behind me, and you will see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding the proclamation extended before him, he began to read,\r\nstammering rapidly over some passages, and pausing distinctly with great\r\nexpression on others, according to the necessity of the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Although by the proclamation published by order of the Signor Duke di\r\nFeria, on the 14th of December, 1620, and ratified by the most\r\nillustrious, and most excellent lord, Signor Gonsalez Fernandez de\r\nCordova,_ &c. &c.\xe2\x80\x94_had by extraordinary and rigorous remedies provided\r\nagainst the oppressions, exactions, and other tyrannical acts committed\r\nagainst the devoted vassals of His Majesty; the frequency of the\r\nexcesses, however,_ &c. &c., _has arrived at such a point that His\r\nExcellency is under the necessity,_ &c. &c.\xe2\x80\x94_wherefore, with the\r\nconcurrence of the Senate and Convention,_ &c. &c.\xe2\x80\x94_has resolved to\r\npublish the present decree.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from the tyrannical acts which the\r\nskill of many in the villages, as well as in the cities._\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nhear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94umph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_exact and oppress the weak in various ways, making\r\nviolent contracts of purchase, of rent,_ &c.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?

The doctor, perceiving his new client more\r\nattentive than dismayed, marvelled greatly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be enrolled as one\r\nof the bravoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, addressing\r\nRenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have shaved off the long lock! Well, well, it was prudent;\r\nbut placing yourself in my hands, you need not have done so. The case is\r\na serious one\xe2\x80\x94you can have no idea how much resolution is required to\r\nconduct these matters wisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo understand this mistake of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s, it should be known, that the\r\nbravoes by profession used to wear a long lock of hair, which they\r\npulled over the face as a mask in enterprises that required prudence as\r\nwell as strength. The proclamation had not been silent with regard to\r\nthis custom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_His Excellency commands, that whosoever shall wear hair of such a\r\nlength as to cover the forehead to the eyebrows, will incur the penalty\r\nof a fine of three hundred crowns; in case of incapability of payment,\r\nthree years in the galleys for the first offence; and for the second, in\r\naddition to the aforesaid, greater punishments still, at the will of His\r\nExcellency._\xe2\x80\x9d The long lock had become a distinctive mark of the loose\r\nand disorderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never worn a long lock in my\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, shaking his head, with a knowing\r\nand rather impatient smile, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing, if you do not trust me. He who\r\nutters falsehoods to the doctor is a fool who will tell the truth to the\r\njudge. It is necessary to relate things plainly to the lawyer, but it\r\nrests with us to render them more intricate. If you wish me to help you,\r\nyou must tell all from beginning to end, as to your confessor: you must\r\nname the person who commissioned you to do the deed; doubtless he is a\r\nperson of consequence; and, considering this, I will go to his house to\r\nperform an act of duty. I will not betray you at all, be assured; I will\r\ntell him I come to implore his protection for a poor calumniated youth;\r\nand we will together use the necessary means to finish the affair in a\r\nsatisfactory manner. You understand; in securing himself, he will\r\nlikewise secure you. If, however, the business has been all your own, I\r\nwill not withdraw my protection: I have extricated others from worse\r\ndifficulties; provided you have not offended a person of\r\n_consequence_;\xe2\x80\x94you understand\xe2\x80\x94I engage to free you from all\r\nembarrassment, with a little expense\xe2\x80\x94you understand. As to the curate,\r\nif he is a person of judgment, he will keep his own counsel; if he is a\r\nfool, we will take care of him. One may escape clear out of every\r\ntrouble; but for this, a _man_, a _man_ is necessary. Your case is a\r\nvery, very serious one\xe2\x80\x94the edict speaks plainly; and if the thing\r\nrested between you and the law, to be candid, it would go hard with you.\r\nIf you wish to pass smoothly\xe2\x80\x94money and obedience!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst the doctor poured forth this rhapsody, Renzo had been regarding\r\nhim with mute astonishment, as the countryman watches the juggler, whom\r\nhe sees cramming his mouth with handful after handful of tow; when, lo!\r\nhe beholds immediately drawn forth from the same mouth a never-ending\r\nline of riband. When at last he perceived his meaning, he interrupted\r\nhim with, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Signor Doctor, how you have misunderstood me! the matter\r\nis directly the reverse; I have threatened no one\xe2\x80\x94not I\xe2\x80\x94I never do\r\nsuch things; ask my companions, all of them, and they will tell you I\r\nnever had any thing to do with the law. The injury is mine, and I have\r\ncome to you to know how I can obtain justice, and am well satisfied to\r\nhave seen this proclamation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor, opening wide his eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a cock\r\nand a bull story you have made! So it is; you are all alike: is it\r\npossible you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell a plain fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Signor Doctor, you must pardon me, you have not given me time; now\r\nI will tell you all. Know, then, that I was to have been married\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and here his voice trembled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwas to have been married to-day\r\nto a young person to whom I have been some time betrothed; to-day was\r\nthe day fixed upon by the Signor Curate, and every thing was in\r\nreadiness. The Signor Curate began to make excuses\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94not to weary\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I compelled him to tell me the cause; and he confessed that he had\r\nbeen forbidden, on pain of death, to perform the ceremony. This powerful\r\nDon Roderick\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d hastily interrupted the doctor, contracting his brow and wrinkling\r\nhis red nose, \xe2\x80\x9caway with you; what have I to do with these idle stories?\r\nTell them to your companions, and not to one of my condition. Begone; do\r\nyou think I have nothing to do but listen to tales of this sort\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegone, I say; what have I to do with your protestations? I wash my\r\nhands from them!\xe2\x80\x9d and pacing the room, he rubbed his hands together, as\r\nif really performing that act. \xe2\x80\x9cHereafter learn when to speak; and do\r\nnot take a gentleman by surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hear me, hear me,\xe2\x80\x9d vainly repeated Renzo.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, still growling, pushed him towards the door, set it wide\r\nopen, called the maid, and said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cReturn this man immediately\r\nwhat he brought, I will have nothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman had never\r\nbefore been required to execute a similar order, but she did not\r\nhesitate to obey; she took the fowls and gave them to Renzo with a\r\ncompassionate look, as if she had said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly have made some\r\nvery great blunder.\xe2\x80\x9d Renzo wished to make apologies; but the doctor was\r\nimmovable. Confounded, therefore, and more enraged than ever, he took\r\nback the fowls and departed, to render an account of the ill success of\r\nhis expedition.\r\n\r\nAt his departure, Agnes and Lucy had exchanged their nuptial robes for\r\ntheir humble daily habits, and then, sorrowful and dejected, occupied\r\nthemselves in suggesting fresh projects. Agnes expected great results\r\nfrom Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the doctor; Lucy thought that it would be well to\r\nlet Father Christopher know what had happened, as he was a man who would\r\nnot only advise, but assist whenever he could serve the unfortunate;\r\nAgnes assented, but how was it to be accomplished? the convent was two\r\nmiles distant, and at this time _they_ certainly could neither of them\r\nhazard a walk thither. Whilst they were weighing the difficulties, some\r\none knocked at the door, and they heard a low but distinct _Deo\r\nGracias_. Lucy, imagining who it was, hastened to open it; and, bowing\r\nlow, there entered a capuchin collector of contributions, with his\r\nwallet swung over his left shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! brother Galdino!\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord be with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brother; \xe2\x80\x9cI come for your contribution\r\nof nuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, get the nuts for the fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes. Lucy obeyed; but before\r\nshe quitted the room, she gave her mother a kind and impressive look, as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cBe secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe capuchin, looking significantly at Agnes, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the wedding? It\r\nwas to have taken place to-day; what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curate is sick, and we are obliged to defer it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the dame,\r\nin haste; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what success in the contributions?\xe2\x80\x9d continued she,\r\nanxious to change the subject, which she would willingly have prolonged,\r\nbut for Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s earnest look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery poor, good dame, very poor. This is all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, swinging the\r\nwallet from his shoulder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis is all; and for this I have been obliged\r\nto knock at ten doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the year is a scarce one, brother Galdino, and when we have to\r\nstruggle for bread, our alms are necessarily small.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we wish abundance to return, my good dame, we must give alms. Do you\r\nnot know the miracle of the nuts, which happened many years ago in our\r\nconvent of Romagna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, in truth; tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell you must know, then, that in this convent there was one of our\r\nfathers who was a saint; he was called Father Macario. One winter\xe2\x80\x99s day,\r\npassing by a field of one of our patrons,\xe2\x80\x94a worthy man he was,\xe2\x80\x94he saw\r\nhim standing near a large nut tree, and four peasants with their axes\r\nraised to level it to the ground. \xe2\x80\x98What are you doing to the poor tree?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndemanded father Macario. \xe2\x80\x98Why, father, it is unfruitful, and I am about\r\nto cut it down.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do not do so, do not do so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father; \xe2\x80\x98I tell\r\nyou that next year it will bear more nuts than leaves.\xe2\x80\x99 The master\r\nordered the workmen to throw at once the earth on the roots which had\r\nbeen already bared; and, calling after the Father Macario, said, \xe2\x80\x98Father\r\nMacario, the half of the crop shall be for the convent.\xe2\x80\x99 The prediction\r\nwas noised about, and every one went to look at the tree. In fact, when\r\nspring arrived, there were flowers in abundance, and afterwards nuts in\r\nabundance! But there was a greater miracle yet, as you shall hear. The\r\nowner, who, before the nut season, was called hence to enjoy the fruits\r\nof his charity, left a son of a very different character from himself.\r\nNow, at the time of harvest, the collector went to receive his appointed\r\nportion; but the son affected entire ignorance, and presumptuously\r\nreplied, he never had understood that the capuchins knew how to make\r\nnuts. Now guess what happened then. One day he had invited to dinner\r\nsome friends, and, making merry, he amused them with the story of the\r\nnuts; they desired to visit his granary, to behold his abundance; he led\r\nthe way, advanced towards the corner where they had been placed,\r\nlooked\xe2\x80\x94and what do you think he saw?\xe2\x80\x94a heap of dry nut leaves! Was not\r\nthis a miracle? And the convent gained, instead of suffering loss; the\r\nprofusion of nuts bestowed upon it in consequence was so great, that one\r\nof our patrons, compassionating the poor collector, gave him a mule to\r\nassist in carrying them home. And so much oil was made, that it was\r\nfreely given to the poor; like the sea, which receives waters from every\r\npart, and distributes abundantly to the rivers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy now reappeared with her apron so loaded with nuts, that she could\r\nwith difficulty support the burthen. Whilst Friar Galdino untied his\r\nwallet to receive them, Agnes cast an astonished and displeased glance\r\nat her for her prodigality; she returned it with a look which seemed to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cI will satisfy you.\xe2\x80\x9d The friar was liberal of thanks, and,\r\nreplacing his wallet, was about to depart, when Lucy called him back. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you to do me a service,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to say to Father\r\nChristopher that I have a great desire to speak with him, and request\r\nhim to have the goodness to come hither immediately, as it is impossible\r\nfor me to go to the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly; an hour shall not elapse before Father Christopher shall be\r\ninformed of your wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rely on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will be faithful,\xe2\x80\x9d and moved off, bending under\r\nthe increased weight of his wallet. We must not suppose, from the\r\nreadiness with which Lucy sent this request to Father Christopher, and\r\nthe equal readiness of Father Galdino to carry it, that the father was a\r\nperson of no consequence; on the contrary, he was a man of much\r\nauthority amongst his companions, and throughout all the neighbourhood.\r\nTo serve the feeble, and to be served by the powerful; to enter the\r\npalace and the hut; to be at one time a subject of pastime, and at\r\nanother regarded with profound respect; to seek alms, and to bestow\r\nthem;\xe2\x80\x94to all these vicissitudes a capuchin was well accustomed. The\r\nname of _Friar_, at this period, was uttered with the greatest respect,\r\nand with the most bitter contempt; of both of which sentiments, perhaps,\r\nthe capuchins were, more than any other order, the objects. They\r\npossessed no property, wore a coarser habit than others, and made a more\r\nopen profession of humility; they therefore exposed themselves, in a\r\ngreater degree, to the veneration or the scorn which might result from\r\nthe various characters among men.\r\n\r\nThe Friar Galdino being gone, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a quantity of nuts!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nAgnes, \xe2\x80\x9cand in a year of scarcity!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nif we had been as penurious as others in our charity, who can tell how\r\nlong the friar would have been in reaching home, or, amongst all the\r\ngossipings, whether he would have remembered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true, it was a good thought; and besides, charity always produces\r\ngood fruit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, who, with all her defects, was a kind-hearted\r\nwoman, and would have sacrificed every thing she had in the world for\r\nthe sake of her child, in whom she had reposed all her happiness.\r\n\r\nRenzo entered at this moment, with an angry and mortified countenance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty advice you gave me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Agnes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou sent me to a fine\r\nman, indeed! to one truly who aids the distressed!\xe2\x80\x9d And he briefly\r\nrelated his interview with the doctor. The dame, astonished at the\r\nissue, endeavoured to prove that the advice was good, and that the\r\nfailure must have been owing to Renzo himself. Lucy interrupted the\r\ndebate, by informing him of her message to Father Christopher: he seized\r\nwith avidity the new hopes inspired by the expectation of assistance\r\nfrom so holy a man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if the father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not extricate\r\nus from our difficulties, I will do it myself by some means or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBoth mother and daughter implored him to be patient and prudent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cFather Christopher will certainly be here, and\r\nhe will no doubt suggest to us some plan of action which we ourselves\r\nwould not have thought of in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if not, I will obtain redress, or find\r\nanother to do it for me; for surely there must be justice to be had in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir mournful conversation might have continued much longer, but\r\napproaching night warned him to depart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy mournfully, to Renzo, who could hardly resolve\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, yet more sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome saint will watch over us,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cBe patient and prudent.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmother added some advice of the like nature. But the disappointed\r\nbridegroom, with a tempest in his heart, left them, repeating the\r\nstrange proposition\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, there\xe2\x80\x99s justice in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d So true is\r\nit that, under the influence of great misfortune, men no longer know\r\nwhat they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had not yet risen above the horizon, when Father Christopher\r\nleft the convent of Pescarenico, to go to the cottage where he was so\r\nanxiously expected. Pescarenico is a small hamlet on the left bank of\r\nthe Adda, or, rather, of the Lake, a few steps below the bridge; a group\r\nof houses, inhabited for the most part by fishermen, and adorned here\r\nand there with nets spread out to dry. The convent was situated (the\r\nbuilding still subsists) at a short distance from them, half way between\r\nLecco and Bergamo.\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear and serene. As the sun rose behind the mountain, its\r\nrays brightened the opposite summits, and thence rapidly spread\r\nthemselves over the declivities and valleys; a light autumn breeze\r\nplayed through the leaves of the mulberry trees, and brought them to the\r\nground. The vineyards were still brilliant with leaves of various hues;\r\nand the newly made nets appeared brown and distinct amid the fields of\r\nstubble, which were white and shining with the dew. The scene was\r\nbeautiful; but the misery of the inhabitants formed a sad contrast to\r\nit. At every moment you met pale and ragged beggars, some grown old in\r\nthe trade, others youthful, and induced to it from extreme necessity.\r\nThey passed quietly by Father Christopher, and although they had nothing\r\nto hope from him, since a capuchin never touches money, they bowed low\r\nin thanks for the alms they had received, or might hereafter receive at\r\nthe convent. The spectacle of the labourers scattered in the fields was\r\nstill more mournful; some were sowing thinly and sparingly their seed,\r\nas if hazarding that which was too precious; others put the spade into\r\nthe earth with difficulty, and wearily turned up the clods. The pale and\r\nsickly child was leading the meagre cattle to the pasture ground, and as\r\nhe went along plucked carefully the herbs found in his path, as food for\r\nhis family. This melancholy picture of human misery increased the\r\nsadness of Father Christopher, who, when he left the convent, had been\r\nfilled with presentiments of evil.\r\n\r\nBut why did he feel so much for Lucy? And why, at the first notice, did\r\nhe hasten to her with as much solicitude as if he had been sent for by\r\nthe Father Provincial. And who was this Father Christopher? We must\r\nendeavour to satisfy all these enquiries.\r\n\r\nFather Christopher, of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, was a man nearer sixty than fifty years of\r\nage. His head was shaven, with the exception of the band of hair allowed\r\nto grow round it like a crown, as was the custom of the capuchins; the\r\nexpression of his countenance was habitually that of deep humility,\r\nalthough occasionally there passed over it flashes of pride and\r\ninquietude, which were, however, succeeded by a deeper shade of\r\nself-reproach and lowliness. His long grey beard gave more character to\r\nthe shape of the upper part of his head, on which habitual abstinence\r\nhad stamped a strong expression of gravity. His sunken eyes were for the\r\nmost part bent to the earth, but brightened at times with unexpected\r\nvivacity, which he ever appeared to endeavour to repress. His name,\r\nbefore entering the convent, had been Ludovico; he was the son of a\r\nmerchant of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who, having accumulated great wealth, had renounced\r\ntrade in the latter part of his life, and having resolved to live like a\r\ngentleman, he studied every means to cause his former mode of life to\r\nbe forgotten by those around him. He could not, however, forget it\r\nhimself; the shop, the goods, the day-book, the yard measure, rose to\r\nhis memory, like the shade of Banquo to Macbeth, amidst the pomp of the\r\ntable and the smiles of his parasites; whose continual effort it was to\r\navoid any word which might appear to allude to the former condition of\r\nthe host. Ludovico was his only child: he caused him to be nobly\r\neducated, as far as the laws and customs permitted him to do so; and\r\ndied, bequeathing him a splendid fortune. Ludovico had contracted the\r\nhabits and feelings of a gentleman, and the flatterers who had\r\nsurrounded him from infancy had accustomed him to the greatest deference\r\nand respect. But he found the scene changed when he attempted to mingle\r\nwith the nobility of the city; and that in order to live in their\r\ncompany he must school himself to patience and submission, and bear with\r\ncontumely on every occasion. This agreed neither with his education nor\r\nhis disposition. He retired from them in disgust, but unwillingly,\r\nfeeling that such should naturally have been his companions; he then\r\nresolved to outdo them in pomp and magnificence, thereby increasing the\r\nenmity with which they had already regarded him. His open and violent\r\nnature soon engaged him in more serious contests: he sincerely abhorred\r\nthe extortions and injuries committed by those to whom he had opposed\r\nhimself; he therefore habitually took part with the weak against the\r\npowerful, so that by degrees he had constituted himself the defender of\r\nthe oppressed, and the vindicator of their wrongs. The office was\r\nonerous; and fruitful in evil thoughts, quarrels, and enmities against\r\nhimself. But, besides this external warfare, he perhaps suffered still\r\nmore from inward conflicts; for often, in order to compass his objects,\r\nhe was obliged to adopt measures of circumvention and violence, which\r\nhis conscience disapproved. He was under the painful necessity of\r\nkeeping in pay a band of ruffians for his own security, as well as to\r\naid him in his enterprises; and for these purposes he was necessarily\r\nobliged to select the boldest, that is, the vilest, and to live with\r\nvagabonds from a love of justice; so that, disgusted with the world and\r\nits conflicts, he had many times seriously thought of entering some\r\nmonastery, and retiring from it for ever. Such intentions were more\r\nstrongly entertained on the failure of some of his enterprises, or the\r\nperception of his own danger, or the annoyance of his vicious\r\nassociates, and would probably have still continued _intentions_, but\r\nfor one of the most serious and terrible events of his hazardous mode of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHe was walking one day through the streets of the city, accompanied by a\r\nformer shopman, who had been transformed by his father into a steward,\r\nfollowed by two bravoes. The name of the shopman was Christopher; he was\r\na man about fifty years of age, devoted to the master whom he had tended\r\nin infancy, and upon whose liberality he supported himself, his wife,\r\nand a large family of children. Ludovico saw a gentleman approaching at\r\na distance, with whom he had never spoken in his life, but whom he hated\r\nfor his arrogance and pride, which hatred the other cordially returned.\r\nHe had in his train four bravoes; he advanced with a haughty step, and\r\nan expression of insolence and disdain on his countenance. It was\r\nLudovico\xe2\x80\x99s right, being on the left side, to pass nearest the wall,\r\naccording to the custom of the day, and every one was tenacious of this\r\nprivilege. As they met they stopped face to face, like two figures on a\r\nbass relief, neither of them being disposed to yield to the other. The\r\ngentleman, eyeing Ludovico proudly and imperiously, said, with a\r\ncorresponding tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cPass on the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass there yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ludovico, \xe2\x80\x9cthe street is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith persons of your condition the street is always mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if your arrogance were a law to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendants of each stood still, with their hands on their daggers,\r\nprepared for battle. The passers-by retreated to a distance to watch the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass on, vile mechanic, or I will teach you the civility due to a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie; I am not vile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! Do you give me the lie? If you were a gentleman I would soon settle\r\nmatters with my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a coward also, or you would not hesitate to support by deeds\r\nthe insolence of your words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrow this rascal in the dirt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, turning to his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see who will dare to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ludovico, stepping back and\r\nlaying his hand on his sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRash man,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, unsheathing his own, \xe2\x80\x9cI will break this in\r\npieces when it shall have been stained with your base blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rushed violently on each other; the servants of both sprang to the\r\ndefence of their masters. The combat was unequal in numbers, and also\r\nunequal from Ludovico\xe2\x80\x99s desire to defend himself rather than to wound\r\nhis enemy; whilst the latter intended nothing less than murder. Ludovico\r\nwas warding off the dagger of one of the bravoes, after having received\r\na slight scratch on the cheek, when his enemy thrust at him from behind;\r\nChristopher, seeing his master\xe2\x80\x99s peril, went to his assistance; upon\r\nthis the anger of the enraged cavalier was turned against the shopman,\r\nand he thrust him through the heart with his sword. Ludovico, as if\r\nbeside himself at the sight, buried his weapon in the breast of the\r\nmurderer, who fell almost at the same instant with the poor Christopher!\r\nThe attendants of the gentleman, beholding him on the ground, took to\r\nflight; and Ludovico found himself alone, in the midst of a crowd, with\r\ntwo bodies lying at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened? One\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94he has been thrust through the body. Who\r\nis killed? A nobleman.\xe2\x80\x94Holy Virgin! what destruction! who seeks,\r\nfinds.\xe2\x80\x94A moment pays all.\xe2\x80\x94What a wound!\xe2\x80\x94It must have been a serious\r\naffair!\xe2\x80\x94And this unfortunate man!\xe2\x80\x94Mercy! what a spectacle!\xe2\x80\x94Save, save\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x94It will go hard with him also.\xe2\x80\x94See how he is wounded\xe2\x80\x94he is\r\ncovered with blood!\xe2\x80\x94Escape, poor man, escape; do not let yourself be\r\ntaken.\xe2\x80\x9d These words expressed the common suffrage, and with advice came\r\nalso assistance; the affair had taken place near a church of the\r\ncapuchins, an asylum impenetrable to the officers of justice. The\r\nmurderer, bleeding and stupified, was carried thither by the crowd; the\r\nbrotherhood received him from their hands with this recommendation, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis an honest man who has made a proud rascal cold; but he did it in his\r\nown defence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLudovico had never before shed blood, and although in these times murder\r\nwas a thing so common that all ceased to wonder at it, yet the\r\nimpression which he received from the recollection of the dying (dying\r\nthrough his instrumentality,) was new and indescribable; a revelation of\r\nfeelings hitherto unknown. The fall of his enemy, the alteration of\r\nthose features, passing in a moment from angry threatenings to the\r\nsolemn stillness of death; this was a spectacle which wrought an\r\ninstantaneous change in the soul of the murderer. Whilst they were\r\ncarrying him to the convent he had been insensible to what was passing;\r\nreturning to his senses, he found himself in a bed of the infirmary, in\r\nthe hands of a friar who was dressing his wounds. Another, whose\r\nparticular duty it was to administer comfort to the dying, had been\r\ncalled to the scene of combat. He returned in a short time, and\r\napproaching Ludovico\xe2\x80\x99s bed, said, \xe2\x80\x9cConsole yourself; he has died in\r\npeace, has forgiven you, and hoped for your forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words\r\nthe soul of Ludovico was filled with remorse and sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the\r\nother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other had expired before I arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the avenues and environs of the convent swarmed with\r\npeople; the officers of justice arrived, dispersed the crowd, and placed\r\nthemselves in ambush at a short distance from the gates, so that no one\r\ncould pass through them unobserved. A brother of the deceased and some\r\nof his family appeared in full armour with a large attendance of\r\nbravoes, and surrounded the place, watching with a threatening aspect\r\nthe bystanders, who did not dare say, he is safe, but they had it\r\nwritten on their faces.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Ludovico recalled his scattered thoughts, when he asked for\r\na father confessor, prayed him to seek out the widow of Christopher, to\r\nask forgiveness in his name for having been (however involuntarily) the\r\ncause of her affliction, and to assure her that he would take the care\r\nof her family on himself. Reflecting further on his own situation, his\r\ndetermination was made to become a friar. It seemed as if God himself\r\nhad willed it, by placing him in a convent at such a conjuncture. He\r\nimmediately sent for the superior of the monastery, and expressed to him\r\nhis intention. He replied to him, that he should be careful not to form\r\na resolution precipitately, but that, if he persisted, he would be\r\naccepted. Ludovico then sent for a notary, and made a donation of all\r\nhis estate to the widow and family of Christopher.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Ludovico happened opportunely for his hosts, who felt\r\nthemselves embarrassed concerning him. To send him from the monastery,\r\nand thus expose him to justice and the vengeance of his enemies, was not\r\nto be thought of a moment; it would be the same as a renunciation of\r\ntheir privileges, a discrediting of the convent amongst the people; and\r\nthey would draw upon themselves the animadversion of all the capuchins\r\nof the universe for this relinquishment of the rights of the order, this\r\ndefiance of the ecclesiastical authorities, who then considered\r\nthemselves the guardians of these rights. On the other hand, the family\r\nof the deceased, rich, and powerful in adherents, were determined on\r\nvengeance, and disposed to consider as enemies whoever should place\r\nobstacles to its accomplishment. History declares, not that they grieved\r\nmuch for the dead, or that a single tear was shed for him amongst his\r\nwhole race, but that they were urged on by scenting the blood of his\r\nopponent. But Ludovico, by assuming the habit of a capuchin, removed all\r\ndifficulties: to a certain degree he made atonement; imposed on himself\r\npenitence; confessed his fault; withdrew from the contest; he was, in\r\nshort, an enemy who laid down his arms. The relations of the deceased\r\ncould, if they pleased, believe and boast that he had become a friar\r\nthrough despair and dread of their revenge. And at all events, to reduce\r\na man to dispossess himself of his wealth, to shave his head, to walk\r\nbare-footed, to sleep on straw, and to live on alms, might appear a\r\npunishment competent to the offence.\r\n\r\nThe superior presented himself before the brother of the deceased with\r\nan air of humility; after a thousand protestations of respect for his\r\nillustrious house, and of desire to comply with its wishes as far as was\r\npracticable, he spoke of the repentance and resolution of Ludovico,\r\npolitely hoping that the family would grant their accordance; and then\r\ninsinuating, mildly and dexterously, that, agreeable or not agreeable,\r\nthe thing would take place. After some little vapouring, he agreed to it\r\non one condition; that the murderer of his brother should depart\r\nimmediately from the city. To this the capuchin assented, as if in\r\nobedience to the wishes of the family, although it had been already so\r\ndetermined. The affair was thus concluded to the satisfaction of the\r\nillustrious house, of the capuchin brotherhood, of the popular feeling,\r\nand, above all, of our generous penitent himself. Thus, at thirty years\r\nof age, Ludovico bade farewell to the world; and having, according to\r\ncustom, to change his name, he took one which would continually recall\r\nto him his crime,\xe2\x80\x94thus he became _Friar Christopher_!\r\n\r\nHardly was the ceremony of assuming the habit completed, when the\r\nsuperior informed him he must depart on the morrow to perform his\r\nnoviciate at \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, sixty miles\xe2\x80\x99 distance. The noviciate bowed\r\nsubmissively. \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I leave the scene of\r\nmy crime, to do all that rests with me now to repair the evil; permit me\r\nto go to the house of the brother of him whom I have murdered, to\r\nacknowledge my fault, and ask forgiveness; perhaps God will take away\r\nhis but too just resentment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared to the superior that such an act, besides being praiseworthy\r\nin itself, would serve still more to reconcile the family to the\r\nmonastery. He therefore bore the request himself to the brother of the\r\nmurdered man; a proposal so unexpected was received with a mixture of\r\nscorn and complacency. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him come to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and appointed\r\nthe hour. The superior returned to Father Christopher with the desired\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman reflected that the more solemn and public the apology was,\r\nthe more it would enhance his credit with the family and the world; he\r\nmade known in haste to the members of the family, that on the following\r\nday they should assemble at his house to receive a common satisfaction.\r\nAt mid-day the palace swarmed with nobility of either sex; there was a\r\nblending of veils, feathers, and jewels; a heavy motion of starched and\r\ncrisped bands; a confused entangling of embroidered trains. The\r\nantechambers, the courts, and the street, were crowded with servants,\r\npages, and bravoes.\r\n\r\nFather Christopher experienced a momentary agitation at beholding all\r\nthis preparation, but recovering himself, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well; the deed\r\nwas committed in public, the reparation should be public.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, with\r\nhis eyes bent to the earth, and the father, his companion, at his elbow,\r\nhe crossed the court, amidst a crowd who eyed him with unceremonious\r\ncuriosity; he entered, ascended the stairs, and passing through another\r\ncrowd of lords, who made way for him at his approach, he advanced\r\ntowards the master of the mansion, who stood in the middle of the room\r\nwaiting to receive him, with downcast looks, grasping with one hand the\r\nhilt of his sword, and with the other pressing the cape of his Spanish\r\ncloak on his breast. The countenance and deportment of Father\r\nChristopher made an immediate impression on the company; so that all\r\nwere convinced that he had not submitted to this humiliation from fear\r\nof man. He threw himself on his knees before him whom he had most\r\ninjured, crossed his hands on his breast, and bending his head,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the murderer of your brother! God knows, that to\r\nrestore him to life I would sacrifice my own; but as this cannot be, I\r\nsupplicate you to accept my useless and late apology, for the love of\r\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were fixed in breathless and mute attention on the novice, and\r\non the person to whom he addressed himself; there was heard through the\r\ncrowd a murmur of pity and respect; the angry scorn of the nobleman\r\nrelaxed at this appeal, and bending towards the kneeling supplicant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a troubled voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe offence\xe2\x80\x94the deed\r\ntruly\xe2\x80\x94but the habit you wear\xe2\x80\x94not only this\xe2\x80\x94but on your own\r\naccount\xe2\x80\x94rise, father!\xe2\x80\x94my brother\xe2\x80\x94I cannot deny it\xe2\x80\x94was a cavalier\xe2\x80\x94of\r\na hasty temper. Do not speak of it again. But, father, you must not\r\nremain in this posture.\xe2\x80\x9d And he took him by the arm to raise him. Father\r\nChristopher, standing with his eyes still bent to the ground, continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may, then, hope that you have granted me your pardon. And if I obtain\r\nit from you, from whom may I not expect it? Oh! if I could hear you\r\nutter the word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nobleman; \xe2\x80\x9cI pardon you with all my heart, and\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d turning to the company\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAll! all!\xe2\x80\x9d resounded at once through\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the father expanded with joy, under which, however,\r\nwas still visible an humble and profound compunction for the evil, which\r\nthe remission of men could not repair. The nobleman, entirely\r\nvanquished, threw his arms around his neck, and the kiss of peace was\r\ngiven and received.\r\n\r\nLoud exclamations of applause burst from the company; and all crowded\r\neagerly around the father. In the meanwhile the servants entered,\r\nbearing refreshments; the master of the mansion, again addressing Father\r\nChristopher, said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, afford me a proof of your friendship by\r\naccepting some of these trifles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch things are no longer for me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the father; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you will\r\nallow me a loaf of bread, as a memorial of your charity and your\r\nforgiveness, I shall be thankful.\xe2\x80\x9d The bread was brought, and with an\r\nair of humble gratitude he put it in his basket. He then took leave of\r\nthe company; disentangled himself with difficulty from the crowd in the\r\nantechambers, who would have kissed the hem of his garment, and pursued\r\nhis way to the gate of the city, whence he commenced his pedestrian\r\njourney towards the place of his noviciate.\r\n\r\nIt is not our design to write the history of his cloistral life; we will\r\nonly say, he executed faithfully the offices ordinarily assigned to him,\r\nof preaching, and of comforting the dying; but beyond these, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\noppressor\xe2\x80\x99s wrongs, the proud man\xe2\x80\x99s contumely,\xe2\x80\x9d aroused in him a spirit\r\nof resistance which humiliation and remorse had not been able entirely\r\nto extinguish. His countenance was habitually mild and humble, but\r\noccasionally there passed over it a shade of former impetuosity, which\r\nwas with difficulty restrained by the high and holy motives which now\r\npredominated in his soul. His tone of voice was gentle as his\r\ncountenance; but in the cause of justice and truth, his language assumed\r\na character of solemnity and emphasis singularly impressive. One who\r\nknew him well, and admired his virtues, could often perceive, by the\r\nsmothered utterance or the change of a single word, the inward conflict\r\nbetween the natural impetus and the resolved will, which latter never\r\nfailed to gain the mastery.\r\n\r\nIf one unknown to him in the situation of Lucy had implored his\r\nassistance, he would have granted it immediately; with how much more\r\nsolicitude, then, did he direct his steps to the cottage, knowing and\r\nadmiring her innocence, trembling for her danger, and experiencing a\r\nlively indignation at the persecution of which she had become the\r\nobject. Besides, he had advised her to remain quiet, and not make known\r\nthe conduct of her persecutor, and he felt or feared that his advice\r\nmight have been productive of bad consequences. His anxiety for her\r\nwelfare, and his inadequate means to secure it, called up many painful\r\nfeelings, which the good often experience.\r\n\r\nBut while we have been relating his history, he arrived at the dwelling;\r\nAgnes and her daughter advanced eagerly towards him, exclaiming in one\r\nbreath, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Father Christopher, you are welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Christopher perceived immediately, from the countenances of Lucy\r\nand her mother, that some evil had occurred. \xe2\x80\x9cIs all well with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he. Lucy replied by a flood of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cQuiet yourself, poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he; \xe2\x80\x9cand do you,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me what is the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d Whilst the good dame proceeded with the melancholy relation, he\r\nexperienced a variety of painful emotions. The story being done, he\r\nburied his face in his hands, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, blessed God! how\r\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He then turned to Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child! God has, indeed, visited\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not abandon us, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbandon you!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I dare ask the protection\r\nof Almighty God for myself, if I abandoned _you_! You, so\r\ndefenceless!\xe2\x80\x94you, whom he has confided to me! Take courage! He will\r\nassist you\xe2\x80\x94His eye beholds you\xe2\x80\x94He can even make use of a feeble\r\ninstrument like myself to confound a \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Let us think what can be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, he grasped his beard and chin with his hand, as if to\r\nconcentrate more completely the powers of his mind. But the more clearly\r\nhe perceived the pressing nature of the case, the more uncertain and\r\ndangerous appeared every mode of meeting it. To endeavour to make Don\r\nAbbondio sensible of a failure in duty? This appeared hopeless; fear was\r\nmore powerful with him than either shame or duty. To inform the cardinal\r\narchbishop, and invoke his authority? That would require time; and, in\r\nthe meanwhile, what was to be done? To resist Don Roderick? How?\r\nImpossible! The affair being one of a private nature, he would not be\r\nsustained by the brethren of his order: he would, perhaps, be raising a\r\nstorm against himself; and, what was worse, by a useless attempt render\r\nthe condition of Lucy more hopeless and deplorable. After many\r\nreflections he came to the conclusion to go to Don Roderick himself, and\r\nto endeavour by prayers and representations of the punishments of the\r\nwicked in another state, to win him from his infamous purpose. At least\r\nhe might at the interview discover something of his intentions, and\r\ndetermine his measures accordingly. At this moment Renzo, who, as the\r\nreader will readily imagine, could not long be absent at so interesting\r\na crisis, appeared at the door of the room; the father raised his head\r\nand bowed to him affectionately, and with a look of intense pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they told you, father?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired he, with a troubled voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my son; and on that account I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say of the villain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I say of _him_? I say to _you_, dear Renzo, that you must\r\nconfide in God, and He will not abandon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed words!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the youth: \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not one of those who\r\nwrong the poor. But the curate and this doctor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not torment yourself uselessly: I am but a poor friar; but I repeat\r\nto you that which I have already said to Lucy and her mother\xe2\x80\x94poor as I\r\nam, I will never abandon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are not like the friends of the world\xe2\x80\x94rascals\xe2\x80\x94when I was in\r\nprosperity, abundant in protestations; ready to shed their blood for me,\r\nto sustain me against the devil! Had I an enemy, they would soon put it\r\nout of his power to molest me! And now, to see them withdraw\r\nthemselves!\xe2\x80\x9d He was interrupted in his vituperations by the dark shade\r\nwhich passed over the countenance of his auditor; he perceived the\r\nblunder he had made, and attempting to remedy it, became perplexed and\r\nconfused. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say\xe2\x80\x94I did not at all intend\xe2\x80\x94that is, I meant to\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean to say? You have already begun to mar my undertaking.\r\nIt is well that thou art undeceived in time. What! thou didst seek\r\nfriends! and what friends! they could not have aided thee, had they been\r\nwilling. And thou didst not apply to the only friend who can and will\r\nprotect thee;\xe2\x80\x94dost thou not know that God is the friend of all who\r\ntrust in Him? dost thou not know that to spread the talons does little\r\ngood to the weak? and even if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d at these words he grasped forcibly\r\nRenzo\xe2\x80\x99s arm; his countenance, without losing his wonted authority,\r\ndisplayed an affecting remorse; his eyes were fixed on the ground; and\r\nhis voice became slow and sepulchral: \xe2\x80\x9cand even if that little should be\r\ngained, how terribly awful! Renzo, will you confide in me?\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nshould say in me! a worm of the dust! will you not confide in God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cHe only is the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise me, then, that you will not meet or provoke any one; that you\r\nwill suffer yourself to be guided by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\nLucy drew a long breath, as if relieved from a weight, and Agnes was\r\nloud in applauses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my children,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Father Christopher: \xe2\x80\x9cI will go myself\r\nto-day to speak to this man: if God touches his heart through my words,\r\nwell; if not, _He_ will provide some other remedy. In the mean time keep\r\nyourselves quiet and retired; this evening, or to-morrow at the latest,\r\nyou shall see me again.\xe2\x80\x9d Having said this, he departed amidst thanks and\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the convent in time to perform his daily duty in the\r\nchoir, dined, and then pursued his way towards the den of the wild beast\r\nhe had undertaken to tame.\r\n\r\nThe palace of Don Roderick stood by itself, on the summit of one of the\r\npromontories that skirt the coast; it was three or four miles distant\r\nfrom the village; at the foot of the promontory nearest the lake, there\r\nwas a cluster of decayed cottages inhabited by peasantry belonging to\r\nDon Roderick. This was the little capital of his little kingdom. As you\r\ncast a glance within their walls, you beheld suspended to them various\r\nkinds of arms, with spades, mattocks, and pouches of powder, blended\r\npromiscuously. The persons within appeared robust and strong, with a\r\ndaring and insulting expression of countenance, and wearing a long lock\r\nof hair on the head, which was covered with net-work. The aged, that had\r\nlost their teeth, seemed ready to show their gums at the slightest call:\r\nmasculine women, with sinewy arms, seemed disposed to use them with as\r\nmuch indifference as their tongues; the very children exhibited the same\r\ndaring recklessness as the parent stock. Friar Christopher passed\r\nthrough the hamlet, ascending a winding path which conducted him to the\r\nlittle esplanade in the front of the castle. The door was shut, which\r\nwas a sign that the chief was dining and did not wish to be disturbed.\r\nThe few windows that looked on the road were small and decayed by time;\r\nthey were, however, secured by large iron bars; and the lowest of them\r\nwere more than ten feet from the ground. A profound silence reigned\r\nwithin, and a traveller might have believed the mansion deserted, but\r\nfor the appearance of four animals, two alive and two dead, in front of\r\nthe castle. Two large vultures, with their wings expanded, were nailed\r\neach at the posts of the gate; and two bravoes, extended at full length\r\non the benches on either side, were keeping guard until their master\r\nshould have finished his repast. The father stopped, as if willing also\r\nto wait. \xe2\x80\x9cFather, father, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not make the\r\ncapuchins wait here; we are the friends of the convent; I have been\r\nwithin its walls when the air on the outside of them was not very\r\nwholesome for me; it was well the fathers did not refuse me admittance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo saying, he gave two strokes with the knocker: at the sound, the howls\r\nof mastiffs were heard from within; and in a few moments there appeared\r\nan aged domestic. On seeing the father, he bowed reverently, quieted the\r\nanimals with his voice, introduced the guest into a narrow court, and\r\nclosed the gate. Then escorting him into a saloon, and regarding him\r\nwith an astonished and respectful look, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs not this\xe2\x80\x94the Father\r\nChristopher of Pescarenico?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you see, good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be to do good,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, murmuring between his teeth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood can be done every where.\xe2\x80\x9d He then guided him through two or three\r\ndark halls, and led the way to the banqueting room: here was heard a\r\nconfused noise of plates, and knives and forks, and discordant voices.\r\nWhilst Father Christopher was urging the domestic to suffer him to\r\nremain in some other apartment until the dinner should be finished, the\r\ndoor opened. A certain Count Attilio, a cousin of the noble host, (of\r\nwhom we have already spoken, without giving his name,) was seated\r\nopposite: when he saw the bald head and habit of the father, and\r\nperceived his motion to withdraw, \xe2\x80\x9cHo! father,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nescape us; reverend father, forward, forward!\xe2\x80\x9d Don Roderick seconded\r\nsomewhat unwillingly this boisterous command, as he felt some\r\npresentiment of the object of his visit. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, father, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe. Seeing there was no retreating, Father Christopher advanced,\r\nsaluting the nobleman and his guests.\r\n\r\nAn honest man is generally fearless and undaunted in presence of the\r\nwicked; nevertheless, the father, with the testimony of a good\r\nconscience and a firm conviction of the justice of his cause, with a\r\nmixture of horror and compassion for Don Roderick, felt a degree of\r\nembarrassment in approaching him. He was seated at table, surrounded by\r\nguests; on his right was Count Attilio, his colleague in libertinism,\r\nwho had come from Milan to visit him. To the left was seated, with\r\nrespectful submissiveness, tempered, however, with conscious security,\r\nthe _podest\xc3\xa0_ of the place,\xe2\x80\x94he whose duty it was, according to the\r\nproclamation, to cause justice to be done to Renzo Tramaglino, and to\r\ninflict the allotted penalty on Don Roderick. Nearly opposite to the\r\n_podest\xc3\xa0_ sat our learned Doctor _Azzecca Garbugli_, with his black cap\r\nand his red nose; and over against him two obscure guests, of whom our\r\nstory says nothing beyond a general mention of their toad-eating\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive a seat to the father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick. A servant presented a\r\nchair, and the good father apologised for having come at so inopportune\r\nan hour. \xe2\x80\x9cI would speak with you alone on an affair of importance,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded he, in a low tone, to Don Roderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, father, it shall be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the meanwhile\r\nbring the father something to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Christopher would have refused, but Don Roderick, raising his\r\nvoice above the tumult of the table, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, by Bacchus, you shall\r\nnot do me this wrong; a capuchin shall never leave this house without\r\nhaving tasted my wine, nor an insolent creditor without having tasted\r\nthe wood of my forests.\xe2\x80\x9d These words produced a universal laugh, and\r\ninterrupted for a moment the question which was hotly agitated between\r\nthe guests. A servant brought the wine, of which Father Christopher\r\npartook, feeling the necessity of propitiating the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe authority of Tasso is against you, respected Signor _Podest\xc3\xa0_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed aloud the Count Attilio: \xe2\x80\x9cthis great man was well acquainted\r\nwith the laws of knighthood, and he makes the messenger of Argantes,\r\nbefore carrying the defiance of the Christian knights, ask permission\r\nfrom the pious Bouillon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied vociferously the _podest\xc3\xa0_, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is poetical\r\nlicence merely: an ambassador is in his nature inviolable, by the law of\r\nnations, _jure gentium_; and moreover, the ambassador, not having spoken\r\nin his own name, but merely presented the challenge in writing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when will you comprehend that this ambassador was a daring fool,\r\nwho did not know the first\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the good leave of our guests,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Don Roderick, who did\r\nnot wish the argument to proceed farther, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will refer it to the\r\nFather Christopher, and submit to his decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Attilio, amused at submitting a question of\r\nknighthood to a capuchin; whilst the _podest\xc3\xa0_ muttered between his\r\nteeth, \xe2\x80\x9cFolly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, from what I have comprehended,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a subject\r\nof which I have no knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual, modest excuses from the father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we\r\nwill not accept them. Come, come, we know well that you came not into\r\nthe world with a cowl on your head; you know something of its ways.\r\nWell, how stands the argument?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe facts are these,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Attilio\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell, who am neutral, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Don Roderick. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthe story: a Spanish knight sent a challenge to a Milanese knight; the\r\nbearer, not finding him at home, presented it to his brother, who,\r\nhaving read it, struck the bearer many blows. The question is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well done; he was perfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Count Attilio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no right about it,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the _podest\xc3\xa0_. \xe2\x80\x9cTo beat an\r\nambassador\xe2\x80\x94a man whose person is sacred! Father, do _you_ think this\r\nwas an action becoming a knight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; of a knight,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I know what belongs\r\nto a knight. Oh! if it had been an affair of fists, that would have\r\nbeen quite another thing, but a cudgel soils no one\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not speaking of this, Sir Count; I am speaking of the _laws_ of\r\nknighthood. But tell me, I pray you, if the messengers that the ancient\r\nRomans sent to bear defiance to other nations, asked permission to\r\ndeliver the message; find, if you can, a writer who relates that such\r\nmessenger was ever cudgelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have the ancient Romans to do with us? a people well enough in\r\nsome things, but in others, far, far behind. But according to the laws\r\nof modern knighthood, I maintain that a messenger, who dared place in\r\nthe hands of a knight a challenge without having previously asked\r\npermission, is a rash fool who deserves to be cudgelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut answer me this question\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hear me. To strike an unarmed person is an act of treachery.\r\n_Atqui_ the messenger _de quo_ was without arms. _Ergo_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, gently, Signor _Podest\xc3\xa0_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, I tell you; I concede that under other circumstances this might\r\nhave been called an act of treachery, but to strike a low fellow! It\r\nwould have been a fine thing truly, to say to him, as you would to a\r\ngentleman, Be on your guard! And you, Sir Doctor, instead of sitting\r\nthere grinning your approbation of my opinion, why do you not aid me to\r\nconvince this gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor in confusion; \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy this learned dispute, and\r\nam thankful for the opportunity of listening to a war of wit so\r\nagreeable. And moreover, I am not competent to give an opinion; his most\r\nillustrious lordship has appointed a judge\xe2\x80\x94the father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how can the judge speak when the\r\ndisputants will not keep silence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dumb,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Attilio. The _podest\xc3\xa0_ made a sign that he\r\nwould be quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! father! at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, with comic gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already said, that I do not comprehend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo excuses! we must have your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it must be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the father, \xe2\x80\x9cI should humbly think there was\r\nno necessity for challenges, nor bearers, nor blows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests looked in wonder at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Attilio. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, father; but\r\nthis is exceedingly ridiculous. It is plain you know nothing of the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9che knows as much of it as you do, cousin. Is\r\nit not so, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Christopher made no reply; but to himself he said, \xe2\x80\x9csubmit\r\nthyself to every insult for the sake of those for whom thou art here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94how is the father\r\ncalled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Christopher,\xe2\x80\x9d replied more than one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Father Christopher, your reverend worship, with your maxims you\r\nwould turn the world upside down\xe2\x80\x94without challenges! without blows!\r\nFarewell, the point of honour! Impunity to ruffians! Happily, the thing\r\nis impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Roderick, wishing to divert the dispute from\r\nthe original antagonists. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good man for an argument; what have\r\nyou to say to the father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, brandishing his fork in the air\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cindeed I\r\ncannot understand how the Father Christopher should not remember that\r\nhis judgment, though of just weight in the pulpit, is worth nothing\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nspeak with great submission\xe2\x80\x94on a question of knighthood. But perhaps he\r\nhas been merely jesting, to relieve himself from embarrassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father not replying to this, Don Roderick made an effort to change\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApropos,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand there is a report at Milan of an\r\naccommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was at this time a contest regarding the succession to the dukedom\r\nof Mantua, of which, at the death of Vincenzo Gonzaga, who died without\r\nmale issue, the Duke de Nevers, his nearest relation, had obtained\r\npossession. Louis XIII., or rather the Cardinal de Richelieu, wished to\r\nsustain him there; Philip IV., or rather the Count d\xe2\x80\x99Olivares, commonly\r\ncalled the Count Duke, opposed him. The dukedom was then a fief of the\r\nempire, and the two parties employed intrigue and importunity at the\r\ncourt of the Emperor Ferdinand II. The object of one was to obtain the\r\ninvestiture of the new duke; of the other, the denial of his claim, and\r\nalso assistance to oblige him to relinquish it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Attilio, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the thing will be\r\narranged satisfactorily. I have reasons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not believe it, count, do not believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d added the _podest\xc3\xa0_; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave an opportunity of knowing, because the Spanish keeper of the\r\ncastle, who is my friend, and who is the son of a dependant of the Count\r\nDuke, is informed of every thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I have discoursed on the subject daily at Milan; and I know\r\nfrom good authority that the pope, exceedingly interested as he is for\r\npeace, has made propositions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, the thing is in order; his Holiness does his duty; a pope\r\nshould always endeavour to make peace between Christian princes; but the\r\nCount Duke has his own policy, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, and, and, do you know, Signor _Podest\xc3\xa0_, how much thought the\r\nemperor now gives to it? Do you believe there is no place but Mantua in\r\nthe world! There are many things to provide for, signor, mind. Do you\r\nknow, for instance, how far the emperor can trust this Prince of\r\nValdistano, or di Vallistai, as they call him; and if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name, in the German language,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nWallenstein, as I have heard it uttered many times by the Spanish keeper\r\nof the castle. But be of good courage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you dare teach me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the count. Here Don Roderick whispered\r\nto him to cease contradiction, as there would be no end to it. He\r\nobeyed; and the _podest\xc3\xa0_, like a vessel unimpeded by shoals, continued\r\nwith full sails the course of his eloquence. \xe2\x80\x9cWallenstein gives me but\r\nlittle anxiety; because the Count Duke has his eye every where; and if\r\nWallenstein carries matters with a high hand, he will soon set him\r\nright. He has his eye every where, I say, and unlimited power; and if it\r\nis his policy that the Signor Duke of Nevers should not take root in\r\nMantua, he will never flourish there, be assured. It makes me laugh to\r\nsee the Signor Cardinal de Richelieu contend with an Olivares. The Count\r\nDuke, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he, with the wind still in his favour, and\r\nmuch wondering at not meeting with opposition, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Count Duke is an old\r\nfox\xe2\x80\x94speaking with due respect\xe2\x80\x94who would make any one lose his track:\r\nwhen he appears to go to the right, it would be safest to follow him to\r\nthe left: no one can boast of knowing his designs; they who are to\r\nexecute them, they who write the despatches, know nothing of them. I\r\nspeak from authority, for the keeper of the castle deigns to confide in\r\nme. The Count Duke knows well enough how the pot boils in all the courts\r\nin Europe; and these politicians have hardly laid a plan, but he begins\r\nto frustrate it. That poor man, the Cardinal Richelieu, attempts and\r\ndissembles, toils and strives; and what does it all produce? When he has\r\ndug the mine, he finds a countermine already prepared by the Count\r\nDuke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone can tell when the magistrate would have cast anchor, if Don\r\nRoderick had not interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cSignor _Podest\xc3\xa0_,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand you,\r\ngentlemen, a bumper to the Count Duke, and you shall then judge if the\r\nwine is worthy of the personage.\xe2\x80\x9d The _podest\xc3\xa0_ bowed low in gratitude\r\nfor an honour he considered as paid to himself in part for his eloquent\r\nharangue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Don Gaspero Guzman, Count de Olivares, Duke of St. Lucar, live a\r\nthousand years!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, raising his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay he live a thousand years!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed all the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp the father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not drink to the Count Duke? Would\r\nyou have us believe that you hold to the Navarre party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the contemptuous term applied to the French interest at the\r\ntime of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to be made to this, and the father was obliged to\r\ntaste the wine. All the guests were loud in its praise, except the\r\ndoctor, who had kept silence. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Roderick, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nthink _you_ of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, withdrawing his ruddy and shining nose\r\nfrom the glass, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is the Olivares of wines: there is not a\r\nliquor resembling it in all the twenty-two kingdoms of the king our\r\nmaster, whom God protect! I maintain that the dinners of the most\r\nillustrious Signor Don Roderick exceed the suppers of Heliogabalus, and\r\nthat scarcity is banished for ever from this palace, where reigns a\r\nperpetual and splendid abundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said! bravo! bravo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed with one voice the guests; but the\r\nword _scarcity_, which the doctor had accidentally uttered, suggested a\r\nnew and painful subject. All spoke at once:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no famine,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\none, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the speculators who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bakers, who conceal the grain. Hang them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right; hang them, without mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon fair trial,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat trial?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Attilio, more loudly; \xe2\x80\x9csummary justice, I say. Take\r\na few of them who are known to be the richest and most avaricious, and\r\nhang them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, hang them! hang them! and there will be grain scattered in\r\nabundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the party continued absorbing the wine, whose praises, mixed with\r\nsentences of economical jurisprudence, formed the burthen of the\r\nconversation; so that the loudest and most frequent words were, _Nectar,\r\nand hang \xe2\x80\x99em_.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick had, from time to time, during this confusion, looked at\r\nthe father: perceiving him calmly, but firmly, awaiting his leisure for\r\nthe interview which had been promised him, he relinquished the hope of\r\nwearying him by its postponement. To send away a capuchin, without\r\ngiving him an audience, was not according to his policy; and since it\r\ncould not be avoided, he resolved to meet it at once: he rose from the\r\ntable, excused himself to his guests, and saying proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cAt your\r\nservice, father,\xe2\x80\x9d led the way to another room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what can I serve you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, as soon as they entered\r\ninto the room. Such were his words, but his manner said plainly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember before whom thou standest, weigh well thy words, and be\r\nexpeditious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were no means more certain to impart courage to Father Christopher\r\nthan arrogance or pride. He had stood for a moment in some\r\nembarrassment, passing through his fingers the beads of the rosary that\r\nhung suspended from his girdle; but he soon \xe2\x80\x9cresumed new courage, and\r\nrevived,\xe2\x80\x9d at the haughty air of Don Roderick. He had, however,\r\nsufficient command over himself to reply with caution and humility. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncome to supplicate you to perform an act of justice: some wicked persons\r\nhave, in the name of your lordship, frightened a poor curate, and have\r\nendeavoured to prevent his fulfilling his duty towards an innocent and\r\nunoffending couple. You can by a word confound their machinations, and\r\nimpart consolation to the afflicted. You can\xe2\x80\x94and having it in your\r\npower\xe2\x80\x94conscience, honour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to me of conscience, when I ask your advice on the subject; and\r\nas to my honour, know that I only am the guardian of it, and that\r\nwhoever dares to meddle with it is a rash man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriar Christopher, warned by these words that the intention of Don\r\nRoderick was to turn the conversation into a dispute, so as to win him\r\nfrom his original purpose, determined to bear whatever insult might be\r\noffered him, and meekly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was certainly not my intention to\r\nsay any thing to displease you: correct me, reprove me; but deign to\r\nlisten to me. By the love of Heaven, by that God before whom we must all\r\nappear, I charge thee, do not obstinately refuse to do justice to the\r\ninnocent and oppressed! Think that God watches over them, that their\r\nimprecations are heard above, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Don Roderick, rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cThe respect I bear to your\r\nhabit is great; but if any thing could make me forget it, it would be to\r\nsee it worn by one coming as a spy into my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words spread an indignant glow over the face of the father; but\r\nswallowing them as a bitter medicine, he resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not believe\r\nthat I am such; you feel in your heart that I am here on no vile or\r\ncontemptible errand. Listen to me, Signor Don Roderick; and Heaven grant\r\nthat the day may never arrive, when you shall repent of not having\r\nlistened to me! Listen to me, and perform this deed of justice and\r\nbenevolence. Men will esteem you! God will esteem you! you have much in\r\nyour power, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d again interrupted Don Roderick with warmth, but with\r\nsomething like remorse, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when the whim takes me to hear a sermon, I\r\ncan go to church? But, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, with a forced smile of\r\nmockery, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are putting regal dignity on me, and giving me a preacher\r\nin my own palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to God princes are responsible for the reception of his messages;\r\nto God you are responsible; he now sends into your palace a message by\r\none of his ministers, the most unworthy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, preparing to go, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\ncomprehend you: I suppose you have some affair of your own on hand; make\r\na confidant of whom you please; but use not the freedom of troubling a\r\ngentleman any farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon Roderick, do not say _No_ to me; do not keep in anguish the heart\r\nof an innocent child! a word from you would be sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, \xe2\x80\x9csince you think I have so much in my power,\r\nand since you are so much interested\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Christopher, anxiously regarding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, advise her to come, and place herself under my protection; she\r\nwill want for nothing, and no one shall disturb her, as I am a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt such a proposal, the indignation of the friar, which had hitherto\r\nbeen restrained with difficulty, loudly burst forth. All his prudence\r\nand patience forsook him: \xe2\x80\x9cYour protection!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, stepping\r\nback, and stretching forth both his hands towards Don Roderick, while he\r\nsternly fixed his eyes upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cyour protection! You have filled the\r\nmeasure of your guilt by this wicked proposal, and I fear you no\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare you speak thus to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare; I fear you no longer; God has abandoned you, and you are no\r\nlonger an object of fear! Your protection! this innocent child is under\r\nthe protection of God; you have, by your infamous offer, increased my\r\nassurance of her safety. Lucy, I say; see with what boldness I pronounce\r\nher name before you; Lucy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! in this house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI compassionate this house; the wrath of God is upon it! You have acted\r\nin open defiance of the great God of heaven and earth; you have set at\r\nnaught his counsel; you have oppressed the innocent; you have trampled\r\non the rights of those whom you should have been the first to protect\r\nand defend. The wrath of God is upon you! A day will come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillain!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, who at first was confounded between rage\r\nand astonishment; but when he heard the father thundering forth this\r\nprediction, a mysterious and unaccountable dread took possession of his\r\nsoul. Hastily seizing his outstretched arm, and raising his voice in\r\norder to drown the maledictions of the monk, he cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cDepart\r\nfrom me, rash villain, cowled spy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words instantly cooled the glowing enthusiasm of Father\r\nChristopher. The ideas of insult and injury in his mind had long been\r\nhabitually associated with those of suffering and silence. His usual\r\nhabits resumed their sway, and he became calm; he awaited what farther\r\nmight be said, as, after the strength of the whirlwind has passed, an\r\naged tree naturally recomposes its branches, and receives the hail as\r\nHeaven sends it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillain! scoundrel! talk to your equals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut thank\r\nthe habit you bear for saving you from the chastisement which is your\r\ndue. Begone this instant, and with unscathed limbs, or we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo saying, he pointed imperiously to an opposite door. The friar bowed\r\nhis head, and departed, leaving Don Roderick to measure with hasty and\r\nagitated steps the field of battle.\r\n\r\nWhen he had closed the door behind him, the father perceived a man\r\nstealing softly away through another, and he recognised him as the aged\r\ndomestic who had been his guide to the presence of Don Roderick. Before\r\nthe birth of that nobleman, he had been in the service of his father,\r\nwho was a man of a very different character. At his death, the new\r\nmaster expelled all the domestics, with the exception of this one, whom\r\nhe retained on account of two valuable qualifications; a high conception\r\nof the dignity of the house, and a minute knowledge of the ceremonial\r\nrequired to support that dignity. The poor old man had never dared even\r\nto hint disapprobation of the daily proceedings at the castle before the\r\nsignor, but he would sometimes venture to allow an exclamation of grief\r\nand disapproval to escape him before his fellow servants, who were\r\ninfinitely diverted by his simple honesty, and his warm love of the good\r\nold times. His censures did not reach his master\xe2\x80\x99s ears unaccompanied by\r\na relation of the raillery bestowed upon them, so that he became an\r\nobject of general ridicule. On the days of formal entertainment,\r\ntherefore, the old man was a person of great importance.\r\n\r\nFather Christopher bowed to him as he passed by him, and pursued his\r\nway; but the old man approached him with a mysterious air, and made a\r\nsign that he should follow him into a dark passage, where, speaking in\r\nan under tone, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather! I have heard all, and I want to speak\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak at once, then, good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! oh no! Woe be to us if the master suspect it! But I shall be able\r\nto discover much, and I will endeavour to come to-morrow to the\r\nconvent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any base plot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something hatching, certainly; I have long suspected it; but\r\nnow I shall be on the look out, and I will come at the truth. These are\r\nstrange doings\xe2\x80\x94I live in a house where\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But I wish to save my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, placing his hands on his head, as he\r\nbent reverently towards him; \xe2\x80\x9cGod reward you! Do not forget then to come\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the domestic; \xe2\x80\x9cbut go, now, for the love of\r\nHeaven, and do not betray me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he looked cautiously on all sides, and led the way through\r\nthe passage into a large hall, which fronted the court-yard, and\r\npointing to the door, silently bade him \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen once in the street, and freed from this den of depravity, the\r\nfather breathed more freely; he hastened down the hill, pale in\r\ncountenance, and agitated and distressed by the scene he had witnessed,\r\nand in which he had taken so leading a part. But the unlooked-for\r\nproffer of the servant came like a cordial. It seemed as if Heaven had\r\nsent a visible sign of its protection\xe2\x80\x94a clue to guide him in his\r\nintricate undertaking\xe2\x80\x94and in the very house where it was least likely\r\nto be found. Occupied with these thoughts, he raised his eyes towards\r\nthe west, and beheld the sun declining behind the mountain, and felt\r\nthat he had but a few minutes in which to reach the monastery, without\r\nviolating the absolute law of the capuchins, that none of the\r\nbrotherhood should remain beyond the walls after sunset.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the cottage of Lucy there had been plans agitated of which\r\nit is necessary to inform the reader. After the departure of the father,\r\nthey had continued some time in silence; Lucy, with a heavy heart,\r\nprepared the dinner; Renzo, wavering and anxious, knew not how to\r\ndepart; Agnes was apparently absorbed with her reel, but she was really\r\nmaturing a thought, which she in a few moments thus declared:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my children. If you will have the necessary courage and\r\ndexterity; if you will confide in your mother; I pledge myself to free\r\nyou from perplexity, sooner than Father Christopher could do, although\r\nhe is the best man in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy looked at her mother with an\r\nexpression of astonishment rather than confidence, in a promise so\r\nmagnificent. \xe2\x80\x9cCourage! dexterity!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9csay, say, what can I\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you were married, your chief\r\ndifficulty would be removed, and that for the rest we would easily find\r\na remedy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cif we were married\xe2\x80\x94The world is before us;\r\nand at a short distance from this, in Bergamo, a silk weaver is received\r\nwith open arms. You know how often my cousin Bartolo has solicited me to\r\ngo there, and enter into business with him; how many times he has told\r\nme that I should make a fortune, as he has done; and if I never listened\r\nto his request, it was\xe2\x80\x94because my heart was here. Once married, we\r\nwould all go together, and live happily far from the clutches of this\r\nvillain, far from the temptation to do a rash deed. Is it not so, Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9ccourage and dexterity, and the thing is\r\neasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed they, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are prudent. Hear me patiently, and I\r\nwill endeavour to make you comprehend my project. I have heard it said\r\nby persons who knew, and moreover I have seen one instance of it myself,\r\nthat a curate\xe2\x80\x99s _consent_ is not necessary to render a marriage ceremony\r\nlawful, provided you have his presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear. There must be two witnesses, nimble and cunning. You go\r\nto the curate; the point is to catch him unexpectedly, that he may have\r\nno time to escape. You say, \xe2\x80\x98Signor Curate, this is my wife;\xe2\x80\x99 Lucy says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Signor Curate, this is my husband;\xe2\x80\x99 you must speak so distinctly that\r\nthe curate and the witnesses hear you, and the marriage is as inviolable\r\nas if the pope himself had celebrated it. When the words are once\r\nuttered, the curate may fret, and fume, and scold; it will be of no use,\r\nyou are man and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the thirty years I was in the world\r\nbefore you, I learned nothing? The thing is as I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was truly such as Agnes represented it; marriages contracted\r\nin this manner were at that time held valid. Such an expedient was,\r\nhowever, not recurred to, but in cases of great necessity, and the\r\npriests made use of every precaution to avoid this compulsive\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be true, Lucy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, regarding her attentively, with a\r\nsupplicating expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_If_ it be true!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Agnes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I would say that which\r\nis _not_ true? Well, well, get out of the difficulty as you can, I wash\r\nmy hands from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no! do not abandon us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean not to suggest a doubt\r\nof it. I place myself in your hands; I look to you as to a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe momentary anger of Agnes vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, in her usual modest tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did not\r\nFather Christopher think of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink you that it did not come into his mind?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\nwould not speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed they, both at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x94because, if you must know it, the friars do not approve of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must not do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I would advise you to do that which is\r\nnot right? If, against the advice of your parents, you were going to\r\nmarry a rogue\xe2\x80\x94but, on the contrary, I am rejoiced at your choice, and\r\nhe who _causes_ the disturbance is the only villain; and the curate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as clear as the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary to speak of it to Father Christopher,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nAgnes. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce over, what do you think he will say to you? \xe2\x80\x98Ah! daughter,\r\nit was a great error; but it is done.\xe2\x80\x99 The friars must talk thus; but,\r\nbelieve me, in his heart he will be well content.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy made no reply to an argument which did not appear to her very\r\npowerful; but Renzo, quite encouraged, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it be thus, the thing\r\nis done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is need of caution. We must procure the\r\nwitnesses; and find means to present ourselves to the curate\r\nunexpectedly. He has been two days concealed in his house; we must make\r\nhim remain there. If he suspects your intention, he will be as cunning\r\nas a cat, and flee as Satan from holy water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy here gained courage to offer her doubts of the propriety of such a\r\ncourse. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil now we have lived with candour and sincerity,\xe2\x80\x9d said she;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet us continue to do so; let us have faith in God, and God will aid\r\nus. Father Christopher said so: let us listen to his advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe guided by those who know better than you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need of advice? God tells us, \xe2\x80\x98Help thyself, and I will help\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99 We will tell the father all about it, when it is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you fail me now? Have we not done all that we\r\ncould do, like good Christians? Had not the curate himself fixed the day\r\nand the hour? And whose is the blame if we are now obliged to use a\r\nlittle management? No, you will not fail me. I go at once to seek the\r\nwitnesses, and will return to tell you my success.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he\r\nhastily departed.\r\n\r\nDisappointment sharpens the wit; and Renzo, who, in the straightforward\r\npath he had hitherto travelled, had not been required to subtilise much,\r\nnow conceived a plan which would have done honour to a lawyer. He went\r\ndirectly to the house of one Anthony, and found him in his kitchen,\r\nemployed in stirring a _polenta_ of wheat, which was on the fire, whilst\r\nhis mother, brother, and his wife, with three or four small children,\r\nwere seated at the table, eagerly intent on the earthen pan, and\r\nawaiting the moment when it should be ready for their attack. But, on\r\nthis occasion, the pleasure was wanting which the sight of dinner\r\nusually produces in the aspect of the labourer who has earned it by his\r\nindustry. The size of the _polenta_ was proportioned to the scantiness\r\nof the times, and not to the number and appetite of the assailants: and\r\nin casting a dissatisfied look on the common meal, each seemed to be\r\nconsidering the extent of appetite likely to survive it. Whilst Renzo\r\nwas exchanging salutations with the family, Tony poured out the pudding\r\non the pewter trencher prepared for its reception, and it appeared like\r\na little moon within a large circumference of vapour. Nevertheless, the\r\nwife of Tony said courteously to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you be helped to\r\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d This was a compliment that the peasants of Lombardy, however\r\npoor, paid to those who were, from any accident, present at their meals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cI only came to say a few words to Tony;\r\nand, Tony, not to disturb your family, we can go and dine at the inn,\r\nand we shall then have an opportunity to converse.\xe2\x80\x9d The proposal was as\r\nagreeable as it was unexpected. Tony readily assented to it, and\r\ndeparted with Renzo, leaving to his family his portion of the _polenta_.\r\nThey arrived at the inn, seated themselves at their ease in a perfect\r\nsolitude, since the penury of the times had driven away the daily\r\nfrequenters of the place. After having eaten, and emptied a bottle of\r\nwine, Renzo, with an air of mystery, said to Tony, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will do me a\r\nsmall service, I will do you a _great_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, speak, command me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony, filling his glass; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\r\nthrough fire to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are twenty-five livres in debt to the curate, for the rent of his\r\nfield, that you worked last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Renzo, Renzo! why do you mention it to me now? You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoiled your\r\nkindness, and put to flight my good wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I speak to you of your debt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because I intend to\r\ngive you the means of paying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally; would this content you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent me! that it would, indeed; if it were only to be freed from\r\nthose infernal shakings of the head the curate makes me every time I\r\nmeet him. And then always, \xe2\x80\x98_Tony, remember; Tony, when shall we see\r\neach other for this business?_\xe2\x80\x99 When he preaches, he fixes his eyes on\r\nme in such a manner, I am almost afraid he will speak to me from the\r\npulpit. I have wished the twenty-five livres to the devil a thousand\r\ntimes: and I was obliged to pawn my wife\xe2\x80\x99s gold necklace, which might be\r\nturned into so much _polenta_. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, if you will do me a small favour, the twenty-five livres are\r\nready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be silent and talk to no one about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeed you tell me that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curate has some foolish reason for putting off my marriage, and I\r\nwish to hasten it. I am told that the parties going before him with two\r\nwitnesses, and the one saying, _This is my wife_, and the other, _This\r\nis my husband_, that the marriage is lawful. Do you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish me to go as a witness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will pay the twenty-five livres?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone; I agree to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must find another witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found him already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony. \xe2\x80\x9cMy simpleton of a brother,\r\nJervase, will do whatever I tell him; but you will pay him with\r\nsomething to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cBut will he be able?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach him; you know I was born with brains for both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if thy wife should ask thee, as without doubt she will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in debt to my wife for lies already; and for so much, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow if we shall ever balance the account. I will tell her some idle\r\nstory or other to set her heart at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d With this good resolution he\r\ndeparted, leaving Renzo to pursue his way back to the cottage. In the\r\nmeanwhile Agnes had in vain solicited Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s consent to the measure; she\r\ncould not resolve to act without the approbation of Father Christopher.\r\nRenzo arrived, and triumphantly related his success. Lucy shook her\r\nhead, but the two enthusiasts minded her not. They were now determined\r\nto pursue their plan, and by authority and entreaties induce her finally\r\nto accede to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cit is well, but you have not thought of every\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I not thought of?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua! You have not thought of Perpetua. Do you believe that she\r\nwould suffer Tony and his brother to enter? How then is it probable she\r\nwould admit you and Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, pausing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you. I will go with you; I have a secret to tell her, which\r\nwill engage her so that she will not see you. I will take her aside, and\r\nwill touch such a chord\xe2\x80\x94you shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI have always said you were our best\r\nsupport.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all this will do no good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cif we cannot persuade Lucy,\r\nwho obstinately persists that it is sinful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo made use of all his eloquence, but Lucy was not to be moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow not what to say to your arguments,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that\r\nto do this, we shall degrade ourselves so far as to lie and deceive. Ah!\r\nRenzo, let us not so abase ourselves! I would be your wife\xe2\x80\x9d (and a blush\r\ndiffused itself over her lovely countenance), \xe2\x80\x9cI would be your wife, but\r\nin the fear of God\xe2\x80\x94at the altar. Let us trust in Him who is able to\r\nprovide. Do you not think He will find a way to help us, far better than\r\nall this deception? And why make a mystery of it to Father Christopher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contest still continued, when a trampling of sandals announced\r\nFather Christopher. Agnes had barely time to whisper in the ear of Lucy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful to tell him nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d when the friar entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace be with you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar as he entered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing\r\nmore to hope from man: so much the greater must be our confidence in\r\nGod; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve already had a pledge of his protection.\xe2\x80\x9d None of the three\r\nentertained much hope from the visit of Father Christopher: for it would\r\nhave been not only an unusual, but an absolutely unheard-of fact, for a\r\nnobleman to desist from his criminal designs at the mere prayer of his\r\ndefenceless victim. Still, the sad certainty was a painful stroke.\r\n\r\nThe women bent down their heads; but in the mind of Renzo anger\r\nprevailed over disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cI would know,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, gnashing his\r\nteeth, and raising his voice as he had never done before in the presence\r\nof Father Christopher, \xe2\x80\x9cI would know what reasons this dog has given,\r\nthat my wife should not _be_ my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Renzo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, with an accent of pity, and with a look\r\nwhich greatly enforced moderation; \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Renzo! if those who commit\r\ninjustice were always obliged to give a reason for it, things would not\r\nbe as they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has said, then, the dog! that he will not, because he will not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not even said _so_, poor Renzo! There would be something gained,\r\nif he would make an open confession of his iniquity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has said something; _what_ has this firebrand of hell said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not repeat his words. He flew into a passion at me for my\r\nsuspicions, and at the same time confirmed me in them: he insulted me,\r\nand then called himself offended; threatened, and complained. Ask no\r\nfarther. He did not utter the name of Lucy, nor even pretend to know\r\nyou: he affected to intend nothing. In short, I heard enough to feel\r\nthat he is inexorable. But confidence in God! Poor children! be patient,\r\nbe submissive! And thou, Renzo! believe that I sympathise with all that\r\npasses in thy heart.\xe2\x80\x94But _patience_! It is a poor word, a bitter word\r\nto those who want faith; but, Renzo, will you not let God work? Will you\r\nnot trust Him? Let Him work, Renzo; and, for your consolation, know that\r\nI hold in my hand a clue, by which I hope to extricate you from your\r\ndistress. I cannot say more now. To-morrow I shall not be here; I shall\r\nbe all day at the convent employed for you. Renzo, if thou canst, come\r\nthere to me; but, if prevented by any accident, send some trusty\r\nmessenger, by whom I can make known to you the success of my endeavours.\r\nNight approaches; I must return to the convent. Farewell! Faith and\r\ncourage!\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he departed, and hastened by the most abrupt but\r\nshortest road, to reach the convent in time, and escape the usual\r\nreprimand; or, what was worse, the imposition of some penance, which\r\nmight disenable him, for the following day, from continuing his efforts\r\nin favour of his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear him speak of a clue which he holds to aid us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is best to trust in him; he is a man who does not make rash\r\npromises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have spoken more clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cor at least have\r\ntaken me aside, and told me what it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put an end to the business; I\xe2\x80\x99ll put an end to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo,\r\npacing furiously up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Renzo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean? I mean to say that he may have a hundred thousand\r\ndevils in his soul, but he is flesh and blood notwithstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, for the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, but tears choked her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a theme for jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor jesting?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, stopping before her, with his countenance\r\ninflamed by anger; \xe2\x80\x9cfor jesting! you will see if I am in jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Renzo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen you thus before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak not in this manner. Do you not fear\r\nthe law, which is always to be had against the poor? And, besides, how\r\nmany arms would be raised at a word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cthe villain is well protected, dog that\r\nhe is! but no matter. Patience and resolution! and the time will come.\r\nYes! justice shall be done! I will free the country! People will bless\r\nme! Yes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horror which Lucy felt at this explicit declaration of his purpose\r\ninspired her with new resolution. With a tearful countenance, but\r\ndetermined voice, she said to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cIt can no longer be of any\r\nconsequence to you, that I should become yours; I promised myself to a\r\nyouth who had the fear of God in his heart; but a man who had\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94were you safe from the law, were you secure from vengeance, were\r\nyou the son of a king\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, in a voice of uncontrollable passion, \xe2\x80\x9cwell! I\r\nshall not have you, then; but neither shall he; of _that_ you may\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, do not talk thus; do not talk so fiercely!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou to implore me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, somewhat appeased. \xe2\x80\x9cYou! who will do\r\nnothing for _me_! What proof do you give me of your affection? Have I\r\nnot supplicated in vain? Have I been able to obtain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the curate\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow;\r\nnow, if you wish it. Only be yourself again; I will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you promise me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, softening immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, much relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with an accent of timid reproach, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou have also promised me to refer it to Father Christopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! will you now draw back?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, again alarmed, \xe2\x80\x9cno, no, I have promised, and will\r\nperform. But you have compelled me to it by your own impetuosity. God\r\nforbid that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will you prognosticate evil, Lucy? God knows we wrong no person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cI will hope for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo would have wished to prolong the conversation, in order to allot\r\nto each their several parts for the morrow, but the night drew on, and\r\nhe reluctantly felt himself compelled to depart.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed, by all three, in that state of agitation and\r\ntrouble which always precedes an important enterprise whose issue is\r\nuncertain. Renzo returned early in the morning, and Agnes and he busied\r\nthemselves in concerting the operations of the evening. Lucy was a mere\r\nspectator; but although she disapproved these measures in her heart, she\r\nstill promised to do the best she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go to the convent, to speak to Father Christopher, as he\r\ndesired you last night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes to Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe father would soon read in my countenance that\r\nthere was something on foot; and if he interrogated me, I should be\r\nobliged to tell him. You had better send some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send Menico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, as he hurried off to make farther\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nAgnes went to a neighbouring house to obtain Menico, a smart lad of\r\ntwelve years of age, who, by the way of cousins and sisters-in-law, was\r\na sort of nephew to the dame. She asked and obtained permission of his\r\nparents to keep him all day \xe2\x80\x9cfor a particular service.\xe2\x80\x9d She took him\r\nhome, and after giving him breakfast, told him he must go to\r\nPescarenico, and show himself to Father Christopher, who would send him\r\nback with a message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Father Christopher_, you understand; that nice old man, with a white\r\nbeard; him they call the Saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know him, I know him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Menico: \xe2\x80\x9che speaks so kindly to the\r\nchildren, and often gives them pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! that is he; and if, Menico, if he tells you to wait near the\r\nconvent until he has an answer ready, don\xe2\x80\x99t stray away; don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the\r\nlake to throw stones in the water with the boys; nor to see them fish,\r\nnor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh! aunt, I am no longer a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, behave well, and when you return with the answer, I will give you\r\nthese new _parpagliole_.\xe2\x80\x9d[3]\r\n\r\n      [3] A sort of coin.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of this long morning, several strange things\r\noccurred, calculated to infuse suspicion into the already troubled minds\r\nof Lucy and her mother. A mendicant, but not in rags like others of his\r\nkind, and with a dark and sinister countenance, narrowly observing every\r\nobject around him, entered to ask alms. A piece of bread was presented\r\nto him, which he received with ill-dissembled indifference. Then, with a\r\nmixture of impudence and hesitation, he made many enquiries, to which\r\nAgnes endeavoured to return evasive replies. When about to depart, he\r\npretended to mistake the door, and went through the one that led to the\r\nstairs. They called to him, \xe2\x80\x9cStay, stay! where are you going, good man?\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x9d He returned, excusing himself with an affectation of\r\nhumility, to which he felt it difficult to compose his hard and stern\r\nfeatures. After him, they saw pass, from time to time, other strange\r\npeople. One entered the house, under pretence of asking the road;\r\nanother stopped before the gate, and glanced furtively into the room, as\r\nif to avoid suspicion. Agnes went often to the door of the house during\r\nthe remainder of the day, with an undefined dread of seeing some one\r\napproach who might cause them alarm. These mysterious visitations,\r\nhowever, ceased towards noon, but they had left an impression of\r\nimpending evil on their minds, which they felt it impossible altogether\r\nto suppress.\r\n\r\nTo explain to the reader the true character of these suspicious\r\nwanderers, we must recur to Don Roderick, whom we left alone, in the\r\nhall of his palace, at the departure of Father Christopher. The more he\r\nreflected on his interview with the friar, the more was he enraged and\r\nashamed, that he should have dared to come to him with the rebuke of\r\nNathan to David on his lips. He paced with hurried steps through the\r\napartment, and as he gazed at the portraits of his ancestors, warriors,\r\nsenators, and abbots, which hung against its walls, he felt his\r\nindignation at the insult which had been offered him increase. A\r\nbase-born friar to speak thus to one of noble birth! He formed plans of\r\nvengeance, and discarded them, without his being willing to acknowledge\r\nit to himself. The prediction of the father again sounded in his ears,\r\nand caused an unaccustomed perplexity. Restless and undetermined, he\r\nrang the bell, and ordered a servant to excuse him to the company, and\r\nto say to them, that urgent business prevented his seeing them again.\r\nThe servant returned with the intelligence that the guests had departed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Count Attilio?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Roderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone with the gentlemen, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; six followers to accompany me; quickly. My sword, cloak, and hat.\r\nBe quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant left the room, and returned in a few moments with a rich\r\nsword, which his master girded on; he then threw the cloak around his\r\nshoulders, and donned his hat with its waving plumes with an air of\r\nproud defiance. He then passed into the street, followed by six armed\r\nruffians, taking the road to Lecco. The peasantry and tradesmen shrunk\r\nfrom his approach; their profound and timid salutations received no\r\nnotice from him; indeed, he acknowledged but by a slight inclination of\r\nthe head those of the neighbouring gentry, whose rank, however, was\r\nincontestably inferior to his own. Indeed, the only man whose\r\nsalutations he condescended to return upon an equal footing was the\r\nSpanish governor. In order to get rid of his _ennui_, and banish the\r\nidea of the monk and his imprecations, he entered the house of a\r\ngentleman, where a party was met together, and was received with that\r\napparent cordiality which it is a necessary policy to manifest towards\r\nthe powerful who are held in fear. On his return at night to his palace,\r\nhe found Count Attilio seated at supper. Don Roderick, full of thought,\r\ntook a chair, but said little.\r\n\r\nScarcely was the table cleared, and the servants departed, when the\r\ncount, beginning to rally his dull companion, said, \xe2\x80\x9cCousin, when will\r\nyou pay me my wager?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSan Martin\xe2\x80\x99s day has not yet passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you will have to pay it; for all the saints in the calendar may\r\npass, before you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see about that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin, you would play the politician, but you cannot deceive me; I am\r\nso certain that I have won the wager, that I stand ready for another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? because the father\xe2\x80\x94the father\xe2\x80\x94in short, this friar has converted\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of your fine imaginations, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConverted, cousin, converted, I tell you; I rejoice at it; it will be a\r\nfine spectacle to see you penitent, with your eyes cast down! And how\r\nflattering to the father! he don\xe2\x80\x99t catch such fish every day. Be\r\nassured, he will bring you forward as an example to others; your actions\r\nwill be trumpeted from the pulpit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, enough!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Don Roderick, half annoyed, and half\r\ndisposed to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI will double the wager with you, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! perhaps _you_ have converted the father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak of him; but as to the wager, San Martin will decide.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ncuriosity of the count was aroused; he made many enquiries, which Don\r\nRoderick evaded, referring him to the day of decision.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, when he awoke, Don Roderick was \xe2\x80\x9chimself again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe various emotions that had agitated him after his interview with the\r\nfather, had now resolved themselves into the simple desire of revenge.\r\nHardly risen, he sent for Griso.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSomething serious,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\nservant to whom the order was given; as this _Griso_ was nothing less\r\nthan the leader of the _bravoes_ to whom was intrusted the most\r\ndangerous and daring enterprises, who was the most trusted by the\r\nmaster, and the most devoted to him, from gratitude and interest. This\r\nman had been guilty of murder; he had fled from the pursuit of justice\r\nto the palace of Don Roderick, who took him under his protection, and\r\nthus sheltered him from the pursuit of the law. He, therefore, stood\r\npledged to the performance of any deed of villany that should be imposed\r\non him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGriso,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must show your skill in this\r\nemergency. Before to-morrow, this Lucy must be in this palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall never be said that Griso failed to execute a command from his\r\nillustrious protector.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake as many men as are necessary, and dispose of them as appears to\r\nyou best; only let the thing succeed. But be careful that no harm be\r\ndone to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor, a little fright\xe2\x80\x94we cannot do less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFright\xe2\x80\x94may be unavoidable. But touch not a hair of her head; and,\r\nabove all, treat her with the greatest respect. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor, I could not take a flower from the bush, and carry it to your\r\nHighness, without touching it; but I will do only what is absolutely\r\nnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; I trust thee. And\xe2\x80\x94how wilt thou do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking, signor. It is fortunate that her cottage is at the\r\nextremity of the village; we have need of some place of concealment; and\r\nnot far from her house there is that old uninhabited building in the\r\nmiddle of the fields, that one\xe2\x80\x94but, your Highness knows nothing of\r\nthese matters\xe2\x80\x94which was burnt a few years ago, and, not having been\r\nrepaired, is now deserted, except by the witches, who keep all cowardly\r\nrascals away from it; so that we may take safe possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Griso went on to propose, and Don Roderick to approve, until they\r\nhad agreed upon the manner of conducting the enterprise to the desired\r\nconclusion, without leaving a trace of the authors of it: and also upon\r\nthe manner of imposing silence, not only upon poor Agnes, but also upon\r\nthe more impatient and fiery Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this rash fellow fall in your way by chance,\xe2\x80\x9d added Don Roderick,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou had best give him, on his shoulders, something he will remember; so\r\nthat he will be more likely to obey the order to remain quiet, which he\r\nwill receive to-morrow. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, leave it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso, as, with an air of importance,\r\nhe took his leave.\r\n\r\nThe morning was spent in reconnoitring,\xe2\x80\x94the mendicant of whom we have\r\nspoken was Griso; the others were the villains whom he employed, to\r\ngain a more perfect knowledge of the scene of action. They returned to\r\nthe palace to arrange and mature the enterprise;\xe2\x80\x94all these mysterious\r\nmovements were not effected without rousing the suspicions of the old\r\ndomestic, who, partly by listening, and partly by conjecture, came to\r\nthe knowledge of the concerted attempt of the evening. This knowledge\r\ncame a little too late, for already a body of ruffians were laying in\r\nwait in the old house. However, the poor old man, although well aware of\r\nthe dangerous game he played, did not fail to perform his promise; he\r\nleft the palace on some slight pretence, and hurried to the convent.\r\nGriso and his band left shortly after, and met at the old building,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nformer had previously left orders at the palace, that, at the approach\r\nof night, there should be a litter brought thither,\xe2\x80\x94he then despatched\r\nthree of the bravoes to the village inn; one to remain at its entrance\r\nto observe the movements on the road, and to give notice when the\r\ninhabitants should have retired to rest; the other two to occupy\r\nthemselves within as idlers, gaming and drinking. Griso, with the rest\r\nof the troop, continued in ambush, on the watch.\r\n\r\nAll this was going forward, and the sun was about to set, when Renzo\r\nentered the cottage, and said to Lucy and her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cTony and Jervase\r\nare ready; I am going with them to sup at the inn; at the sound of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ave Maria,\xe2\x80\x99 we will come for you; take courage, Lucy, all depends on a\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9ccourage;\xe2\x80\x9d with a voice that contradicted her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nWhen Renzo and his companions arrived at the inn, they found the door\r\nblockaded by a sentinel, who, leaning on one side of it, with his arms\r\nfolded on his breast, occupied half its width; at the same time rolling\r\nhis eagle eyes first to the right and then to the left, displaying\r\nalternately their blacks and their whites. A flat cap of crimson velvet,\r\nplaced sideways, covered the half of the _long lock_, which, parted on a\r\ndark forehead, was fastened behind with a comb. He held in his hand a\r\nclub; his arms, properly speaking, were concealed beneath his garments.\r\nWhen Renzo evinced a desire to enter, he looked at him fixedly without\r\nmoving; of this, the young man, wishing to decline all conversation,\r\ntook no notice, but, beckoning to his companions to follow his example,\r\nslid between the figure and the door-post. Having gained an entrance, he\r\nbeheld the other two bravoes with a large mug between them, seated at\r\nplay; they stared at him with a look of enquiry, making signs to each\r\nother, and then to their comrade at the door. This was not unobserved by\r\nRenzo, and his mind was filled with a vague sentiment of suspicion and\r\nalarm. The innkeeper came for his orders; which were, \xe2\x80\x9ca private room,\r\nand supper for three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are those strangers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he of the landlord, when he came in to\r\nset the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! neither of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first rule of our trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, spreading the cloth, \xe2\x80\x9cis, not to\r\nmeddle with the affairs of others; and, what is wonderful, even our\r\nwomen are not curious. It is enough for us that customers pay well; who\r\nthey are, or who they are not, matters nothing. And now, I will bring\r\nyou a dish of polpette, the like of which you have never eaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the kitchen, and was employed in taking the polpette\r\nfrom the fire, one of the bravoes approached, and said, in an under\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cWho are those men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood people of this village,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host, pouring the mince-meat\r\ninto a dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; but what are their names? Who are they?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted he, in a rough\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is called Renzo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host; \xe2\x80\x9cesteemed a good youth, and an\r\nexcellent weaver of silk. The other is a peasant, whose name is Tony; a\r\njovial fellow,\xe2\x80\x94it is a pity he has no more money, for he would spend it\r\nall here. The other is a simpleton, who eats when they feed him. By your\r\nleave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he slipped past him, with the dish in his hand,\r\nand carried it to the place of its destination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, continuing the conversation from the\r\npoint at which it had been dropped, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know that they are\r\nhonest men, when you are not acquainted with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom their actions, my good fellow; men are known by their actions. He\r\nwho drinks wine without criticising it; he who shows the face of the\r\nking on the counter without prattling; he who does not quarrel with\r\nother customers, and, if he has a blow or two to give, goes away from\r\nthe inn, so that the poor host need not suffer from it; _he_ is an\r\nhonest man. But what the devil makes you so inquisitive, when you are\r\nengaged to be married, and should have other things in your head? And\r\nwith this mince-meat before you, which would make the dead revive?\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he returned to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe supper was not very agreeable; the two guests would have lingered\r\nover the unusual luxury; but Renzo, preoccupied, and troubled and uneasy\r\nat the singular appearance of the strangers, longed for the hour of\r\ndeparture. He conversed in brief sentences, and in an under tone, so\r\nthat he might not be overheard by them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odd thing it is,\xe2\x80\x9d blundered Jervase, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Renzo wishes to be\r\nmarried, and has needed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Renzo looked sternly at him. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep silence,\r\nyou beast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony to him, accompanying the epithet with a cuff.\r\nJervase obeyed, and the remainder of the repast was consumed in silence.\r\nRenzo observed a strict sobriety, in order to keep his companions under\r\nsome restraint. Supper being over, he paid the reckoning, and prepared\r\nto depart: they were obliged to pass the three men again, and encounter\r\na repetition of their eager gaze. When a few steps distant from the inn,\r\nRenzo, looking back, perceived that he was followed by the two whom he\r\nhad left seated in the kitchen. He stopped; observing this, they stopped\r\nalso, and retraced their steps.\r\n\r\nIf he had been near enough, he would have heard a few words of strange\r\nimport; \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a glorious thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the scoundrels,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithout reckoning the cash, if we could tell at the palace how we had\r\nflattened their ribs,\xe2\x80\x94without the direction, too, of Signor Griso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd spoil the whole work,\xe2\x80\x9d added the other; \xe2\x80\x9cbut see! he stops to look\r\nat us! Oh! if it were only later! But let us turn back, not to create\r\nsuspicion. People are coming on all sides; let us wait till they go to\r\ntheir rests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen was heard in the village the busy hum of the evening, which\r\nprecedes the solemn stillness of the night; then were seen women\r\nreturning from their daily labour, with their infants on their backs,\r\nand leading by the hand the older children, to whom they were repeating\r\nthe evening prayers; men with their spades, and other instruments of\r\nculture, thrown over their shoulders. At the opening of the cottage\r\ndoors, was discerned the bright light of the fires, kindled in order to\r\nprepare their meagre suppers; in the street there were salutations given\r\nand returned, brief and mournful observations on the poverty of the\r\nharvest, and the scarcity of the year; and at intervals was heard the\r\nmeasured strokes of the bell which announced the departure of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen Renzo saw that the two men no longer followed him, he continued his\r\nway, giving instructions, in a low voice, from time to time, to his two\r\ncompanions. It was dark night when they arrived at the cottage of Lucy.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\r\n    And the first motion, all the interim is\r\n    Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy endured many hours the anguish of such a dream; and Agnes, even\r\nAgnes, the author of the plot, was thoughtful and silent. But, in the\r\nmoment of action, new and various emotions pass swiftly through the\r\nmind: at one instant, that which had appeared difficult becomes\r\nperfectly easy; at another, obstacles present themselves which were\r\nnever before thought of, the imagination is filled with alarm, the limbs\r\nrefuse their office, and the heart fails at the promise it had given\r\nwith such security. At the gentle knock of Renzo, Lucy was seized with\r\nsuch terror, that, at the moment, she resolved to suffer any thing, to\r\nendure a separation from him for ever, rather than execute her\r\nresolution; but when, with an assured and encouraging air, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nis ready; let us begone,\xe2\x80\x9d she had neither heart nor time to suggest\r\ndifficulties. Agnes and Renzo placed her between them, and the\r\nadventurous company set forward. Slowly and quietly they took the path\r\nthat led around the village,\xe2\x80\x94it would have been nearer to pass directly\r\nthrough it, to Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s house, but their object was to avoid\r\nobservation. Upon reaching the house, the lovers remained concealed on\r\none side of it, Agnes a little in advance, so as to be prepared to speak\r\nto Perpetua as soon as she should make her appearance. Tony, with\r\nJervase, who did nothing, but _without_ whom nothing could be done,\r\ncourageously knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there, at this hour?\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from the window, which they\r\nrecognised to be that of Perpetua. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one is sick, that I know of. What\r\nis the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tony, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my brother; we want to speak with the\r\ncurate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this an hour for Christians?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Perpetua, briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me; I will come, or not, as I choose; I have received I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nhow much money, and I have come to balance the small account that you\r\nknow of. I have here twenty-five fine new pieces; but if he cannot see\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94I know how and where to spend them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, wait. I will speak to you in a moment. But why come at this\r\nhour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can change the hour, I am willing; as for me, I am here, and, if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, wait a moment; I will give you an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, she\r\nclosed the window. As soon as she disappeared, Agnes separated herself\r\nfrom the lovers, saying to Lucy, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cCourage, it is but a\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d She then entered into conversation with Tony at the door, that\r\nPerpetua, on opening it, might suppose she had been accidentally passing\r\nby, and that Tony had detained her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarneades! who was he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio to himself, seated in his\r\nlarge chair, with a book open before him. \xe2\x80\x9cCarneades! this name I have\r\neither heard or read of; he must have been a man of study, a scholar of\r\nantiquity; but who the devil _was_ he?\xe2\x80\x9d Now, it should be known, that it\r\nwas Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s custom to read a little every day, and that a curate,\r\nhis neighbour, who had a small library, furnished him with books, one\r\nafter the other, as they came to hand. That with which he was at this\r\nmoment engaged, was a panegyric on St. Carlos, delivered many years\r\nbefore in the cathedral of Milan. The saint was there compared for his\r\nlove of study to Archimedes; which comparison the poor curate well\r\nunderstood, inasmuch as this did not require, from the various anecdotes\r\nrelated of him, an erudition very extensive. But the author went on to\r\nliken him also to Carneades, and here the poor reader was at fault. At\r\nthis moment, Perpetua announced the visit of Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt such an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect? They have no discretion. But if you do not shoot\r\nthe bird flying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows if I shall ever be able to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d continued he. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him\r\ncome in. But are you very sure that it is Tony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, as she descended, and, opening the door,\r\ndemanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTony appeared, in company with Agnes, who accosted Perpetua by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Agnes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cwhence come you at this hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d naming a neighbouring village. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have been delayed on your account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my account!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she; and turning to the two brothers, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in, and I will follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9ca gossiping woman of the company said\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nyou believe it?\xe2\x80\x94obstinately persisted in saying, that you were never\r\nengaged to Beppo Suolavecchia, nor to Anselmo Lunghigna, because they\r\nwould not have you. I maintained that you had refused them both\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I did. Oh! what a liar! oh! what a great liar! Who was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to make mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell me; you must tell me. Oh! what a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe how sorry I felt not to know all the\r\nstory, that I might have confuted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an infamous lie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to Beppo, every one\r\nknows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn front of Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s house, there was a short and narrow lane,\r\nbetween two old cottages, which opened at the farther end into the\r\nfields. Agnes drew Perpetua thither, as if for the purpose of talking\r\nwith her more freely. When they were at a spot, from which they could\r\nnot see what passed before the curate\xe2\x80\x99s house, Agnes coughed loudly.\r\n\r\nThis was the concerted signal, which, being heard by Renzo, he, with\r\nLucy on his arm, crept quietly along the wall, approached the door,\r\nopened it softly, and entered the passage, where the two brothers were\r\nwaiting their approach. They all ascended the stairs on tiptoe; the\r\nbrothers advanced towards the door of the chamber; the lovers remained\r\nconcealed on the landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Deo gratias_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony, in a clear voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTony, eh? come in,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice from within. Tony obeyed, opening\r\nthe door just enough to admit himself and brother, one at a time. The\r\nrays of light, which shone unexpectedly through this opening on the\r\ndarkness by which Renzo and Lucy were protected, made the latter tremble\r\nas if already discovered. The brothers entered, and Tony closed the\r\ndoor; the lovers remained motionless without; the beating of poor Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart might be heard in the stillness.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio was, as we have said, seated in his arm chair, wrapped in\r\na morning-gown, with an old cap on his head, in the fashion of a tiara,\r\nwhich formed a sort of cornice around his face, and shaded it from the\r\ndim light of a little lamp. Two thick curls which escaped from beneath\r\nthe cap, two thick eyebrows, two thick mustachios, a dense tuft along\r\nhis chin, all quite grey, and studding his sun-burnt and wrinkled\r\nvisage, might be compared to snowy bushes projecting from a rock by\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d was his salutation, as he took off his spectacles and placed\r\nthem on his book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the curate think I have come at too late an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony,\r\nbowing: Jervase awkwardly followed his example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, it is late; late on all accounts. Do you know that I am\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not hear that I was sick, and could not be seen? But why is\r\nthis boy with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor company, Signor Curate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; let us see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are twenty-five new pieces, with the image of St. Ambrose on\r\nhorseback,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony, drawing forth a little bundle from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio; and taking the bundle, he opened it,\r\ncounted the money, and found it correct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, you will give me the necklace of my Teela.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio; and going to an old press, he drew\r\nforth the pledge, and carefully returned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will please to put it in black and white?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9chow suspicious the world has become! Do you\r\nnot trust me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! Sir. If I trust you! you do me wrong. But since my name is on your\r\nbook on the side of debtor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Don Abbondio; and seating himself at the\r\ntable, he began to write, repeating, with a loud voice, the words as\r\nthey came from his pen. In the meanwhile, Tony, and, at a sign from him,\r\nJervase, placed themselves before the table, in such a manner as to\r\ndeprive the writer of a view of the door; and, as if from heedlessness,\r\nmoved their feet about on the floor, as a signal to those without, and\r\nalso for the purpose of drowning the noise of their footsteps; of this\r\nDon Abbondio, occupied in writing, took no notice. At the grating sounds\r\nof the feet Renzo drew Lucy trembling into the room, and stood with her\r\nbehind the brothers. Don Abbondio, having finished writing, read it over\r\nattentively, folded the paper, and reaching it to Tony, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nbe satisfied now?\xe2\x80\x9d Tony, on receiving it, retired on one side, Jervase\r\non the other, and, behold, in the midst, Renzo and Lucy! Don Abbondio,\r\naffrighted, astonished, and enraged, took an immediate resolution; and\r\nwhile Renzo was uttering the words, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Curate, in the presence of\r\nthese witnesses, this is my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d and the poor Lucy had begun, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthis is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he had snatched from the table the cloth which covered it,\r\nthrowing on the ground books, pen, ink, and paper, and in haste letting\r\nfall the light, he threw it over and held it wrapped around the face of\r\nLucy, at the same time roaring out, \xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua! Perpetua! treachery!\r\nhelp!\xe2\x80\x9d The wick, dying in the socket, sent a feeble and flickering light\r\nover the figure of Lucy, who, entirely overcome, stood like a statue,\r\nmaking no effort to free herself. The light died away, and left them in\r\ndarkness; Don Abbondio quitted the poor girl, and felt cautiously along\r\nthe wall for a door that led to an inner chamber; having found it, he\r\nentered, and locked himself in, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cPerpetua! treachery! help!\r\nout of the house! out of the house!\xe2\x80\x9d All was confusion in the apartment\r\nhe had quitted; Renzo, groping in the dark to find the curate, had\r\nfollowed the sound of his voice, and was knocking at the door of the\r\nroom, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cOpen, open; don\xe2\x80\x99t make such an outcry;\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy calling to\r\nRenzo, in a supplicating voice, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, let us go, for the love of\r\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d Tony, creeping on all fours, and feeling along the floor for his\r\nreceipt, which had been dropped in the tumult; the poor Jervase, crying\r\nand jumping, and endeavouring to find the door on the stairs, so as to\r\nescape with whole bones.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this turmoil, we cannot stop to make reflections; but\r\nRenzo, causing disturbance at night in another person\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\r\nholding the master of it besieged in an inner room, has all the\r\nappearance of an oppressor; when in fact he was the oppressed. Don\r\nAbbondio, assaulted in his own house, while he was tranquilly attending\r\nto his affairs, appeared the victim; when, in fact, it was he who had\r\ninflicted the injury. Thus goes the world, or rather, thus it went in\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe besieged, seeing that the enemy gave no signs of retreat, opened a\r\nwindow which looked out upon the churchyard, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe moon shone brightly\xe2\x80\x94every object could be clearly discerned as in\r\nthe day; but a deep repose rested over all\xe2\x80\x94there was no indication of a\r\nliving soul. Contiguous to the church, and on that side of it which\r\nfronted the parsonage, was a small habitation in which slept the sexton.\r\nAroused by this strange outcry, he jumped from his bed, opened the small\r\nwindow, with his eyelids glued together all the time, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun, Ambrose, run! help! people in the house!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncome in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, drawing in his head; he closed his\r\ncurtain, and half stupid, and half affrighted, thought of an expedient\r\nto bring more help than had been required of him, without risking his\r\nown life in the contest, whatever it might be. He hastily took his\r\nbreeches from the bed, and putting them under his arm, like an opera\r\nhat, ran to the belfry and pulled away lustily.\r\n\r\n_Ton, Ton, Ton_; the peasant aroused, sat up in his bed; the boy,\r\nsleeping in the hay-loft, listened eagerly, and sprang on his feet;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? What is it? Fire! Robbers!\xe2\x80\x9d Each woman entreated\r\nher husband not to stir, but to leave it to others: such as were cowards\r\nobeyed, whilst the inquisitive and courageous took their arms, and ran\r\ntowards the noise.\r\n\r\nLong before this, however, the alarm had been given to other personages\r\nof our story; the bravoes in one place; and Agnes and Perpetua in\r\nanother. It is necessary to relate briefly how the former had been\r\noccupied, since we last took leave of them; those at the old house, and\r\nthose at the inn. The latter, when they ascertained that the\r\ninhabitants of the village had retired to rest, and that the road was\r\nclear, went to the cottage of Lucy, and found that a perfect stillness\r\nreigned within. They then returned to the old house to give in their\r\nreport to Signor Griso. He immediately put on a slouched hat, with a\r\npilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s habit, and staff, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us act as becometh soldiers;\r\ncautious, quiet, and attentive to orders.\xe2\x80\x9d Then leading the way, he,\r\nwith his company, arrived at the cottage, by a route different from that\r\ntaken by our poor cottagers. Griso kept the band a few steps off, went\r\nforward alone to explore, and seeing all deserted and quiet on the\r\noutside, he beckoned to two of them, ordered them to mount very\r\ncarefully and quietly the wall which enclosed the court-yard, and to\r\nconceal themselves on the other side behind a thick fig-tree, which he\r\nhad observed in the morning. That being done, he knocked gently at the\r\ndoor, with the intention to call himself a pilgrim, who had wandered\r\nfrom his way, and request shelter until the morning. No answer; he\r\nknocked again, louder; not a sound! He then called a third robber, made\r\nhim also descend into the yard, with orders to unfasten the bolt on the\r\ninside, so that they might have free entrance. All was performed with\r\nthe utmost caution, and the most complete success. Griso then called the\r\nrest, and made some of them conceal themselves by the side of those\r\nbehind the fig-tree; he then opened the door very softly, placed two\r\ncentinels on the inside of it, and advanced to the lower chamber. He\r\nknocked; he waited\xe2\x80\x94and well might wait; he raised the latch; no one\r\nfrom within said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing could go on better. He then\r\ncalled the robbers from the fig-tree, and with them entered the room\r\nwhere he had in the morning so villanously received the loaf of bread.\r\nHe drew out his flint, tinder-box, and matches, and striking a light,\r\nproceeded to the inner chamber; it was empty! He returned to the stairs,\r\nand listened; solitude and silence! He left two to keep watch below, and\r\nwith the others carefully ascended the stairs, cursing in his heart the\r\ncreaking of the steps. He reached the summit, pushed softly open the\r\ndoor of the first room, and listened if any one breathed or moved: no\r\none! He advanced, shading his face with the lamp, and perceived a bed;\r\nit was made, and perfectly smooth, with the covering arranged in order\r\non the bolster! He shrugged his shoulders, and returning to the company,\r\nmade a sign to them, that he was going into the other room, and that\r\nthey should remain quietly behind,\xe2\x80\x94he did so, and had the same success;\r\nall deserted and quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he aloud; \xe2\x80\x9csome traitorous dog has played\r\nthe spy!\xe2\x80\x9d They then searched with less ceremony the rest of the house,\r\nputting every thing out of its place. Meanwhile those at the doorway\r\nheard a light step approaching in the street,\xe2\x80\x94they kept very quiet,\r\nthinking it would pass on; but, behold! it stopped exactly in front of\r\nthe cottage! It was Menico, who had come in haste from the convent, to\r\nwarn Agnes and her daughter to escape from the house, and take refuge\r\n_there_, because\xe2\x80\x94the _because_ is already known. He was surprised to\r\nfind the door unbolted, and entering with a vague sentiment of alarm,\r\nfound himself seized by two ruffians, who said in a menacing tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! be quiet, or you die!\xe2\x80\x9d He uttered a cry, at which one struck him\r\na blow on the mouth, the other placed his hand on his sword to inspire\r\nhim with fear. The boy trembled like a leaf, and did not attempt to\r\nstir; but all at once was heard the first sound of the bell, and\r\nimmediately after, a thundering peel burst forth. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wicked are always\r\ncowards,\xe2\x80\x9d says a Milanese proverb; alarmed at the sound, the bravoes let\r\ngo in haste the arms of Menico, and fled away hastily to the old house,\r\nto join the main body of their comrades. Menico, finding himself free,\r\nalso fled, by the way of the fields, towards the belfry, naturally\r\nsupposing he would find some one there. As to the other villains above\r\nstairs, the terrible sound made the same impression on them; amazed and\r\nperplexed, they hit one against the other, in striving to find the\r\nnearest way to the door. Nevertheless, they were brave, and accustomed\r\nto confront any known danger; but here was something unusual, an\r\nundetermined peril, and they became panic-struck. It now required all\r\nthe superiority of Griso to keep them together, so that there should be\r\na retreat, and not a flight. He succeeded, however, in assembling them\r\nin the middle of the court-yard. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt, halt,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cpistols in\r\nhand, knives ready, all in order, and then we will march. Cowards! for\r\nshame! fall behind me, and keep together.\xe2\x80\x9d Reduced to order, they\r\nfollowed him in silence.\r\n\r\nWe will leave them, in order to give an account of Agnes and Perpetua,\r\nwhom we left at the end of the little lane, engaged in conversation.\r\nAgnes had managed to draw the latter off to some distance, by dint of\r\nappearing to give great heed to her story, which she urged on by an\r\noccasional \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; now I comprehend; that is plain; and then? and\r\nhe? and you?\xe2\x80\x9d In the midst of an important part of her narrative, the\r\ndeep silence of the night was broken by the cry of Don Abbondio for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_help!_\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMercy! what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perpetua, and prepared to\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Agnes, holding her by\r\nthe gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy! did you not hear?\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, struggling to get free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Agnes, holding her\r\nfirmly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil of a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Perpetua, still struggling. Then was heard\r\nat a distance the light scream of Menico.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Agnes also, and they both ran at full speed; the sound of\r\nthe bell, which now succeeded, spurred them on. Perpetua arrived first,\r\nand, behold, at the door, Tony, Jervase, Renzo, and Lucy, who had found\r\nthe stairs, and, at the terrible sound of the bell, were flying to some\r\nplace of safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perpetua, out of\r\nbreath, of the brothers. They answered her with a violent push, and fled\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you! what are you here for?\xe2\x80\x9d said she then to Renzo and Lucy.\r\nThey made no reply. She then ascended the stairs in haste, to seek her\r\nmaster. The two lovers (still lovers) stood before Agnes, who, alarmed\r\nand grieved, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are here! How has it gone? Why did the bell\r\nring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome, home!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the people gather.\xe2\x80\x9d But Menico now\r\nappeared running to meet them. He was out of breath, and hardly able to\r\ncry out, \xe2\x80\x9cBack! back! by the way of the convent. There is the devil at\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, panting; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him, I did; he was going to\r\nkill me. The Father Christopher says you must come quickly.\xe2\x80\x94I saw him,\r\nI did.\xe2\x80\x94I am glad I found you all here,\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you all when we are\r\nsafe off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo, who was the most self-possessed of the party, thought it best to\r\nfollow his advice. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us follow him,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, to the females. They\r\nsilently obeyed, and the little company moved on. They hastily crossed\r\nthe churchyard, passing through a private street, into the fields. They\r\nwere not many paces distant, before the people began to collect, each\r\none asking of his neighbour what was the matter, and no one being able\r\nto answer the question. The first that arrived ran to the door of the\r\nchurch: it was fastened. They then looked through a little window into\r\nthe belfry, and demanded the cause of the alarm. When Ambrose heard a\r\nknown voice, and knew, by the hum, that there was an assemblage of\r\npeople without, he hastily slipped on that part of his dress which he\r\nhad carried under his arm, and opened the church door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this tumult? What is the matter? Where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it? Do you not know? Why, in the curate\xe2\x80\x99s house. Run, run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey rushed in a crowd thither; looked,\xe2\x80\x94listened. All was quiet. The\r\nstreet door was fastened; not a window open; not a sound within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is within there? Holla! holla! Signor Curate, Signor Curate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio, who, as soon as he was relieved by the flight of the\r\ninvaders, had retired from the window, and closed it, was now\r\nquarrelling with Perpetua for leaving him to bear the brunt of the\r\nbattle alone. When he heard himself called by name, by the people\r\noutside, he repented of the rashness which had produced this undesired\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened? Who are they? Where are they? What have they done to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d cried a hundred voices at a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one here now; I am much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x94Return to your\r\nhouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who _has_ been here? Where have they gone? What has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad people, bad people, who wander about in the night; but they have\r\nall fled.\xe2\x80\x94Return to your houses. I thank you for your kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he retired and shut the window. There was a general murmur of\r\ndisappointment through the crowd. Some laughed, some swore, some\r\nshrugged up their shoulders and went home; but at this moment a person\r\ncame running towards them, panting and breathless. He lived at the house\r\nopposite to the cottage of Lucy, and had witnessed from the window the\r\nalarm of the bravoes, when Griso endeavoured to collect them in the\r\ncourt-yard. When he recovered breath, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do here,\r\nfriends? The devil is not here, he is down at the house of Agnes\r\nMondella. Armed people are in it. It seems they wish to murder a\r\npilgrim; but who knows what the devil it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! what! what!\xe2\x80\x9d And then began a tumultuous conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\ngo. How many are there? How many are we? Who are they?\xe2\x80\x94The constable!\r\nthe constable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the constable, from the midst of the crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhere, but you must assist me; you must obey.\xe2\x80\x94Quick;\xe2\x80\x94where is the\r\nsexton? To the bell, to the bell. Quick; some one run to Lecco to ask\r\nfor succour.\xe2\x80\x94Come this way.\xe2\x80\x9d The tumult was great, and as they were\r\nabout to depart for the cottage of Agnes, another messenger came flying,\r\nand exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cRun, friends;\xe2\x80\x94robbers who are carrying off a pilgrim.\r\nThey are already out of the village! On! on! this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this command they moved in a mass, without waiting the\r\norders of their leader, towards the cottage of Lucy. While the army\r\nadvances, many of those at the head of the column, slacken their pace,\r\nnot unwilling to leave the post of honour to their more adventurous\r\nfriends in the rear. The confused multitude at length reach the scene of\r\naction. The traces of recent invasion were manifest,\xe2\x80\x94the door open, the\r\nbolts loosened, but the invaders, where were they? They entered the\r\ncourt, advanced into the house, and called loudly, \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes! Lucy!\r\nPilgrim! Where is the pilgrim! Did Stephano dream that he saw him? No,\r\nno, Carlandrea saw him also. Hallo! Pilgrim! Agnes! Lucy! No reply! They\r\nhave killed them! they have killed them!\xe2\x80\x9d There was then a proposition\r\nto follow the murderers, which would have been acceded to, had not a\r\nvoice from the crowd cried out, that Agnes and Lucy were in safety in\r\nsome house. Satisfied with this, they soon dispersed to their homes, to\r\nrelate to their wives that which had happened. The next day, however,\r\nthe constable being in his field, and, with his foot resting on his\r\nspade, meditating on the mysteries of the past night, was accosted by\r\ntwo men, much resembling, in their appearance, those whom Don Abbondio\r\nhad encountered a few days before. They very unceremoniously forbade him\r\nto make a deposition of the events of the night before the magistrate,\r\nand, if questioned by any of the gossips of the villagers, to maintain a\r\nperfect silence on pain of death.\r\n\r\nOur fugitives for a while continued their flight, rapidly and silently,\r\nutterly overwhelmed by the fatigue of their flight, by their late\r\nanxiety, by vexation and disappointment at their failure, and a confused\r\napprehension of some future danger. As the sound of the bell died away\r\non the ear, they slackened their pace. Agnes, gathering breath and\r\ncourage, first broke the silence, by asking Renzo what had been done at\r\nthe curate\xe2\x80\x99s? He related briefly his melancholy story. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe to Menico, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the devil in the house? What did you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe boy narrated that of which he had been an eye-witness, and which\r\nimparted a mingled feeling of alarm and gratitude to the minds of his\r\nauditors,\xe2\x80\x94alarm at the obstinacy of Don Roderick in pursuing his\r\npurpose, and gratitude that they had thus escaped his snares. They\r\ncaressed affectionately the boy who had been placed in so great danger\r\non their account: Renzo gave him a piece of money in addition to the\r\nnew coin already promised, and desired him to say nothing of the message\r\ngiven him by Father Christopher. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, return home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause thy family will be anxious about thee: you have been a good\r\nboy; go home, and pray the Lord that we may soon meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy\r\nobeyed, and our travellers advanced in silence. Lucy kept close to her\r\nmother, dexterously but gently declining the arm of her lover. She felt\r\nabashed, even in the midst of all this confusion, at having been so long\r\nand so familiarly alone with him, while expecting that a few moments\r\nlonger would have seen her his wife: but this dream had vanished, and\r\nshe felt most sensitively the apparent indelicacy of their situation.\r\nThey at length reached the open space before the church of the convent.\r\nRenzo advanced towards the door, and pushed it gently. It opened, and\r\nthey beheld, by the light of the moon, which then fell upon his pallid\r\nface and silvery beard, the form of Father Christopher, who was there in\r\nanxious expectation of their arrival. \xe2\x80\x9cGod be thanked!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as they\r\nentered. By his side stood a capuchin, whose office was that of sexton\r\nto the church, whom he had persuaded to leave the door half open, and to\r\nwatch with him. He had been very unwilling to submit to this\r\ninconvenient and dangerous condescension, which it required all the\r\nauthority of the holy father to overcome; but, perceiving who the\r\ncompany were, he could endure no longer. Taking the father aside, he\r\nwhispered, to him, \xe2\x80\x9cBut Father\xe2\x80\x94Father\xe2\x80\x94at night\xe2\x80\x94in the church\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94shut\xe2\x80\x94the rules\xe2\x80\x94but Father!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOmnia munda mundis,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nhe, turning meekly to Friar Fazio, and forgetting that he did not\r\nunderstand Latin. But this forgetfulness was exactly the most fortunate\r\nthing in the world. If the father had produced arguments, Friar Fazio\r\nwould not have failed to oppose them; but these mysterious words, he\r\nconcluded, must contain a solution of all his doubts. He acquiesced,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; you know more than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Christopher then turned to our little company, who were standing\r\nin suspense, by the light of a lamp which was flickering before the\r\naltar. \xe2\x80\x9cChildren,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthank the Lord, who has preserved you from\r\ngreat peril. Perhaps at this moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and he entered into an\r\nexplanation of the reasons which had induced him to send for them to the\r\nconvent, little suspecting that they knew more than he did, and\r\nsupposing that Menico had found them tranquil at their home, before the\r\narrival of the robbers. No one undeceived him, not even Lucy, although\r\nsuffering the keenest anguish at practising dissimulation with such a\r\nman; but it was a night of confusion and duplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou perceive, my children, that this country is no\r\nlonger safe for you. It is your country, I know; you were born here; you\r\nhave wronged no one: but such is the will of God! It is a trial,\r\nchildren, support it with patience, with faith, without murmuring; and\r\nbe assured, there will come a day, in which you will see the wisdom of\r\nall that now befalls you. I have procured you a refuge for a season, and\r\nI hope you will soon be able to return safely to your home; at all\r\nevents, God will provide, and I his minister will faithfully exert\r\nmyself to serve you, my poor persecuted children. You,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\nturning to the females, \xe2\x80\x9ccan remain at \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. There you will be beyond\r\ndanger, and yet not far from home; go to our convent in that place, ask\r\nfor the superior, give him this letter, he will be to you another Friar\r\nChristopher. And thou, my Renzo, thou must place thyself in safety from\r\nthe impetuosity of others, and your own. Carry this letter to Father\r\nBonaventura, of Lodi, in our convent at the eastern gate of Milan; he\r\nwill be to you a father, will advise you, and find you work, until you\r\ncan return to live here tranquilly. Now, go to the border of the lake,\r\nnear the mouth of the Bione\xe2\x80\x9d (a stream a short distance from the\r\nconvent); \xe2\x80\x9cyou will see there a small boat fastened; you must say, \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nboat;\xe2\x80\x99 you will be asked for whom, answer, \xe2\x80\x98Saint Francis.\xe2\x80\x99 The boatman\r\nwill receive you, will take you to the other side, where you will find a\r\ncarriage, which will conduct you to \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. If any one should ask how\r\nFather Christopher came to have at his disposal such means of transport\r\nby land and by water, he would show little knowledge of the power\r\npossessed by a capuchin who held the reputation of a saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe charge of the houses remained to be thought of; the father received\r\nthe keys of them; Agnes, on consigning hers, thought with a sigh, that\r\nthere was no need of keys, the house was open, the devil had been there,\r\nand it was doubtful if there remained any thing to be cared for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9clet us pray together to the Lord,\r\nthat he may be with you in this journey, and always, and above all, that\r\nhe may give you strength to submit cheerfully to that which he has\r\nordained.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he knelt down; all did the same. Having prayed a\r\nfew moments in silence, he pronounced with a low but distinct voice the\r\nfollowing words: \xe2\x80\x9cWe pray thee also for the wretched man who has brought\r\nus to this state. We should be unworthy of thy mercy if we did not\r\nearnestly solicit it for him: he has most need of it. We, in our sorrow,\r\nhave the consolation of trusting in thee; we can still offer thee our\r\nsupplications, with thankfulness. But he\xe2\x80\x94he is an enemy to thee! Oh\r\nwretched man! He dares to strive against thee: have pity on him, O Lord!\r\ntouch his heart, soften his rebellious will, and bestow on him all the\r\ngood we would desire for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRising hastily, he then said, \xe2\x80\x9cAway, my children, there is no time to\r\nlose; God will go with you, his angel protect you: away.\xe2\x80\x9d They kept\r\nsilence from emotion, and as they departed, the father added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart\r\ntells me we shall soon meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d Without waiting for a reply, he\r\nretired; the travellers pursued their way to the appointed spot, found\r\nthe boat, gave and received the watchword, and entered into it. The\r\nboatmen made silently for the opposite shore: there was not a breath of\r\nwind; the lake lay polished and smooth in the moonlight, agitated only\r\nby the dipping of the oars, which quivered in its gleam. The waves\r\nbreaking on the sands of the shore, were heard deadly and slowly at a\r\ndistance, mingled with the rippling of the waters between the pillars of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nThe silent passengers cast a melancholy look behind at the mountains and\r\nthe landscape, illumined by the moon, and varied by multitudes of\r\nshadows. They discerned villages, houses, cottages; the palace of Don\r\nRoderick, raised above the huts that crowded the base of the promontory,\r\nlike a savage prowling in the dark over his slumbering prey. Lucy beheld\r\nit, and shuddered; then cast a glance beyond the declivity, towards her\r\nown little home, and beheld the top of the fig-tree which towered in the\r\ncourt-yard; moved at the sight, she buried her face in her hands, and\r\nwept in silence.\r\n\r\nFarewell, ye mountains, source of waters! farewell to your varied\r\nsummits, familiar as the faces of friends! ye torrents, whose voices\r\nhave been heard from infancy! Farewell! how melancholy the destiny of\r\none, who, bred up amid your scenes, bids you farewell! If voluntarily\r\ndeparting with the hope of future gain at this moment, the dream of\r\nwealth loses its attraction, his resolution falters, and he would fain\r\nremain with you, were it not for the hope of benefiting you by his\r\nprosperity. The more he advances into the level country, the more his\r\nview becomes wearied with its uniform extent; the air appears heavy and\r\nlifeless: he proceeds sorrowfully and thoughtfully into the tumultuous\r\ncity; houses crowded against houses, street uniting with street, appears\r\nto deprive him of the power to breathe; and in front of edifices admired\r\nby strangers, he stops to recall, with restless desire, the image of the\r\nfield and the cottage which had long been the object of his wishes, and\r\nwhich, on his return to his mountains, he will make his own, should he\r\nacquire the wealth of which he is in pursuit.\r\n\r\nBut how much more sorrowful the moment of separation to him, who, having\r\nnever sent a transient wish beyond the mountains, feels that they\r\ncomprise the limit of his earthly hopes, and yet is driven from them by\r\nan adverse fate; who is compelled to quit them to go into a foreign\r\nland, with scarcely a hope of return! Then he breaks forth into mournful\r\nexclamations. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell native cottage! where, many a time and oft, I\r\nhave listened with eager ear, to distinguish, amidst the rumour of\r\nfootsteps, the well-known sound of those long expected and anxiously\r\ndesired. Farewell, ye scenes, where I had hoped to pass, tranquil and\r\ncontent, the remnant of my days! Farewell, thou sanctuary of God, where\r\nmy soul has been filled with admiring thoughts of him, and my voice has\r\nunited with others to sing his praise! Farewell! He, whom I worshipped\r\nwithin your walls, is not confined to temples made with hands; heaven is\r\nhis dwelling place, and the earth his footstool; he watches over his\r\nchildren, and, if he chastises them, it is in love, to prepare them for\r\nhigher and holier enjoyments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf such a nature, if not precisely the same, were the reflections of\r\nLucy and her companions, as the bark carried them to the right bank of\r\nthe Adda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shock which the boat received, as it struck against the shore,\r\naroused Lucy from her reverie; they quitted the bark, and Renzo turned\r\nto thank and reward the boatman. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe: \xe2\x80\x9cwe are placed on earth to aid one another.\xe2\x80\x9d The carriage was ready,\r\nthe driver seated; its expected occupants took their places, and the\r\nhorses moved briskly on. Our travellers arrived then at Monza, which we\r\nbelieve to have been the name of the place to which Father Christopher\r\nhad directed Renzo, a little after sunrise. The driver turned to an inn,\r\nwhere he appeared to be well acquainted, and demanded for them a\r\nseparate room. He, as well as the boatman, refused the offered\r\nrecompence of Renzo; like the boatman, he had in view a reward, more\r\ndistant indeed, but more abundant; he withdrew his hand, and hastened to\r\nlook after his beast.\r\n\r\nAfter an evening such as we have described, and a night passed in\r\npainful thoughts both in regard to recent events and future\r\nanticipations\xe2\x80\x94disturbed, indeed, by the frequent joltings of their\r\nincommodious vehicle,\xe2\x80\x94our travellers felt a little rest in their\r\nretired apartment at the inn highly necessary. They partook of a small\r\nmeal together, not more in proportion to the prevailing want, than to\r\ntheir own slender appetites; and recurred with a sigh to the delightful\r\nfestivities, which, two days before, were to have accompanied their\r\nhappy union. Renzo would willingly have remained with his companions all\r\nthe day, to secure their lodging and perform other little offices. But\r\nthey strongly alleged the injunctions of Father Christopher, together\r\nwith the gossiping to which their continuing together would give rise,\r\nso that he at length acquiesced. Lucy could not conceal her tears; Renzo\r\nwith difficulty restrained his; and, warmly pressing the hand of Agnes,\r\nhe pronounced with a voice almost choked, \xe2\x80\x9cTill we meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter would have been in great perplexity, had it not\r\nbeen for the kind driver, who had orders to conduct them to the convent,\r\nwhich was at a little distance from the village. Upon their arrival\r\nthere, the guide requested the porter to call the superior: he appeared,\r\nand the letter of Father Christopher was delivered to him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, from\r\nFather Christopher!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, recognising the handwriting. His voice and\r\nmanner told evidently that he uttered the name of one whom he regarded\r\nas a particular friend. During the perusal of the letter, he manifested\r\nmuch surprise and indignation, and, raising his eyes, fixed them on Lucy\r\nand her mother with an expression of pity and interest. When he had\r\nfinished reading, he remained for a moment thoughtful, and then\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one but the signora; if the signora would take\r\nupon herself this obligation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and then addressing them, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfriends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will make the effort, and I hope to find you a\r\nshelter, more than secure, more than honourable; so that God has\r\nprovided for you in the best manner. Will you come with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe females bowed reverently in assent; the friar continued, \xe2\x80\x9cCome with\r\nme, then, to the monastery of the signora. But keep yourselves a few\r\nsteps distant, because there are people who delight to speak evil of\r\nothers, and God knows how many fine stories might be told, if the\r\nsuperior of the convent was seen walking with a beautiful young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94with women, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he went on before: Lucy blushed; the guide looked at Agnes,\r\nwho could not conceal a momentary smile; and they all three obeyed the\r\ncommand of the friar, and followed him at a distance. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is the\r\nsignora?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, addressing their conductor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signora,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a nun; that is, not a nun like the\r\nothers. She is not the abbess, nor the prioress; for they say that _she_\r\nis one of the youngest of them; but she is from Adam\xe2\x80\x99s rib, and her\r\nancestors were great people, who came from Spain; and they call her the\r\n_signora_, to signify that she is a great lady,\xe2\x80\x94every one calls her so,\r\nbecause they say that in this monastery they have never had so noble a\r\nperson; and her relations down at Milan are very powerful, and in Monza\r\nstill more so; because her father is the first lord in the country; for\r\nwhich reason she can do as she pleases in the convent,\xe2\x80\x94and moreover\r\npeople abroad bear her a great respect, and if she undertakes a thing,\r\nshe makes it succeed; and if this good father induces her to take you\r\nunder her protection, you will be as safe as at the foot of the altar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the superior arrived at the gate of the town, which was defended at\r\nthat time by an old tower, and part of a dismantled castle, he stopped\r\nand looked back to see if they followed him\xe2\x80\x94then advanced towards the\r\nmonastery, and, remaining on the threshold, awaited their approach. The\r\nguide then took his leave, not without many thanks from Agnes and her\r\ndaughter for his kindness and faithfulness. The superior led them to the\r\nportress\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and went alone to make the request of the signora.\r\nAfter a few moments he re-appeared, and with a joyful countenance told\r\nthem that she would grant them an interview: on their way, he gave them\r\nmuch advice concerning their deportment in her presence. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is well\r\ndisposed towards you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand has the power to protect you. Be\r\nhumble, and respectful; reply with frankness to the questions she will\r\nask you, and when not questioned, be silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey passed through a lower chamber, and advanced towards the parlour.\r\nLucy, who had never been in a monastery before, looked around as she\r\nentered it for the signora; but there was no one there; in a few\r\nmoments, however, she observed the friar approach a small window or\r\ngrating, behind which she beheld a nun standing. She appeared about\r\ntwenty-five years of age; her countenance at first sight produced an\r\nimpression of beauty, but of beauty prematurely faded. A black veil hung\r\nin folds on either side of her face; below the veil a band of white\r\nlinen encircled a forehead of different, but not inferior whiteness;\r\nanother plaited band encompassed the face, and terminated under the chin\r\nin a neck handkerchief, or cape, which, extending over the shoulders,\r\ncovered to the waist the folds of her black robe. But her forehead was\r\ncontracted from time to time, as if by some painful emotion; now, her\r\nlarge black eye was fixed steadfastly on your face with an expression of\r\nhaughty curiosity, then hastily bent down as if to discover some hidden\r\nthought; in certain moments an attentive observer would have deemed that\r\nthey solicited affection, sympathy, and pity; at others, he would have\r\nreceived a transient revelation of hatred, matured by a cruel\r\ndisposition; when motionless and inattentive, some would have imagined\r\nthem to express haughty aversion, others would have suspected the\r\nlabouring of concealed thought, the effort to overcome some secret\r\nfeeling of her soul, which had more power over it than all surrounding\r\nobjects. Her cheeks were delicately formed, but extremely pale and thin;\r\nher lips, hardly suffused with a feeble tinge of the rose, seemed to\r\nsoften into the pallid hue of the cheeks; their movements, like those of\r\nher eyes, were sudden, animated, and full of expression and mystery. Her\r\nloftiness of stature was not apparent, owing to an habitual stoop; as\r\nwell as to her rapid and irregular movements, little becoming a nun, or\r\neven a lady. In her dress itself there was an appearance of studied\r\nneglect, which announced a singular character; and from the band around\r\nher temples was suffered to escape, through forgetfulness or contempt of\r\nthe rules which prohibited it, a curl of glossy black hair.\r\n\r\nThese things made no impression on the minds of Agnes and Lucy,\r\nunaccustomed as they were to the sight of a nun; and to the superior it\r\nwas no novelty\xe2\x80\x94he, as well as many others, had become familiarised to\r\nher habit and manners.\r\n\r\nShe was, as we have said, standing near the grate, against which she\r\nleaned languidly, to observe those who were approaching. \xe2\x80\x9cReverend\r\nmother, and most illustrious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the superior, bending low,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is the poor young woman for whom I have solicited your protection,\r\nand this is her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth mother and daughter bowed reverently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is fortunate that I have\r\nit in my power,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning to the father, \xe2\x80\x9cto do some little\r\nservice to our good friends the capuchin fathers. But tell me a little\r\nmore particularly, the situation of this young woman, that I may be\r\nbetter prepared to act for her advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy blushed, and held down her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, reverend mother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Agnes\xe2\x80\x94but the father interrupted her;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis young person, most\r\nillustrious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9chas been recommended to me, as I have\r\ntold you, by one of my brethren. She has been obliged to depart secretly\r\nfrom her native place, in order to escape heavy perils; and she has need\r\nfor some time of an asylum, where she can remain unknown, and where no\r\none will dare to molest her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat perils?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, father, do not talk so\r\nenigmatically: you know, we nuns like to hear stories minutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are perils,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the father, \xe2\x80\x9cthat should not be told to the\r\npure ears of the reverend mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady,\r\nhastily, and slightly blushing. Was this the blush of modesty? He would\r\nhave doubted it, who should have observed the rapid expression of\r\ndisdain which accompanied it, or have compared it with that which from\r\ntime to time diffused itself over the cheek of Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sufficient to say,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the friar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a powerful lord\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nis not all the rich and noble who make use of the gifts of God for the\r\npromotion of his glory, as you do, most illustrious lady\xe2\x80\x94a powerful\r\nlord, after having persecuted for a long time this innocent creature\r\nwith wicked allurements, finding them unavailing, has had recourse to\r\nopen force, so that she has been obliged to fly from her home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApproach, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the signora. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that the father is\r\ntruth itself; but no one can be better informed than you with regard to\r\nthis affair. To you it belongs to tell us if this lord was an odious\r\npersecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy obeyed the first command, and approached the grating;\r\nbut the second, accompanied as it was with a certain malicious air of\r\ndoubt, brought a blush over her countenance, and a sense of painful\r\nembarrassment, which she found it impossible to overcome.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94reverend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d stammered she. Agnes now felt herself\r\nauthorised to come to her assistance. \xe2\x80\x9cMost illustrious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear testimony that my daughter hates this lord as the devil\r\nhates holy water. I would call him the devil, were it not for your\r\nreverend presence. The case is this: this poor maiden was promised to a\r\ngood and industrious youth; and if the curate had done his duty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very ready to speak without being interrogated,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nthe lady, with an expression of anger on her countenance, which changed\r\nit almost to deformity. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence; I have not to be informed that parents\r\nhave always an answer prepared in the name of their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgnes drew back mortified, and the father guardian signified to Lucy by\r\na look, as well as by a movement of the head, that now was the time to\r\nrouse her courage, and not leave her poor mother in the dilemma.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat my mother has told you is the truth. I\r\nwillingly engaged myself to the poor youth (and here she became covered\r\nwith blushes)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Pardon me this boldness; but I would not have you\r\nthink ill of my mother. And as to this lord (God forgive him!) I would\r\nrather die than fall into his hands. And if you do this deed of charity,\r\nbe certain, signora, none will pray for you more heartily than those\r\nwhom you have thus sheltered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, with a softened voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will see\r\nyou alone. Not that I need farther explanation, nor other motives to\r\naccede to the wishes of the father superior,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, turning to him\r\nwith studied politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking,\r\nand this is what has occurred to me. The portress of the monastery has\r\nbestowed in marriage, a few days since, her last daughter; these females\r\ncan occupy her room, and supply her place in the little services which\r\nit was her office to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father would have expressed his thanks, but the lady interrupted\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need of ceremony; in case of need, I would not\r\nhesitate to ask assistance of the capuchin fathers. In short,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nshe, with a smile, in which appeared a degree of bitter irony, \xe2\x80\x9care we\r\nnot brothers and sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she called a nun, her attendant (by a singular distinction\r\nshe had two assigned for her private service), and sent her to inform\r\nthe abbess; she then called the portress, and made with her and Agnes\r\nthe necessary arrangements. Then taking leave of the superior, she\r\ndismissed Agnes to her room, but retained Lucy. The signora, who, in\r\npresence of a capuchin, had studied her actions and her words, thought\r\nno longer of putting a restraint on them before an inexperienced country\r\ngirl. Her discourse became by degrees so strange, that, in order to\r\naccount for it, we will relate the previous history of this unhappy and\r\nmisguided person.\r\n\r\nShe was the youngest daughter of the Prince ***, a great Milanese\r\nnobleman, who was among the wealthiest of the city. The magnificent\r\nideas he entertained of his rank, made him suppose his wealth hardly\r\nsufficient to support it properly; he therefore determined to preserve\r\nhis riches with the greatest care. How many children he had does not\r\nclearly appear; it is only known that he had destined to the cloister\r\nall the youngest of both sexes, in order to preserve his fortune for the\r\neldest son. The condition of the unhappy signora had been settled even\r\nbefore her birth; it remained only to be decided whether she were to be\r\na monk or a nun. At her birth, the prince her father, wishing to give\r\nher a name which could recall at every moment the idea of a cloister,\r\nand which had been borne by a saint of a noble family, called her\r\nGertrude. Dolls, clothed like nuns, were the first toys that were put\r\ninto her hands; then pictures of nuns; and these gifts were accompanied\r\nwith many injunctions to be careful of them, for they were precious\r\nthings. When the prince or princess, or the young prince, who was the\r\nonly one of the children brought up at home, wished to praise the beauty\r\nof the infant, they found no way of expressing their ideas, except in\r\nexclamations of this sort, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mother abbess!\xe2\x80\x9d But no one ever said\r\ndirectly to her, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must be a nun;\xe2\x80\x9d such an intention, however, was\r\nunderstood, and included in every conversation regarding her future\r\ndestiny. If, sometimes, the little Gertrude betrayed perversity and\r\nimpetuosity of temper, they would say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cThou art but a child, and\r\nthese manners are not becoming: wait till thou art the mother abbess,\r\nand then thou shalt command with a rod; thou shalt do whatever pleases\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d At other times, reprehending her for the freedom and familiarity\r\nof her manners, the prince would say, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch should not be the deportment\r\nof one like you; if you wish at some future day to have the respect of\r\nall around you, learn now to have more gravity; remember that you will\r\nbe the first in the monastery, because noble blood bears sway every\r\nwhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy such conversations as these the implicit idea was produced in the\r\nmind of the child, that she was to be a nun. The manners of the prince\r\nwere habitually austere and repulsive; and, with respect to the\r\ndestination of the child, his resolution appeared fixed as fate. At six\r\nyears of age she was placed for her education in the monastery where we\r\nfind her: her father, being the most powerful noble in Monza, enjoyed\r\nthere great authority; and his daughter, consequently, would receive\r\nthose distinctions, with those allurements, which might lead her to\r\nselect it for her perpetual abode. The abbess and nuns, rejoicing at the\r\nacquisition of such powerful friendship, received with great gratitude\r\nthe honour conferred in preference on them, and entered with avidity\r\ninto the views of the prince; Gertrude experienced all sorts of favours\r\nand indulgences, and, child as she was, the respectful attention of the\r\nnuns towards her was exercised with the same deference as if she had\r\nbeen the abbess herself! Not that they were all pledged to draw the poor\r\nchild into the snare; many acted with simplicity, and through\r\ntenderness, merely following the example of those around them; if the\r\nsuspicions of others were excited, they kept silence, so as not to cause\r\nuseless disturbance; some, indeed, more discriminating and\r\ncompassionate, pitied the poor child as being the object of artifices,\r\nto the like of which they themselves had been the victims.\r\n\r\nThings would have proceeded agreeably to the wishes of all concerned,\r\nhad Gertrude been the only child in the monastery; but this was not the\r\ncase; and there were some among her school companions who were destined\r\nfor the matrimonial state. The little Gertrude, filled with the idea of\r\nher superiority, spoke proudly of her future destiny, expecting thereby\r\nto excite their envy at her peculiar honours: with scorn and wonder she\r\nperceived that their estimation of them was very different. To the\r\nmajestic but circumscribed and cold images of the power of an abbess,\r\nthey opposed the varied and bright pictures of husband, guests, cities,\r\ntournaments, courts, dress, and equipage. New and strange emotions arose\r\nin the mind of Gertrude: her vanity had been cultivated in order to make\r\nthe cloister desirable to her; and now, easily assimilating itself with\r\nthe ideas thus presented, she entered into them with all the ardour of\r\nher soul. She replied, that no one could oblige her to take the veil,\r\nwithout her own consent; that she could also marry, inhabit a palace,\r\nand enjoy the world; that she could if she wished it; that she _would_\r\nwish it, and _did_ wish it. The necessity of her own consent, hitherto\r\nlittle considered, became henceforth the ruling thought of her mind; she\r\ncalled it to her aid, at all times, when she desired to luxuriate in the\r\npleasing images of future felicity.\r\n\r\nBut her fancied enjoyment was impaired by the reflection, which at such\r\nmoments intruded itself, that her father had irrevocably decided her\r\ndestiny; and she shuddered at the recollection of his austere manners,\r\nwhich impressed upon all around him the sentiments of a fatal necessity\r\nas being necessarily conjoined with whatever he should command. Then\r\nwould she compare her condition to that of her more fortunate\r\ncompanions; and envy soon grew into hatred. This would manifest itself\r\nby a display of present superiority, and sometimes of ill-nature,\r\nsarcasm, and spite; at other times her more amiable and gentle qualities\r\nwould obtain a transitory ascendency. Thus she passed the period\r\nallotted for her education, in dreams of future bliss, mingled with the\r\ndread of future misery. That which she anticipated most distinctly, was\r\nexternal pomp and splendour; and her fancy would often luxuriate in\r\nimaginary scenes of grandeur, constructed out of such materials as her\r\nmemory could faintly and confusedly furnish forth, and the descriptions\r\nof her companions supply. There were moments when these brilliant\r\nimaginings were disturbed by the idea of religion; but the religion\r\nwhich had been inculcated to the poor girl did not proscribe pride, but,\r\non the contrary, sanctified it, and proposed it as a means of obtaining\r\nterrestrial felicity. Thus despoiled of its essence, it was no longer\r\nreligion, but a phantom, which, assuming at times a power over her mind,\r\nthe unhappy girl was tormented with superstitious dread, and, filled\r\nwith a confused idea of duties, imagined her repugnance to the cloister\r\nto be a crime, which could only be expiated by her voluntary dedication.\r\n\r\nThere was a law, that no young person could be accepted for the monastic\r\nlife, without being examined by an ecclesiastic, called the vicar of the\r\nnuns, so that it should be made manifest that it was the result of her\r\nfree election; and this examination could not take place until a year\r\nafter she had presented her petition for admission, in writing, to the\r\nvicar. The nuns, therefore, who were aware of the projects of her\r\nfather, undertook to draw from her such a petition; encountering her in\r\none of those moments, when she was assailed by her superstitious fears,\r\nthey suggested to her the propriety of such a course, and assured her,\r\nnevertheless, that it was a mere formality (which was true), and would\r\nbe without efficacy, unless sanctioned by some after-act of her own. The\r\npetition, however, had scarcely been sent to its destination, when\r\nGertrude repented of having written it; she then repented of this\r\nrepentance, passing months in incessant vicissitude of feeling. There\r\nwas another law, that, at this examination, a young person should not be\r\nreceived, without having remained at least a month at her paternal home.\r\nA year had nearly passed since the petition had been sent, and Gertrude\r\nhad been warned that she would soon be removed from the monastery, and\r\nconducted to her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, to take the final steps towards the\r\nconsummation of that which they held certain. Not so the poor girl; her\r\nmind was busied with plans of escape: in her perplexity, she unbosomed\r\nherself to one of her companions, who counselled her to inform her\r\nfather by letter of the change in her views. The letter was written and\r\nsent; Gertrude remained in great anxiety, expecting a reply, which never\r\ncame. A few days after, the abbess took her aside, and, with a mixed\r\nexpression of contempt and compassion, hinted to her the anger of the\r\nprince, and the error she had committed; but that, if she conducted\r\nherself well for the future, all would be forgotten. The poor girl\r\nheard, and dared not ask farther explanation.\r\n\r\nThe day, so ardently desired and so greatly feared, came at last. The\r\nanticipation of the trials that awaited her was forgotten in her\r\ntumultuous joy at the sight of the open country, the city, and the\r\nhouses. She might well feel thus, after having been for eight years\r\nenclosed within the walls of the monastery! She had previously arranged\r\nwith her new confidant the part she was to act. Oh! they will try to\r\nforce me, thought she: but I will persist, humbly and respectfully; the\r\npoint is, not to say _Yes_; and I will _not_ say it. Or, perhaps they\r\nwill endeavour to shake my purpose by kindness: but I will weep, I will\r\nimplore, I will excite their compassion, I will beseech them not to\r\nsacrifice me. But none of her anticipations were verified: her parents\r\nand family, with the usual artful policy in such cases, maintained a\r\nperfect silence with regard to the subject of her meditations; they\r\nregarded her with looks of contemptuous pity, and appeared to avoid all\r\nconversation with her, as if she had rendered herself unworthy of it. A\r\nmysterious anathema appeared to hang over her, and to keep at a distance\r\nevery member of the household. If, wearied with this proscription, she\r\nendeavoured to enter into conversation, they made her understand\r\nindirectly, that by obedience alone could she regain the affections of\r\nthe family. But this was precisely the condition to which she could not\r\nassent: she therefore continued in her state of excommunication, which\r\nunhappily appeared to be, at least partially, the consequence of her own\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things formed a sad contrast to the radiant visions\r\nwhich had occupied her imagination. Her confinement was as strict at\r\nhome as it had been in the monastery; and she, who had fancied she\r\nshould enjoy, at least for this brief period, the pleasures of the\r\nworld, found herself an exile from all society. At every announcement of\r\na visiter, she was compelled to retire with the elderly persons of the\r\nfamily; and always dined apart whenever a guest was present. Even the\r\nservants of the family appeared to concur with the designs of their\r\nmaster, and to treat her with carelessness, ill concealed by an awkward\r\nattempt at formality. There was one among them, however, who seemed to\r\nfeel towards her respect and compassion. This was a handsome page, who\r\nequalled, in her imagination, the ideal images of loveliness she had so\r\noften fondly cherished. There was soon apparent a change in her manner,\r\na love of reverie and abstraction, and she no longer appeared to covet\r\nthe favour of her family; some engrossing thought had taken possession\r\nof her mind. To be brief, she was detected one day in folding a letter,\r\nwhich it had been better she had not written, and which she was obliged\r\nto relinquish to her female attendant, who carried it to the prince, her\r\nfather. He came immediately to her apartment with the letter in his\r\nhand, and in few but terrible words told her, that for the present she\r\nshould be confined to her chamber, with the society only of the woman\r\nwho had made the discovery; and intimated for the future still darker\r\npunishments. The page was dismissed, with an imperative command of\r\nsilence, and solemn threatenings of punishment should he presume to\r\nviolate it. Gertrude was then left alone, with her shame, her remorse,\r\nand her terror; and the sole company of this woman, whom she hated, as\r\nthe witness of her fault, and the cause of her disgrace. The hatred was\r\ncordially returned, inasmuch as the attendant found herself reduced to\r\nthe annoying duty of a jailer, and was made the guardian of a perilous\r\nsecret for life. The first confused tumult of her feelings having in\r\nsome measure subsided, she recalled to mind the dark intimations of her\r\nfather with regard to some future punishment: what could this be? It\r\nmost probably was a return to the monastery at Monza, not as the\r\nsignorina, but as a guilty wretch, who, loaded with shame, was to be\r\ninclosed within its walls for ever! Now, indeed, her fancy no longer\r\ndwelt on the bright visions with which it had been so often busied; they\r\nwere too much opposed to the sad reality of her present condition. Such\r\nan act would repair all her errors, and change (could she doubt it) in\r\nan instant her condition. The only castle in which Gertrude could\r\nimagine a tranquil and honourable asylum, and which was not in the\r\n_air_, was the monastery, in which she now resolved to place herself for\r\never! Opposed to this resolution rose up the contemplations of many\r\nyears past: but times were changed, and to the depth in which Gertrude\r\nhad fallen, the condition of a nun, revered, obeyed, and feared, formed\r\na bright contrast. She was perpetually tormented also by her jailer,\r\nwho, to revenge herself for the confinement imposed on her, failed not\r\nto taunt her for her misdemeanor, and to repeat the menaces of her\r\nfather; or whenever she seemed disposed to relent, and to show something\r\nlike pity, her tone of protection was still more intolerable. The\r\npredominant desire of Gertrude was to escape from her clutches, and to\r\nraise herself to a condition above her anger or her pity. At the end of\r\nfour or five long days, with her patience exhausted by the bitter\r\nrailings of her keeper, she sat herself down in a corner of the chamber,\r\nand covering her face with her hands, wept in bitterness of soul. She\r\nexperienced an absolute craving for other faces and other sounds than\r\nthose of her tormentor; and a sudden joy imparted itself to her mind,\r\nfrom the reflection, that it depended only on herself to be restored to\r\nthe good-will and attentions of the family. Mingled with this joy, came\r\nrepentance for her fault, and a desire to expiate it. She arose, went to\r\na small table, and taking a pen, wrote to her father, expressing her\r\npenitence and her hope, imploring his pardon, and promising to do all\r\nthat might be required of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are moments in which the mind, particularly of the young, is so\r\ndisposed, that a little importunity suffices to obtain from it any thing\r\nthat has the appearance of virtuous sacrifice; as a flower scarcely\r\nbudded abandons itself on its fragile stem, ready to yield its sweets to\r\nthe first breeze which plays around it. These moments, which ought to be\r\nregarded by others with timid respect, are exactly those of which\r\ninterested cunning makes use, to insnare the unguarded will.\r\n\r\nOn the perusal of this letter, the prince saw the way opened to the\r\nfurtherance of his views. He sent for Gertrude; she obeyed the command,\r\nand, in his presence, threw herself at his feet, and had scarcely power\r\nto exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cPardon!\xe2\x80\x9d He made a sign to her to rise, and in a grave\r\nvoice answered, that it was not enough merely to confess her fault, and\r\nask forgiveness, but that it was necessary to merit it. Gertrude asked\r\nsubmissively, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat he would have her do?\xe2\x80\x9d To this the prince did not\r\nreply directly, but spoke at length of the fault of Gertrude: the poor\r\ngirl shuddered as at the touch of a hand on a severe wound. He\r\ncontinued, that even if he had entertained the project of settling her\r\nin the world, she had herself placed an insuperable obstacle to it;\r\nsince he could never, as a gentleman of honour, permit her to marry,\r\nafter having given such a specimen of herself. The miserable listener\r\nwas completely humbled!\r\n\r\nThe prince, then, by degrees softened his voice and manner to say, that\r\nfor all faults there was a remedy, and that the remedy for hers was\r\nclearly indicated; that she might perceive, in this fatal accident, a\r\nwarning that the world was too full of dangers for her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gertrude, overwhelmed with shame and remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you perceive it yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will\r\nspeak no more of the past; all is forgotten. You have taken the only\r\nhonourable way that remains for you; and because you _have_ taken it\r\nvoluntarily, it rests with me to make it turn to your advantage, and to\r\nmake the merit of the sacrifice all your own.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he rang the\r\nbell, and said to the servant who appeared, \xe2\x80\x9cThe princess and the prince\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued to Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to make them the sharers\r\nof my joy; I wish that they should begin at once to treat you as you\r\ndeserve. You have hitherto found me a severe judge; you shall now prove\r\nthat I am a loving father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Gertrude remained stupified; she thought of the \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nhad so precipitately suffered to escape from her lips, and would have\r\nrecalled it; but she did not dare; the satisfaction of the prince\r\nappeared so entire, his condescension so conditional, that she could not\r\npresume to utter a word to disturb it.\r\n\r\nThe princess and prince came into the room. On seeing Gertrude there,\r\nthey appeared full of doubt and surprise; but the prince, with a joyful\r\ncountenance, said to them, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold here the lost sheep! and let these be\r\nthe last words that shall recall painful recollections. Behold the\r\nconsolation of the family! Gertrude has no longer need of advice; she\r\nhas voluntarily chosen her own good. She has resolved, she has signified\r\nto me that she has resolved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She raised to him a look of\r\nsupplication, but he continued more plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she has resolved to\r\ntake the veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, well done,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed they both, overwhelming her with\r\nembraces, which Gertrude received with tears, which they chose to\r\ninterpret as tears of joy. Then the prince enlarged on the splendid\r\ndestiny of his daughter, on the distinction she would enjoy in the\r\nmonastery and in the country, as the representative of the family. Her\r\nmother and her brother renewed their congratulations and praises.\r\nGertrude stood as if possessed by a dream.\r\n\r\nIt was then necessary to fix the day for the journey to Monza, for the\r\npurpose of making the request of the abbess. \xe2\x80\x9cHow rejoiced she will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the prince; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure all the nuns will appreciate the honour\r\nGertrude does them. But why not go there to-day? Gertrude will\r\nwillingly take the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will order the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young prince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude submissively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, \xe2\x80\x9clet her decide; perhaps she does not\r\nfeel disposed to go to-day, and would rather wait until to-morrow. Say,\r\ndo you wish to go to-day or to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, in a feeble voice, glad of a short reprieve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, solemnly; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has decided to go\r\nto-morrow. Meanwhile I will see the vicar of the nuns, to have him to\r\nappoint a day for the examination.\xe2\x80\x9d He did so, and the vicar named the\r\nday after the next. In the interval Gertrude was not left a moment to\r\nherself. She would have desired some repose for her mind after so many\r\ncontending emotions; to have reflected on the step she had already\r\ntaken, and what remained to be done\xe2\x80\x94but the machine once in motion at\r\nher direction, it was no longer in her power to arrest its progress;\r\noccupations succeeded each other without interruption. The princess\r\nherself assisted at her toilette, which was completed by her own maid.\r\nThis effected, dinner was announced, and poor Gertrude was made to pass\r\nthrough the crowd of servants, who nodded their congratulations to each\r\nother. She found at the table a few relations of the family, who had\r\nbeen invited in haste to participate in the general joy. The young\r\nbride\xe2\x80\x94thus they called young persons about to enter the monastic\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94the young bride had enough to do to reply to the compliments which\r\nwere paid to her; she felt that each reply was a confirmation of her\r\ndestiny; but how act differently? After dinner came the hour of riding,\r\nand Gertrude was placed in a carriage with her mother and two uncles,\r\nwho had been among the guests. They entered the street Marina, which\r\nthen crossed the space now occupied by the public gardens, and was the\r\npublic promenade, where the nobility refreshed themselves after the\r\nfatigues of the day. The uncles conversed much with Gertrude, and one of\r\nthem in particular, who appeared to know every body, every carriage,\r\nand every livery, had something to tell of signor such an one, and\r\nsignora such an one; but checking himself, he said to his niece, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nyou little rogue! you turn your back upon all these follies; you are the\r\nrighteous person; you leave us worldlings far behind; you are going to\r\nlead a happy life, and take yourself to paradise in a coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned home in the dusk of the evening, and the servants,\r\nappearing with torches, announced to them that numerous visiters had\r\narrived. The report had spread, and a multitude of relations and friends\r\nhad come to offer their congratulations. The young bride was the idol,\r\nthe amusement, the victim of the evening. Finally, Gertrude was left\r\nalone with the family. \xe2\x80\x9cAt last,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had the\r\nconsolation of seeing my daughter in society becoming her rank and\r\nstation. She has conducted herself admirably, and has evinced that there\r\nwill be no preventive to her obtaining the highest honours, and\r\nsupporting the dignity of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d They supped hastily, so as to be\r\nready early in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Gertrude, her attendant, of whose insolence she\r\nbitterly complained to her father, was removed, and another placed in\r\nher stead. This was an old woman, who had been nurse to the young\r\nprince, in whom was centred all her hopes and her pride. She was\r\noverjoyed at the decision of Gertrude, who, as a climax to her trials,\r\nwas obliged to listen to her congratulations and praises. She talked of\r\nher numerous aunts and relatives, who were so happy as nuns; of the many\r\nvisits she would doubtless receive. She further spoke of the young\r\nprince, and the lady who was to be his wife, and the visit which they\r\nwould doubtless pay to Gertrude at the monastery, until, wearied out\r\nwith the conflicts of the day, the poor girl fell asleep. She was\r\naroused in the morning by the harsh voice of the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cUp, up,\r\nsignora, young bride! it is day; the princess is up, and waiting for\r\nyou. The young prince is impatient. He is as brisk as a hare, the young\r\ndevil; he was so from an infant. But when he is ready, you must not make\r\nhim wait; he is the best temper in the world, but that always makes him\r\nimpatient and noisy. Poor fellow, we must pity him, it is the effect of\r\ntemperament; in such moments he has respect to no one but the head of\r\nthe household; however, one day he will be the head; may that day be far\r\noff! Quick, quick, signorina! You should have been out of your nest\r\nbefore this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea of the young prince, risen and impatient, recalled the\r\nscattered thoughts of Gertrude, and hastily she suffered herself to be\r\ndressed, and descended to the saloon, where her parents and brother were\r\nassembled. A cup of chocolate was brought her, and the carriage was\r\nannounced. Before their departure, the prince took his daughter aside,\r\nand said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cCourage, Gertrude; yesterday you did well, to-day you\r\nmust excel yourself; the point is now to make a suitable appearance in\r\nthe country and in the monastery, where you are destined to hold the\r\nfirst station. They expect you, and all eyes will be on you. Dignity and\r\nease. The abbess will ask you what is your request; it is a mere form,\r\nbut you must reply that you wish to be admitted to take the veil in this\r\nmonastery, where you have been educated, and treated so kindly; which is\r\nthe truth. Speak these words with a free unembarrassed air, so as not to\r\ngive occasion for scandal. These good mothers know nothing of the\r\nunhappy occurrence; that must remain buried with the family. However, an\r\nanxious countenance might excite suspicion; show whose is the blood in\r\nyour veins; be polite and modest; but remember also, that in this\r\ncountry, out of the family, there is none your superior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring their ride, the troubles and the trials of the world, and the\r\nblessed life of the cloister, were the principal subjects of\r\nconversation. As they approached the monastery, the crowd collected from\r\nall parts; as the carriage stopped before the walls, the heart of\r\nGertrude beat more rapidly: they alighted amidst the concourse; all eyes\r\nwere fastened on her, and compelled her to study the movements of her\r\ncountenance; and, above all, those of her father, upon whom she could\r\nnot help fixing her regards, notwithstanding the fear he inspired. They\r\ncrossed the first court, entered the second, and here appeared the\r\ninterior cloister, wide open, and occupied by nuns. In front was the\r\nabbess, surrounded by the most aged of the sisterhood; behind these the\r\nothers, raised promiscuously on tiptoe, and farther back the lay\r\nsisters, standing on benches and overlooking the scene; whilst here and\r\nthere were seen, peeping between the cowls, some youthful faces, which\r\nGertrude recognised as those of her school companions. As she stood\r\nfronting the abbess, the latter demanded, with grave solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshe desired to have in this place, where nothing could be denied her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d began Gertrude; but, about to utter the words which were to\r\ndecide her destiny irrevocably, she felt her heart fail, and hesitating,\r\nshe fixed her eyes on the crowd before her. She beheld there the\r\nwell-known face of one of her companions, who regarded her with looks of\r\ncompassion and malice, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThey have caught the brave one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis sight required all her courage, and she was about to give a reply\r\nvery different from that which was expected from her, when, glancing at\r\nher father, she caught from his eye such an anxious and threatening\r\nexpression, that, overcome by terror, she proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cI am here to ask\r\nadmittance into this monastery, where I have been instructed so kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe abbess immediately expressed her regret, that the regulations were\r\nsuch as to prohibit an immediate answer, which must be given by the\r\ncommon suffrage of the sisterhood; but that Gertrude knew well the\r\nsentiments they entertained towards her; and might judge what that\r\nanswer would be. In the mean time nothing prevented them from\r\nmanifesting their joy at her request. There was then heard a confused\r\nmurmur of congratulations and rejoicing.\r\n\r\nWhilst the nuns were surrounding their new companion, and offering their\r\ncongratulations to all the party, the abbess expressed her wish to\r\naddress a few words to the prince at the parlour grating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cin obedience to our rules\xe2\x80\x94to fulfil a necessary\r\nform\xe2\x80\x94I must inform you\xe2\x80\x94that whenever a young person desires to\r\nassume\xe2\x80\x94the superior, which I am, though unworthily, is obliged to make\r\nknown to the parents that if\xe2\x80\x94they have forced the will of their\r\ndaughter, they will incur the pains of excommunication. You will\r\nexcuse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, yes, reverend mother. Your exactitude is very praiseworthy,\r\nvery just. But you cannot doubt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! imagine, prince, if\xe2\x80\x94but I merely speak by order; besides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94true, reverend mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter these few words, and a renewal of compliments and thanks, they\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nGertrude was silent during their ride; overcome and occupied by\r\nconflicting thoughts, ashamed of her own want of resolution, vexed with\r\nothers as well as herself, she was still meditating some way of escape,\r\nbut every time she looked at her father, she felt her destiny to be\r\nirrevocable. After the various engagements of the day were over,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndinner, the visits, the drive, the _conversazione_, the supper,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nprince brought another subject under discussion, which was the choice of\r\na godmother (so they called the lady who is selected as chaperone to the\r\nyoung candidate in the interval between the request for admission, and\r\nthe putting on of the habit); the duty of this person was to visit, with\r\nher charge, the churches, public palaces, the _conversazioni_, in short,\r\nevery thing of note in the city and its environs; so as to afford a peep\r\nat that world they were about to quit for ever. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must think of a\r\ngodmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause to-morrow the vicar of the nuns\r\nwill be here for the examination, and soon after that, Gertrude will be\r\nfinally accepted. Now the choice shall come from Gertrude herself,\r\nalthough contrary to usage; but she deserves to be made an exception,\r\nand we may confidently trust to her judgment in the selection.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen, turning to her, as if bestowing a singular favour, he continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one of the ladies who were at the _conversazione_ this evening,\r\npossesses the necessary qualifications for a godmother; any one of them\r\nwill consider it an honour; make your selection.\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude instantly\r\nfelt that the choice would be a renewal of consent; but the proposal was\r\nmade with such an air of condescension, that a refusal would have\r\nappeared to spring from contempt or ingratitude. Thus she took another\r\nstep, and named a lady who had been forward in attentions to her during\r\nthe whole evening. \xe2\x80\x9cA perfectly wise choice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, who had\r\nexpected no less. The affair had all been previously arranged; this lady\r\nhad been so much with Gertrude at the _conversazione_, and had displayed\r\nsuch kindness of manner, that it would have been an effort for her to\r\nthink of another. The attentions, however, of this lady were not without\r\ntheir object: she had also for a long time contemplated making the young\r\nprince her son; she, therefore, naturally interested herself in all that\r\nconcerned the family, and felt the deepest interest in her dear\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the imagination of Gertrude was occupied with the\r\nexpected examination, and with a vague hope of some opportunity to\r\nretract. At an early hour she was sent for by the prince, who addressed\r\nher in these words:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, my daughter; you have as yet conducted\r\nyourself admirably; to-day you must crown the work. All that has been\r\ndone, has been done with your consent. If, in the meanwhile, you had any\r\ndoubts, any misgivings, you should have expressed them; but at the point\r\nto which things have now arrived, it will no longer do to play the\r\nchild. The worthy man who is to come this morning, will put a hundred\r\nquestions to you, concerning your vocation; such as, whether you go\r\nvoluntarily, and the why and the wherefore. If you falter in your\r\nreplies, he will continue to urge you; this will produce pain to\r\nyourself, but might become the source of a more serious evil. After all\r\nthe public demonstrations that we have made, the slightest hesitation on\r\nyour part might place my honour in danger, by conveying the idea that I\r\nhad taken a mere youthful whim for a confirmed resolution, and that I\r\nhad thus acted precipitately; in this case, I should feel myself under\r\nthe necessity, in order to preserve my character inviolate, to reveal\r\nthe true motive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But, seeing the countenance of Gertrude all on\r\nflame, and contracting itself like the leaves of a flower in the heat\r\nwhich precedes a tempest, he stopped a moment, and then resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwell, all depends on yourself. I know you will not show yourself a\r\nchild; but recollect, you must reply with freedom, so as not to create\r\nsuspicion in the mind of this worthy man.\xe2\x80\x9d He then suggested the\r\nanswers to be made to the probable questions that would be put, and\r\nconcluded with various remarks upon the happiness that awaited Gertrude\r\nat the convent. At this moment the servant announced the arrival of the\r\nvicar, and the prince was obliged to leave his daughter alone to receive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe good man had come with a preconceived opinion that Gertrude went\r\nvoluntarily to the cloister, because the prince had told him so. It was\r\none of his maxims, however, to preserve himself unprejudiced, and to\r\ndepend only on the assertions of the candidates themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cSignorina,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cI come to play the part of the tempter; I come to suggest\r\ndoubts where you have affirmed certainties; I come to place before your\r\neyes difficulties, and ascertain if you have well considered them. You\r\nwill allow me to trouble you with some interrogatories?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gertrude.\r\n\r\nThe good priest then began to interrogate her in the form prescribed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel in your heart a free spontaneous resolution to become a\r\nnun? Have menaces, or allurements, or authority been made use of? Speak\r\nwithout reserve to one whose duty it is to ascertain the true state of\r\nyour feelings, and to prevent violence being done to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe true reply to such a question presented itself suddenly to the mind\r\nof Gertrude, with terrible reality. But to come to an explanation, to\r\nsay she was threatened, to relate the unfortunate story\xe2\x80\x94from this her\r\nspirit shrank, and she brought herself to the resolution of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbecome a nun, freely, from inclination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you had this intention?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the good priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always had it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, finding it easier after the first\r\nstep to proceed in falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the principal motive which has induced you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interrogator was not aware of the chord he touched; and Gertrude,\r\nmaking a great effort to preserve the tranquillity of her countenance,\r\namid the tumult of her soul, replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe motive is, to serve God, and\r\nto fly the perils of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas there never been any disgust? any\xe2\x80\x94excuse me\xe2\x80\x94caprice? Often\r\ntrifling causes make impressions which we deem will be perpetual, but\r\nthe causes cease\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gertrude, hastily; \xe2\x80\x9cthe cause is that which I have\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vicar, in order to execute his duty fully, persisted in his\r\nenquiries, but Gertrude was determined to deceive him. She could not for\r\na moment think of rendering the good man acquainted with her weakness;\r\nshe knew, indeed, that he could prevent her being a nun, but that this\r\nwould be the extent of his authority and his protection. When he should\r\nbe gone, she would still be left alone, to endure fresh trials from her\r\nfather and the family. Finding, therefore, a uniform answer to all his\r\nquestions, he became somewhat wearied of putting them, and, concluding\r\nthat all was as it should be, with many prayers for her welfare, he took\r\nhis leave. As he crossed the hall he met the prince, and congratulated\r\nhim on the good dispositions of his daughter. This put an end to a very\r\npainful state of suspense and anxiety on the part of the prince; who,\r\nforgetting his usual gravity, ran to his daughter, and loaded her with\r\npraises, caresses, and promises, and with a tenderness of affection in\r\ngreat measure sincere: such is the inconsistency of the human heart.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a round of spectacles and diversions, during which we cannot\r\nattempt to describe minutely or in order the emotions to which the heart\r\nof Gertrude was subjected. The perpetual change of objects, the freedom\r\nenjoyed by this change, rendered more odious to her the idea of her\r\nprison; still more pungent were the impressions she received in the\r\nfestivals and assemblies of the city. The pomp of the palaces, the\r\nsplendour of their furniture, the buzzing and festal clamour of the\r\n_conversazione_, communicated to her such an intoxication, such an eager\r\ndesire for happiness, that she thought she could encounter all the\r\nconsequences of a recantation, or even suffer death, rather than return\r\nto the cold shades of the cloister. But all such resolutions instantly\r\nfled as her eyes rested on the austere countenance of the prince.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the vicar of the nuns had made the necessary deposition, and\r\nliberty was given to hold a chapter for the acceptation of Gertrude. The\r\nchapter was held, and she was received! Wearied out with her long\r\nconflicts, she requested immediate admittance, which was readily\r\ngranted. After a noviciate of twelve days, full of resolves and\r\ncounter-resolves, the moment arrived when she finally pronounced the\r\nfatal \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d which was to exclude her from the world for ever. But even\r\nin the depths of the monastery she found no repose; she had not the\r\nwisdom to make a virtue of necessity, but was continually and uselessly\r\nrecurring to the past. She could not call religion to her aid, for\r\nreligion had no share in the sacrifice she had made; and heavily and\r\nbitterly she bore the yoke of bondage. She hated the nuns, because she\r\nremembered their artifices, and regarded them in some measure as the\r\nauthors of her misfortune; she tyrannised over them with impunity,\r\nbecause they dared not rebel against her authority, and incur the\r\nresentment of the powerful lord, her father. Those nuns who were really\r\npious and harmless, she hated for their piety itself, as it seemed to\r\ncast a tacit reproach on her weakness; and she suffered no occasion to\r\nescape without railing at them as bigots and hypocrites. It might,\r\nhowever, have mitigated her asperity towards them, had she known that\r\nthe black balls to oppose her entrance had been cast into the urn by\r\ntheir sympathetic generosity. She found, however, one consolation, in\r\nthe unlimited power she possessed, in being courted and flattered, and\r\nin hearing herself called the \xe2\x80\x9csignora.\xe2\x80\x9d But what a consolation! Her\r\nsoul felt its insufficiency, but had not the courage nor the virtue to\r\nseek happiness from the only source where it could be found. Thus she\r\nlived many years, tyrannising over and feared by all around her, till an\r\noccasion presented itself for a further developement of her habitual,\r\nbut secret feelings. Among other privileges which had been accorded to\r\nher in the monastery, was that of having her apartments on a side of the\r\nbuilding little frequented by the other nuns. Opposite to this quarter\r\nof the convent was a house, inhabited by a young man, a villain by\r\nprofession, one of those who, at this period, by their mutual\r\ncombinations were enabled to set at nought the public laws. His name was\r\nEgidio. From his small window, which overlooked the court-yard, he had\r\noften seen Gertrude wandering there from listlessness and melancholy.\r\nAllured rather than intimidated by the danger and iniquity of the act,\r\nhe dared one day to speak to her. The wretched girl replied!\r\n\r\nThen was experienced a new but not unmixed satisfaction; into the\r\npainful void of her soul was infused a powerful stimulus, a fresh\r\nprinciple of vitality: but this enjoyment resembled the restoring\r\nbeverage which the ingenious cruelty of the ancients presented to the\r\ncriminal, in order to strengthen him to sustain his martyrdom. A change\r\ncame also over her whole deportment; she was regular, tranquil,\r\nendearing, and affable; in such a degree, that the sisters congratulated\r\nthemselves upon the circumstance, little imagining the true motive, and\r\nthat the alteration was none other than hypocrisy added to her other\r\ndefects. This outward improvement, however, did not last long; she soon\r\nreturned to her customary caprices, and, moreover, was heard to utter\r\nbitter imprecations against the cloistral prison, in unusual and\r\nunbecoming language. The sisters bore these vicissitudes as well as they\r\ncould, and attributed them to the light and capricious nature of the\r\nsignora. For some time it did not appear that the suspicions of any one\r\nof them were excited; but one day the signora had been speaking with one\r\nof the sisters, her attendant, and reviling her beyond measure for some\r\ntrifling matter: the sister suffered a while, and gnawed the bit in\r\nsilence; but finally, becoming impatient, declared that she was mistress\r\nof a secret, and could advise the signora in her turn. From this time\r\nforward her peace was lost. Not many days after, however, this very\r\nsister was missing from her accustomed offices; they sought her in her\r\ncell, and did not find her; they called, and she answered not; they\r\nsearched diligently in every place, but without success. And who knows\r\nwhat conjectures might have arisen, if there had not been found a great\r\nopening in the wall of the orchard, through which she had probably made\r\nher escape. They sent messengers in various directions to pursue, and\r\nrestore her, but they never heard of her more! Perhaps they would not\r\nhave been so unfortunate in their search, if they had dug near the\r\ngarden wall! Finally, the nuns concluded that she must have gone to a\r\ngreat distance, and because one of them happened to say, she has taken\r\nrefuge in Holland, \xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said they, \xe2\x80\x9cshe has, without doubt, taken\r\nrefuge in Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d The signora did not believe this, but she had\r\ncertain reasons for encouraging the opinion, and this she did not fail\r\nto do. Thus the minds of the nuns became satisfied; but who can tell the\r\ntorments of the signora\xe2\x80\x99s soul? Who can tell how many times a day the\r\nimage of this sister came unbidden into her mind, and fastened itself\r\nthere with terrible tenacity? Who can tell how many times she desired to\r\nbehold the real and living person, for the company of this empty,\r\nimpassible, terrible shade? Who can tell with what delight she would\r\nhave heard the very words of the threat repeated in her mental ear,\r\nrather than this continual and fantastic murmur of those very words,\r\nsounding with a pertinacity of which no living voice could have been\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\nIt was about a year after this event, that we find Lucy at the\r\nmonastery, and under the protection of the signora. The reader may\r\nremember, that after Agnes and the portress had left the room, the\r\nsignora and Lucy had entered into conversation alone; the former\r\ncontinued her questions concerning Don Roderick, with a fearlessness\r\nwhich filled the mind of Lucy with astonishment, little supposing that\r\nthe curiosity of the nuns ever exercised itself upon such subjects. The\r\nopinions which were blended with these enquiries, were not less strange;\r\nshe laughed at the dread which Lucy expressed herself to have of Don\r\nRoderick, asking her if he was not handsome; and surmising that Lucy\r\nwould have liked him very well, if it had not been for her preference of\r\nRenzo. When again with her mother, the poor girl expressed her\r\nastonishment at such observations from such a source, but Agnes, as more\r\nexperienced, solved the mystery. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nyou have known the world as I have, you will cease to wonder at any\r\nthing. The nobility, some more, some less, some one way, some another,\r\nhave all a little oddity. We must let them talk, especially when we have\r\nneed of them; we must appear to listen to them seriously, as if they\r\nwere talking very wisely. Did you not hear how she interrupted me, as if\r\nI had uttered some absurdity? I did not wonder at it; they are all so.\r\nNotwithstanding that, Heaven be thanked, she seems to have taken a\r\nliking to you, and is willing to protect us; and if we would retain her\r\nfavour, we must let her say that which it shall please her to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA desire to oblige the superior, the complacency experienced in\r\nprotecting, the thought of the good opinions which would be the result\r\nof a protection thus piously extended, a certain inclination towards\r\nLucy, and also a degree of self-satisfaction in doing good to an\r\ninnocent creature, in succouring and consoling the oppressed, had really\r\ndisposed the signora to take to heart the fate of our poor fugitives.\r\nThe mother and daughter congratulated themselves on their safe and\r\nhonourable asylum. They would have wished to remain unknown to all; but\r\nthis, in a convent, was impossible; and one there was, besides, too far\r\ninterested in obtaining an account of one of the two, stimulated as his\r\npassion had been by the opposition he had encountered. We will leave\r\nthem for the present in their safe retreat, and return to the palace of\r\nDon Roderick, at the hour in which he was anxiously expecting the result\r\nof his wicked and villanous enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a pack of blood-hounds, after having in vain tracked the hare, return\r\ndesponding towards their master, with their ears down, and tails\r\nhanging, so, in this night of confusion, returned the bravoes to the\r\npalace of Don Roderick, who was pacing, in the dark, the floor of an\r\nupper uninhabited chamber. Full of impatience and uncertainty as to the\r\nissue of the expedition, and not without anxiety for the possible\r\nconsequences, his ear was attentive to every sound, and his eye to every\r\nmovement on the esplanade. This was the most daring piece of villany he\r\nhad ever undertaken; but he felt that the precautions he had used would\r\npreserve him from suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will dare to come here, and ask if\r\nshe is not in this palace? Should this young fellow do so, he will be\r\nwell received, I promise him. Let the friar come! yea, let him come. If\r\nthe old woman presumes so far, she shall be sent to Bergamo. As for the\r\nlaw, I do fear it not; the _podest\xc3\xa0_ is neither a boy nor a fool! Pshaw!\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to fear. How will Attilio be surprised to-morrow\r\nmorning; he will find I am not a mere boaster. But if any difficulty\r\nshould arise, he\xe2\x80\x99ll assist\xe2\x80\x94the honour of all my relatives will be\r\npledged.\xe2\x80\x9d But these anxious thoughts subsided as he reverted to\r\nLucy.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be frightened to find herself alone, surrounded only by\r\nthese rough visages: by Bacchus, the most human face here is my own, and\r\nshe will be obliged to have recourse to me\xe2\x80\x94to entreaty.\xe2\x80\x9d In the midst\r\nof these calculations he heard a trampling of feet, approached the\r\nwindow, and looking out exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is they! But the litter! the\r\ndevil! where is the litter? Three, five, eight, they are all there; but\r\nwhere is the litter? The devil! Griso shall render me an account of\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d He then advanced to the head of the stairs to meet Griso. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried he, \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Bully, Signor Captain, Signor \xe2\x80\x98Leave it to me!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is hard to meet with reproach, when one\r\nhas hazarded one\xe2\x80\x99s life to perform his duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow has it happened? Let us hear, let us hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he advanced\r\ntowards the room, followed by Griso, who related, as clearly as he\r\ncould, the occurrences of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast done well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast done all that thou\r\ncouldst\xe2\x80\x94but to think that this roof harbours a spy! If I discover him\r\nI will settle matters for him; and I tell thee, Griso, I suspect the\r\ninformation was given the day of the dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had the same suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso; \xe2\x80\x9cand if my master discovers\r\nthe scoundrel, he has only to trust him to me. He has made me pass a\r\ntroublesome night, and I wish to pay him for it. But there must be, I\r\nthink, some other cause, which we cannot at present fathom; to-morrow,\r\nSignor, to-morrow we will see clear water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been recognised by any one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso thought not; and after having given him many orders for the\r\nmorrow, and wishing to make amends for the impetuosity with which he had\r\nat first greeted him, Don Roderick said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo to rest, poor Griso! you\r\nmust indeed require it. Labouring all day, and half the night, and then\r\nto be received in this manner! Go to rest now; for we may yet be obliged\r\nto put your friendship to a severer test. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning Don Roderick sought the Count Attilio, who, receiving\r\nhim with a laugh, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSan Martin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pay the wager,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought indeed to have\r\nsurprised you this morning, and therefore have kept from you some\r\ncircumstances. I will now tell you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe friar\xe2\x80\x99s hand is in this business,\xe2\x80\x9d said his cousin, after having\r\nheard him through: \xe2\x80\x9cthis friar, with his playing at bo-peep, and giving\r\nadvice; I know him for a busybody and a rascal! And you did not confide\r\nin me, and tell me what brought him here the other day to trifle with\r\nyou. If I had been in your place he should not have gone out as he came\r\nin, of that be assured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! would you wish me to incur the resentment of all the capuchins in\r\nItaly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn such a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have forgotten there was\r\nany other capuchin in the world than this daring rascal; but the means\r\nare not wanting, within the pale of prudence, to take satisfaction even\r\nof a capuchin. It is well for him that he has escaped the punishment\r\nbest suited to him; but I take him henceforth under my protection, and\r\nwill teach him how to speak to his superiors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not make matters worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me for once; I will serve you as a relation and a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet; but I will certainly pay the friar. Let me see\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncount my uncle, who is one of the secret council, will do the service;\r\ndear uncle! How pleased I am when I can make him work for me, a\r\npolitician of his stamp! The day after to-morrow I will be at Milan, and\r\nin some way or other the friar shall have his due.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile breakfast was brought in, which however did not interrupt the\r\nimportant discussion. Count Attilio interested himself in the cause from\r\nhis friendship for his cousin, and the honour of the name, according to\r\nhis notions of friendship and honour; yet he could hardly help laughing\r\nevery now and then at the ridiculous issue of the adventure. But Don\r\nRoderick, who had calculated upon making a master-stroke, was vexed at\r\nhis signal failure, and agitated by various passions. \xe2\x80\x9cFine stories will\r\nbe circulated,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cof last night\xe2\x80\x99s affair, but no matter; as to\r\njustice, I defy it: it does not exist; and if it did, I should equally\r\ndefy it. Apropos, I have sent word this morning to the constable, to\r\nmake no deposition respecting the affair, and he will be sure to follow\r\nmy advice; but tattling always annoys me,\xe2\x80\x94it is enough that _you_ have\r\nit in your power to laugh at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well you have given the constable his message,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis great empty-headed, obstinate proser of a _podest\xc3\xa0_ is however a\r\nman who knows his duty, and we must be careful not to place him in\r\ndifficulty. If a fellow of a constable makes a deposition, the\r\n_podest\xc3\xa0_, however well intentioned, is obliged to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Don Roderick, with a little warmth,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou spoil\r\nmy affairs, by contradicting him, and laughing at him on every occasion.\r\nWhy the devil can\xe2\x80\x99t you suffer a magistrate to be an obstinate beast,\r\nwhile in other things that suit our convenience he is an honest man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, regarding him with an expression\r\nof affected surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that I begin to think you capable of\r\nfear? You take the _podest\xc3\xa0_ and myself to be in earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, have not you yourself said that we should be careful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; and when the question is serious, I will show you I am not a\r\nboy. Shall I tell you what I will do for you? I will go in person to\r\nmake the _podest\xc3\xa0_ a visit; do you not think he will be pleased with the\r\nhonour? And I will let him talk by the half hour of the count duke, and\r\nthe Spanish keeper of the castle, and then I will throw in some remarks\r\nabout the signor count of the secret council, my uncle; you know what\r\neffect this will have. Finally, he has more need of our protection, than\r\nyou have of his condescension. He knows this well enough, and I shall\r\nleave him better disposed than I find him, that you may depend upon.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he took his departure, leaving Don Roderick alone to wait the\r\nreturn of Griso, who had been, in obedience to his orders, reconnoitring\r\nthe ground, and ascertaining the state of the public mind with regard to\r\nthe events of the preceding night. He came at last, at the hour of\r\ndinner, to give in his relation. The tumult of this night had been so\r\nloud, and the disappearance of three persons from the village so\r\nmysterious, that strict and indefatigable search would naturally be made\r\nfor them; and on the other hand, those who were possessed of partial\r\ninformation on the subject were too numerous to preserve an entire\r\nsilence. Perpetua was assailed every where to tell what had caused her\r\nmaster such a fright, and she, perceiving how she had been deceived by\r\nAgnes, and feeling exasperated at her perfidy, had need of a little\r\nself-restraint; not that she complained of the deception practised on\r\nherself, of that she did not breathe a syllable; but the injury done to\r\nher poor master could not pass in silence, and that such an injury\r\nshould have been attempted by such worthy people! Don Abbondio could\r\ncommand and entreat her to be silent, and she could reply that there was\r\nno necessity for inculcating a thing so obvious and proper, but certain\r\nit is that the secret remained in the heart of the poor woman as new\r\nwine in an old cask, which ferments and bubbles, and if it does not send\r\nthe bung into the air, works out in foam between the staves, and drops\r\nhere and there, so that one can drink it, and tell what sort of wine it\r\nis. Jervase, who could scarcely believe that for once he knew a little\r\nmore than others, and who felt himself a man, since he had been an\r\naccomplice in a criminal affair, was dying to communicate it. And Tony,\r\nhowever alarmed at the thoughts of further enquiries and investigation,\r\nwas bursting, in spite of all his prudence, till he had told the whole\r\nsecret to his wife, who was not dumb. The one who spoke least was\r\nMenico, because his parents, alarmed at his coming into collision with\r\nDon Roderick, had kept him in the house for several days; they\r\nthemselves, however, without wishing to appear to know more than others,\r\ninsinuated that the fugitives had taken refuge at Pescarenico. This\r\nreport, then, became current among the villagers. But no one could\r\naccount for the attack of the bravoes: all agreed in suspecting Don\r\nRoderick; but the rest was total obscurity. The presence of the three\r\nbravoes at the inn was discussed, and the landlord was interrogated; but\r\nhis memory was, on this point, as defective as ever. His inn, he\r\nconcluded as usual, was just like a sea-port. Who was this pilgrim, seen\r\nby Stefano and Carlandrea, and whom the robbers wished to murder, and\r\nhad carried off? For what purpose had he been at the cottage? Some said\r\nit was a good spirit, come to the assistance of the inmates; others,\r\nthat it was the spirit of a wicked pilgrim, who came at night to join\r\nsuch companions, and perform such deeds, as he had been accustomed to\r\nwhile living; others, again, went so far as to conjecture that it was\r\none of these very robbers, clothed like a pilgrim; so that Griso, with\r\nall his experience, would have been at a loss to discover who it was, if\r\nhe had expected to acquire this information from others. But, as the\r\nreader knows, that which was perplexity to them, was perfect clearness\r\nto Griso. He was enabled, therefore, from these various sources, to\r\nobtain a sufficiently distinct account for the ear of Don Roderick. He\r\nrelated the attempt upon Don Abbondio, which accounted for the\r\ndesertion of the cottage, without the necessity of imagining a spy in\r\nthe palace: he told of their flight, which might be accounted for by the\r\nfear of the discovery of their trick upon Don Abbondio, or by the\r\nintelligence that their cottage had been broken into, and that they had\r\nprobably gone together to Pescarenico. \xe2\x80\x9cFled together!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don\r\nRoderick, hoarse with rage: \xe2\x80\x9ctogether! and this rascal friar! this friar\r\nshall answer it! Griso, this night I must know where they are. I shall\r\nhave no peace; ascertain if they are at Pescarenico; quick; fly; four\r\ncrowns immediately, and my protection for ever! this rascal! this\r\nfriar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso was once more in the field; and on the evening of this very day\r\nreported to his worthy master the desired intelligence, and by the\r\nfollowing means. The good man by whom the little party had been\r\nconducted to Monza, returning with his carriage to Pescarenico at the\r\nhour of vespers, chanced to meet, before he reached his home, a\r\nparticular friend, to whom he related, in great confidence, the good\r\nwork he had accomplished; so that Griso could, two hours after, inform\r\nDon Roderick that Lucy and her mother had taken refuge in a convent of\r\nMonza, and that Renzo had proceeded on his way to Milan. Don Roderick\r\nfelt his hopes revive at this separation; and having, during great part\r\nof the night, revolved in his mind the measures for effecting his wicked\r\npurpose, he aroused Griso early in the morning, and gave him the orders\r\nhe had premeditated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor?\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have I have not spoken clearly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would send some other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost illustrious signor, I am ready to sacrifice my life for my master,\r\nand it is my duty to do so; but you, you would not desire me to place it\r\nin peril?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour illustrious lordship knows well these few murders that are laid to\r\nmy account, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Here I am under the protection of your lordship, and\r\nin Milan the livery of your lordship is known, but in Monza _I_ am\r\nknown. And, your lordship knows, I do not say it boastingly, he who\r\nshould deliver me up to justice would be well rewarded, a hundred good\r\ncrowns, and permission to liberate two banditti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are like a vile cur, who has\r\nscarce courage to rush at the legs of such as pass by the door; and, not\r\ndaring to leave the house, keeps himself within the protection of his\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have given proof, signor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Griso, boldly, thus put on his mettle, \xe2\x80\x9cyour lordship\r\nmust forget my hesitation; heart of a lion, legs of a hare, I am ready\r\nto go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall not go alone; take with you two of the best; _Cut-face_\r\nand _Aim-well_, and go boldly, and show yourself to be still Griso. The\r\ndevil! people will be well content to let such faces as yours pass\r\nwithout molestation! And as to the bailiffs of Monza, they must have\r\nbecome weary of life to place it in such danger, for the chance of a\r\nhundred crowns! But I do not believe that I am so far unknown there,\r\nthat the stamp of my service should pass for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso, having received ample and minute instructions, took his\r\ndeparture, accompanied by the two bravoes; cursing in his heart the\r\nwhims of his master.\r\n\r\nIt now became the design of Don Roderick to contrive some way, by which\r\nRenzo, separated as he was from Lucy, should be prevented from\r\nattempting to return. He thought that the most certain means would be to\r\nhave him sent out of the state, but this required the sanction of the\r\nlaw; he could, for example, give a colouring to the attempt at the\r\ncurate\xe2\x80\x99s house, and represent it as a seditious act, and through Doctor\r\nAzzecca Garbugli give the _podest\xc3\xa0_ to understand that it was his duty\r\nto apprehend Renzo. But while he thought of the doctor as the man the\r\nmost suitable for this service, Renzo himself put an end to much further\r\ndeliberation on the subject by withdrawing himself.\r\n\r\nLike the boy who drives his little Indian pigs to the fold, whose\r\nobstinacy impels them divers ways, and thus obliges him first to apply\r\nto one and then to another till he can succeed in penning them all, so\r\nare we obliged to play the same game with the personages of our story.\r\nHaving secured Lucy, we ran to Don Roderick. Him we now quit to give an\r\naccount of Renzo.\r\n\r\nAfter the mournful parting which we have related, he set out,\r\ndiscouraged and disheartened, on his way to Milan. To bid farewell to\r\nhis home and his country, and what was more, to Lucy! to find himself\r\namong strangers, not knowing where to rest his head, and all on account\r\nof this villain! When these thoughts presented themselves to the mind of\r\nRenzo, he was, for the moment, absorbed by rage and the desire of\r\nrevenge; but when he recollected the prayer that he had uttered with the\r\ngood friar in the convent of Pescarenico, his better feelings prevailed,\r\nand he was enabled to acquire some degree of resignation to the\r\nchastisements of which he stood so much in need. The road lay between\r\ntwo high banks; it was muddy, stony, and furrowed by deep wheel tracks,\r\nwhich, after a rain, became rivulets, overflowing the road, and\r\nrendering it nearly impassable. In such places small raised footpaths\r\nindicated that others had found a way by the fields. Renzo ascended one\r\nof these paths to the high ground, whence he beheld, as if rising from a\r\ndesert, and not in the midst of a city, the noble structure of the\r\ncathedral, and he forgot all his misfortunes in contemplating, even at a\r\ndistance, this eighth wonder of the world, of which he had heard so much\r\nfrom his infancy. But looking back, he saw in the horizon the notched\r\nridge of mountains, and distinctly perceiving, among them, his own\r\n_Resegone_, he gazed at it mournfully a while, and then with a beating\r\nheart went on his way; steeples, towers, cupolas, and roofs soon\r\nappeared: he descended into the road, and when he perceived that he was\r\nvery near the city, he accosted a traveller, with the civility which was\r\nnatural to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so good, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, my good young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so good as to direct me by the shortest way to the convent\r\nof the capuchins, where Father Bonaventura resides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied, very affably, \xe2\x80\x9cMy good lad, there is more than one convent;\r\nyou must tell me more clearly what and whom you seek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo then took from his bosom the letter of Father Christopher, and\r\npresented it to the gentleman, who, after having read it, returned it,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eastern gate; you are fortunate, young man\xe2\x80\x94the convent you\r\nseek is but a short distance from this. Take this path to the left; it\r\nis a by-way, and in a little while you will find yourself by the side of\r\na long and low building; that is the _lazaretto_; keep along the ditch\r\nthat encircles it, and you will soon be at the eastern gate. Enter, and\r\na few steps further on you will see before you an open square with fine\r\nelm trees; the convent is there\xe2\x80\x94you cannot mistake it. God be with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d And accompanying his last words with a kind wave of his hand, he\r\nproceeded on his way. Renzo was astonished at the good manners of the\r\ncitizens to countrymen, not knowing that it was an extraordinary day, a\r\nday in which cloaks humbled themselves to doublets. He followed the path\r\nwhich had been pointed out to him, and arrived at the eastern entrance,\r\nwhich consisted of two pilasters, with a roofing above to secure the\r\ngates, and on one side was a small house for the toll-gatherer. The\r\nopenings of the rampart descended irregularly, and their surface was\r\nfilled with rubbish. The street of the suburb which led from this gate\r\nwas not unlike the one which now opens from the Tosa gate. A small ditch\r\nran in the midst of it, until within a few steps of the gate, and\r\ndivided it into two small crooked streets, covered with dust or mud,\r\naccording to the season. At the place where was, and is still, the\r\ncollection of houses called the Borghetto, the ditch empties itself into\r\na common sewer, and thence into another ditch which runs along the\r\nwalls. At this point was a column with a cross on it, dedicated to _San\r\nDionigi_; to the right and left were gardens enclosed by hedges, and at\r\nintervals, small houses inhabited for the most part by washerwomen.\r\nRenzo passed through the gate, without being stopped by the\r\ntoll-gatherer, which appeared to him very remarkable, as he had heard\r\nthose few of his townsmen, who could boast of having been at Milan,\r\nrelate wonderful stories of the strict search and close enquiries to\r\nwhich those were subjected who entered its gates. The street was\r\ndeserted, and if he had not heard the humming of a crowd at a distance,\r\nhe might have thought he was entering a city which had been abandoned by\r\nits inhabitants. As he advanced, he saw on the pavement something\r\nscattered here and there, which was as white as snow, but snow at this\r\nseason it could not be; he touched it, and found that it was flour.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a great plenty in Milan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif they thus throw\r\naway the gifts of God. They give out that famine is every where; this\r\nthey do to keep poor people abroad quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d But in a few moments he\r\narrived in front of the column, and saw on the steps of the pedestal\r\ncertain things scattered, which were not assuredly stones, and which, if\r\nthey had been on a baker\xe2\x80\x99s counter, he would not have hesitated to call\r\nloaves of bread. But Renzo dared not so easily trust his eyes, because\r\ntruly this was not a place for bread. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see what this is,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, and approaching the column, he took one in his hand; it was, indeed,\r\na very white loaf of bread, such as Renzo was accustomed to eat only on\r\nfestival days. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is really bread!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they\r\nscatter it thus here? And in a year like this? And do they suffer it to\r\nlie here, and not take the trouble to gather it? This must be a fine\r\nplace to live in!\xe2\x80\x9d After ten miles of travel, in the fresh air of the\r\nmorning, the sight of the bread awaked his appetite. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he again. \xe2\x80\x9cPoh! they have left it to the dogs; surely, a Christian\r\nmay take advantage of it; and if the owner should come, I can pay him at\r\nany rate.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he put in one pocket that which he had in his\r\nhand, took a second, and put it in the other, and a third, which he\r\nbegan to eat, and resumed his way, full of wonder at the strangeness of\r\nthe incident. As he moved on he saw people approaching from the interior\r\nof the city; and his attention was drawn to those who appeared first; a\r\nman, a woman, and a boy, each with a load which seemed beyond their\r\nstrength, and exhibiting each a grotesque appearance. Their clothes, or\r\nrather their rags, powdered with meal, their faces the same, and\r\nexcessively heated; they walked, not only as if overcome by the weight,\r\nbut as if their limbs had been beaten and bruised. The man supported\r\nwith difficulty a great bag of flour, which having holes here and there,\r\nscattered its contents at every unequal movement. But the figure of the\r\nwoman was still more remarkable: she had her petticoat turned up, filled\r\nwith as much flour as it could hold, and a little more; so that from\r\ntime to time it flew over the pavement. She was, indeed, a grotesque\r\npicture, with her arms stretched out to encompass her burden, and\r\nstaggering under its weight, her bare legs were seen beneath it. The boy\r\nheld with both hands a basket full of bread on his head, but he was\r\ndetained behind his parents to pick up the loaves which were constantly\r\nfalling from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you let another fall, you ugly little dog\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, in a\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t let them fall; they fall of themselves. How can I help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! it\xe2\x80\x99s well for thee that my hands are full,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that we have a little plenty, let us\r\nenjoy it in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had arrived a company of strangers, and one of them\r\naddressed the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we to go for bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOn, on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nshe, and added, muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cThese rascal countrymen will sweep all the\r\nshops and warehouses, and leave none for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a share for every one, chatterer,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband; \xe2\x80\x9cplenty,\r\nplenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom all that Renzo saw and heard, he gathered that there was an\r\ninsurrection in the city, and that each one provided for himself, in\r\nproportion to his will and strength. Although we would desire to make\r\nour poor mountaineer appear to the most advantage, historical truth\r\nobliges us to say that his first sentiment was that of complacency. He\r\nhad so little to rejoice at, in the ordinary course of affairs, that he\r\ncongratulated himself on a change, of whatever nature it might be. And\r\nfor the rest, he, who was not a man superior to the age in which he\r\nlived, held the common opinion that the scarcity of bread had been\r\ncaused by the speculators and bakers, and that any method would be\r\njustifiable, of wresting from them the aliment which they cruelly denied\r\nto the people. However, he determined to keep away from the tumult, and\r\ncongratulated himself on the good fortune of having for his friend a\r\ncapuchin, who would afford him shelter and good advice. Occupied with\r\nsuch reflections, and noticing from time to time as more people came up\r\nloaded with plunder, he proceeded to the convent.\r\n\r\nThe church and convent of the capuchins was situated in the centre of a\r\nsmall square, shaded by elm trees; Renzo placed in his bosom his\r\nremaining half loaf, and with his letter in his hand, approached the\r\ngate and rung the bell. At a small grated window appeared the face of a\r\nfriar, porter to the convent, to ask \xe2\x80\x9cwho was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne from the country, who brings a letter to Father Bonaventura, from\r\nFather Christopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, thrusting his hand through the grate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI must give it into his own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not in the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffer me to enter and wait for him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had best wait in the church,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that may be\r\nof service to you. Into the convent you do not enter at present.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he hastily closed the window, leaving Renzo to receive the\r\nrepulse with the best grace he could. He was about to follow the advice\r\nof the porter, when he was seized with the desire to give a glance at\r\nthe tumult. He crossed the square, and advanced towards the middle of\r\nthe city, where the disturbance was greatest. Whilst he is proceeding\r\nthither, we will relate, as briefly as possible, the causes of this\r\ncommotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the second year of the scarcity; in the preceding one, the\r\nprovisions, remaining from past years, had supplied in some measure the\r\ndeficiency, and we find the population neither altogether satisfied, nor\r\nyet starved; but certainly unprovided for in the year 1628, the period\r\nof our story. Now this harvest, so anxiously desired, was still more\r\ndeficient than that of the past year, partly from the character of the\r\nseason itself (and that not only in the Milanese but also in the\r\nsurrounding country), and partly from the instrumentality of men. The\r\nhavoc of the war, of which we have before made mention, had so\r\ndevastated the state, that a greater number of farms than ordinary\r\nremained uncultivated and deserted by the peasants, who, instead of\r\nproviding, by their labour, bread for their families, were obliged to\r\nbeg it from door to door. We say a greater number of farms than\r\nordinary, because the insupportable taxes, levied with a cupidity and\r\nfolly unequalled; the habitual conduct, even in time of peace, of the\r\nstanding troops (conduct which the mournful documents of the age compare\r\nto that of an invading army), and other causes which we cannot\r\nenumerate, had for some time slowly operated to produce these sad\r\neffects in all the Milanese,\xe2\x80\x94the particular circumstances of which we\r\nnow speak were, therefore, like the unexpected exasperation of a chronic\r\ndisease. Hardly had this harvest been gathered, when the supplies for\r\nthe army, and the waste which always accompanies them, caused an\r\nexcessive scarcity, and with it its painful but profitable concomitant,\r\na high price upon provisions; but this, attaining a certain point,\r\nalways creates in the mind of the multitude a suspicion that scarcity is\r\nnot in reality the cause of it. They forget that they had both feared\r\nand predicted it: they imagine all at once that there must be grain\r\nsufficient, and that the evil lies in an unwillingness to sell it for\r\nconsumption. Preposterous as these suppositions were, they were\r\ngoverned by them, so that the speculators in grain, real or imaginary,\r\nthe farmers, the bakers, became the object of their universal dislike.\r\nThey could tell certainly where there were magazines overflowing with\r\ngrain, and could even enumerate the number of sacks: they spoke with\r\nassurance of the immense quantity of corn which had been despatched to\r\nother places, where probably the people were deluded with a similar\r\nstory, and made to believe that the grain raised among _them_ had been\r\nsent to Milan! They implored from the magistrate those precautions,\r\nwhich always appear equitable and simple to the populace. The\r\nmagistrates complied, and fixed the price on each commodity, threatening\r\npunishment to such as should refuse to sell; notwithstanding this, the\r\nevil continued to increase. This the people attributed to the feebleness\r\nof the remedies, and loudly called for some of a more decided character;\r\nunhappily they found a man that was willing to grant them all they\r\nshould ask.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Governor Don Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, who was\r\nencamped beyond Casale, in Montferrat, the High Chancellor Antonio\r\nFerrer, also a Spaniard, supplied his place in Milan. He considered the\r\nlow price of bread to be in itself desirable, and vainly imagined that\r\nan order from him would be sufficient to accomplish it. He fixed the\r\nlimit, therefore, at the price the bread would have had when corn was\r\nthirty-three livres the bushel; whereas it was now as high as eighty.\r\n\r\nOver the execution of these laws the people themselves watched, and were\r\ndetermined to receive the benefit of them quickly. They assembled in\r\ncrowds before the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 houses to demand bread at the price fixed;\r\nthere was no remedy; the bakers were employed night and day in supplying\r\ntheir wants, inasmuch as the people, having a confused idea that the\r\nprivilege would be transient, ceased not to besiege their houses, in\r\norder to enjoy to the utmost their temporary good fortune. The\r\nmagistrates threatened punishment\xe2\x80\x94the multitude murmured at every delay\r\nof the bakers in furnishing them. These remonstrated incessantly against\r\nthe iniquitous and insupportable weight of the burden imposed on them;\r\nbut Antonio Ferrer replied, that they had possessed great advantages in\r\ntimes past, and now owed the public some reparation. Finally, the\r\ncouncil of ten (a municipal magistracy composed of nobles, which lasted\r\nuntil the ninety-seventh year of the century just elapsed,) informed the\r\ngovernor of the state in which things were, hoping that he would find\r\nsome remedy. Don Gonzalo, immersed in the business of war, named a\r\ncouncil, upon whom he conferred authority to fix a reasonable price upon\r\nbread, so that both parties should be satisfied. The deputies assembled,\r\nand after much deliberation felt themselves compelled to augment the\r\nprice of it: the bakers breathed, but the people became furious.\r\n\r\nThe evening preceding the day on which Renzo arrived at Milan, the\r\nstreets swarmed with people, who, governed by one common feeling,\r\nstrangers or friends, had intuitively united themselves in companies\r\nthroughout the city. Every observation tended to increase their rage and\r\ntheir resentment; various opinions were given, and many exclamations\r\nuttered; here, one declaimed aloud to a circle of bystanders, who\r\napplauded vehemently; there, another more cautious, but not less\r\ndangerous, was whispering in the ear of a neighbour or two, that\r\nsomething must and would be done: in short, there was an incessant and\r\ndiscordant din from the medley of men, women, and children, which\r\ncomposed the various assemblages. There was now only required an impetus\r\nto set the machine in motion, and reduce words to deeds; and an\r\nopportunity soon presented itself. At the break of day little boys were\r\nseen issuing from the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 shops with baskets on their heads, loaded\r\nwith bread, which they were about to carry to their usual customers. The\r\nappearance of one of these unlucky boys in an assembly of people was\r\nlike a squib thrown into a gunpowder mill. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is bread!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a\r\nhundred voices at once. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, for our tyrants, who swim in abundance,\r\nand wish to make us die in hunger,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, who drew near the boy, and\r\nseizing the basket, cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy coloured, grew\r\npale, trembled, and would have entreated them to let him pass on, but\r\nthe words died on his lips; he then endeavoured to free himself from the\r\nbasket. \xe2\x80\x9cDown with the basket\xe2\x80\x9d was heard on all sides; it was seized by\r\nmany hands, and placed on the earth: they raised the napkin which\r\ncovered it, and a tepid fragrance diffused itself around. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nChristians also,\xe2\x80\x9d said one; \xe2\x80\x9cand have a right to eat bread as well as\r\nother people:\xe2\x80\x9d so saying, he took a loaf and bit it; the rest followed\r\nhis example; and it is unnecessary to add, that in a few moments the\r\ncontents of the basket had disappeared. Those who had not been able to\r\nsecure any for themselves were irritated at the sight of their\r\nneighbours\xe2\x80\x99 gains, and animated by the facility of the enterprise, went\r\nin search of other boys with baskets; as many, therefore, as they met\r\nwere stopped and plundered. Still the number who remained unsatisfied\r\nwas beyond comparison the greatest, and even the gainers were only\r\nstimulated by their success to ampler enterprises; so that\r\nsimultaneously there was a shout from the crowd of \xe2\x80\x9cTo the bake-house!\r\nto the bake-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the street called the _Corsia de\xe2\x80\x99 Servi_ there was, and is still, a\r\nbakery of the same name,\xe2\x80\x94a name that signifies in Tuscan the _Shop of\r\nthe Crutches_, and in Milanese is composed of such barbarous words, that\r\nit is impossible to discover their sound from any rule of the\r\nlanguage.[4] To this place the throng approached: the shopkeepers were\r\nlistening to the sad relation of the boys, who had but just escaped with\r\ntheir lives, when they heard a distant murmur, and beheld the crowd\r\nadvancing.\r\n\r\n      [4] El prestin di scansc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut, shut! quick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d some ran to ask aid from the sheriff; others\r\nin haste closed the shop, and barricadoed and secured the doors from\r\nwithin. The throng thickened in front, and cries of \xe2\x80\x9cBread, bread! open,\r\nopen!\xe2\x80\x9d were heard from every quarter. The sheriff arrived with a troop\r\nof halberdiers. \xe2\x80\x9cMake way, make way, friends! home, home! make way for\r\nthe sheriff,\xe2\x80\x9d cried they. The people gave way a little, so that they\r\ncould draw themselves up in front of the door of the shop. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nfriends,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sheriff from this place, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you do here? Home,\r\nhome! have you no fear of God? What will our lord the king say? We do\r\nnot wish you harm; but go home. There is no good to be gained here for\r\nsoul or body. Home, home!\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd, regardless of his expostulations,\r\npressed forward, themselves being urged on by increasing multitudes\r\nbehind. \xe2\x80\x9cMake them draw back, that I may recover breath,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he\r\nto the halberdiers, \xe2\x80\x9cbut harm no one\xe2\x80\x94we will endeavour to get into the\r\nshop\xe2\x80\x94make them keep back, and knock at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBack, back,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe halberdiers, presenting the but-ends of their arms; the throng\r\nretreated a little; the sheriff knocked, crying to those within to open;\r\nthey obeyed, and he and his guard contrived to intrench themselves\r\nwithin the house; then, appearing at a window above, \xe2\x80\x9cFriends,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cgo home. A general pardon to whoever shall return immediately to\r\ntheir houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBread, bread! open, open!\xe2\x80\x9d vociferated the crowd in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have justice, friends; but return to your houses. You shall\r\nhave bread; but this is not the way to obtain it. Eh! what are you doing\r\nbelow there? At the door of the house! hah! hah! Take care; it is a\r\ncriminal act. Eh! away with those tools! take down those hands! hah!\r\nhah! You Milanese, who are famous throughout the world for your\r\nbenevolence, who have always been accounted good citi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Ah! rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis rapid change of style was occasioned by a stone thrown by one of\r\nthese good citizens at the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cRascals! rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nhe, closing the window in a rage. The confusion below increased; stones\r\nwere thrown at the doors and windows, and they had nearly opened a way\r\ninto the shop. Meanwhile the master and boys of the shop, who were at\r\nthe windows of the story above, with a supply of stones (obtained\r\nprobably from the court-yard), threatened to throw them upon the crowd\r\nif they did not disperse. Perceiving their threats to be of no avail,\r\nthey commenced putting them in execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! villains! ah! rogues! Is this the bread you give to the poor?\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nscreamed from below. Many were wounded, two were killed; the fury of the\r\nmultitude increased; the doors were broken open, and the torrent rushed\r\nthrough all the passages. At this, those within took refuge under the\r\nshop floor; the sheriff and the halberdiers hid themselves beneath the\r\ntiles; others escaped by the skylights, and wandered upon the roofs like\r\ncats.\r\n\r\nThe sight of their prey made the conquerors forget their designs of\r\nsanguinary vengeance; some rushed to the chests, and plundered them of\r\nbread; others hastened to force the locks of the counter, and took from\r\nthence handfulls of money, which they pocketed, and then returned to\r\ntake more bread, if there should remain any. Others, again, entered the\r\ninterior magazines, and, throwing out part of the flour, reduced the\r\nbags to a portable size; some attacked a kneading trough, and made a\r\nbooty of the dough; a few had made a prize of a bolting cloth, which\r\nthey raised in the air as in triumph, and, in addition to all, men,\r\nwomen, and children were covered with a cloud of white powder.\r\n\r\nWhile this shop was so ransacked, none of the others in the city\r\nremained quiet, or free from danger. But at none had the people\r\nassembled in such numbers as to be very daring; in some, the owners had\r\nprovided auxiliaries, and were on the defensive; in others, the owners\r\nless strong in numbers, and more affrighted, endeavoured to compromise\r\nmatters; they distributed bread to those who crowded around their shops,\r\nand thus got rid of them. And these did not depart so much because they\r\nwere content with the acquisition, as from fear of the halberdiers and\r\nofficers of justice, who were now scattered throughout the city, in\r\ncompanies sufficient to keep these little bands of mutineers in\r\nsubjection. In the mean time the tumult and the crowd increased in front\r\nof the unfortunate bakery, as the strength of the populace had here the\r\nadvantage. Things were in this situation, when Renzo, coming from the\r\neastern gate, approached, without knowing it, the scene of tumult.\r\nHurried along by the crowd, he endeavoured to extract from the confused\r\nshouting of the throng some more positive information of the real state\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the infamous imposition of these rascals is discovered,\xe2\x80\x9d said one;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey said there was neither bread, flour, nor corn. Now we know things\r\njust as they are, and they can no longer deceive us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you that all this answers no purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said another; \xe2\x80\x9cit will\r\ndo no good unless justice be done to us. Bread will be cheap enough,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis true, but they will put poison in it to make the poor die like\r\nflies. They have already said we are too numerous, I know they have; I\r\nheard it from one of my acquaintances, who is a friend of a relation of\r\na scullion of one of the lords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake way, make way, gentlemen, I beseech you; make way for a poor\r\nfather of a family who is carrying bread to five children!\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nsaid by one who came staggering under the weight of a bag of flour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, in an under tone, to one of his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing away. I am a man of the world, and I know how these things go.\r\nThese clowns, who now make so much noise, will prove themselves cowards\r\nto-morrow. I have already perceived some among the crowd who are taking\r\nnote of those who are present, and when all is over, they will make up\r\nthe account, and the guilty will pay the penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who protects the bakers,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a sonorous voice, which attracted\r\nthe attention of Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cis the superintendent of provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all rogues,\xe2\x80\x9d said a neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he is the chief,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the one who had first spoken.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of provisions, elected every year by the governor\r\nfrom a list of seven nobles formed from the council of ten, was the\r\npresident of the court of provision, which, composed of twelve nobles,\r\nhad, with other duties, that of superintending the corn for the\r\ncitizens. Persons in such a station would naturally, in times of\r\nstarvation and ignorance, be considered as the authors of all the evil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheats!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed another; \xe2\x80\x9ccan they do worse? They have had the\r\naudacity to say that the high chancellor is a childish old man, and they\r\nwish to take the government into their own hands. We ought to make a\r\ngreat coop, and put them in, to feed upon dry peas and cockleweed, as\r\nthey would fain have us do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile listening to such observations as the above, Renzo continued to\r\nmake his way through the crowd, and at last arrived in front of the\r\nbakery. On viewing its dilapidated and ruinous state, after the assault\r\njust sustained, \xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot be a good deed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he: \xe2\x80\x9cif they treat\r\nall the bake-houses in this manner, where will they make bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, some were seen issuing from the house, loaded with\r\npieces of chests, or troughs, or a bench, basket, or some other relic of\r\nthe poor building, and crying, \xe2\x80\x9cMake way, make way!\xe2\x80\x9d passed through the\r\ncrowd. These were all carried in the same direction, and it appeared to\r\na place agreed upon. Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity being excited, he followed one\r\nwho carried a bundle of pieces of board and chips on his shoulder, and\r\nfound that he took the direction of the cathedral. On passing it, the\r\nmountaineer could not avoid stopping a moment to gaze with admiring eyes\r\non the magnificent structure. He then quickened his steps to rejoin him\r\nwhom he had taken as a guide, and, keeping behind him, they drew near\r\nthe middle of the square. The crowd was here more dense, but they opened\r\na way for the carrier, and Renzo, skilfully introducing himself in the\r\nvoid left by him, arrived with him in the very midst of the multitude.\r\nHere there was an open space, in the centre of which was a bonfire, a\r\nheap of embers, the remains of the tools mentioned above; surrounding it\r\nwas heard a clapping of hands and stamping of feet, the tumult of a\r\nthousand cries of triumph and imprecation.\r\n\r\nHe of the boards threw them on the embers, and some, with pieces of\r\nhalf-burnt shovel, stirred them until the flame ascended, upon which\r\ntheir shouts were renewed louder than before. The flame sank again, and\r\nthe company, for want of more combustibles, began to be weary, when a\r\nreport spread, that at the Cordusio (a square or cross-way not far from\r\nthere) they were besieging a bakery: then was heard on all sides, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus go, let us go;\xe2\x80\x9d and the crowd moved on. Renzo was drawn along with\r\nthe current, but in the mean while held counsel with himself, whether he\r\nhad not best withdraw from the fray, and return to the convent in search\r\nof Father Bonaventura; but curiosity again prevailed, and he suffered\r\nhimself to be carried forward, with the determination, however, of\r\nremaining a mere spectator of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe multitude passed through the short and narrow street of Pescheria,\r\nand thence by the crooked arch to the square de\xe2\x80\x99 Mercanti. Here there\r\nwere very few, who, in passing before the niche that divides towards the\r\ncentre the terrace of the edifice then called the College of Doctors,\r\ndid not give a slight glance at the great statue contained in it of\r\nPhilip II., who even from the marble imposed respect, and who, with his\r\narm extended, appeared to be menacing the populace for their rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis niche is now empty, and from a singular circumstance. About one\r\nhundred and sixty years after the events we are now relating, the head\r\nof the statue was changed, the sceptre taken from its hand, and a dagger\r\nsubstituted in its place, and beneath it was written _Marcus Brutus_.\r\nThus inserted it remained perhaps a couple of years, until one day, some\r\npersons, who had no sympathies with Marcus Brutus, but rather an\r\naversion to him, threw a rope around the statue, pulled it down, and,\r\nreducing it to a shapeless mass, dragged it, with many insulting\r\ngestures, beyond the walls of the city. Who would have foretold this to\r\nAndrea Biffi when he sculptured it?\r\n\r\nFrom the square de\xe2\x80\x99 Mercanti, the clamorous troop at length arrived at\r\nthe Cordusio. Each one immediately looked towards the shop; but, instead\r\nof the crowd of friends which they expected to find engaged on its\r\ndemolition, there were but a few, at a distance from the shop, which was\r\nshut, and defended from the windows by armed people. They fell back, and\r\nthere was a murmur through the crowd of unwillingness to risk the hazard\r\nof proceeding, when a voice was heard to cry aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cNear by is the\r\nhouse of the superintendent of provision; let us do justice, and plunder\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a universal acceptance of the proposal, and \xe2\x80\x9cTo the\r\nsuperintendent\xe2\x80\x99s! to the superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d was the only sound that\r\ncould be heard. The crowd moved with unanimous fury towards the street\r\nwhere the house, named in such an evil moment, was situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate superintendent was at this moment painfully digesting\r\nhis miserable dinner, whilst awaiting anxiously the termination of this\r\nhurricane; he was, however, far from suspecting that its greatest fury\r\nwas to be spent on himself. Some benevolent persons hastened forward to\r\ninform him of his urgent peril. The servants, drawn to the door by the\r\nuproar, beheld, in affright, the dense mass advancing. While they\r\nlistened to the friendly notice, the vanguard appeared; one hastily\r\ninformed his master; and while he, for a moment, deliberated upon\r\nflight, another came to say there was no longer time for it; in hurry\r\nand confusion they closed and barricadoed the windows and the doors. The\r\nhowling without increased; each corner of the house resounded with it;\r\nand in the midst of the vast and mingled noise was heard, fearfully and\r\ndistinctly, the blows of stones upon the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tyrant! the tyrant!\r\nthe causer of famine! we must have him, living or dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor man wandered from room to room in a state of insupportable\r\nalarm, commending himself to God, and beseeching his servants to be\r\nfirm, and to find for him some way of escape! He ascended to the highest\r\nfloor, and, from an opening between the garret and the roof, he looked\r\nanxiously out upon the street, and beheld it filled with the enraged\r\npopulace; more appalled than ever, he withdrew to seek the most secure\r\nand secret hiding-place. Here, concealed, he listened intently to\r\nascertain if at any time the importunate transport of passion should\r\nweaken, if the tumult should in any degree subside; but his heart died\r\nwithin him to hear the uproar continue with aggravated and savage\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\nRenzo at this time found himself in the thickest of the confusion, not\r\nnow carried there by the press, but by his own inclination. At the first\r\nproposal of blood-shedding, he felt his own curdle in his veins; as to\r\nthe plundering, he was not quite certain whether it was right or wrong;\r\nbut the idea of murder caused him unmixed horror. And although he was\r\ngreatly persuaded that the vicar was the primary cause of the famine,\r\nthe grand criminal, still, having, at the first movement of the crowd,\r\nheard, by chance, some expressions which indicated a willingness to make\r\nany effort to save him, he had suddenly determined to aid such a work,\r\nand had therefore pressed near the door, which was assailed in a\r\nthousand ways. Some were pounding the lock to break it in pieces; others\r\nassisted with stakes, and chisels, and hammers; others, again, tore away\r\nthe plastering, and beat in pieces the wall, in order to effect a\r\nbreach. The rest, who were unable to get near the house, encouraged by\r\ntheir shouts those who were at the work of destruction; though,\r\nfortunately, through the eagerness with which they pressed forward, they\r\nimpeded its progress.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates, who were the first to have notice of the fray,\r\ndespatched a messenger to ask military aid of the commander of the\r\ncastle, which was then called, from the gate, Giovia; and he forthwith\r\ndetached a troop, which arrived when the house was encompassed with the\r\nthrong, and undergoing its tremendous assault; and was therefore obliged\r\nto halt at a distance from it, and at the extremity of the crowd. The\r\nofficer who commanded it did not know what course to pursue; at the\r\norder to disperse and make way, the people replied by a deep and\r\ncontinued murmur, but no one moved. To fire on the crowd appeared not\r\nonly savage, but perilous, inasmuch as the most harmless might be\r\ninjured, and the most ferocious only irritated, and prepared for further\r\nmischief; and moreover his instructions did not authorise it. To break\r\nthe crowd, and go forward with his band to the house, would have been\r\nthe best, if success could have been certain; but who could tell if the\r\nsoldiers could proceed united and in order? The irresolution of the\r\ncommander seemed to proceed from fear: the populace were unmoved by the\r\nappearance of the soldiers, and continued their attacks on the house. At\r\na little distance there stood an ill-looking, half-starved old man, who,\r\ncontracting an angry countenance to a smile of diabolical complacency,\r\nbrandished above his hoary head a hammer, with which he said he meant to\r\nnail the vicar to the posts of his door, alive as he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shame! shame!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cShame! would you take the\r\nhangman\xe2\x80\x99s business out of his hand? to assassinate a Christian? How can\r\nyou expect God will give us bread, if we commit such iniquity? He will\r\nsend us his thunders, and not bread!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! dog! ah! traitor to the country!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one who had heard these\r\nwords, turning to Renzo with the countenance of a demon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nservant of the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s disguised like a countryman; it is a spy!\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nhundred voices were heard exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nservant of the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a spy\xe2\x80\x94the vicar himself, escaping in the\r\ndisguise of a peasant!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo would have shrunk into nothingness,\xe2\x80\x94some of the more benevolent\r\ncontrived to help him to disappear through the crowd; but that which\r\npreserved him most effectually was a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cMake way, here comes our\r\nhelp, make way!\xe2\x80\x9d which attracted the attention of the throng.\r\n\r\nThis was a long scaling ladder, supported by a few persons who were\r\nendeavouring to penetrate the living mass, and by which they meant to\r\ngain entrance to the house. But, happily, this was not easy of\r\nexecution; the length of the machine precluded the possibility of its\r\nbeing carried easily through such a multitude; it came, however, just in\r\ntime for Renzo, who profited by the confusion, and escaped to a\r\ndistance, with the intention of making his way, as soon as he could, to\r\nthe convent, in search of Father Bonaventura.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a new movement began at one extremity, and diffused itself\r\nthrough the crowd:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFerrer, Ferrer!\xe2\x80\x9d resounded from every side. Some\r\nwere surprised, some rejoiced, some were exasperated, some applauded,\r\nsome affirmed, some denied, some blessed, some cursed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here? It is not true; it is not true. Yes, yes, long live Ferrer,\r\nhe who makes bread cheap.\xe2\x80\x94No, no! He is here\xe2\x80\x94here in a carriage! Why\r\ndoes he come?\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t want him.\xe2\x80\x94Ferrer! long live Ferrer! the friend\r\nof the poor! he comes to take the vicar prisoner.\xe2\x80\x94No, no, we would\r\nrevenge _ourselves_, we would fight our own battles; back, back.\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\r\nyes, Ferrer! Let him come! to prison with the vicar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the crowd, on the side opposite to that where the\r\nsoldiers were, Antonio Ferrer, the high chancellor, was approaching in\r\nhis carriage, who, probably condemning himself as the cause of this\r\ncommotion, had come to avert at least its most terrific and irreparable\r\neffects, to spend worthily a popularity unworthily acquired.\r\n\r\nIn popular tumults there are always some who, from heated passion, or\r\nfanaticism, or wicked design, do what they can to push things to the\r\nworst; proposing and promoting the most barbarous counsels, and\r\nassisting to stir the fire whenever it appears to slacken. But, on the\r\nother hand, there are always those who, perhaps with equal ardour, and\r\nequal perseverance, employ their efforts for the production of contrary\r\neffects; some led by friendship or partiality for the persons in danger,\r\nothers without other impulse than that of horror of bloodshed and\r\natrocity. The mass, then, is ever composed of a mixed assemblage, who,\r\nby indefinite gradations, hold to one or the other extreme; prompt to\r\nrage or compassion, to adoration or execration, according as the\r\noccasion presents itself for the developement of either of these\r\nsentiments: _life_ and _death_ are the words involuntarily uttered, and\r\nwith equal facility; and he who succeeds in persuading them that such an\r\none does not deserve to be quartered, has but little more to do, to\r\nconvince them that he ought to be carried in triumph.\r\n\r\nWhile these various interests were contending for superiority in the\r\nmob, before the house of the vicar, the appearance of Antonio Ferrer\r\ngave instantly a great advantage to the humane, who were manifestly\r\nyielding to the greater strength of the ferocious and blood-thirsty. The\r\nman himself was acceptable to the multitude, from his having previously\r\nfavoured their cause, and from his heroic resistance to any arguments\r\nagainst it. Those already favourably inclined towards him were now much\r\nmore affected by the courageous confidence of an old man, who, without\r\nguards or retinue, came thus to confront an angry and stormy multitude.\r\nThe announcement that his purpose was to take the vicar prisoner,\r\nproduced at once a wonderful effect; and the fury against that unhappy\r\nperson, which would have been aggravated by any attempt at defiance, or\r\nrefusal of concession, now, with the promise of satisfaction, and, to\r\nspeak in the Milanese fashion, with this bone in the mouth, became in a\r\ndegree appeased, and gave place to other opposite sentiments, which\r\nbegan to prevail over their minds.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of peace, having recovered breath, aided Ferrer in various\r\nways; those who were near him, while endeavouring by their own to\r\nperpetuate the general applause, sought at the same time to keep off the\r\ncrowd, so as to open a passage for the carriage; others applauded and\r\nrepeated his words, or such as appeared appropriate to his undertaking\r\nand his peril; imposed silence on the obstinately furious, or contrived\r\nto turn against _them_ the anger of the fickle assembly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it that\r\nwill not say, Long live Ferrer? You don\xe2\x80\x99t wish bread to be cheap, then,\r\neh? They are rogues who are not willing to receive justice at the hands\r\nof a Christian, and there are some among them who cry louder than the\r\nrest, to allow the vicar to escape. To prison with the superintendent!\r\nLong live Ferrer! Make way for Ferrer!\xe2\x80\x9d The numbers of those who spoke\r\nin this manner increasing continually, the numbers of the opposite party\r\ndiminished in proportion; so that the former, from admonishing, had\r\nrecourse to blows, in order to silence those who were still disposed to\r\npursue the work of destruction. The menaces and threatenings of the\r\nweaker party were of no longer avail; the cause of blood had ceased to\r\npredominate, and in its place were heard only the cries of \xe2\x80\x9cPrison,\r\njustice, Ferrer!\xe2\x80\x9d The rebellious spirits were finally silenced: the\r\nremainder took possession of the door, in order to defend it from fresh\r\nattacks, and also to prepare a passage for Ferrer; and some among them\r\ncalled to those within (openings were not wanting) that succour had\r\narrived, and that the vicar must get ready \xe2\x80\x9cto go quickly\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nprison\xe2\x80\x94hem! do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Ferrer who helps in making the proclamations?\xe2\x80\x9d asked our\r\nRenzo of one of his new neighbours, remembering the _vidit Ferrera_ that\r\nthe doctor had shown him appended to the famous proclamation, and which\r\nhe had reiterated in his ears with so great a degree of pertinacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, the high chancellor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a worthy man, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is more than worthy; it is he who has lowered the price of bread,\r\nagainst the wishes of others in power, and now he comes to carry the\r\nvicar to prison, because he has not acted justly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say, that Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were immediately\r\nenlisted on the side of Ferrer. He was desirous to approach near him,\r\nbut the undertaking was no easy one; however, with the decision and\r\nstrength of a mountaineer, he continued to elbow himself through the\r\ncrowd, and finally reached the side of the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe carriage had already penetrated into the midst of the crowd, but was\r\nhere suddenly stopped by one of those obstructions, the unavoidable\r\nconsequence of a journey like this. The aged Ferrer presented, now at\r\none window of his carriage, now at the other, a countenance full of\r\nhumility, of sweetness, and benevolence; a countenance which he had\r\nalways kept in reserve for the day in which he should appear before Don\r\nPhilip IV.; but he was constrained to make use of it on this occasion.\r\nHe spoke; but the noise and buzzing of so many voices, and the shouts of\r\napplause which they bestowed on him, allowed but little of his discourse\r\nto be heard. He had recourse also to gestures; now placing his fingers\r\non his lips, to take from thence a kiss, which his enclosed hands\r\ndistributed to right and left, as if to render thanks for the favour\r\nwith which the public regarded him; then he extended them, waving them\r\nslowly beyond the window as if to entreat a little space; and now again\r\nlowering them politely, as if to request a little silence. When he had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining, in some measure, his last request, those who\r\nwere nearest to him heard and repeated his words:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBread, abundance. I\r\ncome to do justice; a little space, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as if stifled\r\nand suffocated with the press, and the continual buzzing of so many\r\nvoices, he threw himself back in the carriage, and with difficulty\r\ndrawing a long breath, said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9c_Por mi vida, que de\r\ngente_.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\n      [5]: Upon my life, what a multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live Ferrer; there is no occasion for fear; you are a brave man.\r\nBread! bread!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, bread, bread,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ferrer, \xe2\x80\x9cin abundance! _I_ promise you, I\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d placing his hand on his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cClear a passage for me,\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\r\nthen, in the loudest voice he could command; \xe2\x80\x9cI come to carry him to\r\nprison, to inflict on him a just punishment;\xe2\x80\x9d and he added, in a very\r\nlow tone, \xe2\x80\x9c_Si esta culpable_.\xe2\x80\x9d[6] Then leaning forward to the coachman,\r\nhe said hastily, \xe2\x80\x9c_Adelante, Pedro, si puedes_.\xe2\x80\x9d[7]\r\n\r\n      [6] If he is guilty.\r\n\r\n      [7] Go on, Pedro, if you can.\r\n\r\nThe coachman smiled also on the people with an affected politeness, as\r\nif he were some great personage; and, with ineffable grace, he waved the\r\nwhip slowly from right to left, as if requesting his inconvenient\r\nneighbours to retire a little on either side. \xe2\x80\x9cBe so kind, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9ca little space, ever so little, just enough to let us pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the most active and officious employed themselves in preparing\r\nthe passage so politely requested. Some made the crowd retire from\r\nbefore the horses with good words, placing their hands on their breast,\r\nand pushing them gently, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, a little space, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOthers pursued the same plan at the sides of the carriage, so that it\r\nmight pass on without damage to those who surrounded it; which would\r\nhave subjected the popularity of Antonio Ferrer to great hazard. Renzo,\r\nafter having been occupied for a few moments in admiring the respectable\r\nold man, a little disturbed by vexation, overwhelmed with fatigue, but\r\nanimated by solicitude, embellished, so to speak, by the hope of\r\nwresting a fellow-creature from the pains of death,\xe2\x80\x94Renzo, I say, threw\r\naway all idea of retreat. He resolved to assist Ferrer in every way that\r\nlay in his power, and not to abandon him until he had accomplished his\r\ndesigns. He united with the others to free the way, and he was certainly\r\nnot one of the least active or industrious. A passage was opened. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d said a number of them to the coachman, retiring in front\r\nof the crowd to maintain the passage clear. \xe2\x80\x9c_Adelante, presto, con\r\njuicio_[8],\xe2\x80\x9d said his master also to him, and the carriage moved\r\nforward. In the midst of the salutes which he lavished promiscuously on\r\nthe public, Ferrer, with a smile of intelligence, bestowed particular\r\nthanks upon those whom he beheld busily employed for him; more than one\r\nof these smiles was directed to Renzo, who, in truth, deserved them\r\nrichly, serving the high chancellor on this day with more devoted zeal\r\nthan the most intrepid of his secretaries. The young mountaineer was\r\ndelighted with his condescension, and proud of the honour of having, as\r\nhe thought, formed a friendship with Antonio Ferrer.\r\n\r\n      [8] On, on, but be careful.\r\n\r\nThe carriage, once in motion, continued its way with more or less\r\nslowness, and not without being frequently brought to a full stop. The\r\nspace to be traversed was short, but, with respect to the time it\r\noccupied, it would have appeared interminable, even to one not governed\r\nby the holy motive of Ferrer. The people thronged around the carriage,\r\nto right and left, as dolphins around a vessel, hurried forward by a\r\ntempest. The noise was more piercing and discordant than that of a\r\ntempest itself. Ferrer continued to speak to the populace the whole\r\nlength of the way. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, gentlemen, bread in abundance. I will conduct\r\nhim to prison; he shall be punished\xe2\x80\x94_si esta culpable_.[9] Yes, yes, I\r\nwill order it so; bread shall be cheap. _Asi es._ So it shall, I mean.\r\nThe king our master does not wish his faithful subjects to suffer from\r\nhunger. _Oh, oh! guardaos._[10] Take care that we do not hurt you,\r\ngentlemen, _Pedro, adelante, con juicio._[11] Abundance! abundance! a\r\nlittle space, for the love of Heaven! Bread, bread! To prison! to\r\nprison! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded he of a man who had thrust himself\r\npartly within the window to howl at him some advice, or petition, or\r\napplause, no matter what; but he, without having heard the question, had\r\nbeen drawn back by another, who saw him in danger of being crushed by\r\nthe wheel. Amidst all this clamour, Ferrer at last gained the house,\r\nthanks to his kind auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n      [9] If he is guilty.\r\n\r\n      [10] Oh, oh! take care.\r\n\r\n      [11] On, Pedro, but be careful.\r\n\r\nThose who had stationed themselves there had equally laboured to procure\r\nthe desired result, and had succeeded in dividing the crowd in two, and\r\nkeeping them back, so that between the door and the carriage there\r\nshould be an empty space, however small. Renzo, who in acting as a scout\r\nand a guide had arrived with the carriage, was able to find a place,\r\nwhence he could, by making a rampart of his powerful shoulders, see\r\ndistinctly all that passed.\r\n\r\nFerrer breathed again on seeing the place free, and the door still shut,\r\nor, to speak more correctly, not yet open. However, the hinges were\r\nnearly torn from their fastenings, and the panels shivered in many\r\npieces; so that an opening was made, through which it could be seen that\r\nwhat held it together was the bolt, which, however, was almost twisted\r\nfrom its socket. Through this breach some one cried to those within to\r\nopen the door, another ran to let down the steps of the carriage, and\r\nthe old man descended from it, leaning on the arm of this benevolent\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe crowd pressed forward to behold him: curiosity and general attention\r\ncaused a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence. Ferrer stopped an instant on the steps,\r\nturned towards them, and putting his hand to his heart, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBread and\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x9d Clothed in his toga, with head erect, and step assured, he\r\ncontinued to descend, amid the loud applause that rent the skies.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the people of the house had opened the door, so as to\r\npermit the entrance of so desired a guest; taking care, however, to\r\ncontract the opening to the space his body would occupy. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9copen, so that I may enter; and you, brave men, keep back the\r\npeople, do not let them come behind me\xe2\x80\x94for the love of Heaven! Open a\r\nway for us, presently.\xe2\x80\x94Eh! eh! gentlemen, one moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the\r\npeople of the house; \xe2\x80\x9csoftly with this door; let me pass. Oh, my ribs,\r\ntake care of my ribs. Shut now\xe2\x80\x94no, my gown, my gown!\xe2\x80\x9d It would have\r\nremained caught within the door if Ferrer had not hastily withdrawn it.\r\n\r\nThe doors, closed in the best manner they could be, were nevertheless\r\nsupported with bars from within. On the outside, those who had\r\nconstituted themselves the bodyguard of Ferrer worked with their\r\nshoulders, their arms, and their voice to keep the place empty, praying\r\nfrom the bottom of their hearts that they would be expeditious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferrer, as he reached the portico, to the servants\r\nwho surrounded him, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay your excellency be rewarded! What\r\ngoodness! Great God, what goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, quick,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ferrer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is this poor man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe superintendent descended the stairs half led, half carried by his\r\ndomestics, and pale as death. When he saw who had come to his\r\nassistance, he sighed deeply, his pulse returned, and a slight colour\r\ntinged his cheek. He hastened to meet Ferrer, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI am in the hands\r\nof God and your excellency; but how go hence? we are surrounded on all\r\nsides by people who desire my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Venga con migo usted_[12], and take courage. My carriage is at the\r\ndoor; quick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d He took him by the hand, and, continuing to\r\nencourage him, led him towards the door, saying in his heart, however,\r\n_Aqui esta el busilis! Dios nos valga!_[13]\r\n\r\n      [12] Come with me.\r\n\r\n      [13] Now for the difficult point! God help us!\r\n\r\nThe door, opened; Ferrer appeared first; the superintendent followed,\r\nshrinking with fear, and clinging to the protecting toga, as an infant\r\nto the gown of its mother. Those who had maintained the space free\r\nraised their hands and waved their hats; making in this manner a sort of\r\ncloud to conceal the superintendent from the view of the people, and to\r\nenable him to enter the carriage, and place himself out of sight. Ferrer\r\nfollowed, and the carriage was closed. The people drew their own\r\nconclusions as to what had taken place, and there arose, in consequence,\r\na mingled sound of applauses and imprecations.\r\n\r\nThe return of the carriage might seem to be even more difficult and\r\ndangerous; but the willingness of the public to suffer the\r\nsuperintendent to be carried to prison was sufficiently manifest; and\r\nthe friends of Ferrer had been busy in keeping the way open whilst he\r\nwas at the house, so that he could return with a little more speed than\r\nhe went. As it advanced, the crowd, ranged on either side, closed and\r\nunited their ranks behind it.\r\n\r\nFerrer, as soon as he was seated, whispered the superintendent to keep\r\nhimself concealed in the bottom of the carriage, and not to let himself\r\nbe seen, for the love of Heaven; there was, however, no need of this\r\nadvice. It was the policy of the high chancellor, on the contrary, to\r\nattract as much of the attention of the populace as possible, and during\r\nall this passage, as in the former, he harangued his changeable auditory\r\nwith a great quantity of sound, and very little sense; interrupting\r\nhimself continually to breathe into the ear of his invisible companion a\r\nfew hurried words of Spanish. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, gentlemen, bread and justice. To the\r\ncastle, to prison under my care. Thanks, thanks, a thousand thanks! No,\r\nno, he shall not escape! _Por ablanderlos._[14] It is too just, we will\r\nexamine, we will see. I wish you well. A severe punishment. _Esto lo\r\ndigo por su bien._[15] A just and moderate price, and punishment to\r\nthose who oppose it. Keep off a little, I pray you. Yes, yes; I am the\r\nfriend of the people. He shall be punished; it is true; he is a villain,\r\na rascal. _Perdone usted._[16] He shall be punished, he shall be\r\npunished\xe2\x80\x94_si esta culpable_.[17] Yes, yes; we will make the bakers do\r\nthat which is just. Long live the king! long live the good Milanese, his\r\nfaithful subjects! _Animo estamos ya quasi afuera._\xe2\x80\x9d[18]\r\n\r\n      [14] It is to coax them.\r\n\r\n      [15] I say that for your good.\r\n\r\n      [16] Pardon me.\r\n\r\n      [17] If he is guilty.\r\n\r\n      [18] Courage, we are almost out of danger.\r\n\r\nThey had, in fact, passed through the thickest of the throng, and were\r\nrapidly advancing to a place of safety; and now Ferrer gave his lungs a\r\nlittle repose, and looking forward, beheld the succours from Pisa, those\r\nSpanish soldiers, who had at last rendered themselves of service, by\r\npersuading some of the people to retire to their homes, and by keeping\r\nthe passage free for the final escape. Upon the arrival of the carriage,\r\nthey made room, and presented arms to the high chancellor, who bowed to\r\nright and left; and to the officer who approached the nearest to salute\r\nhim he said, accompanying his words with a wave of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9c_Beso \xc3\xa0\r\nusted las manos_[19],\xe2\x80\x9d which the officer interpreted to signify, You\r\nhave given me much assistance!\r\n\r\n      [19] I kiss your hands.\r\n\r\nHe might have appropriately added, _Cedant arma tog\xc3\xa6_; but the\r\nimagination of Ferrer was not at this moment at liberty to occupy itself\r\nwith quotations, and, moreover, they would have been addressed to the\r\nwind, as the officer did not understand Latin.\r\n\r\nPedro felt his accustomed courage revive at the sight of these files of\r\nmuskets, so respectfully raised; and recovering entirely from his\r\namazement, he urged on his horses, without deigning to take further\r\nnotice of the few, who were now harmless from their numbers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Levantese, levantese, estamos afueras_[20],\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferrer to the\r\nsuperintendent, who, re-assured by the cessation of the tumult, the\r\nrapid motion of the carriage, and these words of encouragement, drew\r\nhimself from his corner, and overwhelmed his liberator with thanks. The\r\nlatter, after having condoled with him on account of his peril, and\r\nrejoiced at his deliverance, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ah! que dira de esto su\r\nexcelencia_[21], who is already weary of this cursed Casale, because it\r\nwill not surrender? _que dira el conde duque?_[22] who trembles if a\r\nleaf makes more noise than usual? _Que dira el rey nuestro se\xc3\xb1or?_[23]\r\nwho must necessarily be informed of so great a tumult? And is it at an\r\nend? _Dios lo sabe._\xe2\x80\x9d[24]\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, as for me, I will have nothing more to\r\ndo with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the superintendent. \xe2\x80\x9cI wash my hands of it. I resign\r\nmy office into the hands of your excellency, and I will go and live in a\r\ncavern on a mountain, as a hermit, far, very far from this savage\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      [20] Rise, rise, we are beyond danger.\r\n\r\n      [21] What will his excellency say to this?\r\n\r\n      [22] What will the count duke say?\r\n\r\n      [23] What will the king our master say?\r\n\r\n      [24] God knows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Usted_[25] will do that which is best _por el servicio de su\r\nmajestad_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the high chancellor, gravely.\r\n\r\n      [25] You\xe2\x80\x94for his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis majesty does not desire my death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the superintendent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, in a cavern, in a cavern far from these cruel people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not known what became of this project, as, after conducting the\r\npoor man in safety to his castle, our author makes no farther mention of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd began to disperse; some went home to take care of their\r\nfamilies, some wandered off from the desire to breathe more freely,\r\nafter such a squeeze, and others sought their acquaintances, to chat\r\nwith them over the deeds of the day. The other end of the street was\r\nalso thinning, so that the detachment of Spanish soldiers could without\r\nresistance advance near the superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s house. In front of it there\r\nstill remained, so to speak, the dregs of the commotion; a company of\r\nthe seditious, who, discontented with \xe2\x80\x9cso lame and impotent a\r\nconclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d of that which promised so much, muttered curses at the\r\ndisappointment, and united themselves in knots to consult with each\r\nother on the possibility of yet attempting something; and, to afford\r\nthemselves proof that this was in their power, they attacked and pounded\r\nthe poor door, which had been propped up anew from within. At the\r\narrival of the troop, however, their valour diminished, and without\r\nfurther consultation they dispersed, leaving the place free to the\r\nsoldiers, who took possession, in order to serve as a guard to the house\r\nand road. But the streets and small squares of the vicinity were full of\r\nlittle gatherings; where three or four individuals stopped, twenty were\r\nsoon added to them; there was a confused and constant babbling; one\r\nnarrated with emphasis the peculiar incidents of which he had been the\r\nwitness, another related his own feats, another rejoiced that the affair\r\nhad ended so happily, loaded Ferrer with praises, and predicted serious\r\nconsequences to the superintendent; to which another still replied,\r\nthat there was no danger of it, because wolves do not eat wolves;\r\nothers, in anger, muttered that they had been duped, and that they were\r\nfools to allow themselves to be deceived in this manner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had set, and twilight threw the same indistinct hue\r\nover every object. Many, fatigued with the day, and wearied with\r\nconversing in the dark, returned to their houses. Our hero, after having\r\nassisted the carriage as far as was necessary, rejoiced when he beheld\r\nit in safety, and as soon as it was in his power left the crowd, so that\r\nhe might, once more, breathe freely. Hardly had he taken a few steps in\r\nthe open air, when he experienced a re-action after such excitement, and\r\nbegan to feel the need of food and repose; he therefore looked upward on\r\neither side, in search of a sign, which might hold out to him the\r\nprospect of satisfying his wants, as it was too late to think of going\r\nto the convent. Thus, walking with his eyes directed upward, he stumbled\r\non one of these groups, and his attention was attracted by hearing them\r\nspeak of designs and projects for the morrow; it appeared to him that\r\nhe, who had been such a labourer in the field, had a right to give his\r\nopinion. Persuaded from all he had witnessed during the day, that, in\r\norder to secure the success of an enterprise, it was only necessary to\r\ngain the co-operation of the populace, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, in a tone\r\nof exordium, \xe2\x80\x9callow me to offer my humble opinion. My humble opinion is\r\nthis; it is not only in the matter of bread that iniquity is practised:\r\nand since we have discovered to-day, that we have only to make ourselves\r\nheard, to obtain justice, we must go on, until we obtain redress for all\r\ntheir other knavish tricks\xe2\x80\x94until we compel them to act like Christians.\r\nIs it not true, gentlemen, that there is a band of tyrants who reverse\r\nthe tenth commandment; who commit injuries on the peaceful and the poor,\r\nand in the end make it out that they act justly? And even when they have\r\ncommitted a greater villany than usual, they carry their heads higher\r\nthen ever. There are some such even in Milan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo many,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say it, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cit has even reached our ears. And then\r\nthe thing speaks for itself. By way of illustration, let us suppose one\r\nof those to whom I allude to have one foot in Milan, and the other\r\nelsewhere; if he is a devil there, will he be an angel here? Tell me,\r\ngentlemen, have you ever seen one of these people with a countenance\r\nlike Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s? But what renders their practices more wicked, I assure\r\nyou that there are printed proclamations against them, in which their\r\nevil deeds are clearly pointed out, and a punishment assigned to each,\r\nand it is written, \xe2\x80\x98_Whoever he be, ignoble and plebeian_, &c. &c.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\ngo now to the doctors, scribes, and pharisees, and demand justice\r\naccording to the proclamation; they listen to you as the pope does to\r\nrogues: it is enough to make an honest man turn rascal! It is evident,\r\nthat the king and those who govern would willingly punish the villains,\r\nbut they can do nothing, because there is a league among them. We must\r\nbreak it up, then; we must go to-morrow to Ferrer, who is a good worthy\r\nman; it was plain how delighted he was to-day to find himself among the\r\npoor; how he tried to hear what was said to him, and how kindly he\r\nanswered them. We must go, then, to Ferrer, and inform him how things\r\nare situated; and I, for my part, can tell him something that will\r\nastonish him; I, who have seen with my own eyes a proclamation, with\r\never so many coats of arms at the head of it, and which had been made by\r\nthree of the rulers; their names were printed at the bottom, and one of\r\nthese names was Ferrer; this I saw with my own eyes! Now this\r\nproclamation was exactly suited to my case; so that I demanded justice\r\nfrom the doctor, since it was the desire of these three lords, among\r\nwhom was Ferrer; but in the eyes of this very doctor, who had himself\r\nshown me this fine proclamation, I appeared to be a madman. I am sure\r\nthat when this dear old man shall hear these doings, especially in the\r\ncountry, he will not let the world go on in this manner, but will\r\nquickly find some remedy. And then, they themselves, if they issue\r\nproclamations, they should wish to see them obeyed; for it is an insult,\r\nan epitaph, with their _name_, if counted for nothing. And if the\r\nnobility will not lower their pretensions, and cease their evil doings,\r\nwe must compel them as we have done to-day. I do not say that he should\r\ngo in his carriage to take all the rascals to gaol\xe2\x80\x94it would need Noah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nark for that; he must give orders to those whose business it is, not\r\nonly at Milan but elsewhere, to put the proclamations in force, to enter\r\nan action against such as have been guilty of those iniquities, and\r\nwhere the edict says, \xe2\x80\x98Prison,\xe2\x80\x99 then prison; where it says, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ngalleys,\xe2\x80\x99 the galleys; and to say to the various _podest\xc3\xa0_ that they\r\nmust conduct themselves uprightly, or they shall be dismissed and others\r\nput in their place, and then, as I say, we will be there also to lend a\r\nhelping hand, and to command the doctors to listen to the poor, and talk\r\nreasonably. Am I not right, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo had spoken so vehemently, that he had attracted the attention of\r\nthe assembly, and, dropping by degrees all other discourse, they had all\r\nbecome his listeners. A confused clamour of applause, a \xe2\x80\x9cbravo!\r\ncertainly! assuredly! he is right, it is but too true,\xe2\x80\x9d followed his\r\nharangue. Critics, however, were not wanting. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pretty thing,\r\nindeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cto listen to a mountaineer! they are all lawyers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he turned on his heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered another, \xe2\x80\x9cevery barefooted fellow will give his opinion,\r\nand with this rage for meddling, we shall at last not have bread at a\r\nlow price, and that is all that disturbs us.\xe2\x80\x9d Compliments, however, were\r\nall that reached the ears of Renzo; they seized his hands, and\r\nexclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see you again to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the square of the cathedral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very well. And something shall be done, something shall be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of these good gentlemen will show me an inn, where I may obtain\r\nrefreshment and repose for the night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the one for your service, worthy youth,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, who had\r\nlistened to the sermon very attentively, but had not yet opened his\r\nmouth; \xe2\x80\x9cI know an inn, that will suit you exactly; I will recommend you\r\nto the keeper, who is my friend, and moreover a very honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assembly dissolved; and Renzo, after many shakes of the hand, from\r\npersons unknown, followed his guide, adding many thanks for his\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing, it is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cone hand washes the other, and\r\nboth the face. We ought to oblige our neighbour.\xe2\x80\x9d As they walked along,\r\nhe put many questions to Renzo, by way of discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not from curiosity, nor to meddle with your affairs, but you\r\nappear to be fatigued. From what country do you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the way from Lecco, all the way from Lecco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the way from Lecco! Are you from Lecco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Lecco; that is to say, from the province.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor youth! From what I have understood of your discourse, it appears\r\nyou have been hardly treated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear and worthy man, I have been obliged to use much skill in\r\nspeaking, not to make the public acquainted with my affairs; but\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nenough that they will one day be known, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But I see here a\r\nsign, and, by my faith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to go farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; come to the place I told you of, it is but a short distance\r\noff. You will not be well accommodated here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. I am not a gentleman accustomed to delicacies; any thing to\r\nsatisfy my hunger; and a little straw will answer my purpose: that which\r\nI have most at heart is to find them both very soon, under Providence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he entered a large gate, from which hung a sign of the _Full Moon_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will conduct you here, since you desire it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unknown;\r\nand Renzo followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity for troubling you longer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cdo me the favour to go in, and take a glass with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept your obliging offer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and preceding Renzo as being\r\nmore accustomed to the house, he entered a little court-yard,\r\napproached a glass door, and opening it, advanced into the kitchen with\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\nIt was lighted by two lamps suspended from the beam of the ceiling. Many\r\npeople, all busy, were seated on benches which surrounded a narrow\r\ntable, occupying almost all one side of the apartment; at intervals\r\nnapkins were spread, and dishes of meat; cards played, and dice thrown;\r\nand bottles and wine-glasses amid them all. _Berlinghe_, _reali_, and\r\n_parpagliole_[26], were also scattered in profusion over the table,\r\nwhich, could they have spoken, would probably have said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe were this\r\nmorning in a baker\xe2\x80\x99s counter, or in the pocket of some spectator of the\r\ntumult, who, occupied with public affairs, neglected the care of private\r\naffairs.\xe2\x80\x9d The confusion was great; a boy ran to and fro busily engaged\r\nin attending to the dinner and gaming tables; the host was seated on a\r\nlow bench under the mantle-tree of the chimney, apparently occupied in\r\ntracing figures in the ashes with the tongs, but in reality deeply\r\nattentive to all that passed around him. He raised his head at the sound\r\nof the latch, and turned towards the new comers. When he saw the guide,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse the fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9che must always be under my\r\nfeet, when I wish him at the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d Casting a rapid glance towards\r\nRenzo, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you not; but if you come with such a\r\nhunter, you are either a dog or a hare. When you shall have spoken a few\r\nwords, I shall know which of the two you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      [26] Different coins.\r\n\r\nNothing of this mute soliloquy could be traced, however, in the\r\ncountenance of the host, who was motionless as a statue: his eyes were\r\nsmall and without expression, his face fat and shining, and his short\r\nand thick beard of a reddish hue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your orders, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, a good flagon of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cand then something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo saying, he threw himself on a bench at one end of the table, and\r\nuttered a loud and sonorous _Ah!_ as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good thing to\r\nsit down after having been so long on one\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\xe2\x80\x9d But recollecting the\r\ntable at which he had been seated the evening before with Agnes and\r\nLucy, he sighed deeply. The host brought the wine; his companion had\r\nseated himself opposite to him; Renzo filled a glass for him, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wet your lips,\xe2\x80\x9d and another for himself, which he swallowed at a\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you give me to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good piece of stewed meat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, a good piece of stewed meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be served immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, and calling to the\r\nboy, \xe2\x80\x9cServe this gentleman. But,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, turning again to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave no bread to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, in a loud voice, and laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cProvidence\r\nhas provided that.\xe2\x80\x9d And he drew forth the third and last loaf, picked up\r\nunder the cross of _St. Dionigi_, and holding it up, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the\r\nbread of Providence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this exclamation many of the company turned round, and seeing this\r\ntrophy in the air, one of them cried, \xe2\x80\x9cBread for ever at a low price!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a low price!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9c_gratis et amore_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter still, better still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish these gentlemen to think evil of me. I\r\nhave not stolen it\xe2\x80\x94I found it on the ground; and if I could find the\r\nowner, I am ready to pay him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, bravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried they, laughing louder still, not imagining that he\r\nwas in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey think that I jest, but it is really so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo to his guide,\r\nand turning the bread in his hand; \xe2\x80\x9csee how they have formed it\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwould call it a cake, but they were so packed one on the other. If there\r\nwere any with the crust a little tender, one might know they were\r\nfresh.\xe2\x80\x9d Then devouring three or four mouthfulls of the bread, he washed\r\nthem down with another glass of wine, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThe bread will not go\r\ndown alone\xe2\x80\x94my throat was never so dry\xe2\x80\x94a glorious uproar we made!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepare a good bed for this young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guide; \xe2\x80\x9che is going to\r\npass the night here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to sleep here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the host to Renzo, approaching the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; I shall be content with any bed, provided the sheets are\r\nwhite; for although poor, I am accustomed to cleanliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the host. So saying, he went to his counter,\r\nwhich was in a corner of the kitchen, and returned, bringing in his hand\r\npaper, pen, and ink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d swallowing a piece of the stew which had been\r\nplaced before him, and smiling with an air of surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cis that the\r\nwhite sheet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host, without replying, placed the paper on the table, and himself\r\nin an attitude to write, and with the pen in his hand, leaning towards\r\nRenzo, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo me the favour to tell me your name and country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has this to do with the bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, looking at the guide. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are obliged to\r\ngive an exact account of all who lodge at our house. _Name and surname,\r\nand from what country they are; why they are here; if they have arms;\r\nand how long they expect to remain in the city._ These are the very\r\nwords of the proclamation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore answering, Renzo emptied another glass; it was the third, but I\r\nfear for the future we shall not find it possible to count them. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the proclamation. Well, I pride myself on\r\nbeing a doctor of laws, and I know what importance is attached to\r\nproclamations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak in earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, looking again at the mute companion\r\nof Renzo; and returning to his desk, he drew from it a large sheet of\r\npaper, which he unfolded before Renzo, as an exact copy of the\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, quickly emptying the contents of the glass\r\nwhich he held in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! there it is! the fine sheet! I rejoice\r\nto see it. I know these arms; I know what this pagan head means with a\r\nnoose around its neck.\xe2\x80\x9d (The proclamations of that time were headed by\r\nthe arms of the governor, and in those of Don Gonzalo Fernandez de\r\nCordova was seen a Moorish king, chained by the throat.) \xe2\x80\x9cThis face\r\nmeans, Command who can, and obey who will. When the Signor Don \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 shall\r\nhave been sent to the galleys\xe2\x80\x94well, well, I know what I would say\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave seen another leaf just like this. When he shall have so taken\r\nmeasures that an honest young man can, without molestation, marry her to\r\nwhom he is betrothed, and by whom he is beloved, then I will tell my\r\nname to this face, and will give him a kiss in the bargain. I may have\r\nvery good reasons for not telling my name; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing, truly! And\r\nif a robber, who might have under his command a band of villains,\r\nbecause if he were alone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated a moment, finishing the\r\nphrase with a gesture, and then proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cIf a robber wished to know\r\nwho I was, in order to do me some evil turn, I ask you if that face\r\nwould move from the paper to help me. Am I obliged to tell my business?\r\nTruly, this is something new. Suppose, for instance, that I have come to\r\nMilan to confess\xe2\x80\x94I would wish to do it to a capuchin father, and not to\r\nthe landlord of an inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host kept silence, looking at the guide, who appeared not to notice\r\nany thing that passed. Renzo, it grieves us to say, swallowed another\r\nglass, and continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you reasons enough to satisfy you, my\r\ndear host; if those proclamations which speak favourably of good\r\nChristians are worth nothing, those which speak unfavourably are worth\r\nless than nothing. Take away, then, all these encumbrances, and bring in\r\nexchange another flagon, because this one is broken.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he\r\nstruck it lightly with his hand, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you hear how it is\r\ncracked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discourse of Renzo had again attracted the general attention of the\r\ncompany, and when he concluded, there was a general murmur of applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, looking at the strange companion, who\r\nwas, however, no stranger to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried many of the company, \xe2\x80\x9cthis countryman is right; they\r\nare vexatious impositions. New laws to-day! new laws to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger took advantage of the noise to say to the host, in a tone\r\nof reproach for his too abrupt demand, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave him to his own way a\r\nlittle; do not raise a disturbance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cand secured myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he, lowering his voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand that is all I care for.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nremoved the pen, ink, and paper, and gave the empty flagon to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring the same kind of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it suits my taste\r\nexactly; and we will send it to sleep with the other, without asking its\r\nname, surname, nor what is its business, nor whether it is going to\r\nremain long in this city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the same kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host to the boy, giving him the flagon, and\r\nreturning to his seat by the chimney. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is no other than a hare,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought he, raking in the ashes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in what hands art thou fallen,\r\npoor silly youth! If you will drown, drown; but the host of the _Full\r\nMoon_ will not go halves with thy folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo returned thanks to his guide, and to all those who had taken his\r\nside. \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that honest people support each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d Then striking the table, and placing himself in the attitude of\r\nan orator, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not an unheard of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat those who\r\ngovern must always introduce paper, pen, and ink? Always the pen in\r\nhand! Such a passion for the pen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! young and worthy stranger! would you know the reason?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\r\nthe gamesters, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason is, as these lords eat geese, they have so many quills, they\r\nknow not what to do with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a poet! You have poets here, then? I have\r\nalso a vein for poetry, and I sometimes make verses\xe2\x80\x94but it is when\r\nthings go on well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo comprehend this witticism of poor Renzo, it is necessary to be\r\ninformed, that in the eyes of the vulgar of Milan, and more particularly\r\nin its environs, the name of poet did not signify, as among cultivated\r\npeople, a sublime genius, an inhabitant of Pindus, a pupil of the muses,\r\nbut a whimsicality and eccentricity in discourse and conduct, which had\r\nmore of singularity than sense; and an absurd wresting of words from\r\ntheir legitimate signification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will tell the true reason,\xe2\x80\x9d added Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because they\r\nthemselves hold the pen, and, therefore, they do not record their own\r\nwords; but let a poor man speak, they are very attentive, and in a\r\nmoment, _there_ it is, in black and white for some future occasion. They\r\nare cunning, also; and when they want to perplex a poor youth, who does\r\nnot know how to read, but who has a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I know well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d beating\r\nhis forehead with his hand, and pointing to it with his finger, to make\r\nhimself understood; \xe2\x80\x9cand when they perceive that he begins to comprehend\r\nthe difficulty, they throw into the conversation some Latin, to make him\r\nlose the thread of their argument, to put him at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end, to\r\nconfuse his brains. This custom must be broken up: to-day, every thing\r\nhas been done after the people\xe2\x80\x99s fashion, without paper, pen, and ink.\r\nTo-morrow, if they know how to conduct themselves, we shall do still\r\nbetter, without hurting a hair of any one\xe2\x80\x99s head; all in the way of\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the mean while some of the company had engaged again in play, and\r\nsome in eating; some went away, others came in their place. The unknown\r\nguide continued to remain; and without appearing to have any business to\r\ndetain him, lingered to talk a little more with Renzo, and resumed the\r\nconversation about bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had the control, I would order things better,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, endeavouring to exhibit every\r\nappearance of attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would I do? Every one should have bread\xe2\x80\x94the poor as well as the\r\nrich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how I would do. I would fix a reasonable rate within the ability of\r\nevery one; then bread should be distributed according to the number of\r\nmouths, because there are gluttons who seize all they can get for\r\nthemselves, and leave the poor still in want. We must then divide it.\r\nAnd how shall we do this? Why in this way. Give a ticket to every family\r\nin proportion to the mouths, to authorise them to get bread from the\r\nbakers. For example: they give me a ticket expressed in this manner;\r\nAmbrose Fusella, by trade a sword cutler, with a wife and four children,\r\nall old enough to eat bread (mind that); he must be furnished with so\r\nmuch bread at such a price. But the thing must be done in order, always\r\nwith regard to the number of mouths. For instance, they should give you\r\na ticket for\xe2\x80\x94your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Tramaglino,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, who, enchanted with the\r\nproject, did not reflect that it all depended on pen, ink, and paper;\r\nand that the first point towards its success was to collect the names of\r\nthe persons to be served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unknown; \xe2\x80\x9cbut have you a wife and children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have\xe2\x80\x94children, no\xe2\x80\x94not yet\xe2\x80\x94but a wife\xe2\x80\x94if people had acted\r\nas their duty required\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are single! then have patience; they will only give you a\r\nsmaller portion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is but just. But if soon, as I hope\xe2\x80\x94by the help of God\xe2\x80\x94enough;\r\nsuppose I have a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the ticket must be changed, and the portion increased, as I have\r\nsaid, according to the mouths,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the unknown, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be very good,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, thumping the table with his\r\nfist; \xe2\x80\x9cand why don\xe2\x80\x99t they make such a law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell you? meanwhile I wish you a good night, as my wife and\r\nchildren must have been expecting me this long while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother drop, another drop,\xe2\x80\x9d filling his glass, and endeavouring to\r\nforce him to sit down again; \xe2\x80\x9canother drop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his friend contrived to disengage himself; and leaving Renzo,\r\npouring forth a torrent of entreaties and reproaches, he departed. Renzo\r\ncontinued to talk until he was in the street, and then fell back on his\r\nseat. He looked at the glass which he had filled to the brim; and seeing\r\nthe boy pass before the table, he beckoned to him, as if he had\r\nsomething particular to communicate. He pointed to the glass, and with a\r\ntone of solemnity said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee there! I prepared it for that worthy man;\r\nyou see it is full, as it should be for a friend; but he would not have\r\nit. Sometimes people have singular ideas; however, I have shown my good\r\nwill; but now, since the thing is done, it must not be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying,\r\nhe emptied it at one draught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, moving off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand too, do you? It is true, when the reasons are\r\nsufficient\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere we have need of all our love of truth to induce us to pursue\r\nfaithfully our hero\xe2\x80\x99s history; at the same time this same impartiality\r\nleads us to inform the reader, that this was his first error of a\r\nsimilar character; and precisely because he was so unaccustomed to\r\nmerry-making did this prove so fatal. The few glasses of wine which he\r\nswallowed so rapidly, contrary to his custom, partly to cool his throat,\r\nand partly from an exaltation of spirits, which deprived him of the\r\npower of reflection, went immediately to his head. Upon an habitual\r\ndrinker it would have produced no visible effect; our author observes\r\nthis, that \xe2\x80\x9ctemperate and moderate habits have this advantage, that the\r\nmore a man practises them, the more he finds a departure from them to be\r\ndisagreeable and inconvenient; so that his fault itself serves as a\r\nlesson to him for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, when these first fumes had mounted to the brain of\r\nRenzo, wine and words continued to flow without rule or reason. He felt\r\na great desire to speak, and for a while his words were arranged with\r\nsome degree of order, but by little and little he found it difficult to\r\nform a connected sentence. The thoughts which presented themselves to\r\nhis mind were cloudy and indistinct, and his expressions, in\r\nconsequence, unconnected and obscure: to relieve his perplexity, by one\r\nof those false instincts which, under similar circumstances, lead men to\r\nthe accomplishment of their own ruin, he had recourse to the flagon.\r\n\r\nWe will relate only a few of the words which he continued to ejaculate,\r\nduring the remainder of this miserable evening. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! host, host,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed he, following him with his eye around the table, or gazing at\r\nhim where he was not, and taking no notice of the noise of the company,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chost that thou art! I cannot swallow it\xe2\x80\x94this request of name, surname,\r\nand business. To a peaceable youth like me! you have not behaved well!\r\nwhat satisfaction, what advantage, what pleasure\xe2\x80\x94to put a poor youth on\r\npaper? Am I not right\xe2\x80\x94speak, gentlemen? Hosts should stand by good\r\nfellows. Listen, listen, host, I wish to make a comparison for you\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94They laugh, do they? I am a little gay, I know; but the\r\nreasons, I say, are just. Tell me, if you please, who is it that brings\r\ncustom to your house? Poor young men, is it not? Do these lords, they of\r\nthe proclamations, ever come here to wet their lips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all water-drinkers,\xe2\x80\x9d said one who sat near Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wish to keep possession of their understandings, so as to tell\r\nlies skilfully,\xe2\x80\x9d added another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the poet who spoke. Then hear my reasons.\r\nAnswer me, host. Ferrer, who is the best of all of them, has he ever\r\nbeen here to drink the health of any one, and to spend so much as a\r\nfarthing? And this dog of an assassin, this Don \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94? I must be silent,\r\nbecause I am too much in the humour for babbling. Ferrer, and Father\r\nCrr\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, I know, are two honest men. But there are few honest men. The\r\nold are worse than the young; and the young\xe2\x80\x94are much worse than the\r\nold. I am glad there was no blood shed, these are things we must leave\r\nto the hangman. Bread! Oh yes, for that I have had many a thrust, but I\r\nhave also given some. Make way! Abundance! _vivat!_ And Ferrer too\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nwords in Latin,\xe2\x80\x94_Si es baraos trapolorum._ Cursed fault! _vivat!_\r\njustice! bread! Ah, those are good words! We had need of them. When we\r\nheard that cursed ton, ton, ton, and then again, ton, ton, ton, the\r\nquestion was not of flight; but hold the signor curate to\xe2\x80\x94I, I know\r\nwhat I am thinking of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words he hung down his head, and remained for a time as if\r\nabsorbed by some new imagination; then, sighing deeply, he raised it\r\nagain, and looked up with such a mournful and silly expression, as\r\nexcited the amusement of all around. In short, he became the\r\nlaughingstock of the whole company. Not that they were all perfectly\r\nsober, but, to say truth, they were so in comparison with poor Renzo.\r\nThey provoked and angered him with silly questions, and with mock\r\ncivilities; sometimes he pretended to be offended, then, without\r\nnoticing them at all, spoke of other things; then replied, then\r\ninterrogated, and always wide of the mark. By good fortune, in his\r\nfolly, he seemed from instinct to avoid pronouncing the names of\r\npersons; so that the one most deeply graven in his memory was not\r\nuttered. We should have been sorry ourselves if this name, for which we\r\nfeel so much love and respect, had passed from mouth to mouth, and been\r\nmade a theme of jesting by these vulgar and degraded wretches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe host, seeing that the game was about to be carried too far,\r\napproached Renzo, and entreating the others to be quiet, endeavoured to\r\nmake him understand that he had best go to bed. But our mountaineer\r\ncould think of nothing but _name_, _surname_, and _proclamations_; yet\r\nthe words _bed_ and _sleep_, repeated frequently in his ear, made at\r\nlast some impression, and producing a sort of lucid interval, made him\r\nfeel that he really had need of both. The little sense that remained to\r\nhim enabled him to perceive that the greater part of the company had\r\ndeparted; and with his hands resting on the table before him, he\r\nendeavoured to stand on his feet; his efforts would have been, however,\r\nunavailing, without the assistance of the host, who led him from between\r\nthe table and the bench, and taking a lantern in one hand, managed\r\npartly to lead and partly to drag him to the stairs, and thence up the\r\nnarrow staircase to the room designed for him. At the sight of the bed,\r\nhe endeavoured to look kindly upon the host; but his eyes at one time\r\nsparkled, at another disappeared, like two fireflies: he endeavoured to\r\nstand erect, and stretched out his hand to pat the shoulder of his host\r\nin testimony of his gratitude; but in this he failed: however he did\r\nsucceed in saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy host, I see now that you are an honest man;\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your rage for _name_ and _surname_. Happily I am\r\nalso\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host, who did not expect to hear him utter one connected idea, and\r\nwho knew from experience how prone men in his situation were to sudden\r\nchanges of feeling, wishing to profit by this lucid interval, made\r\nanother attempt. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a tone of persuasion, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not intended to vex you, nor to pry into your affairs. What would\r\nyou have had me do? There is a law, and if we innkeepers do not obey it,\r\nwe shall be the first to be punished; therefore it is better to conform.\r\nAnd after all, as regards yourself, what is it? A hard thing, indeed!\r\njust to say two words. It is not for them, but to do me a favour. Now,\r\nhere, between ourselves, tell me your _name_, and then you shall go to\r\nbed in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, rascal! knave!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you dare to bring up this cursed\r\n_name_ and _surname_ and _business_ again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! you fool! and go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host.\r\n\r\nBut Renzo continued to bellow, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand it, you belong to the\r\nleague. Wait, wait, till I settle matters for you;\xe2\x80\x9d and turning to the\r\ndoor, he bellowed down the stairs, \xe2\x80\x9cFriends! the host is of the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke in jest,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host, pushing him towards the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\njest; did you not perceive I spoke in jest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, in jest; now you talk reasonably. Since you said it in jest\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nare just the thing to make a jest of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d And he fell on the bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndress yourself quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host; and adding his assistance to\r\nhis advice, the thought occurred to him, to ascertain if there were any\r\nmoney in Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, as on the morrow it would fall into hands from\r\nwhich an innkeeper would have but little chance of recovering it; he\r\ntherefore hazarded another attempt, saying to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an honest\r\nyouth, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, an honest youth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, still endeavouring to rid himself\r\nof his clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, settle this little account with me now, because to-morrow I am\r\nobliged to leave home on business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo \xe2\x80\x9cI am honest. But the money\xe2\x80\x94we must find the\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host; and calling up all his patience and skill,\r\nhe succeeded in obtaining the reckoning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend me your hand to finish undressing, host,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to\r\ncomprehend, do you see, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I am very sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host rendered him the desired service, and covering him with the\r\nquilt, bade him \xe2\x80\x9cGood night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely uttered before poor Renzo snored. The host\r\nstopped to contemplate him a moment by the light of his lantern; \xe2\x80\x9cMad\r\nblockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the poor sleeper, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast accomplished thy own\r\nruin! dunces, who want to travel over the world, without knowing where\r\nthe sun rises, to entangle themselves with affairs they know nothing of,\r\nto their own injury and that of their neighbour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he left the apartment, having locked the door outside, and\r\ncalling to his wife, told her to take his place in the kitchen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must go out for a while, thanks to a stranger who\r\nis here, unhappily for me;\xe2\x80\x9d he then briefly related the annoying\r\ncircumstance, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now keep an eye on all, and above all be\r\nprudent. There is below a company of dissolute fellows, who, between\r\ndrink and their natural disposition, are very very free of speech.\r\nEnough\xe2\x80\x94if any of them should dare\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am not a child! I know what I ought to do. It could never be\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well. Be careful to make them pay. If they talk of the\r\nsuperintendant of provision, the governor, Ferrer, and the council of\r\nten, and the gentry, and Spain and France, and other follies, pretend\r\nnot to hear them, because, if you contradict them, it may go ill with\r\nyou now, and if you argue with them, it may go ill with you hereafter;\r\nand take care, when you hear any dangerous remarks, turn away your\r\nhead, and call out \xe2\x80\x98Coming, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 I will endeavour to return as soon as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he descended with her into the kitchen, put on his hat and\r\ncloak, and taking a cudgel in his hand, departed. As he walked along the\r\nroad, he resumed the thread of his apostrophe to poor Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cHeadstrong\r\nmountaineer!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for that Renzo was such, had been manifest from his\r\npronunciation, countenance, and manners, although he vainly tried to\r\nconceal it,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9con a day like this, when by dint of skill and prudence I\r\nhad kept my hands clean, you must come at the end of it to spoil all I\r\nhave done! Are there not inns enough in Milan, that you must come to\r\nmine! at least, if you had been alone, I would have winked at it for\r\nto-night, and made you understand matters to-morrow. But no; my\r\ngentleman must come in company, and, to do the thing better, in company\r\nwith an informer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment he perceived a patrole of soldiers approaching; drawing\r\non one side to let them pass, and eyeing them askance, he continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere go the fool-punishers. And thou, great booby, because thou saw\xe2\x80\x99st\r\na few people making a little noise, thou must think the world was turned\r\nupside down; and on this fine foundation thou hast ruined thyself and\r\nwould have ruined me; I have done all I could to save thee, now thou\r\nmust get thyself out of trouble. As if I wanted to know thy name from\r\ncuriosity! What was it to me whether it were Thaddeus or Bartholomew? I\r\nhave truly great satisfaction in taking a pen in my hand! I know well\r\nenough that there are proclamations which are disregarded; just as if we\r\nhad need of a mountaineer to tell us that! And dost thou not know, thou\r\nfool! what would be done to a poor innkeeper, who should be of thy\r\nopinion (since upon them the proclamation bear hardest), and should not\r\ninform himself of the name of any one who did him the favour to lodge at\r\nhis house. _Under penalty of whoever of the above-said hosts, tavern\r\nkeepers, and others, of three hundred crowns_,\xe2\x80\x94behold three hundred\r\ncrowns hatched; and now to spend them well,\xe2\x80\x94_two thirds to be applied\r\nto the royal chamber, and the other third to the accuser or informer.\r\nAnd in case of inability, five years in the galleys, and greater\r\npecuniary and corporal punishments, at the discretion of his\r\nExcellency._ Very much obliged for such favours, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d He ended his\r\nsoliloquy, finding himself at his destined point, the palace of the\r\n_Capitano di Giustizia_.\r\n\r\nThere, as in all the offices of the secretaries, there was a great deal\r\nof business going on; on all sides, persons were employed in issuing\r\norders to ensure the peace of the following day, to take from rebellion\r\nevery pretext, to cool the audacity of those who were desirous of fresh\r\ndisorders, and to concentrate power in the hands of those accustomed to\r\nexercise it. The number of the soldiers who protected the house of the\r\nsuperintendant was increased; the ends of the streets were defended by\r\nlarge pieces of timber thrown across them; the bakers were ordered to\r\nbake bread without intermission; expresses were sent to all the\r\nsurrounding villages, with orders to send corn into the city; and at\r\nevery baker\xe2\x80\x99s some of the nobility were stationed, to watch over the\r\ndistribution, and to restrain the discontented by fair words and the\r\nauthority of their presence. But to give, as they said, a blow to the\r\nhoop, and another to the cask, and increase the efficacy of their\r\ncaresses by a little awe, they took measures to seize some of the\r\nseditious, and this was the principal duty of the _Capitano di\r\nGiustizia_. His blood-hounds had been in the field since the\r\ncommencement of the tumult; and this self-styled Ambrose Fusella was a\r\npolice officer in disguise, who, having listened to the famous sermon of\r\nRenzo, concluded him to be fair game. Finding that he had but newly\r\narrived from his village, he would have conducted him immediately to\r\nprison, as the safest inn in the city; but in this, as we have seen, he\r\ndid not succeed. He could, however, carry to the police certain\r\ninformation of his _name_, _surname_, and _country_, besides many other\r\nconjectures; so that when the host arrived to tell what he knew of\r\nRenzo, their knowledge was already more precise than his. He entered the\r\naccustomed hall, and gave in his deposition, that a stranger had come to\r\nlodge at his house, who would not tell his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done your duty in giving us the information,\xe2\x80\x9d said a notary,\r\nlaying down his pen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we know it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very singular!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the host; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have a great deal\r\nof cunning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know also,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the notary, \xe2\x80\x9cthis famous name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! the name also. How do they know that?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the host\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the notary, with a serious air, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not tell all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there more to tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! we know well that this man carried to your house a quantity of\r\nstolen bread\xe2\x80\x94bread acquired by theft and sedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man comes with bread in his pocket; am I to know where he got it? if\r\nit was on my death-bed, I can say, I only saw him have one loaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus it is! you are always excusing and defending yourselves! If we\r\nwere to take your word for it, you are all honest people. How can you\r\nprove that this bread was honestly acquired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy need I prove it? it is nothing to me. I am an innkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot, however, deny, that this, your customer, had the audacity\r\nto complain of the proclamations, and make indecent jokes on the arms of\r\nhis Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, signor; how could he be my customer, when I never saw him\r\nbefore? It was the devil, saving your presence, who sent him to my\r\nhouse. If I had known him, there would have been no need of asking his\r\nname, as your honour knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, in your inn, and in your presence, seditious and inflammatory\r\nconversation has been held; your customers have been riotous, clamorous,\r\nand complaining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would your honour expect me to pay attention to the absurdities\r\nuttered by a parcel of brawlers. I attend only to my own affairs, for I\r\nam a poor man. And then your honour knows, that those who are lavish of\r\ntheir tongue, are often lavish of their fists, especially when there are\r\nmany together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, they may have their way now; to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow, we will\r\nsee if the heat is dislodged from their brains. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the mob will become masters in Milan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see, you shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand\xe2\x80\x94I know the king will be always the king; but he who has\r\ntaken any thing will keep it. Naturally a poor father of a family has no\r\ndesire to give back; your honours have the power; that belongs to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you still some people at your house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this your customer, what is he about? Is he still labouring to\r\nexcite the people to sedition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis stranger, your honour means; he is gone to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have a number? Well, be careful not to let them go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to play the constable?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the host, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn to your house, and be prudent,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the notary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always been prudent. Your honour can say that I have never made\r\nany disturbance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; but do not think that justice has lost its power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! Good heavens! I think nothing. I am an innkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same old tune. Have you nothing more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else would your honour have me say? Truth is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; you have done enough for to-day: but to-morrow, we will see; you\r\nmust give more full information, and answer all questions that shall be\r\nput to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat information have I to give? I know nothing; I have hardly brains\r\nenough to attend to my own affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care not to let him go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope your honour will remember that I have done my duty. Your\r\nhonour\xe2\x80\x99s humble servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Renzo was still in a sound and deep sleep,\r\nwhen he was suddenly roused by a shaking of the arms, and by a voice at\r\nthe foot of the bed, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Tramaglino!\xe2\x80\x9d He sat up, and\r\nrubbing his eyes, perceived a man clothed in black standing at the foot\r\nof his bed, and two others, one on each side of the bolster. Between\r\nsurprise, sleep, and the fumes of the wine, he remained a moment\r\nstupified, believing himself to be still dreaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you have heard at last! Lorenzo Tramaglino,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man in black,\r\nthe notary of the preceding evening. \xe2\x80\x9cUp, up; get up, and come with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Tramaglino!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo Tramaglino. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean? What\r\ndo you want with me? Who has told you my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew words, and get up quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men at his side,\r\nseizing him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! what violence is this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, drawing away his arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHost! oh! host!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we carry him off in his shirt?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the officers; turning\r\nto the notary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear what he said?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Renzo; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will do so, if you do\r\nnot rise quickly, and come with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear that from the _Capitano di Giustizia_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! I am an honest man; I have done nothing; I am astonished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for you! so much the better for you! In two words\r\nyou will be dismissed, and then go about your affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now, then; there is no reason why I should go before the\r\n_capitano_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us finish the business,\xe2\x80\x9d said an officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be obliged to carry him off!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Tramaglino!\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does your honour know my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo your duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the men, who attempted to draw Renzo from the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me! I can dress _myself_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDress yourself, then, and get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, and he gathered his clothes, scattered here and\r\nthere on the bed, like the fragments of a shipwreck on the coast. Whilst\r\nengaged in the act of dressing, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will not go to the\r\n_Capitano di Giustizia_; I have nothing to do with him: since you put\r\nthis affront on me, I wish to be conducted to Ferrer; I am acquainted\r\nwith him; I know he is an honest man, and he is under obligations to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, my good fellow, you shall be conducted to Ferrer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe notary.\r\n\r\nIn other circumstances he would have laughed heartily at the absurdity\r\nof such a proposition, but he felt that this was not a moment for\r\nmerriment. On his way to the inn, he had perceived so many people\r\nabroad, such a stirring\xe2\x80\x94some collecting in small quantities, others\r\ngathering in crowds\xe2\x80\x94that he was not able to determine whether they were\r\nthe remnants of the old insurrection not entirely suppressed, or the\r\nbeginnings of a new one. And now, without appearing to do so, he\r\nlistened, and thought the buzzing increased. He felt haste to be of\r\nimportance; but he did not dare to take Renzo against his will, lest,\r\nfinding himself in the street, he might take advantage of public\r\nsympathy, and endeavour to escape from his hands. He made a sign to his\r\nofficers to be patient, and not exasperate the youth; whilst he himself\r\nsought to appease him with fair words.\r\n\r\nRenzo meanwhile began to have a confused recollection of the events of\r\nthe preceding day, and to comprehend that the _proclamations_, _name_,\r\nand _surname_, were the cause of all this trouble; but how the devil did\r\nthis man know his name? And what the devil had happened during the\r\nnight, that they should come to lay hands on one, who, the day before,\r\nhad such a voice in the assembly, which could not be yet dispersed,\r\nbecause he also heard a growing murmur in the street. He perceived also\r\nthe agitation which the notary vainly endeavoured to conceal; therefore,\r\nto feel his pulse, and clear up his own conjectures, as well as to gain\r\ntime, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend the cause of all this, it is on account of\r\nthe _name_ and _surname_. Last night, \xe2\x80\x99tis true, I was a little merry;\r\nthese hosts have such treacherous wine and, you know, often when wine\r\npasses through the channel of speech, it will have its say too. But if\r\nthat is all the difficulty, I am ready to give you every satisfaction.\r\nBesides, you know my name already. Who the devil told it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! my good fellow, bravo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the notary in a tone of\r\nencouragement. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you are in the right, and you must believe that I\r\nam also. I am only following my trade. You are more tractable than\r\nothers. It is the easiest way to get out of the difficulty quickly. With\r\nsuch an accommodating spirit, you will soon be set at liberty; but my\r\nhands are tied, and I cannot release you now, although I would wish to\r\ndo so. Be of good courage, and come on boldly. When they see who you\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94and I will tell\xe2\x80\x94Leave it to me\xe2\x80\x94quick, quick, my good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you cannot! I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we pass by the square\r\nof the cathedral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you choose. We will go the shortest road, that you may be the\r\nsooner at liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, inwardly cursing his stars at being unable\r\nto follow up this mysterious demand of Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s, which might have been\r\nmade the subject of a hundred interrogatories. \xe2\x80\x9cMiserable that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought he, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a fellow fallen into my hands, who likes no better\r\nfun than to prate. Were there but a little time, he would confess all in\r\nthe way of friendly discourse, without the aid of rope. Ay! and without\r\nperceiving it too. But that he should fall into my hands at such an\r\nunlucky moment.\xe2\x80\x94Well, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, while turning\r\nhis head and listening to the noise without, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no remedy: this\r\nwill be a hotter day than yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat which gave rise to this last thought was an extraordinary uproar in\r\nthe street, which tempted him to open the window and reconnoitre. There\r\nwas a concourse of citizens, who, at the order given them by the patrole\r\nto separate, had resisted for a while, and then moved off, on all sides,\r\nin evident discontent. It was a fatal sign to the eyes of the notary,\r\nthat the soldiers treated them with much politeness. He closed the\r\nwindow, and remained for a moment undecided, whether he should conduct\r\nthe enterprise to an end, or, leaving Renzo in the care of the\r\nbailiffs, go himself to the _Capitano di Giustizia_, and relate the\r\nwhole difficulty. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9che will tell me I am a poltroon, a\r\ncoward, and that it was my business to execute orders. We are at the\r\nball; we must dance, it seems. Cursed crowd! what a damned business!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe, however addressed Renzo in a tone of kind entreaty, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, my worthy\r\nfellow, do let us be off, and make haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo, however, was not without his thoughts. He was almost dressed,\r\nwith the exception of his doublet, into the pockets of which he was\r\nfumbling. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, regarding the notary significantly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I had\r\na letter, and some money here, once, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen these formalities are over, all shall be faithfully restored to\r\nyou. Come, come, let us be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cthat won\xe2\x80\x99t do: I must have\r\nwhat belongs to me, sir. I will render an account of my actions, but I\r\nmust have what belongs to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you that I have confidence in you; here they are. And now\r\nmake haste,\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary, drawing from his bosom the sequestered\r\ngoods, and consigning them, with something like a sigh, to Renzo, who\r\nmuttered between his teeth, as he put them in his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have so\r\nmuch to do with thieves, that you have learned the trade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I get you once safe out of the house, you shall pay this with\r\ninterest,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the notary.\r\n\r\nAs Renzo was putting on his hat, the notary made a sign to the officers,\r\nthat one of them should go before, and the other follow the prisoner;\r\nand as they passed through the kitchen, and whilst Renzo was saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this blessed host, where has he fled?\xe2\x80\x9d they seized, one his right\r\nhand, the other the left, and skilfully slipped over his wrists,\r\nhand-fetters, as they were called, which, according to the customs of\r\nthe times, consisted of a cord, a little longer than the usual size of\r\nthe fist, which had at the two ends two small pieces of wood. The cord\r\nencircled the wrist of the patient; the captor held the pegs in his\r\nhand, so that he could, by twisting them, tighten the cord at will, and\r\nthis enabled him, not only to secure the prisoner, but also to torment\r\nhim, if restless; and, to ensure this more effectually, the cord was\r\nfull of knots.\r\n\r\nRenzo struggled and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat treachery is this? to an honest\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d But the notary, who had fair words prepared for every occasion,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBe patient, they only do their duty. What would you have? It is a\r\nmere ceremony. We cannot treat people as we would wish. If we did not\r\nobey orders, we should be worse off than you. Be patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the two operators twisted the pegs; Renzo plunged like a\r\nskittish horse upon the bit, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cPatience, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, worthy young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the only way to come\r\noff well in these affairs. It is troublesome, I confess, but it will\r\nsoon be over; and since I see you so well disposed, I feel an\r\ninclination to serve you, and will give you another piece of advice for\r\nyour good, which is, to pass on quietly, looking neither to right nor\r\nleft, so as to attract notice. If you do this, no one will pay any\r\nattention to you, and you will preserve your honour. In one hour you\r\nwill be at liberty. There are so many other things to be done, that your\r\nbusiness will soon be despatched; and then I will tell them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. You\r\nshall have your liberty, and no one will know you have been in the hands\r\nof the law. And you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he, addressing his followers in a tone of\r\nseverity, \xe2\x80\x9cdo him no harm, because I take him under my protection. You\r\nmust do your duty, I know; but remember that this is a worthy and honest\r\nyouth, who in a little while will be at liberty, and who has a regard\r\nfor his honour. Let nothing appear but that you are three peaceable men,\r\nwalking together. You understand me!\xe2\x80\x9d and smoothing his brow, and\r\ntwisting his face into a gracious smile, he said to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cA little\r\nprudence,\xe2\x80\x94do as I tell you; do not look about; trust to one who has\r\nyour interest at heart! And now let us begone.\xe2\x80\x9d And the convoy moved\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nBut of all these fine speeches Renzo believed not a word. He understood\r\nvery well the fears that prevailed over the mind of the notary, and his\r\nexhortations only served to confirm him in his purpose to escape; and to\r\nthis end to act directly contrary to the advice given him. No one must\r\nconclude from this that the notary was an inexperienced knave. On the\r\ncontrary, he was master of his trade, but at the present moment his\r\nspirits were agitated. At another time he would have ridiculed any one\r\nfor pursuing the measures he had now himself employed, but his agitation\r\nhad deprived him of his accustomed cunning and self-possession. We would\r\nrecommend, therefore, to all knaves by trade, to maintain on all\r\noccasions their _sang froid_, or, what is better, never to place\r\nthemselves in difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nRenzo, then, hardly found himself in the street, when he began to look\r\naround, and listen eagerly. There was not, however, an extraordinary\r\nconcourse of people; and although on the countenance of more than one\r\npasser-by you could read an expression of discontent and sedition, yet\r\neach one pursued his way in quietness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrudence! prudence!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the notary behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cYour honour,\r\nyoung man, your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Renzo heard three men, who were approaching, talk of a bakery,\r\nof flour concealed, of justice, he began to make signs to them, and\r\ncough in such a manner, as indicated any thing but a cold. They looked\r\nattentively at the convoy, and stopped; others who had passed by, turned\r\nback, and kept themselves a short distance off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care; be prudent, my good fellow; do not spoil all; your honour,\r\nyour reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary in a low voice, but unheeded by Renzo.\r\nThe men again twisted the pegs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the prisoner. At this cry the crowd thickened\r\naround; they gathered from all parts of the street. The convoy was\r\nstopped! \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a wicked fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the notary in a whisper to those\r\nnearest him; \xe2\x80\x9che is a thief taken in the fact. Draw back, and let\r\njustice have its way.\xe2\x80\x9d But Renzo perceived that the occasion was\r\nfavourable: he saw the officers pale and almost dead with fright. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\ndo not help myself now,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cso much the worse for me;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nraising his voice, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends; they are carrying me off,\r\nbecause I cried, \xe2\x80\x98Bread! and justice!\xe2\x80\x99 yesterday. I have done nothing;\r\nI am an honest man! Help me, do not abandon me, my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was answered by a light murmur, which soon changed to an unanimous\r\ncry in his favour. The officers ordered, requested, and entreated those\r\nnearest them to go off, and leave their passage free; but the crowd\r\ncontinued to press around. The officers, at the sight of the danger,\r\nleft their prisoner, and endeavoured to lose themselves in the throng,\r\nfor the purpose of escaping without being observed; and the notary\r\ndesired heartily to do the same, but found it more difficult on account\r\nof his black cloak. Pale as death, he endeavoured, by twisting his body\r\nto work his way through the crowd. He studied to appear a stranger, who,\r\npassing accidentally, had found himself in the crowd like a bit of straw\r\nin the ice; and finding himself face to face with a man who looked at\r\nhim more intently and sternly than the rest, he composed his countenance\r\nto a smile, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this confusion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you ugly raven!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cA raven! a raven!\xe2\x80\x9d resounded from all\r\nsides. To the cries they added threats, so that, finally, partly with\r\nhis own legs, partly with the elbows of others, he succeeded in\r\nobtaining a release from the squabble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFly, fly, honest man! Here is a convent, there is a church; this way!\r\nthis way!\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted to Renzo from every side. The advice was not\r\nnecessary; from the moment that he conceived the hope of extricating\r\nhimself from the talons of the police, he had determined, if he\r\nsucceeded, to depart immediately, not only from the city, but the\r\ndukedom. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9chowever they may have procured it, they\r\nhave my name on their books; and with name and surname, they will take\r\nme again if they choose to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d As to an asylum, he was determined\r\nnot to have recourse to it, but in the last extremity. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought he, \xe2\x80\x9cif I can be a bird of the woods, I will not be a bird of\r\nthe cage.\xe2\x80\x9d He then determined to seek his cousin Bartolo in the\r\nterritory of Bergamo, who had often urged him to establish himself\r\nthere; but to find the road was the difficulty! In a part of the city\r\nentirely unknown to him, he did not know which gate led to Bergamo; nor\r\nif he had known it, would he have been able to find it. He thought a\r\nmoment of asking directions from his liberators, but he had for some\r\ntime had strange suspicions with regard to the obliging sword-cutler,\r\nfather of four children; so that he did not dare openly declare his\r\ndesign, lest, amidst the crowd, there might be another of the same\r\nstamp. He determined therefore to hasten from this spot, and ask the way\r\nwhen he should arrive at a place where there would be nothing to fear\r\nfrom the curiosity or the character of others. He said to his\r\nliberators, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, a thousand thanks! friends! may Heaven reward you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand quitting the crowd through a passage made for him, he ran down lanes\r\nand narrow streets, without knowing whither.\r\n\r\nWhen he thought himself sufficiently removed from the scene of peril, he\r\nslackened his steps, and began to look around for some countenance which\r\nmight inspire him with confidence enough to make his enquiries. But the\r\nenquiry would of itself be suspicious; time pressed; the police,\r\nrecovering from their fright, would, without doubt, pursue their\r\nfugitive; the noise of his escape might have reached even there; and in\r\nso great a multitude Renzo might pass many judgments in physiognomy\r\nbefore he should find one which seemed favourable. After suffering many\r\nto pass whose appearance was unpropitious, he at last summoned courage\r\nto address a man, who seemed in such haste, that Renzo deemed he would\r\nnot hesitate to answer his questions, in order to get rid of him. \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou be so good, sir, as to tell me through which gate to go to Bergamo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Bergamo? through the eastern gate. Take this street to the left; you\r\nwill come to the square of the cathedral; then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough, sir; I know the way after that; God reward you!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nwent on hastily by the way pointed out to him, and arrived at the square\r\nof the cathedral. He crossed it, passed by the remains of the\r\nextinguished bonfire, at which he had assisted the day before; the\r\nbake-house of the Crutches half demolished, and still guarded by\r\nsoldiers; and finally, reaching the convent of the capuchins, and\r\nlooking at the door of the church, he said to himself, sighing, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nfriar gave me good advice yesterday, when he told me it would be best\r\nfor me to wait patiently in the church.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped a moment, and seeing\r\nthat many persons guarded the gate through which he had to pass, he felt\r\na repugnance to confront them; and hesitated whether it would not be his\r\nwisest plan to seek this asylum and deliver his letter. But he soon\r\nresumed courage, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA bird of the woods as long as I can be. Who\r\nknows me? Certainly the police cannot be waiting for me at all the\r\ngates.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked around, therefore, and perceiving that no one appeared\r\nto notice him, and, whistling as he went, as if from carelessness, he\r\napproached the gate. A company of custom-house officers, with a\r\nreinforcement of Spanish soldiers, were stationed precisely at its\r\nentrance, to keep out persons from abroad, who might be attracted, by\r\nthe noise of the tumult, to rush into the city; their attention was\r\ntherefore directed beyond the gate, and Renzo, taking advantage of this,\r\ncontrived, with a quiet and demure look, to pass through, as if he were\r\nsome peaceful traveller; but his heart beat violently. He pursued a path\r\non the right, to avoid the high road, and for some distance did not dare\r\nto look behind him.\r\n\r\nOn! on! he passed hamlets and villages, without asking the name of them;\r\nhoping that, whilst he was removing from Milan, he was approaching\r\nBergamo. He looked behind him from time to time, while pressing onwards,\r\nand rubbing first one wrist, then the other, which bore the red marks\r\nfrom the painful pressure of the manacles. His thoughts were a confused\r\nmedley of repentance, anxiety, and resentment; and he wearily retraced\r\nthe circumstances of the preceding night, to ascertain what had plunged\r\nhim into these difficulties, and above all, how they came to know his\r\nname. His suspicions rested on the cutler, whose curiosity he well\r\nremembered, and he had also a confused recollection that after his\r\ndeparture he had continued to talk, but with whom, his memory did not\r\nserve to inform him. The poor fellow was lost in these speculations; the\r\npast was a chaos.\r\n\r\nHe then endeavoured to form some plan for the future; but all other\r\nconsiderations were soon swallowed up in the necessity which he was\r\nunder of ascertaining the road; and to do this, he was obliged to\r\naddress himself to some one. He was reluctant to name Bergamo, lest it\r\nmight excite suspicion: why it should, he knew not; but his mind was a\r\nprey to vague apprehensions of evil. However, he could not do otherwise;\r\nand, as at Milan, he accosted the first passenger whose appearance\r\npromised favourably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are out of the road,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the traveller; and directed him to a\r\npath by which he might regain the high road. Renzo thanked him, and\r\nfollowed the direction, with the intention, however, of keeping the high\r\nroad in sight, without exposing himself to hazard by travelling on it.\r\nThe project was more easily conceived than executed; in pursuing a\r\nzigzag course, from right to left, and left to right, and endeavouring\r\nstill to keep the general direction of the way, he had probably\r\ntraversed twelve miles, when he was only six miles from Milan; and as to\r\nBergamo, it was a chance if he was not farther from it, than when he\r\nbegan his journey. He reflected that this would never do, and he must\r\nseek some other expedient; that which occurred to him, was to inform\r\nhimself of the name of some village near the frontier, which he would\r\nreach by crossroads, and asking the way to that, be enabled to avoid the\r\nmention of this dreaded Bergamo, which seemed to him so likely to cause\r\ndistrust and suspicion.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was reflecting on the best method of pursuing this plan\r\nwithout awakening conjectures, he saw a green branch hanging from the\r\ndoor of a lonely cottage, some distance beyond a village; and as he had\r\nfor some time felt the need of refreshment, he thought he could now kill\r\ntwo birds with one stone, and therefore entered the humble dwelling.\r\nThere was no one within, but an old woman, with her distaff by her\r\nside, and spindle in her hand. He asked for a mouthful to eat; she\r\noffered him some _stracchino_[27], and some wine. He accepted the food,\r\nbut refused the wine; of which he felt an intuitive horror since the\r\nevents of the preceding night. The old woman then began to assail her\r\nguest with enquiries of his trade, his journey, and of the news from\r\nMilan, of the disturbances of which she had heard some rumours. To her\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to go to many\r\nplaces, but if I find a moment of time, I should like to stop awhile at\r\nthe village on the road to Bergamo, near the frontier, but in the\r\nterritory of Milan\xe2\x80\x94what do they call it?\xe2\x80\x94There must be some village\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\r\n\r\n      [27] A kind of soft cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGorgonzola, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGorgonzola,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Renzo, as if to fix it in his memory, \xe2\x80\x9cis it far\r\nfrom here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know for certain; perhaps ten or twelve miles. If one of my\r\nchildren were here, they could tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you think I could reach there by keeping on these pleasant\r\npaths, without taking the high road, where there is so much dust? such a\r\nquantity of dust! It is so long since we have had any rain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you can. You can ask at the first village to the\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94naming it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, carrying off the remains of his bread, which\r\nwas much coarser than what he had lately eaten from the foot of the\r\nCross of St. Dionysius; and paying the bill, departed. He took the road\r\nto the right, and with the name of Gorgonzola in his mouth, from village\r\nto village, he succeeded in reaching it an hour before sunset.\r\n\r\nHe had on his way intended to halt here for some more substantial\r\nrefreshment; he felt also the need of sleep; but rather than indulge\r\nhimself in this, he would have dropped dead on the road. His design was\r\nto inform himself, at the inn, of the distance from the Adda, to\r\ncontrive to obtain some direction to the cross paths which led to it,\r\nand after having eaten, to go on his way. Born at the second source of\r\nthis river, he had often heard that at a certain point, and for some\r\ndistance, its waters marked the confines of the Milanese and Venetian\r\nstates. He had no precise idea of the spot where this boundary\r\ncommenced, but, at this time, the principal matter was to reach the\r\nriver. Provided he could not accomplish it by daylight, he decided to\r\ntravel as long as the darkness and his strength would permit, and then\r\nto wait the approach of day in a field, among brambles, or any where,\r\nwhere it should please God, an inn excepted. After advancing a few steps\r\nin Gorgonzola, he saw a sign, and entering the house, asked the host for\r\na mouthful to eat, and a half-pint of wine, his horror of which had been\r\nsubdued by his excessive fatigue. \xe2\x80\x9cI pray you to be in haste,\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I must continue my journey immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d And he said this, not only\r\nbecause it was the truth, but from fear that the host, imagining he was\r\ngoing to lodge there, might ask him his _name_, _surname_, and _whence\r\nhe came_, and _what was his business_!\r\n\r\nThe host replied that he should have what he requested, and Renzo seated\r\nhimself at the end of a bench near the door.\r\n\r\nThere were in the room some idle people of the neighbourhood, who, after\r\nhaving discussed the great news from Milan of the preceding day,\r\nwondered how affairs were going on; as the circumstances of the\r\nrebellion had left their curiosity unsatisfied as to its termination; a\r\nsedition neither suppressed nor successful; suspended rather than\r\nterminated; an unfinished work; the end of an act rather than of a\r\ndrama. One of them detached himself from the company, and, approaching\r\nthe new-comer, asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he came from Milan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou; if the enquiry be lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo, contracting his mouth, made a sort of inarticulate sound, \xe2\x80\x9cMilan,\r\nfrom what I hear\xe2\x80\x94from what they say\xe2\x80\x94is not a place where one would go\r\nnow, unless necessity required it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tumult continues, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must have been on the spot, to know if it were so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you not come from Milan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from Liscate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the youth, who, in the mean while had\r\nprepared his answer. He had, indeed, come from that place, as he had\r\npassed through it. He had learned its name from a traveller who had\r\nmentioned it, as the first village on his road to Gorgonzola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said his interrogator, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had come from Milan. But\r\npatience\xe2\x80\x94and did you hear nothing from Milan at Liscate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very possible that others knew something,\xe2\x80\x9d replied our\r\nmountaineer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have heard nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inquisitive person rejoined his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it from this to the Adda?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo to the host, in a low\r\ncareless tone, as he set before him something to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Adda? to cross the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94to the Adda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you cross the bridge of Cassano, or the ferry of Canonica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x94I ask simply from curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I name them because they are the places chosen by honest people,\r\nwho are willing to give an account of themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right. And how far are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be about six miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix miles! I did not know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resuming an air of\r\nindifference, \xe2\x80\x9cif one wished to shorten the distance, are there not\r\nother places, where one might cross?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host, looking at him with an expression of\r\nmalignant curiosity, which restrained Renzo from any further enquiry. He\r\ndrew the dish towards him, and looking at the decanter the host had put\r\non the table, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this wine pure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs gold. Ask all the inhabitants of the village, and hereabouts. But\r\nyou can judge yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he joined the other customers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse the hosts!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, in his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more I know of them,\r\nthe worse I find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to eat, listening at the same time to the conversation, to\r\nlearn what was thought, in this place, of the events in which he had\r\nacted so principal a part; and also to discover if there were not some\r\nhonest man among the company, of whom a poor youth might ask his way\r\nwithout fear of being compelled in return to tell his business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow, at the latest, we shall know something from\r\nMilan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I did not go to Milan this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will go to-morrow, I will go with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said two or three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which I wish to know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the first speaker, \xe2\x80\x9cis, if these\r\ngentlemen of Milan will think of poor people abroad, or if they will\r\nonly think of obtaining advantages for themselves. You know how they\r\nare. The citizens are proud\xe2\x80\x94they think only of themselves; the\r\nvillagers are treated as if they were not Christians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have mouths also, to eat, and to give our reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said another in\r\na voice as timid as the remark was daring, \xe2\x80\x9cand since the thing has\r\nbegun\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But he did not think to finish his sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not only in Milan, that they conceal grain,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, with a\r\nmysterious air\xe2\x80\x94when suddenly they heard approaching the trampling of a\r\nhorse. They ran to the door, and recognising the person who arrived,\r\nthey went out to receive him. It was a merchant of Milan, who, going\r\nfrequently to Bergamo on business, was accustomed to pass the night at\r\nthis inn, and as he had almost always found there the same company, he\r\nhad formed an acquaintance with all of them. They crowded around\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94one held the bridle, another the stirrup. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am glad to find you all here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you made a good journey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. And you all, how do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well. What news from Milan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there is great news truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the merchant, dismounting, and\r\nleaving his horse in the care of a boy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, entering\r\nthe house with the company, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you know by this time better than I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, we know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x94Well, you will hear fine news, or rather bad news. Eh!\r\nhost! is my bed unoccupied? It is well. A glass of wine, and my usual\r\ndish. Quick, quick! because I must go to bed early, in order to rise\r\nearly, as I must be at Bergamo to dinner. And you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he, seating\r\nhimself at the table opposite to Renzo, who continued silent and\r\nattentive, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know nothing of the mischief of yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard about yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that you must have heard it, being here always on guard to watch\r\ntravellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to-day? What has been done to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! to-day! Then you know nothing of to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all. No one has passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me wet my lips, and I will tell you what has happened to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe filled the glass, swallowed its contents, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day, my\r\ndear friends, little was wanting to make the tumult worse than\r\nyesterday. And I can hardly believe that I am here to tell you, for I\r\nhad nearly given up all thoughts of coming, that I might stay to guard\r\nmy shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the matter, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his auditors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the matter? I will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d And beginning to eat, he at the\r\nsame time pursued his relation; the company standing on his right and\r\nleft, listened with open mouths and ears. Renzo, without appearing to\r\nhear him, was, in fact, the most attentive of all; and ate his last\r\nmouthful very, very slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, then, those vagabonds who\r\nmade such a hurly-burly yesterday, met at the points agreed on, and\r\nbegan to run from street to street, sending forth cries in order to\r\ncollect a crowd. You know it is with such people, as when one sweeps a\r\nhouse; the more you sweep, the more dirt you have. When they thought\r\nthere were people enough, they approached the house of the\r\nsuperintendant of provision, as if the atrocities they committed\r\nyesterday were not enough, to a gentleman of his character. Oh! the\r\nrascals! And the abuse they bestowed on him! All invention and\r\nfalsehood: he is a worthy punctual man; I can say it, for I know; and I\r\nfurnish him cloth for his liveries. They hurried then towards his\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94such a mob! such faces! They passed before my shop. Such\r\nfaces\xe2\x80\x94the Jews of the _Via Crucis_ are nothing to them. And the\r\nblasphemies they uttered! enough to make one stop one\xe2\x80\x99s ears, had it not\r\nbeen for fear of observation. Their intention was to plunder, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut?\xe2\x80\x9d said they all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they found the street barricadoed, and a company of musketeers on\r\nguard. When they saw this ceremony\xe2\x80\x94what would you have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; and that is precisely what they did. But see if the devil\r\ndid not carry them there. When they came on the Cordusio, they saw the\r\nbaker that they had wanted to plunder the day before; and what do you\r\nthink they were doing at this baker\xe2\x80\x99s? They were distributing bread to\r\npurchasers; the first gentlemen of the land were there, watching over\r\nits distribution. The mob, instigated by the devil, rushed upon them\r\nfuriously, and, in the twinkling of an eye, gentlemen, bakers,\r\npurchasers, bread, counters, benches, loaves, bags, flour, all\r\ntopsy-turvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the musketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe musketeers had the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s house to guard. One can\xe2\x80\x99t sing and carry\r\nthe cross too. It was done in the twinkling of an eye, I say. Plunder,\r\nplunder; every thing was carried off. And then they proposed the\r\namusement of yesterday, to burn what remained, in the square, and make a\r\nbonfire. And immediately they began, the rascals! to drag every thing\r\nout of the house, when one among them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Guess what fine proposal he\r\nmade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! to gather every thing in the shop in a heap, and set fire to it\r\nand the shop at the same time. No sooner said than done\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they set fire to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit. An honest man in the neighbourhood had an inspiration from\r\nHeaven. He ran into the house, ascended the stairs, took a crucifix, and\r\nhung it in front of a window; took from the head of the bed two wax\r\ncandles which had been blessed, lit them, and placed them right and left\r\nof the crucifix. The crowd looked up; there is a little fear of God yet,\r\nin Milan, it must be confessed; the crowd retired\xe2\x80\x94a few would have been\r\nsacrilegious enough to set fire to paradise itself; but seeing the rest\r\nnot of their opinion, they were obliged to be quiet. Guess what happened\r\nthen! All the lords of the cathedral in procession, with the cross\r\nelevated, and in pontifical robes; and my lord the arch-priest began to\r\npreach on one side, and my lord the _penitenziere_ on the other, and\r\nthen others here and there: \xe2\x80\x98_But, honest people, what would you do? Is\r\nthis the example you set to your children? Return to your homes; you\r\nshall have bread at a fair price; you can see, yourselves, the rate is\r\naffixed at every corner!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you doubt it? Do you think the lords of the cathedral would come in\r\ntheir robes and declare falsehoods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the people do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy little and little they dispersed; they ran to the corners of the\r\nstreets; the rate was there for those who knew how to read. Eight ounces\r\nof bread for a penny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vine is fine, if its fruitfulness continues. Do you know how much\r\nflour has been consumed since yesterday? As much as would supply the\r\ndukedom two months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have they made no good law for us country people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they have done at Milan is for the city alone. I know not what to\r\ntell you; for you, it must be as God shall direct. The tumult has\r\nentirely ceased for the present; I have not told you all yet. Here is\r\nthe best\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is there any thing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday evening, or this morning, they have arrested some of the\r\nleaders, and they have been told that four will be hung. Hardly was this\r\nknown, when every one betook himself home by the shortest road, so as\r\nnot to be the fifth. Milan, when I left it, resembled a convent of\r\nmonks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will they really hang them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, and very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will the people do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people will go to see them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the merchant. \xe2\x80\x9cThey desired so\r\nmuch to see a man hung, that the rascals were about to satisfy their\r\ncuriosity on the superintendent of provision. They will see instead,\r\nfour rogues, accompanied by capuchins and friars of the _buona\r\nmorte_[28]; well, they have richly deserved it. It is a providence, you\r\nsee; it was a necessary thing. They had begun to enter the shops, and\r\ntake what they wanted, without putting their hand to their purse. If\r\nthey had been suffered to go on their own way, after bread, it would\r\nhave been wine, and then something else\xe2\x80\x94and I assure you, as an honest\r\nman, keeping a shop, it was not a very agreeable idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      [28] Good death. A confraternity which exists under\r\n      the same name in the south of France.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his auditors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly not,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the others in chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the merchant, \xe2\x80\x9cit had been in preparation a long while.\r\nThere was a league, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA league!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA league. Cabals instigated by the Navarrese, by that cardinal of\r\nFrance, you know, who has a half-barbarous name, and who every day\r\noffers some new affront to the crown of Spain. But he aims chiefly at\r\nMilan, because he knows, the knave, that the strength of the king lies\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have a proof of it? Those who made the most noise were\r\nstrangers; people who were never seen before in Milan. I have forgotten,\r\nafter all, to tell you something I heard; one of these had been caught\r\nin an inn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this chord was touched, poor Renzo felt a cold shiver, and could\r\nwith difficulty conceal his agitation. No one however perceived it, and\r\nthe orator proceeded:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not yet know whence he came, by whom he was sent, nor what kind\r\nof man he was; but he was certainly one of the leaders. Yesterday, in\r\nthe height of the tumult, he played the devil; then, not content with\r\nthat, he began to exhort, and propose a fine thing truly! to murder all\r\nthe lords! Rascal! how would poor people live, if the lords were killed?\r\nHe was taken, however, and they found on him an enormous packet of\r\nletters, after which they were taking him to prison. But what do you\r\nthink? his companions, who were keeping watch round the inn, came in\r\ngreat force, and delivered him. The rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not known. He has escaped, or is concealed in Milan. These people\r\nfind lodging and concealment any where, although they have neither house\r\nnor home of their own. The devil helps them; but they are sometimes\r\ntaken in the snare, when they least expect it. When the pear is ripe, it\r\nmust fall. It is well known that these letters are in the hands of\r\ngovernment, that they contain an account of the whole plot, that many\r\npeople are implicated, that they have turned the city upside down, and\r\nwould have done much worse. Some say the bakers are rogues, and so say\r\nI: but they ought to be hanged at least in a legal manner. There\r\ncertainly is corn concealed; and the government ought to have spies and\r\nfind it out, and hang up all that keep it back in company with the\r\nbakers; and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, all the city ought to remonstrate again and\r\nagain, but never allow the villainous practice of entering shops and\r\nwarehouses for plunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little that Renzo had eaten had become poison. It appeared like an\r\nage before he dared rise to quit. He felt nailed to the spot. To have\r\nmoved from the inn and the village, in the midst of the conversation,\r\nwould have incurred suspicion. He determined to wait till the babbler\r\nshould cease to speak of him and apply to some other subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the company, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have some experience, know that a\r\ntumult like this is no place for an honest man; therefore I have not\r\nsuffered my curiosity to conquer me, and have remained quietly at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did I move?\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d added a third, \xe2\x80\x9cif by any chance I had been at Milan, I would\r\nhave left my business unfinished, and returned home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the host approached the corner of the table, to see how\r\nthe stranger came on. Renzo gathered courage to speak, asked for his\r\nbill, settled it, and rapidly crossed the threshold, trusting himself to\r\nthe guardian care of a kind Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discourse of the merchant had plunged our poor Renzo into\r\ninexpressible agitation and alarm; there was no doubt that his adventure\r\nwas noised abroad\xe2\x80\x94that people were in search of him? Who could tell how\r\nmany bailiffs were in pursuit of him? Who could tell what orders had\r\nbeen given to watch at the villages, inns, and along the roads? True it\r\nwas, that two only of the officers were acquainted with his person, and\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t bear his name stamped on his forehead. Yet he had heard\r\nstrange stories of fugitives being discovered by their suspicious air,\r\nor some unexpected mark; in short, he was alarmed at every shadow.\r\n\r\nAlthough at the moment he quitted Gorgonzola, the bells struck the _Ave\r\nMaria_, and the increasing darkness diminished his danger, he\r\nunwillingly took the high road, with the intention, however, of entering\r\nthe first path which should appear to him to lead in the right\r\ndirection. He met some travellers, but, his imagination filled with\r\napprehensions, he dared not interrogate them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe host called it six\r\nmiles,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cif, in travelling through by-paths, I make it eight or\r\nten, these good limbs will not fail me, I know. I am certainly not going\r\ntowards Milan, and must therefore be approaching the Adda. If I keep\r\non, sooner or later I must arrive there; the Adda has a voice\r\nsufficiently loud to be heard at some distance, and when I hear it,\r\nthere will be no longer any need of direction. If there is a boat there,\r\nI shall cross immediately; if not, I will wait until morning in a field,\r\nupon the ground, like the sparrows, which will be far better than a\r\nprison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw a cross-road open to the left, and he pursued it: \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ play the\r\ndevil!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ assassinate the lords! A packet of letters!\r\nMy companions keeping watch! I would give something to meet this\r\nmerchant face to face, on the other side of the Adda; (Oh! when shall I\r\nreach the beautiful stream?) I would ask him politely where he picked up\r\nthat fine story. Know, my good sir, that, devil as I am, it was I who\r\naided Ferrer, and like a good Christian saved your superintendent of\r\nprovisions from a rough joke that those ruffians, my friends, were about\r\nto play on him. Ay, while you were keeping watch over your shop\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat enormous packet of letters\xe2\x80\x94in the hands of the government. See,\r\nsir, here it is; a single letter, written by a worthy man, a monk; a\r\nhair of whose beard is worth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94but in future learn to speak with more\r\ncharity of your neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d However, after a while, these thoughts of\r\nthe poor traveller gave way to more urgent considerations of his present\r\ndifficulties; he no longer feared pursuit or discovery; but darkness,\r\nsolitude, and fatigue combined to distress him and retard his progress.\r\nA chill north wind penetrated his light clothing, his wedding suit; and,\r\nuncomfortable and disheartened, he wandered on, in hopes of finding some\r\nplace where he might obtain concealment and repose for the night.\r\n\r\nHe passed through villages, but did not dare ask shelter; the dogs\r\nhowled at his approach, and induced him to quicken his steps. At single\r\nhouses near the road-side his fatigue tempted him to knock for shelter;\r\nbut the apprehension of being saluted with the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, thieves!\r\nrobbers!\xe2\x80\x9d banished the idea from his mind. Leaving the cultivated\r\ncountry, he found himself in a plain, covered with fern and broom; and\r\nthinking this a favourable symptom of the near vicinity of the river, he\r\nfollowed the path across it. When he had advanced a few steps, he\r\nlistened, but in vain. The desolation of the place increased the\r\ndepression of his spirits. Strange forms and apparitions, the birth of\r\nformer tales and legends, began to haunt his imagination; and to drive\r\nthem away he began to chant the prayers for the dead. He passed through\r\na thicket of plum-trees and oaks, and found himself on the borders of a\r\nwood; he conquered his repugnance to enter it, but as he proceeded into\r\nits depths, every object excited his apprehensions. Strange forms\r\nappeared beneath the bushes; and the shade of the trees, trembling on\r\nhis moon-lit path, with the crackling of the dead leaves between his\r\nfootsteps, inspired him with dread. He would have hastened through the\r\nperilous passage, but his limbs refused their office; the wind blew cold\r\nand sharp, and penetrating his weakened frame, almost subdued its small\r\nremains of vigour. His senses, affected by undefined horrors, appeared\r\nto be leaving him; aroused to his danger, he made a violent effort to\r\nregain some degree of resolution, in order to return through the wood,\r\nand seek shelter in the last village he had passed through, even if it\r\nshould be in an inn! As he stopped for a moment, before putting his\r\ndesign in execution, the wind brought a new sound to his ear\xe2\x80\x94the murmur\r\nof running water. Intently listening, to ascertain if his senses did not\r\ndeceive him, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Adda!\xe2\x80\x9d His fatigue vanished, his\r\npulse returned, his blood flowed freely through his veins, his fears\r\ndisappeared; and guided by the friendly sound, he went forward. He soon\r\nreached the extremity of the plain, and found himself on the edge of a\r\nsteep precipice, whence looking downward, he discovered, through the\r\nbushes, the long-desired river, and, on the other side of it, villages\r\nscattered here and there, with hills in the distance; and on the summit\r\nof one of these a whitish spot, which in the dimness he took to be a\r\ncity; Bergamo certainly! He descended the declivity, and throwing aside\r\nthe bushes with his hands, looked beyond them, to spy if some friendly\r\nbark were moving on the flood, or if he could not, by listening, hear\r\nthe sound of oars cleaving the water; but he saw, he heard nothing. If\r\nit had been any stream less than the Adda, he would have attempted to\r\nford it, but this he well knew to be impracticable.\r\n\r\nHe was uncertain what plan to pursue: to lie down on the grass for the\r\nnext six hours, and wait until morning, exposed to the north wind and\r\nthe damps of the night; or to continue walking to and fro, to protect\r\nhimself from the cold, until the day should dawn: neither of these held\r\nout much prospect of comfort. He suddenly recollected to have seen, in a\r\nneighbouring part of the uncultivated heath, a _cascinotto_;\xe2\x80\x94this was\r\nthe name given by the peasants of the Milanese to cabins covered with\r\nstraw, constructed with the trunks and branches of trees, and the\r\ncrevices filled with mud, where they were in the habit of placing the\r\ncrop, gathered during the day, until a more convenient opportunity for\r\nremoving it; they were therefore abandoned except at such seasons. Renzo\r\nfound his way thither, pushed open the door, and perceiving a bundle of\r\nstraw on the ground, thought that sleep, even in such a place, would be\r\nvery welcome. Before, however, throwing himself on the bed Providence\r\nhad provided for him, he kneeled, and returned thanks for the blessing,\r\nand for all the assistance which had been this day afforded him, and\r\nthen implored forgiveness for the errors of the previous day; then\r\ngathering the straw around him as some defence against the cold, he\r\nclosed his eyes to sleep; but sleep was not so soon to visit our poor\r\ntraveller. Confused images began to throng his fancy; the merchant, the\r\nnotary, the bailiffs, the cutler, the host, Ferrer, the superintendent,\r\nthe company at the inn, the crowds in the streets, assailed his\r\nimagination by turns; then came the thought of Don Abbondio, Roderick,\r\nLucy, Agnes, and the good friar. He remembered the paternal counsels of\r\nthe latter, and reflected with shame and remorse on his neglect of them;\r\nand what bitter retrospection did the image of Lucy produce! and Agnes!\r\npoor Agnes! how ill had she been repaid for her motherly solicitude on\r\nhis behalf! an outcast from her home, solitary, uncertain of the future,\r\nreaping misery from what seemed to promise the happiness of her\r\ndeclining years! Poor Renzo! what a night didst thou pass! what an\r\napartment! what a bed for a matrimonial couch! tormented, too, with\r\napprehensions of the future! \xe2\x80\x9cI submit to the will of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nspeaking aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cto the will of God! He does only that which is right; I\r\naccept it all as a just chastisement for my sins. Lucy, however, is so\r\ngood! the Lord will not long afflict her with suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he despaired of obtaining any repose; the cold was\r\ninsupportable; his teeth chattered; he ardently wished for day, and\r\nmeasured with impatience the slow progress of the hours; this he was\r\nenabled to do, as he heard, every half hour, in the deep silence, the\r\nheavy sound of some distant clock, probably that of Trezzo. When the\r\ntime arrived which he had fixed on for his departure, half benumbed with\r\nexposure to the night air, he stretched his stiffened limbs, and opening\r\nthe door of the _cascinotto_, looked out, to ascertain if any one were\r\nnear, and finding all silent around, he resumed his journey along the\r\npath he had quitted.\r\n\r\nThe sky announced a beautiful day; the setting moon shone pale in an\r\nimmense field of azure, which, towards the east, mingled itself lightly\r\nwith the rosy dawn. Near the horizon were scattered clouds of various\r\nhues and forms; it was, in fact, the sky of Lombardy, beautiful,\r\nbrilliant, and calm. If Renzo had had a mind at ease, he would no doubt\r\nhave stopped to contemplate this splendid ushering in of day, so\r\ndifferent from that which he had been accustomed to witness amidst his\r\nmountains; but his thoughts were otherwise occupied. He reached the brow\r\nof the precipice where he had stood the preceding night, and looking\r\nbelow, perceived, through the bushes, a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s bark, which was\r\nslowly stemming the current, near the shore. He descended the precipice,\r\nand standing on the bank, made a sign to the fisherman to approach. He\r\nintended to do this with a careless air, as if it were of little\r\nimportance, but in spite of himself, his manner was half supplicatory.\r\nThe fisherman, after having for a moment surveyed the course of the\r\nwater, as if to ascertain the practicability of reaching the shore,\r\ndirected the boat towards it; before it touched the bank, Renzo, who was\r\nstanding on the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, awaiting its approach, seized the prow,\r\nand jumped into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me a service, and I will pay you for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to cross\r\nto the other shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fisherman having divined his object, had already turned his boat in\r\nthat direction. Renzo, perceiving another oar in the bottom of the bark,\r\nstooped to take it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fisherman. But seeing with what skill the\r\nyoung man managed the oar, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know the trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very little,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Renzo, and he continued to row with a vigour\r\nand skill beyond that of a mere amateur in the art. With all his\r\nefforts, however, the bark moved slowly; the current, setting strong\r\nagainst it, drove it continually from the line of its direction, and\r\nimpeded the rapidity of its course. New perplexities presented\r\nthemselves to the mind of Renzo; now that the Adda was almost passed, he\r\nbegan to fear that it might not, at this place, serve for the boundary\r\nbetween the states, and that, this obstacle surmounted, there would yet\r\nbe others remaining. He spoke to the fisherman, and pointing to the\r\nwhite spot he had noticed the night before, and which was now much more\r\ndistinct, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that Bergamo?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe city of Bergamo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the fisherman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other shore, does it belong to Bergamo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the territory of St. Mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live St. Mark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo. The fisherman made no reply.\r\n\r\nThe boat reached the shore, at last; Renzo thanked God in his heart, as\r\nhe stepped upon it; and turning to the fisherman took from his pocket a\r\n_berlinga_ and gave it to him. The man took it in silence, and with a\r\nsignificant look, placed his forefinger on his lip; and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA good\r\njourney to you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned to his employment.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for the prompt and discreet civility of this man\r\ntowards a perfect stranger, we must inform the reader, that he was\r\naccustomed to render similar favours to smugglers and outlaws, not so\r\nmuch for the sake of the little gain which accrued to him thereby, as\r\nnot to create enemies among these classes of people. He rendered these\r\nservices, therefore, when he was sure of not being seen by the\r\ncustom-house officers, bailiffs, or spies. Thus he endeavoured to act\r\nwith an impartiality, which should give offence to neither party.\r\n\r\nRenzo stopped a moment to contemplate the shore he had quitted, and\r\nwhere he had suffered so much; \xe2\x80\x9cI am at last safely beyond it,\xe2\x80\x9d was his\r\nfirst thought; then the remembrance of those he had left behind rushed\r\nover his mind, overwhelming it with regret and shame; for, with the calm\r\nand virtuous image of Lucy, came the recollection of his extravagances\r\nin Milan.\r\n\r\nHe shook off, however, these oppressive thoughts, and went on, taking\r\nthe direction of the whitish mass on the declivity of the mountain,\r\nuntil he should meet some one who could direct him on his way. And now\r\nwith what a different and careless air he accosted travellers! he\r\nhesitated no more, he pronounced boldly the name of the place where his\r\ncousin lived, to ask the way to it; from the information given him by\r\nthe first traveller he met, he found that he had still nine miles to\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nHis journey was not agreeable. Without referring to his own causes of\r\ntrouble, Renzo was affected every moment by the sight of painful and\r\ndistressing objects; so that he foresaw, that he should find in this\r\ncountry the poverty he had left in his own. All along the way he was\r\nassailed by mendicants,\xe2\x80\x94mendicants of necessity, not of\r\nchoice,\xe2\x80\x94peasants, mountaineers, tradesmen, whole families reduced to\r\npoverty, and to the necessity of begging their bread. This sight,\r\nbesides the compassion it excited, made him naturally recur to his own\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cif I shall find work to do?\r\nperhaps things are not as they were in preceding years. Bartolo wishes\r\nme well, I know; he is a good fellow; he has made money; he has invited\r\nme many times to come to him; I am sure he will not abandon me. And then\r\nProvidence has aided me until now; and will continue to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the walk had sharpened his appetite; he could indeed have\r\nwell waited to the end of his journey, which was only two miles farther,\r\nbut he did not like to make his first appearance before his cousin as a\r\nhungry beggar; he therefore drew all his wealth from his pocket, and\r\ncounting it on the palm of his hand, found that he had more than\r\nsufficient to procure a slight repast; after paying for which, he would\r\nstill have a few pence remaining.\r\n\r\nAs he came out of the inn at which he had rested, to proceed on his\r\njourney, he saw, lying near the door, two women: the one was elderly,\r\nand the other more youthful, with an infant in her arms, which was in\r\nvain seeking sustenance from its exhausted mother; both were of the\r\ncomplexion of death: by them stood a man, whose countenance and limbs\r\ngave signs of former vigour; now lost from long inanition. All three\r\nstretched forth their hands, but spoke not\xe2\x80\x94what prayer could be so\r\nmoving as their appearance. Renzo sighed; \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, as he placed in the nearest hand the last remnant of his wealth.\r\n\r\nThe slight repast he had made, and the good deed he had performed (for\r\nwe are composed of body and soul), had equally tended to refresh and\r\ninvigorate him. If, to afford relief to these unhappy persons,\r\nProvidence had kept in reserve the last farthing of a fugitive stranger,\r\nwould he leave the wants of that stranger unsupplied? He looked with\r\nrenewed hope to the future; he pictured to himself the return of\r\nabundant harvests, and in the mean time he had his cousin Bartolo and\r\nhis own industry to depend on, and moreover he had left at home a small\r\nsum of money, the fruit of his economy, which he could send for, if\r\nneeded. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cplenty will eventually return, and trade will\r\nbe profitable again; the Milanese workmen will be in demand, and can set\r\na high price on their labour; I shall have more than enough to satisfy\r\nmy wants, and can lay by money, and can furnish my nice house, and then\r\nwrite to Agnes and Lucy to come\xe2\x80\x94and then\xe2\x80\x94But why wait for this? We\r\nshould have been obliged to live, had we remained at home; we should\r\nhave been obliged to live during this winter, upon my little savings,\r\nand we can do the same here. There are curates every where, and they can\r\ncome shortly. Oh! what joy will it be to walk together on this same\r\nroad; to go to the borders of the Adda, where I will point out to them\r\nthe place where I embarked, the woods through which I passed, the spot\r\nwhere I stood watching for a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached at last the village of his cousin; at its entrance, he saw a\r\nvery high house, with numerous windows, and perceived it to be a silk\r\nmanufactory; he entered, and amidst the noise of the water and\r\nmachinery loudly demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cif Bartolo Castagneri was within?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor Bartolo? there he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor! that\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Renzo. He perceived his cousin,\r\nand ran towards him, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come at last!\xe2\x80\x9d Bartolo made an\r\nexclamation of surprise, and embraced him; he then took him into another\r\nchamber, apart from the noise of the machinery and the notice of the\r\ninquisitive, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you, but you are a droll\r\nfellow. I have invited you many times to come hither; you have always\r\nrefused, and now choose a most unfavourable moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say to you? I have not now come of my own free will,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRenzo; and he briefly, and with much emotion, related the mournful\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another affair truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartolo. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Renzo! you have\r\nrelied on me, and I will not abandon you. To say truth, workmen are not\r\nin much demand at present; and it is with difficulty that those already\r\nengaged are kept by their employers. But my master regards me, and he\r\nhas money; and besides, without boasting, we are equally dependent on\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x94he has the capital, and I the skill, such as it is! I am his\r\nfirst workman, his _factotum_! Poor Lucy Mondella! I remember her as if\r\nit was but yesterday that I last saw her! An excellent girl! always so\r\nmodest at church; and if you passed by her cottage\xe2\x80\x94I see it now, the\r\nlittle cottage beyond the village, with a large fig-tree against the\r\nwall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant to say, that if you passed it, you always heard the noise of\r\nher reel. And Don Roderick! even before I left, showed symptoms of his\r\ncharacter; but now, it seems, he plays the devil outright, until God\r\nshall put a bridle on his neck. Well, as I said, we suffer here also the\r\nconsequences of scarce harvests.\xe2\x80\x94But, apropos, are you not hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not long since I have eaten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are you off for money?\xe2\x80\x9d Renzo extended the palm of his hand and\r\nshook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartolo: \xe2\x80\x9cI have plenty. Cheer up;\r\nthings will change for the better soon, and then you can repay me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a small sum at home, and I will send for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the mean while, depend on me. God has given me wealth to spend\r\nfor others, and above all, for my relations and friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that you would befriend me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, affectionately pressing\r\nhis cousin\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what a fuss they have made at Milan,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bartolo; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\npeople seem to me to be mad. The report has reached us, but I shall be\r\nglad to know the particulars from you. I think we shall have enough to\r\ntalk about, shall we not? Here, however, things are conducted with more\r\njudgment. The city purchased two thousand loads of corn from a merchant\r\nof Venice; the corn comes from Turkey. Now, what do you think happened?\r\nThe governors of Verona and Brescia forbade the transit of the corn.\r\nWhat did the people of Bergamo do then, do you think? They sent to\r\nVenice a man that knew how to talk, I can tell you: he went to the doge,\r\nand made a speech which they say deserves to be printed! Immediately an\r\norder was sent to let the corn pass: the governors were obliged to obey.\r\nThe country, too, has been thought of. Another good man informed the\r\nsenate that the people here were famishing, and the senate granted us\r\nfour thousand bushels of millet, which makes very good bread. And then,\r\nif there is no bread, you and I can eat meat; God has given me wealth I\r\ntell you. Now I will conduct you to my patron. I have often spoken of\r\nyou to him; he will make you welcome. He is a native of Bergamo, a man\r\nof an excellent disposition. \xe2\x80\x99Tis true, he did not expect you at this\r\ntime, but when he learns your story\xe2\x80\x94And then he knows how to value\r\nskilful workmen, because scarcity lasts but a little while, and business\r\nmust finally go on.\xe2\x80\x94But I must hint to you one thing; do you know what\r\nname they give to us Milanese in this country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name they give us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey call us simpletons.\xe2\x80\x9d[29]\r\n\r\n      [29] Baggiani.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is certainly not a very agreeable name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it? Whoever is born in the territory of Milan, and would\r\ngain his living in that of Bergamo, must put up with it. As to the\r\npeople here, they call a Milanese a simpleton as freely as they call a\r\ngentleman _sir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say so, I suppose, to those who will suffer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, if you are not disposed to submit to be called\r\nsimpleton, till it becomes familiar to your taste, you must not expect\r\nto live in Bergamo. You would always be obliged to carry your knife in\r\nhand; and when you had killed three or four, you might be killed\r\nyourself, and have to appear before the bar of God with three or four\r\nmurders to answer for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a Milanese who understands his trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same; he would still be a simpleton. Do you know how my\r\nmaster expresses himself when he talks of me to his friends? _Heaven has\r\nsent me this simpleton to carry on my business. If it were not for this\r\nsimpleton I should never get on._ It is the custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a silly custom, to say the least of it; and especially as it is\r\nwe who have brought the art hither, and who carry it on. Is it possible\r\nthat there is no remedy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. Time may accomplish it. The next generation may be different, but\r\nat present we must submit. And after all, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if there is no other evil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! now that you are convinced, all will be well. Let us go to my\r\nmaster. Be of good courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the promises of Bartolo were realised, and all _was_ well. It\r\nwas truly a kind Providence; for we shall see how little dependence\r\nRenzo could place on the treasure he had left at home,\xe2\x80\x94the savings of\r\nhis labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this same day, the 13th of November, there arrived a courier\r\nextraordinary to the signor _podest\xc3\xa0_ of Lecco. The courier brought an\r\nexpress from the head of the police, containing an order to make every\r\npossible search for a young man of the name of Lorenzo Tramaglino, silk\r\nweaver, who, having escaped from the hands \xe2\x80\x9c_of the illustrious head\r\nabove cited_,\xe2\x80\x9d had probably returned to the territory of Lecco. That, in\r\ncase of his discovery, he should be committed to prison, and an account\r\nrendered to the police of his wicked practices, his ostensible means of\r\nprocuring subsistence, and his accomplices. And furthermore, that an\r\nexecution should be put into the house of the above-said Lorenzo\r\nTramaglino, and every thing taken from thence that might aid in throwing\r\nlight on his nefarious deeds.\r\n\r\nThe signor podest\xc3\xa0, after ascertaining as well as he could, that Renzo\r\nhad not returned to the village, took with him the constable of the\r\nplace, and obeyed these injunctions, accompanied by a large escort of\r\nnotary, constable, and officers. The key of the house was not to be\r\nfound; the door was accordingly forced. The report of this transaction\r\nspread around, and soon reached the ears of Father Christopher. The good\r\nman was surprised and afflicted; and not being able to gain satisfactory\r\ninformation with regard to Renzo, he wrote to the Father Bonaventura for\r\nintelligence concerning him. In the mean while the relations and friends\r\nof Renzo were summoned to give in their testimony, with regard to his\r\ndepravity of character. To bear the name of Tramaglino became a\r\ndisgrace; the village was all in commotion. By little and little, it was\r\nunderstood that Renzo had escaped from the hands of justice, even in the\r\nheart of Milan, and had disappeared: it was whispered that he had\r\ncommitted some enormous crime, the nature of which remained unknown.\r\nThe more enormous, however, the less it was believed, for Renzo was\r\nknown by every body to be a worthy youth; the greatest number thought,\r\ntherefore, that it was a machination of Don Roderick to ruin his poor\r\nrival. Thus it is true, that judging from inference, and without the\r\nindispensable knowledge of facts, we often wrongfully suspect even the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nBut we, who have the facts in our hands, can affirm, that if Don\r\nRoderick had no share in creating these misfortunes, he rejoiced in them\r\nas if they had been his own work; and made them a subject of merriment\r\nwith his friends, and above all with Count Attilio, who had been\r\ndeterred from prosecuting his intended journey to Milan by the account\r\nreceived of the disturbances there: but this order from the police gave\r\nhim to understand that things had resumed their usual course. He then\r\ndetermined to depart immediately, and, exhorting his cousin to persist\r\nin his undertaking, and to surmount every obstacle, he promised to use\r\nhis efforts to rid him of the friar. Attilio had hardly taken his\r\ndeparture, when Griso arrived, safe and sound, from Monza, and gave in\r\nhis report to his master of all he had been able to collect. He told him\r\nthat Lucy had been taken into the convent under the protection of the\r\nsignora; that she lived there as secluded as if she were a nun, never\r\nputting her foot without the walls; that she assisted at the ceremonies\r\nof the church behind a grated window; and that it was impossible to\r\nobtain a view of her.\r\n\r\nThis relation put the devil into Roderick, or rather rendered the one\r\nmore uncontrollable that sojourned there already. So many favourable\r\ncircumstances concurring to forward his designs, inflamed the medley of\r\nspleen, rage, and infamous desire, which he dignified by the name of\r\nlove. Renzo absent, expelled, banished, every measure against him became\r\nlawful; his betrothed herself might be considered in some sort as the\r\nproperty of a rebel. The only man who could and would take her under his\r\nprotection, the friar, would soon be deprived of the power to do so;\r\nbut, amidst so many unlooked-for facilities, one obstacle appeared to\r\nrender them unavailable. A monastery of Monza, even if there were no\r\n_signora_ there, was an obstacle not to be surmounted even by Don\r\nRoderick. He in vain wandered, in his imagination, around this asylum,\r\nnot being able to devise any means of violating it, either by force or\r\nintrigue. He was upon the point of renouncing the enterprise, of going\r\nto Milan, of mixing in its pleasures, and thus drowning all remembrance\r\nof Lucy; but, in place of relief, would he not find there fresh food for\r\nvexation? Attilio had certainly told the story, and every one would ask\r\nhim about the mountain girl! What reply would he be obliged to give? He\r\nhad been outwitted by a capuchin and a clown; and, moreover, when a\r\nhappy unexpected chance had rid him of the one, and a skilful friend\r\nremoved the other, then he, like a simpleton, abandoned the undertaking!\r\nThere was enough in this to prevent his ever lifting up his head in the\r\nsociety of his equals; or else to compel him to go among them sword in\r\nhand! And on the other hand, how could he return and remain in this\r\nspot, where he would be tormented by the remembrance of his passion, and\r\nthe disgrace of its failure. How resolve? What do? Shall he go forward?\r\nShall he draw back? A means presented itself to his mind, by which his\r\nenterprise might succeed. This was to call to his aid the assistance of\r\na man whose power could accomplish whatever he thought fit to undertake,\r\nand for whom the difficulty of an enterprise would be only an additional\r\nmotive for engaging in it. But this project had nevertheless its\r\ninconveniences and dangers, the consequences of which it was impossible\r\nto calculate. No one could foresee the termination of an affair, when\r\nthey had once embarked in it with this man; a powerful auxiliary,\r\nassuredly, but a guide not less absolute than dangerous. Such\r\nreflections kept Don Roderick many days in a state of painful\r\nirresolution: he received, in the meanwhile, a letter from his cousin,\r\ninforming him that the intrigue was prospering. After the lightning came\r\nthe thunder. One fine morning he heard that Father Christopher had left\r\nthe convent of Pescarenico! Such complete and prompt success, and the\r\nletter of Attilio, who encouraged him by his advice and vexed him by his\r\njokes, inclined him to hazard every thing; and what above all confirmed\r\nhim in his intention, was the unexpected intelligence that Agnes had\r\nreturned to the village, and was at her own house! We will relate these\r\ntwo events for the information of the reader.\r\n\r\nLucy and her mother had hardly entered their asylum, when the news of\r\nthe terrible insurrection at Milan spread through Monza, and even\r\npenetrated the walls of the convent. The accounts were various and\r\ncontradictory.\r\n\r\nThe portress, who from necessity went much abroad, heard all the news,\r\nand related them to her guests. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have put several in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe; \xe2\x80\x9csome were taken before the bakers of the Crutches, others in front\r\nof the house inhabited by the superintendant of provision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But listen\r\nto this; there was one who escaped, who was from Lecco, or thereabouts.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know his name, but I will ascertain it from some one; perhaps\r\nyou may know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis intelligence, joined to the circumstance that Renzo must have\r\narrived in Milan precisely on this fatal day, gave some uneasiness to\r\nLucy and her mother; judge what must have been their feelings, when the\r\nportress came again to tell them, \xe2\x80\x9cHe that fled to avoid hanging is from\r\nyour village, a silk weaver, one Tramaglino. Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy was seated, busy at her work; it fell from her hands; she turned\r\npale, and her emotion must certainly have attracted the attention of the\r\nportress, had she not been too eagerly engaged in delivering her report\r\nto Agnes, who was standing by the door at some distance from the poor\r\ngirl. Agnes, notwithstanding she was much agitated, avoided any\r\nexhibition of her feelings. She made an effort to reply, that in a small\r\nvillage every one was known, but she could hardly believe this to be\r\ntrue of Tramaglino, as he was a quiet worthy youth. She asked if it was\r\ntrue that he had escaped, and if it was known where he was?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscaped, he certainly has, for every one knows it; but where, no one\r\nknows. Perhaps they may take him again, perhaps he is in safety; but if\r\nyour peaceful youth falls into their hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere very fortunately the portress was called away; you may imagine the\r\nfeelings of Agnes and her daughter! The poor woman and the desolate Lucy\r\nremained more than a day in cruel uncertainty, imagining the details and\r\nthe probable consequences of this unhappy event. Tormented with vain\r\nhopes and anxious fears, their only relief was in each other\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy.\r\n\r\nAt length, a man arrived at the convent, and asked to see Agnes; he was\r\na fishmonger of Pescarenico, who was going, according to custom, to\r\nMilan, to sell his fish; the good Christopher had desired him to stop at\r\nthe convent, to relate what he knew of the unhappy affair of Renzo to\r\nLucy and her mother, and exhort them, in his name, to have patience and\r\nto confide in God. As for him, he should certainly not forget them, and\r\nwould seize every possible opportunity to aid them; in the meanwhile he\r\nwould not fail to send them news every week, by this or some other\r\nmeans. All that the messenger could tell them further of Renzo was, that\r\nit was considered certain that he had taken refuge in Bergamo. Such a\r\ncertainty was a great balm to the affliction of Lucy; her tears flowed\r\nless bitterly, and she experienced some comfort in discoursing upon it\r\nwith her mother; and they united in heartfelt thanks to the Great Being\r\nwho had saved them from so many dangers.\r\n\r\nGertrude made Lucy often visit her in her private parlour, and conversed\r\nmuch with her, finding a charm in the ingenuousness and sweetness of the\r\npoor girl, and delighted with listening to expressions of gratitude from\r\nher mouth. She changed insensibly the suspicions of Lucy with regard to\r\nher into a sentiment of the deepest compassion, by relating to her, in\r\nconfidence, a part of her history, that part of it which she dared avow.\r\nLucy found in the relation reasons more than sufficient to explain what\r\nhad appeared strange in the manners of her benefactress. She was very\r\ncareful, however, not to return the confidence Gertrude placed in her,\r\nby speaking of her new fears and misfortunes, lest she should thereby\r\nextend the knowledge of Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s supposed crime and disgrace. She avoided\r\nas much as possible replying to the repeated enquiries of the signora on\r\nthat part of her history, which preceded the promise of marriage; to\r\nher modesty and innocence it appeared an impossible thing to converse\r\nfreely on such a subject. Gertrude was often tempted to quarrel with her\r\nshyness, but how could she? Lucy was nevertheless so respectful, so\r\ngrateful, so trusting! Sometimes her shrinking and susceptible modesty\r\nmight displease her, from other motives; but all was lost in the\r\nsweetness of the thought that to Lucy, if to no other human being, she\r\nwas doing good. And this was true; for besides the asylum she afforded\r\nher, her conversation and endearments encouraged the timid mind of the\r\nmaiden; whose only other resource was constant employment. The nuns, at\r\nher solicitation, furnished her with occupation; and, as from morning\r\ntill night she plied her needle, her reel, her beloved but now forsaken\r\nreel, recurred to her memory, bringing with it a throng of painful\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\nThe following week another message was received from Father Christopher,\r\nconfirming the flight of Renzo, but with regard to the extent or nature\r\nof his misdemeanor, there was no further information. The friar had\r\nhoped for satisfaction on this point from his brother at Milan, to whom\r\nhe had recommended him; but had received for answer that he had neither\r\nseen the young man, nor received the letter; that some one from abroad\r\nhad been at the convent to ask for him, and not finding him there, had\r\ngone away.\r\n\r\nThe third week there was no messenger, which not only deprived them of a\r\ndesired and expected consolation, but also produced a thousand uneasy\r\nsuspicions. Before this, Agnes had thought of taking a journey home, and\r\nthis disappointment confirmed her resolution. Lucy was unwilling to be\r\nseparated from her mother, but her anxiety to gain more satisfactory\r\nintelligence of Renzo, and the security she felt in her sacred asylum,\r\nreconciled her. It was therefore agreed between them, that Agnes should\r\nwait on the road the following day for the return of the fishmonger from\r\nMilan, and should ask the favour of a seat in his cart, in order to go\r\nto her mountains. Upon seeing him approach, therefore, she asked him if\r\nFather Christopher had not sent any message by him. The fishmonger had\r\nbeen occupied the whole day before his departure in fishing, and had\r\nreceived no message from the friar! She then preferred her request, and\r\nhaving obtained a compliance with it, bade farewell to her daughter and\r\nthe signora, promising a speedy return.\r\n\r\nThe journey was without accident; early in the morning they arrived at\r\nPescarenico. Here Agnes took leave of her conductor, with many thanks\r\nfor the obligation he had conferred on her; and as she was before the\r\nconvent gates, she determined to speak with the good friar before she\r\nproceeded homeward. She pulled the bell\xe2\x80\x94the friar Galdino, whom we may\r\nremember as the nut collector, appeared to answer it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! good dame, what good wind brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come to see Father Christopher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Christopher? He is not here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? will it be long before he returns? Where is he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Rimini.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Rimini.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! eh! eh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friar, extending his arms, as if to indicate a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable that I am! But why did he go so suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the father provincial would have it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did they send away one who did so much good here? Oh! unhappy\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf our superiors were obliged to give reasons for what they do, where\r\nwould be our obedience, my good woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is such a loss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you how it has happened? they have probably wanted a good\r\npreacher at Rimini; (we have them in every place to be sure, but\r\nsometimes a particular man is needed;) the father provincial of that\r\nplace has written to the father provincial of this, to know if there\r\nwere such a person in this convent; the father provincial returned for\r\nanswer, that there was none but Father Christopher who corresponded to\r\nthe description.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! unfortunate! When did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if I had only come a few days sooner, as I wished to do! And do\r\nthey not know when he will return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! my dear woman! the father provincial knows, if any one does; but\r\nwhen one of our preachers has taken his flight, it is impossible to say\r\non what branch he will rest. They want him here; they want him there;\r\nfor we have convents in the four quarters of the world. Father\r\nChristopher will make a great noise at Rimini, with his Lent sermon; the\r\nfame of this great preacher will resound every where, and it is our duty\r\nto give him up, because we live on the charity of others, and it is but\r\nright we should serve all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! misery! misery!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Agnes, weeping; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall I do without\r\nthis good man? He was a father to us; what a loss! what a loss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, good woman\xe2\x80\x94Father Christopher was truly a good man, but we\r\nhave others equally so; there is Father Antanasio, Father Girolamo,\r\nFather Zaccaria! Father Zaccaria is a worthy man! And you must not\r\nwonder, as some ignorant people do, at his shrill voice and his little\r\nbeard; I do not say that he is a preacher, because every one has his\r\ntalent; but to give advice, he is the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! holy patience!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Agnes, with a mixture of gratitude and\r\nvexation one feels at an offer containing more good-will than\r\nsuitableness; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to me what another man is, when he who is gone\r\nknew our affairs, and had every thing prepared to help us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that. Excuse the trouble I have given you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is of no consequence, my good woman; I pity you; if you decide\r\nupon asking advice of one of the fathers, you will find the convent\r\nstill in its place. But let me see you soon, when I collect the oil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod preserve you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes; and she proceeded homeward, confused\r\nand disconcerted as a blind man who had lost his staff.\r\n\r\nHaving more information than Friar Galdino, we are enabled to relate the\r\ntruth of this affair. Attilio, immediately on his arrival at Milan,\r\nperformed his promise to Don Roderick, and visited his uncle of the\r\nsecret council; (this was a committee composed of thirteen members,\r\nwhose sanction was necessary to the proceedings of government; in case\r\nof the absence or death of the governor, the council assumed temporarily\r\nthe control.) The count, one of the oldest members of the council,\r\nenjoyed in it some authority, which he did not fail to make known on all\r\noccasions. His language was ambiguous; his silence significant; he had\r\nthe art of flattering, without absolutely promising; of menacing,\r\nwithout perhaps the power to perform; but these flatteries and menaces\r\nproduced in the minds of others an impression of his unlimited power,\r\nwhich was the end and purpose of all his actions. Towards this point he\r\nlately made a great stride on an extraordinary occasion. He had been\r\nsent on an embassy to Madrid! And to hear him describe his reception\r\nthere! Among other honours, the count-duke had treated him with\r\nparticular attention, had admitted him to his confidence, so far as to\r\nask him in the presence of the whole court, _if he were pleased with\r\nMadrid_? and to tell him on another occasion, at a window, that _the\r\ncathedral of Milan was the most magnificent church in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndominions_.\r\n\r\nAfter having paid his duty to the count, and presented the compliments\r\nof his cousin, Attilio, with a seriousness which he knew well how to\r\nassume, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it to be my duty to inform the signor, my\r\nuncle, of an affair in which Roderick is concerned, and which requires\r\nthe interference of your lordship to avert the serious consequences\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! one of his pranks, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, I must say that the injury has not been committed by\r\nRoderick, but he is exasperated, and none but my uncle can\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is in his neighbourhood a capuchin friar who sets himself in\r\narray against my cousin, who hates him, and the matter stands thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often have I told you both to let the friars manage their own\r\naffairs? It is enough for those to whom it belongs\xe2\x80\x94but you, you can\r\navoid having any thing to do with them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor uncle, it is my duty to inform you that Roderick would have\r\navoided it, if it had been possible. It is the friar who has quarrelled\r\nwith him, and he has used every means\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil can the friar have in common with my nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, he is known to be a quarrelsome fellow; he protects a\r\npeasant girl of the village, and regards her with a benevolence, to say\r\nthe least of it, very suspicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle; and a ray of malice passed over the\r\ndepth of dulness which nature had stamped on his countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor some time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Attilio, \xe2\x80\x9cthe friar has suspected Roderick of\r\ndesigns on this young girl\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ has suspected, indeed! I know the signor Roderick too well myself,\r\nnot to need to be told that he is incorrigible in such matters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Roderick, signor uncle, may have had some trifling conversation\r\nwith this girl, I can very well believe; he is young, and, moreover, not\r\na capuchin,\xe2\x80\x94but these are idle tales, not worth engaging your\r\nattention. The serious part of the affair is, that the friar speaks of\r\nRoderick as if he were a villain, and instigates all the country against\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other friars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not meddle with it, because they know him to be hot-headed,\r\nthough they have great respect for Roderick; but then, on the other\r\nhand, the friar passes for a saint with the villagers, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine he does not know Roderick is my nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he not know it? it is that, precisely, which animates him to this\r\ncourse of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe takes pleasure, and he tells it to every one, he takes the more\r\npleasure in vexing Roderick, because he has a protector as powerful as\r\nyour lordship; he laughs at the nobility, and at diplomatists, and\r\nexults at the thought, that the girdle of Saint Francis can tie up all\r\nthe swords, and that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the presumptuous man! what is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriar Christopher, of ***,\xe2\x80\x9d said Attilio. The count drew his portfolio\r\ntowards him, and inscribed the name.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Attilio proceeded: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has always had this character; his\r\nlife is well known; he was a plebeian, and having some wealth, wished to\r\nassociate with gentlemen, and not being able to succeed, killed one of\r\nthem for rage; and to escape the gallows he assumed the habit of a\r\nfriar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! well done! we will see, we will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count in a fume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Attilio, \xe2\x80\x9che is more enraged than ever, because he has\r\nfailed in a project he had much at heart. It is by this that your\r\nlordship can see what kind of a man he is. He wished to have this girl\r\nmarried, to remove her from the dangers of the world, you understand;\r\nand he had found his man, a fellow whose name you have doubtless heard,\r\nbecause I have understood that the secret council has been obliged to\r\ntake notice of the worthy youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA silk weaver, Lorenzo Tramaglino, he who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLorenzo Tramaglino!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, friar! Truly\xe2\x80\x94now I\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x94he had a letter for a\xe2\x80\x94it is a pity that\xe2\x80\x94but no matter. And\r\npray, why did Don Roderick say nothing of all this? why did he suffer\r\nthings to go so far, before he acquainted one who has the power and the\r\nwill to support him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you also the truth with respect to that: knowing the\r\nmultitude of cases which you have to perplex you, he has not been\r\nwilling to add to them; and, besides, since I must say it, he is beside\r\nhimself on account of the insults offered him by the friar, and would\r\nwish to wreak summary justice on him himself, rather than obtain it from\r\nprudence and the power of your lordship. I have tried to cool his\r\nardour, but finding it impossible, I thought it my duty to inform your\r\nlordship, who, after all, is the prop and chief column of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have spoken sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true. But I hoped the affair would finish of itself, or that\r\nthe friar would regain his reason, or that he would leave the convent,\r\nas often happens to these friars, who are sometimes here, sometimes\r\nthere; and then all would have been settled. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe arrangement of the business now rests with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I thought; I said to myself, the signor our uncle is the\r\nonly one who can save the honour of Don Roderick; he has a thousand\r\nmeans that I know not of: I know that the father provincial has a great\r\nrespect for him, and if our uncle should think that the best thing for\r\nthis friar would be a change of air, he can in a few words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your lordship leave the care of the business to him to whom it\r\nappertains?\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Attilio; \xe2\x80\x9cam I the man to give advice to your\r\nlordship? But the regard I have for the honour of the family made me\r\nspeak. And I am afraid I have committed another folly,\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\r\naffecting a pensive air: \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I have injured Don Roderick in\r\nyour opinion; I should have no rest if you doubted Roderick\xe2\x80\x99s confidence\r\nin you, and submission to your will. I hope the signor our uncle will\r\nbelieve, that in this case, it is truly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, you two will be always friends, until one of you become\r\nprudent. Ever in fault, and relying on me to repair it! You give me more\r\ntrouble than all the affairs of state!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, with an expression\r\nof grave importance.\r\n\r\nAttilio proffered a few more excuses, promises, and compliments, and\r\ntook his leave, with a parting injunction from his uncle _to be\r\nprudent_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe signor count formed the resolution to make use of the father\r\nprovincial to cut the knot of these perplexities; whether he would have\r\nthought of this, had it not been suggested by Attilio, it is impossible\r\nto determine, inasmuch as he would never have acknowledged this to be\r\nthe case. It was important that one of his family, his nephew, should\r\nnot be obliged to yield in an open controversy; it was a point essential\r\nto the reputation of his power, which he had so much at heart. The\r\nsatisfaction which his nephew might himself take of his adversary would\r\nbe a remedy worse than the disease. Should he order him to leave his\r\ncastle, when obedience would seem like flying from the field of battle?\r\nLegal force could have no power over the capuchin; the clergy were\r\nentirely exempt from secular jurisdiction. All that he could attempt\r\nagainst such an adversary was to endeavour to have him removed and the\r\npower to do this rested with the father provincial.\r\n\r\nNow the count and the father provincial were old acquaintances; they saw\r\neach other rarely, but always with great demonstrations of friendship,\r\nand reiterated offers of service.\r\n\r\nWhen all was matured in his mind, the count invited the father\r\nprovincial to a dinner, where he found a company of choice guests;\r\nnoblemen, who, by their deportment, their native boldness, and lordly\r\ndisdain, impressed those around them with the idea of their superiority\r\nand power. There were also present some clients, who, attached to the\r\nhouse by hereditary devotion, and the service of a life, sat at their\r\nlord\xe2\x80\x99s table, in a spirit of implicit submission, \xe2\x80\x9cdevouring his\r\ndiscourse\xe2\x80\x9d and his dinner with unqualified and equal approbation.\r\n\r\nAt table, the count led the conversation to Madrid; he spoke of the\r\ncourt, the count-duke, the ministers, the family of the governor; of the\r\nbull-fights, which he could well describe, having seen them from a\r\ndistinguished place; of the escurial, of which he could speak in its\r\nmost minute details, because a page of the count-duke had conducted him\r\ninto every nook of it. For some time all the company were attentive to\r\nhim alone; then they divided into separate parties. He continued for a\r\nwhile to relate a number of anecdotes, as in confidence, to the father\r\nprovincial, who was seated near him. But suddenly he gave a turn to the\r\nconversation, and spoke of Cardinal Barberini, who was a capuchin, and\r\nbrother to the reigning pope, Urban VIII. As they left the table, the\r\ncount invited the father provincial to go with him into another\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord gave a seat to the reverend father, and taking one\r\nhimself, said, \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering the friendship that exists between us, I\r\nthought I was authorised to speak to your reverence of an affair equally\r\ninteresting to us both, and which had best be concluded between us\r\nwithout going farther, which might\xe2\x80\x94and I will tell you frankly what it\r\nis, as I am certain we shall have the same opinion on the subject. Tell\r\nme, in your convent of Pescarenico, is there not a Father Christopher of\r\n***?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father provincial bowed assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray your reverence to tell me, frankly, as a friend,\xe2\x80\x94this man\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94I have no personal acquaintance with him, \xe2\x80\x99tis true; I know many\r\nfervent, prudent, humble capuchins, who are worth their weight in gold;\r\nI have been the friend of the order from infancy; but in a numerous\r\nfamily there is always some individual\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94And I have reason to think\r\nthat Friar Christopher is a man\xe2\x80\x94a little fond of quarrelling\xe2\x80\x94who has\r\nnot all the prudence he might have: I imagine he has caused your\r\nreverence much anxiety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive there is some intrigue,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the father provincial; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis my fault; I knew that this holy man should have been sent from pulpit\r\nto pulpit, and not have been suffered to remain six months in a convent\r\nin the country.\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI am truly sorry that your\r\nexcellency has conceived such an opinion of Father Christopher; for I\r\nknow that his conduct in the convent is exemplary, and that he is\r\nesteemed by every body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand very well; your reverence ought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94However, I would as a\r\nfriend inform you of a matter which it is necessary you should know.\r\nThis Father Christopher has taken under his protection a young man of\r\nthat country, one of whom your reverence must have heard; him who\r\nrecently escaped from the hands of justice, on the terrible day of San\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x94Lorenzo Tramaglino!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not heard of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father provincial; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your\r\nexcellency knows that it is the duty of our order to seek those who have\r\ngone astray, for the purpose of leading them back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true; but I thought it best to give you this information,\r\nbecause, if ever his holiness\xe2\x80\x94the intelligence of it may have been sent\r\nto Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to your excellency for the information. However, I am\r\ncertain, that if the affair is enquired into, it will be found that\r\nFather Christopher has had no connection with this man but for the\r\npurpose of doing him good. I know the father well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour reverence knows, then, better than I, what he was in the world,\r\nand the pranks of his youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the glory of our habit, signor count, that whatever a man may\r\nhave been in the world, once clothed with that, he is quite another\r\nperson; and since the Father Christopher has belonged to our order\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it from the bottom of my heart, I believe it; but\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94as the proverb says\xe2\x80\x94The habit does not make the monk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proverb was not much to the purpose, but the count had cited it, in\r\nplace of another which occurred to him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe wolf may change his skin,\r\nbut he does not become a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have certain information,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your excellency knows positively that the father has committed a\r\nfault (we are all liable to err), I wish you would inform me of it. I am\r\nhis superior\xe2\x80\x94unworthily, \xe2\x80\x99tis true; but it is my duty to watch over,\r\nand, if necessary, correct\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides the circumstance of his granting protection to the man I have\r\nmentioned, this same Father Christopher has undertaken to contend\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwe can settle it together with my nephew, Don Roderick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sorry for that, I am sorry for that, truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nephew is young, rash, and not accustomed to provocation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt becomes my duty to obtain the best information on the subject. Your\r\nexcellency, with your experience of the world, knows better than I, that\r\nwe are all frail, liable to error\xe2\x80\x94some one way, some another; and if\r\nour Father Christopher has failed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut these are things which had better be settled between ourselves; to\r\nspread them abroad would only increase the evil. These trifles are often\r\nthe cause of numerous embarrassments and difficulties, which might have\r\nbeen prevented by some decisive act in the commencement. That is now our\r\nbusiness; my nephew is young; the monk, from what I hear, has still the\r\nspirit, the inclinations of a young man; but we, who are advanced in\r\nyears, (too true, is it not, reverend father?) must have prudence to act\r\nfor the young, and apply a remedy to their follies. Happily there is yet\r\ntime; we must remove the fire from the straw. An individual who does not\r\ndo well in one place may in another; your reverence might see to his\r\nbeing removed, might find a suitable station for the friar at a\r\nsufficient distance\xe2\x80\x94all may be easily arranged\xe2\x80\x94or rather, there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nharm done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father provincial had expected this conclusion from the commencement\r\nof the conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere you would lead me;\r\nwhen a poor friar gives one of you the least umbrage, the superior must\r\nmake him march, right or wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the count had finished, the provincial said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand\r\nwhat the signor count would say; but before taking a step\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a step, and it is not a step, very reverend father: it is only a\r\nnatural event, such as might happen in the ordinary course of affairs;\r\nand if we do not do it quickly, I foresee a deluge of disorders, a\r\nmountain of grievances. If we do not put a stop to the affair between\r\nourselves, it is not possible it should remain a secret. And then it is\r\nnot only my nephew\xe2\x80\x94you raise a wasp\xe2\x80\x99s nest, very reverend father. We\r\nare a powerful house\xe2\x80\x94we have adherents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father bowed in assent. The count proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand me;\r\nthey are all people who have blood in their veins, and who in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94count as something. They are proud of their honour; the affair\r\nwill become theirs, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Even those who are the friends of\r\npeace\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 It would be a grief of heart to me to be obliged\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I, who\r\nhave always had such a friendship for the capuchins! The fathers, for\r\ntheir ministry to be efficient, should be in harmony with all men\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nmisunderstandings: besides, they have relations abroad\xe2\x80\x94and these\r\naffairs of punctilio extend, ramify\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I, too, have a certain dignity\r\nto maintain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 His excellency\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94my noble colleagues\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 It becomes a\r\nparty matter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the provincial, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Father Christopher is a\r\npreacher; I had already the intention\xe2\x80\x94I have even been solicited to do\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94but under these circumstances, and just at this time, it might be\r\nconsidered as a punishment; and to punish without being well\r\nacquainted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not a punishment; it is a prudent precaution, an honest means\r\nof preventing evils that might\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I have explained myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signor count and myself understand each other very well; but the\r\nfacts being those which your excellency has adduced, it is impossible\r\nbut that they should in part be known through the country: there are\r\nevery where firebrands, or idle spirits, who find pleasure in the\r\ncontests of the monks and the nobility, and love to make malignant\r\nobservations. Each one has his own dignity to preserve; and I, in the\r\ncharacter of a superior, have an express duty\xe2\x80\x94the honour of the\r\nhabit\xe2\x80\x94it is not my own affair\xe2\x80\x94it is a deposit which\xe2\x80\x94and since the\r\nsignor your nephew is so irritated, as your excellency has said, he\r\nmight take it as a satisfaction offered to him, and\xe2\x80\x94I do not say boast\r\nof it, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jest, reverend father, surely; my nephew is a cavalier of\r\nconsideration in the world, as he should be; but in his relations with\r\nme, he is but a child, and will do neither more nor less than I\r\nprescribe to him. And, moreover, he shall never know it. The thing is\r\ndone between ourselves; there is no necessity for rendering an account\r\nto him. Let not that give you any uneasiness; I am accustomed to keep\r\nsilence on important subjects. As to the idle talk of others, what can\r\nbe said? It is a very common thing to see a friar leave one place to go\r\nand preach at another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, in order to prevent malicious observations, it would be\r\nnecessary, on this occasion, that the nephew of your excellency should\r\ngive some demonstration of friendship, of deference,\xe2\x80\x94not for us, but\r\nfor the order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly, that is but right; it is not necessary, however;\r\nI know that the capuchins are highly esteemed by my nephew, as well as\r\nby our whole family. But, in this case, something more signal is very\r\nproper. Leave it to me, very reverend father: I will give such orders to\r\nmy nephew\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, it shall be prudently suggested to him, that\r\nhe may not suspect what has passed between us, because we need not apply\r\na plaster where there is no wound. As to that which we have agreed on,\r\nthe sooner it is done the better; and if you had a place at some\r\ndistance\xe2\x80\x94to remove every occasion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want a preacher at Rimini; and perhaps without this motive I\r\nshould have thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very opportune, very opportune. And when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the thing is to be done, it shall be quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly; better to-day than to-morrow. And,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\nrising, \xe2\x80\x9cif I or my adherents can render any service to the good father\r\ncapuchins\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have often experienced the kindness of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father\r\nprovincial, also rising, and following his vanquisher to the door of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have extinguished a spark,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca spark, very reverend\r\nfather, which might have excited a great conflagration. Between good\r\nfriends, things are easily arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey then entered the next apartment, and mixed with the rest of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe count obtained his end: Friar Christopher was made to travel on foot\r\nfrom Pescarenico to Rimini, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nOne evening a capuchin from Milan arrived at Pescarenico, with a packet\r\nfor the superior: it was an order for Father Christopher to repair to\r\nRimini for the purpose of preaching the Lent sermons. The letter\r\ncontained instructions to the superior, to insinuate to the friar, that\r\nhe should give up every attention to any business he might have on hand\r\nin the country he must leave, and that he should not maintain any\r\ncorrespondence there. The friar, who was the bearer of the order, was to\r\nbe the companion of his journey. The superior said nothing that night,\r\nbut in the morning he sent for Father Christopher, showed him the order,\r\nand told him to take his basket, staff, and girdle, and with the friar,\r\nwhom he presented to him, commence his journey.\r\n\r\nImagine what a blow this was for our good father. Renzo, Lucy, Agnes,\r\npassed rapidly over his mind, and he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God! what will\r\nthese unfortunate people do, when I am no longer here?\xe2\x80\x9d but raising his\r\neyes to heaven, he placed his hope and confidence there. He crossed his\r\nhands on his breast, and bowed his head in token of obedience; he then\r\nwent to his cell, took his basket, his staff, and his breviary, and\r\nafter having bid farewell to his brethren, and obtained the benediction\r\nof his superior, took, with his companion, the route prescribed.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Don Roderick, more than ever determined on the\r\naccomplishment of his infamous enterprise, had resolved to seek the\r\nassistance of a powerful man. We cannot give his name, nor even hazard a\r\nconjecture with regard to it; this is the more astonishing, inasmuch as\r\nwe find notices of this personage in several histories of the time. The\r\nidentity of the facts does not leave a doubt of the identity of the man;\r\nbut there is evidently an extreme care to avoid the mention of his name.\r\nFrancesco Rivola, in his life of the Cardinal Federigo Borromeo,\r\nspeaking of him, says, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a lord as powerful from his wealth as\r\nillustrious from his birth,\xe2\x80\x9d and nothing further. Giuseppe Ripamonti\r\nmakes farther mention of him, as a _man_, this _man_, a _person_, this\r\n_person_. \xe2\x80\x9cI will relate,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe case of a man, who, belonging\r\nto the most powerful family in the city, chose the country for his\r\nresidence; and there, assuring himself of impunity by the force of\r\ncrime, he set at nought the law and the magistrates, the king and the\r\nnobles. Placed on the extreme confines of the state, he led an\r\nindependent life; he offered an asylum to the outlaw; he was outlawed\r\nhimself, and then absolved from the sentence which had led\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d We will\r\nhereafter quote from this author other passages, which will confirm the\r\nhistory we are about to relate.\r\n\r\nTo do that which was forbidden by the laws; to be the arbiter, the\r\nsupreme judge in the affairs of others, without other interest than a\r\nthirst for power; to be feared by all, even by those who were the\r\nobjects of fear to all men; these had ever been the controlling\r\nprinciples which actuated the conduct of this man. From his youth he had\r\nbeen filled with impatient envy at the power and authority of others;\r\nsuperior to the greater number in riches and retinue, and to all perhaps\r\nin birth and audacity, he constrained them to renounce all competition\r\nwith him; he took some into his friendship, but was far from admitting\r\nany equality between himself and them; his proud and disdainful spirit\r\ncould only be content with those who were willing to acknowledge their\r\ninferiority, and to yield to him on all occasions. When, however, they\r\nfound themselves in any difficulty, they did not fail to solicit the aid\r\nof so powerful an auxiliary; and a refusal from him would have been the\r\ndestruction of his reputation, and of the high station which he had\r\nassumed. So that, for himself and others, he had performed such deeds\r\nthat not all his own power and that of his family could prevent his\r\nbanishment and outlawry; and he was obliged to leave the state. I\r\nbelieve that it is to this circumstance Ripamonti alludes:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was obliged to leave the country: but his audacity was unsubdued; he\r\nwent through the city on horseback, followed by a pack of hounds, and\r\nwith the sound of the trumpet; passing by the court of the palace, he\r\nsent an abusive message to the governor by one of the guards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his absence he did not desist from his evil practices; he maintained\r\na correspondence with his friends, \xe2\x80\x9cwho were united to him,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nRipamonti, \xe2\x80\x9cin a secret league of atrocious deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appears that he even contracted new habits, of which the same\r\nhistorian speaks with mysterious brevity. \xe2\x80\x9cForeign princes had recourse\r\nto him for important murders, and they even sent him reinforcements of\r\nsoldiers to act under his orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last, whether the proclamation of his outlawry was withdrawn from\r\nsome powerful intercession, or that the audacity of the man outweighed\r\nall authority, he resolved to return home; not exactly to Milan, but to\r\na castle on the frontier of the Bergamascan territory, which then\r\nbelonged to the Venetian state. \xe2\x80\x9cThis house,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ripamonti, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a\r\nfocus of sanguinary mandates. The household was composed of such as had\r\nbeen guilty of great crimes; the cooks, and the scullions even, were not\r\nfree from the stain of murder.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides this notable household, he had\r\nmen resembling them, stationed in different places of the two states, on\r\nthe confines of which he lived.\r\n\r\nAll, however tyrannical themselves, had been obliged to choose between\r\nthe friendship or enmity of this tyrannical man, and it fared ill with\r\nthose who dared resist him. It was in vain to hope to preserve\r\nneutrality or independence; his orders to do such or such a thing, or to\r\nrefrain, were arbitrary, and resistance was useless. Recourse was had to\r\nhim on all occasions, and by all sorts of people, good as well as bad,\r\nfor the arrangements of their difficulties; so that he occasionally\r\nbecame the protector of the oppressed, who could not have obtained\r\nredress in any other way, public or private. He was almost always the\r\nminister of wickedness, revenge, and caprice; but the various ways in\r\nwhich he had employed his power impressed upon all minds a great idea of\r\nhis capability to devise and perform his acts in defiance of every\r\nobstruction, whether lawful or unlawful. The fame of ordinary tyrants\r\nwas confined to their own districts, and every district had its tyrant;\r\nbut the fame of this extraordinary man was spread throughout the\r\nMilanese; his life was the subject of popular tales, and his name\r\ncarried with it something powerful and mysterious. Every tyrant was\r\nsuspected of alliance with him, every assassin of acting under his\r\norders; at every extraordinary crime, of the author of which they were\r\nignorant, the name of this man was uttered, whom, thanks to the\r\ncircumspection of our historians, we are obliged to call the Unknown.\r\n\r\nThe distance between his castle and that of Don Roderick was not more\r\nthan six miles. The latter had long felt the necessity of keeping on\r\ngood terms with such a neighbour, and had proffered his services, and\r\nentitled himself to the same sort of friendship, as the rest; he was\r\nhowever, careful to conceal the nature and strictness of the union\r\nbetween them. Don Roderick liked to play the tyrant, but not openly;\r\ntyranny was with him a means, not an end; he wished to live at ease in\r\nthe city, and enjoy the advantages, pleasures, and honours of civilised\r\nlife. To insure this, he was obliged to exhibit management, to testify a\r\ngreat esteem for his relations, to cultivate the friendship of persons\r\nin place, in order to sway the balance of justice for his own peculiar\r\npurposes. Now, an intimacy with such a man would not have advanced his\r\ninterests in such points, and especially with his uncle; but a slight\r\nacquaintance with him might be considered unavoidable under the\r\ncircumstances, and therefore in some degree excusable. One morning Don\r\nRoderick, equipped for the chase, with an escort of retainers, among\r\nwhom was Griso, took the road to the castle of the Unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castle of the Unknown was situated above a narrow and shady valley,\r\non the summit of a cliff, which, belonging to a rugged chain of\r\nmountains, was nevertheless separated from them by banks, caverns, and\r\nprecipices. It was only accessible on the side which overlooked the\r\nvalley. This was a declivity rather steep, but equal, and continued\r\ntowards the summit: it was occupied as pasture ground, and its lower\r\nborders were cultivated, having habitations scattered here and there.\r\nThe bottom was a bed of stones, through which flowed, according to the\r\nseason, a small brook, or a large torrent, which served for a boundary\r\nbetween the two territories. The opposite chain of mountains, which\r\nformed, as it were, the other wall of the valley, was slightly\r\ncultivated towards its base; the rest was composed of precipitous rocks\r\nwithout verdure, and thrown together irregularly and wildly. The scene\r\naltogether was one of savage grandeur.\r\n\r\nFrom this castle, as the eagle from his eyrie, its lawless owner\r\noverlooked his domain, and heard no human sound above him. He could\r\nembrace at a view all the environs, the declivities, the abyss, the\r\npracticable approaches. To the eyes of one viewing it from above, the\r\nwinding path which ascended towards the terrible habitation could be\r\nperceived throughout its whole course, and from the windows and\r\nloopholes, the signor could leisurely count the steps of the person\r\nascending, and examine him with the closest scrutiny. With the garrison\r\nof bravoes which he kept at the castle he could defy an army, which he\r\nwould have crushed in the valley beneath, before an individual could\r\nreach the summit. But none, except such as were friends with the master\r\nof the castle, dared set foot even in the valley. Tragical stories were\r\nrelated of some who had attempted the dangerous enterprise, but these\r\nstories were already of times long past, and none of the young vassals\r\ncould remember to have encountered a human being in this place, except\r\nunder his lord\xe2\x80\x99s authority.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick arrived in the middle of the valley, at the foot of the\r\ncliff, at the commencement of the rugged and winding path; at this point\r\nwas a tavern, which might have been called a guard-house; an old sign,\r\nwith a rising sun painted on both sides, was suspended before the door;\r\nbut the people gave the place the more appropriate name of _Malanotte_.\r\n\r\nAt the noise of the approaching cavalcade a young boy, well furnished\r\nwith swords and pistols, appeared on the threshold of the door; and\r\ncasting a rapid glance at the party, informed three ruffians, who were\r\nplaying at cards within the house, of its approach. He who appeared to\r\nbe the chief among them arose, and recognising a friend of his master,\r\nsaluted him respectfully; Don Roderick returned the salutation with much\r\npoliteness, and asked if the signor was at the castle. The man replied\r\nin the affirmative; and he, dismounting, threw his horse\xe2\x80\x99s bridle to\r\nAimwell, one of his retinue. Then, taking his musket from his shoulder,\r\nhe gave it to _Montanarolo_, as if to relieve himself from an useless\r\nencumbrance, but in reality because he knew that on this cliff none were\r\npermitted to bear arms. Drawing from his pocket some _berlinghe_, he\r\ngave them to _Tanabuso_, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWait here till my return; and in the\r\nmean time amuse yourselves with these honest people.\xe2\x80\x9d Then presenting to\r\nthe chief of the band some crowns of gold for himself and his\r\ncompanions, he ascended the path with Griso.\r\n\r\nAnother bravo belonging to the Unknown, who was on his way to the\r\ncastle, bore him company; thus sparing him the trouble of declaring his\r\nname to whomsoever he should meet. When he arrived at the castle (Griso\r\nwas left at the gate) he was conducted through a long succession of dark\r\ngalleries, and various halls hung with muskets, sabres, and other\r\nweapons of warfare; each of these halls was guarded by a bravo. After\r\nhaving waited some time, he was admitted to the presence of the Unknown,\r\nwho advanced to meet him, replying to his salutation, and at the same\r\ntime, as was his custom, even with his oldest friends, eying him from\r\nhead to foot. He was tall in stature; and from the baldness of his head,\r\nand the deep furrows of his countenance, appeared to be much older than\r\nsixty, which was his real age; his countenance and movements, the\r\nfirmness of his features, and the fire which sparkled from his eyes,\r\nindicated a vigour of body as well as of mind which would have been\r\nremarkable even in a young man.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick told him he had come for advice and assistance; that,\r\nhaving embarked in a difficult enterprise, from which his honour did not\r\nsuffer him to withdraw, he had remembered the promises of one who never\r\npromised in vain; and he then related his abominable intrigue. The\r\nUnknown, who had already heard something of it, listened with much\r\nattention to the recital, both because he naturally loved such\r\nrelations, and because Friar Christopher, that avowed enemy of tyrants,\r\nwas concerned in it. Don Roderick spoke of the difficulty of the\r\nundertaking, the distance of the place, a monastery, the _signora_,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe Unknown, as if prompted by the demon in his heart, interrupted him,\r\nsaying, that he took the charge of the affair on himself. He wrote down\r\nthe name of the poor Lucy, and dismissed Don Roderick, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a\r\nlittle while you will receive news from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember the villain Egidio, who lived near the walls of\r\nthe monastery into which Lucy had been received; now, he was one of the\r\nmost intimate colleagues in crime of the Unknown; and this accounts for\r\nthe promptness with which this lord assumed the charge of the\r\nundertaking. However, no sooner was he left alone than he repented of\r\nhis precipitation. He had for some time experienced, not remorse, but a\r\nvague uneasiness on account of his crimes; at every new addition to\r\nthem, the remembrance of those he had previously committed pressed upon\r\nhis memory, if not upon his conscience, and loaded it with an\r\nintolerable weight. An undefinable repugnance to the commission of\r\ncrime, such as he had experienced and subdued at the outset of his\r\ncareer, returned with all its force to overwhelm his spirit. The\r\nthoughts of the future contributed to render the past more painful. \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\ngrow old! to die! and then?\xe2\x80\x9d And the image of death, which he had so\r\noften met undaunted, in face of an enemy, and which seemed to inflame\r\nhis courage and double his energy\xe2\x80\x94this same image now, in the midnight\r\nsilence of his castle, quelled his spirit, and impressed him with an awe\r\nwhich he in vain endeavoured to resist. Formerly, the frequent spectacle\r\nof violence and murder, inspiring him with a ferocious emulation, had\r\nserved as a kind of authority against his conscience; now the confused\r\nbut terrible idea arose in his mind of individual responsibility at the\r\nbar of God. The idea of having risen above the crowd of vulgar\r\ncriminals, and of having left them far behind, an idea which once\r\nflattered his pride, now impressed him with a sentiment of fearful\r\nsolitude; and experiencing at certain moments of despondence the power\r\nand presence of that God whose existence he had hitherto neither\r\nadmitted nor denied, having been wholly immersed in himself, his\r\naccumulated crimes rose up, to justify the sentence which was about to\r\ncondemn him to eternal banishment from the divine presence. But this\r\nuneasiness was not suffered to appear, either in his words or his\r\nactions; he carefully concealed it under the appearance of more profound\r\nand intense ferocity. Regretting the time when he was accustomed to\r\ncommit iniquity without remorse, without any other solicitude than for\r\nits success, he made every effort to recall these habits and feelings;\r\nto take pleasure in wickedness; and glory in his shame, in order to\r\nconvince himself that he was still the same man.\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the promptitude of his promise to Don Roderick: he\r\nwished to deprive himself of the chance of hesitation; but, scarcely\r\nalone, he felt his resolution fail, and thoughts arose in his mind which\r\nalmost tempted him to break his word, and expose his weakness to an\r\ninferior accomplice. But with a violent effort he put an end to the\r\npainful conflict. He sent for Nibbio[30], one of the most skilful and\r\nresolute ministers of his atrocities, and of whom he had made use in his\r\ncorrespondence with Egidio, and ordered him to mount his horse, to go to\r\nMonza, to inform Egidio of the affair he had undertaken, and to require\r\nhis assistance for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\n      [30] Kite.\r\n\r\nThe messenger returned sooner than his master expected him with the\r\nreply of Egidio; the enterprise was easy and safe; the Unknown had only\r\nto send a carriage with two or three bravoes, well disguised; Egidio\r\ntook charge of the rest. The Unknown, whatever passed in his mind, gave\r\norders to Nibbio to arrange every thing, and to set out immediately on\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nIf, to perform the horrible service which had been required of him,\r\nEgidio had depended only on his ordinary means, he would not certainly\r\nhave sent back so explicit an answer. But in the asylum of the convent,\r\nwhere every thing appeared as an obstacle, the villain had a means known\r\nto himself alone; and that which would have been an insurmountable\r\ndifficulty to others was to him an instrument of success. We have\r\nrelated how the unhappy signora once lent an ear to his discourse, and\r\nthe reader may have surmised that this was not the last time; it was\r\nonly the first step in the path of abomination and blood. The same voice\r\nwhich then addressed her, become imperious through crime, now imposed on\r\nher the sacrifice of the innocent girl who had been intrusted to her\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe proposition appeared frightful to Gertrude; to lose Lucy in any\r\nmanner would have seemed to her a misfortune, a punishment; and to\r\ndeprive herself of her with criminal perfidy, to add to her crimes by\r\ndealing treacherously with the confiding girl, was to take away the only\r\ngleam of virtuous enjoyment which had shone upon her mysterious and\r\nwicked career. She tried every method to avoid obedience; every method,\r\nexcept the only infallible one, that was in her power. Crime is a severe\r\nand inflexible master, against whom we are strong only when we entirely\r\nrebel. Gertrude could not resolve on that, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe day agreed on came; the hour approached; Gertrude, alone with Lucy,\r\nbestowed on her more caresses than ordinary, which the poor girl\r\nreturned with increasing tenderness, as the lamb licks the hand of the\r\nshepherd who entices it without the fold into the murderous power of the\r\nbutcher who there awaits it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to do me a great favour; many are ready to obey me, but\r\nthere is none but yourself whom I can trust. I must speak immediately on\r\nan affair of great importance, which I will relate to you some other\r\ntime, to the superior of the capuchins, who brought you hither, my dear\r\nLucy; but no one must know that I have sent for him. I rely on you to\r\ncarry a secret message\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy was astonished at such a request, and alleged her reasons for\r\ndeclining to perform it; without her mother! without a companion! in a\r\nsolitary road! in a strange country! But Gertrude, instructed in an\r\ninfernal school, showed great astonishment and displeasure at her\r\nrefusal, after having been loaded with so many benefits; she affected to\r\ntreat her excuses as frivolous. \xe2\x80\x9cIn open day! a short distance! a road\r\nthat Lucy had travelled a few days before!\xe2\x80\x9d She said so much, that the\r\npoor girl, touched with gratitude and shame, enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was to be\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the convent of the capuchins; ask for the superior, tell him to\r\ncome here immediately, but to let no one suspect that he comes at my\r\nrequest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what shall I say to the portress, who has never seen me go out, and\r\nwill ask me where I am going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEndeavour to pass without being seen; and if you cannot, say you are\r\ngoing to some church to perform your orisons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new difficulty for Lucy! to tell a falsehood! but the signora was so\r\noffended at her refusal, and so ridiculed her for preferring a vain\r\nscruple to her gratitude, that the unhappy girl, alarmed rather than\r\nconvinced, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will go; may God be my guide and\r\nprotector.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude, from her grated window, followed her with anxious looks, and\r\nwhen she saw her about to cross the threshold, overcome by irresistible\r\nemotion, she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cStop, Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy returned to the window; but another idea, the one accustomed to\r\npredominate, had resumed its sway over the mind of the unhappy Gertrude.\r\nShe affected dissatisfaction at the directions she had given; described\r\nthe road again to Lucy, and dismissed her: \xe2\x80\x9cDo exactly as I have told\r\nyou, and return quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy passed the door of the cloister unobserved, and proceeding on her\r\nway with downcast eyes, found, with the aid of the directions given, and\r\nher own recollections, the gate of the suburb; timid and trembling, she\r\ncontinued on the high road, until she arrived at that which led to the\r\nconvent. This road was buried, like the bed of a river, between two high\r\nbanks, bordered with trees, whose branches united to form an arch above\r\nit. On finding it entirely deserted, she felt her fears revive; she\r\nhurried on, but gained courage from the sight of a travelling carriage\r\nwhich had stopped a short distance before her; before the door of it,\r\nwhich was open, there stood two travellers looking about, as if\r\nuncertain of their way. As she approached, she heard one of them say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a good girl, who will tell us the way.\xe2\x80\x9d As she came on a line\r\nwith the carriage, this same man addressed her: \xe2\x80\x9cMy good girl, can you\r\ntell us the way to Monza?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going in the wrong direction,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the poor girl; \xe2\x80\x9cMonza\r\nlies there.\xe2\x80\x9d As she turned to point it out, his companion (it was\r\nNibbio) seized her by the waist, and lifted her from the ground. Lucy\r\nscreamed from surprise and terror; the ruffian threw her into the\r\ncarriage; a third, who was seated in the bottom of it, seized her, and\r\ncompelled her to sit down before him; another put a handkerchief over\r\nher mouth, and stifled her cries. Nibbio then entered the carriage, the\r\ndoor was closed, and the horses set off on a gallop. He who had asked\r\nher the perfidious question remained behind; he was an emissary of\r\nEgidio, who had watched Lucy when she quitted the convent, and had\r\nhastened by a shorter road to inform his colleagues, and wait for her at\r\nthe place agreed on.\r\n\r\nBut who can describe the terror and anguish of the unfortunate girl? Who\r\ncan tell what passed in her heart? Cruelly anxious to ascertain her\r\nhorrible situation, she wildly opened her eyes, but closed them again at\r\nthe sight of those frightful faces. She struggled in vain. The men held\r\nher down in the bottom of the carriage: if she attempted to cry, they\r\ndrew the handkerchief tightly over her mouth. In the mean while, three\r\ngruff voices, endeavouring to assume a tone of humanity, said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, be quiet: do not be afraid; we do not wish to harm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter a while her struggles ceased, she languidly opened her eyes, and\r\nthe horrible faces before her appeared to blend themselves into one\r\nmonstrous image; her colour fled, and she fell lifeless into their arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, courage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibbio; but Lucy was now beyond the reach of\r\nhis horrible voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! she appears to be dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she should\r\nreally be dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthese fainting fits are common to women; they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t die in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibbio, \xe2\x80\x9cbe attentive to your duty, and do not meddle with\r\nother affairs. Keep your muskets ready, because this wood we are\r\nentering is a nest for robbers. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep them in your hands\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndevil! put them behind you. Do you not see that this girl is a tender\r\nchicken, who faints at nothing? If she sees that you have arms, she may\r\ndie in reality. When she comes to her senses, be careful not to frighten\r\nher. Touch her not, unless I tell you to do so. I can hold her. Keep\r\nquiet, and let me talk to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the carriage entered the wood. Poor Lucy awoke as from a\r\nprofound and painful slumber. She opened her eyes, and her horrible\r\nsituation rushed with full force upon her mind. She struggled again in\r\nvain, she attempted to scream, but Nibbio said to her, holding up the\r\nhandkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cBe tranquil; it is the best thing you can do. We do not\r\nwish to harm you; but if you do not keep silence, we must make you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go. Who are you? Where are you taking me? Why am I here? Let me\r\ngo, let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened. You are not a child, and you ought to\r\nknow that we will not harm you. We might have murdered you before this,\r\nif such had been our intention. Be quiet, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, let me go; I know you not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know you well enough, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, holy Virgin! Let me go, for charity\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Who are you? Why have\r\nyou brought me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we have been ordered to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? who? who ordered you to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nibbio, in a severe tone. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch questions must not be\r\nanswered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy attempted to throw herself from the door of the carriage, but\r\nfinding the effort vain, she had recourse again to entreaties, and with\r\nher cheeks bathed in tears, and her voice broken by sobs, she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the love of heaven, and the holy Virgin, let me go! What harm\r\nhave I done you? I am a poor creature, who have never injured you; I\r\nforgive you all that you have done, and will pray to God for you. If you\r\nhave a daughter, a wife, or a mother, think what they would suffer in my\r\nsituation. Remember that we must all die, and that one day you will\r\nhope that God will show mercy to you. Let me go, let me go; the Lord\r\nwill guide me on my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot? Great God! why can you not? Where are you taking me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot; your supplications are useless. Do not be frightened; we\r\nwill not harm you. Be quiet; no one shall harm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore than ever alarmed to perceive that her words produced no effect,\r\nLucy turned to Him who holds in his powerful hand the hearts of men, and\r\ncan, if he sees fit, soften the most ferocious. She crossed her arms on\r\nher breast, and prayed from the depth of her heart, fervently; then\r\nagain vainly implored to be set free: but we have not the heart to\r\nrelate more at length this painful journey, which lasted four hours, and\r\nwhich was to be succeeded by many hours of still deeper anguish.\r\n\r\nAt the castle, the Unknown was waiting her arrival with extraordinary\r\nsolicitude and agitation of mind. Strange, that he who had coldly and\r\ncalmly disposed of so many lives, and had regarded as nothing the\r\ntorments he inflicted, should now feel an impression of remorse, almost\r\nof terror, at the tyranny he exercised over an unknown girl, an humble\r\npeasant! From a high window of his castle, he had for some time looked\r\ndown upon the valley beneath; at last he saw the carriage approaching\r\nslowly at a distance, as if the horses were wearied with their rapid\r\njourney. He perceived it, and felt his heart beat violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she there?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat trouble this girl gives me! I must\r\nfree myself from it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he prepared himself to send one of his\r\nruffians to meet the carriage, and tell Nibbio to conduct the girl\r\nimmediately to the castle of Don Roderick; but an imperious _No_, which\r\nmade itself heard by his conscience, caused him to relinquish his\r\ndesign. Tormented, however, by the necessity of ordering something to be\r\ndone, and insupportably weary of waiting the slow approach of the\r\ncarriage, he sent for an old woman who was attached to his service.\r\n\r\nThis woman had been born in the castle, and had passed her life in it.\r\nShe had been impressed from infancy with an opinion of the unlimited\r\npower of its masters; and her principal maxim was implicit obedience\r\ntowards them. To the ideas of duty were united sentiments of respect,\r\nfear, and servile devotion. When the Unknown became lord of the castle,\r\nand began to make such horrible use of his power, she experienced a\r\ndegree of pain, and at the same time a more profound sentiment of\r\nsubjection. In time she became habituated to what was daily acting\r\nbefore her: the powerful and unbridled will of such a lord she viewed as\r\nan exercise of fated justice. When somewhat advanced in years, she had\r\nespoused a servant of the house, who being sent on a hazardous\r\nexpedition, left his body on the high road, and his wife a widow in the\r\ncastle. The revenge that her lord took for his death imparted to her a\r\nsavage consolation, and increased her pride at being under his\r\nprotection. From that day she rarely set foot beyond the castle walls,\r\nand by degrees there remained to her no other idea of human beings, than\r\nthat of those by whom she was daily surrounded. She was not employed in\r\nany particular service, but each one gave her something to do as it\r\npleased him. She had sometimes clothes to mend, food to prepare, and\r\nwounds to dress. Commands, reproaches, and thanks were equally mingled\r\nwith abusive raillery: she went by the appellation of the _old woman_,\r\nand the tone with which the name was uttered varied according to the\r\ncircumstances and humour of the speaker. Disturbed in her idleness and\r\nirritated in her self-love, which were her two ruling passions, she\r\nreturned these compliments with language in which Satan might have\r\nrecognised more of his own genius than in that of her persecutors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that carriage below there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a litter prepared immediately, and let it carry you to\r\n_Malanotte_. Quick, quick; you must arrive before the carriage; it\r\napproaches with the slow step of death. In this carriage there is\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nought to be\xe2\x80\x94a young girl. If she is there, tell Nibbio from me, that he\r\nmust place her in the litter, and that he must come at once to me. You\r\nwill get into the litter with her; and when you arrive here, you must\r\ntake her to your room. If she asks you where you are leading her, whose\r\nis this castle, be careful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not doubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Unknown, \xe2\x80\x9ccomfort her, encourage her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you say to her? Comfort her, I tell you. Have you arrived at\r\nthis age, and know not how to administer consolation to the afflicted?\r\nHave you never had any sorrow? Have you never been visited by fear? Do\r\nyou not know the language that consoles in such moments? Speak this\r\nlanguage to _her_ then; find it in the remembrance of your own\r\nmisfortunes. Go directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, he remained some time at the window, gazing at the\r\napproaching carriage; he then looked at the setting sun, and the\r\nglorious display of clouds about the horizon. He soon withdrew, closed\r\nthe window, and kept pacing the apartment in a state of uneasy\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old woman hastened to obey, and gave orders, under authority of that\r\nname which, by whomsoever pronounced, set the whole castle in motion, as\r\nno one imagined that any one would dare to use it unauthorised. She\r\nreached _Malanotte_ a little before the carriage: when it was near at\r\nhand, she left the litter; and making a sign to the coachman to stop,\r\napproached the window, and whispered in the ear of Nibbio the will of\r\nher master.\r\n\r\nLucy, sensible that the motion of the carriage had ceased, shook off the\r\nlethargy into which she had for some time been plunged, and in an agony\r\nof terror looked around her. Nibbio had drawn himself back on the seat,\r\nand the old woman, resting her chin on the window, said to Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nmy child; come, poor girl; come with me. I have orders to treat you\r\nkindly, and to offer you every consolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of a female voice the unfortunate girl felt a momentary\r\nrelief, which was, however, succeeded by deeper terror as she looked at\r\nthe person from whom it proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, anxiously\r\nfixing her eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, poor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old woman.\r\n\r\nNibbio and his two companions, inferring the designs of their master\r\nfrom the extraordinary deportment of the old woman, endeavoured to\r\npersuade the poor girl to obey; but Lucy kept gazing at the wild and\r\nsavage solitude around, which left her no ray of hope. However, she\r\nattempted to cry out; but seeing Nibbio give a look to the handkerchief,\r\nshe stopped, trembled, was seized, and then placed in the litter. The\r\nold woman was placed beside her; and Nibbio left the two villains for\r\ntheir escort, and hastened forward at the call of his master. Lucy,\r\naroused to momentary energy by the near approach of the deformed and\r\nwithered features of her companion, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I? Where are you\r\ntaking me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo one who wishes you well; to a great\xe2\x80\x94you are a lucky girl; be happy,\r\ndo not be afraid; be happy. He has told me to encourage you; you will\r\ntell him that I have done so, will you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this man? What is he? What does he want with me? I do not belong\r\nto him. Tell me where I am. Let me go. Tell these men to let me go, to\r\ntake me to some church. Oh, you, who are a woman, in the name of the\r\nholy Virgin, I entreat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis holy and tender name, so often pronounced with respect in her early\r\nyears, and for so long a time neglected and forgotten, produced on the\r\nmind of the wretched woman, who had not heard it for so long a time, a\r\nconfused impression, like the remembrance of lights and shadows on the\r\nmind of one blind from infancy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Unknown, standing at the door of the castle, looked below,\r\nand saw the litter slowly ascending, and Nibbio walking a few steps in\r\nadvance of it. At the sight of his master, he hurried forward. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the signor to him, and led the way to an inner hall. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, stopping.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAll has been done according to your wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Nibbio, bowing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe order in time, the young girl in time, no\r\none near the place, a single cry, no one alarmed, the coachman diligent,\r\nthe horses swift; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, to say truth, I would rather have received orders to plunge a\r\ndagger in her heart at once, than to have been obliged to look at her,\r\nand hear her entreaties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this? What is this? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say that during the whole journey\xe2\x80\x94yes, during the whole\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x94she has excited my compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompassion! What dost thou know of compassion? What _is_ compassion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never understood what it is until to-day; it is something like\r\nfear; if it takes possession of one, one is no longer a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear, then, what she has done to excite your compassion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, most illustrious signor, she wept, implored, and looked so\r\npiteously; then turned pale, pale as death; then wept, and prayed again,\r\nand said such words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not have this girl in the castle,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Unknown. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nwrong to embark in this business; but I have promised, I have promised:\r\nwhen she is far away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And looking imperiously at Nibbio, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cput an end to your compassion; mount a horse, take with you two or\r\nthree companions, if you wish; go to the castle of Don Roderick, thou\r\nknowest it. Tell him to send immediately, immediately\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut another _No_, more imperious than the first, whose sound was heard\r\nin the depth of his soul, prevented his proceeding. \xe2\x80\x9c_No_,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a\r\ndetermined tone, as if expressing the command of this secret\r\nvoice,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_no_; go to bed; and to-morrow morning you shall do what I\r\nshall then order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis girl must have some demon who protects her,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, as he\r\nremained alone, with his arms crossed on his breast, regarding the\r\nfitful shadows cast by the rays of the moon on the floor, which darted\r\nthrough the grating of the lofty windows. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must have some demon or\r\nan angel who protects her. Compassion in Nibbio! To-morrow morning,\r\nto-morrow morning at the latest, she shall be sent away; she must submit\r\nto her destiny, that is certain. And,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, with the tone of\r\none who gives a command to a wayward child, under the conviction that he\r\nwill not obey it, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will think of it no more. This animal Don Roderick\r\nmust not come to torment me with thanks, for\xe2\x80\x94I do not wish to hear her\r\nspoken of. I have served him\xe2\x80\x94because I promised to do so; and I\r\npromised, because it was my destiny. But Don Roderick shall pay me with\r\nusury. Let us see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he endeavoured to imagine some difficult enterprise in which to\r\nengage Don Roderick as a punishment; but his thoughts involuntarily\r\nrecurred to another subject. \xe2\x80\x9cCompassion in Nibbio! What has she done? I\r\nmust see her. No! Yes! I must see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed through several halls, and arriving at the apartment of the\r\nold woman, knocked with his foot at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of this voice, the old woman quickly obeyed, and flung the\r\ndoor wide open. The Unknown threw a glance around the chamber, and by\r\nthe light of the lantern, which stood on the table, saw Lucy on the\r\nfloor in one corner of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you place her there?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a frowning brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe placed herself there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done all I\r\ncould to encourage her; but she will not listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Lucy, who, at the noise of his step, and at the sound\r\nof his voice, had been seized with new terror. She buried her face in\r\nher hands, and remained silent and trembling before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise; I will not harm you; I can befriend you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the signor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he, in a voice of thunder, irritated at having spoken\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nAs if alarm had restored her exhausted strength, the unfortunate girl\r\nfell on her knees, clasped her hands on her breast, as if before a\r\nsacred image, then with her eyes fixed on the earth, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHere I\r\nam, murder me if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told you that I will not harm you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Unknown,\r\nin a more gentle tone, gazing at her agonised and altered features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, courage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe tells you himself that he\r\nwill not harm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lucy, in a voice in which indignation and despair\r\nwere mingled with alarm and dismay,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy make me suffer the torments of\r\nhell? What have I done to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they have not treated you kindly? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, kindly treated! They have brought me hither by treachery and force.\r\nWhy, why did they bring me? Why am I here? Where am I? I am a poor\r\ncreature. What have I done to you? In the name of God\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod! God! always God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who are too weak to\r\ndefend themselves, always make use of the name of God, as if they knew\r\nsomething concerning him! What! do you mean by this word to make me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he left the sentence unfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, signor, what could I mean, a poor girl like me, except that you\r\nshould have pity on me? God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy!\r\nLet me go; for pity, for charity, let me go. Do not make a poor creature\r\nsuffer thus! Oh, you, who have it in your power, tell them to let me go.\r\nThey brought me hither by force. Put me again in the carriage with this\r\nwoman, and let it carry me to my mother. O holy Virgin! My mother! my\r\nmother! Perhaps she is not far from here\xe2\x80\x94I thought I saw my mountains!\r\nWhy do you make me suffer? Carry me to a church; I will pray for you all\r\nmy life. Does it cost you so much to say one word? Oh, I see that you\r\nare touched! Say but the word, say it. God pardons so many deeds for one\r\nact of mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why is she not the daughter of one of the cowards who outlawed\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Unknown. \xe2\x80\x9cI should then enjoy her sufferings; but\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not stifle so good an inspiration,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Lucy, on seeing\r\nhesitation in the countenance of her persecutor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not grant me\r\nmercy, the Lord will; he will send death to relieve me, and all will be\r\nover. But you\xe2\x80\x94one day, perhaps, you also\xe2\x80\x94but no, no\xe2\x80\x94I will pray the\r\nLord to preserve you from evil. What would it cost you to say one word?\r\nIf ever you experience these torments\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, take courage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown, with a gentleness that\r\nastonished the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I done you any harm? Have I menaced\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. I see that you have a good heart, and that you pity a poor\r\ncreature. If you chose, you could alarm me more than any of them, you\r\ncould make me die with fear; and on the contrary, you have\xe2\x80\x94you have\r\ngiven me some consolation. God reward you! Accomplish the work you have\r\nbegun; save me, save me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, save me now, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning I will see you again, I tell you. Be of good courage.\r\nRest yourself. You must need food; it shall be brought to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I shall die if any one comes into this room, I shall die. Take\r\nme away, God will reward you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA servant will bring you something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, turning to the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cpersuade her to eat, and\r\nto repose on the bed. If she consents to have you sleep with her, well;\r\nif not, you can sleep very well on the floor. Be kind to her, I say; and\r\ntake care that she makes no complaint of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastily quitted the room, before Lucy could renew her entreaties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, miserable that I am! Shut, shut the door!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, returning to\r\nseat herself in her corner. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, miserable that I am! Who shall I\r\nimplore now? Where am I? Tell me, tell me, for charity, who is this\r\nsignor? Who has been talking to me? who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he? Do you wish me to tell you? you must wait awhile first. You\r\nare proud, because he protects you; provided you are satisfied, no\r\nmatter what becomes of me. Ask _him_ his name. If I should tell you, he\r\nwould not speak to me so gently as he did to you. I am an old woman, I\r\nam an old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, grumbling: but hearing the sobs of\r\nLucy, she remembered the threat of her master; and addressing her in a\r\nless bitter tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! I have said no harm. Be cheerful. Do not ask me\r\nwhat I cannot tell you, but have courage. How satisfied most people\r\nwould be, should he speak to them as he has spoken to you! Be cheerful!\r\nDirectly, you shall have something to eat; and from what he said, I know\r\nit will be something good. And then, you must lie down, and you will\r\nleave a little room for me,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, with an accent of suppressed\r\nrancour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot eat; I cannot sleep. Leave me, approach me not. You will not\r\ngo away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, seating herself on a large arm-chair, and\r\nregarding her with a mingled expression of alarm and rage. She looked at\r\nthe bed, and did not very well relish the idea of being banished from it\r\nfor the night, as it was very cold; but she hoped at least for a good\r\nsupper. Lucy felt neither cold nor hunger; she remained stupified with\r\ngrief and terror; her ideas became vague and confused as in the delirium\r\nof a fever.\r\n\r\nShe shuddered at hearing a knock at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho is there? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let any one come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only Martha, bringing something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut, shut the door!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman. Taking a basket from the hands of\r\nMartha, she placed it on the table, and closed the door. She invited\r\nLucy to taste the delicious food, bestowing on it profuse praises, and\r\non the wine too, which was such as the signor himself drank with his\r\nfriends; but seeing that they were useless she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your own\r\nfault, you _must_ not forget to tell him that I asked you. I will eat,\r\nhowever, and leave enough for you, if you should come to your senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhen her supper was finished she approached Lucy again, and renewed her\r\nsolicitations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I wish nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, in a faint and exhausted voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the door shut?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with momentary energy; \xe2\x80\x9cis it well\r\nsecured?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman approached the door, and showed her that it was firmly\r\nbolted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is well fastened. Are you satisfied\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! satisfied! satisfied! in this place!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, sinking into her\r\ncorner. \xe2\x80\x9cBut God knows that I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to bed. What would you do there, lying like a dog? How silly to\r\nrefuse comforts when you can have them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, leave me to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, remember it is your own fault; if you wish to come to bed, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x94I have left room enough for you; remember I have asked you very\r\noften.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus saying, she drew the clothes over her, and soon all was\r\nprofound silence.\r\n\r\nLucy remained motionless, with her face buried in her hands, which\r\nrested on her knees; she was neither awake nor asleep, but in a dreamy\r\nstate of the imagination, painful, vague, and changeful. At first, she\r\nrecalled with something of self-possession the minutest circumstances of\r\nthis horrible day; then her reason for a moment forsook its throne,\r\nvainly struggling against the phantoms conjured by uncertainty and\r\nterror; at last, weary and exhausted, she sunk on the floor, in a state\r\napproaching to, and resembling, sleep. But suddenly she awoke, as at an\r\ninternal call, and strove to recall her scattered senses, to know where\r\nshe was, and why she had been brought thither. She heard a noise, and\r\nlistened; it was the heavy breathing of the old woman, in a deep\r\nslumber; she opened her eyes on the objects around her, which the\r\nflickering of the lamp, now dying in its socket, rendered confused and\r\nindistinct. But soon her recent impressions returned distinctly to her\r\nmind, and the unfortunate girl recognised her prison; and with the\r\nknowledge came associated all the terrors of this horrible day; and,\r\novercome anew by anxiety and terror, she wished earnestly for death.\r\nShe could only pray, and as the words fell from her trembling lips, she\r\nfelt her confidence revive. Suddenly a thought presented itself to her\r\nmind; that her prayer would be more acceptable if united with an\r\noffering of something dear to her; she remembered the object to which\r\nshe had clung for her happiness, and resolved to sacrifice it; then\r\nclasping her hands over her chaplet, which hung upon her neck, and\r\nraising her tearful eyes to heaven, she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cO most holy Virgin! thou\r\nto whom I have so often prayed, and who hast so often consoled me\xe2\x80\x94thou\r\nwho hast suffered so much sorrow, and art now so glorious\xe2\x80\x94thou who hast\r\nperformed so many miracles for the afflicted\xe2\x80\x94holy Virgin! succour me,\r\ntake me from this peril, mother of God! return me safely to my mother,\r\nand I pledge myself to remain devoted to thy service; I renounce for\r\never the unfortunate youth, and from this time devote myself to thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter this consecration of herself, she felt her confidence and faith\r\nincrease; she remembered the \xe2\x80\x9c_to-morrow morning_\xe2\x80\x9d uttered by the\r\nUnknown, and took it as a promise of safety. Her wearied senses yielded\r\nto this new sentiment, and she slept profoundly and peacefully with the\r\nname of her protectress on her lips.\r\n\r\nBut in this same castle was one who could not sleep: after having\r\nquitted Lucy, and given orders for her supper, he had visited the posts\r\nof his fortress; but her image remained stamped on his mind, her words\r\nstill resounded in his ears. He retired to his chamber, and threw\r\nhimself on his bed; but in the stillness around this same image of Lucy\r\nin her desolation and anguish took possession still more absolutely of\r\nhis thoughts, and rendered sleep hopeless. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat new feelings are\r\nthese?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cNibbio was right; but what is there in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntears to unman me thus? Did I never see a woman weep before? Ay, and how\r\noften have I beheld their deepest agonies unmoved? But now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here he recalled, without much difficulty, many an instance when\r\nneither prayers nor tears were able to make him swerve from his\r\natrocious purposes; but instead of deriving augmented resolution, as he\r\nhad hoped, from the recollection, he experienced an emotion of alarm, of\r\nconsternation; so that even, as a relief from the torment of\r\nretrospection, he thought of Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe lives still,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is\r\nhere; there is yet time. I have it in my power to say to her, Go in\r\npeace! I can also ask her forgiveness. Forgiveness! I ask forgiveness of\r\na woman! Ah, if in that word existed the power to drive this demon from\r\nmy soul, I would say it; yes, I feel that I would say it. To what am I\r\nreduced? I am no longer myself! Well, well! many a time have such\r\nfollies passed through my head; this will take its flight also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd to procure the desired forgetfulness, he endeavoured to busy himself\r\nwith some new project; but in vain: all appeared changed! that which at\r\nanother time would have been a stimulus to action, had now lost its\r\ncharm; his imagination was overwhelmed with the insupportable weight of\r\nremembered crimes. Even the idea of continuing to associate with those\r\nwhom he had employed as the instruments of his daring and licentious\r\nwill was revolting to his soul; and, disgusted and weary, he found\r\nrelief only in the thought that by the dawn of morning he would set at\r\nliberty the unfortunate Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will save her; yes, I will save her. As soon as the day breaks, I\r\nwill fly to her, and say, Go, go in peace. But my promise! Ay, who is\r\nDon Roderick that I should hold sacred a promise made to _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthe perplexity of a man to whom a superior addresses unexpectedly an\r\nembarrassing question, the Unknown endeavoured to reply to this his own,\r\nor, rather, that was whispered by this new principle, that had of a\r\nsudden sprung up so awfully in his soul, to pass judgment upon him. He\r\nwondered how he could have resolved to engage himself to inflict\r\nsuffering, without any motive of hatred or fear, on an unfortunate being\r\nwhom he did not know, only to render a service to this man. He could not\r\nfind any excuse for it; he could not even imagine how he had been led to\r\ndo it. The hasty determination had been the impulse of a mind obedient\r\nto its habitual feelings, the consequence of a thousand previous deeds;\r\nand from an examination of the motives which had led him to commit a\r\nsingle deed, he was led to the retrospection of his whole life.\r\n\r\nIn looking back from year to year, from enterprise to enterprise, from\r\ncrime to crime, from blood to blood, each one of his actions appeared\r\nabstracted from the feelings which had induced their perpetration, and\r\ntherefore exposed in all their horrible deformity, but which those\r\nfeelings had hitherto veiled from his view. They were all his own, he\r\nwas responsible for all; they comprised his life; the horror of this\r\nthought filled him with despair; he grasped his pistol, and raised it to\r\nhis head\xe2\x80\x94but at the moment in which he would have terminated his\r\nmiserable existence, his thoughts rushed onwards to the time that must\r\ncontinue to flow on after his end. He thought of his disfigured corpse,\r\nwithout sense or motion, in the power of the vilest men; the\r\nastonishment and confusion which would take place in the castle, the\r\nconversation it would excite in the neighbourhood and afar off, and,\r\nmore than all, the rejoicing of his enemies. The darkness and silence of\r\nthe night inspired him with other apprehensions still; it appeared to\r\nhim that he would not have hesitated to perform the deed in open day, in\r\nthe presence of others. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, after all, what was it? but a moment, and\r\nall would be over.\xe2\x80\x9d And now another thought rose to his mind: \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\r\nother life, of which they tell, is an invention of priests, is a mere\r\nfabrication, why should I die? Of what consequence is all that I have\r\ndone? It is a trifle\xe2\x80\x94but if there should be another life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt such a doubt, he was filled with deeper despair, a despair from which\r\ndeath appeared no refuge. The pistol dropped from his grasp\xe2\x80\x94both hands\r\nwere applied to his aching head\xe2\x80\x94and he trembled in every limb. Suddenly\r\nthe words he had heard a few hours before came to his memory, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\npardons so many deeds for one act of mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d They did not come to him\r\nclothed in the humble tone of supplication, with which he had heard them\r\npronounced, but in one of authority which offered some gleam of hope. It\r\nwas a moment of relief: he brought to mind the figure of Lucy, when she\r\nuttered them; and he regarded her, not as a suppliant, but as an angel\r\nof consolation. He waited with anxiety the approach of day, that he\r\nmight hear from her mouth other words of hope and life. He imagined\r\nhimself conducting her to her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, what shall I do\r\nto-morrow? what shall I do for the rest of the day? what shall I do the\r\nday after, and the next day? and the night? the night which will so soon\r\nreturn? Oh, the night! let me not think of the night!\xe2\x80\x9d And, plunged in\r\nthe frightful void of the future, he sought in vain for some employment\r\nof time, some method of living through the days and nights. Now he\r\nthought of abandoning his castle, and flying to some distant country,\r\nwhere he had never been heard of; but, could he fly from himself? Then\r\nhe felt a confused hope of recovering his former courage and habits; and\r\nthat he should regard these terrors of his soul but as a transient\r\ndelirium: now, he dreaded the approach of day, which should exhibit him\r\nso miserably changed to his followers; then he longed for its light, as\r\nif it would bring light also to his troubled thoughts. As the day broke,\r\na confused sound of merriment broke upon his ear. He listened; it was a\r\ndistant chiming of bells, and he could hear the echo of the mountains\r\nrepeat the harmony, and mingle itself with it. From another quarter,\r\nstill nearer, and then from another, similar sounds were heard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nmeans this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cFor what are these rejoicings? What joyful event\r\nhas taken place?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose from his bed of thorns, and opened the window.\r\n\r\nThe mountains were still half veiled in darkness, the heavens appeared\r\nenveloped in a heavy and vast cloud; but he distinguished, through the\r\nfaint dawn of the morning, crowds passing towards the opening on the\r\nright of the castle, villagers in their holyday garments. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are\r\nthose people doing? what has happened to cause all this joy?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\ncalling a bravo, who slept in the adjoining room, he asked him the cause\r\nof the commotion. The man replied that he was ignorant of it, but would\r\ngo immediately and enquire. His master remained at the window,\r\ncontemplating the moving spectacle, which increasing day rendered more\r\ndistinct every moment. He saw crowds passing in succession; men, women,\r\nand children, as guided by one impulse, directing their steps in one\r\ndirection. They appeared animated by a common joy; and the bells, with\r\ntheir united sound of merriment, seemed to be an echo of the general\r\nhilarity. The Unknown looked on intently, and felt an eager curiosity to\r\nknow what could have communicated such happiness to such a multitude of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bravo hastened back with the intelligence, that the Cardinal\r\nFrederick Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, had arrived the evening before\r\nat ***, and was expected to pass the day there. The report of his\r\narrival being spread abroad, the people had been seized with a desire to\r\nsee him; and the bells were rung in testimony of the happiness his\r\npresence conferred, and also to give wider notice of his arrival. The\r\nUnknown, left alone, continued to look down into the valley\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFor a man!\r\nall crowding, all eager to see a man! And, nevertheless, each one of\r\nthem has some demon that torments him; but none, none, a demon like\r\nmine; not one has passed such a night as I have. What is there in this\r\nman to excite such joy? Some silver which he will scatter among\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x94But _all_ are not actuated by such a motive. Well, a few\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94Oh! if he had a few words of consolation for me! Yes\xe2\x80\x94why should\r\nI not go to him? Why not? I _will_ go. What better can I do? I will go\r\nand speak to him; speak to him alone. What shall I say to him? Why, why,\r\nthat which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I will hear what he will say to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving come to this vague determination, he threw over his shoulders a\r\nmilitary cloak, put his pistol and dagger in his girdle, and took from\r\nthe wall, where it hung, a carabine almost as famous as himself; thus\r\naccoutred, he proceeded to Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and leaving his carabine at\r\nthe door, he knocked and demanded admittance. The old woman hastened to\r\nopen the door; he entered, and looking around the room saw Lucy tranquil\r\nand silent in the corner of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you suffer her to\r\nsleep there? Were these my orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did all I could; but she would neither eat nor come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her sleep then in peace; be careful not to trouble her, and when\r\nshe wakes\xe2\x80\x94Martha will be in the next chamber, and you must send her for\r\nwhatever she may want\xe2\x80\x94when she wakes\xe2\x80\x94tell her I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94that the signor has\r\ngone out for a little while, that he will return, and that\xe2\x80\x94he will do\r\nall that she wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman was astonished; \xe2\x80\x9cShe must be some princess,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown departed, took his carabine, gave orders to Martha to be in\r\nwaiting, and to a bravo to guard the chamber, and not suffer any one to\r\napproach; then leaving the castle, with rapid steps he descended into\r\nthe valley. The bravoes whom he met ascending the hill, stopped\r\nrespectfully at his approach, expecting and awaiting orders for some\r\nexpedition, and were astonished at his whole appearance, and the looks\r\nwith which he returned their salute.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the public road, his presence made a very different\r\nimpression; at his approach every one gave way, regarding him with looks\r\nof suspicion and wonder; each individual whom he met, cast at him a\r\ntroubled look, bowed, and slackened his pace, in order to remain behind.\r\nHe arrived at the village in the midst of the throng; his name quickly\r\nspread from mouth to mouth, and a passage was instantly made for him to\r\npass. He enquired of one near him where the cardinal was. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the house\r\nof the curate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the person, respectfully pointing to it. He went\r\nto it, entered a small court where there were several priests, who\r\nlooked at him with astonishment and suspicion. He saw, opposite to him,\r\na door open, which led to a small hall, in which were also a great\r\ncollection of priests. He left his carabine in a corner of the court,\r\nand entered the hall. He was received here, likewise, with doubting\r\nlooks, and whispers; and his name was repeated with infinite awe. He\r\naccosted one of them, asking to be directed to the cardinal, as he\r\nwished to speak with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the priest; and looking around upon the\r\nassembly, he called the cross-bearer, who at the time was saying to one\r\nnear him, \xe2\x80\x9cHe here!\xe2\x80\x94the famous\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94What can have brought him here? Make\r\nroom!\xe2\x80\x9d At this call, which resounded in the general silence, he felt\r\nhimself compelled to advance. He bowed before the Unknown, raised his\r\neyes in uneasy curiosity to his face, and understanding his request, he\r\nstammered out, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know if his illustrious lordship\xe2\x80\x94at this\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x94however, I will go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went, against his\r\nwill, to carry the message to the cardinal.\r\n\r\nAt this period of our history we cannot do otherwise than rest a while,\r\nas the traveller worn out and weary with a long journey through a\r\nsterile and savage land, refreshes himself for a season under the shade\r\nof a tree, near a fountain of living water. We are about to introduce a\r\nperson whose name and memory cause an emotion of respect and sympathy;\r\nand this emotion is the more grateful from our previous contemplation of\r\nwickedness and crime. We trust our readers will excuse our devoting a\r\nfew moments to this great and good man.\r\n\r\nFrederick Borromeo, born in the year 1564, was one of those rare\r\ncharacters who have employed a fine genius, the resources of great\r\nwealth, the advantages of privileged rank, and unceasing industry, for\r\nthe discovery and practice of that which was for the good of mankind.\r\nHis life was like a stream, which, issuing limpid from its native rock,\r\nmoves on undefiled over various lands; and, clear and limpid still,\r\nunites itself with the ocean. In the midst of the pomps and pleasures of\r\nthe world, he applied himself from his earliest youth to study and obey\r\nthe precepts of religion; and this application produced in his heart its\r\nlegitimate fruits. He took truth for the rule of his thoughts and\r\nactions. He was taught by it not to look upon this life as a burthen to\r\nthe many, and a pleasure to the few; but as a scene of activity for all,\r\nand of which all must render their account; and the chief aim of his\r\nthoughts had ever been to render his life useful and holy.\r\n\r\nIn 1580, he declared his resolution to devote himself to the ministry of\r\nthe church, and he took the habit from the hands of his cousin Carlos,\r\nwhom the public voice, even to the present day, has uniformly\r\nacknowledged as a saint.[31] He entered a short time after into the\r\ncollege at Pavia, founded by that holy man, and which still bears the\r\nname of the family. There, whilst applying himself with assiduity to the\r\noccupations prescribed by its rules, he voluntarily imposed on himself,\r\nin addition, the task of instructing the poor and ignorant in the\r\nprinciples of the Christian religion, and of visiting, consoling, and\r\naiding the sick. He made use of the authority which was conceded to him\r\nby all, to induce his companions to second him in these deeds of\r\nbenevolence; he steadily refused all worldly advantages, and led a life\r\nof self-denial and devotion to the cause of religion and virtue. The\r\ncomplaints of his kindred, who thought the dignity of the house degraded\r\nby his plain and simple habits of life, were unavailing. He had another\r\nconflict to sustain with the ecclesiastical authorities, who wished to\r\nimpel him forward to distinction, and make him appear as the prince of\r\nthe place. From all this, however, he carefully withdrew himself,\r\nalthough at the time but a youth.\r\n\r\n      [31] Saint Charles Borromeo.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been astonishing that, during the life of his cousin\r\nCarlos, Frederick should have imitated the example and followed the\r\ncounsel of so good a man; but it was surprising, that after his death no\r\none could perceive that Frederick, although only twenty years of age,\r\nhad lost his guardian and guide. The increasing splendour of his\r\ntalents, his piety, the support of many powerful cardinals, the\r\nauthority of his family, the name itself, to which Carlos had caused to\r\nbe associated an idea of sanctity and sacerdotal superiority, all\r\nconcurred to point him out as a proper subject for ecclesiastical\r\ndignity. But he, persuaded in the depth of his soul of that which no\r\ntrue Christian can deny, that a man has no real superiority over\r\nothers, but in devotion to their good, dreaded distinction, and sought\r\nto avoid it. He did not wish to escape from the obligation to serve his\r\nneighbour; his life was but one scene of such services; but he did not\r\nesteem himself worthy of so high and responsible an office. Governed by\r\nsuch feelings, in 1595, when Clement VIII. offered him the archbishopric\r\nof Milan, he refused it without hesitation, but was finally obliged to\r\nyield to the express command of the pope.\r\n\r\nSuch demonstrations are neither difficult nor rare; it is no greater\r\neffort for hypocrisy to assume them, than for raillery to deride them.\r\nBut are they not also the natural expression of wise and virtuous\r\nfeeling? The life is the test of sincerity; and though all the\r\nhypocrites in the world had assumed the expression of virtuous\r\nsentiments, yet the sentiments themselves will always command our\r\nrespect and veneration, when their genuineness is evinced by a life of\r\ndisinterestedness and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFrederick, as archbishop, was careful to reserve for himself only that\r\nwhich was barely necessary, of his time and his wealth: he said, as all\r\nthe world says, that the ecclesiastical revenues are the patrimony of\r\nthe poor; and we shall see how he put this maxim in practice. He caused\r\nan estimate to be made of the sum necessary for his expenses, and for\r\nthose employed in his service: finding it to be 600 sequins, he ordered\r\nthat amount to be taken from his patrimonial revenues for the supply of\r\nhis table. He exercised such minute economy with regard to himself, that\r\nhe did not relinquish any article of dress until it was entirely worn\r\nout; but he joined to these habits of extreme simplicity, an exquisite\r\nneatness, which was remarkable in this age of luxury and uncleanliness.\r\nHe did more: in order that nothing should be lost from the fragments of\r\nhis frugal table, he assigned them to a hospital for the poor, and a\r\nservant came every day to gather the remnants for that purpose. From the\r\nattention which he paid to such minuti\xc3\xa6, we might form a contracted idea\r\nof his mind, as being incapable of elevating itself to more extensive\r\ndesigns, were it not for the Ambrosian library, which remains a monument\r\nof his liberality and magnificence. To furnish it with books and\r\nmanuscripts, besides those which he had already collected, he sent eight\r\nof the most skilful and learned men to make purchases of them in France,\r\nSpain, Germany, Italy, Flanders, Greece, Lebanon, and Jerusalem. He\r\nsucceeded in collecting 30,000 printed volumes, and 14,000 manuscripts.\r\nHe joined to the library a college of doctors: these doctors were nine\r\nin number, and supported by him as long as he lived; after his death,\r\nthe ordinary revenues not being sufficient for the expense, they were\r\nreduced to two. Their duty consisted in the cultivation of the various\r\nbranches of human knowledge, theology, history, belles lettres,\r\necclesiastical antiquities, and Oriental languages. Each one was obliged\r\nto publish some work on the subject to which he had particularly applied\r\nhimself. He added to this a college, which he called _Trilingue_[32],\r\nfor the study of the Greek, Latin, and Italian languages; and a college\r\nof pupils, who were instructed in these languages to become professors\r\nin their turn. He united to these also a printing establishment for the\r\nOriental languages, for Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, Persian, and Armenian;\r\na gallery of pictures, and another of statues; and a school for the\r\nthree principal arts of design. For the latter, he was at no loss to\r\nfind professors; but this was not the case with regard to the Eastern\r\nlanguages, which were at this time but little cultivated in Europe. In\r\nthe orders which he left for the government and regulations of the\r\nlibrary, we perceive a perpetual attention to utility, admirable in\r\nitself, and much in advance of the ordinary ideas of his time. He\r\nprescribed to the librarian the cultivation of a regular correspondence\r\nwith the learned men of Europe, to keep himself acquainted with the\r\nstate of science, and to procure every new and important work; he also\r\ncharged him to point out to young students the books necessary for them,\r\nand, whether natives or foreigners, to afford them every possible\r\nfacility in making use of those of the library. There is a history of\r\nthe Ambrosian library by one Pierpaolo Bosca, who was librarian after\r\nthe death of Frederick, in which all the excellent regulations are\r\nminutely detailed. Other libraries existed in Italy, but with little\r\nbenefit to the studious: the books were carefully concealed from view in\r\ntheir cases, and inaccessible to all, except on rare occasions, and with\r\nthe utmost difficulty. A book might then be seen, but not studied. It is\r\nuseless to enquire what were the fruits of these establishments of\r\nBorromeo, but we must admire the generosity, judgment, and benevolence\r\nof the man who could undertake and execute such things, in the midst of\r\nthe ignorance, inertness, and general indifference which surrounded him.\r\nAnd in attention to public, he was not unmindful of private benevolence;\r\nindeed, his whole life was a perpetual almsgiving; on the occasion of\r\nthe famine of which our history has spoken, we may have to relate more\r\nthan one instance of his wisdom and generosity.\r\n\r\n      [32] Three languages.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible charity of the man shone as much in his private\r\ncharities, as in his splendid and magnificent public establishments\r\nalready recorded. On one occasion he saved a young lady from being\r\nimmured in a convent against her wish. Her selfish father pretended he\r\ncould not marry her suitably without a portion of 4000 crowns. The\r\nbishop advanced the money.\r\n\r\nEasy of access, he made it a principle to receive the poor who applied\r\nto him, with kindness and affection. And on this point he was obliged to\r\ndispute with the nobility, who wished to keep him to their standard of\r\naction. One day, whilst visiting among the mountaineers, and instructing\r\nsome poor children, Frederick bestowed caresses on them. A nobleman who\r\nwas present, warned him to be careful, as the children were dirty and\r\ndisgusting. The good bishop, not without indignation, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nsouls are committed to my care; these children may never see me again;\r\nand are you not willing that I should embrace them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, however, seldom felt indignation or anger: he was admired for a\r\nplacability, a sweetness of manner nearly imperturbable; which, however,\r\nwas not natural to him, but the effect of continual combat against a\r\nquick and hasty disposition. If ever he appeared harsh, it was to those\r\nsubordinate pastors, whom he found guilty of avarice, or negligence, or\r\nany other vice opposed to the spirit of their high calling. With regard\r\nto his own interests or temporal glory, he exhibited no emotion, either\r\nof joy or regret; admirable indeed, if his spirit was in reality not\r\naffected by these emotions; but more admirable still, if viewed as the\r\nresult of continued and unremitted effort to subdue them. And amidst all\r\nthe important cares with which he was occupied, he did not neglect the\r\ncultivation of his mind; he devoted himself to literature with so much\r\nardour, that he became one of the most learned men of his time.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, conceal that he adopted with firm persuasion, and\r\nmaintained with constancy, certain opinions, which at this day would\r\nappear singular and ill-founded; these, however, were the errors of his\r\ntime, and not his own.\r\n\r\nOur readers may perhaps enquire, if so learned and studious a man has\r\nleft no monument of his labours and studies? His works, great and small,\r\nLatin and Italian, printed as well as manuscript, amount to more than a\r\nhundred; they are preserved with care in the library which he founded.\r\nThey are composed of moral treatises, sermons, historical dissertations,\r\nsacred and profane antiquities, literature, the fine arts, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the reason that they are so little known, so little sought\r\nfor? We cannot enter into the causes of this phenomenon, as our\r\nexplanation might not be satisfactory to our readers. So that we had\r\nbetter resume the course of our history, in relating facts concerning\r\nthis extraordinary man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Frederick was engaged in study, as was his custom,\r\npreparatory to the hour of divine service, when the cross-bearer\r\nentered, with a disturbed and unquiet air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange visit,\xe2\x80\x94strange indeed, most illustrious signor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the signor \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chaplain; pronouncing the name which\r\nwe are unable to repeat to our readers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is without, in person, and\r\nasks admittance to the presence of your lordship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, closing his book and rising from his seat,\r\nhis countenance brightening; \xe2\x80\x9clet him come in, let him come in\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chaplain, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes your lordship know who this man\r\nis? It is the famous outlaw \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it not a happy circumstance for a bishop, that such a man should\r\nhave come to seek him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the chaplain, \xe2\x80\x9cwe never dare speak of certain\r\nthings, because my lord says they are idle tales. However, in this case\r\nit appears to be a duty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Zeal makes enemies, my lord, and we know\r\nthat more than one ruffian has boasted that sooner or later\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have they done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man is an enterprising, desperate villain, who is in strict\r\ncorrespondence with other villains, as desperate as himself, and who,\r\nperhaps, have sent him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what discipline is this!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cthe soldiers\r\nexhort the general to cowardice!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, with a grave and pensive air, he\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Carlo would not have deliberated a moment, whether he\r\nshould receive such a man; he would have gone to seek him. Let him enter\r\nimmediately; he has already waited too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chaplain moved towards the door, saying in his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\nremedy; these saints are always obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and reaching the hall, where he had left the\r\necclesiastics, he beheld them collected together in one corner of the\r\nroom, and the Unknown standing alone in another. As he approached him,\r\nhe eyed him keenly to ascertain whether he had not arms concealed about\r\nhis person. \xe2\x80\x9cTruly, before introducing him, we might at least\r\npropose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d but his resolution failed him. He spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord expects\r\nyour lordship. Be kind enough to come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d And he led the way into\r\nthe presence of Frederick, who came forward to meet the Unknown with a\r\npleased and serene countenance, making a sign to the chaplain to quit\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown and the cardinal remained for some moments silent and\r\nundecided; the former experienced at the same time a vague hope of\r\nfinding some relief to his internal torments, and also a degree of\r\nirritation and shame at appearing in this place as a penitent, to\r\nconfess his sins, and implore pardon of a man. He could not speak;\r\nindeed, he hardly wished to do so. However, as he raised his eyes to the\r\ncardinal\xe2\x80\x99s face, he was seized with an irresistible sentiment of\r\nrespect, which increasing his confidence, and subduing his pride without\r\noffending it, nevertheless kept him silent.\r\n\r\nThe person of Frederick was indeed fitted to inspire respect and love.\r\nHis figure was naturally majestic and noble, and was neither bent nor\r\nwasted by years; his eye was grave and piercing, his brow serene and\r\npensive; his countenance still shone with the animation of youth,\r\nnotwithstanding the paleness of his face, and the visible traces it\r\npresented of abstinence, meditation, and laborious exertion. All his\r\nfeatures indicated that he had once been more than ordinarily handsome;\r\nthe habit of solemn and benevolent thought, the internal peace of a long\r\nlife, love for mankind, and the influence of an ineffable hope, had\r\nsubstituted for the beauty of youth, the more dignified and superior\r\nbeauty of an old age, to which the magnificent simplicity of the\r\n_purple_ added an imposing and inexpressible charm. He kept his eyes for\r\na few moments fixed on the Unknown, as if to read his thoughts; and\r\nimagining he perceived in his dark and troubled features something\r\ncorresponding to the hope he had conceived, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he in an\r\nanimated voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a welcome visit is this! and how I ought to thank\r\nyou for it, although it fills me with self-reproach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReproach!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Unknown, in astonishment; but he felt re-assured\r\nby his manner, and the gentleness of his words, and he was glad that the\r\ncardinal had broken the ice, and commenced the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, it is a subject of self-reproach that I should have waited\r\ntill you came to me! How many times I might, and ought to have sought\r\n_you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! seek _me_! Do you know who I am? Have they told you my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe I could have felt this joy, which you may read in my\r\ncountenance\xe2\x80\x94do you believe I could have felt it, at the sight of one\r\nunknown to me? It is you who are the cause of it\xe2\x80\x94you, whom it was my\r\nduty to seek\xe2\x80\x94you, for whom I have so wept and prayed\xe2\x80\x94you, who are that\r\none of my children (and I love them all with the whole strength of my\r\naffections)\xe2\x80\x94that one, whom I would most have desired to see and\r\nembrace, if I could have ever dared to indulge the hope of so doing. But\r\nGod alone can work miracles, and he supplies the weakness and tardiness\r\nof his poor servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Unknown was amazed at the kindness and warmth of this reception;\r\nagitated and bewildered by such unlooked-for benevolence, he kept\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Frederick, more affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have some good news\r\nfor me; why do you hesitate to tell it me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news! I! I have hell in my soul, and how can I bring _you_ good\r\nnews! Tell me, tell me, if you know, what good news could you expect\r\nfrom such a one as I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat God has touched your heart, and is drawing you to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the cardinal calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod! God! If I could see! If I could hear him! Where is God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ask me? you! And who more than yourself has felt his presence?\r\nDo you not now feel him in your heart, disturbing, agitating you, not\r\nleaving you a moment of repose, and at the same time drawing you towards\r\nhim, and imparting a hope of tranquillity and of consolation; of\r\nconsolation which shall be full and unlimited, as soon as you\r\nacknowledge _Him_, confess your sins, and implore his mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, yes; something indeed oppresses, something consumes me. But\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94if it be God, if it be He, of whom you speak, what can he do with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered in a tone of despair; but Frederick calmly and\r\nsolemnly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can God do with you? Through you he can exhibit\r\nhis power and goodness. He would draw from you a glory, which none other\r\ncould render him; you, against whom, the cries of the world have been\r\nfor so long a time raised\xe2\x80\x94you, whose deeds are detested\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (The\r\nUnknown started at this unaccustomed language, but was astonished to\r\nfind that it excited no anger in his bosom, but rather communicated to\r\nit a degree of alleviation.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat glory,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\naccrue to God? A general cry of supplication has risen against you\r\nbefore his throne; among your accusers, some no doubt have been\r\nstimulated by jealousy of the power you have exercised; but more, by the\r\ndeplorable security of your own heart, which has endured until this day.\r\nBut, when _you_ yourself shall rise to condemn your life, and become\r\nyour own accuser, then, oh! then, God will be glorified! And you ask\r\nwhat he can do with you? What am I, feeble mortal! that I should presume\r\nto tell you what are his designs respecting you; what he will do with\r\nthis impetuous will, and imperturbable constancy, when he shall have\r\nanimated and warmed it with love, hope, and repentance? Who are you,\r\nfeeble mortal, that you should think yourself able to execute and\r\nimagine greater things for the promotion of evil and vice, than God can\r\nmake you accomplish for that of good and virtue? What can God do with\r\nyou? Forgive you! save you! accomplish in you the work of redemption!\r\nAre not these things worthy of him? Oh! speak. If I, an humble\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x94I, so miserable, and nevertheless so full of myself\xe2\x80\x94I, such\r\nas I am,\xe2\x80\x94if I so rejoice at your salvation, that to assure it, I would\r\njoyfully give (God is my witness) the few years that remain to me in\r\nlife, Oh! think! what must be the love of Him who inspires me with the\r\nthought, and commands me to regard you with such devotion as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe countenance and manner of Frederick breathed celestial purity and\r\nlove, in accordance with the vows which came from his mouth. The Unknown\r\nfelt the stormy emotions of his soul gradually calming under such\r\nheavenly influence, and giving place to sentiments of deep and profound\r\ninterest. His eyes, which from infancy \xe2\x80\x9chad been unused to tears, became\r\nswoln;\xe2\x80\x9d and burying his face in his hands, he wept the reply he could\r\nnot utter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat and good God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frederick, raising his hands and eyes to\r\nheaven, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have I ever done\xe2\x80\x94I, thy unprofitable servant\xe2\x80\x94that thou\r\nshouldst have invited me to this banquet of thy grace,\xe2\x80\x94that thou\r\nshouldst have thought me worthy of being thy instrument to the\r\naccomplishment of such a miracle!\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he extended his hand to\r\ntake that of the Unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cno! Approach me not! Pollute not that innocent and\r\nbeneficent hand! You know not what deeds have been committed by the hand\r\nyou would place within your own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, taking it with gentle violence,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csuffer me to\r\nclasp this hand, which is about to repair so many wrongs, to scatter so\r\nmany blessings; which will comfort so many who are in affliction, which\r\nwill offer itself, peaceably and humbly, to so many enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown, sobbing aloud; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me, my lord!\r\ngood Frederick! leave me! Crowds eagerly await your presence, among whom\r\nare pure and innocent souls, who have come from far to see and hear you,\r\nand you remain here to converse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94with whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will leave the ninety and nine sheep,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nare in safety on the mountain. I must now remain with the one which was\r\nlost. These people are perhaps now more satisfied than if they had the\r\npoor bishop with them; perhaps God, who has visited you with the riches\r\nand wonders of his grace, may even now be filling their hearts with a\r\njoy, of which they divine not the cause; perhaps they are united to us\r\nwithout knowing it; perhaps the Holy Spirit animates their hearts with\r\nthe fervour of charity and benevolence; inspires them with a spirit of\r\nprayer; with, on your account, a spirit of thanksgiving of which you are\r\nthe unknown object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he passed his arm around the neck of the Unknown, who, after\r\nresisting a moment, yielded, quite vanquished by this impulse of\r\nkindness, and fell on the neck of the cardinal, in an agony of\r\nrepentance. His burning tears dropped on the stainless purple of\r\nFrederick, and the pure hands of the bishop were clasped affectionately\r\naround him, who had hitherto been only habituated to deeds of violence\r\nand treachery.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown, after a long embrace, covering his face with his hands,\r\nraised his head, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! God! Thou who art truly great and\r\ngood! I know myself now; I comprehend what I am; my iniquities are all\r\nbefore me; I abhor myself; but still\xe2\x80\x94still I experience a consolation,\r\na joy\xe2\x80\x94yes, a joy which I have never before known in all my horrible\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod accords to you this grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cto attract you to his\r\nservice, to strengthen you to enter resolutely the new way he has opened\r\nto you, where you have so much to undo, to repair, to weep for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is so much\xe2\x80\x94so much\xe2\x80\x94that I can\r\nonly weep over. But at least, there are some things but just undertaken,\r\nthat I can arrest\xe2\x80\x94yes, there is at least one evil that I can repair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then briefly related, in the most energetic terms of self-execration,\r\nthe story of Lucy, with the sufferings and terrors of the unfortunate\r\ngirl; her entreaties, and the species of frenzy that her supplications\r\nhad excited in his soul; adding, that she was still in the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! let us lose no time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frederick, moved with pity and\r\nsolicitude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happiness for you! You may behold in this, the pledge\r\nof pardon! God makes you the instrument of safety to her, to whom you\r\nwere to have been the instrument of ruin. God has indeed blessed\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x94Do you know the native place of the unhappy girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Unknown named the village.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not far from this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised! And\r\nprobably\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d so saying, he approached a table, and rang a little bell.\r\nThe chaplain entered, with an unquiet look; in amazement he beheld the\r\naltered countenance of the Unknown, on which the traces of tears were\r\nstill visible; and glancing at that of the cardinal, he perceived,\r\nthrough its wonted calmness, an expression of great satisfaction,\r\nmingled with extraordinary solicitude. He was roused from the\r\nastonishment which the contemplation excited, by a question of the\r\ncardinal, if, among the curates in the hall, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was one from ***?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, most illustrious lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chaplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring him hither immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cand with him, the\r\ncurate of this parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chaplain obeyed, and went to the hall where the priests were\r\nassembled. All eyes were turned towards him. He cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cHis most\r\nillustrious and reverend lordship asks for the curate of this parish and\r\nthe curate of ***.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe former advanced immediately, and at the same time was heard, amidst\r\nthe crowd, a _me?_ uttered in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not the curate of ***?\xe2\x80\x9d said the chaplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis most illustrious and reverend lordship asks for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, and Don Abbondio advanced from the crowd with an air\r\nof amazement and anxiety. The chaplain led the way, and introduced them\r\nboth to the presence of the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal let go the hand of the Unknown as they entered, and taking\r\nthe curate of the parish aside, related in few words the facts of the\r\nstory, asking him if he knew some kind female, who would be willing to\r\ngo to the castle in a litter, to remove Lucy thence; a devoted,\r\ncharitable woman, capable of acting with judgment in so novel an\r\nexpedition, and of exerting the best means to tranquillise the poor\r\ngirl, to whom deliverance itself, after such anguish and alarm, might\r\nproduce new and overwhelming apprehensions. After having reflected a\r\nmoment, the curate took upon himself the affair, and departed. The\r\ncardinal then ordered the chaplain to have a litter prepared, and two\r\nmules ready saddled. The chaplain quitted the room to obey his orders,\r\nand the cardinal was left alone with Don Abbondio and the Unknown. The\r\nformer, who had kept himself aloof, regarding with eager curiosity the\r\nfaces of the Unknown and the cardinal, now came forward, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ntold that your illustrious lordship wished to see me; but I suppose it\r\nwas a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mistake;\xe2\x80\x9d replied Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have both a novel and\r\nagreeable commission to give you. One of your parishioners, whom you\r\nhave regarded as lost, Lucy Mondella, is found; she is near this, in the\r\nhouse of my good friend here. I wish you to go with him, and a good\r\nwoman whom the curate of this parish will provide, and bring the poor\r\ngirl, who must be so dear to you, to this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio did his best to conceal the extreme alarm which such a\r\nproposition caused him; and bowed profoundly, in sign of obedience,\r\nfirst to the cardinal, and then to the Unknown, but with a piteous look,\r\nwhich seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am in your hands; be merciful: _parcere\r\nsubjectis_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal asked him of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s relations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has no near relation but her mother, with whom she lives,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nDon Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _she_ at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cthis poor child cannot yet go home, it\r\nwould be a great consolation for her to see her mother; if the curate of\r\nthis village does not return before I go to church, I beg you will\r\ndesire him to send some prudent person to bring the good woman hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I had better go myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I have other employment for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mother,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9cis a very sensitive woman, and it\r\nwill require a good deal of discretion to prepare her for the meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the reason that I have named some prudent person. You, however,\r\nwill be more useful elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal. He could have\r\nadded, had he not been deterred by a regard to the feelings of the\r\nUnknown\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis poor child needs much to behold some person whom she\r\nknows, after so many hours of alarm, and in such terrible uncertainty of\r\nthe future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared strange, however, that Don Abbondio should not have inferred\r\nit from his manner, or that he should not have thought so himself; the\r\nreluctance he evinced to comply with the request of the cardinal\r\nappeared so out of place, that the latter imagined there must be some\r\nsecret cause for it. He looked at the curate attentively, and quickly\r\ndiscovering the fears of the poor man at becoming the companion of this\r\nformidable lord, or entering his abode, even for a few moments, he felt\r\nan anxiety to dissipate these terrors; and in order to do this, and not\r\ninjure the feelings of his new friend by talking privately to Don\r\nAbbondio in his presence, he addressed his conversation to the Unknown\r\nhimself, so that Don Abbondio might perceive by his answers, that he was\r\nno longer a man to be feared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall be satisfied with this visit\r\nto-day. You will return, will you not, in company with this worthy\r\necclesiastic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ I return!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Unknown: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! if ever you should refuse\r\nto see me, I would remain at your door as a beggar. I must talk to you,\r\nI must hear you, I must see you, I cannot do without you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrederick took his hand, and pressing it affectionately, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo us\r\nthe favour, then, the curate of the village and myself, to dine with us;\r\nI shall expect you. In the mean time, whilst you are gathering the first\r\nfruits of repentance and compassion, I will go and offer supplications\r\nand thanksgivings to God with the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio, at this exhibition of confidence and affection, was like a\r\ntimid child, who beholds a man caressing fearlessly a rough-looking\r\nmastiff, renowned for his ferocity and strength. It is in vain that the\r\nmaster assures him the dog is a good quiet beast: he looks at him,\r\nneither contradicting nor assenting; he looks at the dog, and dares not\r\napproach him, lest the good beast might show his teeth, if only from\r\nhabit; he dares not retreat, from fear of the imputation of cowardice;\r\nbut he heartily wishes himself safe \xe2\x80\x9cat home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, as he was quitting the room, still holding the Unknown by\r\nthe hand, perceived that the curate remained behind, embarrassed and\r\nmotionless, and thinking that perhaps he was mortified at the little\r\nattention that was paid to him, compared with that which was bestowed on\r\none so criminal, he turned towards him, stopped a moment, and with an\r\namiable smile said, \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Curate, you have always been with me in the\r\nhouse of our Father; but this man _perierat, et inventus est_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how I rejoice at it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, bowing to them both very\r\nreverently.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop passed on, and entering the hall, the admirable pair\r\npresented themselves to the eager gaze of the clergy who were there\r\nassembled. They regarded with intense curiosity those two countenances,\r\non which were depicted different, but equally profound emotions. The\r\nvenerable features of Frederick breathed a grateful and humble joy; in\r\nthose of the Unknown might be traced an embarrassment blended with\r\nsatisfaction, an unusual modesty, a keen remorse, through which,\r\nhowever, the lingerings of his severe and savage nature were apparent.\r\nMore than one of the spectators thought of that passage of Isaiah, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with\r\nthe kid.\xe2\x80\x9d Behind them came Don Abbondio, whom no one noticed.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the apartment, the servant of the\r\ncardinal entered, to inform him that he had executed the orders of the\r\nchaplain, that the litter was ready, and that they only waited for the\r\nfemale whom the curate was to bring. The cardinal told him to inform Don\r\nAbbondio when the curate should have arrived, and that afterwards all\r\nwould be subject to his orders and those of the Unknown, to whom he bade\r\nan affectionate farewell, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall expect you.\xe2\x80\x9d Bowing to Don\r\nAbbondio, he directed his steps, followed by the clergy in procession,\r\nto the church.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio and the Unknown were left alone in the apartment; the\r\nlatter was absorbed in his own thoughts, impatient for the moment to\r\narrive when he should take _his_ Lucy from sorrow and prison; for she\r\nwas indeed _his_ Lucy, but in a sense very different from the preceding\r\nnight. His countenance expressed concentrated agitation, which to the\r\nsuspicious eye of Don Abbondio appeared something worse: he looked at\r\nhim with a desire to begin a friendly conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I say\r\nto him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I repeat to him that I rejoice? I rejoice!\r\nat what? That having been a demon, he has formed the resolution to\r\nbecome an honest man? A pretty salutation, indeed! Eh! eh! _however_ I\r\nshould arrange my words, my _I rejoice_ would signify nothing else! And\r\ncan one believe that he has become an honest man all in a moment!\r\nAssertions prove nothing; it is so easy to make them! But, nevertheless,\r\nI must go with him to the castle! Oh! who would have told me this, this\r\nmorning! Oh! if ever I am so happy as to get home again, Perpetua shall\r\nanswer for having urged me to come here! Oh! miserable that I am! I must\r\nhowever say something to this man!\xe2\x80\x9d He had at least thought of something\r\nto say,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI never expected the pleasure of being in such respectable\r\ncompany,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and had opened his mouth to speak, when the servant entered\r\nwith the curate of the village, who informed them that the good woman\r\nwas in the litter awaiting them. Don Abbondio, approaching the servant,\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a gentle beast, for, to say truth, I am not a\r\nskilful horseman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quite easy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the valet, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the mule of the\r\nsecretary, a grave man of letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio, and continued to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven preserve\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Unknown had advanced towards the door, but looking back, and seeing\r\nDon Abbondio behind, he suddenly recollected himself, and bowing with a\r\npolite and humble air, waited to let him pass before. This circumstance\r\nre-assured the poor man a little; but he had scarcely reached the little\r\ncourt, when he saw the Unknown resume his carbine, and fling it over his\r\nshoulder, as if performing the military exercise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does he want with this tool?\r\nThat is a strange ornament for a converted person! And if some whim\r\nshould enter his head! what would become of me! what would become of\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the Unknown had had the least suspicion of the thoughts that were\r\npassing in the mind of his companion, he would have done his utmost to\r\ninspire him with confidence; but he was far from such an imagination, as\r\nDon Abbondio was very careful not to let his distrust appear.\r\n\r\nThey found the mules ready at the door: the Unknown mounted one which\r\nwas presented to him by a groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she not vicious in the least?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Abbondio of the servant,\r\nwith his foot in the stirrup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quite easy, she is a lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. Don Abbondio climbed to the\r\nsaddle, by the aid of the servant, and was at last safely mounted.\r\n\r\nThe litter, which was a few steps in advance, moved at a call from the\r\ndriver, and the convoy departed.\r\n\r\nThey had to pass before the church, which was crowded with people, and\r\nthrough a small square, which was filled with villagers from abroad, who\r\nhad not been able to find a place within the walls of the church. The\r\nreport had already spread; and when they saw the carriage appear, and\r\nbeheld the man who a few hours before had been the object of terror and\r\nexecration, a confused murmur of applause rose from the crowd. They made\r\nway to let him pass; at the same time each one endeavoured to obtain a\r\nsight of him. When he arrived in front of the church, he took off his\r\nhat, and bowed his head in reverence, amidst the tumultuous din of many\r\nvoices, which exclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d Don Abbondio took off his hat\r\nalso, bent his head, and commended himself to the protection of heaven;\r\nand, hearing the voices of his brethren in the choir, he could not\r\nrestrain his tears.\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the open country, in the windings of the almost\r\ndeserted road, a darker veil came over his thoughts; there was nothing\r\nthat he could regard with confidence but the driver, who, belonging to\r\nthe establishment of the cardinal, must certainly be honest, and\r\nmoreover did not look like a coward. From time to time they passed\r\ntravellers crowding to see the cardinal. The sight of them was a\r\ntransient balm to Don Abbondio; but still he approached this formidable\r\nvalley, where they would meet none but the vassals of the Unknown! And\r\nwhat vassals! He desired more than ever to enter into conversation with\r\nhis companion, to keep him in good humour; but, seeing him preoccupied,\r\nhe dared not attempt to interrupt his thoughts. He was then obliged to\r\nhold colloquy with himself, of which we will transcribe a part for the\r\nbenefit of the reader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not an astonishing thing that the saints, as well as the wicked,\r\nhave always quicksilver in their veins; and, not contented with making a\r\nbustle themselves, they would make all mankind, if they could, join the\r\ndance with them! Is there not a fatality in it, that the most\r\ntroublesome come to me,\xe2\x80\x94to me who never meddled with any body; they\r\ntake me almost by the hair, and thrust me into their concerns! me! who\r\ndesire nothing, but to live tranquilly, if they will let me do so. This\r\nmad knave Don Roderick. What was there wanting to make him the happiest\r\nman in the world, but a little prudence? He is rich, young, respected,\r\ncourted; but happiness is a burthen to him, it seems; so that he must\r\nseek trouble for himself and his neighbour. He must set up, forsooth,\r\nfor a molester of women,\xe2\x80\x94the most silly, the most villanous, the most\r\ninsane conduct in the world. He might ride to paradise in a coach; and\r\nhe prefers to go halting to the devil\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling. And this man before\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, regarding him as if he feared he could hear his\r\nthoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cand this man, after having, by his villanies, turned the\r\nworld upside down, now turns it upside down by his conversion\xe2\x80\x94if he is\r\nreally converted! Meanwhile, it is I who am to put it to the test! Some\r\npeople always want to make a noise! Is it so difficult to act an honest\r\npart, all one\xe2\x80\x99s life, as I have? Not at all! but they prefer to murder,\r\nkill, and play the devil.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! unhappy man that I am! they must always\r\nbe in a bustle, even in doing penance! just as if one could not repent\r\nat home, in private, without so much noise,\xe2\x80\x94without giving others so\r\nmuch trouble.\xe2\x80\x94And his illustrious lordship! to receive him all at once\r\nwith open arms; to call him his dear friend, his worthy friend; to\r\nlisten to his least words as if he had seen him work miracles, to give\r\nhim his public approbation to assist him in all his undertakings; I\r\nshould call this precipitation! And without any pledge or security, to\r\nplace a poor curate in his hands! A holy bishop\xe2\x80\x94and he is such\r\nassuredly\xe2\x80\x94a holy bishop should regard his curates as the apple of his\r\neye. A little prudence, a little coolness, a little charity, are things\r\nwhich, in my opinion, are not inconsistent with sanctity. And should\r\nthis be all hypocrisy? Who can tell the designs of such a man? To think\r\nthat I must accompany him into the castle? There must be some deviltry\r\nin it! Am I not unhappy enough? Let me not think of it. But how has Lucy\r\nfallen into the clutches of this man? It is a secret between him and my\r\nlord the cardinal, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t deign to inform me concerning it: I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care to meddle with the affairs of others, but when one\xe2\x80\x99s life is\r\nin danger one has a right to know something.\xe2\x80\x94But poor Lucy\xe2\x80\x94I shall be\r\nsatisfied if she escapes. Heaven knows what she has suffered. I pity\r\nher, but she was born to be my ruin. And if this man is really\r\nconverted, what need has he of me? Oh! what a chaos! But Heaven owes me\r\nits protection, since I did not get myself into the difficulty. If I\r\ncould only read in the countenance of this man what passes in his soul!\r\nLook at him; now he looks like Saint Anthony in the desert, and now like\r\nHolofernes himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn truth, the thoughts which agitated the Unknown passed over his\r\ncountenance, as in a stormy day the clouds fly over the face of the sun,\r\nproducing a succession of light and shade. His soul, calmed by the\r\ngentle language of Frederick, felt elated at the hope of mercy, pardon,\r\nand love; but then he sank again under the weight of the terrible past.\r\nAgitated and uneasy, he retraced in his memory those iniquities which\r\nwere reparable, and considered what remedies would be the safest and\r\nquickest. And this unfortunate girl! how much she has suffered! how much\r\nhe had caused her to suffer! At this thought his impatience to deliver\r\nher increased, and he made a sign to the coachman to hasten.\r\n\r\nThey entered at last into the valley. In what a situation was now our\r\npoor Don Abbondio! to find himself in this famous valley, of which he\r\nhad heard such black and horrible tales. These famous men, the flower\r\nof the bravoes of Italy, these men without pity or fear, to see them in\r\nflesh and blood,\xe2\x80\x94to meet them at every step! They bowed, it is true,\r\nrespectfully, in the presence of their lord, but who knows what passed\r\nin their hearts, and what wicked design against the poor priest might,\r\neven then, be forming in their brains.\r\n\r\nThey reached _Malanotte_; bravoes were at the door, who bowed to the\r\nUnknown, glancing with eager curiosity at his companion, and the litter.\r\nIf the departure of their master alone, at the break of day, had been\r\nregarded as extraordinary, his return was considered not less so. Is it\r\na prize which he conducts? And how has he taken possession of it alone?\r\nAnd what is this strange litter? And whose is this livery? They did not\r\nstir, however; knowing, from the countenance of their master, that their\r\nsilence was what he desired.\r\n\r\nThey reached the castle; the bravoes who were on the esplanade and at\r\nthe door, retired on both sides to leave the passage free. The Unknown\r\nmade a sign to them not to go farther off. Spurring his mule, he passed\r\nbefore the litter, and beckoning to Don Abbondio and the coachman to\r\nfollow him, he entered a first court, and thence a second: approaching a\r\nsmall door, and with a gesture keeping back a bravo, who advanced to\r\nhold his stirrup, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cRemain there yourself, and let none approach\r\nnearer.\xe2\x80\x9d He dismounted, and with the reins in his hand, drew near the\r\nwoman, who had withdrawn the curtains of the litter, saying to her in a\r\nlow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHasten to comfort her; and make her understand at once that\r\nshe is free, and with friends. God will reward you!\xe2\x80\x9d He then advanced to\r\nthe curate, and helping him to dismount, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Curate, I will\r\nnot ask your forgiveness for the trouble you have taken on my account;\r\nyou suffer for one who will reward you well, and for this poor girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis countenance not less than his words restored the courage of Don\r\nAbbondio; drawing a full breath, which had been long pent up in his\r\nbreast, he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship jests, surely? But\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\naccepting the hand offered to him so courteously, he slid from the\r\nsaddle. The Unknown took the bridle, and gave both animals to the care\r\nof the driver, ordering him to wait there until their return. Taking a\r\nkey from his pocket, he opened the little door, and followed by his two\r\ncompanions, the curate and the female, ascended the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy had just risen. She was endeavouring to collect her senses, to\r\nseparate the turbid visions of sleep from the remembrance of the sad\r\nreality, which appeared to her a dismal dream, when the old woman, in a\r\nvoice which she meant to be humble and gentle, said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you\r\nhave slept! You would have done better to go to bed; I told you so a\r\nhundred times.\xe2\x80\x9d Receiving no answer, she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cEat a little; you\r\nhave need of something; if you do not, he will complain of me when he\r\nreturns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I wish to go to my mother. Your master promised me, he said,\r\n_to-morrow morning_. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone away; but he left word that he would return soon, and do\r\nall that you should desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say so? did he say so? Well; I wish to go to my mother, now,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard steps in the adjoining chamber, and a knock at the\r\ndoor. The old woman demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the well-known voice.\r\n\r\nThe old woman drew the bolt, and holding the door open, the Unknown let\r\nDon Abbondio and the good woman pass in; then closing the door, and\r\nremaining outside himself, he sent away the old woman to a distant part\r\nof the castle. The first appearance of other persons increased the\r\nagitation of Lucy, to whom any change brought an accession of alarm. She\r\nlooked, and beholding a priest and a female, felt somewhat reassured;\r\nshe looked again! Can it be? Recognising Don Abbondio, her eyes remained\r\nfixed as by the wand of an enchanter. The kind woman bent over her, and\r\nwith an affectionate and anxious countenance, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlas! my poor\r\nchild! come, come with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy,\xe2\x80\x94but, without waiting her reply, she turned\r\nagain to Don Abbondio, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it you? Is it you indeed, Signor\r\nCurate? Where are we? Oh! unhappy girl! I am no longer in my right\r\nmind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it is I, in truth; take courage. We have come to take you away.\r\nI am indeed your curate, come for this purpose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if restored to strength in an instant, Lucy stood up, and fixing her\r\neyes again on their faces, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Virgin has sent you, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it true, that we may go away? Is it true indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lucy,\r\nlowering her voice to a timid and fearful tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all these people,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued she, with her lips compressed, and trembling from alarm and\r\nhorror; \xe2\x80\x9cand this lord\xe2\x80\x94this man\xe2\x80\x94he promised me indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here also in person with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is without,\r\nexpecting us; let us go at once; we must not make such a man wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Unknown appeared at the door. Lucy, who, a few\r\nmoments before, had desired earnestly to see him\xe2\x80\x94nay, having no other\r\nhope in the world, had desired to see none but him\xe2\x80\x94now that she was so\r\nunexpectedly in the presence of friends, was, for a moment, overcome\r\nwith terror. Shuddering with horror, she hid her face on the shoulder of\r\nthe good dame. Beholding the innocent girl, on whom the evening before\r\nhe had not had resolution to fix his eyes; beholding her countenance,\r\npale, and changed, from fasting and prolonged suffering, the Unknown\r\nhesitated; but perceiving her impulse of terror, he cast down his eyes,\r\nand, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true! forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe comes to save you; he is not the same man; he has become good. Do\r\nyou hear him ask your forgiveness?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the dame in the ear of\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould any one say more? Come, lift up your head; do not play the child.\r\nWe can go away now, immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\nLucy raised her head, looked at the Unknown, and beholding his humble\r\nand downcast expression, she was affected with a mingled feeling of\r\ngratitude and pity: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my lord! may God reward you for your compassion\r\nto an unfortunate girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cand may he recompense you a\r\nhundred-fold for the consolation you afford me by these words!\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he advanced towards the door, and went out, followed by Lucy;\r\nwho, quite encouraged, was supported by the arm of the good lady, Don\r\nAbbondio bringing up the rear. They descended the stairs, passed through\r\nthe courts, and reached the litter; into which, the Unknown with almost\r\ntimid politeness (a new thing for him!) assisted Lucy and her new\r\ncompanion to enter. He then aided Don Abbondio to reseat himself in the\r\nsaddle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! what complaisance!\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, moving much more\r\nlightly than he had done on first mounting.\r\n\r\nThe convoy resumed their way; as soon as the Unknown was mounted, his\r\nhead was raised, and his countenance resumed its accustomed expression\r\nof command and authority. The robbers whom they met on their road\r\ndiscovered in it marks of strong thought and extraordinary solicitude;\r\nbut they did not, they could not, comprehend the cause. They knew\r\nnothing as yet of the great change which had taken place in the soul of\r\nthe man, and certainly such a conjecture would not have entered into\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nThe good dame hastened to draw the curtains around the litter; pressing\r\nthe hands of Lucy affectionately, she endeavoured to encourage her by\r\nwords of piety, congratulation, and tenderness. Seeing, however, that\r\nbesides the exhaustion from so much suffering, the confusion and\r\nobscurity of all that had happened prevented the poor girl from being\r\nalive to the satisfaction of her deliverance; she said what she thought\r\nwould be most likely to restore her thoughts to their ordinary course.\r\nShe mentioned the village to which she belonged, and towards which they\r\nwere hastening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, remembering that this village was but a short\r\ndistance from her own. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! holy Virgin! I render thee thanks. My\r\nmother! my mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will send for her immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend, not knowing that it\r\nhad already been done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; God will reward you. And you,\xe2\x80\x94who are you? How is it that\r\nyou have come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur curate sent me, because this lord, whose heart God has touched,\r\n(blessed be his holy name!) came to our village to see the cardinal\r\narchbishop, who is visiting among us, the dear man of God! This lord has\r\nrepented of his horrible sins, and wishes to change his life; and he\r\ntold the cardinal that he had carried off an innocent girl, with the\r\nconnivance of another, whose name the curate did not mention to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy raised her eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the lord cardinal\r\nthought, that a young girl being in the question, a female should be\r\nfound to accompany her; he told the curate to look for one, and the\r\ncurate kindly came to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! may God reward you for your goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the curate desired me to encourage you, my poor child, to relieve\r\nyou from uneasiness at once, and to make you understand, how the Lord\r\nhas miraculously preserved you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! miraculously indeed, through the intercession of the Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to comfort you, to advise you to pardon him who has done you\r\nthis evil, to rejoice that God has shown compassion towards him, and\r\neven to pray for him; for, besides its being a duty, you will derive\r\ncomfort from it to your own heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy replied with a look which expressed assent as clearly as if she had\r\nmade use of words, and with a sweetness which words could not have\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorthy young woman!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the friend. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as your curate was also\r\nin our village, the lord cardinal judged it best to send him with us,\r\nthinking that he might be of some assistance. I had already heard that\r\nhe was a poor sort of a timid man; and on this occasion, he has been\r\nwholly taken up with himself, like a hen with one chick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94he who is thus changed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! do you not know?\xe2\x80\x9d said the good dame, repeating his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! merciful heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy. For many times had she heard this\r\nname repeated with horror, in more than one story, in which he had\r\nappeared like the _Ogre_ of the fairy tale. At the idea of having been\r\nin his terrible power, and of now being under his protection,\xe2\x80\x94at the\r\nthought of such peril, and such deliverance, in reflecting who this man\r\nwas that had appeared to her so ferocious, and then so humble and so\r\ngentle, she was lost in astonishment, and could only exclaim, from time\r\nto time, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! merciful Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is indeed a great mercy! it is a great happiness for half the\r\nworld in this neighbourhood, and afar off. When one thinks how many\r\npeople he kept in continual alarm; and now, as our curate says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nyou have only to look in his face to know that he is truly changed. And,\r\nbesides, by \xe2\x80\x98their works\xe2\x80\x99 ye shall know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe should not tell the truth, did we say that the good dame had no\r\ncuriosity to learn more of an affair in which she played so important a\r\npart; but, to her praise it must be added, that, feeling a respectful\r\npity for Lucy, and estimating the weight and dignity of the charge\r\nconfided to her, she did not for a moment think of asking her an\r\nindiscreet or idle question. All her discourse in their short journey\r\nwas composed of expressions of tenderness and interest for the poor\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be long since you have eaten any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not remember\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94It must indeed be some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child! you must need something to restore your strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt my house, thanks be to God, we shall find something presently. Be of\r\ngood cheer, it is but a short distance off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy, wearied and exhausted by her various emotions, fell languidly to\r\nthe bottom of the litter, overcome by drowsiness; and her kind companion\r\nleft her to a short repose.\r\n\r\nAs to Don Abbondio, the descent from the castle did not cause him so\r\nmuch fright as the ascent thither; but it was nevertheless not\r\nagreeable. When his alarm had first ceased, he felt relieved from an\r\nintolerable burthen; but he now began to torment himself in various\r\nways, and found materials for such an operation in the present as well\r\nas in the future. His manner of travelling, to which he was not\r\naccustomed, he found to be exceedingly unpleasant, especially in the\r\ndescent from the castle to the valley. The driver, obedient to a sign\r\nfrom the Unknown, made his beasts set off at a quick pace; the two mules\r\nkept up with the litter; and thus poor Don Abbondio, subjected to the\r\nunusual bounding and rebounding, which was more perilous from the\r\nsteepness of the declivity they were descending, was obliged to hold\r\nfast by the saddle in order to keep his seat, not daring to ask his\r\ncompanions to abate somewhat of their speed. Moreover, if the road lay\r\non a height, along a ridge, the mule, according to the custom of these\r\nanimals, would obstinately keep on the outside, and place his feet\r\nliterally on the very edge of the precipice. \xe2\x80\x9cThou also,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in his\r\nheart to the beast, \xe2\x80\x9cthou also hath this cursed desire to seek danger,\r\nwhen there are so many other paths!\xe2\x80\x9d He tightened the rein on the other\r\nside, but in vain; so that, although dying of vexation and fear, he\r\nsuffered himself, as was his custom, to be led by the will of another.\r\nThe bravoes no longer caused him much uneasiness now that he felt\r\nconfidence in their master. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, nevertheless, \xe2\x80\x9cif the\r\nnews of this great conversion spreads, while we are yet here, who knows\r\nhow these people may take it? Who knows what might be the result?\r\nPerhaps they might take it in their heads to think I had come as a\r\nmissionary! and then (heaven preserve me!) they would make me suffer\r\nmartyrdom!\xe2\x80\x9d But we have said enough of the terrors of Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\nThe company at last arrived at the extremity of the valley; the\r\ncountenance of the Unknown became more serene, and Don Abbondio\r\nrecovered in some degree his usual composure; but still his mind was\r\noccupied with more distant evils. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will this fool Don Roderick say?\r\nTo be exposed thus to scoffs and jests\xe2\x80\x94how sorely will he feel it!\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly play the devil outright! Perhaps he will seek another\r\nquarrel with me because I have been engaged in this cursed business!\r\nHaving had the heart to send those two demons to attack me in the road,\r\nwhat he will do now, heaven knows. He cannot molest my lord the\r\ncardinal, because he is obviously beyond his reach; he will be obliged\r\nto champ the bit. However, the poison will be in his veins, and he will\r\nneed to discharge it somewhere. It is well known how these affairs end;\r\nthe blows always fall on the weakest. The cardinal will busy himself\r\nwith placing Lucy in safety; this other poor devil is beyond his reach,\r\nbut what is to become of me? And what will the cardinal do to defend me,\r\nafter having engaged me in the business? Can he hinder this atrocious\r\nbeing from serving me a worse turn than before? And then he has so many\r\nthings to think of! he cannot pay attention to every body! They who do\r\ngood, do it in the gross, and enjoy their satisfaction without regarding\r\nminute consequences: but your evil-doer is more diligent; he lingers\r\nbehind till he sees the last result, because of the fear that torments\r\nhim. Shall I say I have acted by my lord archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s command, and\r\nagainst my own will? But it will seem that I favour villany! I\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\npleasure it gives me! Heaven forbid! but enough\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Perpetua the\r\nwhole story, and leave her to circulate it\xe2\x80\x94if indeed, his reverend\r\nlordship should not take up the fancy to make the whole matter public,\r\nand thrust me forward as a chief actor. However, I am determined on one\r\nthing: I will take leave of my lord the cardinal as soon as we arrive\r\nat the village, and go to my home. Lucy has no longer any need of me;\r\nshe is under good protection; and, after so many fatigues, I may claim\r\nthe right to take some repose.\xe2\x80\x94But, should my lord be seized with the\r\ndesire to know all her story, and I be compelled to relate the affair of\r\nthe marriage! there would then be nothing wanting to complete my misery.\r\nAnd if he should visit my parish! Oh! let come what will, I will not\r\ntorment myself beforehand! I have cares enough. For the present I shall\r\nshut myself up at home. But I foresee too well that my last days must be\r\npassed in trouble and vexation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little troop arrived before the services of the church were over;\r\nand passing, as they had previously done, through the crowd, they\r\nproceeded to the house of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s companion.\r\n\r\nHardly had Don Abbondio alighted from his mule, when, making the most\r\nprofuse compliments to the Unknown, he begged him to apologise for him\r\nto the cardinal, as he was obliged to return directly to his parish on\r\nsome urgent business. He then went in search of a staff that he had left\r\nin the hall, and which he was accustomed to call his horse, and\r\nproceeded homewards. The Unknown remained at the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nawaiting his return from the church.\r\n\r\nThe good dame hastened to procure Lucy some refreshment to recruit her\r\nexhausted powers; she put some dry branches under a kettle which she\r\nreplaced over the fire, and in which swam a good fowl; after having\r\nsuffered it to boil a moment, she filled a plate with the soup, and\r\noffered it to Lucy, congratulating herself that the affair had happened\r\non a day, when, as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cat was not on the hearth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nday of feasting for all the world,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept for those\r\nunfortunate creatures who can hardly obtain bread of vetches, and a\r\npolenta of millet; they hope, however, to receive something from our\r\ncharitable cardinal. As for us, thank heaven, we are not in that\r\nsituation; between the trade of my husband and a small piece of land, we\r\nmanage to live comfortably. Eat, then, poor child, with a good appetite;\r\nthe fowl will be done presently, and you shall have something better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe then set about making preparations for dinner for the family.\r\n\r\nAs Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s spirits and strength returned, the necessity of arranging her\r\ndress occurred to her mind; she therefore tied up her long disordered\r\ntresses, and adjusted the handkerchief about her neck; in doing this,\r\nher fingers entwined themselves in the chaplet, which was there\r\nsuspended: she gazed at it with much emotion, and the recollection of\r\nthe vow she had made, this recollection which had been suspended by so\r\nmany painful sensations, now rose clearly and distinctly to her mind.\r\nAll the newly-awakened powers of her soul were again in a moment\r\nsubdued. And if she had not been prepared for this by a life of\r\ninnocence, resignation, and confidence, the consternation she\r\nexperienced would have terminated in despair. After the first tumult of\r\nher thoughts had in some measure subsided, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! unhappy\r\ngirl! what have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut hardly had she pronounced the words, when she was terrified at\r\nhaving done so; she recalled all the circumstances of her vow, her\r\nintolerable anguish, without hope of human aid, the fervour of her\r\npetition, the fulness of resolution with which the promise had been\r\nmade; and to repent of this promise, after having obtained the favour\r\nshe had implored, appeared to her sacrilegious ingratitude, perfidy\r\ntowards God and the Virgin. It seemed to her that such infidelity would\r\ncertainly draw upon her new and more terrible evils, and if these should\r\nindeed be its consequences she could no longer hope for an answer to her\r\nprayers; she therefore hastened to abjure her momentary regret, and\r\ndrawing the chaplet reverently from her neck, and holding it in her\r\ntrembling hand, she confirmed her vow; at the same time fervently\r\npraying to God that he would grant her strength to fulfil it, and to\r\ndrive from her thoughts circumstances which might, if they did not move\r\nher resolution, still increase but too much the severity of the\r\nsacrifice. The absence of Renzo, without any probability of his return,\r\nwhich had at first been so bitter, appeared now to her a design of\r\nProvidence, to make the two events conduce to the same end, and she\r\nendeavoured to find in one a consolation for the other. She also\r\nremembered that Providence would, to finish the work, find means to make\r\nRenzo resigned, and cause him to forget\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But scarcely had this idea\r\nentered her mind, when a new terror overwhelmed her. Conscious that her\r\nheart had still need of repentance, the unfortunate girl again had\r\nrecourse to prayer, and mental conflict; and at length arose, if the\r\nexpression may be allowed, like a victor wearied and wounded, having\r\ndisarmed his enemy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly footsteps and joyous exclamations were heard; they proceeded\r\nfrom the children of the family, who were returning from church. Two\r\nlittle girls and a little boy ran into the room; stopping a moment to\r\neye the stranger, they then came to their mother, one asking the name of\r\ntheir unknown guest, another wanting to relate the wonders they had\r\nseen. The good dame replied to them all with \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet; silence!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmaster of the house then entered with a calmer step; but with joy\r\ndiffused over his countenance. He was the tailor of the village and its\r\nenvirons; a man who knew how to read, and who had even read, more than\r\nonce, the Legend of the Saints and the _Reali di Francia_; he was\r\nregarded by the peasants as a man of knowledge, and when they lavished\r\ntheir praises on him, he repelled them with much modesty, only saying\r\nthat he had indeed mistaken his vocation, and that, perhaps, if he had\r\nstudied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Notwithstanding this little vanity he was the best natured\r\nman in the world. He had been present when the curate requested his wife\r\nto undertake her benevolent journey, and had not only given his\r\napprobation, but would have added his own persuasions, if that had been\r\nnecessary; and now that the ceremonies of the church, and above all, the\r\nsermon of the cardinal, had given an impetus to his amiable feelings, he\r\nreturned home with an ardent desire to know if the enterprise had\r\nsucceeded, and to see the poor innocent girl in safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife to him as he entered, pointing to Lucy, who\r\nrose from her seat blushing, and stammering forth some apology. He\r\nadvanced towards her, and, with a friendly tone, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nwelcome! welcome! You bring the blessing of Heaven on this house! How\r\nglad I am to see you here! I knew that you would arrive safely to a\r\nhaven, because I have never known the Lord commence a miracle without\r\naccomplishing it; but I am well content to see you here. Poor child! It\r\nis a great thing however to have been the subject of a miracle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe must not believe he was the only one who characterised the event by\r\nthis term, and that because he had read the legendary. Throughout the\r\nvillage, and the surrounding country, it was spoken of in no other\r\nterms, as long as its remembrance lasted; and to say truth, if we regard\r\nits attendant circumstances, it would be difficult to find another name\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nHe then approached his wife, who was employed in taking the kettle from\r\noff the fire, and said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHas all gone well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I will tell you another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, at your leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was ready, the mistress of the house made Lucy sit down\r\nwith them at the table, and helping her to a wing of the chicken,\r\nentreated her to eat. The husband began to dilate with much animation on\r\nthe events of the day; not without many interruptions from the children,\r\nwho stood round the table eating their dinner, and who had seen too many\r\nextraordinary things to be satisfied with playing the part of mere\r\nlisteners. He described the solemn ceremonies, and then recurred to the\r\nmiraculous conversion; but that which had made the most impression on\r\nhis mind, and of which he spoke the oftenest, was the sermon of the\r\ncardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see him before the altar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ca lord like him, to see him\r\nbefore the altar, as a simple curate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that golden thing he had on his head,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the little\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, be quiet. When one thinks, I say, that a lord like him, a man so\r\nlearned, who, as they say, has read all the books in the world, a thing\r\nwhich no one else has done, not even in Milan; when one thinks that he\r\nhas adapted himself so to the comprehension of others, that every one\r\nunderstood him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other little chatterer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, be quiet. What did you understand, you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood that he explained the Gospel, instead of the curate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet. I do not say that he was understood by those only who know\r\nsomething, but even those who were the most stupid and ignorant, caught\r\nthe sense perfectly. You might go now, and ask them to repeat his\r\ndiscourse; perhaps they might not remember a single word, but they would\r\nhave its whole meaning in their head. And how easy it was to perceive\r\nthat he alluded to this _signor_, although he never pronounced his name!\r\nBut one might have guessed it from the tears which flowed from his eyes.\r\nAnd all the people wept\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little boy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why did they all cry like\r\nlittle children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet. And there are, nevertheless, hard hearts in this country. He\r\nhas made us feel that although there is a scarcity, we must return\r\nthanks to God, and be satisfied; be industrious; do what we can, and\r\nthen be content, because unhappiness does not consist at all in\r\nsuffering and poverty; unhappiness is the result of wicked actions.\r\nThese are not fine words merely; it is well known that he lives like a\r\npoor man, that he takes the bread from his mouth to give to those that\r\nare in need, when he might live an easier life than any one. Oh, then,\r\nthere is great satisfaction in hearing him speak. He is not like many\r\nothers, who say, \xe2\x80\x98Do as I say, and not as I do;\xe2\x80\x99 and besides, he has\r\nmade it very apparent, that those even who are not what they call\r\n_gentlemen_, but who have more than is necessary, are bound to impart to\r\nthose who are in want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here he stopped, as if pained by some recollection; after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilence, he filled a plate with meat from the table, and adding a loaf\r\nof bread to it, tied up the whole in a napkin. \xe2\x80\x9cTake that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\r\nthe oldest of the children, and putting in her other hand a bottle of\r\nwine, \xe2\x80\x9ccarry that to the widow Martha, and tell her to feast with her\r\nchildren. But be very careful what you say to her, don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be\r\ndoing a charity, and don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word of it, should you meet any one;\r\nand take care not to break any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy was touched, even to tears, and her soul was filled with a\r\ntenderness that withdrew her from the contemplation of her own sorrows.\r\nThe conversation of this worthy man had already imparted a relief, that\r\na direct appeal to her feelings would have failed to procure. Her\r\nspirit, yielding to the charm of the description of the august pomp of\r\nthe church, of the emotions of piety there excited, and partaking of the\r\nenthusiasm of the narrator, forgot its woes, and, when obliged to recur\r\nto them, felt itself strengthened. The thought even of the great\r\nsacrifice she had imposed on herself, without having lost its\r\nbitterness, had assumed the character of austere and solemn\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nA few moments after, the curate of the village entered, saying that he\r\nwas sent by the cardinal for intelligence concerning Lucy, and also to\r\ninform her that he desired to see her that day; then he thanked, in his\r\nlordship\xe2\x80\x99s name, her kind hosts for their benevolence and hospitality.\r\nAll three, moved to tears, could not find words to reply to such a\r\nmessage from such a person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your mother not yet arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate to Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she.\r\n\r\nLearning that the good archbishop had sent for her mother, that it was\r\nhis own kind thought, her heart was overpowered, she raised her apron to\r\nher eyes, and her tears continued to flow long after the departure of\r\nthe curate. As these tumultuous emotions, called forth by such\r\nunexpected benevolence, gradually subsided, the poor girl remembered\r\nthat she had expressly solicited this very happiness of again beholding\r\nher mother, as a condition to her vow. \xe2\x80\x9c_Return me safely to my\r\nmother._\xe2\x80\x9d These words recurred distinctly to her memory. She was\r\nconfirmed more than ever in her purpose to keep her vow, and repented\r\nagain bitterly of the regret which she had for a moment experienced.\r\n\r\nAgnes, indeed, even whilst they were speaking of her, was very near; it\r\nis easy to imagine the feelings of the poor woman at so unexpected an\r\ninvitation, at the intelligence, necessarily confused and incomplete, of\r\na peril which was passed, but of a frightful peril, of an obscure\r\nadventure, of which the messenger knew not the circumstances, and could\r\ngive no explanation, and for which she could find no clue from previous\r\nfacts. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, great God! ah, holy Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d escaped from her lips, mingled\r\nwith useless questions, during the journey. On the road she met Don\r\nAbbondio, who, by the aid of his staff, was travelling homewards.\r\nUttering an exclamation of surprise, Agnes made the driver stop. She\r\nalighted, and with the curate withdrew into a grove of chestnuts, which\r\nwas on the side of the road. Don Abbondio informed her of all he had\r\nseen and known: much obscurity still rested upon his statement, but at\r\nleast Agnes ascertained that Lucy was now in safety.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio then introduced another subject of conversation, and would\r\nhave given her ample instruction on the manner of conducting herself\r\nwith the archbishop, if he, as was probable, should wish to see her and\r\nher daughter. He said it would not answer for her to speak of the\r\nmarriage; but Agnes, perceiving that he spoke only from his own\r\ninterest, was determined to promise nothing, because she said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe had\r\nother things to think of,\xe2\x80\x9d and bidding him farewell, she proceeded on\r\nher journey.\r\n\r\nThe carriage at last reached the house of the tailor, and the mother and\r\ndaughter were folded in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. The good wife, who was the\r\nonly witness of the scene, endeavoured to soothe and calm their\r\nfeelings; and then prudently left them alone, saying that she would go\r\nand prepare a bed for them.\r\n\r\nTheir first tumultuous joy having in some measure subsided, Agnes\r\nrequested to hear the adventures of Lucy, who attempted to relate them;\r\nbut the reader knows that it was a history with which no one was\r\nentirely acquainted, and to Lucy herself there was much that was\r\ninexplicable, particularly the fatal coincidence of the carriage being\r\nat that place precisely at the moment that Lucy had gone there by an\r\nextraordinary chance. With regard to this, the mother and daughter lost\r\nthemselves in conjecture, without even approaching the real cause. As\r\nto the principal author of this plot, however, they neither of them\r\ndoubted that it was Don Roderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that firebrand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cbut his hour will come. God will\r\nreward him according to his works, and then he will know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, mother, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not wish harm to him! do not wish\r\nit to any one! If you knew what it is to suffer! if you had experienced\r\nit! No, no! rather let us pray to God and the Virgin for him, that God\r\nwould touch his heart as he has done that of the other lord, who was\r\nworse than he, and who is now a saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horror that Lucy felt in retracing events so painful and recent made\r\nher hesitate more than once. More than once she said she had not the\r\nheart to proceed, and, choked by her tears, she with difficulty went on\r\nwith her narrative. But she was embarrassed by a different sentiment at\r\na certain point of her recital, at the moment when she was about to\r\nspeak of her vow. She feared her mother would accuse her of imprudence\r\nand precipitation; she feared that she would, as she had done in the\r\naffair of the marriage, bring forward her broad rules of conscience, and\r\nmake them prevail; she feared that the poor woman would tell it to some\r\none in confidence, if it were only to gain light and advice, and thus\r\nrender it public. These reflections made Lucy experience insupportable\r\nshame, and an inexplicable repugnance to speak on the subject. She\r\ntherefore passed over in silence this important circumstance,\r\ndetermining in her heart to communicate it first to Father Christopher;\r\nbut how great was her sorrow at learning that he was no longer at the\r\nconvent, that he had been sent to a distant country, a country\r\ncalled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Renzo?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in safety, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be so, since every one says so. They say that he has certainly\r\ngone to Bergamo, but no one knows the place exactly, and there has been\r\nno intelligence from himself. He probably has not been able to find the\r\nmeans of informing us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he is in safety, God be thanked!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, commencing another\r\nsubject of conversation, which was, however, interrupted by an\r\nunexpected event\xe2\x80\x94the arrival of the cardinal archbishop.\r\n\r\nAfter having returned from the church, and having learnt from the\r\nUnknown the arrival of Lucy, he had seated himself at table, placing the\r\nUnknown on his right hand; the company was composed of a number of\r\npriests, who gazed earnestly at the countenance of their once formidable\r\ncompanion, so softened without weakness, so humbled without meanness,\r\nand compared it with the horrible idea they had so long entertained of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDinner being over, the Unknown and the cardinal retired together. After\r\na long interview, the former departed for his castle, and the latter\r\nsent for the curate of the parish, and requested him to conduct him to\r\nthe house where Lucy had received an asylum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the curate, \xe2\x80\x9csuffer me, suffer me. I will send\r\nfor the young girl and her mother, if she has arrived,\xe2\x80\x94the hosts\r\nthemselves, if my lord desires it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to go to them myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Frederick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity that you should inconvenience yourself; I will\r\nsend for them immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the curate, who did not understand\r\nthat, by this visit, the cardinal wished to do honour to misfortune,\r\ninnocence, hospitality, and to his own ministry. But the superior\r\nrepeating his desire, the inferior bowed, and they proceeded on their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen they appeared in the street, a crowd immediately collected around\r\nthem. The curate cried, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, back, keep off.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFrederick, \xe2\x80\x9csuffer them,\xe2\x80\x9d and he advanced, now raising his hands to\r\nbless the people, now lowering them to embrace the children, who\r\nobstructed his progress. They reached the house, and entered it, whilst\r\nthe crowd remained without. But amidst the throng was the tailor, who\r\nhad followed with others; his eyes fixed, and his mouth open, wondering\r\nwhere the cardinal was going. When he beheld him entering his own house,\r\nhe bustled his way through the crowd, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cMake room for those\r\nwho have a right to enter,\xe2\x80\x9d and followed into the house.\r\n\r\nAgnes and Lucy heard an increasing murmur in the street; and whilst they\r\nwere surmising the cause, the door opened, and, behold, the cardinal and\r\nthe curate!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the former of the curate, and at a sign in the\r\naffirmative he approached Lucy, who with her mother was standing,\r\nmotionless and mute with surprise and extreme diffidence: but the tones\r\nof the voice, the countenance, and above all, the words of Frederick,\r\nsoon removed their embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has\r\npermitted you to be subjected to a great trial; but he has also made you\r\nsee that he watches over you, and has never forgotten you. He has saved\r\nyou, and in addition to that blessing, has made use of you to accomplish\r\na great work through you, to impart the wonders of his grace and mercy\r\nto one man, and at the same time to comfort the hearts of many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the mistress of the house entered the room with her husband:\r\nperceiving their guests engaged in conversation, they respectfully\r\nretired to a distant part of the apartment. The cardinal bowed to them\r\ncourteously, and continued the conversation with Lucy and her mother. He\r\nmixed with the consolation he offered many enquiries, hoping to find\r\nfrom their answers some way of rendering them still farther services\r\nafter their sufferings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity all the clergy were not like your lordship, and then they\r\nwould take the part of the poor, and not help to bring them into\r\ndifficulty for the sake of drawing themselves out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes,\r\nencouraged by the familiar and affable manner of Frederick, and vexed\r\nthat Don Abbondio, after having sacrificed others to his own\r\nselfishness, should dare to forbid her making the least complaint to one\r\nso much above him, when by so fortunate a chance the occasion presented\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay all that you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cspeak freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say, that if our curate had done his duty, things would not\r\nhave been as they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal begging her to explain herself more clearly, she found\r\nsome embarrassment in relating a history, in which she had at one time\r\nplayed a part, which she felt very unwilling to communicate to such a\r\nman. However, she got over the difficulty; she related the projected\r\nmarriage, the refusal of Don Abbondio, and the pretext he had offered\r\nwith respect to his _superiors_ (oh, Agnes!); and passing to the attempt\r\nof Don Roderick, she told in what manner, being informed of it, they had\r\nbeen able to escape. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d added she in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cit was\r\nescaping to fall into another snare. If the curate had told us sincerely\r\nthe difficulty, and had married my poor children, we would have left the\r\ncountry immediately, and gone where no one would have known us, not even\r\nthe wind. Thus time was lost, and that which has happened, has\r\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curate shall render me an account of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord, no,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Agnes. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not speak on that account, do\r\nnot reprove him; because what is done, is done; and it would answer no\r\npurpose. He is a man of such a character, that if the thing were to do\r\nover again, he would act precisely in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Lucy, dissatisfied with this manner of telling the story, added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave also been to blame; it is plain that it was the will of God the\r\nthing should not succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you have been to blame, my poor child?\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick.\r\n\r\nLucy, notwithstanding the winks of her mother, related in her turn the\r\nhistory of the attempt made in the house of Don Abbondio, saying, as she\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9cWe did wrong, and God has punished us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept from his hand the chastisement you have endured, and take\r\ncourage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick; \xe2\x80\x9cfor who has a right to rejoice and hope, if\r\nnot those who have suffered, and who accuse themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then asked where was the betrothed; and learning from Agnes (Lucy\r\nstood silent with downcast eyes) the fact of his flight, he expressed\r\nastonishment and displeasure, and asked the reason of it. Agnes told\r\nwhat she knew of the story of Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of him before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how could a man,\r\nwho was engaged in affairs of this nature, be in treaty of marriage with\r\nthis young girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a worthy young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, blushing, but in a firm voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a peaceable youth, too peaceable, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d added Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nlordship may ask any one if he was not, even the curate. Who knows what\r\nintrigues and plots may have been going on at Milan? There needs little\r\nto make poor people pass for rogues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is but too true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cI will enquire about him,\r\nwithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a memorandum of the name of the young man,\r\nadding that he expected to be at their village in a few days; that\r\nduring his sojourn there, Lucy could return home without fear, and in\r\nthe mean while he would procure her an asylum till all was arranged for\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\nTurning to the master and mistress of the house, they came forward; he\r\nrenewed the thanks he had addressed to them by the mouth of the curate,\r\nand asked them if they would be willing to keep the guests God had sent\r\nthem for a few days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the dame, with a manner which said more than\r\nthis timid reply; but her husband, quite animated by the presence of\r\nsuch a man, by the desire to do himself honour on an occasion of such\r\nimportance, studied to make a fine answer. He wrinkled his forehead,\r\nstrained his eyes, and compressed his mouth, but nevertheless felt a\r\nconfusion of ideas, which prevented him from uttering a syllable. But\r\ntime pressed; the cardinal appeared to have interpreted his silence. The\r\npoor man opened his mouth, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cImagine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Not a word more could\r\nhe say. His failure not only filled him with shame on that day, but ever\r\nafter, the unfortunate recollection intruded itself to mar the pleasure\r\nof the great honour he had received. How many times, in thinking of this\r\ncircumstance, did a crowd of words come to his mind, every one of which\r\nwould have been better than \xe2\x80\x9c_Imagine!_\xe2\x80\x9d But the cavities of our brains\r\nare full enough of thoughts when it is too late to employ them.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal departed, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay the blessing of Heaven rest on this\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening he asked the curate in what way it would be best to\r\nindemnify the tailor, who could not be rich, for his hospitality. The\r\ncurate replied, that truly neither the profits of his trade, nor his\r\nincome from some little fields that the good tailor possessed, would at\r\nthis time have enabled him to be liberal to others; but from having\r\nsaved something the few years previous, he was one of the most easy in\r\ncircumstances in the district; that he could allow himself to exercise\r\nsome hospitality without inconvenience, and that he would do it with\r\npleasure; and that he was confident he would be hurt if money was\r\noffered to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has probably,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9csome demands on people who are\r\nunable to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may judge, my lord; the poor people pay with the overplus of the\r\nharvest; this year there has been no overplus; on the contrary, every\r\none is behind in point even of necessities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I take upon myself all these debts. You will do me the favour to\r\nobtain from him the memoranda, and cancel them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a very large sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. And perhaps you have but too many who are more\r\nmiserable, having no debts, because they have no credit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! indeed too many! they do what they can; but how can they supply\r\ntheir wants in these hard times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave them clothed at my expense; it is true that it seems to be robbery\r\nto spend any thing this year, except for bread; but this is a particular\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe cannot finish our record of the history of this day without briefly\r\nrelating the conduct of the Unknown. Before his second return to the\r\ncastle, the report of his conversion had preceded him; it had spread\r\nthrough the valley, and excited surprise, anxiety, and numerous\r\nconjectures. As he approached the castle he made a sign to all the\r\n_bravoes_ he met to follow him: filled with unusual apprehension, but\r\nwith their accustomed submission, they obeyed; their number increased\r\nevery moment. Reaching the castle, he entered the first court, and\r\nthere, resting on his saddle bow, in a voice of thunder he gave a loud\r\ncall, the wonted signal which all habitually obeyed. In a moment those\r\nwho were scattered about the castle hastened to join the troop collected\r\naround their leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and wait for me in the great hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; as they departed, he\r\ndismounted from his beast, and leading it himself to the stable, thence\r\napproached the hall. The whispering which was heard among them ceased at\r\nhis appearance; retiring to one corner they left a large space around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown raised his hand to enforce the silence that his presence\r\nalone had already effected; then raising his head, which yet was above\r\nthat of any of his followers, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, all of you; and\r\nlet no one speak, unless I ask him a question. My friends, the way which\r\nwe have followed until to-day leads to hell. I do not wish to reproach\r\nyou, I could not effect the important change, inasmuch as I have been\r\nyour leader in our abominable career; I have been the most guilty of\r\nall; but listen to what I am about to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod in his mercy has called me to a change of life, and I have obeyed\r\nhis call. May this same God do as much for you! Know, then, and hold for\r\ncertain, that I would rather now die than undertake any thing against\r\nhis holy law. I recall all the iniquitous orders which I may have given\r\nany one of you; you understand me. And farther, I order you to do\r\nnothing which I have hitherto prescribed to you. Hold equally for\r\ncertain, that no one can hereafter commit evil under my protection, and\r\nin my service. Those who will remain with me on these conditions, I\r\nshall regard as children. I should be happy, in the day of famine, to\r\nshare with them the last mouthful that remained to me. To those who do\r\nnot wish to continue here, shall be paid what is due of their salaries,\r\nand a further donative; they have liberty to depart, but they must never\r\nreturn, unless they repent and intend to lead a new life, and under such\r\ncircumstances they shall be received with open arms. Think of it this\r\nnight; to-morrow morning I will receive your answer, and then I will\r\ngive you your orders. Now, every one to his post. May God, who has\r\nshown compassion towards me, incline your hearts to repentance and good\r\ndispositions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and all kept silence. Although strange and tumultuous\r\nthoughts fermented in their minds, no indication of them was visible.\r\nThey had been habituated to listen to the voice of their lord, as to a\r\nmanifestation of absolute authority, to which it was necessary to yield\r\nimplicit obedience. His will proclaimed itself changed, but not\r\nenfeebled: it did not therefore enter their minds, that because he was\r\nconverted they might become bold in his presence, or reply to him as\r\nthey would to another man. They regarded him as a saint, indeed, but a\r\nsaint sword in hand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fear with which he inspired them, they felt for him\r\n(especially those who were born in his service, and these were the\r\ngreater number) the affection of vassals. Their admiration partook of\r\nthe nature of love, mingled with that respect which the most rebellious\r\nand turbulent spirits feel for a superior, whom they have voluntarily\r\nrecognised as such. The sentiments he expressed were certainly hateful\r\nto their ears, but they knew they were not false, neither were they\r\nentirely strange to them. If their custom had been to make them subjects\r\nof pleasantry, it was not from disbelief of their verity, but to drive\r\naway, by jesting, the apprehensions the contemplation of them might\r\notherwise have excited. And now, there was none among them who did not\r\nfeel some compunction at beholding their power exerted over the\r\ninvincible courage of their master. Moreover, some of them had heard the\r\nextraordinary intelligence beyond the valley, and had witnessed and\r\nrelated the joy of the people, the new feeling with which the Unknown\r\nwas regarded by them, the veneration which had succeeded their former\r\nhatred\xe2\x80\x94their former terror. They beheld the man whom they had never\r\nregarded without trembling, even when they themselves constituted, to a\r\ngreat degree, his strength; they beheld him now, the wonder, the idol of\r\nthe multitude,\xe2\x80\x94still elevated above all others, in a different manner,\r\nno doubt, but in one not less imposing,\xe2\x80\x94always above the world, always\r\nthe first. They were confounded, and each was doubtful of the course he\r\nshould pursue. One reflected hastily where he could find an asylum and\r\nemployment; another questioned with himself his power to accommodate\r\nhimself to the life of an honest man; another, moved by what he had\r\nsaid, felt some inclination for it; and another still was willing to\r\npromise any thing so as to be entitled to the share of a loaf, which had\r\nbeen so cordially proffered, and which was so scarce in those days. No\r\none, however, broke the silence. The Unknown, at the conclusion of his\r\nspeech, waved his hand imperiously for them to retire: obedient as a\r\nflock of sheep, they all quietly left the hall. He followed them, and\r\nstopping in the centre of the court, saw them all branch off to their\r\ndifferent stations. He returned into the castle, visited the corridors,\r\nhalls, and every avenue, and, finding all quiet, he retired to\r\nsleep,\xe2\x80\x94yes, to sleep, for he was very sleepy. In spite of all the\r\nurgent and intricate affairs in which he was involved, more than at any\r\nformer conjuncture, he was sleepy. Remorse had banished sleep the night\r\nbefore; its voice, so far from being subdued, was still more\r\nabsolute\xe2\x80\x94was louder\xe2\x80\x94yet he was sleepy. The order of his household so\r\nlong established, the absolute devotion of his faithful followers, his\r\npower and means of exercising it, its various ramifications, and the\r\nobjects on which it was employed, all tended to create uncertainty and\r\nconfusion in his mind,\xe2\x80\x94still he was sleepy.\r\n\r\nTo his bed then he went, that bed which the night before had been a bed\r\nof thorns; but first he knelt to pray. He sought, in the remotest corner\r\nof his memory, the words of prayer taught him in his days of childhood.\r\nThey came one by one: an age of vice had not effaced them. And who shall\r\ndefine the sentiments that pervaded his soul at this return to the\r\nhabits of happy innocence? He slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in the village of Lucy, and throughout all the\r\nterritory of Lecco, nothing was talked of but herself, the Unknown, the\r\narchbishop, and another person, who, although generally desirous to be\r\ntalked of, would willingly have been forgotten on this occasion,\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nmean Don Roderick.\r\n\r\nNot that, previous to this period, the villagers had not conversed much\r\nof his actions, in secret, to those in whom they had perfect confidence;\r\nbut now they could no longer contain themselves, nor surpress many\r\nenquiries on the marvellous events in which two persons so famous had\r\nplayed a part. In comparison of these two personages, Signor Don\r\nRoderick appeared rather insignificant, and all agreed in rejoicing over\r\nthe ill success of his iniquitous designs; but these rejoicings were\r\nstill, in some measure, moderated by fears of the _bravoes_ by whom he\r\nwas surrounded.\r\n\r\nA good portion of the public censure was bestowed on his friends and\r\ncourtiers. It did not spare the Signor _Podest\xc3\xa0_, always deaf and dumb\r\nand blind to the deeds of this tyrant, but these opinions were expressed\r\nin an under-tone, because the _Podest\xc3\xa0_ had his officers. Such regard\r\nwas not paid to Doctor _Azzecca Garbugli_, who had only his _tricks_ and\r\nhis _verbiage_ to employ for his defence; and as to the whole tribe of\r\nsycophants, resembling him, they were so pointed at, and eyed askance,\r\nthat for some time they thought it most prudent to keep themselves\r\nwithin doors.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick, struck, as by a thunderbolt, with the unexpected\r\nintelligence, so different from that which he had been anticipating from\r\nday to day, kept himself shut up in his castle, alone with his bravoes,\r\ndevouring his rage for the space of two days, and on the third set off\r\nfor Milan. If there had only existed the murmurs of the people,\r\nnotwithstanding things had gone so far, he would perhaps have remained\r\nexpressly to brave them; but he felt himself compelled to quit the field\r\nof contest, by the certain information that the cardinal was coming to\r\nthe village. The count, his uncle, who knew nothing of the story but\r\nwhat Attilio had told him, would certainly require him to be one of the\r\nfirst to visit the cardinal, in order to obtain in public the most\r\ndistinguished reception from him. The count would require it, because it\r\nwas an important opportunity for making known in what esteem the house\r\nwas held by his powerful eminence. To escape such a dilemma, Don\r\nRoderick, having risen before the sun, threw himself into a carriage\r\nwith Griso, and, followed by the rest of the _bravoes_, retired like a\r\nfugitive, like (if we may be permitted to elevate him by such a\r\ncomparison), like Catiline from Rome, foaming with rage, and threatening\r\na speedy return to accomplish his revenge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the cardinal approached, visiting every day one of the\r\nparishes situated in the territory of Lecco. On the day he was expected\r\nin the village, great preparations were made for his reception. At the\r\nentrance of the village, near the cottage of Agnes, a triumphal arch was\r\nerected, constructed of wood, covered with moss and straw, and\r\nornamented with green boughs of birch and holly. The front of the church\r\nwas adorned with tapestry; from every window of the houses were\r\nsuspended quilts and sheets, intended for drapery; every thing, in\r\nshort, whether in good taste or bad, was displayed in honour of this\r\nextraordinary occasion. At the hour of vespers (which was the hour\r\nFrederick usually selected to arrive at the churches which he visited),\r\nthose who had not gone to church, the old men, women, and the youngest\r\nof the children, went forth, in procession, to meet their expected\r\nguest, headed by Don Abbondio. The poor curate was sad in the midst of\r\nthe public joy; the tumult bewildered him; the movement of so many\r\npeople, before and behind, disturbed him; and, moreover, he was\r\ntormented by the secret apprehension that the women had tattled, and\r\nthat he should be obliged to render an account of his conduct to the\r\ncardinal.\r\n\r\nFrederick appeared at last, or rather the crowd appeared, in the midst\r\nof which was his litter, and the retinue surrounding it. The persons who\r\nfollowed Don Abbondio scattered and mingled themselves with the crowd,\r\nnotwithstanding all his remonstrances; and he, poor man, finding himself\r\ndeserted by them, went to the church, there to await the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal advanced, bestowing benedictions with his hands, and\r\nreceiving them in return from the mouths of the people, who were with\r\ndifficulty kept back by his attendants. Being of the same village as\r\nLucy, these peasants were desirous of rendering to the archbishop\r\npeculiar demonstrations of respect, but this was not practicable,\r\ninasmuch as, wherever he went, he was received with every possible\r\nhonour. In the very commencement of his pontificate, at his first solemn\r\nentrance into the cathedral, the concourse had been so great that his\r\nlife was in peril. Some gentlemen, who were near him, drew their swords\r\nto keep back and alarm the crowd. Such was the rude violence of the\r\ntimes, that even in the general disposition to do honour to their\r\narchbishop, they were on the point of crushing him: and this defence\r\nwould not have been sufficient, if two priests, of great vigour and\r\npresence of mind, had not raised him in their arms, and carried him from\r\nthe church door to the foot of the great altar. His very first entrance\r\ninto the church, therefore, might be recorded amidst his pastoral\r\nlabours and the dangers he had run.\r\n\r\nEntering the church, the cardinal advanced to the altar, and after\r\nhaving prayed some time, he addressed, as was his custom, some words to\r\nthe people, on his love for them, on his desire for their salvation, and\r\nhow they should dispose their minds for the duties of the morrow. He\r\nthen withdrew to the house of the curate, and among other questions\r\nwhich he put to him, he interrogated him with regard to the character\r\nand conduct of Renzo. Don Abbondio replied that he was rather choleric\r\nand obstinate: but as the cardinal made more special and precise\r\nenquiries, he was obliged to confess that he was an honest peaceable\r\nyouth, and even he himself could not comprehend how he had committed at\r\nMilan the conduct which had been imputed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the young girl,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think she can\r\nreturn now with safety to her house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9cshe can come and remain for a\r\nwhile. I say, at present, but,\xe2\x80\x9d added he with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cyour illustrious\r\nlordship should be always near at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is always present,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will use my efforts\r\nto secure a place of safety for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing Don Abbondio, he ordered him to send a litter, on the\r\nfollowing day, for Lucy and her mother.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio went away quite pleased that the cardinal had talked to him\r\nof the young couple, without even alluding to his refusal to marry them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows nothing of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes has kept silence! wonderful!\r\nShe will see him again, \xe2\x80\x99tis true, but she shall have further\r\ninstructions from me, so she shall.\xe2\x80\x9d He little thought, poor man, that\r\nFrederick had only deferred the enquiry until he should have more\r\nleisure to learn the reasons of his conduct.\r\n\r\nBut the solicitude of the good prelate for the disposal of Lucy had been\r\nrendered useless, by a circumstance which we will relate.\r\n\r\nThe two females had as far as possible resumed, for the few days they\r\nhad to pass under the hospitable roof of the tailor, their usual manner\r\nof life. As she had done at the monastery, Lucy, in a small chamber\r\napart, employed herself in sewing; and Agnes, keeping much at home,\r\nremained for the most part with her daughter. Their conversations were\r\naffectionate and sorrowful; both were prepared for a separation, since\r\nthe sheep could not dwell in the neighbourhood of the wolf. But how long\r\nwas this separation to continue? The future was dark and inexplicable,\r\nbut Agnes, notwithstanding, was full of agreeable anticipation. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cif no irreparable misfortune has befallen Renzo, we\r\nshall soon hear from him. If he has found employment, (and who can doubt\r\nit?) and if he keeps the faith he has sworn to you, why cannot we go and\r\nlive with him?\xe2\x80\x9d Her daughter felt as much sorrow in listening to her\r\nhopes, as difficulty in replying to them. She still kept her secret in\r\nher heart; and although troubled at the idea of concealment with so good\r\na mother, she was nevertheless restrained by a thousand fears from\r\ncommunicating it. Her plans were, indeed, very different from those of\r\nher mother, or rather, she had none, having committed the future into\r\nthe hands of Providence; she therefore endeavoured to change the\r\nsubject, saying in general terms that her only hope was to be\r\npermanently re-united to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why you feel thus?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have suffered so much,\r\nthat it seems impossible to you that things can turn out happily. But\r\nlet God work; and if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Let a ray of hope come\xe2\x80\x94a single ray, and then\r\nwe shall see that you will think differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy and her mother entertained a lively friendship for their kind\r\nhosts, which was warmly reciprocated; and between whom can friendship\r\nexist more in its purity, than between the benefactor and the recipients\r\nof the benefit, when both have kind hearts! Agnes, especially, had long\r\ngossips with the mistress of the house, and the tailor afforded them\r\nmuch amusement by his tales and moral discourses; at dinner particularly\r\nhe had always something to relate of the sword of Roland, or of the\r\nFathers of the Thebaid.\r\n\r\nAt some miles\xe2\x80\x99 distance from the village there dwelt a certain Don\r\nFerrante, and Donna Prassede his wife; the latter was a woman of high\r\nbirth, somewhat advanced in age, and exceedingly inclined to do good;\r\nwhich is surely the most praiseworthy employment one can be engaged on\r\nin this world; but which, indulged in without judgment, may be rendered\r\nhurtful, like all other good things. To do good, we must have correct\r\nideas of good in itself considered, and this can be acquired only by\r\ncontrol over our own hearts. Donna Prassede governed herself with her\r\nideas, as some do with their friends; she had very few, but to these she\r\nwas much attached. Among these few, were a number unfortunately a little\r\nnarrow and unreasonable, and they were not those she loved the least.\r\nThence it happened that she regarded things as good, which were not\r\nreally so, and that she used means which were calculated to promote the\r\nvery opposite of that which she intended; to this perversion of her\r\nintellect may also be attributed the fact, that she esteemed all\r\nmeasures to be lawful to her who was bent on the performance of duty. In\r\nshort, with good intentions, her moral perceptions were in no small\r\ndegree distorted. Hearing the wonderful story of Lucy, she was seized\r\nwith a desire to know her, and immediately sent her carriage for the\r\nmother and daughter. Lucy, having no desire to go, requested the tailor\r\nto find some excuse for her; if they had been _common people_, who\r\ndesired to make her acquaintance, the tailor would willingly have\r\nrendered her the service, but, under such circumstances, refusal\r\nappeared to him a species of insult. He uttered so many exclamations,\r\nsuch as, that it was not customary\xe2\x80\x94that it was a high family\xe2\x80\x94that it\r\nwas out of the question to say _No_ to such people\xe2\x80\x94that it might make\r\ntheir fortune\xe2\x80\x94and that, in addition to all this, Donna Prassede was a\r\nsaint,\xe2\x80\x94that Lucy was finally obliged to yield, especially as Agnes\r\nseconded the remonstrances and arguments of the tailor.\r\n\r\nThe high-born dame received them with many congratulations; she\r\nquestioned and advised them with an air of conscious superiority, which\r\nwas, however, tempered by so many soft and humble expressions, and\r\nmingled with so much zeal and devotion, that Agnes and Lucy soon felt\r\nthemselves relieved from the painful restraint her mere presence had at\r\nfirst imposed on them. In brief, Donna Prassede, learning that the\r\ncardinal wished to procure an asylum for Lucy, and impelled by the\r\ndesire to second, and at the same time to anticipate, his good\r\nintention, offered to take the young girl to her house, where there\r\nwould be no other service required of her than to direct the labours of\r\nthe needle or the spindle. She added, that she herself would inform the\r\ncardinal of the arrangement.\r\n\r\nBesides the obvious and ordinary benefit conferred by her invitation,\r\nDonna Prassede proposed to herself another, which she deemed to be\r\npeculiarly important; this was to school impatience, and to place in\r\nthe right path a young creature who had much need of guidance. The\r\nfirst time she heard Lucy spoken of, she was immediately persuaded that\r\nin one so young, who had betrothed herself to a robber, a criminal, a\r\nfugitive from justice such as Renzo, there must be some corruption,\r\nsome concealed vice. \xe2\x80\x9c_Tell me what company you keep, and I will tell\r\nyou who you are._\xe2\x80\x9d The visit of Lucy had confirmed her opinion; she\r\nappeared, indeed, to be an artless girl, but who could tell the cause\r\nof her downcast looks and timid replies? There was no great effort of\r\nmind necessary to perceive that the maiden had opinions of her own.\r\nHer blushes, sighs, and particularly her large and beautiful eyes, did\r\nnot please Donna Prassede at all. She regarded it as certain as if she\r\nhad been told it by one having authority, that the misfortunes of Lucy\r\nwere a punishment from Heaven for her connection with that villain,\r\nand a warning to withdraw herself from him entirely. That settled the\r\ndetermination to lend her co-operation to further so desirable a work;\r\nfor as she frequently said to herself and others, \xe2\x80\x9cWas it not her\r\nconstant study to second the will of Heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d But, alas! she often fell\r\ninto the terrible mistake of taking for the will of Heaven, the vain\r\nimaginings of her own brain. However, she was on the present occasion\r\nvery careful not to exhibit any of her proposed intentions. It was one\r\nof her maxims, that the first rule to be observed in accomplishing a\r\ngood design, is to keep your motives to yourself.\r\n\r\nExcepting the painful necessity of separation the offer appeared to both\r\nmother and daughter very inviting, were it only on account of the short\r\ndistance from the castle to their village. Reading in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance their mutual assent, they accepted with many thanks the\r\nkindness of Donna Prassede, who renewing her kind promises, said she\r\nwould soon send them a letter to present to the cardinal. The two\r\nfemales having departed, she requested Don Ferrante to write a letter,\r\nwho, being a literary and learned man, was employed as her secretary on\r\noccasions of importance. In an affair of this sort, Don Ferrante did his\r\nbest, and he gave the original to his wife in order that she could copy\r\nit; he warmly recommended to her an attention to the orthography, as\r\northography was among the great number of things he had studied, and\r\namong the small number over which he had control in his family. The\r\nletter was forthwith copied and sent to the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s house. These events\r\noccurred a few days before the cardinal had despatched a litter to bring\r\nthe mother and daughter to their abode.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival they went to the parsonage; orders having been left\r\nfor their immediate admittance to the presence of the cardinal. The\r\nchaplain, who conducted them thither, gave them many instructions with\r\nregard to the ceremony to be used with him, and the titles to be given\r\nhim; it was a continual torment to the poor man to behold the little\r\nceremony that reigned around the good archbishop in this respect. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nresults,\xe2\x80\x9d he was accustomed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the excessive goodness of this\r\nblessed man\xe2\x80\x94from his great familiarity.\xe2\x80\x9d And he added that he had \xe2\x80\x9ceven\r\nheard people address him with _Yes, sir_, and _No, sir_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the cardinal was conversing with Don Abbondio on the\r\naffairs of his parish; so that the latter had no opportunity to repeat\r\nhis instructions to the females; however, in passing by them as they\r\nentered, he gave them a glance, to make them comprehend that he was well\r\nsatisfied with them, and that they should continue, like honest and\r\nworthy women, to keep silence.\r\n\r\nAfter the first reception, Agnes drew from her bosom the letter of Donna\r\nPrassede, and gave it to the cardinal, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is from the Signora\r\nDonna Prassede, who says that she knows your illustrious lordship well,\r\nmy lord, as naturally is the case with great people. When you have read,\r\nyou will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, after having read the letter, and\r\nextracted its meaning from the trash of Don Ferrante\xe2\x80\x99s flowers of\r\nrhetoric. He knew the family well enough to be certain that Lucy had\r\nbeen invited into it with good intentions, and that she would be\r\nsheltered from the snares and violence of her persecutor. As to his\r\nopinion of Donna Prassede, we do not know it precisely; probably she was\r\nnot a person he would have chosen for Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s protectress; but it was not\r\nhis habit to undo things, apparently ordered by Providence, in order to\r\ndo them better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSubmit, without regret, to this separation also, and to the suspense in\r\nwhich you are left,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHope for the best, and confide in God!\r\nand be persuaded, that all that He sends you, whether of joy or sorrow,\r\nwill be for your permanent good.\xe2\x80\x9d Having received the benediction which\r\nhe bestowed on them, they took their leave.\r\n\r\nHardly had they reached the street, when they were surrounded by a swarm\r\nof friends, who were expecting them, and who conducted them in triumph\r\nto their house. Their female acquaintances congratulated them,\r\nsympathised with them, and overwhelmed them with enquiries. Learning\r\nthat Lucy was to depart on the following morning, they broke forth in\r\nexclamations of regret and disappointment. The men disputed with each\r\nother the privilege of offering their services; each wished to remain\r\nfor the night to guard their cottage, which reminds us of a proverb;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_If you would have people willing to confer favours on you, be sure not\r\nto need them._\xe2\x80\x9d This warmth of reception served a little to withdraw\r\nLucy from the painful recollections which crowded upon her mind, at the\r\nsight of her loved home.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the bell which announced the commencement of the\r\nceremonies, all moved towards the church. The ceremonies over, Don\r\nAbbondio, who had hastened home to see every thing arranged for\r\nbreakfast, was told that the cardinal wished to speak with him. He\r\nproceeded to the chamber of his illustrious guest, who accosted him as\r\nhe entered, with \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Curate, why did you not unite in marriage, Lucy\r\nto her betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have emptied the sack this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio, and he\r\nstammered forth, \xe2\x80\x9cYour illustrious lordship has no doubt heard of all\r\nthe difficulties of that business. It has been such an intricate affair,\r\nthat it cannot even now be seen into clearly. Your illustrious lordship\r\nknows that the young girl is here, only by a miracle; and that no one\r\ncan tell where the young man is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask if it is true, that, before these unhappy events, you refused to\r\ncelebrate the marriage on the day agreed upon? and why you did so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly\xe2\x80\x94if your illustrious lordship knew\xe2\x80\x94what terrible orders I\r\nreceived\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and he stopped, indicating by his manner, though\r\nrespectfully, that it would be imprudent in the cardinal to enquire\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, in a tone of much more gravity than he was\r\naccustomed to employ, \xe2\x80\x9cit is your bishop, who, from a sense of duty, and\r\nfor your own justification, would learn from you, why you have not done\r\nthat which, in the ordinary course of events, it was your strict duty to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not mean to say,\xe2\x80\x94but it appears to\r\nme, that as these things are now without remedy, it is useless to stir\r\nthem up\xe2\x80\x94However, however, I say, that I am sure your illustrious\r\nlordship would not betray a poor curate, because, you see, my lord, your\r\nillustrious lordship cannot be every where present, and I\xe2\x80\x94I remain\r\nhere, exposed\xe2\x80\x94However, if you order me, I will tell all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak; I ask for nothing but to find you free from blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio then related his melancholy story, suppressing the name of\r\nthe principal personage, and substituting in its place, \xe2\x80\x9c_a great\r\nlord_,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thus giving to prudence the little that was left him in such an\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had no other motive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal, after having heard\r\nhim through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I have not clearly explained myself. It was under pain of death\r\nthat they ordered me not to perform the ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this reason appeared sufficient to prevent the fulfilment of a\r\nrigorous duty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know my obligation is to do my duty, even to my greatest detriment;\r\nbut when life is at stake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you presented yourself to the church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick, with\r\nincreased severity of manner, \xe2\x80\x9cto be admitted to the holy ministry, were\r\nthere any such reservations made? Were you told that the duties imposed\r\nby the ministry were free from every obstacle, exempt from every peril?\r\nWere you told that personal safety was to be the guide and limit of your\r\nduty? Were you not told expressly the reverse of all this? Were you not\r\nwarned that you were sent as a lamb among wolves? Did you not even then\r\nknow that there were violent men in the world, who would oppose you in\r\nthe performance of your duty? He, whose example should be our guide, in\r\nimitation of whom we call ourselves shepherds, when he came on earth to\r\naccomplish the designs of his benevolence, did he pay regard to his own\r\nsafety? And if your object be to preserve your miserable existence, at\r\nthe expense of charity and duty, there was no necessity for your\r\nreceiving holy unction, and entering into the priesthood. The world\r\nimparts this virtue, teaches this doctrine. What do I say? O shame! the\r\nworld itself rejects it. It has likewise its laws, which prescribe good,\r\nand prohibit evil; it has also its gospel, a gospel of pride and hatred,\r\nwhich will not admit the love of life to be offered as a plea for the\r\ntransgression of its laws. It commands, and is obeyed; but we, we\r\nchildren and messengers of the promise! what would become of the church,\r\nif your language was held by all your brethren? Where would she now be,\r\nif she had originally come forth with such doctrines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio hung down his head; he felt under the weight of these\r\narguments as a chicken under the talons of a hawk, who holds him\r\nsuspended in an unknown region, in an atmosphere he had never before\r\nbreathed. Seeing that a reply was necessary, he said, more alarmed than\r\nconvinced,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, I have done wrong; since we should pay no regard to life, I\r\nhave nothing more to say. But when one has to do with certain powerful\r\npeople, who will not listen to reason, I do not see what is to be gained\r\nby carrying things with a high hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd know you not that our gain is to suffer for the sake of justice? If\r\nyou are ignorant of this, what is it you preach? What do you teach? What\r\nis the _good news_ which you proclaim to the poor? Who has required this\r\nat your hand, to overcome force by force? Certainly you will not be\r\nasked at the day of judgment, if you have vanquished the powerful, for\r\nyou have neither had the commission nor the means to do so. But, you\r\n_will_ be asked, if you have employed the means which have been placed\r\nin your power, to do that which was prescribed to you, even when man had\r\nthe temerity to forbid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese saints are odd creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9cextract the\r\nessence of this discourse, and it will be found that he has more at\r\nheart the love of two young people, than the life of a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d He would\r\nhave been delighted to have had the conversation terminate here, but he\r\nwell perceived that such was not the intention of the cardinal, who\r\nappeared to be waiting a reply, or apology, or something of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have done wrong\xe2\x80\x94We cannot give\r\nourselves courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why, then, I might say to you, have you undertaken a ministry which\r\nimposes on you the task of warring with the passions of the world? But,\r\nI will rather say, how is it that you have forgotten, that where courage\r\nis necessary to fulfil the obligations of this holy vocation, the Most\r\nHigh would assuredly impart it to you, were you earnestly to implore it?\r\nDo you think the millions of martyrs had courage naturally? that they\r\nhad naturally a contempt for life, young Christians who had just begun\r\nto taste its charms, children, mothers! All had courage, simply because\r\ncourage was necessary, and they trusted in God to impart it. Knowing\r\nyour own weakness, have you ever thought of preparing yourself for the\r\ndifficult situations in which you might be placed? Ah! if, during so\r\nmany years of pastoral care, you had loved your flock, (and how could\r\nyou refrain from loving them?) if you had reposed in them your\r\naffections, your dearest cares, your greatest delights, you would not\r\nhave failed in courage: love is intrepid; if you had loved those who\r\nwere committed to your spiritual guardianship, those whom you call\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94if you had really loved them, when you beheld two of them\r\nthreatened at the same time with yourself. Ah! certainly, charity would\r\nhave made you tremble for them, as the weakness of the flesh made you\r\ntremble for yourself. You would have humbled yourself before God for\r\nthe first risings of selfish terror; you would have considered it a\r\ntemptation, and have implored strength to resist it. But, you would have\r\neagerly listened to the holy and noble anxiety for the safety of others,\r\nfor the safety of your children; you would have been unable to find a\r\nmoment of repose; you would have been impelled, constrained to do all\r\nthat you could to avert the evil that threatened them. With what then\r\nhas this love, this anxiety, inspired you? What have you done for them?\r\nHow have you been engaged in their service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he paused for a reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio uttered not a word. It must be confessed that we ourselves,\r\nwho have nothing to fear but the criticisms of our readers, feel a\r\ndegree of repugnance in thus urging the unfashionable precepts of\r\ncharity, courage, indefatigable solicitude for others, and unlimited\r\nsacrifice of self. But the reflection that these things were said by a\r\nman who practised what he preached, encourages us to proceed in our\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not answer,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! if you had followed the\r\ndictates of charity and duty, whatever had been the result, you would\r\nnow have been at no loss for a reply. Behold, then, what you have done;\r\nyou having obeyed iniquity, regardless of the requirements of duty; you\r\nhave obeyed her promptly; she had only to show herself to you, and\r\nsignify her desire, and she found you ready at her call. But she would\r\nhave had recourse to artifice with one who was on his guard against her,\r\nshe would have avoided exciting his suspicion, she would have employed\r\nconcealment, that she might mature at leisure her projects of treachery\r\nand violence; she has, on the contrary, boldly ordered you to infringe\r\nyour duty, and keep silence; you have obeyed, you have infringed it,\r\nand you have kept silence. I ask you now, if you have done nothing more.\r\nTell me if it is true, that you have advanced false pretences for your\r\nrefusal, so as not to reveal the true motive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have told this also, the tattlers!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio, but as\r\nhe gave no indication of addressing himself to speech, the cardinal\r\npursued,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, that you told these young people falsehoods to\r\nkeep them in ignorance and darkness?\xe2\x80\x94I am compelled, then, to believe\r\nit; it only remains for me to blush for you, and to hope that you will\r\nweep with me. Behold where it has led you, (merciful God! and you\r\nadvanced it as a justification!) behold to what it has conducted you,\r\nthis solicitude for your life! It has led you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94(repel freely the\r\nassertion if it appear to you unjust: take it as a salutary humiliation\r\nif it is not) it has led you to deceive the feeble and unfortunate, to\r\nlie to your children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way of the world!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio again; \xe2\x80\x9cto this\r\ndevil incarnate,\xe2\x80\x9d (referring to the Unknown,) \xe2\x80\x9chis arms around his neck;\r\nand to me, for a half lie, reproaches without end! But you are our\r\nsuperiors; of course you are right. It is my star, that all the world is\r\nagainst me, not excepting the saints.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued aloud,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have done\r\nwrong! I see that I have done wrong. But what could I do in so\r\nembarrassing a situation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still ask? Have I not told you? And must I repeat it? You should\r\nhave loved, my son, you should have loved and prayed; you would then\r\nhave felt that iniquity might threaten, but not enforce obedience; you\r\nwould have united, according to the laws of God, those whom man desired\r\nto separate; you would have exercised the ministry these children had a\r\nright to expect from you. God would have been answerable for the\r\nconsequences, as you were obeying His orders; now, since you have obeyed\r\nman, the responsibility falls on yourself. And what consequences, just\r\nHeaven! And why did you not remember that you had a superior? How would\r\nhe now dare to reprimand you for having failed in your duty, if he did\r\nnot at all times feel himself obliged to aid you in its performance? Why\r\ndid you not inform your bishop of the obstacles which infamous power\r\nexerted to prevent the exercise of your ministry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the advice of Perpetua,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio vexed, to whose\r\nmind, even in the midst of these touching appeals, the images which most\r\nfrequently presented themselves, were those of the bravoes and Don\r\nRoderick, alive and well, and returning at some future time, triumphant,\r\nand inflamed with rage. Although the presence, the aspect, and the\r\nlanguage of the cardinal embarrassed him, and impressed him with a\r\ndegree of apprehension, it was, however, an embarrassment and an\r\napprehension which did not subjugate his thoughts, nor prevent him from\r\nreflecting that, after all, the cardinal employed neither arms nor\r\nbravoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not think,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if no other asylum was\r\nopen to these innocent victims, I could myself receive them, and place\r\nthem in safety, if you had sent them to me; sent them afflicted and\r\ndesolate to their bishop; as therefore belonging to him, as the most\r\nprecious part, I say not of his charge, but of his wealth! And as for\r\nyou, I should have been anxious for you; I would not have slept until\r\ncertain that not a hair of your head would be touched; and do you not\r\nsuppose that this man, however audacious he may be, would have lost\r\nsomething of his audacity, when convinced that his designs were known by\r\nme, that I watched over them, and that I was decided to employ for your\r\ndefence all the means within my power! Know you not, that if man\r\npromises too often more than he performs, he threatens also more than he\r\ndare execute? Know you not that iniquity does not depend solely on its\r\nown strength, but on the credulity and cowardice of others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the reasoning of Perpetua,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio, without\r\nconsidering that this singular coincidence in judgment of Frederick\r\nBorromeo and his servant, was an additional argument against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have only contemplated your own\r\ndanger. How is it possible that your personal safety can have appeared\r\nof importance enough to sacrifice every thing to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I saw them, I saw those frightful faces,\xe2\x80\x9d escaped from Don\r\nAbbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard those horrible words. Your illustrious worship talks\r\nwell, but you should have been in the place of your poor priest, and\r\nhave had the same thing happen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he uttered these words than he bit his tongue, perceiving\r\nthat he had suffered himself to be overcome by vexation; he muttered in\r\na low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cNow for the storm!\xe2\x80\x9d and raising his eyes timidly, he was\r\nastonished to see the cardinal, whom he never could comprehend, pass\r\nfrom the severe air of authority and rebuke, to that of a soft and\r\npensive gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but too true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frederick. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is our terrible and\r\nmiserable condition! We exact rigorously from others, that which it may\r\nbe we would not be willing to render ourselves; we judge, correct, and\r\nreprimand, and God alone knows what we would do in the same situation,\r\nwhat we _have_ done in similar situations. But, woe be to me, if I take\r\nmy weakness for the measure of another\xe2\x80\x99s duty, for the rule of my\r\ninstruction! Nevertheless it is certain, that while imparting precepts,\r\nI should also afford an example to my neighbour, and not resemble the\r\npharisee, who imposes on others enormous burthens, which he himself\r\nwould not so much as touch with his finger. Hear me then, my son, my\r\nbrother; the errors of those in authority, are oftener better known to\r\nothers than to themselves; if you know that I have, from cowardice, or\r\nrespect to the opinions of men, neglected any part of my duty, tell me\r\nof it frankly, so that where I have failed in example, I may at least\r\nnot be wanting in humble confession. Show me freely my weakness, and\r\nthen words from my mouth will be more available, because you will be\r\nconscious that they do not proceed from me, but that they are the words\r\nof Him who can give to us both the necessary strength to do what He\r\nprescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what a holy man, but what a troublesome one!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe censures himself, and wishes that I should examine, criticise, and\r\ncontrol even _his_ actions!\xe2\x80\x9d He continued aloud,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my lord jests,\r\nsurely! Who does not know the courage and indefatigable zeal of your\r\nillustrious lordship?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cby far too\r\nindefatigable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not desire praise that makes me tremble, because God knows my\r\nimperfections, and what I know of them myself is sufficient to humble\r\nme. But I would desire that we should humble ourselves together; I would\r\ndesire that you should feel what your conduct has been, and that your\r\nlanguage is opposed to the law you preach, and according to which you\r\nwill be judged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll turns against me. But these persons who have told your lordship\r\nthese things, have they not also told you that they introduced\r\nthemselves treacherously into my house, for the purpose of compelling me\r\nto perform the marriage ceremony, in a manner unauthorised by the\r\nchurch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _have_ told me, my son; but what afflicts and depresses me, is to\r\nsee you still seeking excuses; still excusing yourself by accusing\r\nothers; still accusing others of that which should have formed a part of\r\nyour own confession. Who placed these unfortunates, I do not say under\r\nthe necessity, but under the temptation, to do what they have? Would\r\nthey have sought this irregular method, if the legitimate way had not\r\nbeen closed to them? Would they have thought of laying snares for their\r\npastor, if they had been received, aided, and advised by him? of\r\nsurprising him, if he had not concealed himself? And you wish to make\r\nthem bear the blame; and you are indignant that, after so many\r\nmisfortunes, what do I say? in the very midst of misfortune, they have\r\nsuffered a word of complaint to escape before their pastor and yours?\r\nthat the complaints of the oppressed and the afflicted should be hateful\r\nto the world, is not astonishing; but to us! and what advantage would\r\ntheir silence have been to you? Would you have been the gainer from\r\ntheir cause having been committed entirely to the judgment of God? Is it\r\nnot an additional reason to love them, that they have afforded you the\r\noccasion to hear the sincere voice of your pastor; that they have\r\nprovided for you the means to understand more clearly, and quite as far\r\nas may be in your power, the great debt you have contracted to them? Ah!\r\nif they had even been the aggressors, I would tell you to love them for\r\nthat very reason. Love them, because they have suffered, and do suffer;\r\nlove them, because they are a part of your flock, because you yourself\r\nhave need of pardon and of their prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio kept silence, but no longer from vexation, and an\r\nunwillingness to be persuaded; he kept silence from having more things\r\nto think of than to say. The words which he heard were unexpected\r\nconclusions, a new application of familiar doctrine. The evil done to\r\nhis neighbour, which apprehension on his own account had hitherto\r\nprevented him from beholding in its true light, now made a novel and\r\nstriking impression on his mind. If he did not feel all the remorse\r\nwhich the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances were calculated to produce, he\r\nexperienced at least secret dissatisfaction with himself and pity for\r\nothers; a blending of tenderness and shame; as, if we may be permitted\r\nto use the comparison, a humid and crushed taper at first hisses and\r\nsmokes, but by degrees receives warmth, and imparts light, from the\r\nflame of a great torch to which it is presented. Don Abbondio would have\r\nloudly accused himself, and deplored his conduct, had not the idea of\r\nDon Roderick still obtruded itself into his thoughts; however, his\r\nfeeling was sufficiently apparent to convince the cardinal that his\r\nwords had at last produced some effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cone of these unfortunate beings is a fugitive\r\nafar off, the other on the point of departure; both have but too much\r\nreason to keep asunder, without any present probability of being\r\nre-united. Now, alas! they have no need of you; now, alas! you have no\r\nlonger the opportunity to do them good, and our short foresight can\r\nassure us of but little of the future. But who knows, if God in his\r\ncompassion is not preparing the occasion for you? Ah! do not let it\r\nescape; seek it, watch for it, implore it as a blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not fail, my lord\xe2\x80\x94I shall not fail to do so, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Don Abbondio, in a tone that came from the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, my son, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frederick with affectionate dignity;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows that I would have desired to hold other converse with you.\r\nWe have both had a long pilgrimage through life. Heaven knows how\r\npainful it has been to me, to grieve your old age by reproaches; how\r\nmuch more I should have loved to occupy the time of this interview in\r\nmutual consolation, and mutual anticipation of the heavenly hope which\r\nis so near our grasp! God grant that the language I have been obliged to\r\nhold may be useful to both of us! Act in such a manner, that He will not\r\ncall me to account on the great and terrible day, for having retained\r\nyou in a ministry of which you were unworthy. Let us redeem the time;\r\nthe night is far spent; the spouse will not linger; let us keep our\r\nlamps trimmed and burning. Let us offer to God our poor and miserable\r\nhearts, that he may fill them with his love!\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he arose to\r\ndepart; Don Abbondio followed him.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to Donna Prassede, who came, according to agreement,\r\non the following morning, for Lucy, and also to pay her duty to the\r\ncardinal. Frederick bestowed many praises on Lucy, and recommended her\r\nwarmly to the kindness of Donna Prassede; Lucy separated herself from\r\nher mother with many tears, and again bade farewell to her cottage and\r\nher village. But she was cheered by the hope of seeing her mother once\r\nmore before their final departure, as Donna Prassede informed them that\r\nit was her intention to remain for a few days at her villa, and Agnes\r\npromised to visit it again to take a last farewell.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was on the point of setting out for another parish, when\r\nthe curate of the village near which the castle of the Unknown was\r\nsituated, demanded permission to see him. He presented a small packet,\r\nand a letter from that lord, in which Frederick was requested to present\r\nto Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s mother a hundred crowns of gold, to serve as a dowry for the\r\nmaiden, or for any other purpose she might desire. The Unknown also\r\nrequested him to tell them, that if ever they should be in need of his\r\nservices, the poor girl knew but too well the place of his abode, and as\r\nfor him, he should consider it a high privilege to afford her\r\nprotection and assistance. The cardinal sent immediately for Agnes, and\r\ninformed her of the commission he had received. She heard it with equal\r\nsurprise and joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod reward this signor!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cyour illustrious lordship will\r\nthank him in our name, but do not say a word of the matter to any one,\r\nbecause we live in a world\xe2\x80\x94you will excuse me, I know a man like your\r\nlordship does not tattle about such things, but\xe2\x80\x94you understand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReturning to her house, she shut herself up in her chamber, and untied\r\nthe packet; although she was prepared for the sight, she was filled with\r\nwonder at seeing in her own power and in one heap such a quantity of\r\nthose coins which she had rarely ever seen before, and never more than\r\none at a time. She counted them over and over again, and wrapping them\r\ncarefully in a leather covering, concealed them under one corner of her\r\nbed. The rest of the day was employed in reverie and projects for the\r\nfuture, and desires for the arrival of the morrow; the night was passed\r\nin restless dreams, and vain imaginings of the blessings to be produced\r\nby this gold; at break of day, she arose, and departed for the villa of\r\nDonna Prassede.\r\n\r\nThe repugnance Lucy had felt to mention her vow, had not all diminished,\r\nbut she resolved to overcome it, and to disclose the circumstance to her\r\nmother in this conversation, which would probably be the last they\r\nshould have for a long time.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they left alone, than Agnes, with an animated\r\ncountenance, but in a low voice, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have great news to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand she related her unexpected good fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless this signor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have now enough to live\r\ncomfortably yourself, and also to benefit others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, we can do a great deal with this money! Listen, I have only\r\nyou, that is, I have only you two in the world, for from the moment that\r\nRenzo first addressed you, I have considered him as my son. We will hope\r\nthat no misfortune has befallen him, and that we shall soon hear from\r\nhim. As for myself, I would have wished to lay my bones in my own\r\ncountry, but now that you cannot stay here on account of this villain,\r\n(oh! even to think that he was near me, would make me dislike any\r\nplace!) I am quite willing to go away. I would have gone with you to the\r\nend of the earth before this good fortune, but how could we do it\r\nwithout money? The poor youth had indeed saved a few pence, of which the\r\nlaw deprived him, but in recompence God has sent us a fortune. So then,\r\nwhen he has informed us that he is living, and where he is, and what are\r\nhis intentions, I will go to Milan for you\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will go for you.\r\nFormerly I would not have dreamt of such a thing, but misfortune gives\r\ncourage and experience. I have been to Monza, and I know what it is to\r\ntravel. I will take with me a man of resolution; for instance, Alessio\r\ndi Maggianico; I will pay the expense, and\xe2\x80\x94do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut perceiving that Lucy, instead of exhibiting sympathy with her plans,\r\ncould with difficulty conceal her agitation and distress, she stopped in\r\nthe midst of her harangue, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? are you not\r\nof my opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy, throwing her arms around her neck, and\r\nconcealing on her bosom her face, bathed in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have told you sooner, but I had not the heart to do it. Have\r\npity on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut speak, speak then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot be the wife of that unfortunate youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy, with downcast looks and flowing tears, confessed at last the vow\r\nwhich she had made. She clasped her hands, and asked pardon of her\r\nmother for having concealed it from her, conjuring her to speak of it to\r\nno one, and to lend her aid to enable her to fulfil it.\r\n\r\nAgnes was overwhelmed with consternation; she would have been angry with\r\nher daughter for so long maintaining silence towards her, had not the\r\ngrave thoughts that the circumstance itself excited, stifled all feeling\r\nof resentment. She would have blamed her for her vow, had it not\r\nappeared to her to be contending against Heaven; for Lucy described to\r\nher again, in more lively colours than before, that horrible night, her\r\nutter desolation, and unexpected preservation! Agnes listened\r\nattentively; and a hundred examples that she had often heard related,\r\nthat she _herself_ even had related to her daughter, of strange and\r\nhorrible punishments for violated vows, came to her memory. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\r\nwilt thou do now?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is with the Lord that care rests; the Lord and the holy Virgin. I\r\nhave placed myself in their hands; they have never yet abandoned me,\r\nthey will not abandon me now that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94The favour I ask of God, the only\r\nfavour, after the safety of my soul, is to be restored to you, my\r\nbeloved mother! He will grant it, yes, he will grant it. That fatal\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94in the carriage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Oh! most holy Virgin! Those men\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94who would\r\nhave thought I should be the next day with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not tell your mother at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, I had not the heart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94What use was there in afflicting you\r\nsooner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Renzo?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy, starting, \xe2\x80\x9cI must think no more of the poor youth. God\r\nhas not intended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94You see it appears to be his will that we should\r\nseparate. And who knows?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But no, no; the Lord will preserve him from\r\nevery danger, and render him, perhaps, happier without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, nevertheless, if you had not bound yourself for ever, provided no\r\nmisfortune has happened to Renzo, with this money, I would have found a\r\nremedy for all our other evils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my mother, would this money have been ours if I had not passed\r\nthat terrible night? It is God\xe2\x80\x99s will that all should be thus; his will\r\nbe done!\xe2\x80\x9d And her voice became inarticulate through tears.\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected argument, Agnes maintained a mournful silence. After\r\nsome moments, Lucy, suppressing her sobs, resumed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow that the thing\r\nis done, we must submit cheerfully; and you, dear mother, you can aid\r\nme, first in praying to the Lord for your poor daughter, and then it is\r\nnecessary that Renzo should know it. When you ascertain where he is,\r\nhave him written to, find a man,\xe2\x80\x94your cousin Alessio, for instance, who\r\nis prudent and kind, who has always wished us well, and who will not\r\ntattle. Make Alessio write to him, and inform him of the circumstance as\r\nit occurred, where I was, and how I suffered; tell him that God has\r\nordered it thus, and that he must set his heart at rest; that, as for\r\nme, I can never be united to any one. Make him understand the matter\r\nclearly; when he knows that I have promised the Virgin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94he always has\r\nbeen pious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94And you, as soon as you hear from him, get some one to\r\nwrite to me, let me know that he is safe and well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and, nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgnes, with much emotion, assured her daughter that all should be done\r\nas she desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say something more; that which has befallen the poor youth,\r\nwould never have occurred to him, if he had never thought of me. He is a\r\nwanderer, a fugitive; he has lost all his little savings; he has been\r\ndeprived of every thing he possessed, poor fellow! and you know why\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwe, we have so much money! Oh! mother, since the Lord has sent us\r\nwealth, and since the unfortunate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94you regard him as your son, do you\r\nnot? Ah! divide it, share it with him! Endeavour to find a safe man, and\r\nsend him the half of it. God knows how much he may need it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just what I was thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Agnes. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will do it\r\ncertainly. Poor youth! And why did you think I was so pleased with the\r\nmoney, if it were not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94I came here well pleased,\xe2\x80\x99tis true; but,\r\nsince matters are so, I will send it to him. Poor youth! he also\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow what I mean. Certainly money gives pleasure to those who have need\r\nof it; but this money\xe2\x80\x94Ah! it is not this that will make him prosper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy returned thanks to her mother for her prompt and liberal accordance\r\nwith her request, so fervently, that an observer would have imagined her\r\nheart to be still devoted to Renzo, more than she herself was aware of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd without thee, what shall I do\xe2\x80\x94I, thy poor mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes,\r\nweeping in her turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, without you, my dear mother? and in a house of strangers, at\r\nMilan? But the Lord will be with us both, and will re-unite us. In eight\r\nor nine months we shall see each other again; let us leave it to him. I\r\nwill incessantly implore this favour from the Virgin; if I had any thing\r\nmore to offer her, I would not hesitate; but she is so compassionate,\r\nshe will surely grant my prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter parted with many tears, promising to see each\r\nother again, the coming autumn, at the latest, as if it depended on\r\nthemselves!\r\n\r\nA long time elapsed before Agnes heard any thing of Renzo; neither\r\nmessage nor letter was received from him; the people of the village were\r\nas ignorant concerning him as herself.\r\n\r\nShe was not the only one whose enquiries had been fruitless; it was not\r\na mere ceremony in the cardinal Frederick, when he promised Lucy and\r\nAgnes, to inform himself of the history and fate of Renzo; he fulfilled\r\nthat promise, by writing immediately to Bergamo for the purpose. While\r\nat Milan, on his return from visiting his diocese, he received a reply,\r\nin which he was informed that little was known of the young man; that he\r\nhad made, it was true, a short sojourn in such a place, but that one\r\nmorning he had suddenly disappeared; that a relation of his, with whom\r\nhe had lived while there, knew not what had become of him; he thought\r\nthat he had probably enlisted for the Levant, or had passed into\r\nGermany, or, which was most likely, that he had perished in crossing the\r\nriver. It was added, however, that should any more definite intelligence\r\nbe received concerning him, his illustrious lordship should immediately\r\nbe informed of it.\r\n\r\nThese reports eventually travelled to Lecco, and reached the ears of\r\nAgnes. The poor woman did her best to ascertain the truth of them; but\r\nshe was kept in a state of suspense and anxiety by the contradictory\r\naccounts which were given, and which were, in fact, all without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Milan, lieutenant-general under Don Gonzalo Fernandez de\r\nCordova, had complained bitterly to the lord resident of Venice at\r\nMilan, that a robber, a villain, an instigator of pillage and massacre,\r\nthe famous Lorenzo Tramaglino, had been received in the Bergamascan\r\nterritory. The resident replied, that he knew nothing of the matter, but\r\nthat he would write to Venice for information concerning it, in order to\r\ngive some explanation to his Excellency.\r\n\r\nIt was a maxim at Venice to encourage the tendency of the Milanese\r\nworkmen in silk, to establish themselves in the Bergamascan territory,\r\nby making them find it to their advantage to do so. For this reason,\r\nBortolo was warned confidentially, that Renzo was not safe in his\r\npresent residence, and that he would do wisely to place him in some\r\nother manufactory, and even cause him to change his name for a while.\r\nBortolo, who was quick of apprehension, made no objections, related the\r\nmatter to his cousin, and taking him to another place fifteen miles off,\r\nhe presented him, under the name of _Antonio Rivolta_, to the master of\r\nthe manufactory, who was a native of Milan, and moreover his old\r\nacquaintance. He, although the times were hard, did not require much\r\nentreaty to induce him to receive a workman so warmly recommended by an\r\nold friend. He saw reason afterwards to congratulate himself on the\r\nacquisition, although, at first, the young man appeared rather heedless,\r\nbecause, when they called _Antonio_, he scarcely ever answered.\r\n\r\nA short time after, an order arrived from Venice to the captain of\r\nBergamo, to inform himself, and send word to government, whether there\r\nwas not within his jurisdiction, and particularly in such a village,\r\nsuch an individual. The captain having obeyed in the best manner he\r\ncould, transmitted a reply in the negative, which was transmitted to the\r\nresident at Milan, in order that he should transmit it to Don Gonzalo\r\nFernandez de Cordova.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting inquisitive people, who enquired of Bortolo why\r\nthe young man had left him. The first time the question was put to him,\r\nhe simply replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d To relieve himself, however,\r\nfrom the most persevering, he framed the stories we have already\r\nrelated, at the same time offering them as mere reports that he had\r\nheard; without, however, placing much reliance on them.\r\n\r\nBut when enquiry came to be made by order of the cardinal, or rather, by\r\norder of some great person, as his name was not mentioned, Bortolo\r\nbecame more uneasy, and judged it prudent to maintain his ordinary\r\nmethod of reply, with this addition, that he gave to the stories he had\r\nfabricated an air of greater verity and plausibility.\r\n\r\nWe must not conclude, however, that Don Gonzalo had any personal dislike\r\nto our poor mountaineer; we must not conclude that, informed perhaps of\r\nhis disrespect and ill-timed jests upon his _Moorish king enchained by\r\nthe throat_, he wished to wreak his vengeance on him, nor that he\r\nconsidered him a person dangerous enough to be pursued even in his\r\nflight, as was Hannibal by the Roman senate. Don Gonzalo had too many\r\nthings to think of, to trouble himself with the actions of Renzo, and if\r\nhe appeared to do so, it was the result of a singular concurrence of\r\ncircumstances; by which the poor fellow, without wishing it, or even\r\nknowing why, found himself attached, as by an invisible thread, to\r\nnumerous and important affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion to mention more than once a war which was then\r\nfermenting, for the succession to the states of the Duke Vincenzo\r\nGonzaga, the second of the name; we have said that, at the death of this\r\nduke, his nearest heir, Carlos Gonzaga, chief of a younger branch\r\ntransplanted to France, where he possessed the duchies of Nevers and\r\nRhetel, had entered into possession of Mantua and Montferrat; the\r\nSpanish minister, who wished, at any price, to exclude from these two\r\nfiefs the new prince, and wanted some pretence to advance for his\r\nexclusion, had declared his intention to support the claims upon Mantua\r\nof another Gonzaga, Ferrante, Prince of Guastalla; and those upon\r\nMontferrat of Carlos Emanuel the First, Duke of Savoy, and Margherita\r\nGonzaga, Duchess dowager of Lorraine. Don Gonzalo, who was descended\r\nfrom the great captain whose name he bore, had already made war in\r\nFlanders; and as he was desirous beyond measure to direct one in Italy,\r\nhe made the greatest efforts to promote it. By interpreting the\r\nintentions, and by going beyond the orders of the minister, he had, in\r\nthe mean time, concluded with the Duke of Savoy a treaty for the\r\ninvasion and division of Montferrat; and easily obtained the\r\nratification of it, by the count duke, by persuading him that the\r\nacquisition of Casale, which was the point the best defended, of the\r\nportion granted to the King of Spain, was extremely easy. However, he\r\nstill continued to protest, in the name of his sovereign, that he\r\ndesired to occupy the country only as a trust, until the decision of the\r\nemperor should be declared. But in the meantime the emperor, influenced\r\nby others as well as by motives of his own, had refused the investiture\r\nto the new duke, and ordered him to leave in sequestration, the states\r\nwhich had been the subject of contention; promising, after he should\r\nhave heard both parties, to give it to the one whom he should deem\r\njustly entitled to it. The Duke of Nevers would not submit to these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe duke had high and powerful friends, being supported by the Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, the senate of Venice, and the pope. But the first of these,\r\nabsorbed at the time by the siege of Rochelle, embarrassed in a war with\r\nEngland, thwarted by the party of the queen mother, Mary de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici,\r\nwho, for particular reasons, was hostile to the house of Nevers, could\r\nonly hold out hopes and promises. The Venetians would not stir in the\r\ncontest, until a French army arrived in Italy; and while secretly aiding\r\nthe duke, they confined themselves, in their negotiations with the court\r\nof Madrid, and the government of Milan, to protests, offers, or even\r\nthreats, according to circumstances. Urban VIII. recommended the Duke\r\nof Nevers to his friends, interceded for him with his adversaries, and\r\nmade propositions of peace; but he never afforded him any military aid.\r\n\r\nThe two powers, allied for offensive operations, could then securely\r\nbegin their enterprise; Carlos Emanuel entered Montferrat, and Don\r\nGonzalo gladly undertook the siege of Casale; but he did not meet with\r\nthe success he had anticipated. The court did not afford him all the\r\nsupplies he demanded; his ally, on the contrary, was too liberal in his\r\naid to the cause; for, after having taken his own portion, he also took\r\nthat which had been assigned to the King of Spain. Don Gonzalo,\r\ninexpressibly enraged, but fearing, if he made the least complaint, that\r\nCarlos, as active in intrigue, and as brave in arms, as he was fickle in\r\ndisposition, and false to his promises, would throw himself on the side\r\nof France; was constrained to shut his eyes, to champ the bit, and to\r\nmaintain a satisfied appearance. Whether from the firm resistance of the\r\nbesieged, or from the small number of troops employed against them, or,\r\naccording to some statements, from the numerous mistakes of Don Gonzalo,\r\nthe siege, although protracted, was finally unsuccessful. It was at this\r\nvery period that the sedition of Milan obliged Don Gonzalo to go thither\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nIn the relation that was there made to him, the flight of Renzo was\r\nmentioned, and the facts, real or supposed, which had caused his arrest;\r\nhe was also informed that this man had taken refuge in the territory of\r\nBergamo. This latter circumstance attracted the attention of Don\r\nGonzalo; he knew that the Venetians had taken an interest in the\r\ninsurrection of Milan, and that, in the beginning of it, they had\r\nimagined that, on that account alone, he would be obliged to raise the\r\nsiege of Casale, and thus incur a heavy disappointment to his hopes. In\r\naddition to this, immediately after this event, the news was received,\r\nso much desired by the senate, and so much dreaded by Gonzalo, of the\r\nsurrender of Rochelle. Stung to the quick, as a man and a politician,\r\nand vexed at his loss of reputation, he sought out every occasion to\r\nconvince the Venetians, that he had lost none of his former boldness\r\nand determination; he therefore ventured to make loud complaints of the\r\nconduct of the senate. The resident of Venice, having come to pay his\r\nrespects to him, and endeavouring to read in his features and deportment\r\nwhat was passing in his mind, Don Gonzalo spoke lightly of the tumult,\r\nas a thing already quieted, making use, however, of the reception of\r\nRenzo, in the Bergamascan territory, as a pretext for complaint against\r\nthe Venetians. The result is known to our readers. When he had answered\r\nhis own purposes, with the affair, it was entirely forgotten by him.\r\n\r\nBut Renzo, who was far from suspecting the little importance that was in\r\nreality attached to him, had, for a long time, no other thought but to\r\nkeep himself concealed. It may well be supposed that he desired ardently\r\nto send intelligence to Lucy and her mother, and to hear from them in\r\nreturn. But to this, there were two very great obstacles. It was\r\nnecessary to confide in an amanuensis, as he himself was unable to\r\nwrite,\xe2\x80\x94an accomplishment in those days not very usual in his class; and\r\nhow could he venture to do this where all were strangers to him? The\r\nother difficulty was to find a trusty messenger, to take charge of the\r\nletter. He finally succeeded in overcoming these difficulties, and found\r\none of his companions who could write for him. But not knowing whether\r\nLucy and Agnes were still at Monza, he thought it best to enclose the\r\nletter under cover to Father Christopher, with a few lines in addition\r\nto him. The writer engaged to send it, and gave it to a man who was to\r\npass near Pescarenico, and who left it in an inn on the route, in a\r\nneighbouring place to the convent, and with many injunctions for its\r\nsafe delivery. As the cover was directed to a capuchin, it was carried\r\nto Pescarenico, but it was never known what farther became of it. Renzo,\r\nnot receiving an answer, caused another letter to be written, and\r\nenclosed it to one of his relations at Lecco. This time the letter\r\nreached its destination. Agnes requested her cousin Alessio to read it\r\nfor her; and to write an answer, which was sent to Antonio Rivolta, at\r\nthe place of his abode; all this, however, was not done so quickly as\r\nwe tell it. Renzo received the answer, and wrote a reply; in short,\r\nthere was a correspondence, however irregular, established between them.\r\nBut the manner of carrying on such a correspondence, which is the same,\r\nperhaps, at this day, we will explain. The absent party who can\xe2\x80\x99t write,\r\nselects one who possesses the art, from amongst his own class, in which\r\nhe can more securely trust. To him he explains with more or less\r\nclearness his subject and his thoughts. The man of letters comprehends\r\npart, guesses the rest, gives an opinion, proposes an alteration, and\r\nfinishes with \xe2\x80\x9cleave it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then begins the translation of the\r\nspoken into the written thoughts.\xe2\x80\x94The writer corrects, improves,\r\novercharges, diminishes, or even omits, according to his opinion of the\r\ngraces of style. The finished letter is, accordingly, often wide of the\r\nmark aimed at. But when, at length, it reaches the hands of a\r\ncorrespondent, equally deficient in the art of reading running hand, he\r\nis under the like necessity of finding a learned clerk of the same\r\ncalibre to interpret the hieroglyphics. Hereupon arise questions upon\r\nthe various meanings. Towards their elucidation, the one supplies\r\nphilological notices upon the text; the other, commentaries upon the\r\nhidden matter; so that, after mature discussion, they may come to the\r\nsame understanding between themselves, however remote that may be from\r\nthe intention of the originator of the perplexity.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely the condition of our two correspondents.\r\n\r\nThe first letter from Renzo contained many details; he informed Agnes of\r\nthe circumstance of his flight, his subsequent adventures, and his\r\nactual situation. These events, however, were rather hinted at, than\r\nclearly explained, so that Agnes and her interpreter were far from\r\ndrawing any definite conclusions from the relation of them. He spoke of\r\nsecret information, of a change of name; that he was in safety, but that\r\nhe was obliged to keep himself concealed; further, the letter contained\r\npressing and passionate enquiries with regard to Lucy, with some obscure\r\nreferences to the reports which had reached him, mingled with vague\r\nexpressions of hope, and plans for the future, and affectionate\r\nexhortations to constancy and patience.\r\n\r\nSome time after the receipt of this letter, Agnes sent Renzo an answer,\r\nwith the fifty crowns that had been assigned him by Lucy. At the sight\r\nof so much gold, he did not know what to think; and, with his mind\r\nagitated by reflections by no means agreeable, he went in search of his\r\namanuensis, requesting him to interpret the letter, and afford him a\r\nclue to the developement of the mystery.\r\n\r\nThe amanuensis of Agnes, after some complaints on the want of clearness\r\nin Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s epistle, described the wonderful history of _this person_ (so\r\nhe called the Unknown), and thus accounted for the fifty crowns; then he\r\nmentioned the vow, but only periphrastically; adding more explicitly the\r\nadvice, to set his heart at rest, and not to think of Lucy any more.\r\n\r\nRenzo was very near quarrelling with his interpreter; he trembled; he\r\nwas enraged with what he had understood, and with what he had not\r\nunderstood. He made him read three or four times this melancholy\r\nepistle, sometimes understanding it better, sometimes finding obscure\r\nand inexplicable that which at first had appeared clear. In the delirium\r\nof his passion, he desired his amanuensis to write an answer\r\nimmediately. After the strongest expressions of pity and horror at the\r\nmisfortunes of Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cWrite,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do not wish to set my\r\nheart at rest, and that I never will; that this is not advice to give\r\nme; and that, moreover, I will never touch the money, but will keep it\r\nin trust, as the dowry of the young girl; that Lucy belongs to me, and\r\nthat I will not abide by her vow; that I have always heard that the\r\nVirgin interests herself in our affairs, for the purpose of aiding the\r\nafflicted, and obtaining favour for them; but that I have never heard\r\nthat she will protect those who do evil, and fail to perform their\r\npromises; say that, as such cannot be the case, her vow is good for\r\nnothing; that with this money we can establish ourselves here, and that,\r\nif our affairs are now a little perplexed, it is a storm which will soon\r\npass away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgnes received this letter, sent an answer, and the correspondence\r\ncontinued for some time, as we have related. When her mother informed\r\nLucy that Renzo was well and in safety, she derived great relief from\r\nthe intelligence, desiring but one thing more, which was, that he should\r\nforget, or rather, that he should endeavour to forget her. On her part\r\nshe made a similar resolution, with respect to him, a hundred times a\r\nday; and employing every means of which she was mistress to accomplish\r\nso desirable an end, she applied herself incessantly to labour,\r\nendeavouring to give to it all the powers of her soul. When the image of\r\nRenzo occurred to her mind, she tried to banish it by prayer; but, while\r\nthinking of her mother, (and how could she avoid thinking of her\r\nmother?) the image of Renzo intruded himself as a third into the place\r\nso often occupied by the real Renzo. However, if she did not succeed in\r\nforgetting, she contrived at least to think less frequently of him; and\r\nin this she would have been more successful, had she been left to\r\nprosecute the work alone; but, alas! Donna Prassede, who, on her part,\r\nwas determined to drive the poor youth from her mind, thought there was\r\nno better expedient for the purpose than to talk of him incessantly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you still think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think of no one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy.\r\n\r\nDonna Prassede, who was not a woman to be satisfied with such an answer,\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she wanted actions, not words.\xe2\x80\x9d Discussing at length, the\r\ntendencies of young girls, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they have once given their\r\nheart to a libertine, it is impossible to withdraw their affections. If\r\ntheir love for an honest man is, by whatever means, unfortunate, they\r\nare soon comforted, but love for a libertine is an incurable wound.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen beginning the panegyric of poor Renzo, of this rascal, who wished\r\nto deluge Milan in blood, and reduce it to ashes, she concluded, by\r\ninsisting that Lucy should confess the crimes of which he had been\r\nguilty in his own country.\r\n\r\nLucy, with a voice trembling from shame, grief, and from as much\r\nindignation as her gentle disposition and humble station permitted her,\r\ndeclared and protested, that in her village this poor youth had always\r\nacted peaceably and honourably, and had obtained a good reputation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wished,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of his countrymen were present to bear\r\ntestimony to the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Even respecting the events at Milan, of which,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas true, she knew not the details, she defended him, and solely on\r\naccount of the acquaintance she had had with his habits from infancy.\r\nShe defended him (or rather, she _meant_ to defend him) from the pure\r\nduty of charity, from love of truth, and as being her neighbour. But\r\nDonna Prassede deduced, from this defence, new arguments to convince\r\nLucy, that this man still held a place in her heart, of which he was not\r\nworthy. At the degrading portrait which the old lady drew of him, the\r\nhabitual feelings of her heart, with regard to him, and her knowledge\r\nand estimate of his character, revived with double force and\r\ndistinctness. Her recollections, which she had had so much difficulty in\r\nsubduing, returned vividly to her imagination; in proportion to the\r\naversion and contempt manifested by Donna Prassede towards the\r\nunfortunate youth, just in such proportion did she recall her former\r\nmotives for esteem and sympathy; this blind and violent hatred excited\r\nin her heart stronger pity and tenderness. Such conversations could not\r\nbe much prolonged without resolving Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s words into tears.\r\n\r\nIf Donna Prassede had been led to this course of conduct by hatred\r\ntowards Lucy, the tears of the latter, which flowed freely during these\r\nexaminations, might have subdued her to silence, but as she was moved to\r\nspeak by the desire of doing good, she never suffered herself to be\r\nsoftened by them; for groans and supplications may arrest the arm of an\r\nenemy, but not the friendly lance of the surgeon. After having\r\nreproached her for her wickedness, she passed to exhortations and\r\nadvice, mingling also a few praises, to temper the bitter with the\r\nsweet, and obtain more certainly the effect she desired. These disputes,\r\nwhich had nearly the same beginning, middle, and end, did not, however,\r\nleave any trace of resentment against her severe lecturer in the gentle\r\nbosom of Lucy; she was, in other respects, treated with much kindness by\r\nthe lady, and she believed her, even in this matter, to be guided by\r\ngood, though mistaken intentions. There did follow them, however, such\r\nagitation, such uneasy awakening of slumbering thoughts, that much time\r\nand effort were requisite to restore her to any degree of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIt was a happiness for Lucy that Donna Prassede\xe2\x80\x99s sphere of usefulness\r\nwas somewhat extensive; consequently these tiresome conversations could\r\nnot be so frequently repeated. Besides her immediate household,\r\ncomposed, according to her opinion, of persons that had more or less\r\nneed of correction and regulation; and besides all the other occasions\r\nwhich presented themselves for her rendering the same office from pure\r\nbenevolence to persons who required not the duty at her hands; she had\r\nfive daughters, neither of whom lived at home, but they gave her the\r\nmore trouble from that very cause. Three were nuns; and two were\r\nmarried. Donna Prassede consequently had three monasteries and two\r\nfamilies to govern; a vast and complicated machinery, and the more\r\ntroublesome, as two husbands, supported by a numerous kindred, three\r\nabbesses, defended by other dignitaries, and a great number of nuns,\r\nwould not accept her superintendence. There was a continual warfare,\r\npolite indeed, but active and vigilant; a perpetual attention to avoid\r\nher solicitude, to close up the avenues to her advice, to elude her\r\nenquiries, and to keep her in as much ignorance as possible of their\r\naffairs. In her own family, however, her zeal could display itself\r\nfreely; all were governed by her authority, and submissive to her, in\r\nevery respect, with the exception of Don Ferrante; with him things were\r\nconducted in a peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nA man of study, he neither loved to obey nor command; he was perfectly\r\nwilling that his wife should be mistress in all things pertaining to\r\nhousehold affairs, but not that he should be her slave; and if, at her\r\nrequest, he lent upon occasion the services of his pen, it was because\r\nhe had a particular taste for such employments. And, moreover, he could\r\nrefuse to do it, when not convinced of the propriety of her demand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cdo it yourself, since the matter appears so plain\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d Donna Prassede, after vainly trying to induce him to\r\nsubmission, took refuge in grumbling against him as an original, a man\r\nwho would have his own way, a mere scholar; which latter title,\r\nhowever, she never gave him without a degree of complacency, mingling\r\nitself with her displeasure.\r\n\r\nDon Ferrante passed much time in his study, where he had a considerable\r\ncollection of choice books; he had selected the most famous works on\r\nmany different subjects, in each of which he was more or less versed. In\r\nastrology he was justly considered more than an amateur, because he not\r\nonly possessed the general notions, and the common vocabulary of\r\ninfluences, aspects, and conjunctions, but he could speak to the point,\r\nand, like a professor, of the twelve houses of heaven, of the great and\r\nlesser circles, of degrees, lucid and obscure, of exaltations, passages,\r\nand revolutions; in short, of the principles the most certain and most\r\nrecondite of the science. For more than twenty years, in long and\r\nfrequent disputes, he had sustained the pre-eminence of _Cardan_ against\r\nanother learned man attached to the system of _Alcabizio_, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom pure\r\nobstinacy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Ferrante, who, in acknowledging voluntarily the\r\nsuperiority of the ancients, could not, however, endure the prejudice\r\nwhich would never accord to the moderns, even that which they evidently\r\ndeserved. He had also a more than ordinary acquaintance with the history\r\nof the science; he could cite the most celebrated predictions which had\r\nbeen verified, and reason very skilfully and learnedly on other\r\ncelebrated predictions which had _not_ been verified, demonstrating that\r\nthe failure was not owing to any deficiency in the science, but to the\r\nignorance which could not apply its principles.\r\n\r\nHe had acquired as much ancient philosophy as would have contented a man\r\nof ordinary ambition, but he was continually adding to his stock from\r\nthe study of Diogenes Laertius; however, as we cannot adhere to every\r\nsystem, and as, from among them all, a choice is necessary to him who\r\ndesires the reputation of a philosopher, Don Ferrante made choice of\r\nAristotle, who, as he was accustomed to say, was neither ancient nor\r\nmodern. He possessed many works of the wisest and most subtle disciples\r\nof the school of Aristotle among the moderns; as to those of his\r\nopponents, he would not read them, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it would be a waste of\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnor buy them, because it would be a waste of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIn the judgment of the learned, therefore, Don Ferrante passed for an\r\naccomplished peripatetic, although this was not the judgment he passed\r\non himself, for, more than once, he was heard to declare, with singular\r\nmodesty, that the essence, the universals, the soul of the world, and\r\nthe nature of things, were not matters so clear as people thought.\r\n\r\nAs to natural philosophy, he had made it more a pastime than a study: he\r\nhad rather read than digested the works of Aristotle himself on the\r\nsubject. Nevertheless, with a slight acquaintance with that author, and\r\nthe knowledge he had incidentally gathered from other treatises of\r\ngeneral philosophy, he could, when necessary, entertain an assembly of\r\nlearned persons in reasoning most acutely on the wonderful virtues and\r\nsingular characteristics of many plants. He could describe exactly the\r\nforms and habits of the syrens, and the ph\xc5\x93nix, the only one of its\r\nkind; he could explain how it was that the salamander lived in fire, how\r\ndrops of dew became pearls in the shell, how the chameleon lived on air,\r\nand a thousand other secrets of the same nature.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, much more addicted to the study of magic and sorcery,\r\nas this was a science more in vogue, and withal more serviceable, and\r\nthe facts of which were of pre-eminent importance. It is not necessary\r\nto add that, in devotion to such a science, he had no other purpose than\r\nto obtain an accurate knowledge of the worst artifices of the sorcerers,\r\nin order to guard himself against them. Guided by the great _Martino\r\nDelrio_, he was able to discourse, _ex professo_, on the enchantment of\r\nlove, the enchantment of sleep, the enchantment of hatred, and on the\r\ninnumerable species of these three chief enchantments, which, alas! are\r\nwitnessed every day in their destructive and baneful effects.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of history, especially universal history, was not less\r\nvast and solid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said he often, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is history without politics?\r\na guide who conducts without teaching any one the way; as politics\r\nwithout history, is a man without a guide to conduct him.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was then\r\na small place on his shelf assigned to statistics; there, among others\r\nof the second rank, were seen Bodin, Cavalcanti, Sansovino, Paruta, and\r\nBoccalini. There were, however, two books that Don Ferrante preferred to\r\nall others on the subject; two, which he called, for a long time, the\r\nfirst of the kind, without deciding to which of the two this rank\r\nexclusively belonged. One was _Il Principe_ and the _Discorsi_ of the\r\ncelebrated secretary of Florence. \xe2\x80\x9cA rascal, \xe2\x80\x99tis true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nprofound;\xe2\x80\x9d the other, _La Ragion di Stato_, of the not less celebrated\r\nGiovanni Botero. \xe2\x80\x9cAn honest man, \xe2\x80\x99tis true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut cunning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut, a short time before the period to which our history belongs, a work\r\nappeared which had terminated the question of pre-eminence; a work in\r\nwhich was comprised and condensed a relation of every vice, in order to\r\nenable men to avoid it, and every virtue, in order to enable men to\r\npractise it,\xe2\x80\x94a book of few leaves, indeed, but all of gold; in a word,\r\nthe _Statista Regnante_ of _Don Valeriano Castiglione_; of the\r\ncelebrated man upon whom the most learned men emulated each other in\r\nbestowing praises, and for whose notice the greatest personages\r\ncontended; whom Pope Urban VIII. honoured with a magnificent eulogium;\r\nwhom Cardinal Borghese and the Viceroy of Naples, Don Pietro de Toledo,\r\nsolicited to write, the first, the life of Pope Paul V., the second, the\r\nwars of the Catholic king in Italy, and both in vain; whom Louis XIII.,\r\nKing of France, with the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, named his\r\nhistoriographer; upon whom the Duke Carlos Emanuel, of Savoy, conferred\r\nthe same office; and in praise of whom the Duchess Christina, daughter\r\nto his most Christian majesty, Henry IV., added in a diploma, after many\r\nother titles, \xe2\x80\x9cthe renown he had obtained in Italy as the first writer\r\nof the age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut if Don Ferrante might be said to be well versed in all the above\r\nsciences, there was one in which he deserved, and really obtained, the\r\ntitle of professor, the science of chivalry. He not only spoke of it as\r\na master, but was often requested to interfere in nice points of honour,\r\nand give his decision. He had in his library, and, we may add, in his\r\nhead also, the works of the most esteemed writers on this subject,\r\nparticularly Torquato Tasso, whom he had always ready; and he could, if\r\nrequired, cite from memory all the passages of the Jerusalem Delivered,\r\nwhich might be brought forward as authority in these matters. We might\r\nspeak more at large of this learned man, but we feel it to be time to\r\nresume the thread of our history.\r\n\r\nNothing of importance occurred to any of the personages of our story\r\nbefore the following autumn, when Agnes and Lucy expected to meet again;\r\nbut a great public event disappointed this hope. Other events followed,\r\nwhich produced no material change in their destiny. Then occurred new\r\nmisfortunes, powerful and overwhelming, coming upon them like a\r\nhurricane, which impetuously tears up and scatters every object in its\r\nway, sweeping the land, and bearing off, with its irresistible and\r\nmighty power, every vestige of peace and prosperity. That the particular\r\nfacts which remain to be related may not appear obscure, we must recur\r\nfor awhile to the farther recital of general facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the famous sedition on St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s day, it may be said that\r\nabundance flowed into Milan, as if by enchantment. The shops were well\r\nstored with bread, the price of which was no higher than in the most\r\nfruitful years; those who, on that terrible day, had howled through the\r\nstreets, and committed every excess in their power, had now reason to\r\ncongratulate themselves. But, with the cessation of their alarm, they\r\nhad not resumed their accustomed quiet; on the squares, and in the inns,\r\nthere were congratulations and boastings (although in an under tone) at\r\nhaving hit on a mode of reducing the price of bread. However, in the\r\nmidst of these popular rejoicings, there reigned a vague apprehension\r\nand presentiment that this happiness would be of short duration. They\r\nbesieged the bakers and vendors of flour with the same pertinacity as\r\nduring the period of the former factitious and transient abundance,\r\nproduced by the first tariff of Antony Ferrer. He who had some pence by\r\nhim converted them immediately into bread and flour, which was piled in\r\nchests, in small casks, and even in vessels of earthen ware. In thus\r\nattempting to extend the advantages of the moment, their long duration\r\nwas rendered, I do not say impossible, for it was so already; but even\r\ntheir momentary continuance thus became still more difficult.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of November, Antony Ferrer, \xe2\x80\x9c_by the order of his\r\nexcellency_,\xe2\x80\x9d published a decree in which it was forbidden to any one,\r\nhaving any quantity of grain or flour in his house, to purchase more;\r\nand to the rest of the people to buy bread beyond that which was\r\nnecessary for two days, \xe2\x80\x9c_under pecuniary and corporal penalties at the\r\ndiscretion of his excellency_.\xe2\x80\x9d The decree ordered the _anziani_\r\n(officers of justice), and invited every body, as a duty, to denounce\r\nthe offenders; it commanded the judges to cause search to be made in\r\nevery house which might be mentioned to them, issuing at the same time a\r\nnew command to the bakers to keep their shops well furnished with bread,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_under penalty of five years in the galleys, and still greater\r\npunishment at the discretion of his excellency_.\xe2\x80\x9d A great effort of\r\nimagination would be required to believe that such orders were easy of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIn commanding the bakers to make such a quantity of bread, means ought\r\nto have been afforded for the supply of the material of which it was to\r\nbe made. In seasons of scarcity, there is always an endeavour to make\r\ninto bread various kinds of aliment, which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, are consumed under other forms. In this way rice was\r\nintroduced into the composition of a bread which was called mistura.[33]\r\nOn the 23d of November, there was a decree issued, which placed at the\r\norder of the vicar and twelve members of provision the half of the rice\r\nthat each possessed; under penalty for selling it without the permission\r\nof those lords of the loss of the entire commodity, and a fine of three\r\ncrowns the bushel.\r\n\r\n      [33] Mixture.\r\n\r\nBut this rice had to be paid for at a price very disproportioned to that\r\nof bread. The burden of supplying this enormous difference was imposed\r\non the city: but the council of ten resolved to send a remonstrance to\r\nthe governor, on the impossibility of sustaining such a tax; and the\r\ngovernor fixed, by a decree of the 13th of December, the price of rice\r\nat twelve livres the bushel. It is also probable, though nowhere\r\nexpressly stated, that the maximum price for other sorts of grain was\r\nfixed by other proclamations. Whilst, by these various measures, bread\r\nand flour were kept at a low price in Milan, it consequently happened\r\nthat crowds of people rushed into the city to supply their wants. Don\r\nGonzalo, to remedy this inconvenience, forbade, by another decree of the\r\n15th of December, the carrying out of the city bread to the value of\r\nmore than twenty pence; the penalty was a fine of \xe2\x80\x9c_twenty-five crowns,\r\nand in case of inability, a public flogging, and greater punishments\r\nstill, at the discretion of his excellency_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe populace wished to procure abundance by pillage and conflagration,\r\nthe legal power wished to maintain it by the galleys and the rope. Every\r\nmethod was resorted to to accomplish their purpose, but the reader will\r\nsoon learn the total failure of them all. It is, besides, easy to see,\r\nand not useless to observe, that these strange means had an intimate and\r\nnecessary connection with each other; each was the inevitable\r\nconsequence of the preceding, and all, in fact, flowed from the first\r\nerror, that of fixing upon bread a price so disproportioned to that\r\nwhich ought to have resulted from the real state of things. Such an\r\nexpedient, however, has always appeared to the populace not only\r\nconformable to equity, but very simple and easy of execution; it is then\r\nvery natural that in the agonies and misery which are the necessary\r\neffects of scarcity, they should, if it be in their power, adopt it. But\r\nas the consequences begin to be felt, the government is obliged to\r\nrepair the evil by new laws, forbidding men to do that which previous\r\nlaws had recently prescribed to them.\r\n\r\nThe principal fruits of the insurrection were these; the destruction or\r\nloss of much provision in the insurrection itself, and the rapid\r\nconsumption of the small quantity of grain then on hand, which should\r\notherwise have lasted until the next harvest. To these general effects\r\nmay be added, the punishment of four of the populace, who were hung as\r\nleaders of the sedition, two before the baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop of the crutches,\r\nand two at the corner of the street in which was situated the house of\r\nthe superintendent of provision.\r\n\r\nThe historical relations of this epoch are handed down to us with so\r\nlittle clearness, that it is difficult to ascertain when this arbitrary\r\ntariff ceased. But we have numerous accounts of the situation of the\r\ncountry, and especially the city, in the winter of that year and the\r\nfollowing spring. In every quarter shops were closed; and the\r\nmanufactories were, for the most part, deserted; the streets afforded a\r\nterrible spectacle of sorrow and desolation; mendicants by profession,\r\nnow the smallest number, were confounded with the new multitude,\r\ndisputing for alms with those from whom they had formerly been\r\naccustomed to receive them; clerks and servants, dismissed by the\r\nmerchants and shopkeepers, hardly existing upon some scanty savings;\r\nmerchants and shopkeepers themselves failing and ruined by the stoppage\r\nof trade; artificers wandering from door to door, lying along the\r\npavement, by the houses and churches, soliciting charity, and hesitating\r\nbetween want and shame, emaciated and feeble, reduced by long fasting,\r\nand the rigours of the cold which penetrated their tattered clothing;\r\nservants, dismissed by their masters, who were incapable of maintaining\r\ntheir accustomed numerous and sumptuous establishments; and the numerous\r\ndependents upon the labour of these various classes, old men, women, and\r\nchildren, grouped around their former supporters, or wandered in search\r\nof support elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAmong the wretched crowds also might be distinguished, by their _long\r\nlock_, by the remnants of their magnificent apparel, by their carriage\r\nand gestures, and by the traces which habit impresses on the\r\ncountenance, many _bravoes_, who, having lost in the common misery their\r\ncriminal means of support, were reduced to an equality of suffering, and\r\nwith difficulty dragged themselves along the city that they had so often\r\ntraversed with a proud and ferocious bearing, magnificently armed and\r\nattired; they now extended with humility the hand which they had so\r\nfrequently raised to menace with insolence, or to strike with treachery.\r\n\r\nBut the most dense, livid, and hideous swarm was that of the villagers.\r\nThese were seen in entire families; husbands with their wives, dragging\r\nalong their little ones, and supporting in their arms their wretched\r\nbabies, whilst their own aged and helpless parents followed behind,\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nflocked into the city in hopes of obtaining bread. Some, whose houses\r\nhad been invaded and despoiled by the soldiery, had fled in despair;\r\nsome, to excite compassion, and render their misery more striking,\r\nshowed the wounds and bruises they had received in defending their\r\nhomes; and others, whom this scourge had not reached, had been driven,\r\nby the two scourges from which no corner of the country was exempt,\r\nsterility and the consequent increase on the price of provisions, to the\r\ncity, as to the abode of abundance and pious munificence. The new comers\r\nmight be recognised by their air of angry astonishment and\r\ndisappointment at finding such an excess of misery where they had hoped\r\nto be themselves the peculiar objects of compassion and benevolence.\r\nHere, too, might be recognised, in all their varieties of ragged\r\nhabiliments, in the midst of the general wretchedness, the pale dweller\r\nof the marsh, the bronzed countenance of the plain or hill countryman,\r\nand the sanguine complexion of the mountaineer, all, however, alike in\r\nthe hollow eye, ferocious or insane countenance, knotted hair, long and\r\nmatted beard, attenuated body, shrivelled skin and bony breast,\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nalike reduced to the lowest condition of languor, of infantine debility.\r\n\r\nHeaps of straw and stubble were seen along the walls, and by the\r\ngutters, which appeared to be a particular provision of charity for\r\nthese unfortunate creatures; there their limbs reposed during the night;\r\nand in the day they were occupied by those who, exhausted by fatigue and\r\nsuffering, could no longer bear the weight of their emaciated bodies;\r\nsometimes, upon the damp straw a dead body lay extended; sometimes, the\r\nmiserable spark of life was rekindled in its feeble tenement by timely\r\nsuccour from a hand rich in the means and in the disposition to do\r\ngood, the hand of the pious Frederick.\r\n\r\nHe had made choice of six priests of ardent charity and robust\r\nconstitution; and, dividing them into three companies, assigned to each\r\nthe third of the city as their charge; they were accompanied by porters,\r\nladen with food, cordials, and clothing. Each morning these worthy\r\nmessengers of benevolence passed through the streets, approached those\r\nwhom they beheld stretched on the pavement, and gave to each their\r\nkindly assistance. Those who were too ill to be benefited by temporal\r\nsuccour received from them the last offices of religion.\r\n\r\nTheir assistance was not limited to present relief: the good bishop\r\nrequested them, wherever it was possible, to furnish more efficacious\r\nand permanent comfort, by giving to those who should be in some measure\r\nrestored to strength money for their future necessities, lest returning\r\nwant should again plunge them into wretchedness and misery; and to\r\nobtain shelter for others who lay exposed in the street in the\r\nneighbouring houses, by requesting their inhabitants to receive the poor\r\nafflicted ones as boarders, whose expenses would be paid by the cardinal\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFrederick had not waited for the evil to attain its height, in order to\r\nexercise his benevolence, and to devote all the powers of his mind\r\ntowards its amelioration. By uniting all his means, by practising strict\r\neconomy, by drawing upon the sums destined to other liberalities, and\r\nwhich had now become of secondary importance, he endeavoured to amass\r\nmoney, in order to employ it entirely for those who were suffering from\r\nhunger and its consequences. He bought a quantity of grain, and sent it\r\nto the most destitute parts of his diocese; but as the succour was far\r\nfrom adequate to the necessity, he sent with it a great quantity of\r\nsalt, \xe2\x80\x9cwith which,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ripamonti[34], relating the fact, \xe2\x80\x9cthe herbs of\r\nthe field and the leaves of trees were made food for men.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndistributed grain and money to the curates of the city; and he himself\r\ntravelled over it, administering alms, and secretly aiding many indigent\r\nfamilies. In the episcopal palace, rice was boiled every day, and dealt\r\nout to the necessities of the people, to the extent of 2000 measures.\r\nBesides these splendid efforts of a single individual, many other\r\nexcellent persons, though with less powerful means, strove to mitigate\r\nthe horrible sufferings of the people: of these sufferers, thousands\r\nstruggled to grasp the broth or other food provided at different\r\nquarters, and thus prolong for a day, at least, their miserable lives;\r\nbut thousands were still left behind in the struggle, and these\r\ngenerally the weakest,\xe2\x80\x94the aged women and children; and these might be\r\nseen, dead and dying from inanition, in every part. But in the midst of\r\nthese calamities not the least disposition to insurrection appeared.\r\n\r\n      [34] Historia Patri\xc3\xa6, decad. v. lib. vi. p. 386.\r\n\r\nThe void that mortality created each day in the miserable multitude was\r\neach day more than replenished; there was a perpetual concourse, at\r\nfirst from the neighbouring villages, then from the more distant\r\nterritories, and, finally, from the Milanese cities.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary spectacle of ordinary times, the contrast of magnificent\r\napparel with rags, and of luxury with poverty, had entirely disappeared.\r\nThe nobility even wore coarse clothing; some, because the general misery\r\nhad affected their fortune; others, because they would not insult the\r\nwretchedness of the people, or because they feared to provoke the\r\ngeneral despair by the display of luxury at such a time.\r\n\r\nThus passed the winter and the spring; already had the Tribunal of\r\nHealth remonstrated with the Tribunal of Provision on the danger to\r\nwhich such mass of misery exposed the city. To prevent contagious\r\ndiseases, a proposal was made to confine the vagabond beggars in the\r\nvarious hospitals. Whilst this project was under discussion, some\r\napproving and others condemning, dead bodies incumbered the streets. The\r\nTribunal of Provision, however, proposed another expedient as more easy\r\nand expeditious, which was, to shut up all the mendicants, healthy or\r\ndiseased, in the lazaretto, and to maintain them there at the expense of\r\nthe city. This measure was resolved upon, notwithstanding the\r\nremonstrances of the Tribunal of Health, who objected that, in so\r\nnumerous an assemblage, the evil to which they wished to apply a remedy\r\nwould be greatly augmented.\r\n\r\nThe little order that reigned in the lazaretto, the bad quality of the\r\nfood, and the standing water which was drank plentifully, soon created\r\nnumerous maladies. To these causes of mortality, so much the more active\r\nfrom operating on bodies already exhausted or enfeebled, was added the\r\nunfavourableness of the season; obstinate rains, followed by more\r\nobstinate drought, and violent heat. To these physical evils were added\r\nothers of a moral nature, despair and wearisomeness in captivity, desire\r\nfor accustomed habits, regret for cherished beings of whom these\r\nunfortunate beings had been deprived; painful apprehension for those who\r\nwere living, and the continual dread of death, which had itself become a\r\nnew and powerful cause of the extension of disease. It is not to be\r\nwondered at that mortality increased in this species of prison to such a\r\ndegree as to assume the appearance and deserve the name of _pestilence_.\r\nThe number of deaths in the lazaretto soon amounted to a hundred daily.\r\n\r\nWhilst within these wretched walls, grief, fear, anguish, and rage\r\nprevailed, in the Tribunal of Provision, shame, astonishment, and\r\nirresolution were equally apparent. They consulted, and now listened to\r\nthe advice of the Tribunal of Health: finding they could do no better\r\nthan to undo what they had done, at so much expense and trouble, they\r\nopened the doors of the lazaretto, and released all who were well enough\r\nto leave it. The city was thus again filled with its former cries, but\r\nfeebler, and more interrupted; the sick were transported to Santa Maria\r\ndella Stella, which was then the hospital for the poor, and the greater\r\npart perished there.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fields began to yield the harvest so long desired, and the\r\ntroops of peasants left the city for their long prayed for and\r\naccustomed labours. The ingenious and inexhaustible charity of the good\r\nFrederick still exerted itself; he made a present of a giulio[35] and a\r\nsickle to each peasant, who solicited it at the palace.\r\n\r\n      [35] A coin worth about 6_d._\r\n\r\nWith a plentiful harvest, scarcity ceased to be felt; the mortality,\r\nhowever, continued, in a greater or less degree, until the middle of\r\nautumn. It was on the point of ceasing, when a new scourge overwhelmed\r\nthe city and country.\r\n\r\nMany events of high historical importance had occurred in this interval\r\nof time. The Cardinal Richelieu, after having taken Rochelle, and made a\r\ntreaty of peace with England, had proposed, effected by his powerful\r\ninfluence in the councils of the French king, that efficacious aid\r\nshould be sent to the Duke of Nevers; he had also persuaded the king to\r\nlead the expedition in person. Whilst the preparations were in progress,\r\nthe Count of Nassau, imperial commissary, suggested to the new duke in\r\nMantua the expediency of replacing his states in the hands of Ferdinand;\r\nintimating that, in case of refusal, an army would be immediately sent\r\nby the emperor to occupy them. The duke, who in the most desperate\r\ncircumstances had rejected so hard a condition, encouraged now by the\r\npromised succours from France, was determined still longer to defend\r\nhimself. The commissary departed, declaring that force would soon decide\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, the Cardinal Richelieu with the king, at the head\r\nof an army, demanded a free passage from the Duke of Savoy; he entered\r\ninto treaties for the purpose, but nothing was concluded. After a\r\nrencounter, in which the French obtained the advantage, a new treaty was\r\nentered into, in which the duke stipulated that Don Gonzalo de Cordova\r\nshould raise the siege of Casale, engaging, in case of his refusal, to\r\nunite with the French, and invade the duchy of Milan. Don Gonzalo raised\r\nthe siege of Casale, and a body of French troops entered it, to\r\nreinforce the garrison. The Cardinal Richelieu decided to return to\r\nFrance, on business which he regarded as more urgent; but Girolamo\r\nSoranzo, envoy from Venice, offered the most powerful reasons to divert\r\nhim from this resolution. To these the king and the cardinal paid no\r\nattention; they returned with the greatest part of the army, leaving\r\nonly 6000 men at Suza to occupy the passes and maintain the treaty.\r\n\r\nWhilst this army departed on one side, that of Ferdinand, commanded by\r\nthe Count of Collato, advanced on the other. It had invaded the country\r\nof the Grisons, and the Valtelline, and was preparing to come down on\r\nthe Milanese. Besides the usual terrors which such an expectation was\r\ncalculated to excite, the report was spread, that the plague lurked in\r\nthe imperial army. Alessandro Tadino, one of the conservators of the\r\npublic health, was charged by the tribunal to state to the governor the\r\nfrightful danger which threatened the country, if this army should\r\nobtain the pass which opened on Mantua. It appears from all the actions\r\nof Gonzalo, that he was possessed by a desire to occupy a great place in\r\nhistory; but, as often happens, history has failed to register one of\r\nhis most remarkable acts, the answer he returned to this Doctor Tadino;\r\nwhich was, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he knew not what could be done; that reasons of\r\ninterest and honour, which had induced the march of the army, were of\r\ngreater weight than the danger represented; that he would, however,\r\nendeavour to act for the best, and that they must trust to Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order, then, to act for the best, their two physicians proposed to\r\nthe tribunal to forbid, under the most severe penalty, the purchase of\r\nany articles of clothing from the soldiers who were about to pass. As to\r\nDon Gonzalo, his reply to Doctor Tadino was one of his last acts at\r\nMilan, as the ill success of the war, which had been instigated and\r\ndirected by him, caused him to be displaced in the course of the summer.\r\nHe was succeeded by Marquis Ambrosio Spinola, who had already acquired\r\nthe military celebrity in the wars of Flanders which still endures.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the German troops had received definite orders to march upon\r\nMantua, and in the month of September they entered the duchy of Milan.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch armies were composed, for the greater part, of\r\nadventurers, enlisted by _condottieri_, who held their commission from\r\nsome prince, and who sometimes pursued the occupation on their own\r\naccount, so as to be able to sell themselves and followers together. Men\r\nwere drawn to this vocation much less by the pay which was assigned to\r\nthem, than by the hope of pillage, and the charms of licence. There was\r\nno fixed or general discipline; and as their pay was very uncertain, the\r\nspoils of the countries which they over-ran were tacitly accorded to\r\nthem by their commanders.\r\n\r\nIt was a saying of the celebrated Wallenstein\xe2\x80\x99s, that it was easier to\r\nmaintain an army of 100,000 men than one of 12,000. And this army of\r\nwhich we are now speaking was part of that which in the thirty years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwar had desolated all Germany; it was commanded by one of Wallenstein\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlieutenants, and consisted of 28,000 infantry, and 7000 horse. In\r\ndescending from the Valtelline towards Milan, they had to coast along\r\nthe Adda, to the place where it empties into the Po; eight days\xe2\x80\x99 march\r\nin the duchy of Milan.\r\n\r\nA great proportion of the inhabitants retired to the mountains, carrying\r\nwith them their most precious possessions; some remained to watch the\r\nsick, or to preserve their dwellings from the flames, or to watch the\r\nvaluable property which they had buried or concealed; and others\r\nremained because they had nothing to lose. When the first detachment\r\narrived at the place where they were to halt, the soldiers scattered\r\nthemselves through the country; and subjected it at once to pillage; all\r\nthat could be eaten or carried off disappeared; fields were destroyed,\r\nand cottages burnt to the ground; every hiding-place, every method to\r\nwhich people had resorted, in their despair, for the defence of their\r\nproperty, became useless, nay, often resulted in the peculiar injury of\r\nthe proprietor. Strict search was made throughout every house by the\r\nsoldiers; they easily detected in the gardens the earth which had been\r\nnewly dug; they penetrated the caverns in search of the opulent\r\ninhabitants, who had taken refuge there, and dragging them to their\r\nhouses, forced them to declare where they had concealed their treasures.\r\n\r\nAt last they departed; their drums and trumpets were heard receding in\r\nthe distance, and a temporary calm succeeded to these hours of tumult\r\nand affright; but, alas! the sound of drums was again heard, announcing\r\nthe arrival of another detachment, the soldiers of which, furious at not\r\nfinding booty, destroyed what the first work of desolation had spared;\r\nburned the furniture and the houses, and manifested the most cruel and\r\nsavage disposition towards the inhabitants. This continued for a period\r\nof twenty days, the army containing that number of divisions.\r\n\r\nColico was the first territory of the duchy that these demons invaded;\r\nthey then threw themselves on Bellano, from which they entered and\r\nspread themselves in the Valsassina, whence they marched into the\r\nterritory of Lecco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, among those who were expecting the arrival of the army in alarm\r\nand consternation, we find persons of our acquaintance. He who did not\r\nbehold Don Abbondio on the day when the report was spread of the descent\r\nof the army, of its near approach, and its excesses, can have no idea of\r\nthe power of fright upon a feeble mind. All sorts of reports were\r\nafloat. They are coming\xe2\x80\x94thirty, forty, fifty thousand men. They have\r\nsacked Cortenova; burnt Primaluna; plundered Introbbio, Pasturo, Barsio.\r\nThey have been seen at Balobbio; to-morrow they will be here. Such were\r\nthe statements in circulation. The villagers assembled in tumultuous\r\ncrowds, hesitating whether to fly or remain, while the women lamented\r\naloud over their miserable fate.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio, to whom flight had immediately suggested itself, saw in\r\nit, nevertheless, invincible obstacles, and frightful dangers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere shall I go?\xe2\x80\x9d The mountains, without\r\nspeaking of the difficulty of ascending them, were not safe; the foot\r\nsoldiers climbed them like cats, if they had the slightest indication or\r\nhope of booty; the waters of the lake were swollen; it was blowing\r\nviolently; in addition to which, the greater part of the watermen,\r\nfearing to be forced to pass soldiers or baggage, had taken refuge with\r\ntheir boats on the opposite shore; the few barks that remained were\r\nalready filled with people, and endangered by the weather. It was\r\nimpossible to find a carriage or horse, or any mode of conveyance. Don\r\nAbbondio did not dare venture on foot, incurring, as he would, the\r\nprobability of being stopped on the road. The confines of the\r\nBergamascan territory were not so distant, but that he could have walked\r\nthere in a little while; but a report had reached the village, that a\r\nsquadron of _cappelletri_ had been sent in haste from Bergamo, to guard\r\nthe frontiers against the German foot-soldiers. These were not less\r\ndevils incarnate than those they were commissioned to oppose. The poor\r\nman was beside himself with terror; he endeavoured to concert with\r\nPerpetua some plan of escape, but Perpetua was quite occupied in\r\ncollecting and concealing his valuables; with her hands full, she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me place this in safety; we will then do as other people\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d Don Abbondio desired eagerly to discuss with her the best means to\r\nbe pursued, but Perpetua, between hurry and fright, was less tractable\r\nthan usual: \xe2\x80\x9cOthers will do the best they can,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand so will\r\nwe. Excuse me, but you only hinder one. Do you not think they have skins\r\nto save as well as we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRelieving herself thus from his importunities, she went on with her\r\noccupation; the poor man, as a last resource, went to a window, and\r\ncried, in a piteous tone, to the people who were passing, \xe2\x80\x9cDo your poor\r\ncurate the favour to bring him a horse or a mule; is it possible no one\r\nwill come to help me? Wait for me at least; wait till I can go with you;\r\nabandon me not. Would you leave me in the power of these dogs? Know you\r\nnot that they are Lutherans, and that the murder of a priest will seem\r\nto them a meritorious deed? Would you leave me here to be martyred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to whom did he address this appeal? to men who were themselves\r\nincumbered with the weight of their humble movables, or, disturbed by\r\nthe thoughts of what they had been obliged to leave behind, exposed to\r\nthe ravages of the destroyer. One drove his cow before him; another\r\nconducted his children, who were also laden with burdens, his wife\r\nperhaps with an infant in her arms. Some went on their way without\r\nreplying or looking at him; others merely said, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, sir, do as you can;\r\nyou are fortunate in having no family to think of; help yourself; do the\r\nbest you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9coh, what savages! they have no\r\nfeeling; they give not a thought to their poor curate!\xe2\x80\x9d And he went\r\nagain in search of Perpetua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are come just in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is your money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me; I will bury it in the garden with the plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, but, give it to me; keep a few pence for necessity, and let me\r\nmanage the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio obeyed, and drawing his treasure from his strong box, gave\r\nit to Perpetua. \xe2\x80\x9cI will bury it in the garden, at the foot of the\r\nfig-tree,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she disappeared. She returned in a few moments,\r\nwith a large basket, full of provisions, and a small one, which was\r\nempty; into the latter she put a few articles of clothing for herself\r\nand master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take your breviary with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere every one else goes. We will go into the street, and then we\r\nshall hear and see what we must do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Agnes entered with a small basket in her hand, and with\r\nthe air of one about to make an important proposal.\r\n\r\nShe had decided not to wait the approach of the dangerous guests, alone\r\nas she was, and with the gold of the Unknown in her possession; but had\r\nremained some time in doubt where to seek an asylum. The residue of the\r\ncrowns, which in time of famine would have been so great a treasure, was\r\nnow the principal cause of her anxiety and irresolution; as, under the\r\npresent circumstances, those who had money were worse off than others;\r\nbeing exposed at the same time to the violence of strangers, and the\r\ntreachery of their companions. It is true, none knew of the wealth which\r\nhad thus, as it were, fallen to her from heaven, except Don Abbondio, to\r\nwhom she had often applied to change a crown, leaving him always some\r\npart of it for those more unfortunate than herself. But hidden\r\nproperty, above all, to those not accustomed to such a possession, keeps\r\nthe possessor in continual suspicion of others. Now, whilst she\r\nreflected on the peculiar dangers to which she was exposed, by the very\r\ngenerosity itself of the Unknown, the offer of unlimited service, which\r\nhad accompanied the gift, suddenly occurred to her recollection. She\r\nremembered the descriptions she had heard of his castle, as situated in\r\na high place, where, without the concurrence of the master, none dared\r\nventure but the birds of heaven. Resolving to go thither, and reflecting\r\non the means of making herself known to this signor, her thoughts\r\nrecurred to Don Abbondio, who, since the conversation with the\r\narchbishop, had been very particular in his expression of good feeling\r\ntowards her, as he could at present be, without compromising himself,\r\nthere being but little probability, from the situation of affairs, that\r\nhis benevolence would be put to the test. She naturally supposed, that\r\nin a time of such consternation, the poor man would be more alarmed than\r\nherself, and might acquiesce in her plan; this was, therefore, the\r\npurpose of her visit. Finding him alone with Perpetua, she made known\r\nher intentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to it, Perpetua?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that it is an inspiration from Heaven, and that we must lose no\r\ntime, and set off immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, but then; when we have arrived safely there, we shall be very\r\nglad, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. It is well known that this signor thinks of nothing\r\nnow but doing good to others, and he will afford us an asylum with the\r\ngreatest pleasure. There, on the frontiers, and almost in the sky, the\r\nsoldiers will not trouble us. But then\xe2\x80\x94but then, we shall have enough\r\nto eat, no doubt. On the top of the mountains, the provisions we have\r\nhere with us would not serve us long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that he is really converted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you doubt it, after all you have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if, after all, we should be voluntarily placing ourselves in\r\nprison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat prison? With this trifling, excuse me, we shall never come to any\r\nconclusion. Worthy Agnes! your plan is an excellent one.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, she\r\nplaced the basket on the table, and having passed her arms through the\r\nstraps, swung it over her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould we not procure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9csome man to accompany us?\r\nShould we encounter some ruffian on the way, what assistance would you\r\nbe to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot done yet! always losing time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perpetua. \xe2\x80\x9cGo then, and look\r\nfor a man, and you will find every one engaged in his own business, I\r\nwarrant you. Come, take your breviary, and your hat, and let us be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio was obliged to obey, and they departed. They passed through\r\na small door into the churchyard. Perpetua closed it from custom; not\r\nfor the security it could now give. Don Abbondio cast a look towards the\r\nchurch,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for the people to guard it,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; \xe2\x80\x9cit is their\r\nchurch: let them see to it, if they have the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d They took the\r\nby-paths through the fields, but were in continual apprehension of\r\nencountering some one, who might arrest their progress. They met no one,\r\nhowever; all were employed, either in guarding their houses, or packing\r\ntheir furniture, or travelling, with their moveables, towards the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio, after many sighs and interjections, began to grumble\r\naloud: he complained of the Duke of Nevers, who could have remained to\r\nenjoy himself in France, had he not been determined to be Duke of\r\nMantua, in despite of all the world; of the emperor, and above all, of\r\nthe governor, whose duty it was to keep this scourge from the country,\r\nand not invoke it by his taste for war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet these people be, they cannot help us now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nare your usual chatterings, excuse me, which mean nothing. That which\r\ngives me the most uneasiness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerpetua, who had been leisurely recalling to mind the things which she\r\nhad so hastily concealed, remembered that she had forgotten such an\r\narticle, and had not safely deposited such another; that she had left\r\ntraces which might impart information to the depredators.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio, in whom the security he was beginning\r\nto feel with regard to his life allowed his anxiety to appear for his\r\nproperty; \xe2\x80\x9cwell done! Is this what you have been doing? Where were your\r\nbrains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Perpetua, stopping for a moment, and attempting, as far\r\nas her load would permit, to place her arms a-kimbo; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you find fault,\r\nwhen it was yourself who teased me out of my wits, instead of helping me\r\nas you ought to have done? I have thought more of my master\xe2\x80\x99s goods than\r\nmy own; and if there is any thing lost, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, I have done\r\nmore than my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgnes interrupted these disputes by introducing her own troubles: she\r\nwas obliged to relinquish the hope of seeing her dear Lucy, for some\r\ntime at least; for she could not expect that Donna Prassede would come\r\ninto this vicinity under such circumstances. The sight of the\r\nwell-remembered places through which they were passing increased the\r\nanguish of her feelings. Leaving the fields, they had taken the high\r\nroad, the same which the poor woman had travelled, in re-conducting, for\r\nso short a time, her daughter to her home, after having been with her at\r\nthe tailor\xe2\x80\x99s. As they approached the village, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and visit these\r\nworthy people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd rest a little, and eat a mouthful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I begin to\r\nhave enough of this basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn condition that we lose no time, for this is not by any means a\r\njourney for amusement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\nThey were received with open arms, and cordially welcomed; Agnes,\r\nembracing the good hostess, wept bitterly; replying with sobs to the\r\nquestions her husband and she asked concerning Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is better off than we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is at Milan,\r\nsheltered from danger, far from these horrible scenes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signor curate and his companions are fugitives, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe tailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied, at the same time, Perpetua and her master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sympathise with your misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to the castle of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well thought of; you will be as safe as in Paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you not afraid here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are too much off the road. If they should turn out of their way, we\r\nshall be warned in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three travellers decided to take a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest: as it was the\r\nhour of dinner, \xe2\x80\x9cDo me the honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x9cto partake of my\r\nhumble fare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerpetua said she had provisions enough in her basket wherewith to break\r\nher fast; after a little ceremony, however, on both sides, they agreed\r\nto seat themselves at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nThe children had joyfully surrounded their old friend Agnes; the tailor\r\nordered one of them to roast some early chestnuts; \xe2\x80\x9cand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\r\nanother, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the garden, and bring some peaches; all that are ripe.\r\nAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d to a third, \xe2\x80\x9cclimb the fig-tree, and gather the best figs; it\r\nis a business to which you are well accustomed.\xe2\x80\x9d As for himself, he left\r\nthe room to tap a small cask of wine, while his wife went in search of a\r\ntable-cloth. All being prepared, they seated themselves at the friendly\r\nboard, if not with unmingled joy, at least with much more satisfaction\r\nthan they could have anticipated from the events of the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the signor curate say to the disasters of the times? I can\r\nfancy I\xe2\x80\x99m reading the history of the Moors in France,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I say? That even that misfortune might have befallen me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have chosen an excellent asylum, however; for none can ascend those\r\nheights without the consent of the master. You will find a numerous\r\ncompany there. Many people have already fled thither, and there are\r\nfresh arrivals every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare to hope we shall be well received. I know this worthy signor:\r\nwhen I had the honour to be in his company he was all politeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9che sent me word by his illustrious lordship, that if\r\never I should need assistance, I had only to apply to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wonderful conversion!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he perseveres?\r\ndoes he _not_ persevere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tailor spoke at length of the holy life of the Unknown, and said,\r\nthat after having been the scourge of the country, he had become its\r\nbest example and benefactor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the people of his household\xe2\x80\x94that band?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Abbondio, who\r\nhad heard some contradictory stories concerning them, and did not feel,\r\ntherefore, quite secure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greater part have left him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand those who\r\nhave remained have changed their manner of life; in short, this castle\r\nhas become like the Thebaid. The signor curate understands me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen retracing with Agnes the visit of the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a great man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9ca great man, indeed! what a pity he remained so short a time\r\nwith us! I wished to do him honour. Oh, if I had only been able to\r\naddress him again, more at my leisure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they rose from table, he showed them an engraving of the cardinal,\r\nwhich he had hung on the door, from veneration to his virtues, and also\r\nto enable him to assure every body that it was no likeness; he knew it\r\nwas not, as he had regarded him closely at his leisure in this very\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they mean that for him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe habit is the same,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no likeness, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what I always say,\r\nbut other things being wanting, there is at least his name under it,\r\nwhich tells who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio being impatient to be gone, the tailor went in search of a\r\nvehicle to carry the little company to the foot of the ascent, and\r\nreturned in a few moments to inform them it was ready. \xe2\x80\x9cSignor curate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wish a few books to carry with you, I can lend you\r\nsome; for I amuse myself sometimes with reading. They are not like\r\nyours, to be sure, being in the vulgar tongue, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand thanks, but under present circumstances I have scarcely\r\nbrains enough to read my breviary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter an exchange of thanks, invitations, and promises, they bade\r\nfarewell, and pursued, with a little more tranquillity of mind, the\r\nremainder of their journey.\r\n\r\nThe tailor had told Don Abbondio the truth, with regard to the new life\r\nof the Unknown. From the day that we took our leave of him, he had\r\ncontinued to put in practice his good intentions, by repairing injuries,\r\nreconciling himself with his enemies, and succouring the distressed and\r\nunfortunate. The courage he had formerly evinced in attack and defence\r\nhe now employed in avoiding all occasion both for the one and the other.\r\nHe went unarmed and alone; disposed to suffer the possible consequences\r\nof the violences he had committed; persuaded that it would be adding to\r\nhis crimes to employ any methods of defence for himself, as he was a\r\ndebtor to all the world; and persuaded also, that though the evil done\r\nto him would be sin against God, it would be but a just retribution\r\nagainst himself; and that he had left himself no right to revenge an\r\ninjury, however unprovoked it might be at the time. But he was not less\r\ninviolable than when he bore arms to insure his safety; the recollection\r\nof his former ferocity, and the contrast of his present gentleness, the\r\nformer exciting a desire of revenge, and the latter rendering this\r\nrevenge so easy, conspired to subdue hatred, and, in its place, to\r\nsubstitute an admiration which served him as a safeguard. The man whom\r\nno one could humble, but who had humbled himself, was regarded with the\r\ndeepest veneration. Those whom he had wronged had obtained, beyond their\r\nhopes, and without incurring any danger, a satisfaction which they could\r\nnever have promised themselves from the most complete revenge, the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing him repent of his wrongs, and participate, so to\r\nspeak, in their indignation. In his voluntary abasement, his countenance\r\nand manner had acquired, without his own knowledge, something elevated\r\nand noble; his outward demeanour was as dauntless as ever.\r\n\r\nThis change, also, in addition to other reasons, secured him from public\r\nretribution at the instigation of those in authority. His rank and\r\nfamily, which had always been a species of defence to him, still\r\nprevailed in his favour; and to his name, already famous, was joined the\r\npersonal esteem which was now due to him. The magistrates and nobility\r\nhad rejoiced at his conversion, as well as the people; as this\r\nconversion produced compensations that they were neither accustomed to\r\nask nor obtain. Probably, also, the name of the Cardinal Frederick,\r\nwhose interest in his conversion, and subsequent friendship for him,\r\nwere well known, served him as an impenetrable shield.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the German troops, when fugitives from the invaded\r\ncountries fled to the castle, delighted that his walls, so long the\r\nobject of dread and execration to the feeble, should now be regarded as\r\na place of security and protection, the Unknown received them rather\r\nwith gratitude than politeness. He caused it to be made public, that his\r\ndoors would be open to all, and employed himself immediately in placing\r\nnot only the castle but the valley beneath in a state of defence:\r\nassembling the servants who had remained with him, he addressed them on\r\nthe opportunity God had afforded them, as well as himself, to serve\r\nthose whom they had so frequently oppressed and terrified. With his old\r\naccent of command, expressing the certainty of being obeyed, he gave\r\nthem general orders, as to their deportment, so that those who should\r\ntake refuge with him might behold in them only defenders and friends. He\r\ngave their arms to them again, of which they had been deprived; as also\r\nto the peasants of the valley, who were willing to engage in its\r\ndefence: he named officers, and appointed to them their duty and their\r\ndifferent stations, as he had been accustomed to do in his former\r\ncriminal life. He himself, however, whether from principle, or that he\r\nhad made a vow to that effect, remained unarmed at the head of his\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nHe also employed the females of the household in preparing beds, straw,\r\nmattresses, sacks, in various rooms intended as temporary dormitories.\r\nHe ordered abundant provisions to be brought to the castle for the use\r\nof the guests God should send him; and in the mean while he was himself\r\nnever idle, visiting every post, examining every defence, and\r\nmaintaining the most perfect order by his authority and his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our fugitives approached the valley, they were joined by many\r\ncompanions in misfortune, who were on the same errand to the castle with\r\nthemselves: under similar circumstances of distress and anguish,\r\nintimacies are soon matured, and they listened to the relation of each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s peril with mutual interest and sympathy; some had fled, like the\r\ncurate and our females, without waiting the arrival of the troops;\r\nothers had actually seen them, and could describe, in lively colours,\r\ntheir savage and horrible appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are fortunate, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9clet us thank Heaven. We may\r\nlose our property, but at least our lives are safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Don Abbondio could not see so much reason for congratulation; the\r\ngreat concourse of people suggested new causes of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nhe to the females when no one was near enough to hear him; \xe2\x80\x9coh, do you\r\nnot perceive that by assembling here in such crowds we shall attract the\r\nnotice of the soldiery? As every one flies and no one remains at home,\r\nthey will believe that our treasures are up here, and this belief will\r\nlead them hither. Oh, poor me! why was I so thoughtless as to venture\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should they come here for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are obliged to\r\npursue their route; and, at all events, where there is danger, it is\r\nbest to have plenty of company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompany, company, silly woman! don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that every lansquenet\r\ncould devour a hundred of them? and then, if any of them should commit\r\nsome foolish violence, it would be a fine thing to find ourselves in the\r\nmidst of a battle! It would have been better to have gone to the\r\nmountains. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why they have all been seized with a mania to go\r\nto one place. Curse the people! all here; one after the other, like a\r\nfrightened flock of sheep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cthey may say the same of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush! it is of no use to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9cthat which is\r\ndone, _is_ done: we are here, and here we must remain. May Heaven\r\nprotect us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his anxiety was much increased by the appearance of a number of\r\narmed men at the entrance of the valley. It is impossible to describe\r\nhis vexation and alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; \xe2\x80\x9cI might have\r\nexpected this from a man of his character. What does he mean to do? Will\r\nhe declare war? Will he act the part of a sovereign? Oh, poor me! poor\r\nme! In this terrible conjuncture he ought to have concealed himself as\r\nmuch as possible; and, behold, he seeks every method to make himself\r\nknown. It is easy to be seen he wants to provoke them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not see, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these are brave men who are\r\nable to defend us? Let the soldiers come; these men are not at all like\r\nour poor devils of peasants, who are good for nothing but to use their\r\nlegs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Don Abbondio, in a low but angry tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbe quiet;\r\nyou know not what you say. Pray Heaven that the army may be in haste to\r\nproceed on its march, so that they may not gain information of this\r\nplace being disposed like a garrison. They would ask for nothing better;\r\nan assault is mere play to them, and putting every one to the sword like\r\ngoing to a wedding. Oh, poor me! perhaps I can secure a place of safety\r\non one of these precipices. I will never be taken in battle! I will\r\nnever be taken in battle! I never will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are even afraid of being defended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d returned Perpetua; but\r\nDon Abbondio sharply interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, and take care not to relate this conversation. Remember you\r\nmust always keep a pleasant countenance here, and appear to approve all\r\nthat you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Malanotte they found another company of armed men. Don Abbondio took\r\noff his hat and bowed profoundly, saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAlas, alas! I am\r\nreally in a camp.\xe2\x80\x9d They here quitted the carriage to ascend the pass on\r\nfoot, the curate having in haste paid and dismissed the driver. The\r\nrecollection of his former terrors in this very place increased his\r\npresent forebodings of evil, by mingling themselves with his\r\nreflections, and enfeebling more and more his understanding. Agnes, who\r\nhad never before trod this path, but who had often pictured it to her\r\nimagination, was filled with different but keenly painful remembrances.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, signor curate,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I think how my poor Lucy passed\r\nthis very road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be quiet, foolish woman?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio in her ear. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nthese things to speak of in this place? Are you ignorant that we are on\r\nhis lands? It is fortunate no one heard you. If you speak in this\r\nmanner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that he is a saint\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Don Abbondio: \xe2\x80\x9cthink you we can tell the saints all\r\nthat passes through our brains? Think rather of thanking him for the\r\nkindness he has done you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that I have already thought of it; do you think I have no\r\nmanners, no politeness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoliteness, my good woman, does not consist in telling people things\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear. Have a little discretion, I pray you. Weigh\r\nwell your words, speak but little, and that only when it is\r\nindispensable. There is no danger in silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do much worse with all your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Perpetua. But \xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Abbondio, and, taking off his hat, he bowed profoundly. The Unknown\r\nwas coming to meet them, having recognised the curate approaching. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncould have wished,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto offer you my house on a more agreeable\r\noccasion; but, under any circumstances, I esteem myself happy in serving\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfiding in the great kindness of your illustrious lordship, I have\r\ntaken the liberty to trouble you at this unhappy time; and, as your\r\nillustrious lordship sees, I have also taken the liberty to bring\r\ncompany with me. This is my housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is a female to whom your lordship has already rendered great\r\nbenefits. The mother of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Lucy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Unknown, turning to Agnes; \xe2\x80\x9crendered benefits! I!\r\nJust God! It is you who render benefits to me by coming hither; to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94to this dwelling. You are very welcome. You bring with you the\r\nblessing of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I come rather to give you trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d Approaching him nearer, she\r\nsaid, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have to thank you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Unknown interrupted her, asking with much interest concerning Lucy.\r\nHe then conducted his new guests to the castle. Agnes looked at the\r\ncurate, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cSee if there is any need of your interfering\r\nbetween us with your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the army arrived in your parish?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Unknown to Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord, I would not wait for the demons. Heaven knows if I should\r\nhave escaped alive from their hands, and been able to trouble your\r\nillustrious lordship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be quite at ease; you are now in safety; they will not come\r\nhere. If the whim should seize them, we are ready to receive them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope they will not come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd on that side,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded he, pointing to the opposite mountains, \xe2\x80\x9con that side, also,\r\nwanders another body of troops; but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. But, doubt not, we are ready for them also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween two fires!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio, \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely between two fires!\r\nWhere have I suffered myself to be led? And by two women! And this lord\r\nappears to delight in such business! Oh, what people there are in the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the castle, the Unknown ordered Agnes and Perpetua to\r\nbe conducted to a room, in the quarter assigned to the women, which was\r\nthree of the four wings of the second court, in the most retired part of\r\nthe edifice. The men were accommodated in the wings of the other court\r\nto the right and left; the body of the building was filled, partly with\r\nprovisions, and partly with the effects that the refugees brought with\r\nthem. In the quarter devoted to the men was a small apartment destined\r\nto the ecclesiastics who might arrive. The Unknown accompanied Don\r\nAbbondio thither, who was the first to take possession of it.\r\n\r\nOur fugitives remained three or four and twenty days in the castle, in\r\nthe midst of continual bustle and alarm. Not a day passed without some\r\nreports; at each account, the Unknown, unarmed as he was, led his band\r\nbeyond the precincts of the valley to ascertain the extent of the peril;\r\nit was a singular thing, indeed, to behold him, without any personal\r\ndefence, conducting a body of armed men.\r\n\r\nNot to encroach too far on the benevolence of the Unknown, Agnes and\r\nPerpetua employed themselves in performing services in the household.\r\nThese occupations, with occasional conversations with the acquaintances\r\nthey had formed at the castle, enabled them to pass away the time with\r\nless weariness. Poor Don Abbondio, who had nothing to do, was\r\nnotwithstanding prevented from becoming listless and inactive by his\r\nfears: as to the dread of an attack, it was in some measure dissipated,\r\nbut still the idea of the surrounding country, occupied on every side by\r\nsoldiers, and of the numerous consequences which might at any moment\r\nresult from such a state, kept him in perpetual alarm.\r\n\r\nAll the time he remained in this asylum he never thought of going beyond\r\nthe defences; his only walk was on the esplanade; he surveyed every\r\nside of the castle, observing attentively the hollows and precipices, to\r\nascertain if there were any practicable passage by which he might seek\r\nescape in case of imminent danger. Every day there were various reports\r\nof the march of the soldiers; some newsmongers by profession gathered\r\ngreedily all these reports, and spread them among their companions. On\r\nsuch a day, such a regiment arrived in such a territory; the next day\r\nthey would ravage such another, where, in the mean time, another\r\ndetachment had been plundering before them. An account was kept of the\r\nregiments that passed the bridge of Lecco, as they were then considered\r\nfairly out of the country. The cavalry of Wallenstein passed, then the\r\ninfantry of Marrados, then the cavalry of Anzalt, then the infantry of\r\nBrandenburgh, and, finally, that of Galasso. The flying squadron of\r\nVenetians also removed, and the country was again free from invaders.\r\nAlready the inhabitants of the different villages had begun to quit the\r\ncastle; some departed every day, as after an autumn storm the birds of\r\nheaven leave the leafy branches of a great tree, under whose shelter\r\nthey had sought and obtained protection. Our three friends were the last\r\nto depart, as Don Abbondio feared, if he returned so soon to his house,\r\nto find there some loitering soldiers. Perpetua in vain repeated, that\r\nthe longer they delayed, the greater opportunity they afforded to the\r\nthieves of the country to take possession of all that might have been\r\nleft by the spoilers.\r\n\r\nOn the day fixed for their departure, the Unknown had a carriage ready\r\nat Malanotte, and, taking Agnes aside, he made her accept a bag of\r\ncrowns, to repair the damage she would find at home; although she\r\nprotested she was in no need of them, having still some of those he had\r\nformerly sent her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see your good Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9c(I am certain that she prays\r\nfor me, as I have done her much evil,) tell her that I thank her, and\r\nthat I trust in God that her prayer will return in blessings on\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey finally departed; they stopped for a few moments at the house of\r\nthe tailor, where they heard sad relations of this terrible march,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nusual story of violence and plunder. The tailor\xe2\x80\x99s family, however, had\r\nremained unmolested, as the army did not pass that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, signor curate!\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, as he was bidding him farewell,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is a fine subject to appear in print!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter having proceeded a short distance, our travellers beheld\r\nmelancholy traces of the destruction they had heard related. Vineyards\r\ndespoiled, not by the vintager, but as if by a tempest; vines trampled\r\nunder foot; trees wounded and lopped of their branches; hedges\r\ndestroyed; in the villages, doors broken open, window-frames dashed in,\r\nand streets filled with different articles of furniture and clothing,\r\nbroken and torn to pieces. In the midst of lamentations and tears, the\r\npeasants were occupied in repairing, as well as they could, the damage\r\ndone; while others, overcome by their miseries, remained in a state of\r\nsilent despair. Having passed through these scenes of complicated woe,\r\nthey at last succeeded in reaching their own dwellings, where they\r\nwitnessed the same destruction. Agnes immediately occupied herself in\r\nreducing to order the little furniture that was left her, and in\r\nrepairing the damage done to her doors and windows; but she did not\r\nforget to count over in secret her crowns, thanking God in her heart,\r\nand her generous benefactor, that in the general overthrow of order and\r\nsafety she at least had fallen on her feet.\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio and Perpetua entered their house without being obliged to\r\nhave recourse to keys. In addition to the miserable destruction of all\r\ntheir furniture, whose various fragments impeded their entrance, the\r\nmost horrible odours for a time drove them back; and when these\r\nobstacles were at last surmounted, and the rooms were entered, they\r\nfound indignity added to mischief. Frightful and grotesque figures of\r\npriests, with their square caps and bands, were drawn with pieces of\r\ncoal upon the walls in all sorts of ridiculous attitudes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the hogs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perpetua.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don\r\nAbbondio. Hastening into the garden, they approached the fig-tree, and\r\nbeheld the earth newly turned up, and, to their utter dismay, the tomb\r\nwas opened, and the dead was gone. Don Abbondio scolded Perpetua for her\r\nbad management, who was not slack in repelling his complaints. Both\r\npointing backwards to the unlucky hiding place, at length returned to\r\nthe house, and set about endeavouring to purify it of some of its\r\naccumulated filth, as at such a time it was impossible to procure\r\nassistance for the purpose. With money lent them by Agnes, they were in\r\nsome measure enabled to replace their articles of furniture.\r\n\r\nFor some time this disaster was the source of continual disputes between\r\nPerpetua and her master; the former having discovered that some of the\r\nproperty, which they supposed to have been taken by the soldiers, was\r\nactually in possession of certain people of the village, she tormented\r\nhim incessantly to claim it. There could not have been touched a chord\r\nmore hateful to Don Abbondio, since the property was in the hands of\r\nthat class of persons with whom he had it most at heart to live in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to know these things,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many times must I\r\ntell you that what has happened has? Must I get myself into trouble\r\nagain, because my house has been robbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would suffer your eyes to be pulled from your head, I verily\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perpetua; \xe2\x80\x9cothers hate to be robbed, but you, you seem to\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty language to hold, indeed! Will you be quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerpetua kept silence, but continually found new pretexts for resuming\r\nthe conversation; so that the poor man was obliged to suppress every\r\ncomplaint at the loss of such or such a thing, as she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cGo and\r\nfind it at such a person\xe2\x80\x99s house, who has it, and who would not have\r\nkept it until now if he had not known what kind of a man he had to deal\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut here we will leave poor Don Abbondio, having more important things\r\nto speak of than his fears, or the misery of a few villagers from a\r\ntransient disaster like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pestilence, as the Tribunal of Health had feared, did enter the\r\nMilanese with the German troops. It is also known that it was not\r\nlimited to that territory, but that it spread over and desolated a great\r\npart of Italy. Our story requires us, at present, to relate the\r\nprincipal circumstances of this great calamity, as far as it affected\r\nthe Milanese, and principally the city of Milan itself, for the\r\nchroniclers of the period confine their relations chiefly to this place.\r\nAt the same time we cannot avoid giving a general though brief sketch of\r\nan event in the history of our country more talked of than understood.\r\n\r\nMany partial narratives written at the time are still extant; but these\r\nconvey but an imperfect view of the subject, historically speaking. It\r\nis true they serve to illustrate and confirm one another, and furnish\r\nmaterials for a history; but the history is still wanting. Strange to\r\nsay, no writer has hitherto attempted to reduce them to order, and\r\nexhibit all the various events, public and private acts, causes and\r\nconjectures, relative to this calamity, in a concatenated series.\r\nRipamonti\xe2\x80\x99s narrative, though far more ample than any other, is still\r\nvery defective. We shall, therefore, attempt, in the following pages, to\r\npresent the reader with a succinct, but accurate and continuous,\r\nstatement of this fatal scourge.\r\n\r\nIn all the line of country which had been over-run by the army, dead\r\nbodies had been found in the houses, as well as on the roads. Soon\r\nafter, throughout the whole country, entire families were attacked with\r\nviolent disorders, accompanied with unusual symptoms, which the aged\r\nonly remembered to have seen at the time of the plague, which,\r\nfifty-three years before, had desolated a great part of Italy, and\r\nprincipally the Milanese, where it was and still is known by the name of\r\nthe Plague of San Carlo. It derives this appellation from the noble,\r\nbeneficent, and disinterested conduct of that great man, who at length\r\nbecame its victim.\r\n\r\nLudovico Settala, a physician distinguished so long ago as during the\r\nformer plague, announced to the Tribunal of Health, by the 20th of\r\nOctober, that the contagion had indisputably appeared at Lecco; but no\r\nmeasures were taken upon this report. Further notices of a like import\r\ninduced them to despatch a commissioner, with a physician of Como, who,\r\nmost unaccountably, upon the report of an old barber of Bellano,\r\nannounced that the prevailing disease arose merely from the autumnal\r\nexhalation from the marshes, aggravated by the sufferings caused by the\r\npassage of the German troops.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, further intelligence of the new disease, and of the number of\r\ndeaths, arriving from all parts, two commissioners were sent to examine\r\nthe places where it had appeared, and, if necessary, to use precautions\r\nto prevent its increase. The scourge had already spread to such an\r\nextent, as to leave no doubt of its character. The commissioners passed\r\nthrough the territories of Lecco, the borders of the lake of Como, the\r\ndistricts of Monte-Brianza, and Gera-d\xe2\x80\x99Adda, and found the villages\r\nevery where in a state of barricade, or deserted, and the inhabitants\r\nflying, or encamped in the middle of the fields, or dispersed abroad\r\nthroughout the country; \xe2\x80\x9clike so many wild creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d says Doctor\r\nTadino, one of the envoys, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were carrying about them some imaginary\r\nsafeguard against the dreaded disease, such as sprigs of mint, rue, or\r\nrosemary, and even vinegar.\xe2\x80\x9d Informing themselves of the number of\r\ndeaths, the commissioners became alarmed, and visiting the sick and the\r\ndead, recognised the terrible and infallible evidences of the _plague_!\r\n\r\nUpon this information, orders were given to close the gates of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal of Health, on the 14th of November, directed the\r\ncommissioners to wait on the governor, in order to represent to him the\r\nsituation of affairs. He replied, that he was very sorry for it; but\r\nthat the cares of war were much more pressing: this was the second time\r\nhe had made the same answer under similar circumstances. Two or three\r\ndays after, he published a decree, prescribing public rejoicings on the\r\nbirth of Prince Charles, the first son of Philip IV., without troubling\r\nhimself with the danger which would result from so great a concourse of\r\npeople at such a time; just as if things were going on in their ordinary\r\ncourse, and no dreadful evil was hanging over them.\r\n\r\nThis man was the celebrated Ambrose Spinola, who died a few months\r\nafter, and during this very war which he had so much at heart,\xe2\x80\x94not in\r\nthe field, but in his bed, and through grief and vexation at the\r\ntreatment he experienced from those whose interests he had served.\r\nHistory has loudly extolled his merits; she has been silent upon his\r\nbase inhumanity in risking the dissemination of that worst of mortal\r\ncalamities, plague, over a country committed to his trust.\r\n\r\nBut that which diminishes our astonishment at his indifference is the\r\nindifference of the people themselves, of that part of the population\r\nwhich the contagion had not yet reached, but who had so many motives to\r\ndread it. The scarcity of the preceding year, the exactions of the army,\r\nand the anxiety of mind which had been endured, appeared to them more\r\nthan sufficient to explain the mortality of the surrounding country.\r\nThey heard with a smile of incredulity and contempt any who hazarded a\r\nword on the danger, or who even mentioned the plague. The same\r\nincredulity, the same blindness, the same obstinacy, prevailed in the\r\nsenate, the council of ten, and in all the judicial bodies. Cardinal\r\nFrederick alone enjoined his curates to impress upon the people the\r\nimportance of declaring every case, and of sequestrating all infected or\r\nsuspected goods. The Tribunal of Health, prompted by the two physicians,\r\nwho fully apprehended the danger, did take some tardy measures; but in\r\nvain. A proclamation to prevent the entrance of strangers into the city\r\nwas not published until the 29th of November. This was too late; the\r\nplague was already in Milan.\r\n\r\nIt must be difficult, however interesting, to discover the first cause\r\nof a calamity which swept off so many thousands of the inhabitants of\r\nthe city; but both Tadino and Ripamonti agree that it was brought\r\nthither by an Italian soldier in the service of Spain, who had either\r\nbought or stolen a quantity of clothes from the German soldiers. He was\r\non a visit to his parents in Milan, when he fell sick, and, being\r\ncarried to the hospital, died on the fourth day.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal of Health condemned the house he had lived in; his clothes\r\nand the bed he had occupied in the hospital were consigned to the\r\nflames. Two servants and a good friar, who had attended him, fell sick a\r\nfew days after; but the suspicions from the first entertained of the\r\nnature of the malady, and the precautions used, prevented its extension\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nBut in the house from which the soldier had been taken there were\r\nseveral attacked by the disease; upon which all the inhabitants of it\r\nwere conducted to the lazaretto, by order of the Tribunal of Health.\r\n\r\nThe contagion made but little progress during the rest of this year and\r\nthe beginning of the following. From time to time there were a few\r\npersons attacked, but the rarity of the occurrence diminished the\r\nsuspicion of the plague, and confirmed the multitude in their disbelief\r\nof its existence. Added to this, most of the physicians joined with the\r\npeople in laughing at the unhappy presages and threatening opinions of\r\nthe smaller number of their brethren: the cases that did occur they\r\npretended to explain upon other grounds; and the account of these cases\r\nwas seldom presented to the Tribunal of Health. Fear of the lazaretto\r\nkept all on the alert; the sick were concealed, and false certificates\r\nwere obtained from some subaltern officers of health, who were deputed\r\nto inspect the dead bodies. Those physicians, who, convinced of the\r\nreality of the contagion, proposed precautions against it, were the\r\nobjects of general animadversion. But the principal objects of\r\nexecration were Tadino and the senator Settala, who were stigmatised as\r\nenemies of their country, men whose best exertions had been directed\r\ntowards mitigating the severity of the coming mischief. Even the\r\nillustrious Settala, the aged father of the senator, whose talents were\r\nequalled by his benevolence, was obliged to take refuge in a friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse from the popular fury, because he had constantly urged the\r\nnecessity of precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month of March, at first in the suburb of the\r\neastern gate, then in the rest of the city, deaths, attended by singular\r\nsymptoms, such as spasms, delirium, livid spots and buboes, began to be\r\nmore frequent. Sudden deaths, too, were frequent, without any previous\r\nillness. The physicians still perversely held out; but the magistracy\r\nwere aroused. The Tribunal of Health called on them to enforce their\r\ndirections; to raise the requisite funds for the growing expenses of the\r\nlazaretto, as well as the helpless poor. The malady advanced rapidly. In\r\nthe lazaretto all was confusion, bad arrangement, and anarchy. In their\r\ndifficulty on this point the Tribunal had recourse to the capuchins, and\r\nconjured the father provincial to give them a man capable of governing\r\nthis region of desolation. He offered them Father Felice Casati, who\r\nenjoyed a high reputation for charity, activity, and kindness of\r\ndisposition, added to great strength of mind, and as a companion to him,\r\nFather Michele Pozzobonelli, who, although young, was of a grave and\r\nthoughtful character. They were joyfully accepted, and on the 30th of\r\nMarch they entered on their duties. As the crowd in the lazaretto\r\nincreased, other capuchins joined them, willingly performing every\r\noffice both of spiritual and of temporal kindness, even the most menial;\r\nthe Father Felice, indefatigable in his labours, watched with unceasing\r\nand parental care over the multitude. He caught the plague, was cured,\r\nand resumed his duties even with greater alacrity. Most of his brethren\r\njoyfully sacrificed their lives in this cause of afflicted humanity.\r\n\r\nNot being able longer to deny the terrible effects of the malady, which\r\nhad now reached the family of the physician Settala, and was spreading\r\nits ravages in many noble families, those medical men who had been\r\nincredulous were still unwilling to acknowledge its true cause, which\r\nwould have been a tacit condemnation of themselves; they therefore\r\nimagined one entirely conformable to the prejudices of the time. It was\r\nat that period a prevailing opinion in all Europe, that enchanters\r\nexisted, diabolical operators, who at this time conspired to spread the\r\nplague, by the aid of venomous poisons and witchcraft. Similar things\r\nhad been affirmed and believed in other epidemics; particularly at\r\nMilan, in that of the preceding century. Moreover, towards the end of\r\nthe preceding year, a despatch had arrived from King Philip IV. giving\r\ninformation that four Frenchmen, suspected of spreading poisons and\r\npestilential substances, had escaped from Madrid, and ordering that\r\nwatch should be kept to ascertain if by chance they had arrived at\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nThe governor communicated the despatch to the senate, and the Tribunal\r\nof Health. It then excited no attention; but when the plague broke out,\r\nand was acknowledged by all, this intelligence was remembered, and it\r\nserved to confirm the vague suspicion of criminal agency: two incidents\r\nconverted this vague suspicion into conviction of a positive and real\r\nconspiracy. Some persons who imagined they saw, on the evening of the\r\n17th of May, individuals rubbing a partition of the cathedral, carried\r\nthe partition out of the church in the night, together with a great\r\nquantity of benches. The president of the senate, with four persons of\r\nhis tribunal, visited the partition, the benches, and the basins of holy\r\nwater, and found nothing which confirmed the ridiculous suspicion of\r\npoison. However, to satisfy the disturbed imaginations of the populace,\r\nit was decided that the partition should be washed and purified. But the\r\nincident became a text for conjecture to the people; it was affirmed,\r\nthat the poisoners had rubbed all the benches and walls of the\r\ncathedral, and even the bell-ropes.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a new and more strange and significant spectacle struck\r\nthe wondering eyes of the citizens. In all parts of the city the doors\r\nof the houses and the walls were plastered with long streaks of whitish\r\nyellow dirt, which appeared to have been rubbed on with a sponge.\r\nWhether it was a wicked pleasantry to excite more general and thrilling\r\nalarm, or that it had been done from the guilty design of increasing the\r\npublic disorder; whatever was the motive, the fact is so well attested,\r\nthat it cannot be attributed to imagination. The city, already alarmed,\r\nwas thrown into the utmost confusion; the owners of houses purified all\r\ninfected places; strangers were stopped in the streets on suspicion, and\r\nconducted to prison, where they underwent long interrogatories which\r\nnaturally ended in proving none of these absurd and imaginary practices\r\nagainst them. The Tribunal of Health published a decree, offering a\r\nreward to whomsoever should discover the author or authors of this\r\nattempt; but they did this, as they wrote to the governor, only to\r\nsatisfy the people and calm their fears,\xe2\x80\x94a weak and dangerous\r\nexpedient, and calculated to confirm the popular belief.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time many attributed this story of the poisoned ointment to\r\nthe revenge of Gonsalvo Fernandez de Cordova; others to Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, in order the more easily to get possession of Milan; others\r\nagain affixed the crime to various Milanese gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThere were still many who were not persuaded that it was the plague,\r\nbecause if it were, every one infected would die of it; whereas a few\r\nrecovered. To dissipate every doubt, the Tribunal of Health made use of\r\nan expedient conformable to the necessity of the occasion; they made an\r\naddress to the eyes, such as the spirit of the times suggested. On one\r\nof the days of the feast of Pentecost, the inhabitants of the city were\r\naccustomed to go to the burying ground of San Gregorio, beyond the\r\neastern gate, in order to pray for the dead in the last plague. Turning\r\nthe season of devotion into one of amusement, every one was attired in\r\nhis best; on that day a whole family, among others, had died of the\r\nplague. At the hour in which the concourse was most numerous, the dead\r\nbodies of this family were, by order of the Tribunal of Health, drawn\r\nnaked on a carriage towards this same burying ground; so that the crowd\r\nmight behold for themselves the manifest traces, the hideous impress of\r\nthe disease. A cry of alarm and horror arose wherever the car passed;\r\ntheir incredulity was at least shaken, but it is probable that the great\r\nconcourse tended to spread the infection.\r\n\r\nStill it was not absolutely the _plague_; the use of the word was\r\nprohibited, it was a pestilential fever, the adjective was preferred to\r\nthe substantive,\xe2\x80\x94then, not the true plague,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the\r\nplague, but only in a certain sense,\xe2\x80\x94and further, combined with poison\r\nand witchcraft. Such is the absurd trifling with which men seek to blind\r\nthemselves, wilfully abstaining from a sound exercise of judgment to\r\narrive at the truth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as it became from day to day more difficult to raise funds to\r\nmeet the painful exigencies of circumstances, the council of ten\r\nresolved to have recourse to government. They represented, by two\r\ndeputies, the state of misery and distress of the city, the enormity of\r\nthe expense, the revenues anticipated, and the taxes withheld in\r\nconsequence of the general poverty which had been produced by so many\r\ncauses, and especially by the pillaging of the soldiery. That according\r\nto various laws, and a special decree of Charles V., the expense of the\r\nplague ought by right to devolve upon government. Finally, they\r\nproceeded to make four demands: that the taxes should be suspended; that\r\nthe chamber should advance funds; that the governor should make known to\r\nthe king the calamitous state of the city and province; and that the\r\nduchy, already exhausted, should be excused from providing quarters for\r\nthe soldiery. Spinola replied with new regrets and exhortations;\r\ndeclaring himself grieved not to be able to visit Milan in person, in\r\norder to employ himself for the preservation of the city, but hoping\r\nthat the zeal of the magistrates would supply his place: in short, he\r\nmade evasive answers to all their requests. Afterwards, when the plague\r\nwas at its height, he transferred, by letters patent, his authority to\r\nthe high chancellor Ferrer, being, as he said, obliged to devote himself\r\nentirely to the cares of the war.\r\n\r\nThe council of ten then requested the cardinal to order a solemn\r\nprocession, for the purpose of carrying through the streets the body of\r\nSan Carlos. The good prelate refused; this confidence in a doubtful\r\nmeans disturbed him, and he feared that, if the effect should not be\r\nobtained, confidence would be converted into infidelity, and rebellion\r\nagainst God. He also feared that if there really were poisoners, this\r\nprocession would be a favourable occasion for their machinations; and if\r\nthere were not, so great a collection would have a tendency to spread\r\nthe contagion.\r\n\r\nThe doors of public edifices and private houses had been again anointed\r\nas at first. The news flew from mouth to mouth; the people, influenced\r\nby present suffering, and by the imminence of the supposed danger,\r\nreadily embraced the belief. The idea of subtle instantaneous poison\r\nseemed sufficient to explain the violence, and the almost\r\nincomprehensible circumstances, of the disease. Add to this the idea of\r\nenchantment, and any effect was possible, every objection was rendered\r\nfeeble, every difficulty was explained. If the effects did not\r\nimmediately succeed the first attempt, the cause was easy to assign: it\r\nhad been done by those to whom the art was new; and now that it was\r\nbrought to perfection, the perpetrators were more confirmed in their\r\ninfernal resolution. If any one had dared to suggest its having been\r\ndone in jest, or denied the existence of a dark plot, he would have\r\npassed for an obstinate fool, if he did not incur the suspicion of being\r\nhimself engaged in it. With such persuasions on their minds, all were on\r\nthe alert to discover the guilty; the most indifferent action excited\r\nsuspicion, suspicion was changed to certainty, and certainty to rage.\r\n\r\nAs illustrations of this, Ripamonti cites two examples which fell under\r\nhis own observation, and such were of daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Antonio, on a day of some great solemnity, an old\r\nman, after having prayed for some time on his knees, rose to seat\r\nhimself, and before doing so, wiped the dust from the bench with his\r\nhandkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old man is poisoning the bench,\xe2\x80\x9d cried some women,\r\nwho beheld the action. The crowd in the church threw themselves upon\r\nhim, tore his white hair, and after beating him, drew him out half dead,\r\nto carry him to prison and to torture. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the unfortunate man,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nRipamonti; \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew the end of his painful story, but at the time I\r\nthought he had but a few moments to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other event occurred the next day; it was as remarkable, but not as\r\nfatal. Three young Frenchmen having come to visit Italy, and study its\r\nantiquities, had approached the cathedral, and were contemplating it\r\nvery attentively. Some persons, who were passing by, stopped; a circle\r\nwas formed around them; they were not lost sight of for a moment, having\r\nbeen recognised as strangers, and especially Frenchmen. As if to assure\r\nthemselves that the wall was marble, the young artists extended their\r\nhands to touch it. This was enough. In a moment they were surrounded,\r\nand, with imprecations and blows, dragged to prison. Happily, however,\r\nthey were proved to be innocent, and released.\r\n\r\nThese things were not confined to the city; the frenzy was propagated\r\nequally with the contagion. The traveller encountered off the high road,\r\nthe stranger whose habits or appearance were in any respect singular,\r\nwere judged to be poisoners. At the first intelligence of a new comer,\r\nat the cry even of a child, the alarm bell was rung; and the unfortunate\r\npersons were assailed with showers of stones, or seized and conducted to\r\nprison. And thus the prison itself was, during a certain period, a place\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the council of ten, not silenced by the refusal of the wise\r\nprelate, again urged their request for the procession, which the people\r\nseconded by their clamours. The cardinal again resisted, but finding\r\nresistance useless, he finally yielded; he did more, he consented that\r\nthe case which enclosed the relics of San Carlos should be exposed for\r\neight days on the high altar of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal of Health and the other authorities did not oppose this\r\nproceeding; they only ordained some precautions, which, without\r\nobviating the danger, indicated too plainly their apprehensions. They\r\nissued severe orders to prevent people from abroad entering the city;\r\nand, to insure their execution, commanded the gates to be closed. They\r\nalso nailed up the condemned houses; \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of which,\xe2\x80\x9d says a\r\ncontemporary writer, \xe2\x80\x9camounted to about five hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree days were employed in preparation; on the 11th of June the\r\nprocession left the cathedral at daybreak: a long file of people,\r\ncomposed for the most part of women, their faces covered with silk\r\nmasks, and many of them with bare feet, and clothed in sackcloth,\r\nappeared first. The tradesmen came next, preceded by their banners; the\r\nsocieties, in habits of various forms and colours; then the\r\nbrotherhoods, then the secular clergy, each with the insignia of his\r\nrank, and holding a lighted taper in his hand. In the midst, among the\r\nbrilliant light of the torches, and the resounding echo of the\r\ncanticles, the case advanced, covered with a rich canopy, and carried\r\nalternately by four canons, sumptuously attired. Through the crystal\r\nwere seen the mortal remains of the saint, clothed in his pontifical\r\nrobes, and his head covered with a mitre. In his mutilated features\r\nmight still be distinguished some traces of his former countenance, such\r\nas his portraits represent him, and such as some of the spectators\r\nremembered to have beheld and honoured. Behind the remains of the holy\r\nprelate, and resembling him in merit, birth, and dignity, as well as in\r\nperson, came the Archbishop Frederick. The rest of the clergy followed\r\nhim, and with them the magistrates in their robes, then the nobility,\r\nsome magnificently clothed, as if to do honour to the pomp of the\r\ncelebration, and others as penitents, in sackcloth and bare-footed, each\r\nbearing a torch in his hand. A vast collection of people terminated the\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThe streets were ornamented as on festival days: the rich sent out their\r\nmost precious furniture; and thus the fronts of the poorest houses were\r\ndecorated by their more wealthy neighbours, or at the expense of the\r\npublic. Here, in the place of hangings, and there, over the hangings\r\nthemselves, were suspended branches of trees; on all sides hung\r\npictures, inscriptions, devices; on the balconies were displayed vases,\r\nrich antiquities, and valuable curiosities; with burning flambeaux at\r\nvarious stations. From many of the windows the sequestrated sick looked\r\nout upon the procession, and mingled their prayers with those of the\r\npeople as they passed. The procession returned to the cathedral about\r\nthe middle of the day.\r\n\r\nBut the next day, whilst presumptuous and fanatical assurance had taken\r\npossession of every mind, the number of deaths augmented in all parts of\r\nthe city in a progression so frightful, and in a manner so sudden, that\r\nnone could avoid confessing the cause to have been the procession\r\nitself. However, (astonishing and deplorable power of prejudice!) this\r\neffect was not attributed to the assemblage of so many people, and to\r\nthe increase of fortuitous contact, but to the facility afforded to the\r\npoisoners to execute their infernal purposes. But as this opinion could\r\nnot account for so vast a mortality, and as no traces of strange\r\nsubstances had been discovered on the road of the procession, recourse\r\nwas had to another invention, admitted by general opinion in\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x94magical and poisoned powders! It was asserted that these\r\npowders, scattered profusely in the road, attached themselves to the\r\nskirts of the gowns, and to the feet of those who had been on that day\r\nbarefooted: thus the human mind delights itself with contending against\r\nphantoms of its own creating.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the contagion increased daily; in short, there was\r\nhardly a house that was not infected; the number of souls in the\r\nlazaretto amounted to 12,000, and sometimes to 16,000. The daily\r\nmortality, which had hitherto exceeded 500, soon increased to 1200 and\r\n1500.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine the agony of the council of ten, on whom rested the\r\nweighty burden of providing for the public necessities, and of repairing\r\nwhat was reparable in such a disaster: they had to replace every day,\r\nand every day to add to the number of individuals charged with public\r\nservices of all kinds. Of these individuals there were three remarkable\r\nclasses; the first was that of the _monatti_: this appellation, of\r\ndoubtful origin, was applied to those men who were devoted to the most\r\npainful and dangerous employment in times of contagion; the taking of\r\nthe dead bodies from the houses, from the streets, and from the\r\nlazaretto, carrying them to their graves, and burying them; also,\r\nbringing the sick to the lazaretto, and burning and purifying suspected\r\nor infected objects; the second class was that of the _apparitori_,\r\nwhose special function was to precede the funeral cars, ringing a bell\r\nto warn passengers to retire; and the third was that of the\r\ncommissaries, who presided over both the other classes, under the\r\nimmediate orders of the Tribunal of Health.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to keep the lazaretto furnished with medicine,\r\nsurgeons, food, and all the requisites of an infirmary; and it was also\r\nnecessary to find and prepare new habitations for new cases. Cabins of\r\nwood and straw were hastily constructed in the interior enclosure of the\r\nlazaretto; then a second lazaretto, a little beyond, was erected,\r\ncapable of containing 4000 persons. Two others were ordered, but means,\r\nmen, and courage failed, and they were never completed: despair and\r\nweakness had attained such a point, that the most urgent and painful\r\nwants were unprovided for; each day, for example, children, whose\r\nmothers had perished of the plague, died from neglect. The Tribunal of\r\nHealth proposed to found an hospital for these innocent creatures, but\r\ncould obtain no assistance for the purpose; all supplies were for the\r\narmy, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a time of war, and we must\r\ntreat the soldiers well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the immense ditch which had been dug near the lazaretto was\r\nfilled with dead bodies; a number still remained without sepulture, as\r\nhands were wanting for the work. Without extraordinary aid this calamity\r\nmust have remained unremedied. The president of the senate addressed\r\nhimself in tears to the two intrepid friars who governed the lazaretto,\r\nand the Father Michele pledged himself to relieve in four days the city\r\nof the unburied dead, and to dig, in the course of a week, another ditch\r\nsufficient not only for present wants, but even for those which might be\r\nanticipated in future. Followed by another friar, and public officers\r\nchosen by the president, he went into the country to procure peasants,\r\nand partly by the authority of the tribunal, partly by that of his\r\nhabit, he gathered 200, whom he employed to dig the earth. He then\r\ndespatched _monatti_ from the lazaretto to collect the dead. At the\r\nappointed time his promise was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt one time the lazaretto was left without physicians, and it was only\r\nafter much trouble and time, and great offers of money and honours, that\r\nothers could be prevailed on to supply their place. Provisions were\r\noften so scarce, as to create apprehensions of starvation, but more than\r\nonce these necessities were unexpectedly supplied by the charity of\r\nindividuals. In the midst of the general stupor, or the indifference to\r\nthe miseries of others, occasioned by personal apprehension, some were\r\nfound whose hands and hearts had ever been open to the wretched, and\r\nothers with whom the virtue of benevolence had commenced with the loss\r\nof all their terrestrial happiness. So also, amidst the destruction of\r\nthe flight of so many men charged with watching over and providing for\r\nthe public safety, others were seen, who, well in body and firm in mind,\r\never remained faithful at their post, and some even, who, by an\r\nadmirable self-devotion, sustained with heroic constancy cares to which\r\ntheir duty did not call them.\r\n\r\nThe most entire self-devotion was especially conspicuous among the\r\nclergy; at the lazarettos, in the city, their assistance was always at\r\nhand; they were found, wherever there was suffering, always in\r\nattendance on the sick and the dying; very often languishing and dying\r\nthemselves: with spiritual, they bestowed, as far as they could,\r\ntemporal succour. More than sixty clergymen in the city alone died from\r\nthe contagion, which was nearly eight out of nine.\r\n\r\nFrederick, as might be expected, was an example to all; after having\r\nseen all his household perish around him, he was solicited by his\r\nfamily, by the first magistrates, and by the neighbouring princes, to\r\nfly the peril, but he rejected their advice and their solicitations with\r\nthe same firmness which induced him to write to the clergy of his\r\ndiocese:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBe disposed to abandon life rather than these sufferers, who\r\nare your children, and your family; go with the same joy into the midst\r\nof the pestilence, as to a certain reward, since you may, by these\r\nmeans, win many souls to Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d He neglected no precaution compatible\r\nwith his duty: he even gave instructions to his clergy on this point;\r\nbut he betrayed no anxiety, nor did he even appear to perceive danger,\r\nwhere it was necessary to incur it, in order to do good. He was always\r\nwith the ecclesiastics, to praise and direct the zealous, and to excite\r\nthe lukewarm; he visited the lazarettos to console the sick, and\r\nencourage those who assisted them; he travelled over the city, carrying\r\naid to the miserable who were sequestered in their houses, stopping at\r\ntheir doors and under their windows, to listen to their complaints, and\r\nto give them words of consolation and encouragement. Having thus thrown\r\nhimself into the midst of the contagion, it was truly wonderful that he\r\nnever was attacked by it.\r\n\r\nIn seasons of public calamity, when confusion takes the place of order,\r\nwe often behold a display of the sublimest virtue, but more frequently,\r\nalas! an increase of vice and crime. Instances of the latter were not\r\nwanting during the present unhappy period. The profligate, spared by the\r\nplague, found in the common confusion, and in the slackening of the\r\nrestraints of law, new occasions for mischief, and new assurances of\r\nimpunity. And further, power itself had passed into the hands of the\r\nboldest among them. There were scarcely found for the functions of\r\n_monatti_ and _apparitori_ any, but those over whom the attraction of\r\nrapine and licence had more sway than dread of the contagion. Strict\r\nrules had been prescribed to them, and severe penalties threatened for\r\ninfringing them, which had some power for awhile; but the number of\r\ndeaths, and the increasing desolation, and the universal alarm, soon\r\nrelieved them from all superintendence, and they constituted themselves\r\n(the _monatti_ in particular) the arbiters of every thing. They entered\r\nhouses as masters and enemies; and, not to mention their robberies, and\r\nthe cruel treatment which those unhappy persons experienced whom the\r\nplague condemned to their authority, they applied their infected and\r\ncriminal hands to those in health, threatening to carry them to the\r\nlazaretto, unless they purchased their exemption with money. At other\r\ntimes they refused to carry off the dead bodies already in a state of\r\nputrefaction, without a high price being paid them; it is even said,\r\nthat they designedly let fall from their carts infected clothing, in\r\norder to propagate the infection from which their wealth was derived.\r\nMany ruffians, too, assuming the garb of these wretches, carried on\r\nextensive robberies in the houses of the sick, dying, and helpless.\r\n\r\nIn the same proportion as vice increased, folly increased; the foolish\r\nidea was again revived of _poisonings_; the dread of this fantastic\r\ndanger beset and tormented the minds of men more than the real and\r\npresent danger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ripamonti, \xe2\x80\x9cthe heaps of dead bodies lying\r\nbefore the eyes of the living made the city a vast tomb, there was\r\nsomething more afflicting and hideous still\xe2\x80\x94reciprocal distrust and\r\nextravagant suspicion; and this not only between friends, neighbours,\r\nand guests; but husbands, wives, and children, became objects of terror\r\nto one another, and, horrible to tell! even the domestic board and the\r\nnuptial bed were dreaded as snares, as places were poison might be\r\nconcealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBesides ambition and cupidity, the motives commonly attributed to the\r\npoisoners, it was imagined that this action included an indefinable,\r\ndiabolical voluptuousness of enjoyment, an attractiveness stronger than\r\nthe will. The ravings of the sick, who accused themselves of that which\r\nthey had dreaded in others, were considered as so many involuntary\r\nrevelations, which rendered belief irresistible.\r\n\r\nAmong the stories recorded of this delirium, there is one which deserves\r\nto be related, on account of the extensive credence it obtained.\r\n\r\nIt was said that on a certain day, a citizen had seen an equipage with\r\nsix horses stop in the square of the cathedral. Within it was a person\r\nof a noble and majestic figure, dark complexion, eyes inflamed, and lips\r\ncompressed and threatening. The spectator being invited to enter the\r\ncarriage, complied. After a short circuit, it made a halt before the\r\ngate of a magnificent palace. Entering it he beheld mingled scenes of\r\ndelight and horror, frightful deserts and smiling gardens, dark caverns\r\nand magnificent saloons. Phantoms were seated in council. They showed\r\nhim large boxes of money, telling him he might take as many of them as\r\nhe chose, provided he would accept at the same time a little vase of\r\npoison, and consent to employ it against the citizens. He refused, and\r\nin a moment found himself at the place from which he had been taken.\r\nThis story, generally believed by the people, spread all over Italy. An\r\nengraving of it was made in Germany. The Archbishop of Mayence wrote to\r\nCardinal Frederick, asking him what credence might be attached to the\r\nprodigies related of Milan. He received for answer, that they were all\r\nidle dreams.\r\n\r\nThe dreams of the learned, if they were not of the same nature as those\r\nof the vulgar, did not exceed them in value; the greater part beheld the\r\nforerunner and the cause of these calamities, in a comet which appeared\r\nin 1628, and in the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Another comet\r\nthat appeared in June in the same year announced the poisonous\r\nanointings. All writings were ransacked that contained any passages\r\nrespecting poisons; amongst the ancients, Livy was cited, Tacitus,\r\nDionysius, even Homer and Ovid were searched. Among the moderns,\r\nCesalpino, Cardan, Grevino, Salio, Pareo Schenchio, Zachia, and lastly\r\nthe fatal Delrio, whose _Disquisitions on Magic_ became the text book on\r\nsuch subjects, the future rule, and, in fact, the powerful impulse to\r\nhorrible and frequent legal murders.\r\n\r\nThe physicians yielded to the popular belief, and attributed to poison\r\nand diabolical conjurations the ordinary symptoms of the malady. Even\r\nTadino himself, one of the most celebrated physicians of his day, who\r\nhad witnessed the entrance of the disorder, anticipated its ravages,\r\nstudied its symptoms, and admitted it to be _the plague_, even he, such\r\nis the strange perversity of human reason, drew from all these facts an\r\nargument in proof of the dissemination of some subtle poison, by means\r\nof ointments. Nor was the enlightened Cardinal Frederick himself\r\naltogether uninfected by the general mania. In a small tract of his on\r\nthe subject in the Ambrosian Library, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cOf the mode of\r\ncompounding and dispensing these ointments, various statements have been\r\nmade, some of which we hold for true, while others appear imaginary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Muratori tells us, that he had met with well-informed\r\npersons in Milan, whose ancestors were decidedly convinced of the\r\nabsurdity of this widely spread and extraordinary error, but whose\r\nsafety rendered it imperative on them to keep their sentiments on the\r\nsubject to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates employed the little vigilance and resolution which\r\nremained to them in searching out the poisoners, and unhappily thought\r\nthey had detected them. A recital of these and similar cases would form\r\na remarkable feature in the history of jurisprudence. But it is high\r\ntime we should resume the thread of our story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night, towards the end of the month of August, in the very height of\r\nthe pestilence, Don Roderick returned to his house at Milan, accompanied\r\nby his faithful Griso, one of the small number of his servants who still\r\nsurvived. He had just left a company of friends, who were accustomed to\r\nassemble together, to banish by debauchery the melancholy of the times;\r\nat each meeting there were new guests added, and old ones missing. On\r\nthat day Don Roderick had been one of the gayest, and, among other\r\nsubjects of merriment which he introduced, he had made the company laugh\r\nat a mock funeral sermon on Count Attilio, who had been carried off by\r\nthe pestilence a few days before.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the house where he had held his carousal, he was conscious\r\nof an uneasiness, a faintness, a weariness of his limbs, a difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and an internal heat, which he was ready to attribute to the\r\nwine, the late hour, and the influence of the season. He spoke not a\r\nword during the whole route. Arriving at his house, he ordered Griso to\r\nlight him to his chamber. Griso, perceiving the change in his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance, kept at a distance, as, in these dangerous times, every one\r\nwas obliged to keep for himself, as was said, a medical eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel very well, do you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, reading in the\r\nfeatures of Griso the thoughts which were passing through his mind,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel very well; but I have drank a little too much. The wine was so\r\nfine! With a good sleep all will be well again. I am overcome by sleep.\r\nTake away the light; I cannot bear it; it troubles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the effect of the wine, signor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso, still keeping at a\r\ndistance; \xe2\x80\x9cbut go to bed, sleep will do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right; if I could sleep\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I am well, were it not for the want\r\nof sleep. Place the little bell near me, in case I should want\r\nsomething; and be attentive if I ring. But I shall need nothing. Carry\r\naway that cursed light,\xe2\x80\x9d added he; \xe2\x80\x9cit troubles me more than I can\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso carried off the light; and, wishing his master a good night, he\r\nquitted the apartment as Don Roderick crouched beneath the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nBut the bed-clothes weighed upon him like a mountain; throwing them off,\r\nhe endeavoured to compose himself to sleep; hardly had he closed his\r\neyes when he awoke with a start, as if he had been roused by a blow, and\r\nhe felt that the pain and fever had increased. He endeavoured to find\r\nthe cause of his sufferings in the heat of the weather, the wine, and\r\nthe debauch in which he had just been engaged; but one idea\r\ninvoluntarily mingled itself with all his reflections, an idea at which\r\nhe had been laughing all the evening with his companions, as it was\r\neasier to make it a subject of raillery than to drive it away,\xe2\x80\x94the idea\r\nof the plague.\r\n\r\nAfter having struggled a long time, he at last fell asleep, but was\r\ntormented by frightful dreams. It appeared to him that he was in a vast\r\nchurch, in the midst of a crowd of people. How he came there he could\r\nnot tell, nor how the thought to do so could have entered his head,\r\nespecially at such a time. Looking on those by whom he was surrounded,\r\nhe perceived them to be lean, livid figures, with wild and glaring eyes;\r\nthe garments of these hideous creatures fell in shreds from their\r\nbodies, and through them might be seen frightful blotches and swellings.\r\nHe thought he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGive way, you rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d as he looked towards the\r\ndoor, which was far, far off, accompanying the cry with a menacing\r\nexpression of countenance, and wrapping his arms around his body to\r\nprevent coming in contact with them, for they seemed to be touching him\r\non every side. But they moved not, nor even seemed to hear him: it\r\nappeared to him, however, that some one amongst them, with his elbow,\r\npressed his left side near his heart, where he felt a painful pricking.\r\nTrying to withdraw himself from so irksome a situation, he experienced a\r\nrecurrence of the sensation. Irritated beyond measure, he stretched out\r\nhis hand for his sword, and, behold, it had glided the whole length of\r\nhis body, and the hilt of it was pressing him in this very place. Vainly\r\ndid he endeavour to remove it, every effort only increased his agonies.\r\nAgitated and out of breath, he again cried aloud; at the sound, all\r\nthose wild and hideous phantoms rushed to one side of the church,\r\nleaving the pulpit exposed to view, in which stood, with his venerable\r\ncountenance, his bald head and white beard, Father Christopher. It\r\nappeared to Don Roderick that the capuchin, after having looked over the\r\nassembly, fixed his eyes upon him, with the same expression as on the\r\nwell-remembered interview in his castle, and, at the same time, raised\r\nhis arm, and held it suspended above his head; making an effort to\r\narrest the blow, a cry which struggled in his throat escaped him, and he\r\nawoke. He opened his eyes; the light of day, which was already advanced,\r\npressed upon his brain, and imparted as keen an anguish as the torch of\r\nthe preceding night. Looking around on his bed and his room, he\r\ncomprehended that it was a dream; the church, the crowd, the friar, all\r\nhad vanished; but not so the pain in his left side. He was sensible of\r\nan agonising and rapid beating of his heart, a buzzing in his ears, an\r\ninternal heat which consumed him, and a weight and weariness in his\r\nlimbs greater than when he went to bed. He could not resolve to look at\r\nthe spot where he felt the pain; but, finally gathering courage to do\r\nso, he beheld with horror a hideous tumour of a livid purple.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick saw that he was lost. The fear of death took possession of\r\nhim, and with it came the apprehension, stronger perhaps than the dread\r\nof death itself, of becoming the prey of the _monatti_, and of being\r\nthrown into the lazaretto. Endeavouring to think of some means of\r\navoiding this terrible fate, he experienced a confusion and obscurity in\r\nhis ideas which told him that the moment was fast approaching when he\r\nshould have no feeling left but of despair. Seizing the bell, he shook\r\nit violently. Griso, who was on the watch, appeared immediately;\r\nstopping at a distance from the bed, he looked attentively at his\r\nmaster, and became certain of that which he had only conjectured the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGriso,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Roderick, with difficulty raising himself in his bed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have always been my favourite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always done well by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consequence of your goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can trust you, I think. I am ill, Griso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceived that you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am cured, I will do still more for you than I have ever yet done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso made no answer, waiting to see to what this preamble would lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not trust any one but you,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Don Roderick; \xe2\x80\x9cdo me a\r\nfavour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where the surgeon Chiodo lives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an honest man, who, if he be well paid, keeps secret the sick. Go\r\nto him; tell him I will give him four or six crowns a visit,\xe2\x80\x94more, if\r\nhe wishes it. Tell him to come here immediately; act with prudence; let\r\nno one get knowledge of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell thought of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griso; \xe2\x80\x9cI will return immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, Griso, give me a little water; I burn with thirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord, nothing without the advice of a physician. This is a rapid\r\ndisease, and there is no time to lose. Be tranquil. In the twinkling of\r\nan eye, I will be here with the signor Chiodo.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nDon Roderick followed him in imagination to the house of Chiodo, counted\r\nhis steps, measured the time. He often looked at his side, but,\r\nhorror-struck, could only regard it a moment. Continuing to listen\r\nintently for the arrival of the surgeon, this effort of attention\r\nsuspended the sense of suffering, and left him the free exercise of his\r\nthoughts. Suddenly he heard a noise of small bells, which appeared to\r\ncome from some of the apartments, and not from the street. Listening\r\nagain, he heard it louder, and at the same time a sound of steps. A\r\nhorrible suspicion darted across his mind. He sat up, listened still\r\nmore attentively, and heard a sound in the next chamber, as of a chest\r\ncarefully placed on the floor; he threw his limbs out of bed, so as to\r\nbe ready to rise; and kept his eyes fastened on the door; it opened,\r\nand, behold, two _monatti_ with their diabolical countenances, and\r\ncursed liveries, advancing towards the bed, whilst from the half-open\r\ndoor was seen the figure of Griso, awaiting the success of his sordid\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, infamous traitor! Begone, rascals! Biondino, Carlotto, help!\r\nmurder!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Roderick, extending his hand under his pillow for his\r\npistol.\r\n\r\nAt his very first cry the _monatti_ had rushed towards the bed, and the\r\nmost active of the two was upon him before he could make another\r\nmovement; jerking the pistol from his hand, and throwing it on the\r\nfloor, he forced him to lie down, crying in an accent of rage and\r\nmockery, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, scoundrel! against the _monatti_! against the ministers of\r\nthe tribunal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep him down until we are ready to carry him out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, as\r\nhe advanced to a strong box. Griso entered the room, and with him\r\ncommenced forcing its lock. \xe2\x80\x9cVillain!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Don Roderick, struggling\r\nto get free: \xe2\x80\x9clet me kill this infamous rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the\r\n_monatti_, \xe2\x80\x9cand then you may do with me what you will.\xe2\x80\x9d He then called\r\nagain loudly on his other servants, but in vain; the abominable Griso\r\nhad sent them far away with orders as if from his master, before he\r\nhimself went to propose this expedition, and a share of its spoils, to\r\nthe _monatti_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, be quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, who held him extended on the bed, to\r\nthe unhappy Don Roderick; then, turning to those who were taking the\r\nbooty, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBehave like honest men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! you!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Don Roderick to Griso, \xe2\x80\x9cyou! after\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Ah, demon\r\nof hell! I may still be cured! I may still be cured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriso spoke not a word, and was careful to avoid looking at his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold him tight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other _monatto_, \xe2\x80\x9che is frantic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate man, after many violent efforts, became suddenly\r\nexhausted; but from time to time was seen to struggle feebly and vainly,\r\nfor a moment, against his persecutors.\r\n\r\nThe _monatti_ deposited him on a hand-barrow which had been left in the\r\nouter room; one of them returned for the booty, then raising their\r\nmiserable burden, they carried him off. Griso remained awhile to make a\r\nselection of such articles as were valuable and portable; he had been\r\nvery careful not to touch the _monatti_, nor be touched by them; but, in\r\nhis thirst for gain, his prudence forsook him; taking the different\r\narticles of his master\xe2\x80\x99s dress from off the bed, he shook them, for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining if there was money in them.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, occasion to remember his want of caution the next day;\r\nwhilst carousing in a tavern, he was seized with a shivering, his eyes\r\ngrew dim, his strength failed, and he fell lifeless. Abandoned by his\r\ncompanions, he fell into the hands of the _monatti_, who, after having\r\nplundered him, threw him on a car, where he expired, before arriving at\r\nthe lazaretto to which his master had been carried.\r\n\r\nWe must leave Don Roderick in this abode of horror, and return to Renzo,\r\nwhom our readers may remember we left in a manufactory under the name of\r\nAntony Rivolta. He remained there five or six months; after which, war\r\nbeing declared between the republic and the King of Spain, and all fear\r\non his account having ceased, Bortolo hastened to bring him back, both\r\nbecause he was attached to him, and because Renzo was a great assistance\r\nto the _factotum_ of a manufactory, without the possibility of his ever\r\naspiring to be one himself, on account of his inability to write.\r\nBortolo was a good man, and in the main generous, but, like other men,\r\nhe had his failings; and as this motive really had a place in his\r\ncalculations, we have thought it our duty to state it. From this time\r\nRenzo continued to work with his cousin. More than once, and especially\r\nafter having received a letter from Agnes, he felt a desire to turn\r\nsoldier; and opportunities were not wanting, for at this epoch the\r\nrepublic was in want of recruits. The temptation was the stronger, as\r\nthere was a talk of invading the Milanese, and it appeared to him that\r\nit would be a fine thing to return there as a conqueror, see Lucy again,\r\nand have an explanation with her; but Bortolo always diverted him from\r\nthis resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they go there,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthey can go without you,\r\nand you can go afterwards at your leisure. If they return with broken\r\nheads, you will be glad to have been out of the scrape. The Milanese is\r\nnot a mouthful to be easily swallowed; and then the question, my friend,\r\nturns on the power of Spain. Have a little patience. Are you not well\r\nhere? I know what you will say; but if it is written above that the\r\naffair shall succeed, succeed it will, without your committing more\r\nfollies. Some saint will come to your assistance. Believe me, war is not\r\na trade for you. It needs men expressly trained to the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt other times Renzo thought of returning home in disguise, under a\r\nfalse name, but Bortolo dissuaded him from this project also.\r\n\r\nThe plague afterwards spreading over all the Milanese, and advancing to\r\nthe Bergamascan territory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, reader, our design is not\r\nto relate its history; all that we would say is, that Renzo was attacked\r\nwith it, and recovered. He was at death\xe2\x80\x99s door; but his strong\r\nconstitution repelling the disease, in a few days he was out of danger.\r\nWith life, the hopes and recollections and projects of life returned\r\nwith greater vigour than ever; more than ever were his thoughts occupied\r\nwith his Lucy: what had become of her in these disastrous times? \xe2\x80\x9cTo be\r\nat so short distance from her, and to know nothing concerning her, and\r\nto remain, God knows how long, in this uncertainty! and then her vow! I\r\nwill go myself, I will go and relieve these terrible doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she lives, I will find her; I will hear herself explain this\r\npromise; I will show her that it is not binding; and I will bring her\r\nhere, and poor Agnes also, who has always wished me well, and I am sure\r\ndoes so still,\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will go in search of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able to walk, he went in search of Bortolo, who had\r\nkept himself shut up in his house, on account of the pestilence. He\r\ncalled to him to come to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bortolo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have recovered. It is well for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still some weakness in my limbs, as you see, but I am out of\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish I was on your legs. Formerly, when one said, _I am well_, it\r\nexpressed all that could be desired; but now-a-days that is of little\r\nconsequence. When one can say _I am better_, that\xe2\x80\x99s the word for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo informed his cousin of his determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo now, and may Heaven bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cavoid the law as I\r\nshall avoid the pestilence; and if it is the will of God, we shall see\r\neach other again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall certainly return. If I were only sure of not returning\r\nalone! I hope for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I join in your hopes; if God wills, we will work, and live\r\ntogether here. Heaven grant you may find me here, and that this devilish\r\ndisease may have ceased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again, we shall meet again, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say again, God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few days Renzo, finding his strength sufficiently restored,\r\nprepared for his departure; he put on a girdle in which he placed the\r\nfifty crowns sent him by Agnes, together with his own small savings; he\r\ntook under his arm a small bundle of clothes, and secured in his pocket\r\nhis certificate of good conduct from his second master; and having armed\r\nhimself with a good knife, a necessary appendage to an honest man in\r\nthose days, he commenced his journey towards the end of August, three\r\ndays after Don Roderick had been carried to the lazaretto. He took the\r\nroad to Lecco, before venturing into Milan, as he hoped to find Agnes\r\nthere, and learn from her some little of what he desired so much to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe small number of those who had been cured of the plague formed a\r\nprivileged class amidst the rest of the population; those who had not\r\nbeen attacked by the disease lived in perpetual apprehension of it; they\r\nwalked about with precaution, with an unquiet air, with a hurried and\r\nhesitating step; the former, on the contrary, nearly certain of security\r\n(for to have the plague twice was rather a prodigy than a rarity),\r\nadvanced into the very midst of the pestilence with boldness and\r\nunconcern. With such security, tempered, however, by his own peculiar\r\nanxieties, and by the spectacle of the misery of a whole people, Renzo\r\ntravelled towards his village, under a fine sky, and through a beautiful\r\ncountry; meeting on the way, after long intervals of dismal solitude,\r\nmen more like shadows and wandering phantoms than living beings; or dead\r\nbodies about to be consigned to the trench without funeral rites.\r\nTowards the middle of the day he stopped in a grove to eat his meat and\r\nbread; he was bountifully supplied with fruits from the gardens by the\r\nroad, for the year was remarkably fertile, the trees along the road were\r\nladen with figs, peaches, plums, apples, and other various kinds, with\r\nhardly a living creature to gather them.\r\n\r\nTowards evening he discovered his village; although prepared for the\r\nsight, he felt his heart beat, and he was assailed in a moment by a\r\ncrowd of painful recollections and harrowing presentiments: a deathlike\r\nsilence reigned around. His agitation increased as he entered the\r\nchurchyard, and became hardly supportable at the end of the lane\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nthere, where stood the house of Lucy\xe2\x80\x94one only of its inmates could now\r\nbe there, and the only favour he asked from Heaven was to find Agnes\r\nstill living; he hoped to find an asylum at her cottage, as he judged\r\ntruly that his own must be in ruins.\r\n\r\nAs he went on he looked attentively before him, fearing, and at the same\r\ntime hoping, to meet some one from whom he might obtain information. He\r\nsaw at last a man seated on the ground, leaning against a hedge of\r\njessamines, in the listless attitude of an idiot. He thought it must be\r\nthe poor simpleton Jervase, who had been employed as a witness in his\r\nunsuccessful expedition to the curate\xe2\x80\x99s house. But approaching nearer,\r\nhe recognised it to be Anthony. The disease had affected his mind, as\r\nwell as his body, so that in every act a slight resemblance to his weak\r\nbrother might be traced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, stopping before him, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you?\xe2\x80\x9d Tony raised\r\nhis eyes, but not his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTony, do you not know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it my turn? Is it my turn?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Tony! do you indeed not know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it my turn? Is it my turn?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with an idiotic smile, and\r\nthen stood with his mouth open.\r\n\r\nRenzo, seeing he could draw nothing from him, passed on still more\r\nafflicted than before. Suddenly, at a turn of the path, he beheld\r\nadvancing towards him a person whom he recognised to be Don Abbondio.\r\nHis pale countenance and general appearance showed that he also had not\r\nescaped the tempest. The curate, seeing a stranger, anxiously examined\r\nhis person, whose costume was that of Bergamo. At length he recognised\r\nRenzo with much surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it he, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and raised his hands with a movement of\r\nwonder and dismay. His wasted arms seemed trembling in his sleeves,\r\nwhich before could hardly contain them.\r\n\r\nRenzo, hastening towards him, bowed profoundly; for, although he had\r\nquitted him in anger, he still felt respect for him as his curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here! you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am here, as you see. Do you know any thing of Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know? nothing is known of her. She is at Milan, if she is\r\nstill in this world. But you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Agnes, is she living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is; but who do you think can tell? she is not here.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to Valsassina, among her relatives at Pasturo; for they\r\nsay that down there the pestilence has not made such ravages as it has\r\nhere. But you, I say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that. And Father Christopher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been gone this long time. But you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that,\xe2\x80\x94but has he not returned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, we have heard nothing of him. But you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, I say, what do you do here? For the love of Heaven, have you\r\nforgotten that little circumstance of the order for your apprehension?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it? people have other things to think of now. I came here\r\nto see about my own affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to see about; there is no one here now. It is the\r\nheight of rashness in you to venture here, with this little difficulty\r\nimpending. Listen to an old man who has more prudence than yourself, and\r\nwho speaks to you from the love he bears you. Depart at once, before any\r\none sees you, return whence you came. Do you think the air of this place\r\ngood for you? Know you not that they have been here on the search for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it too well, the rascals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I tell you, they think no more about it. And _he_, does _he_ yet\r\nlive? is _he_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you there is no one here; I tell you to think no more of the\r\naffairs of this place; I tell you that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you if _he_ is here;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just Heaven! Speak in another manner. Is it possible you still\r\nretain so much warmth, after all that has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _he_ here, or is _he_ not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not. But the plague, my son, the plague keeps every one from\r\ntravelling at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the pestilence was all that we need fear\xe2\x80\x94I speak for myself, I have\r\nhad it, and I fear it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better render thanks to Heaven. And\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, from the bottom of my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not go in search of other evils, I say. Listen to my advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had it also, sir, if I am not mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I have, truly! most terrible it was! it is by a miracle I am here;\r\nyou see how it has left me. I have need of repose to restore my\r\nstrength; I was beginning to feel a little better. In the name of\r\nHeaven, what do you do here? Go away, I beseech you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always return to your _go away_. If I ought to go away, I would not\r\nhave come. You keep saying, _What do you come for? what do you come\r\nfor?_ Sir, I am come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, have there been many deaths here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Don Abbondio; and beginning with Perpetua, he gave a long\r\nlist of individuals, and even whole families. Renzo expected, it is\r\ntrue, a similar recital; but hearing the names of so many acquaintances,\r\nfriends, and relations, he was absorbed by his affliction, and could\r\nonly exclaim, from time to time, \xe2\x80\x9cMisery! misery! misery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is not yet over,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cIf those who remain do\r\nnot listen to reason, and calm the heat of their brains, it will be the\r\nend of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not concern yourself; I do not intend to remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven be praised! you talk reason at last. Go at once\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not trouble yourself about it; the affair belongs to me. I think I\r\nhave arrived at years of discretion. I hope you will tell no one that\r\nyou have seen me. You are a priest, and I am one of your flock; you will\r\nnot betray me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. You would\r\nruin yourself, and me with you. What you have suffered, what I have\r\nsuffered, is not sufficient. I understand, I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d And continuing\r\nto mutter between his teeth, he proceeded on his way.\r\n\r\nRenzo, afflicted and disappointed, reflected where he should seek\r\nanother asylum. In the catalogue of deaths given to him by Don Abbondio,\r\nthere was a family which had all been carried off by the pestilence,\r\nwith the exception of a young man nearly of his own age, who had been\r\nhis companion from infancy. The house was a short distance off, a little\r\nbeyond the village; he bent his steps thither, to seek the hospitality\r\nwhich it might afford him. On his way he passed his own vineyard. The\r\nvines were cut, the wood carried off. Weeds of various kinds and most\r\nluxuriant growth, principally of the parasitical order, covered the\r\nplace, displaying the most brilliant flowers above the loftiest branches\r\nof the vines, and obstructing the progress of the miserable owner. The\r\ngarden beyond presented a similar scene of varied and luxuriant\r\nwildness. The house, that had not escaped the visitation of the\r\nlansquenets, was deformed with filth, dust, and cobwebs. Poor Renzo\r\nturned away with imbittered feelings, and moved slowly onwards to his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s. It was evening. He found him seated before the door, on a\r\nsmall bench, his arms crossed on his breast, with the air of a man\r\nstupified by distress, and suffering from solitude. At the sound of\r\nsteps he turned, and the twilight and the foliage not permitting him to\r\ndistinguish objects distinctly, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAre there not others besides\r\nme? Did I not do enough yesterday? Leave me in quiet; it will be an act\r\nof charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo, not knowing what this meant, called him by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRenzo?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, and they ran towards each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend: \xe2\x80\x9coh, how happy I am to see you! who\r\nwould have thought it? I took you for one of those persons who torment\r\nme daily to help to bury the dead. Know you that I am left alone? alone!\r\nalone as a hermit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it but too well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo. They entered the cottage together,\r\neach making numerous enquiries of the other. His friend began to prepare\r\nthe table for supper; he went out, and returned in a few moments with a\r\npitcher of milk, a little salt meat, and some fruit. They seated\r\nthemselves at table, at which the polenta was not forgotten, mutually\r\ncongratulating each other on their interview. An absence of two years,\r\nand the circumstances under which they met, revived and added new vigour\r\nto their former friendship.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, could supply the place of Agnes to Renzo, not only on\r\naccount of the particular affection she bore him, but she alone\r\npossessed the key to the solution of all his difficulties. He hesitated\r\nawhile whether he had not best go in search of her, as she was not very\r\nfar off; but recollecting that he knew nothing of the fate of Lucy, he\r\nadhered to his first intention of gaining all the information he could\r\nconcerning her, and carrying the result to her mother. He learnt from\r\nhis friend, however, many things of which he was ignorant, others were\r\nexplained which he only knew by halves, with regard to the adventures of\r\nLucy, and the persecutions she had undergone. He was also informed that\r\nDon Roderick had left the village, and had not returned. Renzo learnt,\r\nmoreover, to pronounce the name of Don Ferrante properly; Agnes, it is\r\ntrue, had caused it to be written to him, but Heaven knows how it was\r\nwritten; and the Bergamascan interpreter had given it so strange a\r\nsound, that if he had not received some instruction from his friend,\r\nprobably no one in Milan would have guessed whom he meant, although this\r\nwas the only clue he had to guide him to Lucy. As far as the law was in\r\nquestion his mind was set at rest. The signor Podest\xc3\xa0 was dead, and most\r\nof the officers; the others were removed, or had other matters too\r\npressing to occupy their attention. He related, in his turn, his own\r\nadventures to his friend, receiving in exchange an account of the\r\npassage of the army, the pestilence, the poisoners, and the prodigies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful as are our afflictions,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he led him for the night\r\nto a little chamber which the epidemic had deprived of its inhabitants,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is a mournful consolation in speaking of them to our friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the break of day they both arose, and Renzo prepared to depart. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nall goes well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif I find her living\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94I will return. I\r\nwill go to Pasturo and carry the joyful news to poor Agnes, and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94but if, by a misfortune, which may God avert\xe2\x80\x94then, I know not\r\nwhat I shall do, nor where I shall go; but you will never see me here\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he stood on the threshold of the door, about to resume his journey,\r\nhe contemplated for a moment, with a mixture of tenderness and anguish,\r\nhis village, which he had not beheld for so long a time. His friend\r\naccompanied him a short distance on his road, and bade him farewell,\r\nprognosticating a happy return, and many days of prosperity and\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nRenzo travelled leisurely, because there was ample time for him to\r\narrive within a short distance of Milan, so as to enter it on the\r\nmorrow. His journey was without accident, except a repetition of the\r\nsame wretched scenes that the roads at that time presented. As he had\r\ndone the day before, he stopped in a grove to make a slight repast,\r\nwhich the generosity of his friend had bestowed on him. Passing through\r\nMonza, he saw loaves of bread displayed in the window of a shop; he\r\nbought two of them, but the shopkeeper called to him not to enter;\r\nstretching out a shovel, on which was a small bowl of vinegar and water,\r\nhe told him to throw the money into it; then with a pair of tongs he\r\nreached the bread to him, which Renzo put in his pocket.\r\n\r\nTowards evening he passed through Greco, and quitting the high road,\r\nwent into the fields in search of some small house where he might pass\r\nthe night, as he did not wish to stop at an inn. He found a better\r\nshelter than he anticipated; perceiving an opening in a hedge which\r\nsurrounded the yard of a dairy, he entered it boldly. There was no one\r\nwithin: in one corner of it was a barn full of hay, and against the door\r\nof it a ladder placed. After looking around, Renzo ascended the ladder,\r\nsettled himself for the night, and slept profoundly until the break of\r\nday. When he awoke, he descended the ladder very cautiously, and\r\nproceeded on his way, taking the dome of the cathedral for his polar\r\nstar. He soon arrived before the walls of Milan near the eastern gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nRenzo had heard vague mention made of severe orders, forbidding the\r\nentrance of strangers into Milan, without a certificate of health; but\r\nthese were easily evaded, for Milan had reached a point when such\r\nprohibition was useless, even if it could have been put into execution.\r\nWhoever ventured there, might rather appear careless of his own life,\r\nthan dangerous to that of others.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction, Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s design was to attempt a passage at the\r\nfirst gate, and in case of difficulty to wander on the outside of the\r\nwalls until he should find one easy of access. It would be difficult to\r\nsay how many gates he thought Milan had.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived before the ramparts, he looked around him; there was no\r\nindication of living being, except on a point of the platform, a thick\r\ncloud of dense smoke arising; this was occasioned by clothing, beds, and\r\ninfected furniture, which were committed to the flames; every where\r\nalong the ramparts appeared the traces of these melancholy\r\nconflagrations.\r\n\r\nThe weather was close, the air heavy, the sky covered by a thick cloud,\r\nor fog, which excluded the sun, without promising rain. The surrounding\r\ncountry was neglected and sterile; all verdure extinct, and not a drop\r\nof dew on the dry and withering leaves. The depth, solitude, and\r\nsilence, so near a large city, increased the gloom of Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts;\r\nhe proceeded, without being aware of it, to the gate _Nuova_, which had\r\nbeen hid from his view by a bastion, behind which it was then concealed.\r\nA noise of bells, sounding at intervals, mingled with the voices of men,\r\nsaluted his ear; turning an angle of the bastion, he saw before the gate\r\na sentry-box, and a sentinel leaning on his musket, with a wearied and\r\ncareless air. Exactly before the opening was a sad obstacle, a\r\nhand-barrow, upon which two _monatti_ were extending an unfortunate man,\r\nto carry him off; it was the chief of the toll-gatherers, who had just\r\nbeen attacked by the pestilence. Renzo awaited the departure of the\r\nconvoy, and no one appearing to close the gate, he passed forwards\r\nquickly; the sentinel cried out \xe2\x80\x9cHolla!\xe2\x80\x9d Renzo stopping, showed him a\r\nhalf ducat, which he drew from his pocket; whether he had had the\r\npestilence, or that he feared it less than he loved ducats, he signed to\r\nRenzo to throw it to him; seeing it at his feet, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGo in,\r\nquickly,\xe2\x80\x9d a permission of which Renzo readily availed himself. He had\r\nhardly advanced forty paces when a toll-collector called to him to stop.\r\nHe pretended not to hear, and passed on. The call was repeated, but in a\r\ntone more of anger than of resolution to be obeyed\xe2\x80\x94and this being\r\nequally unheeded, the collector shrugged his shoulders and turned back\r\nto his room.\r\n\r\nRenzo proceeded through the long street opposite the gate which leads to\r\nthe canal _Naviglio_, and had advanced some distance into the city\r\nwithout encountering a single individual; at last he saw a man coming\r\ntowards him, from whom he hoped he might gain some information; he moved\r\ntowards him, but the man showed signs of alarm at his approach. Renzo,\r\nwhen he was at a little distance, took off his hat, like a polite\r\nmountaineer as he was, but the man drew back, and raising a knotty club,\r\narmed with a spike, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOff! off! off!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo; he\r\nput on his hat, and having no desire for a greeting of this fashion, he\r\nturned his back on the discourteous passenger and went on his way.\r\n\r\nThe citizen retired in an opposite direction, shuddering and looking\r\nback in alarm: when he reached home he related how a poisoner had met\r\nhim with humble and polite manners, but with the air of an infamous\r\nimpostor, and with a phial of poison or the box of powder (he did not\r\nknow exactly which) in the lining of his hat, to poison him, if he had\r\nnot kept him at a distance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was unlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we were in\r\nso private a street; if it had been in the midst of Milan, I would have\r\ncalled the people, and he would have been seized: but alone, it was\r\nenough to have saved myself\xe2\x80\x94but who knows what destruction he may not\r\nalready have effected in the city:\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and years after, when the\r\npoisoners were talked of, the poor man maintained the truth of the fact,\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9che had had ocular proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo was far from suspecting the danger he had escaped; and, reflecting\r\non this reception, he was more angry than fearful. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bad\r\nbeginning,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; \xe2\x80\x9cmy star always seems unpropitious when I enter\r\nMilan. To enter is easy enough, but, once here, misfortunes thicken.\r\nHowever\xe2\x80\x94by the help of God\xe2\x80\x94if I find\xe2\x80\x94if I succeed in finding\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nwill be well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe streets were silent and deserted; no human being could he see; a\r\nsingle disfigured corpse met his eye in the channel between the street\r\nand the houses. Suddenly he heard a cry, which appeared addressed to\r\nhim; and he perceived, not far off, on the balcony of a house, a woman,\r\nsurrounded by a group of children, making a sign to him to approach. As\r\nhe did so, \xe2\x80\x9cO good young man!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cdo me the kindness to go to\r\nthe commissary, and tell him that we are forgotten here. They have\r\nnailed up the house as suspected, because my poor husband is dead; and\r\nsince yesterday morning no one has brought us any thing to eat, and\r\nthese poor innocents are dying of hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf hunger!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, drawing the two loaves\r\nfrom his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cLower something in which I may put them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod reward you! wait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, as she went in search\r\nof a basket and cord to suspend it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the commissary, my good woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting the loaves in\r\nthe basket, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot serve you, because, to tell truth, I am a stranger\r\nin Milan, and know nothing of the place. However, if I meet any one a\r\nlittle humane and tractable, to whom I can speak, I will tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman begged him to do so, and gave him the name of the street in\r\nwhich she lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can also render me a service, without its costing you any thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me where there is a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s house in Milan,\r\nnamed ***?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know there is a house of that name, but I do not know where it is.\r\nFurther on in the city you will probably find some one to direct you.\r\nAnd remember to speak of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not doubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, as he passed on.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced, he heard increasing a sound that had already attracted\r\nhis attention, whilst stopping to converse with the poor woman; a sound\r\nof wheels and horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, with the noise of little bells, and\r\noccasionally the cracking of whips and loud cries.\r\n\r\nAs he reached the square of San Marco, the first objects he saw were two\r\nbeams erected, with a cord and pulleys. He recognised the horrible\r\ninstrument of torture! These were placed on all the squares and widest\r\nstreets, so that the deputies of each quarter of the city, furnished\r\nwith the most arbitrary power, could subject to them whoever quitted a\r\ncondemned house, or neglected the ordinances, or by any other act\r\nappeared to merit the punishment; it was one of those extreme and\r\ninefficacious remedies, which, at this epoch, were so absurdly\r\nauthorised. Now, whilst Renzo was gazing at this machine, he heard the\r\nsounds increasing, and beheld a man appear, ringing a little bell; it\r\nwas an _apparitore_, and behind him came two horses, who advanced with\r\ndifficulty, dragging a car loaded with dead; after this car came\r\nanother, and another, and another; _monatti_ walked by the side of the\r\nhorses, urging them on with their whips and with oaths. The bodies were\r\nfor the most part naked; some were half covered with rags, and heaped\r\none upon another; at each jolt of the wretched vehicles, heads were seen\r\nhanging over, the long tresses of women were displayed, arms were\r\nloosened and striking against the wheels, thrilling the soul of the\r\nspectator with indescribable horror!\r\n\r\nThe youth stopped at a corner of the square to pray for the unknown\r\ndead. A frightful thought passed over his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, perhaps, there,\r\nwith them\xe2\x80\x94O God! avert this misfortune! let me not think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe funeral convoy having passed on, he crossed the square, and reached\r\nthe Borgo Nuovo by the bridge Marcellino. He perceived a priest standing\r\nbefore a half-open door, in an attitude of attention, as if he were\r\nconfessing some one. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis my man. If a priest, and in\r\nthe discharge of his duty, has no benevolence, there is none left in the\r\nworld who has.\xe2\x80\x9d When he was at a few paces distance from him, he took\r\noff his hat, and made a sign that he wished to speak with him, keeping,\r\nhowever, at a discreet distance, so as not to alarm the good man\r\nunnecessarily. Renzo having made his request, was directed to the hotel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God watch over you now and for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would ask another favour.\xe2\x80\x9d And he mentioned the poor forgotten woman.\r\nThe worthy man thanked him for affording him the opportunity to bestow\r\nhelp where it was so greatly needed, and bade him farewell.\r\n\r\nRenzo found it difficult enough to recollect the various turnings\r\npointed out by the priest, disturbed as his mind was by apprehensions\r\nfor the issue of his enquiries. An end was about to be put to his doubts\r\nand fears; he was to be told, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is living,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nidea took such powerful possession of his mind, that at this moment, he\r\nwould rather have remained in his former ignorance, and have been at the\r\ncommencement of the journey, to the end of which he so nearly\r\napproached. He gathered courage, however. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cif I play the\r\nchild now, how will it end!\xe2\x80\x9d Plunging therefore into the heart of the\r\ncity, he soon reached one of its most desolated quarters, that which is\r\ncalled the _Carrobio di Porta Nuova_. The fury of the contagion here,\r\nand the infection from the scattered bodies, had been so great, that\r\nthose who had survived had been obliged to fly: so that, whilst the\r\npassenger was struck with the aspect of solitude and death, his senses\r\nwere painfully affected by the traces of recent life. Renzo hastened on,\r\nhoping to find an improvement in the scene, before he should arrive at\r\nthe end of his journey. In fact, he soon reached what might still be\r\ncalled the city of the living, but, alas! what living! Every door was\r\nclosed from distrust and terror, except such as had been left open by\r\nthe flight of the inhabitants, or by the _monatti_; some were nailed on\r\nthe outside, because there were within people dead, or dying of the\r\npestilence; others were marked with a cross, for the purpose of\r\ninforming the _monatti_ that their services were required, and much of\r\nthis was done more by chance than otherwise; as a commissary of health\r\nhappened to be in one spot rather than in another, and chose to enforce\r\nthe regulations. On every side were seen infected rags and bandages,\r\nclothes and sheets, which had been thrown from the windows; dead bodies\r\nwhich had been left in the streets until a car should pass to take them\r\nup, or which had fallen from the cars themselves, or been thrown from\r\nthe houses; so much had the long duration and the violence of the pest\r\nbrutalised men\xe2\x80\x99s minds, and subdued every spark of human feeling or\r\nsympathy. The customary sounds of human occupation or pleasure had\r\nceased; and this silence of death was interrupted only by the funeral\r\ncars, the lamentations of the sick, the shrieks of the frantic, or the\r\nvociferations of the _monatti_.\r\n\r\nAt the break of day, at noon, and at night, a bell of the cathedral gave\r\nthe signal for reciting certain prayers, which had been ordered by the\r\narchbishop, and this was followed by the bells of the other churches.\r\nThen persons were seen at the windows, and a confused blending of voices\r\nand groans was heard, which inspired a sorrow, not however unmixed with\r\nconsolation. It is probable that at this time not less than two thirds\r\nof the inhabitants had died, and of the remainder many were sick or had\r\nleft the city. Every one you met exhibited signs of the dreadful\r\ncalamity. The usual dress was changed of every order of persons. The\r\ncloak of the gentleman, the robe of the priest, the cowl of the monk, in\r\nshort, every loose appendage of dress that might occasion contact, was\r\ncarefully dismissed; every thing was as close on the person as possible.\r\nMen\xe2\x80\x99s beards and hair were alike neglected, from fear of treachery on\r\nthe part of the barbers. Every man walked with a stick, or even a\r\npistol, to prevent the approach of others. Equal care was shown in\r\nkeeping the middle of the street to avoid what might be thrown from\r\nwindows, and in avoiding the noxious matters in the road. But if the\r\naspect of the uninfected was appalling, how shall we describe the\r\ncondition of the wretched sick in the street, tottering or falling to\r\nrise no more\xe2\x80\x94beggars, children, women.\r\n\r\nRenzo had travelled far on his way, through the midst of this\r\ndesolation, when he heard a confused noise, in which was distinguishable\r\nthe horrible and accustomed tinkling of bells.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of one of the most spacious streets, he perceived four\r\ncars standing; _monatti_ were seen entering houses, coming forth with\r\nburthens on their shoulders, and laying them on the cars; some were\r\nclothed in their red dress, others without any distinctive mark, but the\r\ngreater number with a mark, more revolting still than their customary\r\ndress,\xe2\x80\x94plumes of various colours, which they wore with an air of\r\ntriumph in the midst of the public mourning, and whilst people from the\r\ndifferent windows around were calling to them to remove the dead. Renzo\r\navoided, as much as possible, the view of the horrid spectacle; but his\r\nattention was soon attracted by an object of singular interest; a\r\nfemale, whose aspect won the regards of every beholder, came out of one\r\nof the houses, and approached the cars. In her features was seen beauty,\r\nveiled and clouded, but not destroyed, by the mortal debility which\r\nseemed to oppress her; the soft and majestic beauty which shines in the\r\nLombard blood. Her step was feeble, but decided; she wept not, although\r\nthere were traces of tears on her countenance. There was a tranquillity\r\nand profundity in her grief, which absorbed all her powers. But it was\r\nnot _her_ appearance alone which excited compassion in hearts nearly\r\nclosed to every human feeling; she held in her arms a young girl about\r\nnine years of age, dead, but dressed with careful precision; her hair\r\ndivided smoothly on her pale forehead, and clothed in a robe of the\r\npurest white. She was not lying, but was seated, on the arm of the lady,\r\nher head leaning on her shoulder; you would have thought she breathed,\r\nif a little white hand had not hung down with inanimate weight, and her\r\nhead reposed on the shoulder of her mother, with an abandonment more\r\ndecided than that of sleep. Of her mother! it was indeed her mother! If\r\nthe resemblance of their features had not told it, you would have known\r\nit by the expression of that fair and lovely countenance!\r\n\r\nA hideous _monatto_ approached the lady, and with unusual respect\r\noffered to relieve her of her burthen. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with an\r\nappearance neither of anger nor disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not touch her yet; it is I\r\nwho must place her on the car. Take this,\xe2\x80\x9d and she dropped a purse into\r\nthe hands of the _monatto_; \xe2\x80\x9cpromise me not to touch a hair of her head,\r\nnor to let others do it, and bury her thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _monatto_ placed his hand on his heart, and respectfully prepared a\r\nplace on the car for the infant dead. The lady, after having kissed her\r\nforehead, placed her on it, as carefully as if it were a couch, spread\r\nover her a white cloth, and took a last look; \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell! Cecilia! rest\r\nin peace! To-night we will come to you, and then we shall be separated\r\nno more!\xe2\x80\x9d Turning again to the _monatto_, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you pass to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will come for me; and not for me only!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned into the house, and a moment after appeared at a window,\r\nholding in her arms another cherished child, who was still living, but\r\nwith the stamp of death on her countenance. She contemplated the\r\nunworthy obsequies of Cecilia, until the car disappeared from her eyes,\r\nand then left the window with her mournful burthen. And what remained\r\nfor them, but to die together, as the flower which proudly lifts its\r\nhead, falls with the bud, under the desolating scythe which levels every\r\nherb of the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9csave her! protect her! her and this innocent\r\ncreature! they have suffered enough! they have suffered enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded on his way, filled with emotions of distress and pity.\r\nAnother convoy of wretched victims encountered him at a cross street on\r\ntheir way to the lazaretto. Some were imploring to be allowed to die on\r\ntheir own beds in peace; some moving on with imbecile apathy, women as\r\nusual with their little ones, and even some of these supported and\r\nencouraged with manly devotion by their brothers a little older than\r\nthemselves, and whom alone the plague had for a time spared for this\r\naffecting office. When the miserable crowd had nearly passed, he\r\naddressed a commissary whose aspect was a little less savage than the\r\nrest; and enquired of him the street and the house of Don Ferrante. He\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe first street to the right, the last hotel to the left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man hastened thither, with new and deeper trouble at his\r\nheart. Easily distinguishing the house, he approached the door, raised\r\nhis hand to the knocker, and held it suspended awhile, before he could\r\nsummon resolution to knock.\r\n\r\nAt the sound, a window was half opened, and a female appeared at it,\r\nlooking towards the door with a countenance which appeared to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit _monatti_? thieves? or poisoners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, but in a tremulous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cis there not here in\r\nservice a young villager of the name of Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is no longer here; begone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman, about to close the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment, I beseech you. She is no longer here! Where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the lazaretto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment, for the love of Heaven! With the pestilence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is something very uncommon, is it not? Begone then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait an instant. Was she very ill? Is it long since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this time the window was closed entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! signora, signora! one word, for charity! Alas! alas! one word!\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nhe might as well have talked to the wind.\r\n\r\nAfflicted by this intelligence, and vexed with the rude treatment of the\r\nwoman, Renzo seized the knocker again, and raised it for the purpose of\r\nstriking. In his distress, he turned to look at the neighbouring houses,\r\nwith the hope of seeing some one, who would give him more satisfactory\r\ninformation. But the only person he discovered, was a woman, about\r\ntwenty paces off, who, with an appearance of terror, anger, and\r\nimpatience, was making signs to some one to approach; and this she did,\r\nas if not wishing to attract Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Perceiving him looking at\r\nher, she shuddered with horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, threatening her with his fist, but she,\r\nhaving lost the hope of his being seized unexpectedly, cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\npoisoner! catch him! catch him! stop the poisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? I! old sorceress! be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, as he approached her in\r\norder to compel her to be so. But he soon perceived that it was best to\r\nthink of himself, as the cry of the woman had gathered people from every\r\nquarter; not in so great numbers as would have been seen three months\r\nbefore under similar circumstances, but still many more than one man\r\ncould resist. At this moment, the window was again opened, and the same\r\ndiscourteous woman appeared at it, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cSeize him, seize him; he\r\nmust be one of the rascals who wander about to poison the doors of\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo determined in an instant that it was better to fly than to stop to\r\njustify himself. Rapidly casting his eyes around to see on which side\r\nthere were the fewest people, and fighting his way through those that\r\nopposed him, he soon freed himself from their clutches.\r\n\r\nThe street was deserted before him; but behind him the terrible cry\r\nstill resounded, \xe2\x80\x9cSeize him! stop him! a poisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d It gained on him,\r\nsteps were close at his heels. His anger became rage; his agony,\r\ndespair; drawing his knife from his pocket, and brandishing it in the\r\nair, he turned, crying aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cLet him who dares come here, the rascal,\r\nand I will poison him indeed with this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he saw, with astonishment and pleasure, that his persecutors had\r\nalready stopped, as if some obstacle opposed their path; and were making\r\nfrantic gestures to persons beyond him. Turning again, he beheld a car\r\napproaching, and even a file of cars with their usual accompaniments.\r\nBeyond them was another little band of people prepared to seize the\r\npoisoner, but prevented by the same obstacle. Seeing himself thus\r\nbetween two fires, it occurred to Renzo, that _that_ which was an object\r\nof terror to these people, might be to him a source of safety.\r\nReflecting that this was not a moment for fastidious scruples, he\r\nadvanced towards the cars, passed the first, and perceiving in the\r\nsecond a space large enough to receive him, threw himself into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! bravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the _monatti_ with one shout. Some of them were\r\nfollowing the convoy on foot, others were seated on the cars, others on\r\nthe dead bodies, drinking from an enormous flagon, which they passed\r\naround. \xe2\x80\x9cBravo! that was well done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have placed yourself under the protection of the _monatti_; you are\r\nas safe as if you were in a church,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, who was seated on the car\r\ninto which Renzo had thrown himself.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was obliged to retreat, crying, however, \xe2\x80\x9cSeize him! seize\r\nhim! he is a poisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me silence them!\xe2\x80\x9d said the _monatto_; and drawing from one of the\r\ndead bodies a dirty rag, he tied it up in a bundle, and made a gesture\r\nas if intending to throw it among them, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d At the\r\nsight, all fled away in horror!\r\n\r\nA howl of triumph arose from the _monatti_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! you see we can protect honest people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _monatto_ to\r\nRenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cone of us is worth a hundred of those cowards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe my life to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thank you sincerely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a trifle, a trifle; you deserve it; \xe2\x80\x99tis plain to be seen you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nbrave fellow; you do well to poison this rabble; extirpate the fools,\r\nwho, as a reward for the life we lead, say, that the plague once over,\r\nthey will hang us all. They must all be finished, before the plague\r\nceases; the _monatti_ alone must remain to sing for victory, and to\r\nfeast in Milan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife to the pestilence, and death to the rabble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another,\r\nputting the flagon to his mouth, from which he drank freely, and then\r\noffered it to Renzo, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cDrink to our health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it to you all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not thirsty, and do not\r\nwant to drink now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been terribly frightened, it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _monatto_; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nappear to be a harmless sort of a person; you should have another face\r\nthan that for a poisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said a _monatto_, who walked by the side of the cars;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would drink to the health of the nobleman, who is here in such good\r\ncompany\xe2\x80\x94in yonder carriage!\xe2\x80\x9d And with a malignant laugh he pointed to\r\nthe car in which poor Renzo was seated. Then brutally composing his\r\nfeatures to an expression of gravity, he bowed profoundly, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou permit, my dear master, a poor devil of a _monatto_ to taste a\r\nlittle wine from your cellar? Do now, because we lead rough lives, and\r\nmoreover, we are doing you the favour to take you a ride into the\r\ncountry. And besides, you are not accustomed to wine, and it might harm\r\nyour lordship; but the poor _monatti_ have good stomachs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions laughed loudly; he took the flagon, and before he drank,\r\nturned again to Renzo, and with an air of insulting compassion said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil with whom you have made a compact, must be very young; if we\r\nhad not saved you, you would have been none the better for his\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions laughed louder than before, and he applied the flagon to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave some for us! some for us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried those from the forward car.\r\nAfter having taken as much as he wanted, he returned the flagon to his\r\ncompanions, who passed it on; the last of the company having emptied it,\r\nthrew it on the pavement, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the pestilence!\xe2\x80\x9d Then they\r\ncommenced singing a lewd song, in which they were accompanied by all the\r\nvoices of the horrible choir. This infernal music, blended with the\r\ntingling of the bells, the noise of the wheels, and of the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet,\r\nresounded in the empty silence of the streets, echoed through the\r\nhouses, wringing the hearts of the very few who still inhabited them!\r\n\r\nBut the danger of the preceding moment had rendered more than tolerable\r\nto Renzo, the company of these wretches and the dead they were about to\r\ninter; and even this music was almost agreeable to his ears, as it\r\nrelieved him from the embarrassment of such conversation. He returned\r\nthanks to Providence for having enabled him to escape from his peril,\r\nwithout receiving or doing an injury; and he prayed God to help him now\r\nto deliver himself from his liberators. He kept on the watch to seize\r\nthe first opportunity of quietly quitting the car, without exciting the\r\nopposition of his protectors.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached the lazaretto. At the appearance of a commissary,\r\none of the two _monatti_ who were on the car with Renzo jumped to the\r\nground, in order to speak with him: Renzo hastily quitting the car, said\r\nto the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for your kindness; God reward you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go, poor poisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cit will not be you who will\r\ndestroy Milan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately no one heard him. Renzo hastened onwards by the wall,\r\ncrossed the bridge, passed the convent of the capuchins, and then\r\nperceived the angle of the lazaretto. In front of the inclosure a\r\nhorrible scene presented itself to his view. Arrived in front of the\r\nlazaretto, throngs of sick were pressing into the avenues which led to\r\nthe building; some were seated or lying in the ditch, which bordered the\r\nroad on either side, their strength not having sufficed to enable them\r\nto reach their asylum, or who, having quitted it in desperation, were\r\ntoo weak to go further; others wandered by themselves, stupified, and\r\ninsensible to their condition; one was quite animated, relating his\r\nimaginations to a miserable companion, who was stretched on the ground,\r\noppressed by suffering; another was furious from despair; a third, more\r\nhorrible still! was singing, in a voice above all the rest, and with\r\nheart-rending hilarity, one of the popular songs of love, gay and\r\nplayful, which the Milanese call _villanelle_.\r\n\r\nAlready weary, and confounded at the view of so much misery concentrated\r\nwithin so small a space, our poor Renzo reached the gate of the\r\nlazaretto. He crossed the threshold, and stood for a moment motionless\r\nunder the portico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine the lazaretto, peopled with sixteen thousand\r\npersons infected with the plague: the vast enclosure was encumbered with\r\ncabins, tents, cars, and human beings. Two long ranges of porticoes, to\r\nthe right and left, were crowded with the dying or the dead, extended\r\nupon straw; and from the immense receptacle of woe, was heard a deep\r\nmurmur, similar to the distant voice of the waves, agitated by a\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\nRenzo went forward from hut to hut, carefully examining every\r\ncountenance he could discern within\xe2\x80\x94whether broken down by suffering,\r\ndistorted by spasm, or fixed in death. Hitherto he met none but men, and\r\njudged, therefore, that the women were distributed in some other part\r\nof the inclosure. The state of the atmosphere seemed to add to the\r\nhorror of the scene: a dense and dark fog involved all things. The disc\r\nof the sun, as if seen through a veil, shed a feeble light in its own\r\npart of the sky, but darted down a heavy deathlike blast of heat: a\r\nconfused murmuring of distant thunder might be heard. Not a leaf moved,\r\nnot a bird was seen\xe2\x80\x94save the swallow only, which descended to the\r\nplain, and, alarmed at the dismal sounds around, remounted the air, and\r\ndisappeared. Nature seemed at war with human existence\xe2\x80\x94hundreds seemed\r\nto grow worse\xe2\x80\x94the last struggle more afflictive\xe2\x80\x94and no hour of\r\nbitterness was comparable to that.\r\n\r\nRenzo had, in his search, witnessed, as he thought, every variety of\r\nhuman suffering. But a new sound caught his ear\xe2\x80\x94a compound of\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s crying and goats\xe2\x80\x99 bleating: looking through an opening of the\r\nboards of a hut, he saw children, infants, lying upon sheets or quilts\r\nupon the floor, and nurses attending them; but the most singular part of\r\nthe spectacle, was a number of she-goats supplying the maternal\r\nfunctions, and with all the appearance of conscious sympathy hastening,\r\nat the cries of the helpless little ones, to afford them the requisite\r\nnutrition. The women were aiding these efficient coadjutors, in\r\nrendering their supplies available to the poor bereft babies. Whilst\r\nobserving this wretched scene, an old capuchin entered with two infants,\r\njust taken from their lifeless mother, to seek among the flock for one\r\nto supply her place. Quitting this spot, and looking about on every\r\nside, a sudden apparition struck his sight, and set his thoughts in\r\ncommotion. He saw at some distance, among the tents, a capuchin, whom he\r\ninstantly recognised to be Father Christopher!\r\n\r\nThe history of the good friar, from the moment in which we lost sight of\r\nhim until this meeting, may be related in few words. He had not stirred\r\nfrom Rimini, and he would not now have thought of doing so if the plague\r\nbreaking out at Milan had not afforded him the opportunity, so long\r\ndesired, of sacrificing his life for the benefit of others. He demanded,\r\nas a favour, permission to go and assist those who were infected with\r\nthe disease. The count, he of the secret council, was dead; and\r\nmoreover, at this time, there was a greater want of guardians to the\r\nsick, than of politicians: his request was readily granted. He had now\r\nbeen in the lazaretto nearly three months.\r\n\r\nBut the joy of Renzo at seeing the good father was not unalloyed. It was\r\nhe indeed; but, alas! how changed! how wan! Exhausted nature appeared to\r\nbe sustained for a while by the mind, that had acquired new vigour from\r\nthe perpetual demand on its sympathies and activity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Father Christopher!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, when he was near enough to speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, my father, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than these unfortunate beings that you see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friar.\r\nHis voice was feeble\xe2\x80\x94hollow and changed as his person. His eye alone\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chad not lost its original brightness\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94benevolence and charity appeared\r\nto have imparted to it a lustre superior to that which bodily weakness\r\nwas gradually extinguishing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are you here? Why do you thus come to brave\r\nthe pestilence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had it, thank Heaven! I come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94in search of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Lucy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy! Is Lucy here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. At least I hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she thy wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear father! alas! no, she is not my wife. Do you know nothing,\r\nthen, of what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my son. Since God removed me from you, I have heard nothing. But\r\nnow that he sends you to me, I wish much to know. And your banishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, then, what they did to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, what did _you_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, if I were to say I was prudent on that day at Milan, I\r\nshould tell a falsehood; but I committed no bad action wilfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you; I have always thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then I will tell you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached a cabin, and called \xe2\x80\x9c_Father Victor_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a young capuchin appeared. \xe2\x80\x9cDo me the favour, Father\r\nVictor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto take my place in watching over our poor patients\r\nfor a little while. If, however, any should particularly ask for me, be\r\nso good as to call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young friar complied, and Father Christopher, turning to Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus enter here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou appear much exhausted,\r\nyou have need of food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. Now that you make me think of it, I have not tasted any\r\nthing to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, then, a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d He soon brought Renzo a bowl of broth, from a\r\nlarge kettle, the common property of the establishment, and making him\r\nsit down on his bed, the only seat his cabin afforded, and placing some\r\nwine on a little table by his side, he seated himself next him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ntell me about my poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand be in haste, for time is\r\nprecious, and I have much to do, as you perceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo related the history of Lucy; that she had been sheltered in the\r\nconvent of Monza, and carried off from her asylum. At the idea of such\r\ntreatment and peril, and at the thought, too, that it was he who had\r\nunwittingly exposed her to it, the good friar was breathless with\r\nattention; but he recovered his tranquillity when he heard of her\r\nmiraculous deliverance, her restoration to her mother, and her having\r\nbeen placed under the protection of Donna Prassede.\r\n\r\nRenzo then briefly related his journey to Milan, his flight, and his\r\nreturn home; that he had not found Agnes there; and at Milan had learned\r\nthat Lucy was in the lazaretto. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am here,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded he, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhere in search of her; to see if she yet lives, and if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94she still\r\nthinks of me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what direction did they give you? Did they tell you where she was\r\nplaced when she came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing, dear father, nothing; only that she is here, if she\r\nstill lives, which may God grant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor child! But what have you done here until now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have searched, and searched, but have seen hardly any but men. I\r\nthink the females must be in another part by themselves; you can tell me\r\nif this is the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you not that it is forbidden to men to enter there unless their\r\nduty calls them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well! what can happen to me if I should attempt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law is a good one, my dear son; and if our weight of affliction\r\ndoes not permit us to enforce it, is that a reason why an honest man\r\nshould infringe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Father Christopher, Lucy should have been my wife; you know how we\r\nhave been separated; it is twenty months since I have suffered, and\r\ntaken my misfortunes patiently; I have come here, risking every thing to\r\nbehold her, and now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not what to say,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the friar; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are, no doubt, guided\r\nby a praiseworthy motive; would to God that all those who have free\r\naccess to these places conducted themselves as well as I am sure you\r\nwill. God, who certainly blesses thy perseverance of affection, thy\r\nfidelity in desiring and seeking her whom he has given thee, God, who is\r\nmore rigorous than man, but also more indulgent, will not regard what\r\nmay be irregular in this enquiry for one so dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he arose, and Renzo followed him. While listening to him, he\r\nhad been confirmed in his resolution not to acquaint the father with\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s vow. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he learns that,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9che will certainly raise\r\nnew difficulties. Either I shall find her, and we can then disclose,\r\nor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94what use would it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter having conducted him to the opening of the cabin, towards the\r\nnorth, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom yonder little temple,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9crising above the miserable\r\ntents, Father Felix is about to lead in procession the small remnant who\r\nare convalescent, to another station, to finish their quarantine. Avoid\r\nnotice, but watch them as they pass. If she is not of the number, this\r\nside,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, pointing to the edifice before them, \xe2\x80\x9cthis side of the\r\nbuilding and a part of the field before it are assigned to the women.\r\nYou will perceive a railing which divides that quarter from this, but so\r\nbroken, in many places, that you can easily pass through. Once there, if\r\nyou do nothing to offend, probably no one will speak to you. If,\r\nhowever, there is any difficulty, say that Father Christopher knows you,\r\nand will answer for you. Seek her, then, seek her with confidence\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwith resignation; for remember, it is an unusual expectation, a person\r\nalive within the walls of the lazaretto! Go, then, and be prepared for\r\nwhatever result\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, a dark cloud overshadowing his\r\ncountenance; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand, I will seek in every place, from one end of\r\nthe lazaretto to the other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94And if I do not find her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not find her?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the father, in a serious and\r\nadmonitory tone.\r\n\r\nBut Renzo, giving vent to the wrath which had been for some time pent up\r\nin his bosom, pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I do not find her, I will find _another_\r\nperson. Either at Milan, or in his abominable palace, or at the end of\r\nthe world, or in the house of the devil, I will find the villain who\r\nseparated us; but for whom Lucy would have been mine twenty months ago;\r\nand if we had been destined to die, at least we should have died\r\ntogether. If he still lives, I will find him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRenzo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, seizing him by the arm, and looking at him\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I find him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Renzo, entirely blinded by rage, \xe2\x80\x9cif the\r\npestilence has not already done justice\xe2\x80\x94the time is past when a\r\npoltroon, surrounded by bravoes, can reduce men to despair, and laugh at\r\nthem! the time is come when men meet face to face, and I will do myself\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy youth!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Father Christopher, with a voice which had\r\nsuddenly become strong and sonorous, his head raised, and eyes darting\r\nforth more than their wonted fire; \xe2\x80\x9cunhappy youth! look around you!\r\nBehold who punishes and who judges; who punishes and pardons! But you,\r\nfeeble worm, you would do yourself justice! Do you know what justice is?\r\nUnhappy youth! begone! I hoped\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94yes, I hoped that before I died, God\r\nwould afford me the consolation to learn that my poor Lucy still lived;\r\nto see her, perhaps, and to hear her promise that she would send a\r\nprayer to yonder grave where I shall rest. Begone, you have taken away\r\nmy hope. God has not left her on the earth for thee, and you certainly\r\nhave not the audacity to believe yourself worthy that God should think\r\nof consoling you. Go, I have no time to listen to you farther.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ndropped the arm of Renzo, which he had grasped, and moved towards a\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, following him with a supplicating look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill you send me away thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the capuchin, but in a gentler tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you dare ask\r\nme to steal the time from these poor afflicted ones, who are expecting\r\nme to speak to them of the pardon of God, in order to listen to thy\r\naccents of rage\xe2\x80\x94thy projects of vengeance? I listened to you, when you\r\nasked consolation and advice, but now that you have revenge in your\r\nheart, what do you want with me? Begone, I have listened to the\r\nforgiveness of the injured, and the repentance of the aggressor; I have\r\nwept with both; but what have I to do with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I pardon him! I pardon him! I pardon him for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRenzo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, in a calmer tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthink of it, and tell me how\r\noften you have pardoned him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kept silence some time, and not receiving an answer, he bowed his\r\nhead, and, with a voice trembling from emotion, continued, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know why\r\nI wear this habit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI likewise hated, I, who have reprimanded you for a thought, a word.\r\nThe man I hated, I killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it was a noble, one of those\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the friar. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that were justification, believe\r\nyou I should not have found it in thirty years? Ah! if I could now make\r\nyou experience the sentiment I have since had, and that I now have for\r\nthe man I hated! If _I_ could _I_!\xe2\x80\x94but God can. May he do it! Hear me,\r\nRenzo. He is a better friend to you, than you are to yourself; you have\r\nthought of revenge, but He has power enough, pity enough, to prevent it;\r\nyou know you have often said that he can arrest the arm of the powerful;\r\nbut learn, also, that he can arrest that of the vindictive. And because\r\nyou are poor, because you are injured, can he not defend against you a\r\nman created in his image? Will he suffer you to do all you wish? No! but\r\nhe can cast you off for ever; he can, for this sentiment which animates\r\nyou, embitter your whole life, since, whatever happens to you, hold for\r\ncertain, that all will be punishment until you have pardoned, pardoned\r\nfreely and for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, with much emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I have never\r\ntruly pardoned him; I have spoken as a brute and not as a Christian; and\r\nnow, by the help of God, I pardon him from the bottom of my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd should you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would pray God to grant me patience, and to touch his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that the Lord has not only told us to pardon our\r\nenemies, but to love them? Do you remember that he loved them so as to\r\ndie for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come and behold him. You have said you would find him; you shall\r\ndo so; come, and you will see against whom you preserve hatred, to whom\r\nyou desire evil, against what life you would arm yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the hand of Renzo, who followed him, without daring to ask a\r\nquestion. The friar led the way into one of the cabins. The first object\r\nRenzo beheld was a sick person seated on a bed of straw, who appeared to\r\nbe convalescent. On seeing the father, he shook his head, as if to say\r\n_No_. The father bowed his with an air of sorrow and resignation. Renzo,\r\nmeanwhile, gazing with uneasy curiosity around the cabin, beheld in the\r\ncorner of it a sick person lying on a feather bed, wrapped up in a\r\nsheet, and covered with a cloak. Looking attentively, he recognised Don\r\nRoderick! The unfortunate man lay motionless; his eyes wide open, but\r\nwithout any cognisance of the objects around him; the stamp of death was\r\non his face, which was covered with black spots; his lips were swollen\r\nand black: you would have thought it the face of the dead, if a violent\r\ncontraction about the mouth had not revealed a tenacity of life; his\r\nrespiration was painful, and his livid hand, extending on the outside of\r\nthe covering, was firmly grasping his cloak, and pressing it upon his\r\nheart, as if conscious that _there_ was his deepest agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, in a low solemn voice; \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentiment you hold\r\ntowards this man, who has offended you, such will God hold towards you\r\non the great day. Bless him, and be blessed! For four days he has been\r\nhere in this condition, without giving any sign of perception. Perhaps\r\nthe Lord is disposed to grant him an hour of repentance, but he would\r\nhave you pray for it; perhaps he desires that you should pray for him\r\nwith this innocent girl; perhaps he reserves this favour for thy prayer\r\nalone, for the prayer of an afflicted and resigned heart. Perhaps the\r\nsalvation of this man and thine own depend at this moment upon thyself,\r\nupon thy pity, upon thy love.\xe2\x80\x9d He kept silence, and clasping his hands,\r\nbowed his head as in prayer, and Renzo, completely subdued, followed his\r\nexample. Their supplications were interrupted in a short time by the\r\nstriking of a bell: they immediately arose and left the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe procession is about to move,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father; \xe2\x80\x9cgo then, prepared\r\nto make a sacrifice, to praise God, whatever may be the issue of your\r\nsearch; and whatever that may be, return to me, and we will praise him\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere they separated; the one to resume his painful duties, the other to\r\nthe little temple, which was close at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho would have told Renzo some moments before, that at the very time of\r\nhis greatest suspense and anxiety, his heart should be divided between\r\nLucy and Don Roderick? And nevertheless it was so. The thought of him\r\nmingled itself with all the bright or painful images which hope or fear\r\ncalled up as he proceeded. The words the friar had uttered by that bed\r\nof pain, blended themselves with the cruel uncertainty of his soul. He\r\ncould not utter a prayer, for the happy issue of his present\r\nundertaking, without adding to it one for the miserable object of his\r\nformer resentment and revenge.\r\n\r\nHe saw the Father Felix on the portico of the church, and by his\r\nattitude comprehended that the holy man was addressing the assembled\r\nconvalescents. He placed himself where he could overlook the audience.\r\nIn the midst were the women, covered with veils; Renzo gazed at them\r\nintently, but finding that, from the place where he stood, it would be a\r\nvain scrutiny, he directed his attention to the father. He was touched\r\nby his venerable figure; and listened with all the attention his own\r\nsolicitude would allow, to the reverend speaker, who thus proceeded in\r\nhis affecting address:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us think for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cof the thousands who have gone\r\nforth thither,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to a gate behind him, leading to the burying\r\nground of San Gregory, which was then but one mighty grave. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us look\r\nat the thousands who remain here, uncertain of their destiny; let us\r\nalso look at ourselves! May the Lord be praised! praised in his justice!\r\npraised in his mercy! praised in death! praised in life! praised in the\r\nchoice he has made of us! Oh! why has he done it, my children, if not to\r\npreserve a people corrected by affliction, and animated by gratitude?\r\nThat we may be deeply sensible that life is his gift, that we may value\r\nit accordingly, and employ it in works which he will approve? That the\r\nremembrance of our sufferings may render us compassionate, and actively\r\nbenevolent to others. May those with whom we have suffered, hoped, and\r\nfeared, and among whom we leave friends and kindred, may they as we pass\r\namidst them derive edification from our deportment! May God preserve us\r\nfrom any exhibition of self-congratulation, or carnal joy, at escaping\r\nthat death against which they are still struggling! May they see us\r\ndepart, rendering thanks to Heaven for ourselves, and praying for them;\r\nthat they may say, _Even beyond these walls they will remember us, they\r\nwill continue to pray for us!_ Let us begin from this moment, from the\r\nfirst step we shall take into the world, a life of charity! Let those\r\nwho have regained their former strength, lend a fraternal arm to the\r\nfeeble; let the young sustain the old; let those who are left without\r\nchildren become parents to the orphan, and thus your sorrows will be\r\nsoftened, and your lives will be acceptable to God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a deep murmur of sighs and sobs, which had been increasing in the\r\nassembly, was suddenly suspended, on seeing the friar place a cord\r\naround his neck and fall on his knees. All was intense attention and\r\nprofound silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand for all my companions, who have been chosen\r\nto the high privilege of serving Christ in you, I humbly ask your\r\nforgiveness if we have not worthily fulfilled so great a ministry. If\r\nindolence, or the waywardness of the flesh, has rendered us less\r\nattentive to your wants, less prompt to your call than duty demanded;\r\nif unjust impatience, or culpable disgust, have caused us sometimes to\r\nappear severe and wearied in your presence; if, indeed, the miserable\r\nthought that you had need of us, has led us to be deficient in humility\r\ntowards you; if our frailty has made us commit any action which may have\r\ngiven you pain, pardon us! May God remit also your offences, and bless\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe have here related, if not the very words, at least the sense of that\r\nwhich he uttered; but we cannot describe the accent which accompanied\r\nthem. It was that of a man who called it a privilege to serve the\r\nafflicted, because he really considered it such; who confessed not to\r\nhave worthily exercised this privilege, because he truly felt his\r\ndeficiency; who asked pardon, because he was persuaded he had need of\r\nit. But his hearers, who had beheld these capuchins only occupied in\r\nserving them, who had beheld so many of them die in the service, and he\r\nwho now spoke in the name of all, always the first in toil as he was the\r\nfirst in authority, his hearers could only answer him with tears. The\r\ngood friar then took a cross which rested against a pillar, and holding\r\nit up before him, took off his sandals, passing through the crowd, which\r\nopened respectfully to give him a passage, and placed himself at their\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nRenzo, overcome with emotion, drew on one side, and placed himself near\r\na cabin, where, half concealed, he awaited, with his eyes open, his\r\nheart palpitating, but with renewed confidence, the result of the\r\nemotion excited by the touching scene of which he had been a witness.\r\n\r\nFather Felix proceeded barefooted at the head of the procession, with\r\nthe cord about his neck, bearing that long and heavy cross; he advanced\r\nslowly but resolutely, as one who would spare the weakness of others,\r\nbut whose ideas of duty enabled him to rise above his own. The largest\r\nchildren followed immediately behind him, for the most part barefooted,\r\nand very few entirely clothed; then came the women, nearly all of them\r\nleading a child, and singing alternately the _miserere_. The feeble\r\nsound of the voices, the paleness and languor of the countenances, would\r\nhave excited commiseration in the heart of a mere spectator. But Renzo\r\nwas occupied with his own peculiar anxieties; the slow progress of the\r\nprocession enabled him to scan with ease every face as it passed. He\r\nlooked and looked again, and always in vain! His eye wandered from rank\r\nto rank, from face to face\xe2\x80\x94they came, they passed\xe2\x80\x94in vain, in\r\nvain\xe2\x80\x94none but unknown features! A new ray of hope dawned upon his mind\r\nas he beheld some cars approaching, in which were the convalescents who\r\nwere still too feeble to support the fatigue of walking. They approached\r\nso slowly that Renzo had full leisure to examine each in turn. But he\r\nwas again disappointed; the cars had all passed, and Father Michael,\r\nwith his staff in his hand, brought up the rear as regulator of the\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThus nearly vanished his hopes, and with them his resolution. His only\r\nground of hope now was to find Lucy still under the power of the\r\ndisease; to this sad and feeble hope, he clung with all the ardour of\r\nhis nature. He fell on his knees at the last step of the temple, and\r\nbreathed forth an unconnected, but fervent prayer; he arose,\r\nstrengthened in hope; and passing the railing pointed out by the father,\r\nentered into the quarter allotted to the women. As he entered it, he saw\r\non the ground one of the little bells that the _monatti_ carried on\r\ntheir feet, with its leather straps attached to it. Thinking it might\r\nserve him as a passport, he tied it to his foot, and then began his\r\npainful search. Here new scenes of sorrow met his eye, similar in part\r\nto those he had already witnessed, partly dissimilar. Under the weight\r\nof the same calamity, he discerned a more patient endurance of pain, and\r\na greater sensibility to the afflictions of others; they to whom bodily\r\nsuffering is a lot and an inheritance, acquire from it fortitude to bear\r\ntheir own woes, and sympathy to bestow on the woes of others.\r\n\r\nRenzo had proceeded some distance on his search, when he heard behind\r\nhim a \xe2\x80\x9cHo!\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared to be addressed to him. Turning, he saw at a\r\ndistance a commissary, who cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGo there into those rooms; they want\r\nyou there; they have not finished carrying all off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo perceived that he took him for a _monatto_, and that the little\r\nbell had caused the mistake. He determined to extricate himself from it\r\nas soon as he could. Making a sign of obedience, he hid himself from the\r\ncommissary, by passing between two cabins which were very near each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAs he stooped to unloose the strap of the little bell, he rested his\r\nhead against the straw wall of one of the cabins; a voice reached his\r\near. O Heaven! is it possible? His whole soul was in his ear, he\r\nscarcely breathed. Yes! yes! it was that voice! \xe2\x80\x9cFear of what?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthat gentle voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have passed through worse dangers than a tempest.\r\nHe who has watched over us until now, will still continue to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo scarcely breathed, his knees trembled, his sight became dim; with\r\na great effort recovering his faculties, he went to the door of the\r\ncabin, and beheld her who had spoken! She was standing, leaning over a\r\nbed; she turned at the sound of his steps, and gazed for a moment\r\nbewildered; at last she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! blessed Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy! I have found you again! I have found you again! It is, indeed,\r\nyou! You live!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Renzo, advancing with trembling steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! blessed Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy, greatly agitated; \xe2\x80\x9cis it indeed you?\r\nHow? Why? the pestilence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had it. And you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have had it also. And my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen her yet; she is at Pasturo. I believe, however, that\r\nshe is well. But you are still suffering! how feeble you appear! you are\r\ncured, however; you are, is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord has seen fit to leave me a little longer here below,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLucy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Renzo! why are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, approaching her, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you ask me why I am here? Must I\r\ntell you? Whom do I think of then? Am I not Renzo? Are you no longer\r\nLucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! why speak thus! Did not my mother write to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! she wrote to me! kind things, truly, to write to a poor\r\nunfortunate man, an exile from his native land, one, at least, who never\r\ninjured you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Renzo! Renzo! since you knew\xe2\x80\x94why come, why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy come! O Lucy! why come, do you say! After so many promises! Are we\r\nno longer the same! Is all forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy, sorrowfully clasping her hands, and raising her\r\neyes to heaven; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didst thou not take me to thyself! O Renzo! what\r\nhave you done! Alas! I hoped\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94that with time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I should have driven\r\nfrom my memory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kind hope indeed! and to say so to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what have you done! in this place! in the midst of these sorrows!\r\nHere, where there is nothing but death, you have dared\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must pray to God for those who die, and trust that they will be\r\nhappy; but their calamity is no reason why those who live must live in\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Renzo! Renzo! you know not what you say; a promise to the Virgin! a\r\nvow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, such promises are good for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! where have you been all this time? with whom have you associated,\r\nthat you speak thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak as a good Christian. I think better of the Virgin than you do,\r\nbecause I do not believe vows to the injury of others are acceptable to\r\nher. If the Virgin had spoken herself, oh! then indeed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94but it is\r\nsimply an idea of your own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you know not what you say; you know not what it is to make a\r\nvow! Leave me, leave me, for the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me at least, tell me, if this reason did not\r\nexist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94would you feel the same towards me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfeeling man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with difficulty restraining her tears;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould it satisfy you to hear me confess that which might be sinful, and\r\nwould certainly be useless! Leave me, oh! leave me! forget me! we were\r\nnot destined for each other. We shall meet again above; we have not\r\nlong to remain in the world. Go! tell my mother that I am cured, that\r\neven here God has assisted me, that I have found a good soul, this\r\nworthy woman who has been a mother to me; tell her we shall meet _when_\r\nit is the will of God, and _as_ it is his will. Go! for the love of\r\nHeaven! and remember me no more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94except when you pray to God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as if wishing to withdraw from the temptation to prolong the\r\nconversation, she drew near the bed where the female was lying of whom\r\nshe had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Lucy, hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, without however approaching her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; go away! for charity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Father Christopher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! where? how do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just spoken with him; a man like him it appears to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here! to assist the afflicted, no doubt. Has he had the plague?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Lucy! I fear, I greatly fear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d As Renzo hesitated to utter his\r\nfears, she had unconsciously again approached him, with a look of\r\nanxious enquiry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI fear he has it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! poor man! But what do I say? poor man! he is rich, rich in the\r\nfavour of God! How is he? Is he confined to his bed? Has he assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, on the contrary, still assisting others\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94but if you were to\r\nsee him! Alas! there can be no mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! is he indeed within these walls?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, and not far off; hardly farther than from your cottage to\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94if you remember\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! most holy Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what he said to me? He said I did well to come in\r\nsearch of you, that God would approve it, and that he would assist me to\r\nfind you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Thus, then, you see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he spoke thus, it was because he did not know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat use would there be in his knowing a mere imagination of your own?\r\nA man of sense, such as he is, never thinks of things of that sort. But\r\noh! Lucy! Shall I tell you what I have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94And he related his\r\nvisit to the cabin.\r\n\r\nLucy, although familiarised in this abode of horrors to spectacles of\r\nwretchedness and despair, was shocked at the recital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the side of that bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cif you could have heard the\r\nholy man! He said, that God has perhaps resolved to look in mercy on\r\nthis unfortunate\xe2\x80\x94(I can now give him no other name)\xe2\x80\x94that he designs to\r\nsubdue him to himself, but that he desires that we should pray together\r\nfor him\xe2\x80\x94together! do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, we will pray each, there where the Lord shall place us. He\r\ncan unite our prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I tell you his very words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Renzo, he does not know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can you not comprehend, when such a man speaks, it is God who\r\nspeaks in him, and that he would not have spoken thus, if it ought not\r\nto be exactly so? And the soul of this unfortunate! I have prayed, and\r\nwill pray for him; I have prayed with all my heart, as if he were my\r\nbrother. But what, think you, will be his condition in the other world,\r\nif we do not repair some of the evil he has done? If you return to\r\nreason, all will be set in order. That which has been, has been\xe2\x80\x94he has\r\nhad his punishment here below\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Renzo, no! God would not have us do evil that good may come. Leave\r\nto him the care of this unfortunate man; our duty is to pray for him. If\r\nI had died that fatal night, would not God have been able to pardon him?\r\nAnd if I am not dead, if I have been delivered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your mother, poor Agnes, who desired so much to see us man and\r\nwife, has she not told you it was a foolish imagination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother! think you my mother would advise me to break a vow? Would\r\nyou desire that she should? But, Renzo, you are not in your right mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you women cannot be made to comprehend reason! Father Christopher\r\ntold me to return, and inform him whether I had found you\xe2\x80\x94I will go,\r\nand get his advice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, go to the holy man! Tell him I pray for him, and that I\r\ndesire his prayers! But, for the love of Heaven! for your soul\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nand for mine, do not return here, to trouble, to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94tempt me! Father\r\nChristopher will explain matters to you, and make you return to\r\nyourself; he will set your heart at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart at rest! Oh! don\xe2\x80\x99t encourage an idea of that sort! You have,\r\nbefore now, caused such language to be written to me! and the suffering\r\nit caused me! and now you have the heart to tell it to me! As for me, I\r\ndeclare to you plainly, that I will never set my heart at rest. Lucy!\r\nyou have told me to forget you; forget you! how can I do it? After so\r\nmany trials! so many promises! Who have I thought of ever since we\r\nparted? Is it because I have suffered, that you treat me thus? because I\r\nhave been unfortunate? because the world has persecuted me? because I\r\nhave been so long away from you? because the first moment I was able, I\r\ncame to seek you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! holy Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucy, as the tears flowed from her eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome to my help. You have aided me hitherto; aid me now. Since that\r\nnight such a moment as this have I never passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lucy, you do well to invoke the Virgin. She is the mother of\r\ncompassion, and will take no pleasure in our sufferings. But, if this is\r\nan excuse\xe2\x80\x94if I have become odious to you\xe2\x80\x94tell me, speak frankly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor pity, Renzo, for pity, stop\xe2\x80\x94stop. Do not make me die. Go to Father\r\nChristopher; commend me to him. Do not return here\xe2\x80\x94do not return here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go, but think not I will not return. I would return from the end of\r\nthe world; yes, I would return!\xe2\x80\x9d and he disappeared.\r\n\r\nLucy threw herself on the floor near the bed, upon which she rested her\r\nhead, and wept bitterly. The good woman, who had been a silent spectator\r\nof the painful scene, demanded the cause of her anguish and her tears?\r\nBut, perhaps, the reader will wish to know something of this benevolent\r\nperson: we will satisfy the desire in a few words.\r\n\r\nShe was a rich tradeswoman, about thirty years of age: she had beheld\r\nher husband and children die of the plague. Attacked by it herself, she\r\nhad been brought to the lazaretto, and placed in the cabin with Lucy,\r\nwho was just beginning to recover her senses, which had forsaken her\r\nfrom the commencement of her attack in the house of Don Ferrante. The\r\nhumble roof could only accommodate two guests, and there grew up, in\r\ntheir affliction, a strict and intimate friendship between them. They\r\nderived great consolation from each other\xe2\x80\x99s society, and had pledged\r\nthemselves not to separate, after quitting the lazaretto. The good\r\nwoman, whose wealth was now far more ample than were her desires, wished\r\nto retain Lucy with her as a daughter: the proposition was received with\r\ngratitude, and accepted, on condition of the permission and approval of\r\nAgnes. Lucy had, however, never made known to her the circumstances of\r\nher intended marriage, and her other extraordinary adventures; but now\r\nshe related, as distinctly as tears permitted her to do so, her sad\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Renzo went in search of Father Christopher: he found him with\r\nno small difficulty, and engaged in administering consolation to a dying\r\nman. The scene was soon closed. The father remained a short time in\r\nsilent prayer. He then arose, and seeing Renzo approach, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is there; I have found her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what state?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvalescent, and out of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is another difficulty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94you know how good this poor girl is; but she is\r\nsometimes a little fanciful. After so many promises, she tells me now\r\nshe cannot marry me, because on that night of fear she made a vow to the\r\nVirgin! These things signify nothing, do they? Is it not true that they\r\nare not binding, at least on people such as we are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she far from this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; a few steps beyond the church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give her to understand that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not, my son: I must hear what she will say.\xe2\x80\x9d And they proceeded\r\nto Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.\r\n\r\nThe clouds were gathering in the heavens, and a tempest coming on. Rapid\r\nlightning, cleaving the increasing darkness, illumined at moments the\r\nlong roofs and arcades of the building, and the cupola of the little\r\nchurch: loud claps of thunder resounded with prolonged echoes through\r\nthe heavens. Renzo suppressed his impatience, and accommodated his steps\r\nto the strength of the father, who, exhausted by fatigue, oppressed by\r\ndisease, and breathing in pain, could, with difficulty, drag his failing\r\nlimbs to the performance of this last act of benevolence.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the door of the cabin, Renzo stopped, saying, in a\r\ntrembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is there!\xe2\x80\x9d They entered. Lucy arose, and ran\r\ntowards the old man, crying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what I do see! Oh, Father\r\nChristopher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lucy! through how much peril has God preserved you! you must be\r\nrejoiced that you have always trusted in Him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes.\xe2\x80\x94But you, my father! how you are changed! how do you feel?\r\nsay, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs God wills, and as, through his grace, I will also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nfriar, with a serene countenance. Drawing her aside, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHear me,\r\nI have but a few moments to spare. Are you disposed to confide in me, as\r\nin times past?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, are you not still my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my child, what is this vow of which Renzo speaks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a vow I made to the Virgin never to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did you forget that you were bound by a previous promise? God, my\r\ndaughter, accepts of offerings from that which is our own. It is the\r\nheart he desires, the will; but you cannot offer the will of another to\r\nwhom you had pledged yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, poor child, think not so; I believe the holy Virgin has accepted\r\nthe intention of your afflicted heart, and has offered it to God for\r\nyou. But tell me, did you ask the advice of any one about this matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not deem it a sin, or I would have confessed it, and the little\r\ngood one does, one ought not to mention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no other motive for preventing the fulfilment of your promise\r\nto Renzo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94for myself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94what motive?\xe2\x80\x94no other,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lucy, with\r\na hesitation which implied any thing rather than uncertainty; and a\r\nblush passed over her pale and lovely countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat God has given the church\r\nauthority to remit the obligations that man may have contracted to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn, then, that the care of souls in this place, being committed to\r\nus, we have the most ample powers from the church; and I can, if you ask\r\nit, free you from the obligation you have contracted by this vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not a sin to repent of a promise made to the Virgin?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLucy, violently agitated by unexpected hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSin, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9csin, to recur to the church, and to\r\nask her minister to use the authority which he has received from her,\r\nand which she receives from God! I bless him that he has given me,\r\nunworthy that I am, the power to speak in his name, and to restore to\r\nyou your vow. If you ask me to absolve you from it, I shall not hesitate\r\nto do so; and I even hope you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94I ask it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, with a modest confidence.\r\n\r\nThe friar beckoned to Renzo, who was watching the progress of the\r\ndialogue with the deepest solicitude, to approach, and said aloud to\r\nLucy, \xe2\x80\x9cWith the authority I hold from the church, I declare you absolved\r\nfrom your vow, and liberate you from all the obligations you may have\r\ncontracted by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine the feelings of Renzo at these words. His eyes\r\nexpressed the warmth of his gratitude to him who had uttered them; but\r\nthey sought in vain for Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn in peace and safety to your former attachment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember, my son, that in giving you this companion, the\r\nchurch does it not to insure simply your temporal happiness, but to\r\nprepare you both for happiness without end. Thank Heaven that you have\r\nbeen brought to this state through misery and affliction: your joy will\r\nbe the more temperate and durable. If God should grant you children,\r\nbring them up in his fear, and in love to all men\xe2\x80\x94for the rest you\r\ncannot greatly err. And now, Lucy, has Renzo told you whom he has beheld\r\nin this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father, he has told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will pray for him, and for me also, my children. You will remember\r\nyour poor friar?\xe2\x80\x9d And drawing from his basket a small wooden box,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin this box are the remains of the loaf\xe2\x80\x94the first I asked for\r\ncharity\xe2\x80\x94the loaf of which you have heard; I leave it to you; show it to\r\nyour children; they will come into a wicked world; they will meet the\r\nproud and insolent. Tell them always to forgive, always! every thing,\r\nevery thing! And let them pray for the poor friar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucy took the box from his hands with reverence, and he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ntell me what you mean to do here at Milan? and who will conduct you to\r\nyour mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis good lady has been a mother to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall leave\r\nthis place together, and she will provide for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God bless her!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, approaching the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay he bestow his blessing upon you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the joy you\r\nhave given to the afflicted, although it disappoints my hope of having\r\nLucy as a companion. But I will accompany her to her village, and\r\nrestore her to her mother, and,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give\r\nthe outfit. I have much wealth, and of those who should have enjoyed it\r\nwith me none are left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe service will be acceptable to God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has\r\nwatched over you both in affliction. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, turning to Renzo,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe must begone; I have remained too long already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I see you again? I have recovered\r\nfrom this dreadful disease, I who am of no use in the world; and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man with a serious and gentle tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked a great favour from Heaven; that of ending my days in the\r\nservice of my fellow-men. If God grants it to me now, all those who love\r\nme should help me to return him thanks. And now give Renzo your\r\ncommissions for your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy to her betrothed; \xe2\x80\x9ctell her I have found here\r\nanother mother, and that we will come to her as soon as we possibly\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have need of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cI have here all that you\r\nsent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cI have more than sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, Lucy, and you, too, good signora, till we meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRenzo, not having words to express his feelings at this moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows whether we shall all meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God ever watch over you and bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, as he\r\nquitted the cabin with Renzo.\r\n\r\nAs night was not far distant, the capuchin offered the young man a\r\nshelter in his humble abode: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot bear you company,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou can at least repose yourself, in order to be able to prosecute your\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo, however, felt impatient to be gone; as to the hour or the weather\r\nit might be said that, night or day, rain or shine, heat or cold, were\r\nequally indifferent to him; the friar pressed his hand as he departed,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you find, which may God grant! the good Agnes, remember me\r\nto her; tell her, as well as all those who remember Friar Christopher,\r\nto pray for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear father, shall we never meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove, I hope. Farewell, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Renzo passed without the walls of the lazaretto, the rain began to\r\nfall in torrents. Instead of lamenting, he rejoiced at it: he was\r\ndelighted with the refreshing air, and with the sound of the falling\r\ndrops from the plants and foliage which seemed to have new life imparted\r\nto them; and breathing more freely in this change of nature, he felt\r\nmore vividly the change that had occurred in his own destiny.\r\n\r\nBut much would his enjoyment have been increased, could he have surmised\r\nwhat would be seen a few days after. This water carried off, washed\r\naway, so to speak, the contagion. If the lazaretto did not restore to\r\nthe living all the living it still contained, at least from that day it\r\nreceived no more into its vast abyss. At the end of a week, shops were\r\nopened, people returned to their houses, quarantine was hardly spoken\r\nof, and there remained of the pestilence but a few scattered traces.\r\n\r\nOur traveller proceeded on full of joy, without having thought _where_\r\nor _when_ he should stop for the night; anxious only to go forward to\r\nreach the village, and to proceed immediately to Pasturo in search of\r\nAgnes. In the midst of the reminiscences of the horrors and the dangers\r\nof the day, there was always present the thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have found her! she\r\nis well! she is mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then again he recalled his doubts, his difficulties, his fears, his\r\nhopes, that had agitated him that eventful morning! He fancied himself\r\nwith his hand on the knocker of Don Ferrante\xe2\x80\x99s house! And the\r\nunfavourable answer! And then those fools who were about to attack him\r\nin their madness! And the lazaretto, that vast sepulchre! To have\r\nhurried thither to find her, and to have found her! And the procession!\r\nWhat a moment! And now it appeared nothing to him! And the quarter set\r\napart for the women! And there, behind that cabin when he least\r\nexpected it, that voice! that voice itself! And to see her there! But\r\nthen her vow! It exists no longer. And his violent hatred against Don\r\nRoderick, which had augmented his grief, and shed its venom over his\r\nhopes! That also was gone. Indeed, had it not been for his uncertainty\r\nconcerning Agnes, his anxiety about Father Christopher, and the\r\nconsciousness that the pestilence still existed, his happiness would\r\nhave been without alloy.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Sesto in the evening; the rain had as yet no appearance of\r\nceasing. But Renzo did not stop, his only inconvenience was an\r\nextraordinary appetite, which the vicinity of a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop enabled him\r\nto mitigate the violence of. When he passed through Monza it was dark\r\nnight; he succeeded, however, in leaving it by the right road; but what\r\na road! buried between two banks, almost like the bed of a river, it\r\nmight then, indeed, have been called a river, or rather, an aqueduct; in\r\nnumerous places were deep holes, from which Renzo could with difficulty\r\nextricate himself. But he did as well as he could, without impatience or\r\nregret. He reflected that every step brought him nearer to the end of\r\nhis journey; that the rain would cease when God should please; that day\r\nwould come in its own time; and that in the mean time the road he had\r\npassed over he should not have to travel again. At the break of day he\r\nfound himself near the Adda. It had not ceased raining; there was still\r\na drizzling shower; the light of the dawn enabled Renzo to see around\r\nhim. He was in his own country! Who can express his sensations? Those\r\nmountains, the _Resegone_, the territory of Lecco, appeared to belong to\r\nhim, to be his own! But, looking at himself, he felt that his outward\r\naspect was rather at variance with the exuberant joyousness of his\r\nheart; his clothes were wet and clinging to his body, his hat bent out\r\nof shape and full of water; his hair hanging straight about his face;\r\nwhile his lower man was encased in a dense covering of mud.\r\n\r\nHe reached Pescate; travelled along the Adda, giving a melancholy glance\r\nat Pescarenico; passed the bridge, and crossed the fields, to the house\r\nof his friend, who, just risen, was at the door, looking out upon the\r\nweather. He beheld the strange figure, covered with mud, and wet to the\r\nskin, and yet, so joyous and animated! in his life he had never seen a\r\nman, so accoutred, appear so satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9calready here! and in such weather! How have things gone\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is there! she is there! she is there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell and safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvalescent, which is better! I have wonderful things to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what a state you are in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty pickle indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth you might squeeze water enough from your upper half to wash\r\naway the mud from the lower. But wait a moment; I will make a fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to feel its warmth, I assure you. Do you know where the\r\nrain overtook me? Precisely at the door of the lazaretto; but no matter,\r\nthe weather does its business, and I mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend soon kindled a bright blaze. \xe2\x80\x9cNow do me another favour,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRenzo, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me the bundle I left above; for before my clothes dry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReturning with the bundle, his friend said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be hungry; you\r\nhave had drink enough, no doubt, on the way, but as to eating\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought two loaves yesterday at dusk, but truly, I have not eaten\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will provide for you.\xe2\x80\x9d He poured some water in a kettle which\r\nhung over the fire, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and milk the cow, and when I\r\nreturn with the milk, the water will be ready, and we will have a good\r\n_polenta_. You, in the mean while, change your clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d After having\r\nallowed him time to perform the troublesome operation, his friend\r\nreturned, and commenced making the _polenta_. \xe2\x80\x9cI have much to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were to see Milan! and the lazaretto! She is there!\r\nyou will soon see her here; she will be my wife; you shall be at the\r\nwedding, and, pestilence or not, we will be happy for a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Renzo set out for Pasturo. On his arrival, he\r\nasked concerning Agnes, and learnt that she was in health and safety. He\r\napproached her residence, which had been pointed out to him, and called\r\nher by name from the street. At the sound of his voice, she rushed to\r\nthe window, and Renzo, without allowing her time to speak, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\r\nis well; I saw her the day before yesterday; she will be at home\r\nshortly; oh, I have so many things to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOvercome by various emotions, Agnes could only articulate, \xe2\x80\x9cI will open\r\nthe door for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not had the plague, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you ought to be prudent. I come from Milan; and have been for\r\ntwo days in the midst of it. It is true I have changed my clothes, but\r\nthe contagion attaches itself to the flesh, like witchcraft; and since\r\nGod has preserved you until now, you must take care of yourself until\r\nall danger is over; for you are our mother, and I trust we shall live\r\nlong together as a compensation for the sufferings we have endured, _I_\r\nat least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no longer any _but_; I know what you would say. You will soon\r\nsee there is no longer any _but_; come into the open air, where I may\r\nspeak to you in safety, and I will tell you all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgnes pointed to a garden adjoining the house. Renzo entered it, and was\r\nimmediately joined by the anxious and impatient Agnes. They seated\r\nthemselves opposite each other on two benches. The events he described\r\nare already known to our reader, and we will leave to his imagination\r\nthe numerous exclamations of grief, horror, surprise, and joy, that\r\ninterrupted the progress of the narrative every moment. The result,\r\nhowever, was an agreement to settle all together at Bergamo, where Renzo\r\nhad already an advantageous engagement; _when_ would depend on the\r\npestilence and other circumstances; Agnes was to remain where she was,\r\nuntil it should be safe for her to return home; and in the interval she\r\nshould have regular information of all their movements.\r\n\r\nHe departed, with the additional consolation of having found one so dear\r\nto him safe and well. He remained the rest of that day and the following\r\nnight with his friend, and on the morrow set out for the country of his\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nHe found Bortolo in good health, and in less apprehension of losing it,\r\nas within a few days things had rapidly changed for the better. The\r\nmalignity of the distemper had subsided, and given place to fever\r\nindeed, accompanied with tumours, but much more easily cured. The\r\ncountry presented a new aspect; those who had survived the pestilence\r\nbegan to resume their business; masters were preparing for the\r\nemployment of workmen in every trade; and, above all, in that of weaving\r\nsilk. Renzo made some preparations for the accommodation of his family,\r\nby purchasing and furnishing a neat little cottage, from his hitherto\r\nuntouched treasure, which the ravages of the plague enabled him to do at\r\nsmall cost.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days\xe2\x80\x99 stay, he returned by the way of Pasturo, and conducted\r\nAgnes to her village home: we will not attempt to describe her feelings\r\nat beholding again those well remembered places. She found all things in\r\nher cottage as she had left them: it seemed as if angels had watched\r\nover the poor widow and her child. Her first care was to get ready with\r\nall speed an apartment in her humble abode for that kind friend who had\r\nbeen to her child a second mother. Renzo, on his side, was not idle. He\r\nlaboured alternately at the widow\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and in the service of his\r\nhospitable friend. As to his own cottage, it pained him to witness the\r\nscene of desolation it presented; and he resolved to dispose of it, and\r\ntransfer its value to his new country. His re-appearance in the village\r\nwas a cause of much congratulation to those who had survived the plague.\r\nAll were anxious to learn his adventures, which had given rise to so\r\nmany reports among the neighbours. As to Don Abbondio, he exhibited the\r\nsame apprehension of the marriage as before; the mention of which\r\nconjured up to his affrighted fancy the dreaded Don Roderick and his\r\ntrain on the one side, and the almost equally feared cardinal and his\r\narguments on the other.\r\n\r\nWe will now transport the reader for a few moments to Milan. Some days\r\nafter the visit of Renzo to the lazaretto, Lucy left it with the good\r\nwidow. A general quarantine having been ordered, they passed the period\r\nof it together in the house of the latter. The time was employed in\r\npreparing Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s wedding clothes; and, the quarantine terminated, they\r\nset off on their journey. We could add, _they arrived_, but,\r\nnotwithstanding our desire to yield to the impatience of the reader,\r\nthere are three circumstances which we must not pass over in silence.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that while Lucy was relating her adventures more minutely\r\nto the good widow, she recurred to the signora, who had afforded her an\r\nasylum, in the convent of Monza, and in return learnt many things which\r\nafforded her the solution to numerous mysteries, and filled her with\r\nsorrow and astonishment. She learnt, too, that the unfortunate signora,\r\nfalling afterwards under the most horrible suspicions, had been, by\r\norder of the cardinal, transferred to a convent at Milan; that there,\r\nafter having given herself up for a time to rage and despair, she had at\r\nlast made her confession and repented of her crimes; and that her\r\npresent life was one of severe and voluntary penance. If any one desires\r\nto know the details of her sad history, it will be found in the author\r\nwe have so often quoted.[36]\r\n\r\n      [36] Ripamonti.\r\n\r\nThe second is, that Lucy, making enquiries concerning Father\r\nChristopher, of every capuchin from the lazaretto, learnt with more\r\ngrief than surprise that he had died of the pestilence.\r\n\r\nAnd the third is, that before quitting Milan, Lucy had a desire to know\r\nsomething concerning her former patrons. The widow accompanied her to\r\ntheir house, where they were informed that both had died of the plague.\r\nWhen we say of Donna Prassede she _died_, we have said all that is\r\nnecessary; not so with Don Ferrante, he deserves a little more of our\r\nattention, considering his learning.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the pestilence, Don Ferrante was one of the\r\nmost resolute in denying its existence, not indeed like the multitude,\r\nwith cries of rage, but with arguments which none could accuse of want\r\nof concatenation. \xe2\x80\x9cIn _rerum natura_,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are but two\r\nkinds of things, substances and accidents; and if I prove that the\r\ncontagion can neither be one nor the other of these I shall have proved\r\nthat it does not exist; that it is a chimera. Thus, then: substances are\r\neither material or spiritual; that the contagion is a spiritual\r\nsubstance, is so absurd an opinion, that no one would presume to advance\r\nit; it is, then, useless to speak of it. Material substances are either\r\nsimple or compound. Now, the contagion is not a simple substance, and I\r\nwill prove it in three words. It is not an aerial substance, because, if\r\nit were, instead of passing from one body to another, it would fly off\r\nto its sphere; it is not a watery substance, because it would be dried\r\nup by the wind; it is not igneous, because it would burn; it is not\r\nearthy, because it would be visible. Moreover, it is not a compound\r\nsubstance, because it would be sensible to the eye, or to the touch; and\r\nwho has seen it? or touched it? It remains to see if it be an accident.\r\nThis is still less probable. The doctors say it is communicated from\r\nbody to body; this is their Achilles; the pretext for so many useless\r\nregulations. Now, supposing it an accident, it would be a transferable\r\naccident, which is an incongruity. There is not in all philosophy a more\r\nevident thing than this, that an accident cannot pass from one subject\r\nto another; so if, to avoid this Scylla, they are reduced to call it an\r\naccident produced, they avoid Scylla by falling into Charybdis, because\r\nif it be produced, it does not communicate itself, it does not\r\npropagate, as they declare. These principles allowed, what is the use of\r\ntalking of botches and carbuncles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is folly,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his hearers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Don Ferrante, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say so. Science is science; we\r\nmust only know how to employ it. Swellings, purple botches, and black\r\ncarbuncles, are respectable terms, which have a good and proper\r\nsignification; but I say they have nothing to do with the question. Who\r\ndenies that there may be and are such things? We must only prove whence\r\nthey come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere began the vexations of Don Ferrante. So long as he laughed at the\r\ncontagion, he found respectful and attentive listeners; but when he came\r\nto distinguish and demonstrate that the error of the doctors was, not in\r\naffirming that there existed a general and terrible disease, but rather\r\nin assigning its cause, then he found them intractable and rebellious,\r\nthen he no longer dared expose his doctrine, but by shreds and patches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the true reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand those even who maintain other\r\nfancies are obliged to acknowledge it. Let them deny, if they can, that\r\nthere is a fatal conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. And when has it been\r\nsaid that influences propagate? And would these gentlemen deny the\r\nexistence of influences? Will they say there are no planets? or will\r\nthey say that they keep up above, doing nothing, as so many pins in a\r\npincushion? But that which I cannot understand from these doctors is,\r\nthat they confess we are under so malign a conjunction, and then they\r\ntell us, don\xe2\x80\x99t touch this, don\xe2\x80\x99t touch that, and you will be safe! as\r\nif, in avoiding the material contact of terrestrial bodies, we could\r\nprevent the virtual effect of celestial bodies. And such a work in\r\nburning rags! Poor people! will you burn Jupiter? will you burn Saturn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_His fretus_, that is to say, on these grounds, he took no precautions\r\nagainst the pestilence; he caught it, and died, like Metastasio\xe2\x80\x99s hero,\r\ncomplaining of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine evening Agnes heard a carriage drive up to the door of her\r\ncottage. It was Lucy and the good widow. We can easily imagine the joy\r\nof the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Renzo made his appearance, at an early hour,\r\nlittle expecting to find Lucy with her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Renzo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Lucy, with downcast eyes, and in a tone\xe2\x80\x94oh how different from that\r\nwith which she addressed all besides! Renzo was conscious that it was\r\nmeant for him alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am always well when I see you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur poor Father Christopher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9cpray for his soul, although\r\nwe may be almost sure he is now in heaven, praying for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected no less,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI expected to hear that he\r\nwas taken away from this world of sorrow and trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sadness of their recollections, joy was the\r\npredominant feeling of their hearts. The good widow was an agreeable\r\naddition to the little company. When Renzo saw her in the miserable\r\ncabin at the lazaretto, he could not have believed her to be of so\r\nfacile and gay a disposition; but the lazaretto and the country, death\r\nand a wedding, are not at all the same things. During the evening Renzo\r\nleft them, for the purpose of visiting the curate. \xe2\x80\x9cSignor Curate,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, with a respectful but jocular air, \xe2\x80\x9cthe headache, which, you said,\r\nprevented you from marrying us, has it passed off? The bride is here,\r\nand I am come to have you appoint an hour, but, I pray you, not to let\r\nit be far distant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Abbondio did not say he would not; but he began to offer excuses and\r\ninsinuations. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy come forward into public view with this order for his\r\napprehension hanging over him? and the thing could be easily done\r\nelsewhere, and then this, and then that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have still a little pain in your head,\r\nbut listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And he described the state in which he had seen Don\r\nRoderick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has nothing to do with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I say no to\r\nyou? However, while there is life there is hope, you know. Look at me; I\r\nhave also been nearer the other world than this, and here I am\r\nnevertheless; and if new troubles do not fall upon me, I hope to remain\r\nhere a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was prolonged some time, without coming to any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, and Renzo returned home to relate it. \xe2\x80\x9cI came\r\noff,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I feared I should lose all patience. At times he\r\nbehaved exactly as he did before, and I verily believe if I had remained\r\na little longer, he would have spoken Latin again. I see that all this\r\nportends a tedious business. It would be better to do as he says, and go\r\nand be married where we intend to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see what we can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps he will be\r\nmore tractable to the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed this advice, and in the afternoon proceeded to the\r\nparsonage. The curate evinced much pleasure on seeing Lucy and Agnes,\r\nand much politeness towards the stranger. He endeavoured to divert the\r\ndiscourse from that which he knew to be the purport of their visit. He\r\nbegged from Lucy a recital of all her woes, and availed himself of the\r\naccount of the lazaretto to draw the stranger into the conversation. He\r\nthen expatiated on his own miseries, which he detailed at full length.\r\nThe pause so long watched for came at last. One of the widows broke the\r\nice; but Don Abbondio was no longer the same man; he did not say _no_;\r\nbut he returned to his doubts and his difficulties, jumping like a bird\r\nfrom branch to branch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto get free\r\nfrom this unlucky order. You, signora, who live at Milan, you ought to\r\nknow the course of these things; if we had the protection of some\r\npowerful man, all wounds would be healed. After all, the shortest way\r\nwould be to have the ceremony performed where these young people are\r\ngoing, and where this proscription cannot affect them. Here, with this\r\norder, which is known to every one, to utter from the altar the name of\r\nLorenzo Tramaglino is a thing I should be very unwilling to do. I wish\r\nhim too well; it would be rendering him an ill service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Agnes and the widow were endeavouring to reply to these reasons,\r\nwhich the subtle curate as often reproduced under another form, Renzo\r\nentered the room, with the air of one bringing important intelligence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Marquis *** has arrived!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? arrived! where?\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has arrived at his castle, which was Don Roderick\xe2\x80\x99s: he is the heir\r\nby feoffment of trust, as they say. So that there is no longer a doubt\r\non the subject. And as to the marquis, he is a most worthy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9cI have often heard him spoken of as an\r\nexcellent lord. But is it really true that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you believe your sexton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he saw him with his own eyes. Will you hear Ambrose? I made him\r\nwait without expressly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenzo called the sexton, who confirmed the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he is dead then! he is really gone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\r\nmy children, the hand of Providence. It is a happy thing for this poor\r\ncountry: we could not live with this man. The plague has been a great\r\nscourge, but it has also been, as it were, a serviceable broom; it has\r\nswept off certain people, of whom, my children, we could never have\r\ndelivered ourselves. In the twinkling of an eye they have disappeared by\r\nthe hundred. We shall no longer see him wandering about with that\r\nhaughty air, followed by his cut throats, and looking at every body as\r\nif they were all placed on earth for his pleasure. He is gone, and we\r\nare still here! He will send no more messages to honest people. He has\r\nmade us all pass a sad life; and now we are at liberty to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pardon him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cwith all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you do well; it is your duty; but we may also thank Heaven for\r\ndelivering us from him. Now, if you wish to be married, I am ready. As\r\nto the _order for your seizure_, that is of little importance; the\r\nplague has carried off that too. If you choose\xe2\x80\x94to-day is Thursday\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nSunday, I will publish the banns, and then I shall have the happiness of\r\nuniting you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know we came for that purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; and I will send word of it to his Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is his Eminence?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Eminence? our lord cardinal archbishop, whom may God preserve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, you are mistaken; I can tell you they do not call him\r\nso, because the second time we went to speak with him, one of the\r\npriests drew me aside, and told me I must call him your illustrious\r\nlordship, and my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, if that same priest were to tell you, he would say you must\r\ncall him _Your Eminence_; the pope has ordered, that this title be given\r\nto the cardinals. And do you know why? Because _Most Illustrious_ was\r\nassumed by so many people who had no right to it. By and by, they will\r\ncall the bishops _Your Eminence_, then the abbots will claim it, then\r\nthe canons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the curates,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, let the curates alone for that; they will be only _Your\r\nReverence_ to the end of the world. But to return to our affairs. On\r\nSunday, I will publish the banns at the church, and obtain, in the mean\r\ntime, a dispensation for omitting the two other publications. There will\r\nbe plenty of similar applications, if things go on elsewhere as they do\r\nhere; the fire has taken; no one will wish to live alone, I imagine; I\r\nhave already three marriages on hand besides yours; what a pity Perpetua\r\nis dead, she might find a husband! And at Milan, signora, I imagine it\r\nis the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed. In my parish alone there were fifty marriages last\r\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the world wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t end yet. And you, signora, has no butterfly\r\nbegun to fly around you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I think not of it; I do not mean to think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes; would you be alone indeed? Agnes also, Agnes also\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a mind to jest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agnes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I have; it is high time. We may hope that the few days that\r\nremain to us will be less sad. As for me, poor old man! there is no\r\nremedy for years, as they say, _Senectus ipsa est morbus_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may speak Latin as much as you like; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare about it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou still quarrel with Latin, do you? Well, I will not forget you. When\r\nyou come before me with Lucy, to pronounce some little words in Latin, I\r\nwill say to you, You do not like Latin, go in peace. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it is not that Latin I dislike, pure and holy like that of the\r\nmass; I speak of the Latin which falls on one as a traitor, in the very\r\nmidst of conversation. For example, now that we are here, and all is\r\npast, the Latin you spoke there, in that corner, to make me understand\r\nthat you could not, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94I know not what. Tell me now in language I\r\ncan understand, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! you mischievous fellow, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Abbondio. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not stir up\r\nold grievances: if we were to settle our accounts, I do not know which\r\nof us would be in debt to the other. I have forgiven you, but you also\r\nplayed me an ill turn. As for you, it did not astonish me, because you\r\nare a good-for-nothing fellow; but I speak of this silent\xe2\x80\x94this little\r\nsaint; one would have thought it a sin to distrust her. But I know who\r\nadvised her; I know I do,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, pointing to Agnes.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the change which had come over him. His\r\nmind, so long the slave of continual apprehension, was now emancipated\r\nfrom its fetters, and his tongue, liberated from its bonds, recurred to\r\nits former habits. He playfully prolonged the conversation, even\r\nfollowing them to the door, with some parting jest.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Don Abbondio received a visit, as agreeable as it\r\nwas unexpected, from the lord marquis, whose appearance confirmed all\r\nthat report had said of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI come,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto bring you the\r\nsalutations of the cardinal archbishop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what condescension in both of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I took leave of that incomparable man, who honours me with his\r\nfriendship, he spoke to me of two young people of this parish who have\r\nsuffered much from the unfortunate Don Roderick. My lord wishes to hear\r\nof them. Are they living? Are their affairs settled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir affairs are settled; and I had thought of writing to his Eminence\r\nabout it, but now that I have the honour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and as soon as possible, they will be man and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI request you to tell me what I can do for them, and the best manner of\r\ndoing it. You will render me a service by enabling me to dispose of some\r\nof my superfluous wealth for their benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Heaven reward you! I thank you in the name of my children,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Abbondio; \xe2\x80\x9cand since your lordship allows me, I have an expedient to\r\nsuggest which perhaps will not displease you. These good people have\r\nresolved to establish themselves elsewhere, and to sell the little that\r\nbelongs to them here. The best charity you can render them, is to buy\r\ntheir property, as otherwise it will be sold for little or nothing. But\r\nyour lordship will decide, I have spoken in obedience to your commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis thanked Don Abbondio, telling him he should leave it to him\r\nto fix the price, and to do so entirely to their advantage, as it was an\r\nobject with him to make the amount as large as possible. He then\r\nproposed that they should go together to the cottage of Lucy.\r\n\r\nOn their way, Don Abbondio, quite overjoyed continued the\r\nconversation,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSince your lordship is so disposed to benefit this\r\npeople, there is another service you can render them. The young man has\r\nan order for his apprehension out against him, for some folly he\r\ncommitted two years ago at Milan, on the day of the great Tumult. A\r\nrecommendation, a word, from a man like yourself, might hereafter be of\r\nservice to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there not heavy charges against him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey made a great deal of noise about it; but really there was nothing\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; I will take it upon myself to free him from all\r\nembarrassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe may imagine the surprise of our little company, at a visit from such\r\na guest. He entered agreeably into conversation with them and after a\r\nwhile, made his proposal. Don Abbondio, being requested by him to fix\r\nthe price, did so; the purchaser said he was well satisfied, and, if he\r\nhad not understood him, in repeating it, doubled the sum. He would not\r\nhear of rectifying the mistake, and ended the conversation by inviting\r\nthe company to dinner the day after the wedding, when the affair could\r\nbe settled with every necessary formality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Don Abbondio when he returned home, \xe2\x80\x9cif the pestilence\r\nacted everywhere with so much discrimination, it would be a pity to\r\nspeak ill of it. We should want one every generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe happy day at length arrived. The betrothed went to the church where\r\nthey were united by Don Abbondio. The day after, the wedding party made\r\ntheir visit at the castle. We will leave the reader to imagine their\r\nreflections on entering those walls! In the midst of their joy,\r\nhowever, they felt that the presence of the good Father Christopher was\r\nwanting to complete it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, \xe2\x80\x9che is even happier than we\r\nare, assuredly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contract was drawn up by a doctor, but not _Azzecca Garbugli_! He\r\nwas gone to _Canterelli_. For those who are not of this country, an\r\nexplanation of this expression may be necessary.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile above Lecco, and nearly on the borders of the other\r\nterritory, called Castello, is _Canterelli_. This was a spot where two\r\nroads cross. Near the point of junction there is a small eminence, an\r\nartificial hill, surmounted by a cross. This was a heap of bodies, dead\r\nof this epidemic. It is true, tradition simply says, _the dead of the\r\nepidemic_; but it must have been this one, as it was the last, and most\r\nsevere within the memory of man: and we know that tradition says very\r\nlittle of itself, unless we render it some assistance.\r\n\r\nOn their return, no other inconvenience was felt, than the weight of the\r\nmoney which Renzo had to sustain. However, he did not look upon this as\r\none of the greatest hardships he had had to encounter. There was,\r\nhowever, one matter which perplexed him not a little. How should he\r\nemploy it? Should it be in agriculture? Should it be in business? Or why\r\nchoose at all? Were not both in turn, like one\xe2\x80\x99s legs, better than\r\neither singly?\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, Did they feel no regrets on quitting their native\r\nvillage\xe2\x80\x94their native mountains? Don Roderick and his wretched agents\r\ncould no longer disturb them. Regrets they did feel; but the old\r\nrecollections of happiness enjoyed amidst its scenes, had been greatly\r\nweakened by recent distresses and apprehensions, and new hopes had\r\narisen connected with their new country; so that they could look to\r\ntheir change of abode without any feelings of grief.\r\n\r\nThe little company now thought only of preparing for their journey,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n_Tramaglino_ family to their new country, and the widow to Milan. Many\r\ntears were shed, many thanks given, and many promises to meet again. The\r\nseparation of Renzo and the friend who had treated him so hospitably,\r\nwas not less tender. Neither did they part coldly from Don Abbondio:\r\nthey had always preserved a certain respect for their curate, and he, in\r\nhis heart, had always wished them well. It is these unfortunate affairs\r\nof the world which perplex our affections. But who would believe that,\r\nin this new abode, where Renzo had expected such happiness, he should\r\nfind only vexation! This was the result of trifles, doubtless; but it\r\nrequires so little to disturb a state of happiness in this life!\r\n\r\nThe reports the Bergamascans had heard of Lucy, together with Renzo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextraordinary attachment to her\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, too, the representations of\r\nsome partial friend\xe2\x80\x94had contributed to excite an extravagant idea of\r\nher beauty. When Lucy appeared, they began to shrug their shoulders, and\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the woman? We expected something very different! What is\r\nshe, after all? A peasant, like a thousand others! Women like her, and\r\nfairer than she, are to be found every where!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some kind friends told Renzo these things, perhaps added\r\nto what they had heard, and roused his indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\r\nconsequence is it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWho told you what to expect? Did I\r\never do so? Did I tell you she was beautiful? She is a peasant,\r\nforsooth! Did I ever say I would bring a princess here? She does not\r\nplease you. Do not look at her, then: you have beautiful women; look at\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus did he make himself unhappy; and believing that all were\r\ndisposed to criticise his Lucy, he showed ill nature in return. It would\r\nhave gone ill with him, if he had been condemned to remain in the place;\r\nbut fortune smiled on him in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe master of another manufactory, situated near the gates of Bergamo,\r\nbeing dead, the inheritor of it, a young libertine, was willing to sell\r\nit half price, for ready money. Bortolo proposed to his cousin that they\r\nshould make the purchase together. They did so; and when they entered\r\ninto possession, Lucy was much pleased, and Renzo also, and not the less\r\nso for having heard that more than one person amongst his neighbours had\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen this beautiful simpleton who is just come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir affairs now went on prosperously. Before the year was completed,\r\na beautiful little creature made her appearance, as if to give them the\r\nearliest opportunity of fulfilling Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s vow. Be assured it was named\r\nMaria. In the course of time, they were surrounded by others of both\r\nsexes, whom Agnes was delighted to carry about one after the other,\r\ncalling them little rogues, and loading them with kisses. They were all\r\ntaught to read and write; \xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Renzo, \xe2\x80\x9cas this notion is in the\r\ncountry, we may as well take advantage of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was highly pleasing to hear him relate his adventures: he always\r\nconcluded by naming the great things he had learnt, by which to govern\r\nhis conduct for the future. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learnt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to mix in\r\nquarrels; not to preach in public; not to drink more than I want; not to\r\nkeep my hand on the knocker of a door, when the inhabitants of the place\r\nare all crazy; not to tie a little bell to my feet, before I think of\r\nthe consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucy, who thought that the doctrine of her moralist,\r\nthough sound, was rather confused, and certainly incomplete\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat have\r\nI learnt?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not sought misfortunes, they have sought\r\nme. Unless you say,\xe2\x80\x9d smiling affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my error was in\r\nloving you, and promising myself to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey settled the question, by deciding that misfortunes most commonly\r\nhappen to us from our own misconduct or imprudence; but sometimes from\r\ncauses independent of ourselves; that the most innocent and prudent\r\nconduct cannot always preserve us from them; and that, whether they\r\narise from our own fault or not, trust in God softens them, and renders\r\nthem useful in preparing us for a better life. Although this was said by\r\npoor peasants, it appears to us so just, that we offer it here as the\r\nmoral of our story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\xe2\x80\x99s note:\r\n\r\nOriginal spelling, even where inconsistent, and punctuation have\r\nbeen preserved.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
